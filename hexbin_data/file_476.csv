4291,Comparison of clinical outcomes between laparoscopic and open surgery for left-sided colon cancer: a nationwide population-based study,2020-01-09,"The role of laparoscopic surgery for left-sided colon cancer has been supported by the results of randomized controlled trials. However, its benefits and disadvantages in the real world setting should be further assessed with population-based studies.The hospitalization data of patients undergoing open or laparoscopic surgery for left-sided colon cancer were sourced from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Patient and hospital characteristics and perioperative outcomes including length of hospital stay, operation time, opioid use, blood transfusion, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and use of mechanical ventilation were compared. The overall survival was also assessed. Patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery had shorter hospital stay (p < 0.0001) and less demand for opioid analgesia (p = 0.0005). Further logistic regression revealed that patients undergoing open surgery were 1.70, 2.89, and 3.00 times more likely to have blood transfusion, to be admitted to ICU, and to use mechanical ventilation than patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery. Operations performed in medical centers were also associated with less adverse events. The overall survival was comparable between the 2 groups.With adequate hospital quality and volume, laparoscopic surgery for left-sided colon cancer was associated with improved perioperative outcomes. The long-term survival was not compromised.","Huang, Yu-Min; Lee, Yuan-Wen; Huang, Yan-Jiun; Wei, Po-Li",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6952445/,476

Health, self‐esteem, knowledge of the disease and dietary compliance were investigated. The children with coeliac disease were otherwise just as healthy as the control children. Growth and self‐esteem were normal. Good knowledge of coeliac disease and dietary treatment was found in 87% of children and dietary compliance was 81%. Girls and younger children (12–14 years) were more compliant than boys and older children (15–17 years). Compliance correlated positively to knowledge.","Ljungman, G; Myrdal, U",Acta Paediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7188325/,476
10772,The use of PET in COVID 19 cases,2020-05-05,"The novel capsid-binding antiviral pleconaril inhibits in vitro replication of most rhinoviruses and enteroviruses. Oral pleconaril treatment was studied in 2 parallel randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Among 1363 picornavirus-infected participants (65%) in the studies combined, the median time to alleviation of illness was 1 day shorter for pleconaril recipients than for placebo recipients (P > .001). Cold symptom scores and frequency of picornavirus cultured from nasal mucus specimens were lower among pleconaril recipients by day 2 of treatment. No treatment effects were seen in those without picornavirus infection. Pleconaril was associated with a higher incidence of nausea (6% vs. 4%) and diarrhea (9% vs. 7%) and with small increases in mean serum cholesterol levels and platelet counts, compared with baseline measurements. A subsequent 6-week prophylaxis study found that pleconaril induces cytochrome P-450 3A enzymes, which metabolize a variety of drugs, including ethinyl estradiol. Early pleconaril treatment was well tolerated and significantly reduced the duration and severity of colds due to picornaviruses in adults.","Hayden, Frederick G.; Herrington, Darrell T.; Coats, Teresa L.; Kim, Kenneth; Cooper, Ellen C.; Villano, Stephen A.; Liu, Siyu; Hudson, Spencer; Pevear, Daniel C.; Collett, Marc; McKinlay, Mark",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7199898/,476

18836,Uncloaking a Lost Cause: Decolonizing ancestry estimation in the United States,2021-01-18,"BACKGROUND: Chronic non-specific neck pain is highly prevalent, resulting in significant disability. Despite exercise being a mainstay treatment, guidance on optimal exercise and dosage variables is lacking. Combining submaximal effort deep cervical muscles exercise (motor control) and superficial cervical muscles exercise (segmental) reduces chronic non-specific neck pain, but evaluation of optimal exercise and dosage variables is prevented by clinical heterogeneity. OBJECTIVE: To gain consensus on important motor control and segmental exercise and dosage variables for chronic non-specific neck pain. METHODS: An international 3-round e-Delphi study, was conducted with experts in neck pain management (academic and clinical). In round 1, exercise and dosage variables were obtained from expert opinion and clinical trial data, then analysed thematically (two independent researchers) to develop themes and statements. In rounds 2 and 3, participants rated their agreement with statements (1–5 Likert scale). Statement consensus was evaluated using progressively increased a priori criteria using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Thirty-seven experts participated (10 countries). Twenty-nine responded to round 1 (79%), 26 round 2 (70%) and 24 round 3 (65%). Round 1 generated 79 statements outlining the interacting components of exercise prescription. Following rounds 2 and 3, consensus was achieved for 46 important components of exercise and dosage prescription across 5 themes (clinical reasoning, dosage variables, exercise variables, evaluation criteria and progression) and 2 subthemes (progression criteria and progression variables). Excellent agreement and qualitative data supports exercise prescription complexity and the need for individualised, acceptable, and feasible exercise. Only 37% of important exercise components were generated from clinical trial data. Agreement was highest (88%-96%) for 3 dosage variables: intensity of effort, frequency, and repetitions. CONCLUSION: Multiple exercise and dosage variables are important, resulting in complex and individualised exercise prescription not found in clinical trials. Future research should use these important variables to prescribe an evidence-informed approach to exercise.","Price, Jonathan; Rushton, Alison; Tyros, Vasileios; Heneghan, Nicola R.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8248695/,476
19236,Checklist Framework for Surgical Education Disaster Plans,2021-07-12,"Alpha folate receptor (FRα) is currently under investigation as a target for the treatment of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), since it is highly expressed in tumor cells but is largely absent in normal tissue. In this study, a novel human variable domain of a heavy-chain (VH) antibody fragment specific to FRα was enriched and selected by phage bio-planning. The positive phage clone (3A102 VH) specifically bound to FRα and also cross-reacted with FRβ, as tested by ELISA. Clone 3A102 VH was then successfully expressed as a soluble protein in an E. coli shuffle strain. The obtained soluble 3A102 VH demonstrated a high affinity for FRα with affinity constants (K(aff)) values around 7.77 ± 0.25 × 10(7) M(−1), with specific binding against both FRα expressing NSCLC cells and NSCLC patient-derived primary cancer cells, as tested by cell ELISA. In addition, soluble 3A102 VH showed the potential desired property of a targeting molecule by being internalized into FRα-expressing cells, as observed by confocal microscopy. This study inspires the use of phage display to develop human VH antibody (Ab) fragments that might be well suited for drug targeted therapy of NSCLC and other FRα-positive cancer cells.","Parakasikron, Nattihda; Chaotham, Chatchai; Chanvorachote, Pithi; Vinayanuwattikun, Chanida; Buranasudja, Visarut; Taweecheep, Pornchanok; Khantasup, Kannika",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8274507/,476

26193,In the Midst of Stories: Is Seeing Believing?,2017-05-22,"There have been significant improvements in the state of health in the world over the decades: the average global life expectancy since 1960 has increased from just over 50 to over 71; smallpox has been wiped out and the number of deaths from measles, 871,000 in 1999, rapidly fell to an estimated figure of 12,000 in 2012 (thanks to vaccination). However, though there are more than 7 billion people in the world, only 1 billion can expect to lead a long and healthy life. Unlike in the past, health problems are no longer confined within the individual countries. The SARS epidemic, which started in China in 2002, rapidly spread to 29 different countries in 8 months. The emissions of CO(2) in the United States and China may be causing an increase in floods in Bangladesh, as we show in the book. Global health has been defined by the United States Institute of Medicine as all those “health problems, issues, and concerns that transcend national boundaries, may be influenced by circumstances or experiences in other countries, and are best addressed by co-operative actions and solutions.” The concept of global health is connected with another important phenomenon, that of the epidemiological transition, or the continuous process according to which some diseases decline (many infectious diseases and those caused by malnutrition) and others spread (chronic “ non-communicable” diseases). According to many indicators, including health, there is a general convergence of the countries in the world but also great internal inequalities in each country. In this chapter addresses the new health issues raised by globalisation, including the impact of economic and technological changes. In doing so, it tells three exemplary stories of globalisation and health: Nauru (a very early example of the impact of globalisation), Greece (the consequences of the economic crisis) and Bangladesh (one of the countries currently most exposed to the effects of climate change).","Vineis, Paolo",Health Without Borders,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123041/,476

Although compact, this description comes with a level of ambiguity since a single matrix may describe multiple words. This work looks at how considering the Parikh matrices of various transformations of a given word can decrease that ambiguity. More specifically, for any word, we study the Parikh matrix of its Lyndon conjugate as well as that of its projection to a smaller alphabet. Our results demonstrate that ambiguity can often be reduced using these concepts, and we give conditions on when they succeed.","Dick, Jeffery; Hutchinson, Laura K.; Mercaş, Robert; Reidenbach, Daniel",Language and Automata Theory and Applications,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206623/,476

32727,Neurological infections during the COVID-19 epidemic(),2020-05-21,"This article analyzes mid-implementation course corrections in a quality improvement innovation for a maternal and child health network working in a large Midwestern metropolitan area. Participating organizations received restrictive funding from this network to screen pregnant women and new mothers for depression, make appropriate referrals, and log screening and referral data into a project-wide data system over a one-year pilot program. This paper asked three research questions: (1) What problems emerged by mid-implementation of this program that required course correction? (2) How were advocacy targets developed to influence network and agency responses to these mid-course problems? (3) What specific course corrections were identified and implemented to get implementation back on track? This ethnographic case study employs qualitative methods including participant observation and interviews. Data were analyzed using the analytic method of qualitative description, in which the goal of data analysis is to summarize and report an event using the ordinary, everyday terms for that event and the unique descriptions of those present. Three key findings are noted. First, network participants quickly responded to the emerged problem of under-performing screening and referral completion statistics. Second, they shifted advocacy targets away from executive appeals and toward the line staff actually providing screening. Third, participants endorsed two specific course corrections, using “opt out, not opt in” choice architecture at intake and implementing visual incentives for workers to track progress. Opt-out choice architecture and visual incentives served as useful means of focusing organizational collaboration and correcting mid-implementation problems.","McMillin, Stephen Edward",J of Pol Practice & Research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223672/,476

33422,Economic thoughts on the potential implications of COVID‐19 on the Canadian dairy and poultry sectors,2020-05-06,"Early diagnosis of some life-threatening diseases such as cancers and heart is crucial for effective treatments. Supervised machine learning has proved to be a very useful tool to serve this purpose. Historical data of patients including clinical and demographic information is used for training learning algorithms. This builds predictive models that provide initial diagnoses. However, in the medical domain, it is common to have the positive class under-represented in a dataset. In such a scenario, a typical learning algorithm tends to be biased towards the negative class, which is the majority class, and misclassify positive cases. This is known as the class imbalance problem. In this paper, a framework for predictive diagnostics of diseases with imbalanced records is presented. To reduce the classification bias, we propose the usage of an overlap-based undersampling method to improve the visibility of minority class samples in the region where the two classes overlap. This is achieved by detecting and removing negative class instances from the overlapping region. This will improve class separability in the data space. Experimental results show achievement of high accuracy in the positive class, which is highly preferable in the medical domain, while good trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity were obtained. Results also show that the method often outperformed other state-of-the-art and well-established techniques.","Vuttipittayamongkol, Pattaramon; Elyan, Eyad",Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7256568/,476
33432,Labour issues and COVID‐19,2020-04-21,"Cancer, which involves the dysregulation of genes via multiple mechanisms, is unlikely to be fully explained by a single data type. By combining different “omes”, researchers can increase the discovery of novel bio-molecular associations with disease-related phenotypes. Investigation of functional relations among genes associated with the same disease condition may further help to develop more accurate disease-relevant prediction models. In this work, we present an integrative framework called Data & Analytic Integrator (DAI), to explore the relationship between different omics via different mathematical formulations and algorithms. In particular, we investigate the combinatorial use of molecular knowledge identified from omics integration methods netDx, iDRW and SSL, by fusing the derived aggregated similarity matrices and by exploiting these in a semi-supervised learner. The analysis workflows were applied to real-life data for ovarian cancer and underlined the benefits of joint data and analytic integration.","Bhardwaj, Archana; Van Steen, Kristel",Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7256578/,476
33435,Potential implications of COVID‐19 on the Canadian pork industry,2020-04-21,"Surfing is currently one of the most popular water sports in the world, both for recreational and competitive level surfers. Surf session analysis is often performed with commercially available devices. However, most of them seem insufficient considering the surfers’ needs, by displaying a low number of features, being inaccurate, invasive or not adequate for all surfer levels. Despite the fact that performing manoeuvres is the ultimate goal of surfing, there are no available solutions that enable the identification and characterization of such events. In this work, we propose a novel method to detect manoeuvre events during wave riding periods resorting solely to the inertial sensors embedded in smartphones. The proposed method was able to correctly identify over 95% of all the manoeuvres in the dataset (172 annotated manoeuvres), while achieving a precision of up to 80%, using a session-independent validation approach. These findings demonstrate the suitability and validity of the proposed solution for identification of manoeuvre events in real-world conditions, evidencing a high market potential.","Moreira, Dinis; Gomes, Diana; Graça, Ricardo; Bányay, Dániel; Ferreira, Patrícia",Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7256581/,476

Our goal is to use the information from a complete dataset in the form of graphical causal models to impute missing values in an incomplete dataset. This assumes that the datasets have the same data generating process. Furthermore, we calculate the probability of each missing data value belonging to a specified percentile.

The current study compares two approaches for the discovery of relevant variables: by application of a single feature selection algorithm, versus by an ensemble of diverse algorithms. These approaches are used to identify variables that are relevant discerning of four cancer types using RNA-seq profiles from the Cancer Genome Atlas. The comparison is carried out in two directions: evaluating the predictive performance of models and monitoring the stability of selected variables. The most informative features are identified using a four feature selection algorithms, namely U-test, ReliefF, and two variants of the MDFS algorithm. Discerning normal and tumor tissues is performed using the Random Forest algorithm. The highest stability of the feature set was obtained when U-test was used. Unfortunately, models built on feature sets obtained from the ensemble of feature selection algorithms were no better than for models developed on feature sets obtained from individual algorithms. On the other hand, the feature selectors leading to the best classification results varied between data sets.","Polewko-Klim, Aneta; Rudnicki, Witold R.",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7304026/,476

Error variances are obtained from innovation variances empirically related to concentrations using a large data set. We use a k-fold cross-validation approach to estimate the remaining parameters. We note that by minimizing the cross-validation cost function, we obtain the optimal parameters for an optimal Kalman gain. Combined with the innovation variance consistent with the sum of observation and background error variances in observation space, yield a scheme that estimates the true error statistics, thus minimizing the true analysis error. Overall, this yield a new error statistics formulation and estimation out-performs the older optimum interpolation scheme using isotropic covariances with optimized covariance parameters. Yet, the analysis scheme is computationally comparable to optimum interpolation and can be used in real-time operational applications. These new error statistics comes as data-driven models, were we use validation techniques that are common to machine learning. We argue that the error statistics could benefit from a machine learning approach, while the air quality model and analysis scheme derives from physics and statistics.","Ménard, Richard; Cossette, Jean-François; Deshaies-Jacques, Martin",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7304728/,476

However, it has been shown that the availability of a simulator alone is not sufficient to promote practice. Therefore, simulator-based surgical curricula need to be developed and integrated into existing surgical training programs. As practice variation is an important aspect of a surgical curriculum, surgical simulators should support practice on multiple specimens. Furthermore, to ensure that surgical skills are acquired, and to support self-guided learning, automated feedback on performance needs to be provided during practice. Automated feedback is typically provided by comparing real-time performance with expert models generated from pre-collected data. Since collecting data on multiple specimens for the purpose of developing feedback models is costly and time-consuming, methods of transferring feedback from one specimen to another should be investigated. In this paper, we discuss a simple method of feedback transfer between specimens in virtual reality temporal bone surgery and validate the accuracy and effectiveness of the transfer through a user study.","Lamtara, Jesslyn; Hanegbi, Nathan; Talks, Benjamin; Wijewickrema, Sudanthi; Ma, Xingjun; Piromchai, Patorn; Bailey, James; O’Leary, Stephen",Artificial Intelligence in Education,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7334188/,476

To improve the coding efficiency, HEVC adopts the hierarchical quadtree structured Coding Unit (CU). However, the computational complexity significantly increases due to the full search for Rate-Distortion Optimization (RDO) to find the optimal Coding Tree Unit (CTU) partition. Here, this paper proposes a deep learning model to predict the HEVC CU partition at inter-mode, instead of brute-force RDO search. To learn the learning model, a large-scale database for HEVC inter-mode is first built. Second, to predict the CU partition of HEVC, we propose as a model a combination of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network.

These schemes use the fitness improvement ration to change four parameter values for every individual separately, as long as in the MOEA/D framework every individual solves its own scalar optimization problem. The first proposed scheme samples new values and replaces old values with new ones if there is an improvement, while the second one keeps a set of memory cells and updates the parameter values using the weighted sum. The proposed methods are testes on two sets of benchmark problems, namely MOEADDE functions and WFG functions, IGD and HV metrics are calculated. The results comparison is performed with statistical tests. The comparison shows that the proposed parameter adaptation schemes are capable of delivering significant improvements to the performance of the MOEA/D-DE algorithm. Also, it is shown that parameter tuning is better than random sampling of parameter values. The proposed parameter self-adaptation techniques could be used for other multi-objective algorithms, which use MOEA/D framework.","Akhmedova, Shakhnaz; Stanovov, Vladimir",Advances in Swarm Intelligence,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7354791/,476

It will be based on analysis of their behavioral biometric characteristics. One of the major problems in UEBA/DSS intelligent systems is obtaining useful information from a large amount of unstructured, inconsistent data. Management decision-making should be based on real data collected from the analysed feature. However, based on the information received, it is rather difficult to make any management decision, as the data are heterogeneous and their volumes are extremely large. Application of machine learning methods in implementation of mobile UEBA/DSS system is proposed. This will make it possible to achieve a data analysis high quality and find complex dependencies in it. A list of the most significant factors submitted to the input of the analysing methods was formed during the research.","Savenkov, Pavel A.; Ivutin, Alexey N.",Advances in Swarm Intelligence,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7354804/,476

Public health interventions have always had a fundamental role in the control of diseases in cities. WHO considers urbanization as one of the key challenges for public health in the twenty-first century, since cities offer significant opportunities to improve public health if health-enhancing policies and actions are promoted. A multidisciplinary approach is required, but the basic differences existing between technical and health disciplines make the interaction difficult. The multidisciplinary collaboration is still at a very early stage of development, and needs to be further understood and planned. The author concludes stressing the need for a transversal training, but also for sharing knowledge, instruments and methods, involving all the actors in the planning process, to develop a real multidisciplinary approach.","D’Alessandro, Daniela",Urban Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7362667/,476

37522,COVID‐19 lessons can help limit future legal liability,2020-07-14,"BACKGROUND: Fall-related injuries are important public health problem worldwide. We aimed to describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of fall-related injuries in a level 1 trauma center. METHOD: A retrospective analysis of Qatar Trauma Registry data was conducted on patients admitted for fall-related injuries between 2010 and 2017. Comparative analyses of data by gender, age-groups and height of falls were performed to describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients, and in-hospital outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 4040 patients with fall-related injuries were identified in the study duration which corresponds to the rate of 2.34 per 10,000 population. Although the rate of fall-related injuries decreased over the years, the average number of patients per year remained high accounting for 32% of the hospitalized patients with moderate to severe injuries. Most of the injuries affected the head (36%) followed by spines (29%) and chest (23%). Males were predominant (89%), more likely to fall at workplace, fall from a greater height and have polytrauma than females. The working age-group (20–59 years) constituted the majority of injured (73%) and were more likely to fall at workplace, and to fall from higher heights compared to the older adults who sustained more fall at home. Overall in-hospital mortality was 3%. Outcomes including longer hospital length of stay and mortality were generally correlated with the height of fall except for the fall at home. CONCLUSION: Fall-related injuries remain as significant burden even in a level 1 trauma center. Variations in the pattern of injuries by age, gender and height of fall provide important information for targeted preventive measures.","Mekkodathil, Ahammed; El-Menyar, Ayman; Kanbar, Ahad; Hakim, Suhail; Ahmed, Khalid; Siddiqui, Tariq; Al-Thani, Hassan",BMC Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7388431/,476

37670,Return from COVID-19: Thinking Differently About Export Competitiveness and Sustainability,2020-08-09,"ABSTRACT: Desirable features of exosomes have made them a suitable manipulative platform for biomedical applications, including targeted drug delivery, gene therapy, cancer diagnosis and therapy, development of vaccines, and tissue regeneration. Although natural exosomes have various potentials, their clinical application is associated with some inherent limitations. Recently, these limitations inspired various attempts to engineer exosomes and develop designer exosomes. Mostly, designer exosomes are being developed to overcome the natural limitations of exosomes for targeted delivery of drugs and functional molecules to wounds, neurons, and the cardiovascular system for healing of damage. In this review, we summarize the possible improvements of natural exosomes by means of two main approaches: parental cell-based or pre-isolation exosome engineering and direct or post-isolation exosome engineering. Parental cell-based engineering methods use genetic engineering for loading of therapeutic molecules into the lumen or displaying them on the surface of exosomes. On the other hand, the post-isolation exosome engineering approach uses several chemical and mechanical methods including click chemistry, cloaking, bio-conjugation, sonication, extrusion, and electroporation. This review focuses on the latest research, mostly aimed at the development of designer exosomes using parental cell-based engineering and their application in cancer treatment and regenerative medicine.

37836,Thoughts on detecting tissue distribution of potential COVID-19 receptors,2020-08-12,"BACKGROUND: Coronary artery disease is common in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Patients with ESRD are a high-risk group for cardiac surgery and have increased morbidity and mortality. Most studies comparing ESRD patients receiving coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention have found that the long-term survival is good in ESRD patients after CABG. The aim of our study was to compare ESRD patients who underwent CABG with the general population who underwent CABG, in terms of prognosis and hospital costs. METHODS: This study analyzed data from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan for patients who were diagnosed with ESRD and received CABG (ICD-9-CM codes 585 or 586) between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2009. The ESRD patients included in this study all received catastrophic illness cards with the major illness listed as ESRD from the Ministry of Health and Welfare in Taiwan. The control subjects were randomly selected patients without ESRD after propensity score matching with ESRD patients according to age, gender, and comorbidities at a 2:1 ratio from the same dataset. RESULTS: A total of 48 ESRD patients received CABG, and their mean age was 62.04 ± 10.04 years. Of these patients, 29.2% were aged ≥70 years, and 66.7% were male. ESRD patients had marginally higher intensive care unit (ICU) stays (11.06 vs 7.24 days) and significantly higher ICU costs (28,750 vs 17,990 New Taiwan Dollars (NTD)) than non-ESRD patients. Similarly, ESRD patients had significantly higher surgical costs (565,200 vs. 421,890 NTD), a higher perioperative mortality proportion (10.4% vs 2.1%) and a higher postoperative mortality proportion (33.3% vs 11.5%) than non-ESRD patients. CONCLUSIONS: After CABG, ESRD patients had a higher risk of mortality than non-ESRD patients, and ICU and surgery costs were also higher among the ESRD patients than among patients without ESRD.","Liao, Kuang-Ming; Kuo, Lu-Ting; Lu, Hsueh-Yi",BMC Nephrol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7414285/,476

38006,What COVID‐19 could mean for security operations during fall athletics,2020-08-10,"BACKGROUND: Most pediatric palliative care (PPC) services are inpatient consultation services and do not reach patients and families in the outpatient and home settings, where a vast majority of oncology care occurs. We explored whether an embedded pediatric palliative oncology (PPO) clinic is associated with receipt and timing of PPC and hospital days in the last 90 days of life. METHODS: Oncology patients (ages 0–25) with a high-risk event (death, relapse/progression, and/or phase I/II clinical trial enrollment) between 07/01/2015 and 06/30/2018 were included. PPO clinic started July 2017. Two cohorts were defined: pre-PPO (high-risk event(s) occurring 07/01/2015–06/30/2017) and post-PPO (high-risk event(s) occurring 07/01/2017–06/30/2018). Descriptive statistics were performed; demographic, disease course, and outcomes variables across cohorts were compared. RESULTS: A total of 426 patients were included (pre-PPO n = 235; post-PPO n = 191). Forty-seven patients with events in both pre- and post-PPO cohorts were included in the post-PPO cohort. Mean age at diagnosis was 8 years. Diagnoses were evenly distributed among solid tumors, brain tumors, and leukemia/lymphoma. Post-PPO cohort patients received PPC more often (45.6% vs. 21.3%, p < 0.0001), for a longer time before death than the pre-PPO cohort (median 88 vs. 32 days, p = 0.027), and spent fewer days hospitalized in the last 90 days of life (median 3 vs. 8 days, p = 0.0084). CONCLUSION: A limited-day, embedded PPO clinic was associated with receipt of PPC and spending more time at home in patients with cancer who had high-risk events. Continued improvements to these outcomes would be expected with additional oncology provider education and PPO personnel.","Brock, Katharine E.; Allen, Kristen E.; Falk, Erin; Velozzi-Averhoff, Cristina; DeGroote, Nicholas P.; Klick, Jeffrey; Wasilewski-Masker, Karen",Support Care Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7419028/,476

Maintaining a certain standard of care whilst ensuring the safety of patients and staff in our small Singapore-based breast imaging center are equally important and has resulted in modifications of our clinical practice and workflows. Screening patients for COVID-19 symptoms, risk factors, and potential exposure history has become paramount. Workflow changes have also included progressively deferring, and in some cases halting, nonessential services such as biopsies deemed to have a low risk of malignancy, routine follow-up imaging in postoperative patients or those with prior Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System 3 findings, and mammographic screening. Breast radiologists within our practice are also adapting to the changing landscape by playing a more active role in general radiology and emergency department reporting in order to reduce turnaround time and facilitate the discharge of inpatients. We have also enabled a sense of geographical segregation within our breast center to reduce potential exposure and cross-contamination risks. Although the near future remains uncertain, breast imaging within the broader scope of radiology practice will have to continually adjust to meet the ever-changing realities as this pandemic evolves.","Mirpuri, Tarun M; Wah, Margaret L Y; Siew, Steven W B; Upadhyaya, Vidya S",J Breast Imaging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7454651/,476

39917,Entrepreneurial educators: vital enablers to support the education sector to reimagine and respond to the challenges of COVID-19,2020-09-28,"OBJECTIVE: The proportion of US emergency department (ED) visits that lead to hospitalization has declined over time. The degree to which advanced imaging use contributed to this trend is unknown. Our objective was to examine the association between advanced imaging use during ED visits and changes in ED hospitalization rates between 2007–2008 and 2015–2016. METHODS: We analyzed data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. The primary outcome was ED hospitalization, including admission to inpatient and observation units and outside transfers. The primary exposure was advanced imaging during the ED visit, including computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasound. We constructed a survey-weighted multivariable logistic regression with binary outcome of ED hospitalization to examine changes in adjusted hospitalization rates from 2007–2008 to 2015–2016, comparing ED visits with and without advanced imaging. RESULTS: ED patients who received advanced imaging (versus those who did not) were more likely to be 65 years or older (25.3% vs 13.0%), non-Hispanic white (65.3% vs 58.5%), female (58.4% vs 54.1%), and have Medicare (26.5% vs 16.0%). Among ED visits with advanced imaging, adjusted annual hospitalization rate declined from 22.5% in 2007–2008 to 17.3% (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] 0.77; 95% CI 0.68, 0.86) in 2015–2016. In the same periods, among ED visits without advanced imaging, adjusted annual hospitalization rate declined from 14.3% to 11.6% (aRR 0.81; 95% CI 0.73, 0.90). The aRRs between ED visits with and without advanced imaging were not significantly different. CONCLUSION: From 2007–2016, ED visits with advanced imaging did not have a greater reduction in admission rate compared to those without advanced imaging. Our results suggest that increasing advanced imaging use likely had a limited role in the general decline in hospital admissions from EDs. Future research is needed to further validate this finding.","Chou, Shih-Chuan; Nagurney, Justine M.; Schuur, Jeremiah D.; Weiner, Scott G.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7494122/,476
39993,Niedergelassen - sitzengelassen? Über den COVID-19-Schutzschirm,2020-10-05,"PURPOSE: Research evaluating the effect of probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics (PPS) on laboratory markers of health (such as immunomodulatory and microbiota changes) is growing but it is unclear whether these markers translate to improved functional outcomes in the older population. This systematic review evaluates the effect of PPS on functional outcomes in older people. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the effect of PPS in older adults on functional outcomes (physical strength, frailty, mood and cognition, mortality and receipt of care). Four electronic databases were searched for studies published since year 2000. RESULTS: Eighteen studies (including 15 RCTs) were identified. One of five studies evaluating physical function reported benefit (improved grip strength). Two analyses of one prebiotic RCT assessed frailty by different methods with mixed results. Four studies evaluated mood with no benefit reported. Six studies evaluated cognition: four reported cognitive improvement in participants with pre-existing cognitive impairment receiving probiotics. Seven studies reported mortality as a secondary outcome with a trend to reduction in only one. Five studies reported length of hospital stay but only two peri-operative studies reported shorter stays. CONCLUSION: There is limited evidence that probiotics may improve cognition in older people with pre-existing cognitive impairment but no clear evidence of benefit of PPS on physical function, frailty, mood, length of hospitalisation and mortality. Larger studies with more homogenous interventions, accounting for confounding factors, such as diet, co-morbidities and medications, are required. There is currently inadequate evidence to recommend PPS use to older people in general. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: PROSPERO registration number is CRD42020173417.

The study reacted rapidly to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, deploying an online questionnaire early on during lockdown (from 9 (th) April to 15 (th) May). In late May 2020, a second questionnaire was developed asking about physical and mental health, lifestyle and behaviours, employment and finances. The online questionnaire was deployed across the parent and offspring generations between the 26th May and 5 (th) July 2020. 6482 participants completed the questionnaire (2639 original mothers, 1039 original fathers/partners, 2711 offspring (mean age ~28 years) and 93 partners of offspring). 1039 new participants who did not respond to the first questionnaire deployed in April completed the second questionnaire.

Border measures such as entry screening, quarantine and communication are implemented to stop or slow down the spread of COVID-19. Temperature screening at airports, denied access to ports for cruise ships with suspected cases on-board, long-lasting quarantine on board of a cruise ship or temporary suspending cross-border train traffic are just some examples of how PoE are affected by the current outbreak situation. 1. Experiences, challenges and needs of PoE in Europe. 2. Communication and information strategies are crucial in an outbreak situation. The workshop will display case-based examples and emphasize on the challenges and efficacy of different strategies during the COVID-19 outbreak. In addition, the need for and experiences of information exchange between POE will be stressed and illustrated. 3. An outbreak situation with a formerly unknown, novel virus such as Sars-CoV-2 requires specific education and training at POE. Practice examples of educational measures (such as e. g. personal instructions, written material, webinars etc.) as well as challenges in rapid development of training material and in assessing specific training needs will be highlighted. 4. What can we learn so far from COVID-19 outbreak management at PoE in Europe? Some preliminary practice recommendations for PoE will be put to discussion. Preliminary results of a survey on how POE dealt with COVID-19 and the specific training needs PoE encountered in this situation will also be presented at the workshop. PoE in Europe, and all over the world, play an important role in the COVID-19 outbreak. This session provides the opportunity to discuss experiences and challenges of COVID-19 outbreak management at PoE from European countries and thereby contributes to skill building and knowledge exchange among experts from the field to learn for future outbreaks. KEY MESSAGES: COVID-19 is a major challenge for PoE across Europe. Diverse and partly non-coherent measures for the outbreak management have been put in place at PoE leaving room for harmonization. Communication and information as well as specific education and training on site are particularly challenging and put burden on PoE staff. Adaptive communication and training strategies are needed.

This pattern has been demonstrated for many chronic and acute injuries and illnesses, but to the author’s knowledge, there is sparse literature on this study on outcomes related to the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 has become a pandemic of global importance with significant impact on all elements of society. As part of quality assurance, as becoming confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 would be adverse clinical news, a review was undertaken to see if there were ethnic differences in the veteran population being tested at the Veteran Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) on the risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: As part of a quality assurance/quality improvement project, a manual retrospective review of all SARS-CoV- 2 RT-PCR tests performed at the VAMC from March 11th, 2020 to April 13th, 2020. These tests were reviewed within the computerized medical record system to determine the age, gender, ethnicity of the patients, and test result of the patient. RESULTS: There were 571 patients who had tested for SARS-CoV-2. Out of these patients, 99 of these patients had a positive test result. The ethnic breakdown of the unique patients with a positive test result was 67 were African- American (68% of positive results), 2 Asian-American (2%), 1 Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander/Hispanic mixed (1%), 17 Caucasian (17%), and 12 declined to answer or left ethnic field unanswered. Among the 471 who had negative results, only 197 or 42% were African American and 118 were Caucasian (25%). CONCLUSION: African Americans had more infections with SARS-CoV-2 compared to the other ethnic groups. Caucasians had many of the negative results, and positive results were otherwise not common in the other ethnic groups in the VAMC cohort. Given this first report in the literature of the disproportionate impact SARS-CoV-2 is having on those of African American ethnicity, appropriate clinical access and low threshold to test is essential.","Petersen, J M; Dalal, S; Jhala, D",Am J Clin Pathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7665283/,476

42252,Keep accessibility central in COVID‐19 mitigation plans,2020-10-05,"The COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected the work of police agencies worldwide. Within a short period of time, the police were assigned new responsibilities and were required to change their priorities and focus on enforcing unusual emergency orders. These new tasks, as well as the emergency atmosphere and its socio-psychological implications, raise a series of questions about public expectations from and trust in the police during the pandemic period. In this article, we report the views of majority communities in Israel (non-Orthodox Jews), as expressed in a survey carried out in the midst of the pandemic. We find that this population supports police enforcement of the new orders and trusts them to do so with integrity, believes the police have been successful in this arena, and is willing to report violations of emergency regulations. Overall, responses indicate more favourable attitudes towards the police, echoing previous findings on policing emergencies.","Perry, Gali; Jonathan-Zamir, Tal",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7665771/,476
42300,Understanding the spatio‐temporal pattern of COVID‐19 outbreak in India using GIS and India's response in managing the Pandemic,2020-10-06,"AIMS: To develop a core outcome set of measurements from postoperative radiographs that can be used to assess technical skill in performing dynamic hip screw (DHS) and hemiarthroplasty, and to validate these against Van der Vleuten’s criteria for effective assessment. METHODS: A Delphi exercise was undertaken at a regional major trauma centre to identify candidate measurement items. The feasibility of taking these measurements was tested by two of the authors (HKJ, GTRP). Validity and reliability were examined using the radiographs of operations performed by orthopaedic resident participants (n = 28) of a multicentre randomized controlled educational trial (ISRCTN20431944). Trainees were divided into novice and intermediate groups, defined as having performed < ten or ≥ ten cases each for DHS and hemiarthroplasty at baseline. The procedure-based assessment (PBA) global rating score was assumed as the gold standard assessment for the purposes of concurrent validity. Intra- and inter-rater reliability testing were performed on a random subset of 25 cases. RESULTS: In total, 327 DHS and 248 hemiarthroplasty procedures were performed by 28 postgraduate year (PGY) 3 to 5 orthopaedic trainees during the 2014 to 2015 surgical training year at nine NHS hospitals in the West Midlands, UK. Overall, 109 PBAs were completed for DHS and 80 for hemiarthroplasty. Expert consensus identified four ‘final product analysis’ (FPA) radiological parameters of technical success for DHS: tip-apex distance (TAD); lag screw position in the femoral head; flushness of the plate against the lateral femoral cortex; and eight-cortex hold of the plate screws. Three parameters were identified for hemiarthroplasty: leg length discrepancy; femoral stem alignment; and femoral offset. Face validity, content validity, and feasibility were excellent. For all measurements, performance was better in the intermediate compared with the novice group, and this was statistically significant for TAD (p < 0.001) and femoral stem alignment (p = 0.023). Concurrent validity was poor when measured against global PBA score. This may be explained by the fact that they are measuring difference facets of competence. Intra-and inter-rater reliability were excellent for TAD, moderate for lag screw position (DHS), and moderate for leg length discrepancy (hemiarthroplasty). Use of a large multicentre dataset suggests good generalizability of the results to other settings. Assessment using FPA was time- and cost-effective compared with PBA. CONCLUSION: Final product analysis using post-implantation radiographs to measure technical skill in hip fracture surgery is feasible, valid, reliable, and cost-effective. It can complement traditional workplace-based assessment for measuring performance in the real-world operating room . It may have particular utility in competency-based training frameworks and for assessing skill transfer from the simulated to live operating theatre.

43320,A Novel Survey Platform in the Age of COVID-19 to Increase Accuracy and Adoptability While Reducing Selection Bias,2020-12-16,"Objective: The resource group method for people with severe mental illness might provide a useful framework to facilitate patient's empowerment and systematically engage significant others. However, no research has explored the perspectives and experiences of patients and their significant others. This is crucial for better adjustment to the needs of the people using the method. The aim of this study was to develop a useful framework for a deeper understanding of the resource group method and its outcomes. Method: The study used a longitudinal, qualitative multiple case-study design based on grounded theory methodology. During a period of 2 years, the developments and processes in eight resource groups were explored by conducting a total of 74 interviews (e.g., with patients, significant others, and mental health professionals) and 26 observations of resource group meetings. Results: Analysis showed that a well-functioning resource group set the stage for five processes to unfold: (i) experience of support; (ii) acknowledgment of significant others; (iii) activation; (iv) openness; and (v) integration. These processes facilitated recovery both in terms of an arousing curiosity within the patient as well as increasing reciprocity and equality in their social relations. In addition, the method emphasized the uniqueness of each recovery journey, thereby providing a framework to shape recovery-oriented care. The analysis also revealed three hindering factors: (i) embedding and implementation issues; (ii) predominant network; and (iii) tensions inherent in the resource group setting. Conclusion: Working according to the resource group method involves that the person's recovery work becomes a social process that takes place in relation to the social environment and everyday life in which it is important to acknowledge and integrate the needs of significant others in treatment and care. This study provides a first step toward a multidimensional comprehension of the resource group method, the working mechanisms and its influence on recovery for people with severe mental illness.","Tjaden, Cathelijn D.; Boumans, Jenny; Mulder, Cornelis L.; Kroon, Hans",Front Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7732607/,476
43331,"#BoomerRemover: COVID-19, Ageism, and the Intergenerational Twitter Response",2020-12-16,"A post-resuscitation shock occurs in 50–70% of patients who had a cardiac arrest. It is an early and transient complication of the post-resuscitation phase, which frequently leads to multiple-organ failure and high mortality. The pathophysiology of post-resuscitation shock is complex and results from the whole-body ischemia–reperfusion process provoked by the sequence of circulatory arrest, resuscitation manoeuvers and return of spontaneous circulation, combining a myocardial dysfunction and sepsis features, such as vasoplegia, hypovolemia and endothelial dysfunction. Similarly to septic shock, the hemodynamic management of post-resuscitation shock is based on an early and aggressive hemodynamic management, including fluid administration, vasopressors and/or inotropes. Norepinephrine should be considered as the first-line vasopressor in order to avoid arrhythmogenic effects of other catecholamines and dobutamine is the most established inotrope in this situation. Importantly, the optimal mean arterial pressure target during the post-resuscitation shock still remains unknown and may probably vary according to patients. Mechanical circulatory support by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation can be necessary in the most severe patients, when the neurological prognosis is assumed to be favourable. Other symptomatic treatments include protective lung ventilation with a target of normoxia and normocapnia and targeted temperature management by avoiding the lowest temperature targets. Early coronary angiogram and coronary reperfusion must be considered in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients with preserved neurological prognosis although the timing of coronary angiogram in non-STEMI patients is still a matter of debate. Further clinical research is needed in order to explore new therapeutic opportunities regarding inflammatory, hormonal and vascular dysfunction.","Jozwiak, Mathieu; Bougouin, Wulfran; Geri, Guillaume; Grimaldi, David; Cariou, Alain",Ann Intensive Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7734609/,476

Risk of infection is influenced generally by age and existing comorbidities as well as especially by activity of the rheumatic disease and immunosuppressive treatment. Correspondingly best possible reduction of disease activity and elimination or at least successful treatment of comorbidities are able to reduce infection risk. Patients at high risk of infection should be identified and be monitored in an intensified way. Furthermore risk is influenced by antirheumatic treatment, e.g. enhanced by long-term glucocorticoid treatment, reduced by optimisied use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs leading to best possible disease control. Finally protective antibiotic or antiviral treatment (e.g. in case of latent tuberculosis or hepatitis) as well as optimised vaccination status are able to reduce risk of infection further.","Kneitz, Christian; Krüger, Klaus",Z Rheumatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7738775/,476
43397,An Action Research Method for Generating Human-Centered COVID-19 Caregiving Interventions,2020-12-16,"BACKGROUND: Upon re-examination of our human history, evolutionary perspectives, and genetics, a prevailing iron deficiency phenotype appears to have evolved to protect the human race from extinction. BODY: In this review, we summarize the evolutionary and genetic perspectives pointing towards the hypothesis that low iron mitigates infection. The presence of infection promotes the generation of resistance alleles, and there are some evolutionary and genetic clues that suggest the presence of an iron deficiency phenotype that may have developed to protect against infection. Examples include the relative paucity of iron overload genes given the essential role of iron, as well as the persistence of iron deficiency among populations in spite of public health efforts to treat it. Additional examination of geographic areas with severe iron deficiency in the setting of pandemics including H1N1, SARS, and COVID-19 reveals that areas with higher prevalence of iron deficiency are less affected. RNA viruses have several evolutionary adaptations which suggest their absolute need for iron, and this dependency may be exploited during treatment. CONCLUSION: RNA viruses pose a unique challenge to modern healthcare, with an average of 2–3 new pathogens being discovered yearly. Their overarching requirements for iron, along with human evolutionary and genetic adaptations which favored an iron deficiency phenotype, ultimately suggest the potential need for iron control in these infections.","Menshawey, Rahma; Menshawey, Esraa; Alserr, Ayman H.

43500,Consider the Possibility of a COVID‐19 Impact Fund,2020-12-03,"In March 2020, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic and frequently presented as a virus primarily affecting older adults. News headlines led with statements such as, “Coronavirus deaths are so far mostly older men” (Ramzy, 2020). Although later determined inaccurate, this perspective contributed to openly ageist views and exchanges from people around the world. On the social media platform of Twitter, #BoomerRemover was used as a hashtag to express views related to older adults, and particularly baby boomers, as the primary targets of COVID-19. This study uses qualitative methods to analyze the messages of Twitter users that discuss COVID-19 with the use of the hashtag #BoomerRemover. A total of 1,875 tweets posted in English and including the hashtag “#BoomerRemover” from March 16, 2020 to March 30, 2020 were analyzed. Analytic methods employed an open coding procedure consistent with grounded theory and Numeric Content Analysis (Marks, 2015). Salient themes include: (1) COVID-19 is Politically Driven (2) There’s a Real Intergenerational Divide, (3) Young People are Dying Too, and (4) #BoomerRemover is Simply Disrespectful. Findings suggest that only about a fourth of #BoomerRemover tweets could be considered ageist, and the large majority of tweets using the hashtag were related to politics and elections. Further, several of those using the #BoomerRemover hashtag to defend older adults were inadvertently causing it to remain relevant (trend) as a Twitter topic. This study recognizes the importance of considering Twitter – primarily composed of young adults – as a place where intergenerational attitudes vis-à-vis COVID-19 may be expressed.","Skipper, Antonius; Rose, Daniel",Innov Aging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7741122/,476

43738,COVID-19: Journey so far and Deep Insight Using Crowdsourced Data in India,2021-01-03,"The Covid-19 crisis has revamped the discussion about the redefinition of GVC. This paper contributes to the debate, analysing the productive relationships between European countries in four key manufacturing activities. In particular, the paper addresses two objectives. First, it maps the degree of productive integration in Europe, focusing on the generation of employment in the production of exported intermediate inputs and final goods. Second, it provides a preliminary assessment of the potential impact on employment that the current economic crisis will have on some manufacturing activities across Europe. The analysis is realised employing the concept of vertically integrated labour (Pasinetti 1973) which allows to account for the employment directly and indirectly involved in the production of final goods. The estimations are derived from Multi-Regional Input–Output tables to map the supply chain and to differentiate between the employment involved in the production of exported intermediate inputs and final goods. The results show that most of the employment involved in the production of final output of the activities studied in the paper is linked to international trade. Although Europe shows a high degree of productive links, there are important differences in the modality of insertion in the productive structure of European countries. Moreover, the impact on the level of employment due to the current economic crisis can be significant, affecting more than 1.3 million of people in Europe. These results are relevant to policy makers, who should consider carefully the high degree of linkages of the European economies when designing industrial policies and measure of support to the economy.","Villani, Davide; Fana, Marta",J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7758163/,476
43786,Virtual hackathon to tackle COVID-19 unmet needs,2020-12-28,"Gene-editing techniques are becoming powerful tools for modifying target genes in organisms. Although several methods have been reported that detect mutations at targeted loci induced by the CRISPR/Cas system in different organisms, they are semiquantitative and have difficulty in the detection of mutants in processed food samples containing low initial concentrations of DNA and may not accurately quantify editing frequency, especially at very low frequencies in a complex polyploid plant genome. In this study, we developed a duplexed dPCR-based method for the detection and evaluation of gene-editing frequencies in plants. We described the design, performance, accurate quantification, and comparison with other detection systems. The results show that the dPCR-based method is sensitive to different kinds of gene-editing mutations induced by gene-editing. Moreover, the method is applicable to polyploid plants and processed food samples containing low initial concentrations of DNA. Compared with qPCR and NGS-based methods, the dPCR method has a lower limit of detection (LOD) of the editing frequency and a better relationship with the expected editing frequency in detecting the edited region of gene-edited rice samples. Taken together, the duplexed dPCR assay is accurate and precise, and it will be a powerful tool for the detection and evaluation of gene-editing frequencies in plants in gene-editing technology.","Peng, Cheng; Zheng, Ming; Ding, Lin; Chen, Xiaoyun; Wang, Xiaofu; Feng, Xuping; Wang, Junmin; Xu, Junfeng",Front Plant Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7767858/,476
44609,The COVID-19 Outbreak in North Africa: A Legal Analysis,2021-01-13,"BACKGROUND: Although patients undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) due to acute kidney injury (AKI) frequently have instability in mean arterial pressure (MAP), no consensus exists on the target value of MAP related to high mortality after CRRT. METHODS: A total of 2,292 patients who underwent CRRT due to AKI in three referral hospitals were retrospectively reviewed. The MAPs were divided into tertiles, and the 3(rd) tertile group served as a reference in the analyses. The major outcome was all-cause mortality during the intensive care unit period. The odds ratio (OR) of mortality was calculated using logistic regression after adjustment for multiple covariates. The nonlinear relationship regression model was applied to determine the threshold value of MAP related to increasing mortality. RESULTS: The mean value of MAP was 80.7 ± 17.3 mmHg at the time of CRRT initiation. The median intensive care unit stay was 5 days (interquartile range, 2–12 days), and during this time, 1,227 (55.5%) patients died. The 1(st) tertile group of MAP showed an elevated risk of mortality compared with the 3(rd) tertile group (adjusted OR, 1.28 [1.03–1.60]; P = 0.029). In the nonlinear regression analysis, the threshold value of MAP was calculated as 82.7 mmHg. Patients with MAP < 82.7 mmHg had a higher mortality rate than those with ≥ 82.7 mmHg (adjusted OR, 1.21 [1.01–1.45]; P = 0.037). CONCLUSIONS: Low MAP at CRRT initiation is associated with a high risk of mortality, particularly when it is < 82.7 mmHg. This value may be used for risk classification and as a potential therapeutic target.

44845,Documenting COVID-19,2020-12-01,"Vial-based lyophilization for biopharmaceuticals has been an indispensable cornerstone process for over 50 years. However, the process is not without significant challenges. Capital costs to realize a lyophilized drug product facility, for example, are very high. Similarly, heat and mass transfer limitations inherent in lyophilization result in drying cycle on the order of several days while putting practical constraints on available formulation space, such as solute mass percentage or fill volume in a vial. Through collaboration with an external partner, we are exploring microwave vacuum drying (MVD) as a faster drying process to vial lyophilization wherein the heat transfer process occurs by microwave radiation instead of pure conduction from the vial. Drying using this radiative process demonstrates greater than 80% reduction in drying time over traditional freeze-drying times while maintaining product activity and stability. Such reduction in freeze-drying process times from days to several hours is a welcome change as it enables flexible manufacturing by being able to better react to changes either in terms of product volume for on-demand manufacturing scenarios or facilities for production (e.g., scale-out over scale-up). Additionally, by utilizing first-principle modeling coupled with experimental verification, a mechanism for faster drying times associated with MVD is proposed in this article. This research, to the best of our knowledge, forms the very first report of utilizing microwave vacuum drying for vaccines while utilizing the power of simplified models to understand drying principles associated with MVD.","Bhambhani, Akhilesh; Stanbro, Justin; Roth, Daniel; Sullivan, Elizabeth; Jones, Morrisa; Evans, Robert; Blue, Jeffrey",AAPS PharmSciTech,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7814865/,476

Indeed, the European institutional architecture can be viewed as being halfway between an association of sovereign states (like the United Nations) and a politically integrated federation (like the United States). In this original construction, competences on several matters (such as economic, political, social and health issues) are shared at the European level, but also at the national and local levels, in more complex ways than in fully integrated federations. To improve the European Union’s resilience to violent external shocks, the main objective of this paper is to determine to what extent these competences should be transferred to the federal level. In this respect, we will consider whether a federal leap is necessary in several areas, namely (i) monetary and fiscal policy (rules), (ii) labor markets policy and social models, migratory flows and skill shortages, and cooperation policy and (iii) renewed industrial policy and exchange rates.

However, such systems raise serious privacy and data protection concerns. Misuse of data, compromising the privacy of individuals and/or authorized processing of data may be irreversible and could have severe consequences on the individual’s rights to privacy and data protection. This is partly due to the lack of methods and guidance for the integration of data protection and privacy by design in the system development process. In this paper, we present an example of privacy and data protection best practices to provide more guidance for data controllers and developers on how to comply with the legal obligation for data protection. These privacy and data protection best practices and considerations are based on the lessons learned from the SMart mobILity at the European land borders (SMILE) project.","Abomhara, Mohamed; Yayilgan, Sule Yildirim",Intelligent Technologies and Applications,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972001/,476

Radiological investigation combining with machine learning can serve as a standardized methodology for detecting COVID-19. Chest X-ray imaging is the most feasible radiological test for COVID-19. Machine learning-based automated classification of COVID-19 from chest X-ray images can act as an assistive method to the medical experts for accurate diagnosis of disease. Aiming at this, the study focused on developing a simplified method of X-ray image based computerized COVID-19 detection through conventional feature extraction and classification approach. The method of X-ray image based COVID-19 detection consists of only two main steps: feature extraction, and classification. In feature extraction, a total of 55 X-ray image texture features is extracted from seven different groups. Classification of COVID-19 has been performed using those extracted features through four different popularly used classifiers. The overall analysis of the study has been performed over two datasets. The Random Forest classifier generates the best accuracy of 98.6% and 98.9% for dataset 1 and 2 with the area under the curve (AUC) values 0.99 and 1 respectively. The outcome of our study provides optimal accuracy of COVID-19 classification using X-ray images compare to existing popular studies in this domain. The reliable and less-complex feature of the proposed method may serve it as a computerized X-ray image based COVID-19 detection mechanism, especially in rural areas where medical experts are not available.","Bardhan, Shawli; Roga, Sukanta",Emerging Technologies During the Era of COVID-19 Pandemic,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7980161/,476

Although there has been much progress in the development and evaluation of evidence-based treatments for child and adolescent mental health problems, limitations in the accessibility and acceptability of supported care have significantly restricted actual service utilization among affected youth. In recent years, extraordinary advances in telecommunications and the increasing ubiquity of digital technologies in daily life afford new opportunities for meaningfully extending the reach and scope of supported youth mental health care. Remote technologies have potential to liberate mental health treatments from their traditional geographic confines and overcome geographic disparities in the mental health workforce, increase the cost-effectiveness of care, and expand the ecological validity and generalizability of care by affording in situ intervention, and systematically extend treatment engagement and skill rehearsal to children’s natural settings. The authors conclude by examining exciting new frontiers on the horizon for the incorporation of digital technologies into children’s mental health care.","Poznanski, Bridget; Silva, Karina; Conroy, Kristina; Georgiadis, Christopher; Comer, Jonathan S.",Handbook of Evidence-Based Therapies for Children and Adolescents,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7991474/,476

However, fewer approaches have employed a critical lens to explore how power and its relation to students, schools, and higher education institutions shape students’ college pathways and trajectories. In this current chapter, Black Feminist Thought (Collins, Social Problems, 33(6):s14–s32, 1986; Collins, Black feminist thought: Knowledge, consciousness, and the politics of empowerment, Routledge, 2002) is employed to examine how intersecting systems of oppression (i.e., institutionalized racism, sexism, capitalism, etc.) and power shape the college “choice” process. I extend on previous literature on educational inequities to consider the structural forces that constrain educational opportunities. In particular, through the standpoint of Black women and girls, I rely on constructs such as the matrix of domination and controlling images to highlight the limits of college “choice.” The aim is to the examine the various ways “choice” is constrained for Black women and girls, in order to develop transformative mechanisms to improve access to adequate education, increase college participation, and enhance life opportunities. Findings include how narrow depictions of Black women and girls and the trope of the advantaged Black woman in education stifle educational opportunity.","McLewis, Channel C.",Higher Education: Handbook of Theory and Research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7991482/,476

Using a simultaneous equations approach, our main findings indicate that the proportion of independent directors, the board size, and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) power affected bank risk-taking negatively during the recent financial crisis. On the contrary, institutional shareholder ownership and the presence of an ex-CEO as Chairman influenced bank risk-taking positively. Additionally, we separately analyse stable and crisis periods and observe that in the pre-crisis period only board independence and institutional ownership keep the same impact on risk while CEO power has no influence and the existence of an ex-CEO as Chairman reduces risk-taking by banks. We conclude that different governance characteristics have different relevance for banks' risk-taking contingent on the economic environment being one of stability or crisis.","Fernandes, Catarina; Farinha, Jorge; Martins, Francisco Vitorino; Mateus, Cesario",J Bank Regul,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7993444/,476

We confront this problem focusing on emerging innovative solutions to cope with unexpected and harmful problems posed by crises and needing a rapid, effective response. We specifically analyze the patterns of critical innovations to cope with new coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) that is generating public health and economic issues worldwide. Accordingly, in the context of the theory of technological exaptation, we adopted a narrative approach examining vital innovations that ended up treating COVID‐19 even though they were originated to treat other diseases (more or less distant from the COVID‐19 domain), as the antiviral drug Remdesivir and the antirheumatoid arthritis drug Tocilizumab. Results reveal that technological exaptation, especially if characterized by a longer exaptive distance, is a potential driving force of innovation to cope with COVID‐19 in the short‐term and other similar issues. On this basis, we provide propositions for a more general crisis model of innovation. This study adds a new perspective that may be helpful to explain the evolution of innovation in the presence of crises, considering technological exaptation in a context of environmental threats.","Ardito, Lorenzo; Coccia, Mario; Messeni Petruzzelli, Antonio",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8013845/,476
51942,P35 Co-producing surgical patient information during COVID-19,2021-04-08,"Increasing evidence indicates that pyroptosis, a new type of programmed cell death, may participate in random flap necrosis and play an important role. ROS-induced lysosome malfunction is an important inducement of pyroptosis. Transcription factor E3 (TFE3) exerts a decisive effect in oxidative metabolism and lysosomal homeostasis. We explored the effect of pyroptosis in random flap necrosis and discussed the effect of TFE3 in modulating pyroptosis. Histological analysis via hematoxylin-eosin staining, immunohistochemistry, general evaluation of flaps, evaluation of tissue edema, and laser Doppler blood flow were employed to determine the survival of the skin flaps. Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to calculate the expressions of pyroptosis, oxidative stress, lysosome function, and the AMPK-MCOLN1 signaling pathway. In cell experiments, HUVEC cells were utilized to ensure the relationship between TFE3, reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced lysosome malfunction and cell pyroptosis. Our results indicate that pyroptosis exists in the random skin flap model and oxygen and glucose deprivation/reperfusion cell model. In addition, NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis leads to necrosis of the flaps. Moreover, we also found that ischemic flaps can augment the accumulation of ROS, thereby inducing lysosomal malfunction and finally initiating pyroptosis. Meanwhile, we observed that TFE3 levels are interrelated with ROS levels, and overexpression and low expression of TFE3 levels can, respectively, inhibit and promote ROS-induced lysosomal dysfunction and pyroptosis during in vivo and in vitro experiments. In conclusion, we found the activation of TFE3 in random flaps is partially regulated by the AMPK-MCOLN1 signal pathway. Taken together, TFE3 is a key regulator of ROS-induced pyroptosis in random skin flaps, and TFE3 may be a promising therapeutic target for improving random flap survival.","Li, Jiafeng; Lou, Junsheng; Yu, Gaoxiang; Chen, Yijie; Chen, Ruiheng; Chen, Zhuliu; Wu, Chenyu; Ding, Jian; Xu, Yu; Jiang, Jingtao; Xu, Huazi; Zhu, Xuwei; Gao, Weiyang; Zhou, Kailiang",Front Cell Dev Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8060706/,476

The non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease (NDD-CKD) patient who is at risk of, or may already be suffering from, a number of the associated complications of CKD, represents an ideal patient group for the development of such initiatives. The current COVID-19 pandemic, and drive towards shielding vulnerable individuals, has further highlighted the need for home testing pathways. In this narrative review we outline the evidence supporting remote patient management and the various technologies in use in the POCT setting. We then review the devices currently available for use in the home by patients in five key areas of renal medicine: anaemia, biochemical, blood pressure, anticoagulation and diabetes monitoring. Currently there are few devices and little evidence to support the use of home POCT in CKD; while home testing in blood pressure, anticoagulation and diabetes monitoring are relatively well developed, the fields of anaemia and biochemical POCT are still in their infancy. However, patients’ attitudes towards eHealth and home POCT are consistently positive and physicians also find this care highly acceptable. The regulatory and translational challenges involved in the development of new home based care pathways are significant. Pragmatic and adaptable trials of a hybrid effectiveness-implementation design, as well as continued technological POCT device advancement, are required to deliver these innovative new pathways that our patients desire and deserve.","Bodington, Richard; Kassianides, Xenophon; Bhandari, Sunil",Clin Kidney J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8083235/,476

As a result, a few clubs were administratively excluded from the highest junior competition. Three of the five excluded clubs decided to initiate arbitration proceedings. After the failure of arbitration, the clubs filed a lawsuit in the Czech civil court seeking the annulment of the decision of the CIHA to expel them from the competition. This article analyses the actions of CIHA from the perspective of EU competition law. It assesses whether the CIHA’s exclusion of clubs from the new league may violate Articles 101 or 102 TFEU. For this purpose, the article uses the methodological approach adopted by the Court in Meca-Medina. Although in general, in accordance with EU law and EU law policy, the organization of competitions and the setting of sporting rules fall within the competence of sports associations, these competences are not unlimited. Sports rules have to be set up in advance based on the transparent process of sports governing body in accordance with good governance principles. If the procedure of adopting sporting rules is not in accordance with the principles of good governance, it cannot be considered inherent and proportionate and as such it may be found contrary to the Article 101 or 102 TFEU.","Glos, Pavel; Stehlík, Václav",Int Sports Law J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8093593/,476

The pandemic can be seen as a ‘wicked problem’ defined by high complexity, uncertainty and contested social values requiring a transdisciplinary approach formulating social policy. This article argues that a ‘Critical STEM Literacy’ is required to engage sufficiently with STEM knowledge and how science operates and informs personal health decisions. STEM literacy is necessary to critique government social policy decisions that set rules for behaviour to limit the spread of COVID-19. Ideas of scientific, mathematical and critical literacy are discussed before reviewing some current knowledge of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to aid interpretation of the examples provided. The article draws on experience of the pandemic in the United Kingdom (UK), particularly mathematical modelling used to calculate the reproductive rate (R) of COVID-19, communication of mortality and case data using graphs and the mitigation strategies of social distancing and mask wearing. In all these examples, there is an interaction of STEM with a political milieu that often misrepresents science as activity to generate one dependable truth, rather than through careful empirical validation of new knowledge. Critical STEM literacy thus requires appreciation of the social practices of science such as peer review and assessment of bias. Implications of the pandemic for STEM education in schools requiring critical thinking and in understanding disease epidemiology in a global context are discussed.","Braund, Martin",Can,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8106518/,476

55067,Do Stealth Adapted Viruses Predispose to More Severe and Prolonged Covid‐19 Illness?,2021-05-14,"Regular exercise is associated with pronounced health benefits. The molecular processes involved in physiological adaptations to exercise are best understood in skeletal muscle. Enhanced mitochondrial functions in muscle are central to exercise-induced adaptations. However, regular exercise also benefits the brain and is a major protective factor against neurodegenerative diseases, such as the most common age-related form of dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, or the most common neurodegenerative motor disorder, Parkinson’s disease. While there is evidence that exercise induces signalling from skeletal muscle to the brain, the mechanistic understanding of the crosstalk along the muscle–brain axis is incompletely understood. Mitochondria in both organs, however, seem to be central players. Here, we provide an overview on the central role of mitochondria in exercise-induced communication routes from muscle to the brain. These routes include circulating factors, such as myokines, the release of which often depends on mitochondria, and possibly direct mitochondrial transfer. On this basis, we examine the reported effects of different modes of exercise on mitochondrial features and highlight their expected benefits with regard to neurodegeneration prevention or mitigation. In addition, knowledge gaps in our current understanding related to the muscle–brain axis in neurodegenerative diseases are outlined.","Burtscher, Johannes; Millet, Grégoire P.; Place, Nicolas; Kayser, Bengt; Zanou, Nadège",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8235687/,476

55214,Impact of Covid‐19 on the convergence of GDP per capita in OECD countries,2021-06-08,"Infection with the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus can lead to variable clinical outcomes. Approximately 40% of those infected will remain asymptomatic; with a similar percentage developing a mild to moderate illness, essentially localized to the respiratory system. A markedly more severe and extensive illness involving multiple organs occurs in the remaining approximately 20% of those infected. A further intriguing consequence of Covid‐19 disease is the continuing illness in about 10% of those with either the mild to moderate or the more severe acute Covid‐19 disease. This Long Covid‐19 syndrome has many features in common with the chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). The concept of coinfecting virus pathogens is central to understanding several human diseases. Another useful concept is that of stealth adapted viruses. These viruses differ from the viruses from which they are derived in not typically evoking inflammation. This is because of deletion or mutation of the genes coding for the relatively few virus components that are normally targeted by the cellular immune system. It is a generic process that can potentially apply to all viruses, including the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus. Stealth adaptation has occurred with the cytomegaloviruses of rhesus and African green monkeys. Kidney cells from African green monkeys are still being used to produce poliovirus vaccines. DNA sequencing studies on these monkey‐derived stealth adapted viruses show that in addition to deletions or mutations of some of the originating virus genes, stealth adaptation can involve the incorporation of additional genetic sequences from cells, other viruses, and bacteria. These “renegade” sequences become components within the reformed, replicating and infectious stealth adapted viruses. The variable and diverse genetic compositions of different stealth adapted viruses are likely to at least occasionally include some elements that are interactive with genes of the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus. This could lead to the potentiation of either or both viruses with added pathogenicity for the infected individual. Moreover, although the residual virus components may not be ordinarily immunogenic, some may become so if the virus levels are greatly increased and/or the immune system is sufficiently stimulated. A strong case can be made for a role of stealth adapted viruses in patients with the Long Covid‐19 syndrome. These patients can be divided into those who had similar but milder symptoms prior to Covid‐19 and those who had previously been asymptomatic. The former patients were probably infected earlier with a stealth adapted virus, which has now become potentiated through its interaction with the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus. The later patients are likely to be newly infected with a stealth adapted SARS‐CoV‐2 virus. The next step in exploring this hypothesis is to culture the blood of patients for evidence of infection with stealth adapted viruses, followed by genetic sequencing of the positive cultures. The testing should include patients who have experienced severe acute Covid‐19 illness and patients with the Long Covid‐19 syndrome. Identifying severe acute Covid‐19 illness as a co‐infection and the realization that the Long Covid‐19 syndrome is also an infectious and transmissible disease will have important Public Health implications with regards to an expanding spectrum of human illnesses.","Martin, W.

We develop the foreign exposure indicators such as original sin and currency mismatches using a novel data set. Our computations suggest that Latin American economies suffer from the original sin problem, followed by Central European countries. We find a higher degree of currency mismatches in Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Indonesia, Poland, Mexico, and Turkey. The resurgence of currency mismatches and the Covid-19 pandemic is a stress test for monetary policy frameworks. We find that country’s size, inflation volatility, and exchange rate depreciation cause currency mismatches. We show that the currency mismatch and original sin problem are lower in countries following de-dollarization policies such as limiting debt exposure, effective monetary and fiscal policies, better institutional quality, and export openness. The EMEs need to adopt policies to control currency mismatches, which are consistent with their growth-oriented policies. We suggest the independence of monetary policy, the implementation of macroprudential policies, and the development of offshore bond markets in a local currency. These policies control currency mismatches without changing the growth orientation of the EMEs. South Africa, Hungary, and Asian economies hold lessons for EMEs in controlling currency mismatches.","Venkatesh, Hari; Hiremath, Gourishankar S.",Int Econ Econ Policy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8243064/,476

However, we observed that when temperature of the rats’ lens was maintained at a lower temperature for a prolonged time, the opacification of lens was only partly reversible. To review the potential molecular mechanism of the irreversible part of opacification under cold stimulation, we applied comparative transcriptomic and proteomic analysis to systematically investigate the molecular changes that occurred in the lens capsules of rats under low temperature treatments. The RNA sequencing based transcriptomic analysis showed a significant up-regulation of genes related to the lens structure and development in the Hypothermia Group. Hub genes were small heat shock proteins (sHSPs). Besides the same findings as the transcriptomic results, the liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry based proteomic analysis also revealed the up-regulation of the apoptotic process. To further analyze the regulatory mechanism in this process, we subsequently performed integrated analysis and identified the down-regulation of Notch3/Hes1 and PI3K/Akt/Xiap signaling axis. Our research revealed the activation of the apoptotic process in rats’ lens under cold stimulation, and the sHSP related heat shock response as a potential protective factor through our transcriptomic and proteomic data.","Zhou, Jiayue; Wu, Jing; Zheng, Sifan; Chen, Xiangjun; Zhou, Daizhan; Shentu, Xingchao",Front Physiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8247577/,476

Building on existing comparative research, this article focuses on civic education in English secondary schools and, in particular, the ability of related interventions to close participation gaps normally seen by sex, ethnicity and socio-economic status. Analysing original survey data collected from more than 350 students in 17 maintained secondary schools located in six regions of England, this article evaluates the impact of four types of civic education (curricula lessons; open classroom climate; participatory activities; and political contact) on three participatory outcomes (expressive political behaviours; voting intentions; and anticipated high-intensity participation). Descriptive and inferential analyses suggest (a) cumulative quantities of civic education are positively associated with youth political participation; (b) open classroom climate may close known inequalities in young people’s expressive and electoral participation whilst political contact with politicians and political institutions may widen those inequalities; and (c) civic education may currently accelerate inequalities in young people’s political ambition. These findings raise important and immediate challenges for policy-makers who are concerned with improving young people’s civic engagement in England and elsewhere.

The later stage of HNC diagnosis significantly affects the patient’s survival rate. This makes it mandatory to diagnose this cancer with a suitable biomarker and imaging techniques at the earlier stages of growth. There are limitations to traditional technologies for early detection of HNC. Furthermore, the use of nanocarriers for delivering chemo-, radio-, and phototherapeutic drugs represents a promising approach for improving the outcome of HNC treatments. Several studies with nanostructures focus on the development of a targeted and sustained release of anticancer molecules with reduced side effects. Besides, nanovehicles could allow co-delivering of anticancer drugs for synergistic activity to counteract chemo- or radioresistance. Additionally, a new generation of smart nanomaterials with stimuli-responsive properties have been developed to distinguish between unique tumor conditions and healthy tissue. In this light, the present article reviews the mechanisms used by different nanostructures (metallic and metal oxide nanoparticles, polymeric nanoparticles, quantum dots, liposomes, nanomicelles, etc.) to improve cancer diagnosis and treatment, provides an up-to-date picture of the state of the art in this field, and highlights the major challenges for future improvements.","Ruiz-Pulido, Gustavo; Medina, Dora I.; Barani, Mahmood; Rahdar, Abbas; Sargazi, Ghasem; Baino, Francesco; Pandey, Sadanand",Materials (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8269895/,476
56546,COVID-19 and Changes in Healthcare in North America,2021-07-13,"The popularity of traditional fermented food products is based on their healthiness. The addition of a starter brings consistent, desirable, and predictable food changes with improved nutritive, functional, and sensory qualities. The addition of a mixture of plant residues as a starter or source of microbes is an age-old practice to prepare traditional fermented food and beverages, and most of the reported data on traditional foods were based on the analysis of the final product. The contribution of an individual starter component (plant residue) is not experimentally substantiated for any traditional fermented food, but this data are very essential for the formulation of an effective starter. In this study, Asparagus racemosus, which used as a common ingredient of starter for preparation of rice fermented food in the Indian sub-continent, was used as a starter for the preparation of rice fermented food under laboratory scale, and its microbial and nutrient profile was evaluated. The fermented product was a good source of lactic acid bacteria, Bifidobacterium sp., yeast, etc. The food product was acidic and enriched with lactic acid and acetic acid with titratable acidity of 0.65%. The content of protein, fat, minerals, and vitamins (water-soluble) was considerably improved. Most notably, oligosaccharide (G3-matotriose), unsaturated fatty acids (ω3, ω6, ω7, and ω9), and a pool of essential and non-essential amino acids were enriched in the newly formulated food. Thus, the herbal starter-based rice fermented food would provide important macro- and micronutrients. They could also deliver large numbers of active microorganisms for the sustainability of health. Therefore, the selected plant part conferred its suitability as an effective starter for the preparation of healthier rice-based food products.

The mixed approach is used as the modified Total Interpretive Structure Model organizes the binary interactions among the challenges, while Cross-Impact Matrix Multiplication Applied to Classification analysis organizes specific precise assessments of the driving power and dependence of the challenges. The results of the study reflect that (i) lack of supplier commitment to sustainable products and (ii) lack of knowledge toward sustainability in value chains are the challenges that achieved the highest driving power. The challenge ‘inadequate communication among the suppliers in the value chain’ is at the highest level in the analysis.

An integrative graph-theoretic network-based drug repurposing methodology quantifying the interplay of key gene regulations and protein–protein interactions in muscle atrophy conditions is presented. Transcriptomic datasets from mice in spaceflight from GeneLab have been extensively mined to extract the key genes that cause muscle atrophy in organ muscle tissues such as the thymus, liver, and spleen. Top muscle atrophy gene regulators are selected by Bayesian Markov blanket method and gene–disease knowledge graph is constructed using the scalable precision medicine knowledge engine. A deep graph neural network is trained for predicting links in the network. The top ranked diseases are identified and drugs are selected for repurposing using drug bank resource. A disease drug knowledge graph is constructed and the graph neural network is trained for predicting new drugs. The results are compared with machine learning methods such as random forest, and gradient boosting classifiers. Network measure based methods shows that preferential attachment has good performance for link prediction in both the gene–disease and disease–drug graphs. The receiver operating characteristic curves, and prediction accuracies for each method show that the random walk similarity measure and deep graph neural network outperforms the other methods. Several key target genes identified by the graph neural network are associated with diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and neural disorders.

Objective: To evaluate the prevalence and trends of IV ribavirin use among reproductive-age population in 2010–2017. Methods: The study design of our study is retrospective cross-sectional study based on healthcare database. We identified and extracted the data of residents aged 18–44 years by using Yinzhou healthcare information database at 21 January, 2018. A cohort of IV ribavirin users were identified through outpatient prescription records in 3 general hospitals and 24 community health centers from 2010 to 2017. We reported the number, proportion, and prevalence of the exposure to IV ribavirin stratified by sex, age, marital status, education level, occupation, hospital level, calendar year, diagnosis, and dosage. The overall trends of IV ribavirin use, and the trends in different levels of hospital and common diagnoses were further analyzed and described. Result: During the study period, the prevalence of IV ribavirin use among reproductive-age adults was 6.02% (48,287/801,667). Relatively higher prevalence were found in adults aged 40–44 (8.04%, 95% CI: 7.90–8.17), unmarried patients (8.91%, 95% CI: 8.74–9.08), and who had more than 9 years of education (6.82%, 95% CI: 6.74–6.90). Compared to secondary and tertiary hospitals, IV ribavirin was more likely to be dispensed in primary hospitals (19.44%, 95% CI: 19.28–19.61). The most common diagnoses were acute upper respiratory infections (AURIs), accounting for 80% of the patients exposed to IV ribavirin. For patients with AURIs, the prevalence of IV ribavirin was nearly 30%. Overall, the prevalence of IV ribavirin use decreased from 1.72% in 2010 to 0.24% in 2017. Conclusion: We found IV ribavirin was mainly used for AURIs which suggested that a large amount of IV ribavirin use was probably inappropriate. The prevalence was decreasing by 87% over the past 8 years, and we encourage clinicians and pharmacists to continually avoid inappropriate use of IV ribavirin.","Li, Hailong; Zhao, Houyu; Lin, Hongbo; Shen, Peng; Liu, Cuili; Zhan, Siyan",Front Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8484711/,476

Even though treatment options for HCC are constantly improving, preventive measures must not be neglected. CONCLUSION: The vaccination against hepatitis B has proven effective in preventing infection with HBV. As shown more than 20 years ago in Taiwan, vaccination programs lower not only the prevalence of HBsAg carriers but also decrease the incidence of HCC. By achieving immunity against HBV, the infection with hepatitis D virus can also be prevented. This is important in the light of HCC prevention as HBV/HDV coinfection is known to drastically increase the risk of HCC. New approaches aim for the development of therapeutic HBV vaccines ideally curing chronic infections. Beside the prevention of infections, it is pivotal to detect existing infections. This helps to minimize the HCC risk by initiating treatment in those who need it.","Dietz, Christopher A.; Wedemeyer, Heiner",Onkologe (Berl),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8511853/,476

It makes the manufacturing plant adaptable to changes, makes it productive by manufacturing products that are currently in demand, prevents the dissolution of the plant and thus harvests the maximum potential of the manufacturing plant in the need of an emergency. However, not many industries and plants are suited to make the appropriate changes and lack knowledge on how to proceed to do so. The paper identifies the barriers that are faced in the transition for repurposing a general manufacturing plant to a more suited plant for current emergencies that need rapid response. These barriers hinder the repurposing of the manufacturing plant and impact the business decisions to establish a manufacturing plant suited for emergency situations. Surveys and information from various experts in this field are used to identify these barriers and document their interdependencies and influence on one another. The data is graphed and analysed utilizing TISM (Total Interpretive Structural Modelling) and MICMAC (Cross-Impact Matrix Multiplication Applied to Classification) methodology to further examine by classifying and ranking the relationships. Analysing the relationships between barriers leads to effective decisions towards the successful adoption of repurposing of manufacturing plant. A contextual relationship based structural table called interpretive table and structural model is made to pinpoint influential barriers. Thus, the research explains and explores significant barriers to the adoption of repurposing in manufacturing plant and not only provides a strong methodological and contextual contribution with the help of TISM and MICMAC but also gives research a sense of links of the barriers across various levels. On a practical level, the study is immensely useful to help manufacturing plants overcome repercussions due to disruptions by modifying existing practice and business model to a new model which synchronizes with the new normal to increase the efficiency and survivability of the plant. The result of the research points out that strategical, cultural, technological, and innovation barriers are the most influential barrier in repurposing of manufacturing plant.","Poduval, Aadarsh; Ayyagari, Maruti Sriram; Malinda, Mohit; K.E.K, Vimal; Kumar, Anil; Kandasamy, Jayakrishna",Oper Manag Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8513569/,476

Changes in weight, HbA1c, cardiovascular risk factors (UKPDS risk engine), and self-reported health status (the 36-Item Short-Form [SF-36] survey, Impact of Weight on Quality of Life [IWQOL] instrument, and Problem Areas in Diabetes Survey [PAID]) were assessed. RESULTS After 3 years, the RYGB group had greater weight loss (mean -24.9 kg [95% CI -29.5, -20.4] vs. -5.2 [-10.3, -0.2]; P < 0.001) and lowering of HbA1c (-1.79% [-2.38, -1.20] vs. -0.39% [-1.06, 0.28] [-19.6 mmol/mol {95% CI -26.0, -13.1} vs. -4.3 {-11.6, 3.1}]; P < 0.001) compared with the IMWM group. Changes in cardiometabolic risk for coronary heart disease and stroke were all more favorable in RYGB versus IMWM (P < 0.05 to P < 0.01). IWQOL improved more after RYGB (P < 0.001), primarily due to subscales of physical function, self-esteem, and work performance. SF-36 and PAID scores improved in both groups, with no difference between treatments. A structural equation model demonstrated that improvement in overall quality of life was more strongly associated with weight loss than with improved HbA1c and was manifest by greater improvements in IWQOL than with either SF-36 or PAID.

The results showed that the combination of DBD with Fe2-Mn1/AC system had the highest effect, and the degradation efficiency of TCH could reach 98.8 % after 15 min treatment, which was 25.5 % higher than that of DBD-only. With the increase of discharge voltage and catalyst dosage, the degradation efficiency of TCH promoted. And initial pH had little effect on the degradation of TCH. In the combined system, the Fe2-Mn1/AC catalyst could retain an excellent stability and reusability. The addition of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) showed that ·OH participated in the TCH degradation. The generated O3 might be catalyzed by Fe-Mn/AC catalyst to produce more ·OH. And more H2O2 was produced in DBD-only system than that in DBD-catalytic system. Nine main degradation intermediate products in the combined system were detected by HPLC-MS, and three possible degradation pathways were proposed.","Cheng, Jian; Xie, Yirui; Wei, Ying; Xie, Dongrun; Sun, Wenbo; Zhang, Ying; Li, Menghong; An, Jiutao",Chemosphere,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.131841; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399261/,476

A further limitation refers to the fact that only few data were analyzed taking into account the possible effects of gender. The purpose of this study was to estimate the association between SUA and arterial stiffness in general population and hypertensive patients, as a whole population and as divided by gender, by pooling results from existing studies.Materials and methods: Carotid-femoral and brachial-ankle PWV (cf- and ba-PWV) have been analyzed separately and subgroup analyses by gender are reported. Among 692 potentially relevant works, 24 articles were analyzed.Results: Seven studies referred to cf-PWV in the general population with an overall positive association at adjusted analysis for both males and females (beta regression coefficient (ß): 0.07; 95%CI: 0.03; 0.11 and ß: 0.06; 95%CI: 0.03; 0.09, respectively). Twelve studies referred to ba-PWV in the general population with the finding of a positive association at adjusted analysis for females (ß: 0.04; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.01;0.07), but not for males (ß: 0.13; 95%CI: -0.09; 0.34). In hypertensive patients only four studies evaluated cf-PWV and one ba-PWV with only one study (with cf-PWV) finding positive association.Conclusion: The association between SUA and cf-PWV resulted significant in general population in both males and females while it was only significant for female regarding ba-PWV. Furthermore, the few available studies found no significant relationship between SUA and both cf- and ba-PWV in hypertensive subjects.","Rebora, Paola; Andreano, Anita; Triglione, Nicola; Piccinelli, Enrico; Palazzini, Matteo; Occhi, Lucia; Grassi, Guido; Valsecchi, Maria Grazia; Giannattasio, Cristina; Maloberti, Alessandro",Blood pressure,https://doi.org/10.1080/08037051.2020.1735929; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32138547/,476
63139,"Leveraging the power of mutual aid, coalitions, leadership, and advocacy during COVID-19.",2020-06-25,"Endosymbiosis is found in all types of ecosystems and it can be sensitive to environmental changes due to the intimate interaction between the endosymbiont and the host. Indeed, global climate change disturbs the local ambient environment and threatens endosymbiotic species, and in some cases leads to local ecosystem collapse. Recent studies have revealed that the endosymbiont can affect holobiont (endosymbiont and host together) stress tolerance as much as the host does, and manipulation of the microbial partners in holobionts may mitigate the impacts of the environmental stress. Here, we first show how the endosymbiont presence affects holobiont stress tolerance by discussing three well-studied endosymbiotic systems, which include plant-fungi, aquatic organism-algae, and insect-bacteria systems. We then review how holobionts are able to alter their stress tolerance via associated endosymbionts by changing their endosymbiont composition, by adaptation of their endosymbionts, or by acclimation of their endosymbionts. Finally, we discuss how different transmission modes (vertical or horizontal transmission) might affect the adaptability of holobionts. We propose that the endosymbiont is a good target for modifying holobiont stress tolerance, which makes it critical to more fully investigate the role of endosymbionts in the adaptive responses of holobionts to stress.","Ye, Siao; Siemann, Evan",Results and problems in cell differentiation,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-51849-3_21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33263887/,476

We propose an easy online estimation procedure for the case fatality rate, ie, the proportion of deaths among the total cases during the course of an epidemic disease, which is an important indicator of the severity of a disease. The key step in our procedure is representing the data with the run-off triangle, which simultaneously takes into account two time axes, namely, the calendar and disease-duration times. We restructure the original data into run-off triangle data, where the cells contain the numbers of cured patients, deceased patients, and patients still having the disease at a given combination of calendar and disease-duration times. Based on the restructured run-off triangle data, we propose an online estimator of the case fatality rate. We numerically show the advantages of the proposed estimator compared to the existing estimators in the literature. Finally, we apply our procedure to the 2015 Korean Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak data.","Lee, Sungim; Lim, Johan",Statistics in medicine,https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.8125; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30835857/,476

We synthesized a panel of contiguous cDNAs that spanned the entire genome. Following contig assembly into genome-length cDNA, transfected full-length transcripts recovered several recombinant viruses (rMERS-CoV) that contained the expected marker mutations inserted into the component clones. Because the wild-type MERS-CoV contains a tissue culture-adapted T1015N mutation in the S glycoprotein, rMERS-CoV replicated ~0.5 log less efficiently than wild-type virus. In addition, we ablated expression of the accessory protein ORF5 (rMERS•ORF5) and replaced it with tomato red fluorescent protein (rMERS-RFP) or deleted the entire ORF3, 4, and 5 accessory cluster (rMERS-ΔORF3-5). Recombinant rMERS-CoV, rMERS-CoV•ORF5, and MERS-CoV-RFP replicated to high titers, whereas MERS-ΔORF3-5 showed 1-1.5 logs reduced titer compared with rMERS-CoV. Northern blot analyses confirmed the associated molecular changes in the recombinant viruses, and sequence analysis demonstrated that RFP was expressed from the appropriate consensus sequence AACGAA. We further show dipeptidyl peptidase 4 expression, MERS-CoV replication, and RNA and protein synthesis in human airway epithelial cell cultures, primary lung fibroblasts, primary lung microvascular endothelial cells, and primary alveolar type II pneumocytes, demonstrating a much broader tissue tropism than severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.

The evidence base for this novel medication is largely based on one pivotal phase III trial which was stopped early due to significant clinical benefits being shown. However potential limitations in the trial design have been highlighted in recent medical literature, necessitating a thorough review of the evidence base for sacubitril/valsartan. Methods: This review will be conducted using the PRISMA reporting guidelines. Relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for sacubitril/valsartan will be systematically searched for in Medline (PubMed), Embase, Cochrane library, Google Scholar, Web of Science, Toxline and Scopus. Clinical trials registries will be searched, as will eight grey literature databases. In addition, unpublished clinical study reports (CSRs) of relevant trials will be requested from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the Clinical Study Data Request database. Studies will be included if they involve randomising adult patients with heart failure to either sacubitril/valsartan or usual care with either an active comparator or placebo as a control. All relevant clinical and safety outcomes will be reviewed, particularly hospitalisation due to heart failure and cardiovascular mortality. Two reviewers will assess eligibility of selected trials for inclusion. Data extraction will be performed separately for trial publications, clinical trial registries and for CSRs using a piloted form. Methodological quality of included trials from published sources will be assessed separately using the recently updated Cochrane Risk of Bias tool version 2. Narrative synthesis of included studies will be conducted and, if appropriate, meta-analysis for clinical efficacy and safety outcomes.

63986,Neurorehabilitation in the times of Covid-19: insights from the Spanish Neurorehabilitation Society (SENR).,2020-10-26,"BACKGROUND Our lab has previously found that structural integrity in tracts from the raphe nucleus (RN) to the amygdala, measured by fractional anisotropy (FA), predicts remission to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in major depressive disorder (MDD). This could potentially serve as a biomarker for remission that can guide clinical decision-making. To enhance repeatability and reproducibility, we replicated our study in a larger, more representative multi-site sample. METHODS 64 direction DTI was collected in 144 medication-free patients with MDD from the Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response for Clinical Care (EMBARC) study. We performed probabilistic tractography between the RN and bilateral amygdala and hippocampus and calculated weighted FA in these tracts. Patients were treated with either sertraline or placebo, and their change in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) score reported. Pretreatment weighted FA was compared between remitters and nonremitters, and correlation between FA and percent change in HDRS score was assessed. Exploratory moderator and voxel analyses were also performed. RESULTS Contrary to our hypotheses, FA was greater in nonremitters than in remitters in RN-left and right amygdala tracts (p = 0.02 and 0.01, respectively). Pretreatment FA between the raphe and left amygdala correlated with greater, not reduced, HDRS (r = 0.18, p = 0.04). This finding was found to be greater in the placebo group. Moderator and voxel analyses yielded no significant findings. CONCLUSIONS We found greater FA in nonremitters between the RN and amygdala than in remitters, and a correlation between FA and symptom worsening, particularly with placebo. These findings may help reveal more about the nature of MDD, as well as guide research methods involving placebo response.","Pillai, Rajapillai L I; Huang, Chuan; LaBella, Andrew; Zhang, Mengru; Yang, Jie; Trivedi, Madhukar; Weissman, Myrna; McGrath, Patrick; Fava, Maurizio; Kurian, Benji; Cooper, Crystal; McInnis, Melvin; Oquendo, Maria A; Pizzagalli, Diego A; Parsey, Ramin V; DeLorenzo, Christine",Journal of affective disorders,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2019.05.055; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31158720/,476
64336,"COVID-19 in Clinicians-More Cases in Women, More Deaths in Men.",2021-04-20,"BACKGROUND In developmental and reproductive toxicity studies, analysis of litter-based binary endpoints (e.g., incidence of malformed fetuses) is complex in that littermates often are not entirely independent of one another. It is well established that the litter, not the individual fetus, is the proper independent experimental unit in statistical analysis. Accordingly, analysis is often based on the proportion affected per litter and the litter proportions are analyzed as continuous data. Because these proportional data generally do not meet assumptions of symmetry or normality, data are typically analyzed by nonparametric methods, arcsine square root transformation, or logit transformation. METHODS We conducted power calculations to compare different approaches (nonparametric, arcsine square root-transformed, logit-transformed, untransformed) for analyzing litter-based proportional data. A reproductive toxicity study with a control and one treated group provided data for two endpoints: prenatal loss, and fertility by in utero insemination (IUI). Type 1 error and power were estimated by 10,000 simulations based on two-sample one-tailed t tests with varying numbers of litters per group. To further compare the different approaches, we conducted additional analyses with shifted mean proportions to produce illustrative scenarios. RESULTS Analyses based on logit-transformed proportions had greater power than those based on untransformed or arcsine square root-transformed proportions, or nonparametric procedures. CONCLUSION The logit transformation is preferred to the other approaches considered when making inferences concerning litter-based proportional endpoints, particularly with skewed distributions. The improved performance of the logit transformation becomes increasingly pronounced as the response proportions are increasingly close to the boundaries of the parameter space.","Feder, Paul I; Aume, Laura L; Triplett, Cheryl A; Simmons, Jane Ellen; Narotsky, Michael G",Birth defects research,https://doi.org/10.1002/bdr2.1755; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32735073/,476

This dataset included insurance claim data before and during COVID-19 treatment and clinical outcomes. Claim data related to skin diseases and relevant biologics were analysed to figure out the association of COVID-19 with skin diseases and relevant biologics.

However, the noninferiority of DMT in the general population (including drip and ship mode) is controversial, and the impact of thrombolysis on retrieval attempts remains uncertain. This was a post-hoc analysis of a multi-center, prospective enrolled study. Patients were divided into the BMT group and the DMT group. Baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes were compared by using univariate analysis, multivariable analysis, and propensity score matching analysis, respectively. Of all 245 patients enrolled in this study, 79 (32.2%) patients underwent BMT. In the multivariable analysis, the ratio of excellent prognosis (defined as modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score 0-1 at 90 days) was significantly higher in the BMT group compared with the DMT group (odds ratio, 2.731; 95% confidence interval, 1.238-6.023; P = 0.013). The ratio of good prognosis (mRS score 0-2 at 90 days), successful recanalization rate [modified Thrombolysis In Cerebral Ischemia (mTICI) score 2b-3] and mortality rate were similar between the two groups. The excellent prognosis rate was significantly higher in the BMT group after propensity score matching (P = 0.023). BMT was associated with a higher ratio of excellent prognosis (mRS 0-1) and a similar successful recanalization rate without increasing peri-operation complications compared with DMT in AIS-LVO patients.

This study aims to examine the psychometric properties of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) in Turkish people and to determine the level of fear of COVID-19 among Turkish people. METHODS The research was carried out between March and April 2020. A Personal Information Form and the FCV-19S were used to collect the research data. In the validity and reliability stage, 84 people were contacted randomly for data collection. After the validity and reliability analyses of the scale, a total of 431 Turkish people volunteered to participate in the study and answered the questions in the online questionnaire form using a convenience and snowball sampling method. Confirmatory factor analysis, item-total correlation and Cronbach's alpha coefficient were calculated for psychometric evaluation. Bivariate analysis was applied to determine the level of fear of COVID-19. RESULTS Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.89, which is stated to have high reliability. FCV-19S scores of participants were determined to be 21.47 ± 6.28. FCV-19S scores of females were determined as 20.48 ± 6.33 and FCV-19S scores of males were determined as 19.78 ± 7.34 according to the bivariate analysis (p < .05). Age, marital status, having children and living alone or with others, tobacco use and anxiety about going to the hospital during the pandemic did not affect on fear of COVID-19 (p > .05). Particularly being female, the presence of chronic disease requiring long-term medication and rarely taking protective measures recommended by the Ministry of Health and having a chronic disease had a significant effect on higher levels of fear of COVID-19 (p < .05).

As this disease continues to spread worldwide, it has posed enormous challenges on the healthcare of several diseases, especially cancer, because hospital facilities have invested health resources for patients with COVID-19. Indeed, patients with lung cancer are particularly vulnerable because of their poor baseline lung function and cancer-related treatment. In addition, once infected, they are at an increased risk of pulmonary complications from COVID-19. Oncologists are thus facing a challenge as how to balance the treatment plans to control the disease while protecting the patients with lung cancer from COVID-19. In fact, it is crucial to provide individualized treatment recommendations to limit the risks during these difficult times. This review highlights the key challenges that oncologists face when diagnosing COVID-19 among patients with lung cancer and examines the current recommendations from available literature, clinical expertise, and expert opinions regarding managing lung cancer in the era of COVID-19.

We aimed to determine the association of early PHE and clinical outcome among participants of the Intensive Blood Pressure Reduction in Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage Trial (INTERACT) studies. METHODS Pooled analyses of computed tomographic substudies in the pilot phase (INTERACT1) and main phase (INTERACT2), both international, prospective, open, blinded end point, randomized controlled trials, of patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (<6 hours) and elevated systolic blood pressure, randomly assigned to intensive (target systolic blood pressure, <140 mm Hg) or guideline-based (systolic blood pressure, <180 mm Hg) blood-pressure management. Substudy participants (n=1310; 346 INTERACT1, 964 INTERACT2) had blinded central analyses of digital images from standardized baseline and 24-hour computed tomography. Predictors of death or dependency (modified Rankin scale scores, ≥3) at 90 days were assessed in logistic regression models and reported with odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. INTERACT studies are registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00226096 and NCT00716079). RESULTS Of 1138 (87%) patients with 2 CTs available for edema analysis and outcome information, time from intracerebral hemorrhage onset to baseline computed tomography, baseline hematoma volume, 24-hour hematoma growth, and intraventricular extension were independent predictors of 24-hour PHE growth. Absolute growth in PHE volume was significantly associated with death or dependency (adjusted odds ratio, 1.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.33 per 5 mL increase from baseline; P=0.025) at 90 days after adjustment for demographic, clinical, and hematoma parameter prognostic factors. Associations were consistent across various sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION PHE growth is an independent prognostic factor in intracerebral hemorrhage.

In this work, the mechanism of electron delivery was confirmed experimentally by both measuring currents through ice and monitoring photodissociated OH radicals on ice by using a novel method. The surface OH radicals significantly decrease upon the appearance of negative current flow, indicating that the electrons are delivered by proton-hole (OH-) transfer in ice triggered by OH- production on the surface. The mechanism of proton-hole transfer was rationalized by density functional theory calculations.","Kitajima, Kensei; Nakai, Yoichi; Sameera, W M C; Tsuge, Masashi; Miyazaki, Ayane; Hidaka, Hiroshi; Kouchi, Akira; Watanabe, Naoki",The journal of physical chemistry letters,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.0c03345; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33400539/,476

RECENT FINDINGS A number of new mutated genes have been recently detected being associated with LVHT. There are indications that microtubules changing cell polarity, the transcription factor Nkx2-5, and NOTCH-1 signaling are involved in the pathogenesis of LVHT. There are also indications that the PKC signaling pathway, which is involved in the regulation of gap junction intercellular communication, is disturbed in LVHT. LVHT is the same as LVNC and is associated with pathogenic variants in > 110 mtDNA or nDNA genes. LVHT has been also reported in > 15 chromosomal defects. However, a causal relation between any of these variants and LVHT has not been proven. There is no general agreement on the treatment of LVHT. According to expert opinions, LVHT patients require anticoagulation if they meet the criteria for anticoagulation or an ICD if they meet the appropriate criteria.

In this cross-sectional study, 241 carers and their children from 10 daycares were recruited and asked to complete a questionnaire aimed at assessing their sociodemographic profile and oral health-related behaviors. This was followed by a dental examination of the children by two calibrated dentists. Caries status was recorded using the dmft index. Chi-square and logistic regression tests were used to analyze the data (p < 0.05). The mean dmft of the children was 4.39 (SD ± 4.25). According to logistic regression analysis, children who were bottle-fed between 7 and 12 months (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR): 0.110) or breastfed between 13 and 18 months (AOR: 0.028) were less likely to have ECC than those with a prolonged feeding duration (>18 months). Also, those with smoking carers (AOR: 0.176) were less likely to have ECC than those with nonsmoking carers. On the other hand, children who had working carers, mainly mothers, in the education sector (AOR: 11.105), were more likely to have ECC (p < 0.05). The risk factors associated with the presence of ECC among preschool children in eastern Saudi Arabia include the mother's occupation and the carer's smoking status, as well as feeding practices (particularly bottle feeding). These factors can be modified by encouraging carers to completely wean their children (particularly from the bottle) by 18 months of age and advising working mothers to perform tooth brushing for their children in the morning before they go to work and in the evening before the children go to bed.","Al-Haj Ali, Sanaa N; Alsineedi, Faisal; Alsamari, Nouf; Alduhayan, Ghaida; BaniHani, Alaa; Farah, Ra'fat I",Science progress,https://doi.org/10.1177/00368504211008308; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33861673/,476

Recently, corona viral epidemic raised the issue of developing effective antiviral agents at the earliest to prevent further losses. Natural products have always played a crucial role in drug development process against various diseases which resulted in screening of such agents to combat emergent mutants of corona virus. This review focuses on those natural compounds that showed promising results against corona viruses. Although inhibition of viral replication is often considered as a general mechanism for antiviral activity of most of the natural products, studies have shown that some natural products can interact with key viral proteins that are associated with virulence. In this context, some of the natural products have antiviral activity in the nanomolar concentration (e.g., lycorine, homoharringtonine, silvestrol, ouabain, tylophorine and 7-methoxycryptopleurine), and could be leads for further drug development on their own or as a template for drug design. In addition, a good number of natural products with anti-corona virus activity are the major constituents of some common dietary supplements which can be exploited to improve the immunity of the general population in certain epidemics.

We retrospectively compared pediatric teledermatology visits scheduled during the pandemic (03/17/2020-07/31/2020) with in-person appointments scheduled during the same period in 2019 and found that Spanish-speaking patients had significantly fewer scheduled appointments in 2020 (9% vs 5%, P < .001). Among the telemedicine cohort, Spanish-speaking patients were less likely to have an email address documented within the electronic medical record and less likely to have activated an online patient portal account prior to their visit during the pandemic (45% vs 62%, P = .017, and 23% vs 66%, P < .001, respectively).

In stroke, delayed or avoided care may translate to substantial morbidity. We sought to determine the effect of the pandemic on patterns of stroke patient presentation and quality of care. METHODS We analyzed data from 25 New England hospitals: one urban, academic comprehensive stroke center and telestroke hub, and 24 spoke hospitals in the telestroke network. We included all telestroke consultations from the 24 spokes, and all stroke admissions to the comprehensive stroke center hub from November 1, 2019 through April 30, 2020. We compared rates of presentation, timeliness presentation, and quality of care pre- versus post-March 1, 2020. We examined trends in patient demographics, stroke severity, timeliness, diagnoses including large vessel occlusion, alteplase use, and endovascular thrombectomy among eligible subjects. We compared proportions and bivariate comparisons to examine for changes pre- versus post-March 1, 2020 and used linear regression to examine trends over time. RESULTS Among 1248 patient presentations (844 telestroke consultations, 404 comprehensive stroke center admissions), telestroke consultations and ischemic stroke patient admissions decreased among the spokes and hub. Age and stroke severity were unchanged over the study period. We found no change in alteplase administration at telestroke spoke hospitals but did note a decrease in both alteplase use and thrombectomy at our comprehensive stroke center. Time metrics for patient presentation and care delivery were unchanged; however, rates of adherence for the quality measures dysphagia screening, early antithrombotic initiation, and early venous thromboembolism prophylaxis were reduced during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS In this regional analysis, we found decreasing telestroke consultations and ischemic stroke admissions, and reduced performance on stroke quality of care measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Contrary to prior reports, we did not find an increase in thrombectomy nor decrease in clinical severity that might be expected if patients with milder symptoms avoided hospitalization.","Etherton, Mark R; Zachrison, Kori S; Yan, Zhiyu; Sveikata, Lukas; Bretzner, Martin; Estrada, Juan; Viswanathan, Anand; Singhal, Aneesh B; Schwamm, Lee H",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.120.031300; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33588592/,476

We present a single center's long term experience with ADAPT. METHODS Retrospective analysis of a database was gathered on patients undergoing stroke thrombectomy with ADAPT at a stroke center. Speciﬁc parameters captured included age, gender, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score at presentation, time to presentation from last normal, and modiﬁed Rankin Scale (mRS) score at the 90 day follow-up. Radiological and angiographic imaging was reviewed to document the location of the vascular occlusion, Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) ﬂow postprocedure, and procedural complications. RESULTS 191 consecutive patients who suffered an AIS treated with ADAPT were reviewed; 91 were women, and mean age was 67 years. Patients presented with a mean NIHSS score of 15.4, and 71 patients received intravenous tissue plasminogen activator. The average time from onset to puncture was 7.8 h. The average time for recanalization was 37.3 min. TICI 2B or better recanalization was achieved in 180 (94.2%) patients. 98 (54.1%) patients had an mRS of 0-2 at 90 days. Direct aspiration alone was performed in 145 cases, and 43 cases required the additional use of a stent retriever. There was no significant difference in presenting NIHSS score, average time to presentation, average mRS at 90 days, or 90 day mortality between the two groups. Time to recanalization was 29.6 min for direct aspiration compared with 61.4 min in cases that required adjunct devices (p=0.00000201). 79 (57.7%) patients who underwent direct aspiration only achieved a good outcome at 90 days (mRS 0-2) compared with 19 (43.2%) who underwent adjunct therapies (p=0.12). CONCLUSIONS ADAPT is an effective method to achieve good clinical and angiographic outcomes, and serves as a useful firstline method for revascularization.","Vargas, Jan; Spiotta, Alejandro; Fargen, Kyle; Turner, Raymond; Chaudry, Imran; Turk, Aquilla",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2015-012211; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27091750/,476

These changes resulted in various environmental, economic, social, and regulatory impacts in waste management practices which not only complicate regional policy analysis, but also reshape the paradigm of global sustainable development. Systems analysis, a discipline that harmonizes these integrated solid waste management strategies, has been uniquely providing interdisciplinary support for decision making in this area. Systems engineering models and system assessment tools, both of which enrich the analytical framework of waste management, were designed specifically to handle particular types of problems. Though how to smooth out the barriers toward achieving appropriate systems synthesis and integration of these models and tools to aid in the solid waste management schemes prevalent in European countries still remains somewhat uncertain. This paper conducts a thorough literature review of models and tools illuminating possible overlapped boundaries in waste management practices in European countries and encompassing the pros and cons of waste management practices in each member state of the European Union. Whereas the Southern European Union (EU) countries need to develop further measures to implement more integrated solid waste management and reach EU directives, the Central EU countries need models and tools with which to rationalize their technological choices and management strategies. Nevertheless, considering systems analysis models and tools in a synergistic way would certainly provide opportunities to develop better solid waste management strategies leading to conformity with current standards and foster future perspectives for both the waste management industry and government agencies in European Union.","Pires, Ana; Martinho, Graça; Chang, Ni-Bin",Journal of environmental management,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2010.11.024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21194829/,476

Efforts to improve eye health contribute to the advancement of several SDGs, including those not exclusively health-related. This scoping review will summarise the nature and extent of the published literature that demonstrates a link between improved eye health and advancement of the SDGs. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Searches will be conducted in MEDLINE, Embase and Global Health for published, peer-reviewed manuscripts, with no time period, language or geographic limits. All intervention and observational studies will be included if they report a link between a change in eye health and (1) an outcome related to one of the SDGs or (2) an element on a pathway between eye health and an SDG (eg, productivity). Two investigators will independently screen titles and abstracts, followed by full-text screening of potentially relevant articles. Reference lists of all included articles will be examined to identify further potentially relevant studies. Conflicts between the two independent investigators will be discussed and resolved with a third investigator. For included articles, data regarding publication characteristics, study details and SDG-related outcomes will be extracted. Results will be synthesised by mapping the extracted data to a logic model, which will be refined through an iterative process during data synthesis. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION As this scoping review will only include published data, ethics approval will not be sought. The findings of the review will be published in an open-access, peer-reviewed journal.

His fame came chiefly from his extensive explorations in South America, and his eminence as a plant naturalist. He attempted to climb the inactive volcano, Chimborazo, in Ecuador, which was thought to be the highest mountain in the world at the time, and he reached an altitude of about 5543 m which was a record height for humans. During the climb, he had typical symptoms of acute mountain sickness which he correctly attributed to the low level of oxygen, and he was apparently the first person to make this connection. His ability as a naturalist enabled him to recognize the effect of high altitude on the distribution of plants, and by comparing his observations on Chimborazo with those in the European Alps and elsewhere, he inferred that the deleterious effects of high altitude were universal. During his return trip to Europe he called on President Thomas Jefferson in Washington where he was given a warm reception and discussed conservation issues. He then returned to Paris where he produced 29 volumes over a period of 31 years describing his travels. Here the effects of high altitude on the distribution of plants compared with animals is briefly reviewed. Following Humboldt's death in 1859, there was extensive coverage of his contributions, but curiously, his fame has diminished over the years, and inexplicably, he now has a much lower profile in North America.","West, John B",American journal of physiology.

MATERIAL AND METHODS A veneer and a crown preparation were performed on a central incisor and a second molar of a dental model, respectively, scanned with an intraoral scanner, and the .stl files were exported to an LCD-based SLA three-dimensional (3D)-Printer. Twenty-four preparations were 3D-printed for each veneer and crown and divided into four groups (n = 6/group): (a) Acrylic resin (Acrílico Marche); (b) Bisacrylic resin (Protemp 4); (c) PMMA computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) (Vipiblock); and (d) 3D-printed resin for provisional restorations (Raydent C&B for temporary crown and bridge). Veneers and crowns restorations were performed and cemented with a flowable composite. Each specimen was scanned with a μCT apparatus, files were imported for data analysis, and cement film thickness was quantitatively measured. Data were analyzed by 2-way ANOVA and Tukey post-hoc tests (α = .05). RESULTS Crowns presented a thicker cementation film than veneers (P < .05).The bisacrylic resin showed the smallest veneer film thickness, similar to the acrylic resin (P = .151), which was not significantly different than the PMMA CAD/CAM material (P = .153). The 3D printed provisional material showed the thicker film, different than all other materials (P < .05). The bisacrylic resin showed a cement film thickness with a high number of voids in its surface. For crowns cementation, the 3D printed provisional material showed the thicker cementation film, different than all other materials (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS Different provisional materials present different film thicknesses. The 3D printed provisional material showed the highest veneer and crown film thicknesses. Veneers film thicknesses were smaller than crowns for all provisional materials. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE The 3D printed provisional material studied can be satisfactorily used, presenting appropriate adaptation with the tooth preparation, however, it shows the highest cement film thickness for both veneers and crowns cementations when compared with other provisional materials. A better internal fit, or smaller cement film thickness is obtained by CAD/CAM materials, acrylic and bisacrylic resins. Veneer cementation showed a smaller cement film thickness compared with crown cementation for all provisional materials.","Sampaio, Camila S; Niemann, Katherin D; Schweitzer, Daniel D; Hirata, Ronaldo; Atria, Pablo J",Journal of esthetic and restorative dentistry : official publication of the American Academy of Esthetic Dentistry ...

Here, we show XIST is continually required in adult human B cells to silence a subset of X-linked immune genes such as TLR7. XIST-dependent genes lack promoter DNA methylation and require continual XIST-dependent histone deacetylation. XIST RNA-directed proteomics and CRISPRi screen reveal distinctive somatic cell-type-specific XIST complexes and identify TRIM28 that mediates Pol II pausing at promoters of X-linked genes in B cells. Single-cell transcriptome data of female patients with either systemic lupus erythematosus or COVID-19 infection revealed XIST dysregulation, reflected by escape of XIST-dependent genes, in CD11c+ atypical memory B cells (ABCs). XIST inactivation with TLR7 agonism suffices to promote isotype-switched ABCs. These results indicate cell-type-specific diversification and function for lncRNA-protein complexes and suggest expanded roles for XIST in sex-differences in biology and medicine.","Yu, Bingfei; Qi, Yanyan; Li, Rui; Shi, Quanming; Satpathy, Ansuman T; Chang, Howard Y",Cell,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2021.02.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33735607/,476

METHODS The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality in adults with COVID-19 admitted to intensive care units across the US. Secondary outcomes were acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy (AKI-RRT), thrombotic events, and seven blood markers of inflammation and thrombosis. Unadjusted and multivariable-adjusted models were used. RESULTS Among the 4908 study patients mean (SD) age was 60.9 (14.7) years, 3095 (62.8%) were male, and 2552 (52.0%) were obese. In multivariable models, BMI was not associated with mortality. Higher BMI beginning at 25 kg/m2 was associated with a greater risk of ARDS and AKI-RRT but not thrombosis. There was no clinically significant association between BMI and inflammatory or thrombotic markers. CONCLUSIONS In critically ill patients with COVID-19, higher BMI was not associated with death or thrombotic events but was associated with a greater risk of ARDS and AKI-RRT. The lack of an association between BMI and circulating biomarkers raises into question the paradigm that obesity contributes to poor outcomes in critically ill patients with COVID-19 by upregulating systemic inflammatory and prothrombotic pathways.","Friedman, Allon N; Guirguis, John; Kapoor, Raj; Gupta, Shruti; Leaf, David E; Timsina, Lava R",Obesity,https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.23245; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34109768/,476

We performed a systematic review of the literature, including a case of a DAVF associated with a flow-related intraorbital ophthalmic artery (OA) aneurysm that we have recently managed. The purpose of our study was to clarify epidemiology, natural history, and management of these lesions. A total of 43 published cases of DAVF associated aneurysms were found in 26 studies on the topic. Anterior cranial fossa was the most common location (40%), and ethmoidal branches were the most common arterial feeders (55%). In about 63% of cases, the aneurysm was located on artery unrelated to DAVF supply. Approximately 10% of intracranial DAVFs were associated with aneurysms located in the intraorbital OA. Overall, 70% of lesions were Borden type III, and 50% of patients presented with hemorrhage. In approximately 17% of cases, the source of bleeding was a feeding artery aneurysm. All of the reported intraorbital OA aneurysms associated with DAVFs remained stable during follow-up. DAVF associated aneurysms are fairly rare. Anterior cranial fossa location and direct cortical venous drainage are common among these lesions. The aneurysms are less likely to be located on feeding arteries, and hemorrhagic presentation related to flow-related aneurysm rupture is uncommon.","Cagnazzo, Federico; Peluso, Andrea; Vannozzi, Riccardo; Brinjikji, Waleed; Lanzino, Giuseppe; Perrini, Paolo",Neurosurgical review,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10143-017-0929-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29177821/,476
80543,COVID-19: A poverty-aware perspective.,2021,"It is a fundamental question in disease modeling how the initial seeding of an epidemic, spreading over a network, determines its final outcome. One important goal has been to find the seed configuration, which infects the most individuals. Although the identified optimal configurations give insight into how the initial state affects the outcome of an epidemic, they are unlikely to occur in real life. In this paper we identify two important seeding scenarios, both motivated by historical data, that reveal a complex phenomenon. In one scenario, the seeds are concentrated on the central nodes of a network, while in the second one, they are spread uniformly in the population. Comparing the final size of the epidemic started from these two initial conditions through data-driven and synthetic simulations on real and modeled geometric metapopulation networks, we find evidence for a switchover phenomenon: When the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] is close to its critical value, more individuals become infected in the first seeding scenario, but for larger values of [Formula: see text], the second scenario is more dangerous. We find that the switchover phenomenon is amplified by the geometric nature of the underlying network and confirm our results via mathematically rigorous proofs, by mapping the network epidemic processes to bond percolation. Our results expand on the previous finding that, in the case of a single seed, the first scenario is always more dangerous and further our understanding of why the sizes of consecutive waves of a pandemic can differ even if their epidemic characters are similar.","Ódor, Gergely; Czifra, Domonkos; Komjáthy, Júlia; Lovász, László; Karsai, Márton",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2112607118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34620714/,476

80989,Response of a European surgical department to the COVID-19 crisis.,2020-04-06,"BACKGROUND Delirium is a neuropsychiatric disorder of attention and awareness that develops over a short time and fluctuates in severity. While delirium has been extensively studied in Intensive Care Units, the incidence of delirium in stroke units and its predictors in stroke patients need further investigation. The endpoints of our study were incidence of delirium in acute stroke and the risk factors that predispose to this condition. METHODS Patients were consecutively enrolled in a stroke unit from April to October 2020. Inclusion criteria were: age≥18 years, acute stroke and National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS)≥1 at the time of clinical assessment of delirium. Exclusion criteria were: transient ischemic attack, absence of neuroimaging evidence of brain lesion, cerebral venous thrombosis, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and clinical conditions requiring intensive care unit treatment. All patients were evaluated by means of Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) and Confusion Assessment Method-Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) at baseline, which were repeated within 72 hours or when patients developed symptoms suggesting delirium. RESULTS The overall incidence of delirium was 36/120 (30%). Delirium was associated with aphasia (OR=9.77; CI=1.2-79.6), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR=16.67; CI=1.1-263.0), deep Fazekas score (OR=5.05; CI=1.7-14.8), and physical restraint (OR=45.02; CI=1.4-1411.5). Diabetes was associated with lower incidence of delirium (OR=0.04; CI=0.026-0.7). CONCLUSIONS Nearly one third of patients (30%) had delirium in the acute phase of stroke. This finding supports the notion that delirium is a common complication of stroke. Delirium was associated with speech disorder, leukoencephalopathy, chronic pulmonary disease and early use of physical restraint.","Rollo, Eleonora; Callea, Antonio; Brunetti, Valerio; Vollono, Catello; Marotta, Jessica; Imperatori, Claudio; Frisullo, Giovanni; Broccolini, Aldobrando; Della Marca, Giacomo",European journal of neurology,https://doi.org/10.1111/ene.14749; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33476475/,476

This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and need for certifying practicing surgeons and to assess proficiency of operating room (OR) personnel. METHODS Through a patient safety and health care delivery effectiveness grant, investigators at four state medical schools received funding for FLS certification of all attending surgeons and OR personnel credentialed in laparoscopy. Data were voluntarily collected under an institutional review board-approved protocol. Surgeons performed a single repetition of the FLS tasks oriented to the FLS proficiency-based curriculum and online cognitive materials and were encouraged to self-practice. The FLS certification examination was administered 2 months later under standard conditions. Operating room nurses and scrub technicians were enrolled in a curriculum with cognitive materials and a multistation skills practicum. Baseline and completion questionnaires were administered. Performance was assessed using signed-rank and χ(2) analysis. RESULTS The study aimed to enroll 99 surgeons. Subsequently, 87 surgeons completed at least one portion of the curriculum, 72 completed the entire curriculum (73% compliance), 83 completed the baseline skills assessment, and 27 (33%) failed. The self-reported practice time was 3.7 ± 2.5 h. At certification (n = 76), skills performance had improved from 317 ± 102.9 to 402 ± 54.2 (p < 0.0001). One surgeon (1.3%) failed the skills certification, and nine (11.8%) failed the cognitive exam. Remediation was completed by six surgeons. Of the 64 enrolled OR personnel, 22 completed the curriculum (34% compliance). All achieved proficiency at skills, and 60% passed the cognitive exam. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrated that FLS certification for practicing surgeons and proficiency verification for OR personnel are feasible. A baseline skills failure rate of 33% and a certification failure rate of 13% suggest that FLS certification may be necessary to ensure surgeon competency. Fortunately, with only moderate practice, significant improvement can be achieved.","Hafford, Melanie L; Van Sickle, Kent R; Willis, Ross E; Wilson, Todd D; Gugliuzza, Kristine; Brown, Kimberly M; Scott, Daniel J",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-012-2437-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22773236/,476

84726,Lung Ultrasound in Children With COVID-19.,2020-04-21,"BACKGROUND Parenchyma-sparing hepatectomy techniques allow a lesser volume resection (<3 adjacent segments) for tumors involving the hepatic veins at the hepatocaval confluence, assuring adequate volume of the future liver remnant. We report the ability to perform parenchyma-sparing hepatectomy as planned from the preoperative imaging and the type of vascular intervention used to preserve hepatic outflow. METHODS We analyzed 60 consecutive parenchyma-sparing hepatectomies in 54 patients for 7 primary and 53 metastatic tumors (48 colorectal), located in segments I, VII, VIII, or IVa and involving the hepatocaval confluence. Patients had a median of 2 (range: 1-18) lesions with median diameter of 4 cm (range: 1.2-16.5), which were bilateral in 43%. RESULTS A parenchyma-sparing hepatectomy was performed in all of the 60 cases, only one case required the resection of 3 adjacent segments. In 16 (27%) hepatic veins-resections, the outflow was assured by preservation of the inferior-right-hepatic veins in 3 (5%), of the communicating-veins in 4 (7%), of the middle-hepatic veins in 3 (4%; middle-hepatic veins patch-reconstruction in 2 cases), by polytetrafluoroethylene-grafts in 4 (7%), and by hepatic veins-anastomosis in 2 (3%). In 15 (25%) cases, the hepatic veins were resected tangentially and reconstructed by direct suture venorraphy. In 29 (48%) cases, the hepatic veins were skeletonized from the tumor. Grade IIIb to IV complications occurred in 7%, median hospital-stay was 9 days, and 90-day mortality occurred in one cirrhotic patient. Median overall and disease-free survivals were 72 and 16 months (median follow-up: 34 months). CONCLUSION A lesser volume parenchyma-sparing hepatectomy rather than a formal major hepatectomy for tumors involving the hepatocaval confluence can be performed with a low rate of major complications (7%). Parenchyma-sparing hepatectomy should be considered in highly selected patients when evaluating liver resection for tumors involving the hepatocaval confluence based on appropriate and accurate preoperative imaging.","Urbani, Lucio; Colombatto, Piero; Balestri, Riccardo; Licitra, Gabriella; Leoni, Chiara; Forfori, Francesco; Masi, Gianluca; Boraschi, Piero; Castagna, Maura; Buccianti, Piero",Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.surg.2017.02.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28549521/,476

METHODS The protocol was registered in PROSPERO with ID#232253. Eligible studies identified from four electronic databases. Search, data extraction and quality assessment were performed independently by two reviewers. Studies with perioperative, functional, early and late complication outcomes included. RESULTS Twenty-five studies, 14 593 patients including 1 randomized controlled trial, 11 prospective and 13 retrospective studies included for meta-analysis. This showed higher risk of immediate transient recatherization (risk ratio [RR]: 5.29, p < 0.00001), longer days to trial-off-catheter (mean difference [MD]: 0.25, p < 0.00001), longer hospitalization stay in the UR group (MD: 0.35, p < 0.00001), and higher risk of intraoperative blood transfusions (RR: 1.90, p = 0.002), postoperative urinary tract infections (RR: 1.49, p < 0.00001) and sepsis (RR: 8.15, p = 0.009) too. Failure of surgery like permanent recatheterization (RR: 5.27, p < 0.00001) was more in preoperative UR group. Negligible differences seen in long term functional outcomes between the two groups (International Prostate Symptom Score at 12 months, MD: -0.06, p = 0.68; Quality of Life at 12 months, MD: 0.20, p < 0.00001; maximum urinary flow rate at 12 months, MD: -0.33, p = 0.10; and postvoid residual volume at 12 months, MD: 4.32, p < 0.00001). CONCLUSIONS Preoperative UR patients undergoing surgery for BPH have higher risk of postoperative complications versus LUTS only group including the need for permanent catheterization. Both groups had similar long-term functional outcomes. We could infer that patients with UR on whom surgery is successful, with time may recover bladder function akin to patients with LUTS alone.","Law, Yu Xi Terence; Castellani, Daniele; Dell'atti, Lucio; Aho, Tevita; Teoh, Jeremy Yuen-Chun; Gauhar, Vineet",Neurourology and urodynamics,https://doi.org/10.1002/nau.24708; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34036628/,476

Methods We developed three models during the epidemic: a discrete model to predict the maximum burden on the health system in a short time framea basic SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infected-removed) model with discrete equations; a stochastic SEIR model with the Monte Carlo method; and a Gompertz-type model for metropolitan city of Santiago. Results The maximum potential burden model has been useful throughout the monitoring of the epidemic, providing an upper bound for the number of cases, intensive care unit occupancy, and deaths. Deterministic and stochastic SEIR models were very useful in predicting the rise of cases and the peak and onset of case decline; however, they lost utility in the current situation due to the asynchronous recruitment of cases in the regions and the persistence of a strong endemic. The Gompertz model had a better fit in the decline since it best captures the epidemic curves asymmetry in Santiago. Conclusions The models have shown great utility in monitoring the epidemic in Chile, with different objectives in different epidemic stages. They have complemented empirical indicators such as reported cases, fatality, deaths, and others, making it possible to predict situations of interest and visualization of the short and long-term local behavior of this pandemic.","Canals, Mauricio; Cuadrado, Cristóbal; Canals, Andrea",Medwave,https://doi.org/10.5867/medwave.2021.01.8119; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33617518/,476

We analyse the impact of the pandemic on telemedicine applied in Spanish headache consultations, review the literature, and issue recommendations for the implementation of telemedicine in consultations. METHOD The study comprised 3 phases: 1) review of the MEDLINE database since 1958 (first reported experience with telemedicine); 2) Google Forms survey sent to all members of the Spanish Society of Neurology's Headache Study Group (GECSEN); and 3) online consensus of GECSEN experts to issue recommendations for the implementation of telemedicine in Spain. RESULTS COVID-19 has increased waiting times for face-to-face consultations, increasing the use of all telemedicine modalities: landline telephone (from 75% before April 2020 to 97% after), mobile telephone (from 9% to 27%), e-mail (from 30% to 36%), and video consultation (from 3% to 21%). Neurologists are aware of the need to expand the availability of video consultations, which are clearly growing, and other e-health and m-health tools. CONCLUSIONS The GECSEN recommends and encourages all neurologists who assist patients with headaches to implement telemedicine resources, with the optimal objective of offering video consultation to patients under 60-65 years of age and telephone calls to older patients, although each case must be considered on an individual basis.

A recent scoping review by the authors found that both depression and anxiety frequently featured in the accounts of those living with the illness. However, less clear were the factors that led to such psychological distress, the impact that the illness had on families and how to best support those living or supporting someone living with the illness. In light of this, the aim of this study was to explore how the illness impacted the lives of both those diagnosed with the illness and those supporting them. METHOD AND RESULTS This study adopted a phenomenological approach to understand the subjective experiences of individual participants. A total of 30 individuals took part in Asynchronous Virtual Focus Groups hosted on a Virtual Learning Environment for a four-week period. Chronological narratives of individuals' lived experiences from diagnosis to post-transplant are presented below. These narratives centred upon individuals' and families' experiences of receiving a diagnosis, and adjusting to life post-diagnosis, particularly in regard to their relationships with health professionals and other family members, and in preparing for the possibility of transplant.

This is primarily attributed to the efficacy of venetoclax as a time-limited, chemo-free, therapy in a field dominated by targeted agents given on a continuous schedule. Furthermore, compelling clinical data support the use of venetoclax in combination with other targeted agents in the hope of preventing drug resistance due to the emergence of acquired mutations.Areas covered: This paper provides an overview on clinical results of newly approved or investigational venetoclax-based therapies for CLL. In view of current and potential roles in CLL care, the strengths and disadvantages of venetoclax-combinations are discussed. The MEDLINE database, ClinicalTrials.gov and conference proceedings were all reviewed to select the relevant literature.Expert Opinion: While the advent of venetoclax-based combinations has significantly expanded the therapeutic options for patients with CLL, further research with longer follow-up is required to address remaining open questions such as (I) the role of venetoclax as fixed duration therapy(II) timing and threshold of minimal residual disease (MRD) assessment for therapy discontinuation, (III) the efficacy of novel triplet combinations with venetoclax as backbone therapy, (IV) indications for the re-initiation of therapy with venetoclax.","Molica, Stefano; Allsup, David; Gianfelici, Valentina; Levato, Luciano; Aiello, Vincenzo; Bailey, James; Polliack, Aaron",Expert opinion on investigational drugs,https://doi.org/10.1080/13543784.2021.1924669; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33929928/,476
87778,Ethical challenges posed by COVID-19.,2020-08-29,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE Due to the COVID-19 pandemic all schools in Poland were closed and obliged to conduct lessons remotely. The aim of the study is to present the demographic analysis of difficulties with remote learning, as perceived by students during coronavirus pandemic in Poland. MATERIAL AND METHODS In April 2020, a nationwide online survey was conducted among adolescents aged 11-18 (N=2408). Quantitative and qualitative data were used. Teenagers were asked about the problems connected with remote learning. In order to examine the overall level of remote learning difficulties, a scale of remote learning difficulties (RLD) was devised (range 0-23 points). Differences connected with gender, age and place of residence were analysed. RESULTS More than a half of the teenagers surveyed rated the increased demands from teachers as a major problem. This answer appeared statistically more often among girls than boys (59.6% v. 53.2%). Almost every third adolescent saw the lack of consultation (31.6%) as a significant problem. Difficulties related to learning in the remote system were most often described as considerable by the oldest students (17-18-years-old) and those living in rural areas. The big problem for them was usually much higher requirements of teachers and poor organization of distance learning. The mean level on the scale of remote learning burden was M=11.9 (SD=7.1). Technical difficulties and insufficient skills in using software constituted additional problems most frequently mentioned by students. CONCLUSIONS There is a need to pay particular attention to organizing appropriate technical conditions for remote learning, especially in rural areas, where students have complained more often than in cities about equipment and problems with access to the Internet during the pandemic.","Korzycka, Magdalena; Bójko, Martyna; Radiukiewicz, Katarzyna; Dzielska, Anna; Nałęcz, Hanna; Kleszczewska, Dorota; Małkowska-Szkutnik, Agnieszka; Fijałkowska, Anna",Annals of agricultural and environmental medicine : AAEM,https://doi.org/10.26444/aaem/133100; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33775081/,476

MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively evaluated the effects ofinfliximab treatmentin patients with complex idiopathic anal fistulas refractory to standard surgical intervention. The primary outcome was achievement of substantial clinical improvement defined as sustained, reduced inflammatory activity at perioperativeevaluation, i.e., only minimal-to-moderate secretion and induration and a reduction of fistula size of a magnitude that would make it possible to perform a lay-open or sphincter-sparring closure procedure. Secondary outcomes weresymptom improvement, adverse treatment events and fistula healing after the surgical procedure in those achieving the primary outcome. RESULTS Twenty-two patients were included (18 high transsphincteric, 3complex low transsphincteric, 1 suprasphincteric fistula). Fistulas had been present for a median of 24 [interquartile range, IQR: 12-33] months. In total, 16 patients (73%) achieved the primary outcome of substantial clinical improvement. Median time from infliximab initiation to patients achieved the primary outcome was 11 [IQR: 8-22] months. Sixteen of the patients responding to infliximab received subsequent lay-open or sphincter-sparring closure procedure surgery. Of these, ten (63%) achieved fistula healing. No serious infectious complications to infliximab treatment were seen. One patient developed a new abscess. One patient developed psoriasis (pustolosispalmoplantaris). CONCLUSIONS Infliximab treatment may be considered a supplement to repeated curettage and setondrainage in the management of selected, complex idiopathic anal fistulas. Such combined treatment may make otherwise refractory fistulas amenable to definitive closure attempts.","Dige, Anders; Nordholm-Carstensen, Andreas; Hagen, Kikke; Hougaard, Helene Tarri; Krogh, Klaus; Agnholt, Jørgen; Pedersen, Bodil Ginnerup; Lundby, Lilli",Scandinavian journal of gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1080/00365521.2021.1879246; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33617372/,476
89679,"Statement of Retraction: COVID-19, Suicide, and Femicide: rapid research using Google Search Phrases.",2021-05-19,"CONTEXT Accessory spleen is a congenital abnormality consisting of normal splenic tissue in ectopic sites that is found in approximately 10-15% of the general population. However, an intrapancreatic accessory spleen has seldom been reported and multiple epithelial cysts in the intrapancreatic accessory spleen are extremely rare. CASE REPORT A 37-year-old woman with no clinical manifestations presented with two cystic lesions in the tail of the pancreas. The tumor markers CA 19-9 (251 U/mL) and SPAN-1 (38 U/mL) were increased. Computed tomography showed a multilocular cyst, 40 mm in size, and a unilocular cyst, 20 mm in size, in the tail of the pancreas and gallstones. The cystic component was hypointense on T1-weighted magnetic resonance images and hyperintense on T2-weighted magnetic resonance images. A laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy was performed with the presumptive diagnosis of a mucinous cystic neoplasm or an intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm with gallstones. The pathological examination showed that the walls of the two cysts were covered with non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium, surrounded by normal splenic tissue. The final pathological diagnosis was two epithelial cysts originating from an intrapancreatic accessory spleen. CONCLUSIONS Even though multiple masses were detected in the pancreatic tail, the possibility of epithelial cysts originating from an accessory spleen should be considered. Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy might be a safe and effective procedure and provide good cosmetic result for a benign or low-grade malignant tumor in the pancreas.","Wakasugi, Masaki; Tori, Masayuki; Akamatsu, Hiroki; Ueshima, Shigeyuki; Omori, Takeshi; Tei, Mitsuyoshi; Masuzawa, Toru; Tsujimoto, Masahiko; Nishida, Toshirou",JOP : Journal of the pancreas,https://doi.org/10.6092/1590-8577/1784; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24216550/,476
90396,Approaching Process Improvement.,2020-10-01,"OBJECTIVE To analyse the measures adopted by countries that have shown control over the transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and how each curve of accumulated cases behaved after the implementation of those measures. METHODS The methodology adopted for this study comprises three phases: systemizing control measures adopted by different countries, identifying structural breaks in the growth of the number of cases for those countries, and analyzing Brazilian data in particular. RESULTS We noted that China (excluding Hubei Province), Hubei Province, and South Korea have been effective in their deceleration of the growth rates of COVID-19 cases. The effectiveness of the measures taken by these countries could be seen after 1 to 2 weeks of their application. In Italy and Spain, control measures at the national level were taken at a late stage of the epidemic, which could have contributed to the high propagation of COVID-19. In Brazil, Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo adopted measures that could be effective in slowing the propagation of the virus. However, we only expect to see their effects on the growth of the curve in the coming days. CONCLUSION Our results may help decisionmakers in countries in relatively early stages of the epidemic, especially Brazil, understand the importance of control measures in decelerating the growth curve of confirmed cases.","Antunes, Bianca Brandão de Paula; Peres, Igor Tona; Baião, Fernanda Araújo; Ranzani, Otavio Tavares; Bastos, Leonardo Dos Santos Lourenço; Silva, Amanda de Araújo Batista da; Souza, Guilherme Faveret Garcia de; Marchesi, Janaina Figueira; Dantas, Leila Figueiredo; Vargas, Soraida Aguilar; Maçaira, Paula; Hamacher, Silvio; Bozza, Fernando Augusto",Revista Brasileira de terapia intensiva,https://doi.org/10.5935/0103-507x.20200028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32490890/,476

Despite the minimally invasive procedure, valve placement is associated with risks, the most common of which is pneumothorax. This study was designed to identify predictors of pneumothorax following endoscopic valve implantation. METHODS Preinterventional clinical measures (vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, residual volume, total lung capacity, 6-minute walk test), qualitative computed tomography (CT) parameters (fissure integrity, blebs/bulla, subpleural nodules, pleural adhesions, partial atelectasis, fibrotic bands, emphysema type) and quantitative CT parameters (volume and low attenuation volume of the target lobe and the ipsilateral untreated lobe, target air trapping, ipsilateral lobe volume/hemithorax volume, collapsibility of the target lobe and the ipsilateral untreated lobe) were retrospectively evaluated in patients who underwent endoscopic valve placement (n=129). Regression analysis was performed to compare those who developed pneumothorax following valve therapy (n=46) with those who developed target lobe volume reduction without pneumothorax (n=83). FINDING Low attenuation volume% of ipsilateral untreated lobe (odds ratio [OR] =1.08, P=0.001), ipsilateral untreated lobe volume/hemithorax volume (OR =0.93, P=0.017), emphysema type (OR =0.26, P=0.018), pleural adhesions (OR =0.33, P=0.012) and residual volume (OR =1.58, P=0.012) were found to be significant predictors of pneumothorax. Fissure integrity (OR =1.16, P=0.075) and 6-minute walk test (OR =1.05, P=0.077) were also indicative of pneumothorax. The model including the aforementioned parameters predicted whether a patient would experience a pneumothorax 84% of the time (area under the curve =0.84). INTERPRETATION Clinical and CT parameters provide a promising tool to effectively identify patients at high risk of pneumothorax following endoscopic valve therapy.","Gompelmann, Daniela; Lim, Hyun-Ju; Eberhardt, Ralf; Gerovasili, Vasiliki; Herth, Felix Jf; Heussel, Claus Peter; Eichinger, Monika",International journal of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,https://doi.org/10.2147/copd.s106439; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27536088/,476

With 1 million deaths reported in 1996, measles was the leading cause of vaccine-preventable deaths. However, in recent years, significant progress has been made in measles control, reducing deaths attributed to measles to 454,000 in 2004 and 242,000 in 2006. The main strategy behind this reduction has been the improvement of vaccination coverage and implementation of a second opportunity for immunization with the live-attenuated measles vaccine. The Measles Initiative, a partnership between the American Red Cross, CDC, UNICEF, WHO and UN Foundation, has had a significant role in this achievement. Here, we provide an overview of old and new vaccination strategies, and discuss changes in the route of administration of the existing live-attenuated vaccine, the development of new-generation nonreplicating measles virus vaccine candidates and attempts to use recombinant measles virus as a vector for vaccination against other pathogens.","de Vries, Rory D; Stittelaar, Koert J; Osterhaus, Albert D M E; de Swart, Rik L",Expert review of vaccines,https://doi.org/10.1586/14760584.7.8.1215; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18844595/,476

Methods We employed exploratory design using qualitative technique. In-depth interviews were conducted with 44 adult (18 years and older) volunteers in four rural communities in Ebonyi State, Nigeria. After thematic analysis using NVivo 11 Pro software, eight sub-themes emerged, among which are: types of FGM practiced, seasons for FGM, FGM by health workers and community leaders, punishment for refusing FGM and knowledge of health implications of FGM. Results Findings show that FGM is more like a process than just an act, and type most practiced in the study area is Type 1. Circumcisers are health workers and women leaders. Knowledge of health implications of FGM was found to be low among those interviewed. Conclusion Based on the findings, we concluded that FGM is still practiced in some rural communities in Nigeria, maybe because of poor knowledge of health implications of FGM.","Odo, Amelia Ngozi; Dibia, Samuel Ifeanyi Christian; Nwagu, Evelyn Nwanebe; Umoke, MaryJoy; Umoke, Prince Christian Ifeanachor",African health sciences,https://doi.org/10.4314/ahs.v20i4.55; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394263/,476

METHODS In a prospective observational study, the INVOS 5100C and FORE-SIGHT were compared on 12 term newborns delivered by elective caesarean section. During the 10 min following umbilical cord clamping, cStO2 was measured simultaneously with the neonatal sensors from each device. Repeated measurements were taken the following day. RESULTS Three and 8 min after clamping, the mean cStO2 value increased from 53.4% (CI 36.8-69.9%) to 86.0% (CI 80.2-91.7%) for INVOS and from 61.6% (CI 55.4-67.8%) to 82.2% (CI 77.7-86.7%) for FORE-SIGHT. The Bland-Altman plot revealed decreasing difference (INVOS minus FORE-SIGHT) (D) in absolute values (A) with increasing cStO2 (D = 0.5A - 38.19 p = <0.001). The mean steady-state value on day two was 78.4% (CI 74.6-82.2%) and 86.2% (CI 85.0-87.4%) for INVOS and FORE-SIGHT, respectively. The within-subject standard deviation during steady-state repeated measurements was 4.8% ± 0.86 for INVOS and 2.8% ± 0.5 for FORE-SIGHT. CONCLUSION The INVOS and FORE-SIGHT cStO2 estimates showed oxygenation-level-dependent difference during birth transition. The better repeatability of FORE-SIGHT could be due to the lower response to change in saturation.","Hessel, Trine W; Hyttel-Sorensen, Simon; Greisen, Gorm",Acta paediatrica,https://doi.org/10.1111/apa.12567; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24456266/,476

Limited data exist regarding changes in heart transplant (HT). Objective To describe national and regional trends in waitlist inactivations, waitlist additions, donor recovery, and HT volume during COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants This descriptive cross-sectional study used publicly available data from the United Network for Organ Sharing and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, using 8 prespecified United Network for Organ Sharing regions. Adult (18 years or older) HT candidates listed and deceased donors recovered between January 19 to May 9, 2020. Exposures COVID-19 pandemic. Main Outcomes and Measures Changes in waitlist inactivations, waitlist additions, deceased donor recovery, and transplant volumes from the pre-COVID-19 (January 19-March 15, 2020) to the COVID-19 era (March 15-May 9, 2020). Density mapping and linear regression with interrupted time series analysis were used to characterize changes over time and changes by region. Results During the COVID-19 era, there were 600 waitlist inactivations compared with 343 during the pre-COVID era (75% increase). Waitlist additions decreased from 637 to 395 (37% reduction). These changes were most profound in the Northeast and Great Lakes regions with high rates of COVID-19. Deceased donor recovery decreased by 26% from 1878 to 1395; the most significant decrease occurred in the North Midwest despite low COVID-19 prevalence. Heart transplant volumes were significantly reduced across all regions except the Northwest. The largest decrease was seen in the Northeast where COVID-19 case rates were highest.

Conclusions and Relevance Heart transplant volumes have been significantly reduced in recent months, even in regions with a lower prevalence of COVID-19 cases. This has been accompanied by increased waitlist inactivations, decreased waitlist additions, and decreased donor recovery.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Nine tunneled hemodialysis catheters were evaluated using a mechanical model that simulated catheter conditions during a routine hemodialysis treatment. Objective and subjective determinants of catheter performance were measured and compared. Catheters were evaluated with blood lines connected in standard and reversed configurations using a fluid flow rate of 425 ml/min. RESULTS With blood lines in standard configuration the Split Cath® was the only catheter to exhibit an atypical fluid flow pattern and significant tip movement. When the blood lines were reversed, three split-tip catheters had significant tip movement. The three step-tip catheters and two symmetric tip catheters had stable fluid flow patterns and no significant tip movement with blood lines connected in standard and reverse configurations.The nine catheters had no recirculation when connected in standard configuration. When the blood lines were reversed the percentage of recirculating fluid for symmetric tip, step-tip, and split-tip catheters was 0%, 15% to 20%, and 20% to 30%, respectively. The Equistream®, Palindrome™, and Symetrex catheters had no recirculation with blood lines connected in standard or reversed configurations. CONCLUSIONS Eight of the nine catheters evaluated in this study performed well with blood lines connected in standard configuration. When blood lines were reversed, symmetric tip and step-tip designs had more stable fluid flow patterns, less tip movement and lower recirculation rates when compared to split-tip designs.","Vesely, Thomas M; Ravenscroft, Adrian",The journal of vascular access,https://doi.org/10.5301/jva.5000463; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26349860/,476

For decompression surgery addressing idiopathic S-PN entrapment, narrow-area decompression may be insufficient and long-area decompression along the S-PN from the peroneus longus muscle (PLM) to the peroneal nerve exit site may be required. To render it is less invasive, we performed S-PN neurolysis in a combined microscope/endoscope procedure. We report our surgical procedure and clinical outcomes. We microsurgically decompressed the affected S-PN under local anesthesia without a proximal tourniquet. We made a small linear skin incision at the distal portion of the S-PN, performed distal decompression of the S-PN where it penetrated the deep fascia, and then performed proximal decompression under an endoscope. At the site where the S-PN exited the PLM, we placed additional small incisions and proceeded to microscopic decompression. We surgically treated three patients with S-PN entrapment. They were two men and one woman ranging in age from 66 to 85 years. The mean postoperative follow-up was 22 months. Their symptoms before treatment and at the latest follow-up visit were recorded on the numerical rating scale (NRS). The mean incision length was 5.5 cm and 17.3 cm of the S-PN was decompressed. All three patients reported postoperative symptom improvement. There were no complications. In patients with idiopathic S-PN entrapment, long-site neurolysis under local anesthesia using a microscope/endoscope combination is useful.","Kim, Kyongsong; Isu, Toyohiko; Kokubo, Rinko; Morimoto, Daijiro; Iwamoto, Naotaka; Morita, Akio",Neurologia medico-chirurgica,https://doi.org/10.2176/nmc.oa.2020-0200; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33790130/,476

104950,"Building a new, better normal after COVID-19.",2021-06-01,"Background: Measures introduced to delay the spread of COVID-19 may result in avoidance of emergency departments (EDs) for non-COVID related illness. Clinicians and medical representative bodies such as the Irish Association for Emergency Medicine (IAEM) have expressed concern that some patients may not seek timely urgent medical intervention. Evidence from previous epidemics found that hospital avoidance during outbreaks of MERS and SARS was common. While ED attendance returned to normal following SARS and MERS, both outbreaks lasted 2-3 months. As the COVID-19 pandemic is forecast to extend into 2021, little is known about the impact COVID-19 will have on paediatric attendance at EDs as the pandemic evolves. Aims: This project aims to assess the impact of COVID-19 on paediatric emergency healthcare utilisation, to understand how the health seeking behaviour of parents may have altered due to the pandemic, and to identify how any barriers to accessing care can be removed. Methods: Administrative data records from five EDs across Ireland and one Urgent Care Centre will be analysed to identify temporal trends in attendances for emergency care. Qualitative inquiry will be utilised to capture the experience of staff providing emergency healthcare to paediatric patients during COVID-19, and their feedback on identified trends will inform the interpretation of findings. A cross-sectional survey of parents will capture experiences, concerns and decision-making on accessing healthcare for their children during the pandemic. Results and Conclusion: This information will help decision makers respond rapidly to meet the clinical needs of paediatric patients as the circumstances of the pandemic unfold and reduce the disruption to normal paediatric ED services during the onset of COVID-19. As the health of a child can deteriorate more rapidly than that of an adult, any delay in seeking care for an acutely ill child may have serious consequences.","McDonnell, Thérèse; McAuliffe, Eilish; Barrett, Michael; Conlon, Ciara; Cummins, Fergal; Deasy, Conor; Hensey, Conor; Martin, Ciara; Nicholson, Emma",HRB open research,https://doi.org/10.12688/hrbopenres.13066.2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32666040/,476

Reported here are 11 cases of COVID-19 at this hospital; all of the patients in question presented with relative bradycardia. The severity of the disease was classified into four grades. Of the patients studied, 3 with mild COVID-19 and 3 with moderate COVID-19 improved spontaneously. Lopinavir/ ritonavir was administered to 3 patients with severe COVID-19 and 2 with critical COVID-19. Both patients with critical COVID-19 required mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Both patients with critical COVID-19 had a higher fever that persisted for longer than patients with milder COVID-19.

In this article, we summarise the key features of the proposed ethical framework and subject it to critical analysis. We highlight three primary issues. First, the emphasis placed on autonomy as the primary ethical principle. We argue if ever there was a context in which autonomy should dominate the ethical analysis, this is not it. Second, we examine the interface between ethics and law which is largely overlooked in the document. Finally, we explore the surprising lack of attention paid to the concept of responsibility and communal obligations within the framework.","Elves, Charlotte Bryony; Herring, Jonathan",Journal of medical ethics,https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2020-106513; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32769094/,476

106242,COVID-19 and Undergraduates with Disabilities: Challenges Resulting from the Rapid Transition to Online Course Delivery for Students with Disabilities in Undergraduate STEM at Large-Enrollment Institutions.,2021-09-01,"In December 2019, a cluster of cases of acute respiratory illness, novel coronavirusinfected pneumonia, occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The false-negative nasopharyngeal swabs of SARS-CoV-2 caused the delayed diagnosis of COVID-19 which hindered the prevention and control of the pandemic. The transmission risk of SARS-CoV-2 in negative nasopharyngeal swabs cases were little addressed previously. This study evaluated two clusters of COVID-19 in six patients. Four of six (66.7%) showed negative RNA of SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal swabs. All epidemiological, clinical and laboratory information was collected. The first cluster was a nosocomial infection of four health care providers at early January. One of them made sequential familial cluster of infection. All patients received either selfquarantined at home or were admitted to hospital for isolated treatment. All recovered and had anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and/or IgM positive (100%) for serological detection of SARS-CoV-2 at recovery stage. Our study provides a cautionary warning that negative results of nasopharyngeal swabs of suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection can increase the risk of nosocomial infection among health care providers. Serologic detection for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and/or IgM is an important test in the assistant diagnosis of COVID-19.","Cao, Guoqing; Tang, Shaotao; Yang, Dehua; Shi, Wenjia; Wang, Xiaorong; Wang, Hua; Li, Chen; Wei, Jia; Ma, Ling",Japanese journal of infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.7883/yoken.jjid.2020.165; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32475877/,476

However, despite being able to induce depressed-like behaviors and corresponding psychophysiological changes, there is little evidence showing that the LH paradigm can produce anhedonia, a core symptom seen in all forms of depression in humans. So far a couple of studies showed that rodents bred for helplessness develop anhedonic-like behaviors in response to stress; yet, to the best of our knowledge, no similar human research has tried to investigate the direct relationship between the LH model and anhedonia. In the present study, we use a modified version of the original LH task to experimentally and temporarily induce learned helplessness in college students and then examine if the human LH paradigm induces anhedonia. We aim to 1: address the ill-defined connection between the LH model and anhedonia, and 2: directly assess helplessness in humans as opposed to the majority of non-human animal subjects used in the helplessness literature. We believe that our study will fill an important gap in the learned helplessness model literature, and will advance our understanding of the relationship between depression and perceived control, as well as place limitations to what can and cannot be inferred from non-human animal data in this topic.","Song, Xin; Vilares, Iris",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249056; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33784324/,476
107859,COVID-19 vaccine on board ships: current and future implications of seafarers.,2021,"Objective: To analyze the epidemiological characteristics of the cases firstly reported as ""asymptomatic infection of COVID-19"" in Guangdong province. Methods: The follow-up observation method was used to continuously track and observe the cases firstly reported as ""asymptomatic patients with COVID-19"" in Guangdong province from January 14 to March 31, 2020. The epidemiological data of the cases were collected to analyze their epidemiological characteristics, outcome and influencing factors. Results: From January 14 to March 31, 2020, a total of 325 cases were firstly reported as ""asymptomatic infections of COVID-19"" in Guangdong province. The epidemic curve of asymptomatic infection cases was similar to that of confirmed cases, and it had two peaks. The first peak was from January 27 to February 5, and the second peak was from March 17 to March 26. Of the 325 cases, 184 (56.6%) were subsequently converted to confirmed cases. These cases were defined as incubation period asymptomatic infection cases. The age median of the cases was 40 years, and 93.5% (172/184) of the cases showed symptoms within 3 days after the first positive nucleic acid tests were conducted, and 141 (43.4%) of the 325 cases remained asymptomatic status until they were cured and discharged. They were inapparent infection cases, accounting for 8.6% (141/1 642) of those diagnosed with COVID-19 in Guangdong province during the same period. The age median of inapparent infection cases was 27 years. The median of the interval between the first positive nucleic acid test and discharge was 14 days. Up to 90.8% (138/141) of the inapparent infection cases were discharged for centralized medical observation within 28 days. The longest interval between the first positive nucleic acid test and the last positive nucleic acid test was 73 days. The positive rate of nucleic acid test was 0.3% in close contacts of inapparent infection cases and 2.2% in close contacts of incubation period asymptomatic infection cases. There were significant differences in age distribution and source of infection between incubation period asymptomatic infection cases and inapparent infection cases (P<0.05). Old age was the risk factor for the conversion of firstly reported asymptomatic infection cases to confirmed cases. Compared with the 0-19-year-old group, The patients aged 40-59 years and 60 years and above were more likely to become confirmed cases. The OR (95%CI) values were 2.730 (1.380-5.402) and 5.302 (2.199-12.783), and P values were 0.004 and 0.000, respectively. People being infected in China were more likely to become confirmed cases (OR=7.121, P=0.000). Conclusions: There were asymptomatic infection cases among patients diagnosed with COVID-19. The infectiousness of incubation period asymptomatic infection cases might be stronger than that of inapparent infection cases. The proportion of younger cases among asymptomatic infection cases was higher than that of the confirmed cases. Old age and domestic infection were the risk factors for the conversion of asymptomatic infection cases to confirmed cases, to which more attention should be paid. Further serological investigations are needed to provide a basis for the development of COVID-19 prevention and control strategies.","Xie, S L; Huang, J H; Liu, J; Liu, J; Long, Q S; Xie, X; Liao, Y H; Tang, L L; Liang, W J; Zhong, H J; Li, Y",Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20200423-00633; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33076590/,476

METHODS The epidemiology, clinical symptoms, laboratory and radiologic data of 23 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Fifth People's Hospital of Xinyang City from January 22nd to January 29th, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS There was 23 patients with COVID-19, with 15 men and 8 women, and the median age was 46.0 (40.5, 52.0) years old (ranged from 27 years old to 80 years old). Nine patients had basic disease (39.1%), including hypertension (17.4%), cardiovascular diseases (17.4%), diabetes (8.7%), hypothyroidism (4.3%) and past history of tuberculosis (4.3%). All the 23 patients had contact history in Wuhan area or with confirmed cases. Clinical symptoms included fever (100%), cough (69.6%), expectoration (43.5%), myalgia (26.1%), headache (17.4%) and dyspnea (17.4%), and the less common symptom was diarrhea (4.3%). Blood routine tests showed leukocytopenia in 11 patients (47.8%), normal leukocyte counts in 10 patients (43.5%), and leukocytosis in 2 patients (8.7%); lymphopenia was found in 13 patients (56.5%). All 23 patients had different degrees of infective lesions in chest CT, with 7 patients (30.4%) on one side and 16 patients (69.6%) on both sides. There were 19 mild patients, 4 severe patients, and no critical or death case. Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (17.4%). No patient was reported with liver, kidney or heart dysfunction or secondary infection. CONCLUSIONS Epidemic history of contact, fever, pneumonia signs of chest CT, normal or decreased count of leukocyte and lymphopenia are the clinical basis for diagnosis of COVID-19.

METHODS We evaluated 126 benign non-functioning thyroid nodules of 111 patients treated with RF ablation and followed-up more than 3 years. RF ablation was performed using the Cool-Tip RF system and an internally cooled electrode. Nodule volume and cosmetic and symptom scores were evaluated before treatment and during follow-up. Complications and factors related to efficacy were evaluated. RESULTS The mean follow-up duration was 49.4 ± 13.6 months. Thyroid nodule volume decreased significantly, from 9.8 ± 8.5 ml before ablation to 0.9 ± 3.3 ml (P < 0.001) at final evaluation: a mean volume reduction of 93.4 ± 11.7 %. The mean cosmetic (P < 0.001) and symptom scores (P < 0.001) improved significantly. Factors related to efficacy were initial solidity and volume. The overall recurrence rate was 5.6 % (7/126). The overall complication rate was 3.6 % (4/111). CONCLUSIONS RF ablation was effective in shrinking benign thyroid nodules and in controlling nodule-related problems over a 4-year follow-up. There were no life-threatening complications or sequelae. Therefore, RF ablation can be used as a non-surgical treatment for patients with benign non-functioning thyroid nodules.","Lim, Hyun Kyung; Lee, Jeong Hyun; Ha, Eun Ju; Sung, Jin Young; Kim, Jae Kyun; Baek, Jung Hwan",European radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-012-2671-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23096937/,476

Resistance training (RT) is a potential intervention to improve LBM, metabolic fitness, and reduce risk of cardiovascular disease. PROCEDURE Eligible participants ages 13-39 years, 80-120 days post-HCT, transfusion independent, and prednisone dose ≤1 mg/kg/day were approached. Baseline assessments of body composition (DXA), anthropometrics, and strength testing were completed and participants were taught a 12-week, home-based RT intervention with weekly remote coaching. Follow-up assessments were at day +200 (FU1) and +365 post-HCT (FU2). Feasibility targets were (a) 60% enrollment of approached patients, (b) 80% completion of weekly phone calls, and (c) 80% completion of the RT intervention and FU1 assessments. Acceptability was based on positive responses in qualitative interviews. RESULTS Twenty of 31 (65%) eligible AYAs enrolled. Three participants failed to complete baseline measurements (2 = scheduling barriers, 1 = passive refusal) and four participants who completed baseline assessments did not receive the intervention (1 = medical reasons, 2 = no longer interested). Of those who completed baseline assessments, 13 received the intervention, completed 88.5% of coaching calls, and 11 (65%) completed FU1. LBM (kg) increased or remained unchanged in nine of nine participants with complete body composition data at FU1 (mean 1.1 kg; 95%CI: 0.4, 1.9). All participants who completed FU1 reported they would recommend the intervention to an AYA HCT survivor. CONCLUSIONS A home-based RT intervention in AYA HCT survivors early post HCT is both feasible and acceptable and may maintain or increase LBM.","Ketterl, Tyler G; Ballard, Sheri; Bradford, Miranda C; Chow, Eric J; Jenssen, Kari; Myers, Sam; Rosenberg, Abby R; Van Doren, Matt; Baker, K Scott",Pediatric blood & cancer,https://doi.org/10.1002/pbc.29206; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34260139/,476

METHODS This study is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data. From 1994 to 2017, 535 laparoscopic adrenalectomies (LA) were performed. One hundred and sixty-four patients with Conn's or Cushing's syndrome underwent left LA. Patients were divided in three groups based on the approach: LT (Group A), AT (Group B) and ATS (Group C). RESULTS The diagnosis was Conn's and Cushing's syndrome in 99 and 65 patients, respectively. LT was used in 13 cases, AT in 55 and ATS in 96. No significant differences in patient's gender, age and BMI were observed. Mean operative time was 117.6 ± 33.7, 107.6 ± 40.3 and 96.2 ± 47.5 min for Groups A, B and C, respectively. Conversion to open surgery was observed in 4 Group C patients (4.1%). Morbidity occurred in 2 Group B (2%) and in 5 Group C patients (5.2%). CONCLUSIONS In case of Conn's or Cushing's syndrome, left LA with ATS approach is equally safe and effective as compared to the LT and AT approaches. Early control of the adrenal vein with minimal gland manipulation and limited surgical dissection are the major advantages of the submesocolic approach. Even if statistically significant differences are not observed, postoperative results are the same as those reported in the literature with other approaches.","Balla, Andrea; Quaresima, Silvia; Palmieri, Livia; Ortenzi, Monica; Sbardella, Emilia; Puliani, Giulia; Isidori, Andrea M; Guerrieri, Mario; Paganini, Alessandro M",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-018-6601-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30456505/,476

It is thought to arise from a remnant of the embryologic foregut. The solitary cysts are characterised by ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium. They are usually located above the diaphragm but they can also arise in relation to the liver, gallbladder and pancreas. PRESENTATION OF CASE We present the first ciliated foregut cyst of the gallbladder case reported in Australia, and the ninth known case to be reported worldwide. A 61-year-old male with chronic cholecystitis and cholelithiasis underwent an elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy and intraoperative cholangiogram. Intraoperatively, 'out-pouching' was noted on the lateral border of the gallbladder. Microscopically the histopathology showed that the cyst was lined by ciliated columnar epithelium the characteristic feature of a ciliated foregut cyst. DISCUSSION To date only 8 cases of these ciliated foregut cysts in the gallbladder have been reported in literature. Our case is the first reported in Australia. It is unique in that the patient was an older male as opposed to most other previous cases, which were younger females. These cysts can be difficult to distinguish from neoplasms clinically and radiographically. Reports have shown that these cysts may become dysplastic and is best excised when discovered. CONCLUSION Despite the rarity of CFCs and their potential to mimic malignancy, we propose awareness and understanding of the management for them-being excision and hopefully not cause any confusion or devastatingly allow it to become malignant.","Lee, Mee-Jin; Salinas, James; Varikatthas, Winny; Alsnih, Ghiyath",International journal of surgery case reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2016.01.023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26890682/,476

However, the therapeutic mechanism of the effect of HSBDF on COVID-19 remains unclear. METHODS The components and action targets of HSBDF were searched in the TCMSP, YaTCM, PubChem, and TargetNet databases. Disease targets related to ACE2 were screened in single-cell sequence data of colon epithelial cells from other reports. The therapeutic targets of HSBDF for COVID-19 were obtained by integrated analysis, and the protein-protein interaction was analyzed using the STRING database. The Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) processes were analyzed using the OmicsBean and Metascape databases. The communication between networks [component-target (C-T) network, component-target-pathway (C-T-P) network, herb-target (H-T) network, target-pathway (T-P) network, and meridian-tropism (M-T) network] was constructed by Cytoscape software. The Cloud computing molecular docking platform was used to verify the molecular docking. RESULTS The obtained 223 active ingredients and 358 targets of HSBDF. The 5,555 COVID-19 disease targets related to ACE2 were extracted, and 84 compound-disease common targets were found, of which the principal targets included ACE, ESR1, ADRA1A, and HDAC1. A total of 3,946 items were seized by GO enrichment analysis, mainly related to metabolism, protein binding, cellular response to the stimulus, and receptor activity. The enriched KEGG pathways screened 46 signaling pathways, including the reninangiotensin system, the renin secretion, NF-kappa B pathway, the arachidonic acid metabolism, and the AMPK signaling pathway. The molecular docking results showed that the bioactive components of HSBDF have an excellent binding ability with main proteins related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). CONCLUSIONS HSBDF might act on SARS-CoV-2 through multiple components, targets, and pathways. Here we reveal preliminary results of the mechanism of action of HSBDF on SARS-CoV-2, providing a theoretical basis for future clinical applications.","Cai, Yu; Zeng, Min; Chen, Yun-Zhong",Annals of palliative medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/apm-20-1759; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33691446/,476

Three groups of clinical and MRI outcomes of complete (CR), partial (PR) and no response (NR) were defined. A weighted-kappa statistic was used to assess for agreement. Results Clinical responses were CR in 34/43 (79.1%, 95%CI: 64.0-90.0%), PR in 8/43 (18.6%) and NR in 1/43 (2.3%) patients. All 19/32 patients with MRI CR experienced clinical CR. One patient with MRI NR had clinical NR. All 7/32 patients with clinical PR had MRI PR. All 4/43 complications were in MRI PR or NR groups. Substantial agreement was observed between MRI and clinical outcomes (kappa:0.69, 95%CI:0.45-0.95). MRI helped determine etiologies in all symptomatic patients and their management (n=8). Conclusions MRI is recommended for symptomatic patients after ablation.","Maybody, Majid; Soliman, Mohamed M; Hwang, Sinchun; Gonzalez-Aguirre, Adrian; Martin, Ernesto G Santos; Kaye, Elena; Hsu, Meier; Moskowitz, Chaya; Healey, John H; Fabbri, Nicola",SN comprehensive clinical medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s42399-020-00514-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33235978/,476

This study aimed to determine how microRNAs (miRNAs) and predicted targeted transcripts were altered in livers of zebrafish exposed to these stressors, and livers of their un-exposed F1 and F2 offspring. Following a 21 day exposure to multiple stressors (1 μg/L VFX, +5 °C ambient, 50% O2), then a subsequent 21 day recovery, relative abundances of cyp3a65, hsp70, hsp90, and ppargc1a and miRNAs predicted to target them (miR-142a, miR-16c, miR-181c, and miR-129, respectively) were measured in the liver via quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). There were significant decreases in miR-142a in the exposed F0 generation and the exposed F1 generation. While there were no changes detected in cyp3a65 relative abundance, there was a significant inverse relationship between cyp3a65 and miR-142a. Hsp70 expression significantly increased in the F1 generation, which persisted to the F2 generation and the relative abundance of hsp90 significantly increased in all generations. There was a significant reduction in miR-181c in the F1 generation, but there was no significant relationship between miR-181c and hsp90. Finally, there was a significant decrease in ppargc1a relative abundance in the F1 generation which was associated with an increase in miR-129. Combined, these results suggest that parental exposure to multiple, environmentally relevant stressors can confer transcriptional and epigenetic responses in the F1 and F2 generations, although identifying which stressor is a driving force becomes unclear.","Luu, Ivy; Ikert, Heather; Craig, Paul M",Comparative biochemistry and physiology.

It Hasn't All Been Bad on Reflection.",2020-10-15,"Many of the clinical manifestations of hyperthyroidism are due to the ability of thyroid hormones to alter myocardial contractility and cardiovascular hemodynamics, leading to cardiovascular impairment. In contrast, recent studies highlight also the potential beneficial effects of thyroid hormone administration for clinical or preclinical treatment of different diseases such as atherosclerosis, obesity and diabetes or as a new therapeutic approach in demyelinating disorders. In these contexts and in the view of developing thyroid hormone-based therapeutic strategies, it is, however, important to analyze undesirable secondary effects on the heart. Animal models of experimentally induced hyperthyroidism therefore represent important tools for investigating and monitoring changes of cardiac function. In our present study we use high-field cardiac MRI to monitor and follow-up longitudinally the effects of prolonged thyroid hormone (triiodothyronine) administration focusing on murine left ventricular function. Using a 9.4 T small horizontal bore animal scanner, cinematographic MRI was used to analyze changes in ejection fraction, wall thickening, systolic index and fractional shortening. Cardiac MRI investigations were performed after sustained cycles of triiodothyronine administration and treatment arrest in adolescent (8 week old) and adult (24 week old) female C57Bl/6 N mice. Triiodothyronine supplementation of 3 weeks led to an impairment of cardiac performance with a decline in ejection fraction, wall thickening, systolic index and fractional shortening in both age groups but with a higher extent in the group of adolescent mice. However, after a hormonal treatment cessation of 3 weeks, only young mice are able to partly restore cardiac performance in contrast to adult mice lacking this recovery potential and therefore indicating a presence of chronically developed heart pathology.","Hübner, Neele Saskia; Merkle, Annette; Jung, Bernd; von Elverfeldt, Dominik; Harsan, Laura-Adela",NMR in biomedicine,https://doi.org/10.1002/nbm.3233; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25394338/,476

119592,What's next for COVID-19 apps? Governance and oversight.,2020-11-13,"BACKGROUND In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services pledged payment for telehealth visits for the duration of this public health emergency in an effort to decrease COVID-19 transmission and allow for deployment of residents and attending physicians to support critical-care services. Although the COVID-19 pandemic has vastly expanded telehealth use, no studies to our knowledge have analyzed the implementation and success of telehealth for orthopaedic trauma. This population is unique in that patients who have experienced orthopaedic trauma range in age from early childhood to late adulthood, they vary across the socioeconomic spectrum, may need to undergo emergent or urgent surgery, often have impaired mobility, and, historically, do not always follow-up consistently with healthcare providers. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES (1) To what extent did telehealth usage increase for an outpatient orthopaedic trauma clinic at a Level 1 trauma center from the month before the COVID-19 stay-at-home order compared with the month immediately following the order? (2) What is the proportion of no-show visits before and after the implementation of telehealth? METHODS After nonurgent clinic visits were postponed, telehealth visits were offered to all patients due to the COVID-19 stay-at-home order. Patients with internet access who had the ability to download the MyChart application on their mobile device and agreed to a telehealth visit were seen virtually between March 16, 2020 and April 10, 2020 (COVID-19) by three attending orthopaedic trauma surgeons at a large, urban, Level 1 trauma center. Clinic schedules and patient charts were reviewed to determine clinical volumes and no-show proportions. The COVID-19 period was compared with the 4 weeks before March 16, 2020 (pre-COVID-19), when all visits were conducted in-person. The overall clinic volume decreased from 340 to 233 (31%) between the two periods. The median (range) age of telehealth patients was 46 years (20 to 89). Eighty-four percent (72 of 86) of telehealth visits were postoperative and established nonoperative patient visits, and 16% (14 of 86) were new-patient visits. To avoid in-person suture or staple removal, patients seen for their 2-week postoperative visit had either absorbable closures, staples, or nonabsorbable sutures removed by a home health registered nurse or skilled nursing facility registered nurse. If radiographs were indicated, they were obtained at outside facilities or our institution before patients returned home for their telehealth visit. RESULTS There was an increase in the percentage of office visits conducted via telehealth between the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods (0% [0 of 340] versus 37% [86 of 233]; p < 0.001), and by the third week of implementation, telehealth comprised approximately half of all clinic visits (57%; [30 of 53]). There was no difference in the no-show proportion between the two periods (13% [53 of 393] for the pre-COVID-19 period and 14% [37 of 270] for the COVID-19 period; p = 0.91). CONCLUSIONS Clinicians should consider implementing telehealth strategies to provide high-quality care for patients and protect the workforce during a pandemic. In a previously telehealth-naïve clinic, we show successful implementation of telehealth for a diverse orthopaedic trauma population that historically has issues with mobility and follow-up. Our strategies include postponing long-term follow-up visits, having sutures or staples removed by a home health or skilled nursing facility registered nurse, having patients obtain pertinent imaging before the visit, and ensuring that patients have access to mobile devices and internet connectivity. Future studies should evaluate the incidence of missed infections or stiffness as a result of telehealth, analyze the subset of patients who may be more vulnerable to no-shows or technological failures, and conduct patient surveys to determine the factors that contribute to patient preferences for or against the use of telehealth.

120230,The Impact of COVID-19 within Academic Settings: A High-Speed Pivot.,2020-09-01,"BACKGROUND Access to washroom facilities and a place to dispose of menstrual waste are prerequisites for optimal menstrual hygiene management in schools. Like other low- and middle-income countries, Bangladeshi schools lack facilities for girls to change and dispose of their menstrual absorbents. We explored existing systems for disposing of menstrual absorbent wastes in urban and rural schools of Bangladesh and assessed the feasibility and acceptability of alternative disposal options. METHODS We explored how girls dispose of their menstrual products, identified girls' preferences and choices for a disposal system and piloted four disposal options in four different schools. We then implemented one preferred option in four additional schools. We explored girls', teachers', and janitors' perspectives and evaluated the acceptability, feasibility, and potential for sustainability of the piloted disposal system. RESULTS Barriers to optimal menstrual hygiene management included lack of functional toilets and private locations for changing menstrual products, and limited options for disposal. Girls, teachers, and janitors preferred and ranked the chute disposal system as their first choice, because it has large capacity (765 L), is relatively durable, requires less maintenance, and will take longer time to fill. During implementation of the chute disposal system in four schools, girls, teachers, and janitors reported positive changes in toilet cleanliness and menstrual products disposal resulting from the intervention. CONCLUSIONS The chute disposal system for menstrual products is a durable option that does not require frequent emptying or regular maintenance, and is accepted by schoolgirls and janitors alike, and can improve conditions for menstrual hygiene management in schools. However, regular supervision, motivation of girls to correctly dispose of their products, and a long-term maintenance and management plan for the system are necessary.","Jahan, Farjana; Nuruzzaman, Md; Sultana, Farhana; Mahfuz, Mehjabin Tishan; Rahman, Mahbubur; Akhand, Farhana; Luby, Stephen P; Unicomb, Leanne; Winch, Peter J",BMC public health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-020-09413-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894120/,476

DESIGN This is a mixed (qualitative and quantitative) prospective study of intervention efficacy, measured in terms of usability related to effectiveness, efficiency, satisfaction, and degree of community engagement. SETTING Two municipalities in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico are included. PARTICIPANTS Community members consisting of individuals; traditional leaders; federal, territorial, and municipal emergency managers; municipal mayors; National Guard; territorial departments of education, health, housing, public works, and transportation; health care; police; Emergency Medical Services; faith-based organizations; nongovernmental organizations (NGOs); and the private sector. INTERVENTION The intervention included four community convenings: one for risk communication; two for plan-writing; and one tabletop exercise (TTX). This study analyzed data collected from the project work plan; participant rosters; participant surveys; workshop outputs; and focus group interviews. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Efficacy was measured in terms of ISO 9241-11, an international standard for usability that includes effectiveness, efficiency, user satisfaction, and ""freedom from risk"" among users. Degree of engagement was considered an indicator of ""freedom from risk,"" measurable through workshop attendance. RESULTS Two separate communities drafted and exercised ~60-page-long population protection plans, each within 14.5 hours. Plan-writing workshops completed 100% of plan objectives and activities. Efficiency rates were nearly the same in both communities. Interviews and surveys indicated high degrees of community satisfaction. Engagement was consistent among community members and variable among governmental officials. CONCLUSIONS Frontline communities have successfully demonstrated the ability to understand the environmental health hazards in their own community; rapidly write consensus-based plans for PPMs; participate in an objective-based TTX; and perform these activities in a bi-lingual setting. This intervention appears to be efficacious for public use in the rapid development of community-based PPMs.","Keim, Mark E; Runnels, Laura A; Lovallo, Alexander P; Pagan Medina, Margarita; Roman Rosa, Eduardo; Ramery Santos, Maximiliano; Mahany, Mollie; Cruz, Miguel A",Prehospital and disaster medicine,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1049023x20001429; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33239123/,476

The clinical manifestations of arboviral diseases, especially dengue fever, can be very similar to COVID-19, and misdiagnoses are still a reality. In the meantime, outcomes for patients and healthcare systems in situations of possible syndemic have not yet been clarified. OBJECTIVE We set out to conduct a systematic review to understand and summarize the evidence relating to clinical manifestations, disease severity and prognoses among patients coinfected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and arboviruses. METHODS We conducted a rapid systematic review with meta-analysis, on prospective and retrospective cohorts, case-control studies and case series of patients with confirmed diagnoses of SARS-CoV-2 and arboviral infection. We followed the Cochrane Handbook recommendations. We searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, LILACS, Scopus and Web of Science to identify published, ongoing and unpublished studies. We planned to extract data and assess the risk of bias and the certainty of evidence of the studies included, using the Quality in Prognosis Studies tool and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment.

A Review of Studies.,2020-09-28,"INTRODUCTION The CoronaVirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic remains a formidable threat to populations around the world. The U.S. Military, in particular, represents a unique and distinguishable subset of the population, primarily due to the age and gender of active duty personnel. Current investigations have focused on health outcome forecasts for civilian populations, making them of limited value for military planning. MATERIALS AND METHODS We have developed and applied an age-structured susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered, or dead compartmental model for both civilian and military populations, driven by estimates of the time-dependent reproduction number, R(t), which can be both fit to available data and also forecast future cases, intensive care unit (ICU) patients, and deaths. RESULTS We show that the expected health outcomes for active duty military populations are substantially different than for civilian populations of the same size. Specifically, while the number of cases is not expected to differ dramatically, severity, both in terms of ICU burdens and deaths, is substantially lower. CONCLUSIONS Our results confirm that the burden placed on military health centers will be substantially lower than that for equivalent-sized civilian populations. More practically, the tool we have developed to investigate this (https://q.predsci.com/covid19/) can be used by military health planners to estimate the resources needed in particular locations based on current estimates of the transmission profiles of COVID-19 within the surrounding civilian population in which the military installation is embedded. As this tool continues to be developed, it can be used to assess the likely impact of different intervention strategies, as well as vaccine policies; both for the current pandemic as well as future ones.","Riley, Pete; Ben-Nun, Michal; Turtle, James; Bacon, David; Owens, Akeisha N; Riley, Steven",Military medicine,https://doi.org/10.1093/milmed/usab404; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34632512/,476

However, the theoretical aspects and polysemous character of social justice as applied in the field of public health are often assumed rather than explicitly explained. An intersectional justice approach to understanding health inequality, inequity, and injustice might be useful. It argues that preexisting class-, race/ethnicity-, and gender-based health injustice and the socially differentiated impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are shaped, interconnectedly, by economic maldistribution, cultural misrecognition, and political misrepresentation. Pursuing health justice requires analyses, strategies, and interventions that integrate the economic, cultural, and political spheres of redistribution, recognition, and representation, respectively. Such an intersectional approach to health justice is even more relevant and compelling in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. This article is broadly about class, race/ethnicity, and gender political economy of public health-but with a narrower focus on maldistribution, misrecognition, and misrepresentation, shaping social and health injustices.","Borras, Arnel M","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",https://doi.org/10.1177/0020731420981857; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33356774/,476

DESIGN Cross-sectional analysis of an anonymous survey sent via text message link to personal cell phones and emails. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS Nursing home and assisted living facility staff in Indiana. MEASURES Staff characteristics including age, gender, race, ethnicity, role in the facility, experience in long-term care, and geographic location of facility were self-reported along with prior infection and willingness to receive an approved vaccine as soon as it is available. Responses were weighted to represent staff statewide. Weighted frequencies and logit regression estimated characteristics associated with vaccine willingness. RESULTS There were 8,243 responses to the survey. For nursing home staff (survey delivered via 23,232 working phone numbers), there was a 33% response rate). There were 2,372 (29%) in nurse aide or similar roles and 1,602 nurses providing direct clinical care (19%). Overall, 45% of respondents indicated they would receive an approved COVID-19 vaccine as soon as available. Of those unwilling to take the vaccine when first available, 44% would consider in the future. Concerns about side effects was the primary reason for vaccine hesitancy (70%). Characteristics associated with increased willingness were age over 60, male, and white race (p<0.0001). No statistically significant differences were observed among staff self-reporting prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS The willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine immediately or in the future may be as high as 69%, but varies among subgroups of nursing home staff which has implications for distribution. Educating staff on the vaccine may be critical for increasing uptake. Widespread vaccination holds the promise of protection against serious illness and death and a return of visitors and activities that support improved quality of life. This promise will not be realized without strong uptake of the vaccines. This article is protected by copyright.

127394,Psychological safeguards for Chinese People's Liberation Army fighting COVID-19.,2020-08-04,"Most visual analytics systems assume that all foraging for data happens before the analytics process; once analysis begins, the set of data attributes considered is fixed. Such separation of data construction from analysis precludes iteration that can enable foraging informed by the needs that arise in-situ during the analysis. The separation of the foraging loop from the data analysis tasks can limit the pace and scope of analysis. In this paper, we present CAVA, a system that integrates data curation and data augmentation with the traditional data exploration and analysis tasks, enabling information foraging in-situ during analysis. Identifying attributes to add to the dataset is difficult because it requires human knowledge to determine which available attributes will be helpful for the ensuing analytical tasks. CAVA crawls knowledge graphs to provide users with a a broad set of attributes drawn from external data to choose from. Users can then specify complex operations on knowledge graphs to construct additional attributes. CAVA shows how visual analytics can help users forage for attributes by letting users visually explore the set of available data, and by serving as an interface for query construction. It also provides visualizations of the knowledge graph itself to help users understand complex joins such as multi-hop aggregations. We assess the ability of our system to enable users to perform complex data combinations without programming in a user study over two datasets.

127580,Conducting clinical surgical examinations in Timor-Leste during the COVID-19 global pandemic.,2020-12-01,"BACKGROUND Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy has recently become the recommended approach for stage I non-small cell lung cancer. However, these guidelines are not based on any large randomized control trial. Our study used propensity scores and a sensitivity analysis to compare VATS lobectomy with open thoracotomy. METHODS From 2005 to 2012, 24,811 patients (95.1%) were operated on by open thoracotomy and 1,278 (4.9%) by VATS. The end points were 30-day postoperative death, postoperative complications, hospital stay, overall survival, and disease-free survival. Two propensity scores analyses were performed: matching and inverse probability of treatment weighting, and one sensitivity analysis to unmask potential hidden bias. A subgroup analysis was performed to compare ""high-risk"" with ""low-risk"" patients. Results are reported by odds ratios or hazard ratios and their 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS Postoperative death was not significantly reduced by VATS whatever the analysis. Concerning postoperative complications, VATS significantly decreased the occurrence of atelectasis and pneumopathy with both analysis methods, but there were no differences in the occurrence of other postoperative complications. VATS did not provide a benefit for high-risk patients. The VATS approach decreased the hospital length of stay from 2.4 days (95% confidence interval, -1.7 to -3 days) to -4.68 days (95% confidence interval, -8.5 to 0.9 days). Overall survival and disease-free survival were not influenced by the surgical approach. The sensitivity analysis showed potential biases. CONCLUSIONS The results must be interpreted carefully because of the differences observed according to the propensity scores method used. A multicenter randomized controlled trial is necessary to limit the biases.","Pagès, Pierre-Benoit; Delpy, Jean-Philippe; Orsini, Bastien; Gossot, Dominique; Baste, Jean-Marc; Thomas, Pascal; Dahan, Marcel; Bernard, Alain",The Annals of thoracic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.athoracsur.2015.10.105; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26872732/,476

This qualitative study aimed to explore parental perspectives regarding the care for sleep of their young child (age 1-8 years) with CP.Materials and methods: Individual, semi-structured interviews were conducted with eighteen parents of a child with CP (GMFCS levels I-V). Inductive thematic analysis of the data was performed within each of the three preidentified domains: 1) Current situation; 2) Concerns; 3) Needs.Results: In total, sixteen themes were identified across the three domains. Within the families' Current situation, parents expressed various issues concerning the care for sleep of their child both at night and during daytime, which are hampered by perceived deficiencies in healthcare, such as limited attention for sleep and lack of knowledge among health professionals. Themes within the Concerns and Needs domains encompassed experiences in the home environment relating to child, family and social aspects, while experiences in the healthcare setting included clinical practices and attitudes of healthcare professionals, as well as the broader organisation of care for sleep.Conclusions: Parents face numerous challenges caring for their child's sleep and the burden placed on families by sleep problems is underappreciated. In order to break the vicious circle of sleep problems and their disastrous consequences on the wellbeing of families, we need to wake up to parent-identified issues and shortcomings in healthcare. Care for sleep should be integrated into paediatric rehabilitation through routine inquiries, using a family-centered and multidisciplinary approach.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONThe heavy burden placed on families by sleep problems in children with cerebral palsy warrants acknowledgement in paediatric healthcare.Sleep should be routinely addressed by clinicians during health assessments using a family-centered, and multidisciplinary approach.Healthcare professionals ought to adopt a proactive, understanding, and non-judgmental attitude when addressing sleep problems.Future research should focus on developing sleep intervention strategies that take into account the diverse parental concerns and needs unique to each family situation.","Hulst, Raquel Y; Voorman, Jeanine M; Pillen, Sigrid; Ketelaar, Marjolijn; Visser-Meily, Johanna M A; Verschuren, Olaf",Disability and rehabilitation,https://doi.org/10.1080/09638288.2020.1770873; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32530772/,476

131058,Assessment of COVID-19 control strategies in a steel industry using SWOT matrix.,2021-05-11,"PURPOSE A late increased mortality risk has been reported in a summary level meta-analysis of patients with femoropopliteal artery occlusive disease treated with paclitaxel-coated angioplasty balloons and stents. However, at the longer follow up timepoints that analysis was limited by small trial numbers and few participants. The aim of this study was to report an updated summary level risk of all-cause mortality after treatment with paclitaxel-coated devices in that same patient group. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to investigate the mortality outcomes associated with paclitaxel-coated devices used to treat patients with occlusive disease of femoropopliteal arteries (last search date December 10, 2020). The single primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. RESULTS We identified 34 randomized controlled trials (7654 patients; 84% intermittent claudication). There were 622 deaths among 4147 (15.0%) subjects in the paclitaxel device group and 475 deaths among 3507 (13.5%) subjects in the noncoated control group [relative risk ratio (RR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 1.20, p=0.20, I2=0%). All-cause mortality was similar between groups at 12 months (34 studies, 7654 patients; RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.22, p=0.94, I2=0%), 24 months (20 studies, 3799 patients; RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.55, p=0.31, I2=0%), and 60 months (9 studies, 2288 patients; RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.45, p=0.08, I2=0%). CONCLUSION This updated meta-analysis with included additional trials and larger patient numbers shows no evidence of increased risk of all-cause mortality in patients treated with paclitaxel-coated devices, compared with uncoated devices for femoropopliteal disease at all time points to 60 months. There is therefore no justification to limit their use, or alter regulatory body follow-up recommendations in this patient population.

It has been an area of prominent and growing importance from both research and deployment perspectives. Nonetheless, it is necessary to realize that the use of algorithms, methodology, as well as the source of medical image data, must be strictly scrutinized. As the COVID-19 pandemic has been gripping much of the world recently, there has been much efforts gone into developing affordable testing for the masses, and it has been shown that the established and widely available chest x-rays (CXR) images may be used as a screening criteria for assistive diagnosis purpose. Thanks to the dedicated work by various individuals and organizations, publicly available CXR of COVID-19 subjects are available for analytic usage. We have also provided a publicly available CXR dataset on the Kaggle platform.

135212,"Covid-19: Fauci awarded for ""unprecedented public service"" while Trump fires more insults.",2020-10-20,"The boreal forest is among the largest terrestrial biomes on earth, storing more carbon (C) than the atmosphere. Due to rapid climatic warming and enhanced human development, the boreal region may have begun transitioning from a net C sink to a net source. This raises serious concern that old biogenic soil C can be re-introduced into the modern C cycle in near future. Combining bio-decay experiments, mixing models and the Keeling plot method, we discovered a distinct old pre-bomb organic carbon fraction with high biodegradation rate. In total, 34 ± 12% of water-extractable organic carbon (WEOC) in podzols, one of the dominating boreal soil types, consisted of aged (~ 1000 year) labile C. The omission of this aged (i.e., Δ14C depleted) WEOC fraction in earlier studies is due to the co-occurrence with Δ14C enriched modern C formed following 1950s nuclear bomb testing masking its existence. High lability of aged soil WEOC and masking effects of modern Δ14C enriched C suggests that the risk for mobilization and re-introduction of this ancient C pool into the modern C cycle has gone undetected. Our findings have important implications for earth systems models in terms of climate-carbon feedbacks and the future C balance of the boreal forest.","Hensgens, Geert; Laudon, Hjalmar; Johnson, Mark S; Berggren, Martin",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85506-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33737556/,476

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the number of computed tomography (CT) critical test results in the ED. METHODS We performed a retrospective observational study of ED CT usage at 4 Ontario hospitals (1 urban academic, 1 northern academic, 1 urban community and 1 rural community) over 1 month during the COVID-19 pandemic (April 2020) and over the same month 1 year earlier (April 2019; before the pandemic). The CT findings from 1 of the 4 hospitals, Hamilton Health Sciences, were reviewed to determine the number of critical test results by body region. Total CT numbers were compared using Poisson regression and CT yields were compared using the χ2 test. RESULTS The median number of ED CT examinations per day was markedly lower during the COVID-19 pandemic than before the pandemic (82 v. 133, p < 0.01), with variation across hospitals (p = 0.001). On review of 1717 CT reports from Hamilton Health Sciences, fewer critical test results were demonstrated on CT pulmonary angiograms (43 v. 88, p < 0.001) and CT examinations of the head (82 v. 112, p < 0.03) during the pandemic than before the pandemic; however, the yield of these examinations did not change. Although the absolute number of all CT examinations with critical test results decreased, the number of CT examinations without critical results decreased more, resulting in a higher yield of CT for critical test results during the pandemic (46% [322/696] v. 37% [379/1021], p < 0.01). INTERPRETATION Emergency department CT volumes markedly decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, predominantly because there were fewer examinations with new or unexpected findings. This suggests that COVID-19 public information campaigns influenced the behaviours of patients presenting to the ED.","Agarwal, Minu; Udare, Amar; Patlas, Michael; Ramonas, Milita; Alaref, Amer A; Rozenberg, Radu; Ly, Donald L; Golev, Dmitry S; Mascola, Ken; van der Pol, Christian B",CMAJ open,https://doi.org/10.9778/cmajo.20200148; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32928878/,476

To evaluate HA as a potential immunization site, the immune responses were compared when HA and the conventional site nape were vaccinated in rats. The results showed that injection of a porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) vaccine in HA induced significantly higher IgG, IgG1, IgG2, splenocyte proliferation and mRNA expression of IL-2, IL-4 and IFN-γ than in the nape. To search for the underlying mechanisms, the draining lymph nodes for HA and the nape were investigated. When rats were injected in HA with Indian ink, 11 lymph nodes including caudal mesenteric lymph node and bilateral gluteal lymph nodes, posterior inguinal lymph nodes, lumbar lymph nodes, internal iliac lymph nodes and popliteal lymph nodes were visibly stained with the ink and injection of a model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) in HA resulted in detection of OVA by western blotting while in the same lymph nodes only a pair of lymph nodes (central brachial lymph nodes) were observed when Indian ink or OVA was injected in the nape. IL-2 mRNA expression was detected in all the lymph nodes when PEDV vaccine was injected. Therefore, the enhanced immune response elicited by vaccination in HA may be attributed to more lymphocytes activated.","Jin, Haibo; Wu, Ye; Bi, Shicheng; Xu, Ye; Shi, Fushan; Li, Xiaoliang; Ma, Xiaodan; Hu, Songhua",Research in veterinary science,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2020.03.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32224352/,476

MATERIALS AND METHODS This is a prospective randomized study comparing two groups of patients who underwent LSG. In one group LSG was performed with a running absorbable suture placement at the staple line. In the other group the running suture was not placed. General data of the patients, as well as intraoperative and postoperative data, were gathered and statistically analyzed. RESULTS Overall, 146 patients were subjected to LSG. In 84 patients a running suture was placed, and in 62 patients no suture was placed. No significant differences were found between the two groups in demographic data. No significant differences were found also in the intraoperative data, such as number of trocars, number and type of cartridges, drain placement, and operative time (45±21 versus 40±20 minutes, respectively; P<.05). Intraoperative complications were significantly more in the group with the suture placement (33.3% versus 16.1%, respectively; P<.05). Hematomas developed intraoperatively in more patients after the placement of the running suture (9.5% versus 0.0%, respectively; P<.05). Postoperatively, there was no significant difference in morbidity between the two groups (8.3% versus 9.7%, respectively; P>.05). CONCLUSIONS After this randomized study, final conclusions about the efficacy of this running suture to the staple line cannot be made. To the contrary, problems seem to exist after such reinforcement of the staple line, such as hematomas. Dealing with possible leaks and hemorrhage of the staple line is also problematic after placement of the running suture.","Albanopoulos, Konstantinos; Tsamis, Dimitrios; Arapaki, Aggeliki; Kleidi, Eleftheria; Zografos, Georgios; Leandros, Emmanouil",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

The incision and temporalis muscle dissection impacts postoperative recovery and cosmetic outcomes. The minipterional (MPT) craniotomy offers similar microsurgical corridors, with a substantially shorter incision, less muscle dissection, and a smaller craniotomy flap. OBJECTIVE To report our experience with the MPT craniotomy in select unruptured anterior circulation aneurysms. METHODS From January 2009 to July 2013, 82 unruptured aneurysms were treated in 72 patients, with 74 MPT craniotomies. Seven patients had multiple aneurysms treated with a single MPT craniotomy. The average patient age was 56 years (range: 24-87). Aneurysms were located along the middle cerebral artery (n = 36), posterior communicating (n = 22), paraophthalmic (n = 22), choroidal (n = 1), and dorsal ICA segments (n = 1). The MPT craniotomy utilized an incision just posterior to the hairline and a single myocutaneous flap. RESULTS The average aneurysm size was 5.45 mm (range: 1-14). There were no instances of compromised operative corridors requiring craniotomy extension. Three significant early postoperative complications included epidural and subdural hematomas requiring evacuation, and a middle cerebral artery infarction. Average length of hospitalization was 3.96 days (range: 2-20). Two patients required reoperation for wound infections. Average follow-up was 421 days (range: 5-1618). Minimal to no temporalis muscle wasting was noted in 96% of patients. CONCLUSION The MPT craniotomy is a worthwhile alternative to the standard pterional craniotomy. There were no instances of suboptimal operative corridors and clip applications when the MPT craniotomy was utilized in the treatment of unruptured middle cerebral artery and supraclinoid internal carotid artery aneurysms proximal to the terminal internal carotid artery bifurcation.","Caplan, Justin M; Papadimitriou, Kyriakos; Yang, Wuyang; Colby, Geoffrey P; Coon, Alexander L; Olivi, Alessandro; Tamargo, Rafael J; Huang, Judy",Neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1227/neu.0000000000000348; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24625424/,476

DESIGN Retrospective cohort between 2009 and 2014. SETTING Twelve children's hospitals in the United States. PATIENTS Two hundred twenty-two pediatric allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients with acute respiratory failure using invasive mechanical ventilation. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS PICU mortality of our cohort was 60.4%. Mortality at 180 days post PICU discharge was 74%. Length of PICU stay prior to initiation of invasive mechanical ventilation was significantly lower in survivors, and the odds of mortality increased for longer length of PICU stay prior to intubation. A total of 91 patients (41%) received noninvasive ventilation at some point during their PICU stay prior to intubation. Noninvasive ventilation use preintubation was associated with increased mortality (odds ratio, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.2-3.6; p = 0.010). Patients ventilated longer than 15 days had higher odds of death (odds ratio, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.3-4.2; p = 0.004). Almost 40% of patients (n = 85) were placed on high-frequency oscillatory ventilation with a mortality of 76.5% (odds ratio, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.7-6.5; p = 0.0004). Of the 20 patients who survived high-frequency oscillatory ventilation, 18 were placed on high-frequency oscillatory ventilation no later than the third day of invasive mechanical ventilation. In this subset of 85 patients, transition to high-frequency oscillatory ventilation within 2 days of the start of invasive mechanical ventilation resulted in a 76% decrease in the odds of death compared with those who transitioned to high-frequency oscillatory ventilation later in the invasive mechanical ventilation course. CONCLUSIONS This study suggests that perhaps earlier more aggressive critical care interventions in the pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplant patient with respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation may offer an opportunity to improve outcomes.","Rowan, Courtney M; Gertz, Shira J; McArthur, Jennifer; Fitzgerald, Julie C; Nitu, Mara E; Loomis, Ashley; Hsing, Deyin D; Duncan, Christine N; Mahadeo, Kris M; Smith, Lincoln S; Moffet, Jerelyn; Hall, Mark W; Pinos, Emily L; Cheifetz, Ira M; Tamburro, Robert F",Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies,https://doi.org/10.1097/pcc.0000000000000673; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26910477/,476

We searched the literature to find effective and safe drugs for patients with COVID-19 during pregnancy and to provide drug therapy strategies for medical staff. According to the current literature we reviewed, we suggest that IFN-α and arbidol can be retained in the treatment regimen for pregnant women and that to reduce maternal mortality, appropriate doses of dexamethasone can be given to those who are predicted to have low premature survival and to receive mechanical ventilation or oxygen. However, the use of dexamethasone in the 1st trimester and after 37 weeks of gestation should be avoided.","Wang, Han; Gao, Yu; Wu, Bo",International journal of clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.5414/cp203817; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33191908/,476

There is no report concerning suture fixation of tracheal stent. The aim of this study was to investigate whether suture fixation of tracheal stent could avoid stent migration in patients with upper trachea stenosis. The complications were further investigated. METHODS The patients with upper trachea stenosis who underwent tracheal stent placement for benign/malignant conditions in our hospital between May 2016 and April 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical data were collected for each patient, including age, gender, co-morbid diseases, site of tracheal obstruction, degree of tracheal obstruction, success of stent placement, impact on patient's symptoms, complications, etc. RESULTS: Eleven patients (8 males and 3 females; range of age: 17-85, and average age of 63) were enrolled into this study. Six silicone stents and five membrane-covered metal stents were used. The surgery was successfully performed in all the cases. The postoperative recovery was uneventful. All symptoms of the patients were relieved. No complications occurred. The average follow-up for patients was 5 months (range of 1-13 months). During the follow-up, no stent migration was observed according to CT and bronchoscope. CONCLUSION The results suggested that suture fixation of stents could avoid stent migration in treating upper trachea stenosis with metal stent or silicone stent.

Both conventional laparoscopy and robotic assisted surgery have impacted the entire spectrum of gynecologic surgery. Ongoing efforts to improve upon the morbidity and cosmetic sequelae of laparoscopic surgery have led to minimization of size and number of ports required for these procedures. LESS surgery is a recently coined surgical term used to describe various techniques that aim at performing laparoscopic surgery through a single, small skin incision concealed within the umbilicus.LESS surgery is not a new endeavor but recent developments in surgical technology and techniques have resulted in an exponential increase in utilization of LESS across many surgical subspecialties. Recently published outcome data demonstrate feasibility, safety and reproducibility for LESS in gynecology. The contemporary LESS literature, gamut of gynecologic procedures and limitations of current technology will be reviewed in this article. SUMMARY LESS represents the latest innovation in minimally invasive surgery but comparative data and prospective trials are required to determine the clinical impact of LESS in treatment of gynecologic conditions.","Fader, Amanda Nickles; Cohen, Sarah; Escobar, Pedro F; Gunderson, Camille",Current opinion in obstetrics & gynecology,https://doi.org/10.1097/gco.0b013e32833be979; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20592589/,476

The analysis of peripheral nerve and blood vessel anatomical structures in adult tissues provides some insights into the understanding of functional neuro-vascular wiring and neuro-vascular degeneration in pathological conditions such as wound healing. As a highly informative model system, we have focused our studies on adult ear skin, which is readily accessible for dissection. Our simple and reproducible protocol provides an accurate depiction of the cellular components in the entire skin, such as peripheral nerves (sensory axons, sympathetic axons, and Schwann cells), blood vessels (endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells), and inflammatory cells. We believe this protocol will pave the way to investigate morphological abnormalities in peripheral nerves and blood vessels as well as the inflammation in the adult ear skin under different pathological conditions.","Yamazaki, Tomoko; Li, Wenling; Mukouyama, Yoh-Suke",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,https://doi.org/10.3791/57406; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29658918/,476
140505,NewsCAP: Autoantibody reactivity implicated in 'long' COVID-19.,2021-03-01,"INTRODUCTION Thermal ablation is a well established treatment option for the management small renal masses. Increasingly, renal ablation is performed via a percutaneous approach. However, most urologists are not formally trained in image-based deployment of ablation needles. To address this need, we created a novel training model to teach urologists to perform precise and accurate percutaneous needle placement. This teaching model was implemented as part of a recent training course on tissue ablation organized by the American Urological Association. METHODS Two fresh frozen human cadavers (Anatomic Gifts Registry, Hanover, Maryland) were used in the model. Plumber's Putty (Oatey, Cleveland, Ohio) and nonpitted olives soaked in Isovue (Bracco Dianostics, Inc, New York, New York) were used to create ablation targets. Course participants underwent a tutorial on the computed tomography (CT)-guided deployment of a 19-gauge Yueh Needle (Cook Medical, Bloomington, Indiana) or Cool-tip radio-frequency ablation (RFA) probe (Covidien, Inc, Boulder, Colorado). After each needle placement, a CT scan was performed to assess successful deployment. Participants were then queried regarding their experience. RESULTS A total of 18 urologists performed needle or radio-frequency ablation probe placement on 2 cadavers. A mean of 3.39 (range 2-5) attempts was required to hit targets. Subjectively, participants noted an increase in confidence performing percutaneous needle deployment. The cadaver laboratory exposed participants to pretreatment planning, tactile feel of needle placement, needle readjustment, and 3-D spatial relationships of a percutaneous approach. CONCLUSIONS The presented cadaveric model is an effective tool for teaching percutaneous needle placement. All urologists evaluated noted increased confidence in this technique after training on the model.","Castle, Scott M; Gorbatiy, Vladislav; Salas, Nelson; Gorin, Michael A; Landman, Jaime; Leveillee, Raymond J",Journal of surgical education,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsurg.2011.06.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22208828/,476

Nowadays, only two classes of anti-influenza drugs, M2 ion channel inhibitors and neuraminidase inhibitors respectively, are used for prophylaxis and treatment of influenza virus infection. Unfortunately, influenza virus strains resistant to one or all of those drugs emerge frequently. Hemagglutinin (HA), the glycoprotein in influenza virus envelope, plays a critical role in viral binding, fusion and entry processes. Therefore, HA is a promising target for developing anti-influenza drugs, which block the initial entry step of viral life cycle. Here we reviewed recent understanding of conformational changes of HA in protein folding and fusion processes, and the discovery of HA-based influenza entry inhibitors, which may provide more choices for preventing and controlling potential pandemics caused by multi-resistant influenza viruses.","Shen, Xintian; Zhang, Xuanxuan; Liu, Shuwen",Journal of thoracic disease,https://doi.org/10.3978/j.issn.2072-1439.2013.06.14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23977436/,476

The present review examines the recent evidence of the possible association between economic recessions and mental health outcomes. METHODS Literature review of records identified through Medline, PsycINFO, SciELO, and EBSCO Host. Only original research papers, published between 2004 and 2014, peer-reviewed, non-qualitative research, and reporting on associations between economic factors and proxies of mental health were considered. RESULTS One-hundred-one papers met the inclusion criteria. The evidence was consistent that economic recessions and mediators such as unemployment, income decline, and unmanageable debts are significantly associated with poor mental wellbeing, increased rates of common mental disorders, substance-related disorders, and suicidal behaviours. CONCLUSION On the basis of a thorough analysis of the selected investigations, we conclude that periods of economic recession are possibly associated with a higher prevalence of mental health problems, including common mental disorders, substance disorders, and ultimately suicidal behaviour. Most of the research is based on cross-sectional studies, which seriously limits causality inferences. Conclusions are summarised, taking into account international policy recommendations concerning the cost-effective measures that can possibly reduce the occurrence of negative mental health outcomes in populations during periods of economic recession.","Frasquilho, Diana; Matos, Margarida Gaspar; Salonna, Ferdinand; Guerreiro, Diogo; Storti, Cláudia C; Gaspar, Tânia; Caldas-de-Almeida, José M",BMC public health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-016-2720-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26847554/,476

From birth, smell is an important sensory modality, highly relevant for neonatal behavioral adaptation. Even though human newborns seem to be able to perceive and react to olfactory stimuli, there is still a lack of knowledge about the ontogeny of smell and the underlying central processing involved in odor perception in newborns. Brain networks involved in chemosensory perception of odorants are well described in adults, however in newborns there is no evidence that central olfaction is functional given the largely unmyelinated neonatal central nervous system. To examine this question, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in the newborn to characterize cortical response to olfactory and trigeminal odorants. Here we show that brain response to odors can be measured and localized using functional MRI in newborns. Furthermore, we found that the developing brain, only few days after birth, processes new artificial odorants in similar cortical areas than adults, including piriform cortex, orbitofrontal cortex and insula. Our work provides evidence that human olfaction at birth relies on brain functions that involve all levels of the cortical olfactory system.","Adam-Darque, Alexandra; Grouiller, Frédéric; Vasung, Lana; Ha-Vinh Leuchter, Russia; Pollien, Philippe; Lazeyras, François; Hüppi, Petra S",Cerebral cortex,https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhx167; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29106509/,476
143150,There is a real danger that covid-19 will become entrenched as a disease of poverty.,2021-04-19,"Autophagy is a powerful host defense that restricts herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) pathogenesis in neurons. As a countermeasure, the viral ICP34.5 polypeptide, which is exclusively encoded by HSV, antagonizes autophagy in part through binding Beclin1. However, whether autophagy is a cell-type-specific antiviral defense or broadly restricts HSV-1 reproduction in nonneuronal cells is unknown. Here, we establish that autophagy limits HSV-1 productive growth in nonneuronal cells and is repressed by the Us3 gene product. Phosphorylation of the autophagy regulators ULK1 and Beclin1 in virus-infected cells was dependent upon the HSV-1 Us3 Ser/Thr kinase. Furthermore, Beclin1 was unexpectedly identified as a direct Us3 kinase substrate. Although disabling autophagy did not impact replication of an ICP34.5-deficient virus in primary human fibroblasts, depleting Beclin1 and ULK1 partially rescued Us3-deficient HSV-1 replication. This shows that autophagy restricts HSV-1 reproduction in a cell-intrinsic manner in nonneuronal cells and is suppressed by multiple, independent viral functions targeting Beclin1 and ULK1. Moreover, it defines a surprising role regulating autophagy for the Us3 kinase, which unlike ICP34.5 is widely encoded by alpha-herpesvirus subfamily members.","Rubio, Rosa M; Mohr, Ian",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1915139116; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31843932/,476

METHODS A prospective, single tertiary pandemic center cohort study was conducted on pregnant women with confirmed or suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Positive diagnosis was made on a real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of a nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimen. Demographic features, clinical characteristics, and maternal and perinatal outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS SARS-CoV-2 was suspected in 100 pregnant women. Of them, 29 had the diagnosis confirmed by RT-PCR. Eight of the remaining 71 cases had clinical findings highly suspicious for COVID-19. Ten (34.5%) of the confirmed cases had co-morbidities. Cough (58.6%) and myalgia (51.7%) were the leading symptoms. COVID-19 therapy was given to 10 (34.5%) patients. There were no admissions to the intensive care unit. Pregnancy complications were present in 7 (24.1%) patients. Half of the births (5/10) were cesarean deliveries. None of the neonates were positive for SARS-CoV-2.

The aim of this project was to establish national practical recommendations for the management of patients suitable for VATS lobectomy. METHODS The Scientific Committee of the VATS Lobectomy Group (a branch of the Italian Society of Thoracic Surgery) identified the consensus conference as an appropriate tool for a national debate. The consensus conference was organized following indications of the Italian Department of Health: a panel of experts reviewed the literature, the jury board revised the experts' reports, and the national conference discussed and voted on statements. The strength of recommendation for a statement was classified as weak, fair, or high when the total score ranged between 51% and 67%, 68% and 84%, or 85% and 100%, respectively. RESULTS Eighty-six Italian thoracic surgeons attended the 1st Italian Consensus Conference on VATS lobectomy in Giulianova, Italy, on October 29-30, 2015. Thirty-three topics were discussed: indications, surgical strategy, perioperative management, and training were the main topics. Consensus was reached on 24 statements that were consequently recommended. CONCLUSIONS The Italian Consensus Conference is the first attempt to discuss VATS lobectomy-related issues in a national scientific community. Such experience determined an improvement in epistemic knowledge among the Italian thoracic surgeons and could be a suggestion for other national communities.","Nosotti, Mario; Droghetti, Andrea; Luzzi, Luca; Solli, Piergiorgio; Crisci, Roberto",Tumori,https://doi.org/10.5301/tj.5000578; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28009427/,476

147015,Living with covid-19.,2020,"OBJECTIVES This study aimed to investigate the effect of oral antiviral treatment on the prognosis of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after radiofrequency (RF) ablation. METHODS Between January 2003 and December 2010, 228 patients without a history of antiviral treatment were treated with RF ablation for a single HBV-related HCC. We divided the patients into two groups, patients who received (n=125) or did not receive antiviral treatment (n=103), based on whether oral antiviral treatment was administered after RF ablation. The median duration of antiviral treatment was 60.1 months. HCC recurrence and overall survival were compared in the two groups in the full cohort and the propensity score-matched cohort. RESULTS In the matched cohort, the probability of HCC recurrence at 5 years was 43.8% for the non-antiviral treatment group and 14.7% for the antiviral treatment group (p<0.001). The probability of overall survival at 5 years was 77.2% for the non-antiviral treatment group and 93.5% for the antiviral treatment group (p=0.002). Multivariable analysis showed that risk factors for HCC recurrence included large tumor size (hazard ratio (HR)=1.30, p=0.022), HBV DNA serum level (HR=1.11, p=0.005), and serum AFP level ≥20 ng/mL (HR=1.66, p=0.005). Overall survival was associated with larger tumor size (HR=1.86, p=0.001) and Child-Pugh Class B (HR=2.13, p=0.019). Oral antiviral treatment after RF ablation was significantly associated with a lower risk of tumor recurrence and death (HR=0.33, p<0.001, and HR=0.44, p=0.004). CONCLUSION Use of oral antiviral treatment after curative RF ablation was associated with favorable outcomes in terms of tumor recurrence and overall survival in patients with HBV-related HCC.","Sohn, Won; Kang, Tae Wook; Choi, Sun-Kyu; Jung, Sin-Ho; Lee, Min Woo; Lim, Hyo Keun; Cho, Ju-Yeon; Shim, Sang Goon; Sinn, Dong Hyun; Gwak, Geum-Youn; Choi, Moon Seok; Lee, Joon Hyeok; Koh, Kwang Cheol; Paik, Seung Woon; Rhim, Hyunchul; Paik, Yong-Han",Oncotarget,https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.10026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27329596/,476

Nursing students have been greatly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in documented trauma, complicated grief, depression, anxiety, and secondary stress syndrome. Students entering health care in a new landscape of ongoing trauma and chronic stress exposure require a shift in the nurse educators' role and position. Extensive outcome-based synthesis of trauma-informed education in other disciplines served as basis to create a pedagogical context using the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) framework for trauma-informed schools. Utilizing Watson's strategies for human caring theory in nursing education, a trauma-informed pedagogy is proposed for nurse educators. This framework for nurse educators and leaders will assist in navigating how to approach trauma-informed education in the context of higher education in nursing. It is time for a paradigm shift in nursing education towards a more collaborative, relational model with students, based on trauma-informed care; where trauma awareness and the impact on one's being serves purpose for the nursing student.","Goddard, Anna; Jones, Rebecca Witten; Esposito, Dorothea; Janicek, Erin",Nurse education today,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nedt.2021.104880; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33798984/,476

While food trade and the embedded (virtual) water (VW) may improve food availability and accessibility for more people all year round, the sustainability and efficiency of food and VW trade needs to be revisited. In this research, we assess the sustainability and efficiency of food and VW trades under two food security scenarios for Iran, a country suffering from an escalating water crisis. These scenarios are (1) Individual Crop Food Security (ICFS), which restricts calorie fulfillment from individual crops and (2) Crop Category Food Security (CCFS), which promotes ""eating local"" by suggesting food substitution within the crop category. To this end, we simulate the water footprint and VW trades of 27 major crops, within 8 crop categories, in 30 provinces of Iran (2005-2015). We investigate the impacts of these two scenarios on (a) provincial food security (FSp) and exports; (b) sustainable and efficient blue water consumption, and (c) blue VW export. We then test the correlation between agro-economic and socio-environmental indicators and provincial food security. Our results show that most provinces were threatened by unsustainable and inefficient blue water consumption for crop production, particularly in the summertime. This water mismanagement results in 14.41 and 8.45 billion m3 y-1 unsustainable and inefficient blue VW exports under ICFS. ""Eating local"" improves the FSp value by up to 210% which lessens the unsustainable and inefficient blue VW export from hotspots. As illustrated in the graphical abstract, the FSp value strongly correlates with different agro-economic and socio-environmental indicators, but in different ways. Our findings promote ""eating local"" besides improving agro-economic and socio-environmental conditions to take transformative steps toward eradicating food insecurity not only in Iran but also in other countries facing water limitations.","Karandish, Fatemeh; Nouri, Hamideh; Brugnach, Marcela",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-93928-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34294765/,476

However, there is a lack of evidence on the impact of specialist heart failure (HF) prescribing pharmacists on consultant HF ward rounds. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact on prescribing when a specialist HF prescribing pharmacist attended inpatient HF ward rounds. METHODS A prospective service evaluation completed at a tertiary hospital between September and December 2020. The same HF prescribing pharmacist attended the HF consultant-led ward round once a week on 15 occasions. For each medicine change, the pharmacist documented: who suggested the intervention, the medicine, prescribing action, reason for review and the primary reason for change. Medicines were categorised into four groups (heart failure, cardiovascular, anticoagulation and other) for analysis. RESULTS A total of 158 patients were reviewed and 226 individual changes suggested; 48% of these were consultant led (n=108) and 52% (n=118) due to pharmacist recommendations. All medicines interventions were prescribed on the round by the pharmacist. For consultants, the primary reason for medicine change was to ensure efficacy of HF medicines, 80% (n=73), followed by safety (HF medicines), 20% (n=18). For the pharmacist, the primary reason was safety across all the medicine groups, 36% (n=42), followed by efficacy relating to missing drug history items, 24% (n=28). CONCLUSIONS HF consultants focused on ensuring patients have the most effective combination of HF medications.

Drawing on in-depth interviews with family members in the intensive care unit (ICU) during an end-of-life hospitalization and into their bereavement period up to six months after the death of the patient, this article examines bereaved family members' experiences of grief by examining three aspects from the end-of-life hospitalization and decision-making in the ICU that informed their subsequent bereavement experiences. First, this article explores how the process of advance care planning (ACP) shaped family experiences of grief, by demonstrating that even prior informal conversations around end-of-life care outside of having an advance directive in the hospital was beneficial for family members both during the hospitalization and afterwards in bereavement. Second, clinicians' compassionate caring for both patients and families through the ""little things"" or small gestures were important to families during the end-of-life hospitalization and afterwards in bereavement. Third, the transition time in the hospital before the patient's death facilitated family experiences of grief by providing a sense of support and meaning in bereavement. The findings have implications for clinicians who provide end-of-life care by highlighting salient aspects from the hospitalization that may shape family grief following the patient's death. Most importantly, the notion that ACP as a social process may be a ""gift"" to families during end-of-life decision-making and carry through into bereavement can serve as a motivator to engage patients in ACP.","Bandini, Julia I",Health,https://doi.org/10.1177/1363459320946474; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32748652/,476

The guide, entitled Guía bioética para asignación de recursos limitados de medicina crítica en situación de emergencia, was intended as a preliminary document, but the website posting did not describe it as a first step in the process. The publicity resulted in a wide array of comments and criticisms. That first version posted on the CSG website contained an age-based criterion for breaking a tie between two or more medically eligible patients who needed of a ventilator: younger patients would have preference over older ones. The final version of the guide eliminated that criterion and instead, relied on the leading public health principle, ""save the most lives"", without regard to personal characteristics other than the possibility of benefitting from the scarce medical resources.","Macklin, Ruth",Salud publica de Mexico,https://doi.org/10.21149/11486; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32516867/,476

Most cohorts include a myriad of anatomies and associated conditions. METHOD In order to establish objective performance criteria, we performed a retrospective review of all patients who underwent unilateral pulmonary artery stenting in biventricular physiology at three centers from June 2006 to June 2011. RESULTS Fifty-eight patients received 60 stents with Palmaz Genesis stent used most commonly (78%). Average age at implantation was 10.4 ± 10.3 years and weight 31.6 ± 21.8 kg. The immediate success rate was 98%, with improvement in minimal diameter from 5.1 ± 2 cm to 10.6 ± 3 cm (P < 0.01). There were 10 complications (7 major and 3 minor) and no acute mortality. One-year follow-up studies were available in 48 patients (83%), including echocardiogram (60%), catheterization (28%), MRI (29%), and lung perfusion (31%). Follow-up echocardiogram showed mild increase in stent gradient, from 5.7 ± 6.7 mm Hg post-procedure to 17.1 ± 11.7 mm Hg. Follow-up catheterization showed no significant change in minimal stent diameter (8.8 ± 2.6 to 7.8 ± 2.3 mm), gradient (7.7 ± 8.4 to 12.6 ± 12.2 mm Hg), or right ventricular pressures (43.7 ± 9 to 47.7 ± 10.5 mm Hg). Nine patients (16%) underwent scheduled stent redilation over a period of 12 days to 25 months. CONCLUSION In conclusion, stent implantation shows excellent immediate and 1-year follow-up results with maintenance of improved caliber of the stented vessel and lowered right ventricular systolic pressures.","Ing, Frank F; Khan, Asra; Kobayashi, Daisuke; Hagler, Donald J; Forbes, Thomas J",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.25567; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24910458/,476

Implementation of a mandatory home intravenous hydration protocol can avoid this. We aim to evaluate the impact of mandatory home intravenous hydration for patients with newly created ileostomies. MATERIALS AND METHODS All patients at a single, tertiary care center who underwent ileostomy creation during a period of sporadic home intravenous hydration (February 2011-December 2013) and mandatory protocol hydration (March 2016-December 2018) were reviewed for incidence of dehydration, readmissions, and emergency department visits. RESULTS 241 patients were evaluated. 119 were in the ""sporadic"" group and 122 were in the ""protocol"" group. Operative approach differed among both groups, with hydration protocol patients undergoing 15% less open procedures and 4.9% more hand-assisted laparoscopic procedures (P = .0017). Prior to protocol implementation, 23.5% of patients were sent home with intravenous hydration. Length of hospital stay after index ileostomy creation was shorter for ""protocol"" patients by 3.3 days (P < .0001). 15.1% of ""sporadic"" patients experienced dehydration as compared to 7.4% of ""protocol"" patients (P = .0283). Following protocol implementation, the number of patients readmitted due to dehydration increased from 13 to 14 (P = .01). DISCUSSION Standardized, mandatory at-home intravenous hydration following ileostomy creation leads to a significant reduction in postoperative incidence of dehydration and dehydration-associated readmissions. This protocol should be followed for all patients with newly created ileostomies, so long as adequate home health nursing support and active surveillance are available.","Borsuk, Daniel J; Studniarek, Adam; Marecik, Slawomir J; Park, John J; Kochar, Kunal",The American surgeon,https://doi.org/10.1177/0003134820971574; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33280399/,476

In addition, the potential mechanisms of MTMR2 promoting the progression of NKTCL was further explored. MATERIALS AND METHODS Quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to examine MTMR2 level in peripheral blood of 45 patients with NK/T-cell lymphoma and 45 healthy volunteers. The interplay between MTMR2 expression and clinical indicators, as well as the prognosis of patients with NK/T-cell lymphoma was analyzed. Meanwhile, MTMR2 expression in NKTCL cell lines was verified by qRT-PCR. Subsequently, MTMR2 knockdown and the overexpression models were constructed using lentivirus in NKTCL cell lines, including SNK-6 and KHYG-1. Transwell invasion and cell wound healing assays were applied to analyze the effect of MTMR2 on the biological function of NKTCL cells. Finally, an in-depth study of the relationship between MTMR2 and JAK1 was conducted to explore the underlying mechanism. RESULTS QRT-PCR results showed that the expression level of MTMR2 in the serum of patients with NKTCL was remarkably higher than that of healthy volunteers, and the difference was statistically significant (p<0.05). Compared with patients with low expression of MTMR2, patients with high expression of MTMR2 exhibited significantly higher incidence of distant metastasis and lower overall survival rate (p<0.05). The metastasis ability of NKTCL SNK-6 cells was remarkably attenuated in MTMR2 knockdown group when compared with the negative control sh-NC group (p<0.05). Meanwhile, the metastatic ability of NKTCL KHYG-1 cells in MTMR2 overexpressing group was remarkably enhanced when compared with the control NC group (p<0.05). The Luciferase reporter gene assay confirmed that MTMR2 could target JAK1, thereby jointly regulating the malignant progression of NKTCL. In addition, cell recovery experiment verified that JAK1 could partially reverse the enhanced metastatic ability of NKTCL cells induced by the overexpression of MTMR2. CONCLUSIONS MTMR2 was highly expressed in NKTCL serum samples and cell lines, leading to high risk of distant metastasis and poor prognosis. In addition, MTMR2 might promote the malignant progression of NKTCL by regulating JAK1.","Wang, J; He, A-L; Zhang, W-G; Cao, X-M; Chen, Y-X; Liu, J; Zhao, W-H; Yang, Y; Wang, J-L; Liu, H-L; Ma, X-R",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202008_22489; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32767332/,476

DESIGN, SETTING Prospective, observational cohort study in 77 ICUs across Australia. PARTICIPANTS Patients admitted to participating ICUs with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 during 27 February - 30 June 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES ICU mortality and resource use (ICU length of stay, peak bed occupancy). RESULTS The median age of the 204 patients with COVID-19 admitted to intensive care was 63.5 years (IQR, 53-72 years); 140 were men (69%). The most frequent comorbid conditions were obesity (40% of patients), diabetes (28%), hypertension treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (24%), and chronic cardiac disease (20%); 73 patients (36%) reported no comorbidity. The most frequent source of infection was overseas travel (114 patients, 56%). Median peak ICU bed occupancy was 14% (IQR, 9-16%). Invasive ventilation was provided for 119 patients (58%). Median length of ICU stay was greater for invasively ventilated patients than for non-ventilated patients (16 days; IQR, 9-28 days v 3 days; IQR, 2-5 days), as was ICU mortality (26 deaths, 22%; 95% CI, 15-31% v four deaths, 5%; 95% CI, 1-12%). Higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE-II) scores on ICU day 1 (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.15; 95% CI, 1.09-1.21) and chronic cardiac disease (aHR, 3.38; 95% CI, 1.46-7.83) were each associated with higher ICU mortality. CONCLUSION Until the end of June 2020, mortality among patients with COVID-19 who required invasive ventilation in Australian ICUs was lower and their ICU stay longer than reported overseas.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Among patients who were diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma and underwent RN, 20 patients were selected who received open, laparoscopic, robot-assisted laparoscopic, or VAMS RN between January 2008 and December 2010. Their medical fees were divided into four categories: procedure and operation, anesthesia, laboratory test, and medical supply fees. The medical costs of the patients were also divided into insured and uninsured costs. RESULTS The total direct cost of VAMS, open, laparoscopic, and robot-assisted laparoscopic RN were 2,023,791±240,757, 2,024,246±674,859 (p=0.998), 3,603,557±870,333 (p<0.01), and 8,021,902±330,157 (p<0.01) Korean Won (KRW, the currency of South Koea), respectively. The total insured cost of VAMS, open, laparoscopic, and robot-assisted laparoscopic RN was 1,904,627±231,957, 1,798,127±645,602 (p=0.634), 3,039,769±711,792 (p<0.01), and 899,668±323,508 (p<0.01) KRW, respectively. The total uninsured cost of VAMS, open, laparoscopic, and robot-assisted laparoscopic RN was 119,163±24,581, 226,119±215,009, 563,788±487,798 (p<0.01), and 7,122,234±56,117 (p<0.01) KRW, respectively. Medical supply fees accounted for the largest portion of the costs and amounted to 33.43% of the VAMS cost. CONCLUSIONS VAMS RN is as cost-effective as open surgery.

160489,The Persistence of Vaccine Hesitancy: COVID-19 Vaccination Intention in New Zealand.,2021-03-15,Epigenetics concerns gene regulatory mechanisms beyond DNA sequence，such as DNA methylation，histone modification，chromatin remodeling，and non-coding RNA. Epigenetic mechanisms play a key role in development，cell fate decision and tumorigenesis. Chromatin modifications and its high order structure across our genome are major forms of epigenetic information，and its establishment and maintenance are closely related to cell metabolism. Metabolic changes in cancer cells include aerobic glycolysis，increased glucose uptake，abnormally active glutamine metabolism，and the use of non-conventional energy supply. These changes meet the vigorous energy and matter needs for the development and spread of cancer，and help tumor cells adapt to hypoxia microenvironment for their survival，proliferation，invasion and migration. There is a complex relationship between epigenetic modifications and cell metabolism in tumor. On the one hand，metabolites in tumor cells may act as cofactors，modification donors or antagonists of epigenetic enzymes，thus modulating the epigenetic landscape. On the other hand，epigenetic modifications can directly regulate the expression of metabolic enzymes，transporters，signaling pathway and transcription factors to affect cell metabolism. This article reviews the crosstalk between epigenetics and cancer metabolism，to explore their potential future applications in the treatment of tumors.,"Feng, Fan; Li, Haitao; Han, Hengyi",Zhejiang da xue xue bao.

METHODS We analyzed the pooled data from the Multi Mechanical Embolus Removal in Cerebral Ischemia (MERCI), MERCI Registry and Thrombectomy Revascularization of Large Vessel Occlusions (TREVO), and TREVO 2 trials and assessed times from last known normal to puncture, from hospital arrival to puncture, and procedure duration by year to determine if there has been a reduction in times. Demographic, radiographic, and clinical information were also assessed in a multivariate regression analysis to determine the predictors of good outcomes defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2 at 3 months. RESULTS 1248 patients of mean age 68±14 years and median NIH Stroke Scale score 18 were analyzed from 2001 to 2011. Procedure times showed a significant improvement while last known normal to puncture times remained static. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, longer last known normal to puncture time and longer procedure duration were associated with a decreased chance of a good outcome (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.92, p=0.0004 and OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.91, p=0.0040, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Despite a reduction in procedure times, there has not been a corresponding improvement in overall last known normal to puncture times over a 10-year period.

162269,Why COVID-19 Will Not Change the Global Art Market,2021,"BACKGROUND High frequency oscillation is a safe and effective treatment for patients with ARDS, but poses a patient and caregiver risk when the circuit is disconnected. We modified the circuit to include a heated expiratory filter, eliminating the need for daily filter changes due to buildup of condensate. The purpose of the study was to determine if substitution of the filter resulted in a clinically important change in delivered tidal volume or amplitude. We additionally compared expiratory resistance and measured efficacy for the substituted filter. METHODS This bench study measured tidal volume and amplitude using 5 of each filter type across 6 patient setting scenarios. Filter efficacy was tested through an independent laboratory, and expiratory resistance measurements were taken after prolonged use with humidification. RESULTS The clinically important threshold value for tidal volume (defined as 5% difference) was excluded by the limits of agreement, confirming that use of the modified circuit does not result in alterations in tidal volume. The clinically important threshold for amplitude (defined as 10% difference) was the same as the lower confidence interval on the lower limit of agreement, indicating it is possible for amplitude values to be different between the 2 filters. Filter efficacy for the substituted filter was not affected. Expiratory resistance was unchanged in the substituted filter, but nearly doubled for the manufacturer's filter after 48 hours. CONCLUSIONS Modifying the circuit to include a heated expiratory filter does not affect tidal volume, and the filter material remains efficacious during oscillation. Amplitude varies under some conditions. Preventing the need for daily filter changes reduces the risk of alveolar de-recruitment. This does not completely eliminate exposure to expired gases, but provides an additional layer of protection against occupational exposure and nosocomial spread of respiratory pathogens. Further testing in a clinical environment is necessary.","McKeown, Shari I; Serreqi, Nicola",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.01219; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22005725/,476

Imbalanced glucocorticoid production and glucocorticoid receptor activity have been linked to socioeconomically crippling neuropsychiatric disorders, and accordingly there is a need to develop in vivo models to help understand disease progression and management. Therefore, we developed the transgenic SR4G zebrafish reporter line with six glucocorticoid response elements used to promote expression of a short half-life green fluorescent protein following glucocorticoid receptor activation. Herein, we document the ability of this reporter line to respond to both chronic and acute exogenous glucocorticoid treatment. The green fluorescent protein expression in response to transgene activation was high in a variety of tissues including the brain, and provided single-cell resolution in the effected regions. The specificity of these responses is demonstrated using the partial agonist mifepristone and mutation of the glucocorticoid receptor. Importantly, the reporter line also modeled the temporal dynamics of endogenous stress response signaling, including the increased production of the glucocorticoid cortisol following hyperosmotic stress and the fluctuations of basal cortisol concentrations with the circadian rhythm. Taken together, these results characterize our newly developed reporter line for elucidating environmental or genetic modifiers of stress response signaling, which may provide insights to the neuronal mechanisms underlying neuropsychiatric disorders such as major depressive disorder.","Krug, R G; Poshusta, T L; Skuster, K J; Berg, M R; Gardner, S L; Clark, K J","Genes, brain, and behavior",https://doi.org/10.1111/gbb.12135; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24679220/,476

Remdesivir is the only broad-spectrum antiviral approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection. Although the adverse effects of remdesivir are largely unknown, data from randomized controlled trials have demonstrated its deleterious effect on the liver. This review briefly addresses the hepatic manifestations of COVID-19 infection and the data regarding the efficacy and adverse effects of remdesivir on liver function when used in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Through a literature search, we identified five randomized controlled trials, two case reports, and one case series, including a total of 2375 patients. Although mild transaminase elevation has been reported as a feature of COVID-19, there has been a concern of hepatotoxicity associated with the use of remdesivir. Based on the limited available data regarding the adverse effects of remdesivir on hepatic function, it is prudent to exercise caution by evaluating baseline liver function, avoiding the use of potentially hepatotoxic drugs, and closely monitoring liver function when using remdesivir in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.","Aleem, Abdul; Mahadevaiah, Guruprasad; Shariff, Nasir; Kothadia, Jiten P",Proceedings,https://doi.org/10.1080/08998280.2021.1885289; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34219928/,476
162758,Parasocial Relationships With President Trump as a Predictor of COVID-19 Information Seeking,2020,"AimsThe aim of this project is to improve the quality of documentation and recording of the assessment and monitoring of patients commencing clozapine in BHSCT.BackgroundClozapine is an effective treatment for patients with schizophrenia who have not responded to at least two other antipsychotics. Due to clozapine's significant side effect profile patients must be carefully assessed prior to treatment initiation with close monitoring of their physical observations and reported side effects during initiation.The BHSCT Clozapine Pathway currently uses a Clozapine Assessment Integrated Care Pathway (ICP) common to inpatient and outpatient clozapine titrations and a Clozapine Titration ICP which varies slightly between inpatient and outpatient titrations.MethodThe Clozapine ICPs of patients commenced on clozapine in BHSCT in a 9 month period commencing January 2019 were reviewed. Handwritten clinical records were used to collect data on rates of completion of all aspects of the pathway.These results were used to identify areas of the pathway that were being poorly completed and the “Method for Improvement Model” used to trial changes to the pathway using Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles.Result20 patients in BHSCT were commenced on clozapine in the 9 month period. 1 Clozapine Initiation Pathway could not be located;therefore data were collected on 19 patients. 2 patients were initiated in the community and 17 patients initiated as inpatients.The results showed that sections of the Clozapine Assessment ICP were poorly completed;for example only 27% of the “Patient Baseline Preparation Checklist” were complete, with 60% partially complete and 13% completely blank.In the inpatient clozapine titration ICP the physical observations record was complete in only 20% of patients and the side effects monitoring record complete in only 13% of patients. Conversely the physical observations and side effects monitoring records were complete in 100% (n = 2) of patients.ConclusionBHSCT Clozapine Pathways were being poorly completed, with outpatient pathways being completed better than inpatient pathways. Analysis of the data shows that repetition of information in various parts of the pathway leads to gaps in documentation.Parts of the pathway that were poorly completed have been redesigned and the impact of these changes assessed using the PDSA cycle method. It is hoped that this along with education of staff will lead to an improvement in the assessment and monitoring of patients being commenced on clozapine.","Cairns, Rebecca Guy Stephen",BJPsych Open,https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2021.482,476

We describe how an epidemic model can be integrated into a multi-stakeholder multi-criteria framework and how a more integrated analysis can be done, even under significant uncertainties. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Ekenberg, L.; Mihai, A.; Fasth, T.; Komendantova, N.; Danielson, M.; Al-Salaymeh, A.","21st International Conference on Group Decision and Negotiation, GDN 2021",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-77208-6_1,476
162830,Sculpture and haptic deficit in the time of COVID-19,2021,"Background. A large cluster of 59 cases were linked to a single flight with 146 passengers from New Delhi to Hong Kong in April 2021. This outbreak coincided with early reports of exponential pandemic growth in New Delhi, which reached a peak of >400,000 newly confirmed cases on 7 May 2021. Methods. Epidemiological information including date of symptom onset, date of positive-sample detection, and travel and contact history for individual cases from this flight were collected. Whole genome sequencing was performed, and sequences were classified based on the dynamic Pango nomenclature system. Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analysis compared sequences from this flight alongside other cases imported from India to Hong Kong on 26 flights between June 2020 and April 2021, as well as sequences from India or associated with India-related travel from February to April 2021, and 1,217 reference sequences. Results. Sequence analysis identified six lineages of SARS-CoV-2 belonging to two variants of concern (Alpha and Delta) and one variant of public health interest (Kappa) involved in this outbreak. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed at least three independent sub-lineages of Alpha with limited onward transmission, a superspreading event comprising 37 cases of Kappa, and transmission of Delta to only one passenger. Additional analysis of another 26 flights from India to Hong Kong confirmed widespread circulation of all three variants in India since early March 2021. Conclusions. The broad spectrum of disease severity and long incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 pose a challenge for surveillance and control. As illustrated by this particular outbreak, opportunistic infections of SARS-CoV-2 can occur irrespective of variant lineage, and requiring a nucleic acid test within 72 hours of departure may be insufficient to prevent importation or in-flight transmission.","Dhanasekaran, V.; Edwards, K.

163118,eHomeCaregiving: A Diabetes Patient-Centered Blockchain Ecosystem for COVID-19 Caregiving,2021,"Introduction: Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious and virulent infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The symptoms arise within 2 to 14 days after the infection. The specimens are collected from the upper respiratory tract through nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab. This sampling requires close contact with COVID-19 patients and may directly cause transmission to health care professionals. Saliva specimens can be collected easily by asking patients to spit into a sterile container. Materials and Methods: In the current study, the selected patients (n = 20) were those who tested positive for COVID-19 and were admitted to the hospital. After getting approval from ethical committee of the hospital, both nasopharyngeal swab specimens and the salivary samples of each patient were collected and tested using standard procedure of real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results: The mean cycle threshold values obtained from both the sampling techniques were correlated. It was seen that there was no significant difference between them. The advantage of using saliva as a specimen is in the overall specimen collection procedure and its cost and time effectiveness. The diagnosis of COVID-19 through a rapid test procedure using salivary samples could be a boon to dentists. Conclusion: This would help in the detection of positive asymptomatic carriers of the virus among the patients who come to seek dental treatment and reduce the risk of infection in the dental office. The results of this study clearly show that the values obtained from the two sampling techniques are closely related, and hence saliva could definitely be considered as a diagnostic aid for COVID-19.","Shetty, Prashant Udhani Barkha Makandar Saleem Alawi Rabihah Noorani Tahir Jha Neetu Bapna Pradeep",Dental Hypotheses,https://doi.org/10.4103/denthyp.denthyp_180_20,476

In this paper, we propose an interpretation of its causes and its current and foreseeable effects through a dual theoretical framework. On the one hand, we will use Edward Tenner?s concept of the revenge effect, which refers to the phenomenon by which a technique produces unexpected consequences that cancel its objective. In this case, modern mobility techniques, by spreading the disease on a global scale, have produced the opposite effect, that is, the mobility limitations of lockdowns. On the other hand, we will embrace Jacques Ellul?s philosophy of technique, which shows how many problems produced by modern technique, such as the current pandemic, have an ultimate tendency toward the establishment of a centralized and authoritarian organization of humanity not compatible with the fundamental rights of liberal democracies. The conclusion drawn from these elements will be that the way the pandemic has been tackled supports Ellul?s prediction about the establishment of such an organization.","Carabantes, Manuel","Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values",https://doi.org/10.1177/01622439211008595,476

However, they also pose new clinical challenges related to dosing, administration, adverse event management and patient adherence. All members of the oncology healthcare team play a unique role in the management of these patients and must be kept up to date with the latest advances in this clinical space. Methods: From 2018-2020, CEC Oncology developed educational initiatives focused on novel therapies in B-cell malignancies for physicians, pharmacists, and nurses, which included activities across practice settings: symposia held at two Hematology/Oncology Pharmacy Association (HOPA) Annual Meetings, two Grand Rounds (GR) series, two Oncology Nursing Society (ONS) Chapter series, and one American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Chapter series (N=1,658). Statistical testing between pre- and post-tests and from pre-test to follow-up were conducted via chi square analysis with a priori significance set at 0.05. Follow-up assessments were sent to participants after each live activity to determine retention of knowledge and whether knowledge was translated into practice at follow-up. Results: Knowledge (Pre- & Post-activity Assessments) We compared Level 3 ONS Chapter data with that from HOPA symposia. ONS Chapters tend to occur in suburbs/rural areas, whereas national meetings are in metropolitan areas, involving clinicians from academic medical centers. Pre-test questions were given prior to the activity to assess baseline understanding and at post-test to assess knowledge gained from the activity. There was a statistically significant increase in knowledge from pre-test to post-test in all ONS and HOPA educational activities for the topics listed in Figures 1-4 (P<0.05). Competence (Intent to Change and Anticipated Barriers) Top changes participants intended to make in practice were similar across the activities, with a few differences: -Share information learned with colleagues/members of the interprofessional team -Educate patients/caregivers regarding BTK inhibitor adverse events -Consider use of BTK inhibitors in appropriate patients (GR series and ASCO Chapters) -Educate colleagues/members of the interprofessional team about safety/efficacy of BTK inhibitors (ONS Chapters & HOPA Symposia) Top barriers participants anticipated facing in practice were: -Staying current with rapidly evolving clinical data/guidelines -Lack of patient adherence to oral chemotherapy -Formulary/insurance restrictions -Lack of knowledge regarding mitigating resistance to BTK inhibitors (HOPA Symposia) Conclusions: Participant knowledge related to the differentiating between BTK inhibitors, familiarity with adverse event profiles, and proper management of adverse events were assessed in the ONS Chapter series and HOPA Symposia. In all activities, there were statistically significant increases in knowledge for these topics from pre-test to post-test, demonstrating the impact of our education across all practice settings. -Due to COVID-19, our live educational activities have been converted to a virtual format. HOPA 2020 was the first to go virtual and had similar educational outcomes to our live activities. -91% of participants stated that they would make a practice change as a result of these educational activities. The top changes participants intended to make in practice were to share information learned with colleagues and to educate patients/caregivers about BTK inhibitor adverse events. -Barriers to change were most commonly cited by the nursing audience.

(Special Issue: Covid-19 and climate change.),2021,"The outward migration of skilled migrants has disproportionally affected the Global South, particularly in countries in Africa, producing what is commonly referred to as ‘brain drain’. Within this literature, there has been considerable focus on the future migration intentions of international students, who symbolise skilled migration. However, much previous literature assumes international education must be obtained through physical mobility, despite the growing provision of internationalisation at a distance, whereby students remain ‘at home’ while studying online or distantly from an institution based ‘abroad’. This study has unravelled the future migration intentions of students studying through online distance education, using a questionnaire of 607 South African, Namibian, and Zimbabwean students in relation to four sets of factors: academic and social adjustment, educational and work experience, socio-economic variables, and individual demographic characteristics. Our findings indicate a complex picture of international distance students’ future migration intentions and significant differences between students based on country of origin, socioeconomic status, and demographic variables. These findings have particular relevance following the increasing shifts to online distance learning following the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods: We conducted a test-negative case-control study at Kaiser Permanente Southern California. Whole genome sequencing was conducted for SARS-CoV-2 positive specimens collected from 3/1/2021 to 7/27/2021. Test-positive cases were matched 1:5 to test-negative controls on age, sex, race/ethnicity, and specimen collection date. Outcomes included SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalization. Exposures were 2 doses or 1 dose of mRNA-1273 [≥]14 days prior to specimen collection versus no COVID-19 vaccination. Conditional logistic regression was used to compare odds of vaccination among cases versus controls, adjusting for confounders. VE was calculated as (1-odds ratio)x100%. Results: The study included 8,153 cases and their matched controls. Two-dose VE (95% confidence interval) was 86.7% (84.3-88.7%) against Delta infection, 98.4% (96.9-99.1%) against Alpha, 90.4% (73.9-96.5%) against Mu, 96-98% against other identified variants, and 79.9% (76.9-82.5%) against unidentified variants. VE against Delta declined from 94.1% (90.5-96.3%) 14-60 days after vaccination to 80.0% (70.2-86.6%) 151-180 days after vaccination. Waning was less pronounced for non-Delta variants. VE against Delta was lower among individuals aged [≥]65 years (75.2% [59.6-84.8%]) than those aged 18-64 years (87.9% [85.5-89.9%]). VE against Delta hospitalization was 97.6% (92.8-99.2%). One-dose VE was 77.0% (60.7-86.5%) against Delta infection. Conclusions: Two doses of mRNA-1273 were highly effective against all SARS-CoV-2 variants. However, VE against Delta moderately declined with increasing time since vaccination.","Bruxvoort, K.; Sy, L. S.; Qian, L.; Ackerson, B. K.; Luo, Y.; Lee, G.

164777,Creative Approaches in Solution-Focused Teletherapy: A COVID-19 Renaissance Man,2021,"VEGF inhibitor drugs have been successful, especially in ophthalmology, but not all patients respond to them. Combinations of drugs are likely to be needed for a really effective therapy of angiogenesis-related diseases. In this paper we describe naturally occurring combinations of receptors in endothelial cells that might help to identify targets for drug combinations. We also develop and share a new computational method and a software tool called DECNEO to identify them. Single-cell gene expression data are used to identify a set of co-expressed endothelial cell receptors, conserved among species (mice and human) and enriched, within a network, of connections to up-regulated genes. This set includes several receptors previously shown to play a role in angiogenesis. The reproducibility, evolutionary conservation and role in angiogenesis of the naturally occurring combinations of receptors are supported by multiple highly significant statistical tests from large datasets, including an independent validation set. We also show tissue-specific combinations and, in the case of choroid endothelial cells, consistency with both well-established and recent experimental findings, presented in a separate experimental paper. The results and methods presented here allow one small step forward in the understanding of the syntax of intercellular communication. AUTHOR SUMMARY Intercellular communication is essential for animal development and function and therefore it must have already been present when the first animals evolved, more than 600 million years ago. Many effective drugs act by modifying messages between cells. Thus, a fuller understanding of the language of cells should lead to the design of a wider range of safer, more effective drugs and drug combinations. In this paper we show an example of remarkable similarity in patterns of cellular communication between mice and humans, two species that began to diverge from their common ancestor approximately 75 million years ago. This paper focuses on combinations of signals important for the growth of blood vessels. The methods used, however, are of a general nature and take advantage of recent technology that is able to measure the quantities of molecules within a single cell. We hope that colleagues with expertise in different fields, science students, and people contemplating a career in science will be inspired by the prospect of one day fully understanding the ancient language of cells.","Domanskyi, Sergii; Hakansson, Alex; Meng, Michelle; Graff Zivin, Joshua S.; Piermarocchi, Carlo; Paternostro, Giovanni; Ferrara, Napoleone",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.04.425317,476

Design/methodology/approach: The study was qualitative focusing on a population of households of vulnerable and chronically ill patients in Mukono and Wakiso districts of Uganda. The sample was identified through purposive and snowball sampling techniques. Purposive and snowball sampling was chosen for this study to select unique informative cases which were subjected to in-depth interviews. Findings: The findings of the study revealed that disadvantaged and vulnerable citizens of Uganda experienced severe and increased shortages of food, increased cases of ill-health, compromised ability and mobility to access health services as a result of the government's Covid-19 mitigation model. Research limitations/implications: The data collection exercise was conducted during the Covid-19 lockdown when the mobility was restricted to only essential services so data was collected in the two districts of Mukono and Wakiso in Uganda. Practical implications: Pandemic mitigation models ought to be people-centred executed by a multidisciplinary team which are empathetic towards the views of disadvantaged communities and thereby cultivate a culture of care over time. Social implications: Public health models and policies work more effectively if they are contextualized to work for both the high and low classes of people across the whole spectrum. Originality/value: Given this awareness of the Covid-19 mitigation model, this paper unveils the immediate consequential effects of the model considering the manner under which it was formulated and implemented in the Ugandan society. While the government implemented the model in exercise of its obligations, contextual factors had advance limitations to the efficacy of the model.

The objective was to obtain an idea of how these virtual clubs work, the technological platforms used and the operating rules, and also to examine the composition of their memberships: Their sociodemographic profile, motivations, experiences, and evaluations. To this end, we carried out a review of studies and experiences of clubs of this type in Spain and then contacted 103 institutions, including public libraries and universities, in order to identify projects currently underway throughout the country. We were able to identify 24 virtual reading clubs, which we contacted once again to carry out our study. The conclusions shed light on the activities organized to encourage reading in Spain: The groups present a diverse set of operating rules and platforms, but the user profile is homogeneous and the assessments made by its participants are positive. These conclusions may help to identify good practices and may help to guide the design of new virtual reading clubs and the reorientation of those already in operation. The arrival of COVID-19 and the possible need to transform face-to-face reading clubs into virtual ones, will oblige these institutions to consider expanding the range of virtual activities on offer. © 2021 Centro de Estudios de PromociÃ³n de la Lectura y Literatura Infantil, Universidad de Castilla-La Manc.

Enisamium iodide (laboratory code FAV00A, trade name Amizon(R)) is an antiviral marketed in countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States for the treatment of viral respiratory infections, but its clinical efficacy and mode of action are not well understood. Here, we investigated the efficacy of FAV00A in patients aged between 18-60 years with confirmed influenza and other viral respiratory infections. FAV00A treatment resulted in reduced influenza virus shedding (at day 3, 71.2% in FAV00A group tested negative versus 25.0% in placebo group, p < 0.0001), faster patient recovery (at day 14, 93.9% in FAV00A group had recovered versus 32.5 % in placebo group, p < 0.0001), and reduced disease symptoms compared to placebo (from 9.6{+/-}0.7 to 4.6{+/-}0.9 score points in FAV00A group versus 9.7{+/-}1.1 to 5.6{+/-}1.1 score points in placebo group, p < 0.0001). Using mass-spectrometry, and cell-based and cell-free viral RNA synthesis assays, we identified a hydroxylated metabolite of FAV00A, VR17-04. VR17-04 is capable of inhibiting influenza virus RNA synthesis and present in plasma of patients treated with FAV00A. VR-17-04 inhibits the activity of the influenza virus RNA polymerase more potently than its parent compound. Overall, these results suggest that FAV00A is metabolized in humans to an inhibitor of the influenza virus RNA polymerase that reduces viral shedding and improves patient recovery in influenza patients.","Zubkova, T.

L1 and L3 are endemic to the Rim of the Indian Ocean, the region that accounts for most of the world’s new TB cases. Despite their relevance for this region, L1 and L3 remain understudied. Here we analyzed 2,938 L1 and 2,030 L3 whole genome sequences originating from 69 countries. We show that South Asia played a central role in the dispersion of these two lineages to neighboring regions. Moreover, we found that L1 exhibits signatures of local adaptation at the esxH locus, a gene coding for a secreted effector that targets the human endosomal sorting complex, and is included in several vaccine candidates. Our study highlights the importance of genetic diversity in the MTBC, and sheds new light on two of the most important MTBC lineages affecting humans.","Menardo, Fabrizio; Rutaihwa, Liliana K.; Zwyer, Michaela; Borrell, Sonia; Comas, Iñaki; Conceição, Emilyn Costa; Coscolla, Mireia; Cox, Helen; Joloba, Moses; Dou, Horng-Yunn; Feldmann, Julia; Fenner, Lukas; Fyfe, Janet; Gao, Qian; de Viedma, Darío García; Garcia-Basteiro, Alberto L.; Gygli, Sebastian M.; Hella, Jerry; Hiza, Hellen; Jugheli, Levan; Kamwela, Lujeko; Kato-Maeda, Midori; Liu, Qingyun; Ley, Serej D.; Loiseau, Chloe; Mahasirimongkol, Surakameth; Malla, Bijaya; Palittapongarnpim, Prasit; Rakotosamimanana, Niaina; Rasolofo, Voahangy; Reinhard, Miriam; Reither, Klaus; Sasamalo, Mohamed; Duarte, Rafael Silva; Sola, Christophe; Suffys, Philip; Lima, Karla Valeria Batista; Yeboah-Manu, Dorothy; Beisel, Christian; Brites, Daniela; Gagneux, Sebastien",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.20.346866,476

166703,COVID-19 and the Anatomy of the Rally Effect in Taiwan,2021,"Glycans of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein are speculated to play functional roles in the infection processes as they extensively cover the protein surface and are highly conserved across the variants. To date, the spike protein has become the principal target for vaccine and therapeutic development while the exact effects of its glycosylation remain elusive. Experimental reports have described the heterogeneity of the spike protein glycosylation profile. Subsequent molecular simulation studies provided a knowledge basis of the glycan functions. However, there are no studies to date on the role of discrete glycoforms on the spike protein pathobiology. Building an understanding of its role in SARS-CoV-2 is important as we continue to develop effective medicines and vaccines to combat the disease. Herein, we used designed combinations of glycoengineering enzymes to simplify and control the glycosylation profile of the spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD). Measurements of the receptor binding affinity revealed the regulatory effects of the RBD glycans. Remarkably, opposite effects were observed from differently remodeled glycans, which presents a potential strategy for modulating the spike protein behaviors through glycoengineering. Moreover, we found that the reported anti-SARS-CoV-(2) antibody, S309, neutralizes the impact of different RBD glycoforms on the receptor binding affinity. Overall, this work reports the regulatory roles that glycosylation plays in the interaction between the viral spike protein and host receptor, providing new insights into the nature of SARS-CoV-2. Beyond this study, enzymatic remodeling of glycosylation offers the opportunity to understand the fundamental role of specific glycoforms on glycoconjugates across molecular biology. Covert art Legends The glycosylation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain has regulatory effects on the receptor binding affinity. Sialylation or not determines the “stabilizing” or “destabilizing” effect of the glycans. (Protein structure model is adapted from Protein Data Bank: 6moj. The original model does not contain the glycan structure.) Significance Glycans extensively cover the surface of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein but the relationships between the glycan structures and the protein pathological behaviors remain elusive. Herein, we simplified and harmonized the glycan structures in the S protein receptor-binding domain and reported their regulatory roles in human receptor interaction. Opposite regulatory effects were observed and were determined by discrete glycan structures, which can be neutralized by the reported S309 antibody binding to the S protein. This report provides new insight into the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 S protein infection as well as S309 neutralization.","Hsu, Yen-Pang; Mukherjee, Debopreeti; Shchurik, Vladimir; Makarov, Alexey; Mann, Benjamin F.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.26.457782,476

Design/methodology/approach: A COVID-19 outbreak that initially clustered in IMWs and further contributed to the resurgence of the disease across Thailand in December 2020 was analyzed to address the deficiencies in public health services based on the framework of the 10 Essential Public Health Services (EPHS). The EPHS framework was also applied to develop policy options and recommendations in the subsequent policy brief. Findings: This outbreak unveiled unique challenges that make IMWs more vulnerable to COVID-19. The public health system, challenged by the COVID-19 outbreak among IMWs, manifested deficiencies in the planning and implementation of all essential services. Delayed detection of the outbreak along with the lack of policy accommodating undocumented IMWs and the lack of equitable access to testing and treatment for COVID-19 resulted in the transmission of the disease that harmed the public at large. Originality/value: The comprehensive analysis of the deficiencies in public health services for IMWs enabled a clear description of problems that could be further prioritized by relevant stakeholders. The policy brief provides policymakers with evidence-based recommendations for improving public health services for IMWs during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. © 2021, Chanapong Rojanaworarit and Sarah El Bouzaidi.","Rojanaworarit, C.; El Bouzaidi, S.",Journal of Health Research,https://doi.org/10.1108/jhr-01-2021-0035,476

The COVID-19 epidemic is dispersing all over the world in a few months. The traditional health care systems face new challenges associated with the constant increase of patients with this disease. This epidemic has caused a mess worldwide. In India, cases are increased day by day. Due to COVID-19, countries have a huge loss which cannot be estimated both in the economy and life of citizens. To recover this economic loss and save the life, deployment of emerging technologies is used to battle this invisible enemy. During this period, several researchers have written lots of research papers in various fields. The main aim of this chapter is to summarize the existing literature addressing the use of computational intelligence (CI) technologies to battle COVID-19 infection. Nowadays researchers have been analyzed the data related to COVID-19 and draw some conclusions by applying emerging technologies like AI, IoT, deep learning, Blockchain, Neural Network, Fuzzy, and machine learning algorithms. These strategies help policymakers and frontline people to take additional steps by avoiding the unfold of the virus and manage the disease.

Despite the increasing research-based publications and practices relating to Chinese language textbooks, there is a dearth of assessment indicators weight systems constructed by alternative research tools and statistical methods to evaluate the quality of the growing digital business Chinese materials. To the best of our knowledge, no literature review has been published on using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method to construct the assessment indicators of digital business Chinese materials. Therefore, this study aims to fill this gap by reviewing the existing, but limited, literature and providing recommendations for developing a checklist—based on the assessment indicators weight system—to evaluate digital business Chinese materials. The preliminary PC2U (Production, Content, Use, and Usefulness) assessment indicators are constructed based on the current research on business Chinese, CLTML, and relevant assessment indicators. In addition, the analysis hierarchy process (AHP) is used to construct the weight system. The results show that it is crucial to prioritize the access of digital business Chinese content. Of the three criteria in the content dimension, learning needs and credibility are equally important, and both are more important than data update. The assessment indicators are not only beneficial to fill the knowledge gap on business Chinese research, but also helpful for publishers and teachers to compile and select high quality digital business Chinese materials. © The Author(s) 2021.","Cai, Q.

167787,Spatial Modelling of Modal Shift Due to COVID-19,2021,"This study theoretically examines to what extent a perspective of political election affects optimal lockdown policy at the outbreak of an epidemic. We employ the SIR-macro model in which the incumbent government aims at optimizing social welfare in the periods before polling day to maximize its election result. As a novelty, the substantial uncertainty with regard to the true characteristics of the epidemic faced by the economic agents is taken into account. The results reveal that the optimal lockdown policy crucially depends on the time to the polling day. If it is not longer than several months, the government tends to introduce immediate and more severe restrictions compared to the no-election case. On the other hand, if the election day is later, the optimal policy is to delay launching containment measures. Interestingly, it is difficult to assess which strategy is better in terms of lives saved. While postponing the reaction may result in a significant rise in casualties, an immediate and strict lockdown may also be inefficient in restraining the epidemic.","Acedański, Jan",Economic Analysis and Policy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eap.2021.07.013,476

Small business cyber-security discussions to date have been narrow in focus and lack re-usability beyond specific circumstances. Our study uses global evidence from industry, government and research communities across multiple disciplines. We explore the technical and non-technical factors negatively impacting a small business' ability to safeguard itself, such as resource constraints, organisational process maturity, and legal structures. Our research shows that some small business characteristics, such as agility, large cohort size, and piecemeal IT architecture, could allow for increased cyber-security. We conclude that there is a gap in current research in small business cyber-security. In addition, legal and policy work are needed to help small businesses become cyber-resilient.","Tam, Tracy; Rao, Asha; Hall, Joanne",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.00733v1.pdf,476

Without using any explicit details of any gravity model, we study the behaviour of the circuit complexity function with respect to the dynamical cosmological solution for the scale factors for the above-mentioned two situations in FLRW space-time using squeezed state formalism. By studying the cosmological circuit complexity, Out-of-Time Ordered Correlators, and entanglement entropy of the modes of the squeezed state, in different parameter spaces, we conclude the non-universality of these measures. Their remarkably different features in the different parameter spaces suggest their dependence on the parameters of the model under consideration.","Choudhury, Sayantan; Chowdhury, Satyaki; Gupta, Nitin; Mishara, Anurag; Selvam, Sachin Panneer; Panda, Sudhakar; D.Pasquino, Gabriel; Singha, Chiranjeeb; Swain, Abinash",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.10234v5.pdf,476

The Covid-19 outbreak and its effect on agricultural supply in Turkey,2021,"Predicting how actions result in conflicting outcomes for self and others is essential for social functioning. We tested whether Reinforcement Learning Theory captures how participants learn to choose between symbols that define a moral conflict between financial self-gain and other-pain. We tested whether choices are better explained by model-free learning (decisions based on combined historical values of past outcomes), or model-based learning (decisions based on the current value of separately expected outcomes) by including trials in which participants know that either self-gain or other-pain will not be delivered. Some participants favored options benefiting themselves, others, preventing other-pain. When removing the favored outcome, participants instantly altered their choices, suggesting model-based learning. Computational modelling confirmed choices were best described by model-based learning in which participants track expected values of self-gain and other-pain separately, with an individual valuation parameter capturing their relative weight. This valuation parameter predicted costly helping in an independent task. The expectations of self-gain and other-pain were also biased: the favoured outcome was associated with more differentiated symbol-outcome probability reports than the less favoured outcome. FMRI helped localize this bias: signals in the pain-observation network covaried with pain prediction errors without linear dependency on individual preferences, while the ventromedial prefrontal cortex contained separable signals covarying with pain prediction errors in ways that did and did not reflected individual preferences.","Fornari, L.; Ioumpa, K.; Nostro, A.

All health care workers, especially otorhinolaryngologists, respiratory medicine physicians, and general medicine physicians, are more exposed to the virus daily, as they work closely with COVID 19 positive patients while treating them. Otorhinolaryngologists deal with patients' nasal and oral cavities daily, making them one of the most exposed categories of health-care workers. Thus, it is extremely important to remain vigilant when examining patients in OPD wards and performing surgeries in the operating room.

169559,Dominant factors determining differences of COVID-19 fatalities between India and other large-population regions,2020,"Human procalcitonin (PCT) is a peptide precursor of the calcium-regulating hormone calcitonin. Traditionally, PCT has been used as a biomarker for severe bacterial infections and sepsis. It has also been recently identified as a potential marker for COVID-19. Normally, serum PCT is intracellularly cleaved to calcitonin, which lowers the levels of PCT (&lt;0.01 ng/mL). In severe infectious diseases and sepsis, serum PCT levels increase above 100 ng/mL in response to pro-inflammatory stimulation. Development of sensors for specific quantification of PCT has resulted in considerable improvement in the sensitivity, linear range and rapid response. Among the various sensing strategies, electrochemical platforms have been extensively investigated owing to their cost-effectiveness, ease of fabrication and portability. Sandwich-type electrochemical immunoassays based on the specific antigen–antibody interactions with an electrochemical transducer and use of nanointerfaces has augmented the electrochemical response of the sensors towards PCT. Identification of a superior combination of electrode material and nanointerface, and translation of the sensing platform into flexible and disposable substrates are under active investigation towards development of a point-of-care device for PCT detection.

The study was aimed to observe the current sero-prevalence status of MERS-CoV, assess the presence of active cases through detection RNA Viral particle and investigate possible risk factors of MERS-CoV in camels. A total of 589 sera were collected and tested with indirect Enzyme linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (iELISA). Result The overall seroprevalance of MERS-CoV was 87.3% (n=514/589, 95% CI: 84.5-89.9). Association of different risk factors with seroprevalance revealed that origin (X2=13.39,P=0.001), sex (X2=4.5 P=0.034), age ((X2=185.7, P=0.001) season (X2=41.7, P=0.000) and reproduction status (X2=96.1, P=0.001) displayed a statistical significant difference among the groups (P<0.05) while herd size did not show a Significant difference among groups (p>0.05). In multivariable logistic regression analysis, age (OR=7.39, 95% CI:3.43-15.91), season (OR=4.83, 95% CI:-2.14-10.90), and in adult female camel reproduction status (OR=7.39,95% C I:3.43-15.91) showed statistically significant difference among the groups for MERS CoV antibody detection while risk factors of origin, animal sex and herd size difference were statistically insignificant. A total of 857 nasal swab samples were collected for the detection of MERS-CoV RNA particle. However, all swab samples tested by Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique were Negative for the virus. Conclusion In conclusion, the present study revealed a high seroprevalance of MERS CoV in adult camels. However, in spite of high seroprevalance the lack of any RNA viral particle in the study suggests the need for further in depth longitudinal study to detect the circulating virus focusing on juveniles and young camels whereby seroprevalance of antibody is low when compared with adult camel in order to get the active virus before the camel develop antibody. Moreover, the zoonotic significance and potential transmission routes of MERS CoV to pastoral communities should also be investigated and design strategy for the preparedness in control of the diseases in Ethiopia.","Sibhatu, Demeke; Mamo, Gezahagne; Aklillu, Fasil; Zewde, Demeke; Walelign, Elias; Muluneh, Ayelech; Aliey, Abdi; Mirkena, Tadele; Tewolde, Nega; Gari, Getachew; van ‘t Klooster, Gijs; Elmasry, Ihab; VonDobschuetz, Sophie; Peiris, Malik; Chu, Daniel; Perera, Ranawaka APM; Jobire, Yilma",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.25.353227,476

170154,Virtual Coaching Delivered by Pharmacists to Prevent COVID-19 Transmission,2021,"Object recognition has made great advances in the last decade, but predominately still relies on many high-quality training examples per object category. In contrast, learning new objects from only a few examples could enable many impactful applications from robotics to user personalization. Most few-shot learning research, however, has been driven by benchmark datasets that lack the high variation that these applications will face when deployed in the real-world. To close this gap, we present the ORBIT dataset and benchmark, grounded in the real-world application of teachable object recognizers for people who are blind/low-vision. The dataset contains 3,822 videos of 486 objects recorded by people who are blind/low-vision on their mobile phones. The benchmark reflects a realistic, highly challenging recognition problem, providing a rich playground to drive research in robustness to few-shot, high-variation conditions. We set the benchmark's first state-of-the-art and show there is massive scope for further innovation, holding the potential to impact a broad range of real-world vision applications including tools for the blind/low-vision community.

However, the prevalence of previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 in university students, including symptomatic and asymptomatic disease, is unknown. Objective: To determine the prevalence of previous infection, risk factors for infection, and the prevalence of persistent symptoms following infection among university students. Design: This was a cross-sectional study that surveyed students about demographics, risk factors, and symptoms, and simultaneously tested their saliva for IgA antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. To estimate the prevalence of previous infection we adjusted our intentional sample of a diverse student population for year in school and age to resemble the composition of the entire student body, and adjusted for the imperfect sensitivity and specificity of the antibody test. Univariate and multivariate analysis was used to identify independent risk factors for infection. Setting: A large public university in Athens, Georgia between January 22 and March 22, 2021. Participants: Undergraduate and graduate students; 488 completed the survey, 432 had a valid antibody result. and 428 had both. Exposure: Previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 based on measurement of IgA antibodies in saliva and adjustment for sample characteristics and test accuracy. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the estimated prevalence of previous infection with SARS-CoV-2. Secondary outcomes were independent risk factors for infection, and the prevalence of persistent symptoms among persons reporting a previous symptomatic infection. Results: The estimated prevalence of previous infection for 432 participants with valid antibody results was between 41% and 42%. Independent risk factors for infection included male sex, having a roommate with a known symptomatic infection, and having 2 or fewer roommates. More frequent attendance of parties and bars was a univariate risk factor, but not in the multivariate analysis. Of 122 students reporting a previous symptomatic infection, 14 (11.4%) reported persistent symptoms a median of 132 days later. Conclusions and Relevance: Previous infection with SARS-CoV-2, both symptomatic and asymptomatic, was common at a large university. Measures that could prevent resurgence of the infection when students return to campus include mandatory vaccination policies, mass surveillance testing, and testing of sewage for antigen to SARS-CoV-2.","Ebell, M.

Consequently, these have the potential to generate large footprints in the online and social media image records which may be valuable for ecological research. Cherry tree blooms are one such event, especially in Japan where they are a cultural symbol (Sakura, 桜). For centuries, the Japanese have celebrated Hanami (flower viewing) and the historical data record of the festival allows for phenological studies over this period, one application of which is climate reconstruction. Here we analyse Flickr social network site data in an analogous way to reveal the cherry blossoms’ seasonal sweep from southern to northern Japan over a twelve-week period. Our method analyses data filtered using geographical constraints, multi-stage text-tag classification, and machine vision, to assess image content for relevance to our research question and use it to estimate historic cherry bloom times. We validated our estimated bloom times against official data, demonstrating the accuracy of the approach. We also investigated an out of season Autumn blooming that has gained worldwide media attention. Despite the complexity of human photographic and social media activity and the relatively small scale of this event, our method can reveal that this bloom has in fact been occurring over a decade. The approach we propose in our case study enables quick and effective monitoring of the photogenic spatiotemporal aspects of our rapidly changing world.

170925,Analyzing Zoombombing as a new communication tool of cyberhate in the COVID-19 era,2021,"Machine learning requires a large volume of sample data, especially when it is used in high-accuracy medical applications. However, patient records are one of the most sensitive private information that is not usually shared among institutes. This paper presents spatio-temporal split learning, a distributed deep neural network framework, which is a turning point in allowing collaboration among privacy-sensitive organizations. Our spatio-temporal split learning presents how distributed machine learning can be efficiently conducted with minimal privacy concerns. The proposed split learning consists of a number of clients and a centralized server. Each client has only has one hidden layer, which acts as the privacy-preserving layer, and the centralized server comprises the other hidden layers and the output layer. Since the centralized server does not need to access the training data and trains the deep neural network with parameters received from the privacy-preserving layer, privacy of original data is guaranteed. We have coined the term, spatio-temporal split learning, as multiple clients are spatially distributed to cover diverse datasets from different participants, and we can temporally split the learning process, detaching the privacy preserving layer from the rest of the learning process to minimize privacy breaches. This paper shows how we can analyze the medical data whilst ensuring privacy using our proposed multi-site spatio-temporal split learning algorithm on Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) chest Computed Tomography (CT) scans, MUsculoskeletal RAdiographs (MURA) X-ray images, and cholesterol levels.

171243,Anticoagulants and Antiplatelets in COVID-19: Impact on Survival and Thromboembolism Development,2021-07-07,"Background: The ongoing Coronavirus-19 disease epidemic is a public health emergency of international concern which could pose a challenge to psychological resilience. This is mainly the case of patients with rheumatic diseases (RD). Objectives: The aim of this study was to establish the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms in patients with RD and to identify factors associated with psychological stress. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among patients with RD. They were invited to respond to a survey designed to assess their psychological response after the outbreak of the SARS-COV2 pandemic. Mental health status after the Covid-19 was evaluated using the Depression and Anxiety Scale (DASS-21). The total depression subscale score was divided into normal (0-9), mild depression (10-12), moderate depression (13-20), severe depression (21-27), and extremely severe depression (28-42). The total anxiety subscale score was divided into normal (0-6), mild anxiety (7-9), moderate anxiety (10-14), severe anxiety (15-19), and extremely severe anxiety (20-42).The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) is a 22-item self-administered questionnaire that assesses the post-traumatic state (PTS). A cut-off point of 33 provided the best diagnostic accuracy for PTS. The level of significance was fixed at 0.05. Results: Sixty patients were included (42 with rheumatoid arthritis and 18 with spondylarthritis) with a mean age of 51.3 ± 13.1 years [18-75]. The majority of patients were women (63.3%), married (81.7%), with a household size of 3-5 people (67.9%). The mean disease duration was 11.9 ±5.6 [1-23] years. According to DASS depression score almost half of the patients (47%) suffered from depression, which was classified as severe in 10% of cases. The mean DASS anxiety subscale was 12.6 ± 8.2 [1-35]. The level of anxiety was mild in 23% of cases, moderate in 25% of cases, and severe in 23.3% of cases. The mean ILES-R score was 20.4 ± 10.2 [20-38]. Women experienced more PTS than men (26.3% vs 22.7%) without reaching a statistically significant correlation (p=0.9). Patients with higher education had lower IES-R, depression, and anxiety subscale scores as compared to those who were illiterate without a statistically significant correlation (p=0.5, p=0.2, p=0.4 respectively). A positive correlation was found between anxiety score and IES-R (p=0.00). Other sociodemographic variables including disease duration, parental status, marital status, and household size were not associated with IES-R and DASS subscale scores (p>0.05). Conclusion: Our study showed that many of our patients with RD experienced anxiety, depression, and PTS after the outbreak of Covid-19. Professional status as well as other sociodemographic data was not associated with psychological stress.","Yasmine, M.; Mariem, S.; Miladi, S.; Fazaa, A.; Souebni, L.; Ouenniche, K.; Kassab, S.; Chekili, S.; Ben Abdelghani, K.; Laatar, A.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-eular.2116,476

ACEs, associated with negative health behaviors and chronic health disorders, disproportionately impact people from poor and marginalized communities. Toxic stress from ACEs can be prevented and treated with trauma-informed care. Inadequate training prevents the maternal and child workforce from providing evidence-based trauma-informed care. Cross-sector collaboration between pediatric care sectors is crucial to providing systems-wide trauma-informed care, but significant barriers impede cross sector communication. Training and formal cross-sector communication networks are needed to create strong systems of trauma-informed care in communities. The Stanford ACEs Aware ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) program was created with 3 workforce development goals: 1) introduce the California Office of Surgeon General-led ACEs Aware Initiative to the maternal and child health workforce in 3 California counties, 2) disseminate trauma-informed evidence-based best practices, 3) bridge community silos to increase collaboration between care sectors to promote trauma-informed care systems. Methods Participants were recruited from Federally Qualified Health Centers, county public health departments, community behavioral health organizations, educational institutions, and agencies that serve low-income children and families. 100 unique participants representing 3 counties and 54 agencies joined sessions. Twelve virtual educational sessions were convened over 6 months using the Project ECHO model via Zoom technology. Sessions consisted of didactic lectures and whole-group case-based discussions. Results After completing the educational series, participants expressed commitment to increased cross-sector collaboration, and reported increased knowledge and confidence in using trauma-informed skills. After participation, a significant number of participants had also completed another recommended California ACEs Aware Initiative online training. Conclusion An ECHO series of virtual workforce development sessions on trauma-informed best practices promoted cross-sector communication and was associated with strong participant engagement and satisfaction.

An objective estimation of the probability of cases arising in the future is important to reduce the risk of post-declaration flare-ups. We developed a simulation-based model to quantify that probability. We tested it on simulated Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) data and found this probability was most sensitive to the instantaneous reproduction number, the reporting rate, and the delay between symptom onset and recovery or death of the last detected case. For EVD, our results suggest that the current WHO criterion of 42 days since the outcome of the last detected case is too short and very sensitive to underreporting. The 90 days of enhanced surveillance period after the end-of-outbreak declaration is therefore crucial to capture potential flare-ups of cases. Hence, we suggest a shift to a preliminary end-of-outbreak declaration after 63 days from the symptom onset day of the last detected case. This should be followed by a 90-day enhanced surveillance, after which the official end-of-outbreak can be declared. This corresponds to less than 5% probability of flare ups in most of the scenarios examined. Our quantitative framework could be adapted to define end-of-outbreak criteria for other infectious diseases.","Djaafara, Bimandra A; Imai, Natsuko; Hamblion, Esther; Impouma, Benido; Donnelly, Christl A; Cori, Anne",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.17.20024042,476

172216,Structural and Magnetic Transitions in the Planar Antiferromagnet Ba$_4$Ir$_3$O$_{10}$,2021-03-24,"Previous studies show that public discourse and social media discourse around the Covid-19 pandemic heavily use war framing, despite the fact that its misuse and inaptness to elaborate all aspects of the pandemic were already noted. This paper analyses conceptual metaphors in the Croatian (social) media discourse on the pandemic, focusing on the war metaphor. Using a specialized corpus of manually chosen relevant texts in Croatian, compiled for this purpose, we investigate how frequent war framing is in the Croatian media compared to alternative figurative framings. In a qualitative analysis, we outline the conceptual and inferential structure of the Covid-19 pandemic concept and discuss the structure, function, and (in)aptness of the war metaphor in pandemic circumstances. Additionally, by detecting other source frames used in this discourse, we offer other, possibly more apt (or less resisted) framing options – or a so-called metaphor menu – designed specifically for the Croatian language based on corpus data. We show that the Covid-19 pandemic is predominantly framed as combat or war in Croatian media and social media. Even though a ‘war’ on the war metaphor has been declared both by the media and research community, we show that the use of certain other source frames (e.g. the religion frame) may be even more dangerous than the war framing. The paper also discusses the aptness and omnipresence of the war metaphor, as well as its inaptness to refer to all aspects of this pandemic, concluding that it is rarely the type of metaphor that is harmful or inappropriate – it is rather the effect of the context and how it is used. © 2021 Institute of Croatian Language and Linguistics.

We apply a three-fold approach of using traditional machine learning models using handcrafted features, convolutional neural networks on spectrograms and recurrent neural networks on instantaneous audio features, to perform a binary classification of whether a person is COVID-positive or not. We provide a description of the preprocessing techniques, feature extraction pipeline, model building and a summary of the performance of each of the three approaches.

It featured in thousands of academic publications and received widespread attention from policymakers and the media. In this article, we trace the origins and use of the ‘infodemic’ metaphor and examine the blind spots inherent in this seemingly intuitive term. Drawing from literature in the cognitive sciences and communication studies, we show why information does not spread like a virus and point out how the ‘infodemic’ metaphor can be misleading, as it conflates multiple forms of social behaviour, oversimplifies a complex situation and helps constitute a phenomenon for which concrete evidence remains patchy. We point out the existing tension between the usefulness of the widespread use of the term ‘infodemic’ and its uncritical adoption, which we argue can do more harm than good, potentially diluting the quality of academic work, public discourse and contributing to state overreach in policymaking.

However, there is no significant effect of the pandemic on anthropometric characteristics, balance, and flexibility (p>0.05). The effects of the pandemic on the health of the children living in Kosovo were less in comparison with the effects of the pandemic reported by the World Health Organization and other countries. Moreover, the study also showed decreases in motor abilities in the years when the COVID-19 pandemic had not occurred.","Berisha, M.; Thaqi, A.",Turkish Journal of Kinesiology,https://doi.org/10.31459/turkjkin.932102,476

Understand how the clinical simulation was perceived.MethodsAfter the beginning of the pandemic, the Simulation Center delivered some sessions to explain the theoretical and practical approaches of the project;8 hospitals and 9 primary care centers were selected for the in situ simulations, mostly aimed at strengthening the daily tasks of all those involved in the patient care process: stretcher handlers, nurses, physicians, housekeepers, and administrative staff. Either actors, manikins, or part-task trainers portrayed COVID-19 patients.Results and Discussion1789 health workers were trained. The in situ simulation disclosed the need to revisit technical and non-technical skills in real-time. Process non-apparent errors were detected: physical space, resources, signs, inter-service communication as well as the participants’ strengths and weaknesses.The simulation helps creating and recreating the necessary conditions to bond and produce knowledge from simple to complex scenarios. The project intends to directly improve patients and health workers’ safety by highlighting the relevance of teamwork and enhanced staff trust in the institutions.

Methods: We determined IgG and NAb against SARS-CoV-2 variants one year following mild wild-type infection (n=104) and two-dose regimens with BNT162b2 (BNT/BNT) (n=67), ChAdOx1 (ChAd/ChAd) (n=82), or heterologous ChAdOx1 followed by BNT162b2 (ChAd/BNT) (n=116). Findings: Wild type spike IgG and NAb remained detectable in 80% (83/104) of unvaccinated participants one year post mild infection. The neutralizing capacity was similar against wild type (reference), Alpha (0.95 (0.92-0.98) and Delta 1.03 (0.95-1.11) but significantly reduced against Beta (0.54 (0.48-0.60)) and Gamma 0.51 (0.44-0.61). Similarly, BNT/BNT and ChAd/ChAd elicited sustained capacity against Alpha and Delta (1.01 (0.78-1.31) and 1.03 (0.95-1.11)) and (0.96 (0.84-1.09) and 0.82 (0.61-1.10) respectively), with reduced capacity against Beta (0.67 (0.50-0.88) and 0.53 (0.40-0.71)) and Gamma (0.12 (0.06-0.27) and 0.54 (0.37-0.80)). A similar trend was found following ChAd/BNT (0.74 (0.66-0.83) and 0.70 (0.50-0.97) against Alpha and Delta and 0.29 (0.20-0.42) and 0.13 (0.08-0.20) against Beta and Gamma). Interpretation: Persistent neutralization of the wide-spread Alpha and Delta variants one year after wild-type infection may aid vaccine policy makers in low-resource settings when prioritizing vaccine supply. The reduced capacity of neutralizing Beta and Gamma strains, but not the Alpha and Delta strains following both infection and three different vaccine regimens argues for caution against Beta and Gamma-exclusive mutations in the efforts to optimize next generation SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.

Theoretically, this article takes its point of departure in a sociological interest for how people make sense of uncertainty, here exemplified by everyday life during the Covid-19 pandemic. The results show that the interviewees support the Swedish strategy and its scientific ground at the same time as they experience uncertainty in how this strategy should be transformed into everyday practices.

Objectives: We aimed to determine the prognostic value of Krebs von De Lungen-6 circulating serum levels (sKL-6) predicting COVID-19 evolving trends. Methods: We prospectively analyzed the clinical and laboratory characteristics of 375 COVID-19 patients with mild lung disease on admission. sKL-6 was obtained in all patients at baseline and compared among patients with respiratory worsening. Results: 45.1% of patients developed respiratory worsening during hospitalization. Baseline sKL-6 levels were higher in patients who had respiratory worsening (median [IQR] 303 [209-449] vs. 285.5 [15.8-5724], P=0.068). The best sKL-6 cut-off point was 408 U/mL (area under the curve 0.55;33% sensitivity, 79% specificity). Independent predictors of respiratory worsening were sKL-6 serum levels, age >51 years, time hospitalized, and dyspnea on admission. Patients with baseline sKL-6 ≥ 408 U/mL had a 39% higher risk of developing respiratory aggravation seven days after admission. In patients with serial determinations, sKL-6 was also higher in those who subsequently worsened (median [IQR] 330 [219-460] vs 290.5 [193-396];p<0.02). Conclusion: sKL-6 has a low sensibility to predict respiratory worsening in patients with mild COVID-19 pneumonia. Baseline sKL-6 ≥ 408 U/mL is associated to a higher risk of respiratory worsening. sKL-6 levels are not useful as a screening tool to stratify patients on admission but further research is needed to investigate if serial determinations of sKL-6 may be of prognostic use.","Lobo Prat, D.; Castellví, I.; Castillo, D.; Orozco, S.; Mariscal, A.; Martínez-Martínez, L.; Millán Arciniegas, A.

The principal contribution is presenting an economics–accounting nexus for government assistance to firms during a pandemic and for the nation’s economic development.Design/methodology/approachThis is a descriptive study that draws on the economic theory of regulation to understand the rationale for wealth transfers, then examining the accounting for the wealth transfers by analyzing the financial statements of NZX 50 companies that received the wage subsidy and SkyCity and Chorus that received substantial grants to develop and operate the New Zealand International Convention Centre and building a large part of New Zealand’s Ultra-Fast Broadband fiber optic network, respectively.FindingsFirst, the 10 NZX 50 companies that received the government’s wage subsidy were justified to receive it from the legal, ethical and moral perspectives. However, some non-NZX 50 companies, while legally entitled to the wage subsidy, took advantage of the wealth transfer when they were profitable and paid dividends. This latter group of companies was not seen as behaving ethically and morally. Second, the government granted millions of dollars to SkyCity and Chorus for building critical infrastructures that are economically beneficial for the nation and that are unlikely to attract private investment, and these companies accounted for the grants related to assets in accordance with NZ IAS 20.Research limitations/implicationsThe financial statement impacts of the wage subsidy are based on a subset of NZX 50 companies with available information at the time of writing. However, they do not compromise the external validity of the findings because the wage subsidy applies to all businesses. Similarly, the manner in which SkyCity and Chorus accounted for the grants related to assets would apply equally to any entity that is a recipient of such a grant.Originality/valueThis paper presents an economic understanding for the existence of government grants and how the accounting mirrors the economic rationale for the “grants related to income” and “grants related to assets.” This paper demonstrates the importance of the economics–accounting nexus.","Wong, Jilnaught Wong Norman",Pacific Accounting Review,https://doi.org/10.1108/par-10-2020-0189,476

The non-structural proteins carry out activities critical for viral functions, and the structural proteins play a significant role in viral assembly and structure. The zoonotic nature of coronaviruses is responsible for the past epidemics and the current pandemic. The current global pandemic of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 has caused infections worldwide and now crossed over a million fatalities. The high transmission rate of the virus has caused new cases emerging every day. While vaccines remain an ideal solution, it is also important to identify alternative potential small molecules and other inhibitors against molecular targets of SARS-CoV-2. The present chapter describes the current scenario of the world facing the COVID-19 pandemic and details the molecular machinery of the causative agent, i.e., SARS-CoV-2. It discusses the role of drug repurposing against SARS-CoV-2 and explains its methodology.

The review found that multiple factors are suggested as being associated with best practice in supporting resilience and retention, but few have been tested robustly. The thematic synthesis of these identified the analytical themes of - Culture of Care; Content of Work; Connectedness with Colleagues; Characteristics and Competencies of Care Home Leaders and Caring during a Crisis. The evidence base must move from its current state of implicitness. Only then can it inform intervention development, implementation strategies and meaningful indicators of success.

In the business landscape, its effects may be more detrimental to micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) because they tend to have limited financial and human resources to manage the challenges caused by COVID-19. To help MSMEs enhance their resilience, this paper aims to discuss how they can leverage mass collaboration to build social media-based knowledge ecosystems to manage interactions among internal and external stakeholders for knowledge creation and innovation. Design/methodology/approach: The paper proposes a model for MSMEs to build an online knowledge ecosystem and a standalone text analytics tool to use the advanced data analytics, e.g. topic modeling, to analyze and aggregate collective insights. Design science research methodology is used to develop the model and the tool. Findings: Through mass collaboration using social media and advanced data analytics technology, MSMEs can generate new business ideas, leading to enhanced resilience to meet the challenges caused by COVID-19 or other unexpected or extraordinary circumstances, such as natural disasters and financial crises.

Studies have shown that the COVID-19 pandemic has reduced social connectedness and negatively impacted workplace social capital in many non-medical professions, yet studies are limited in the medical field, particularly with physicians. This project sought to uncover resident physician perspectives on the impact of COVID-19 on professional relationships and to gain ideas on how to optimize workplace social capital despite and beyond the current limitations of the pandemic. Methods: This study was conducted at a single academic hospital in the United States between March-April 2021. Data was collected from emergency medicine residents via open-ended response online surveys and a semi-structured focus group discussion. A team of three investigators independently analyzed data from open-ended survey responses and the focus group transcription, using a grounded-theory approach and consensus of the independent analyses was subsequently generated to identify final themes and subthemes. Results: Three main themes regarding resident perspective on professional interpersonal relationships and social capital were identified: team, trust, and support. We also report the 6 core factors discussed by residents that have changed secondary to the COVID-19 pandemic. EM resident physicians feel that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted environment, socialization, staff turnover, teaching/debriefing, capacity limits and approach to education, which have demonstrated an overall negative impact on interpersonal relationships and social capital. It has also, however, positively impacted a sense of unity within the emergency department team that residents feel has enhanced relationships and social capital. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic will have lasting impacts on the way our hospitals and residencies function. The findings of this study may help to ignite discussion on how we can build on the positive, while limit the negative impacting features that have been shaped from the COVID-19 pandemic.

176221,Comments on the Article “monitoring Covid-19 Is like Instrument Flying”,2021,"Background: Social distancing has been recommended by the CDC to avoid exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Cancer patients on or after active therapy appear to be more prone to COVID being symptomatic and life threatening. When evaluating cancer patients' risk of acquiring COVID it is essential to know the behavior of cancer patients that will affect their risk of exposure. However, it is not known to what degree social distancing is practiced by cancer patients compared to non-cancer patients and what factors lead to the decision to distance oneself. Methods: After a pilot phase using patients MyChart messaging, links to the electronic questionnaires were texted to patients using Twillio. Responses were stored on REDCap. Six questions about their social distancing behavior and mask wearing were posed and responses were compared between cancer and non-cancer patients. Demographics, comorbidities and a questionnaire about anxiety (GAD-7 scale for Generalized Anxiety Disorder) were recorded. To assess differences between cancer and non-cancer groups Bonferroni-corrected chi-square tests and proportions confidence intervals were used. Results: The pilot survey was sent in mid-2020 and the full survey followed in January 2021 during a high community COVID incidence. 387 cancer patients (32.4% responded and 503 noncancer (22.9% responded) patients completed the survey. Questions about leaving their house, driving, shopping, friends and family indicated that patients with cancer are more cautious (p &lt; 0.001). Cancer patients were up to 20% more likely to distance themselves. No evidence of a difference was seen in wearing a mask, at least 85 % most of the time. A majority of respondents were female (63% vs 71%). Cancer patients were older ( &gt; 60 years, 69 % vs 45%) and less likely to work (52% vs 31%) or less likely to be white collar workers (21% vs 38%). There was no difference of the anxiety score in both groups (not at all anxious, 54%). Conclusions: Cancer patients' responses revealed a distancing behavior that would likely lower the risk exposure to SARS-CoV-2. It is unclear, which of the demographic differences would account for this behavior, although remarkably anxiety was not a clear motivating factor. The high acceptance of masks is encouraging. Early publications during the pandemic and patient education suggesting a higher COVID risk for cancer patients may have reduced risk prone behavior. Considering COVID's impact on the vulnerable cancer population and uncertainty in immunosuppressed patients about clearing the virus or adequately responding to a vaccine, further studies about health behavior and health promotion during the pandemic are needed.","Kloecker, G.

176448,"COVID-19, paradoxes, and new business models. An opportunity for third sector organizations? [Italian]",2021,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyze how fashion consumers behave when they make purchases using social media platforms - specifically, Instagram. In particular, the work examines the role played by consumer-brand involvement and self-brand connection (SBC) as predictors of customer brand engagement (CBE). Design/methodology/approach - In this paper, social commerce-adoption is modeled, using three variables: customer engagement, SBC and fashion-consumer brand-involvement. Using a personal online survey, data on social media users classified as millennials and Generation Z were collected. The model is analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). Findings - Consumer involvement in fashion has a positive effect on cognitive processing and activation, but not on affection. SBC has a positive effect on all three analyzed dimensions. Finally, gender is found to exert a moderating effect on the relationship between the ""CBE activation"" dimension and brand loyalty. Research limitations/implications - The research was conducted during the lockdown imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have influenced the responses. Other limitations and potential lines of research for the future are presented at the end of the paper. Practical implications - Some of the results of this study can directly inform the social media strategies of fashion companies that use Instagram as a channel of communication with their customers. They can also contribute to incentivizing co-created content and increasing consumption among both men and women. Originality/value - The present study contributes to addressing the scarcity of studies dealing with CBE and social commerce in the fashion sector and, in particular, fashion-consumer behavior on social media (specifically, Instagram).","Molina-Prados, A.; Munoz-Leiva, F.; Prados-Pena, M.

The Covid-19 gives an impact on the uncertainty of food commodity prices. As we know, food price stability is one of the supports for maintaining a balance of production and consumer buying power. This study aims to analyze the price volatility of corn, chicken meat, and chicken eggs in Indonesia during the Covid-19 pandemic. The ARCH/GARCH model was used as an approach to analyzing volatility in the monthly prices of corn, chicken meat, and chicken eggs at the consumer level during the January 2011-June 2020 period. This research showed that the price of corn and chicken is categorized as high volatility category, while chicken eggs are a low volatility category with the form is asymmetric. It can be concluded that the price uncertainty faced by consumers in the future for corn and chicken meat will be bigger, while chicken eggs will be decreased. Therefore, it is expected that the government will make policies for maintaining the stability of food supply and prices.","Baladina, Nur Arifin Noor Sugiharto Ratya Anindita Fitrotul Laili",IOP Conference Series.

177183,"'keep calm, stay safe, and drink bubble tea': Commodifying the crisis of covid-19 in singapore advertising",2021,"Background: Overnight monitoring after ablation of atrial fibrillation is the standard protocol. This approach stems from the concern for complications within 24 hours after the procedure. Advances in intra-cardiac echocardiogram, increased resolution of 3D electro-anatomical mapping, force-sensing catheters, and improved vascular access management have allowed for a significant decrease in cardiac perforation or groin hematomas. In addition to increased safety, the concerns related to hospital stays during COVID era signaled the need for same day discharge (SDD) consideration. Objective: Compare the safety outcomes and patient satisfaction on discharges the same day of procedure versus current standard of care. Methods: This study enrolled patients who underwent catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation or left atrial flutter from June 2020 to January 2021 at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center. SDD group was composed of patients who were free from complications for a minimum of 8 hours post procedure and discharged home the same day. The complications monitored during the 8-hours included hypotension with suspected tamponade, stroke, groin hematomas, or any abnormal rhythms noted on predischarge ECG. Standard of care was defined as those patients who remained in the hospital for 24-hours post procedure. Studied outcomes compared the procedure-related complications occurring within versus after the 8-hours post-procedure in the two groups. Additionally, an informal patient satisfaction survey was conducted between the two groups by collecting data from the next day phone follow-up and 1-month clinic visit. Results: A total of 100 patients met inclusion criteria. Fifty-six (56%) patients were in the SDD group, whereas 44 (44%) received standard of care. Same-day discharge and standard of care patients had no significant difference in late procedure-related complications (less than 1% in both groups). Additionally, the SDD group displayed equivalent patient satisfaction as compared to the standard of care patients on follow-up phone call. Conclusion: Compared to the standard of care, same-day discharge provides equivalent patient safety and satisfaction. This has great implications for healthcare economics, especially in COVID-19 era.","Romanowicz, K. C.; Athar, M. W.; Muth, J.; Rajsheker, S.; Joshi, K. R.; Byrd, S.; Groh, J.; Costea, A.

In this report we describe Give Heart Cells a Beat, a permanent interactive science exhibit that allows museum visitors to synchronize the beating of live stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes to their own heart rate in real-time. Evaluation with museum visitors reveals that the exhibit engaged the public with the specimen and prompted curiosity in heart biology and, to a lesser degree, stem cells and electrophysiology. Give Heart Cells a Beat is the product of a close collaboration between a museum and a research laboratory, and, to our knowledge, the first example of the use of live human heart cells in an interactive exhibit.

177562,Smart Healthcare for Diabetes: A COVID-19 Perspective,2020-07-29,"Paramyxoviruses, negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses, pose a potential threat to public health. Currently, 78 species and 17 genera of paramyxoviruses are classified and harbored by multiple natural reservoirs, including rodents, bats, birds, reptiles, and fish. Jeilongvirus has been proposed as a novel paramyxovirus genus containing J-, Beilong, and Tailam viruses, found in wild rodents. Using RT-PCR, 824 Apodemus agrarius individuals were examined for the prevalence of paramyxovirus infections. Paramyxovirus RNA was detected in 108 (13.1%) rodents captured at 14 trapping sites in Korea. We first present two genetically distinct novel paramyxoviruses (genus Jeilongvirus), Paju Apodemus paramyxoviruses 1 (PAPV-1) and 2 (PAPV-2), from A. agrarius. Six PAPV strains were completely sequenced using next-generation and Sanger sequencing. PAPV-1 genome comprised 19,716 nucleotides, with eight genes (3′-N-P/V/C-M-F-SH-TM-G-L-5′), whereas PAPV-2 genome contained 17,475 nucleotides, with seven genes (3′-N-P/V/C-M-F-TM-G-L-5′). The disparity between PAPV-1 and -2 revealed the presence of the SH gene and length of the G gene in the genome organization. The phylogenies of PAPV-1 and -2 belong to distinct genetic lineages of Jeilongvirus despite being from the same natural host. PAPV-1 clustered with Beilong and Tailam viruses, while PAPV-2 formed a genetic lineage with Mount Mabu Lophuromys virus-1. PAPV-1 infected human epithelial and endothelial cells, facilitating the induction of type I/III interferons, interferon-stimulated genes, and proinflammatory cytokines. Therefore, this study provides profound insights into the molecular epidemiology, virus-host interactions, and zoonotic potential of novel rodent-borne paramyxoviruses. Importance Paramyxoviruses are a critical public health and socio-economic burden to humans. Rodents play a crucial role in transmitting pathogens to humans. In the last decade, novel paramyxoviruses have been discovered in different rodents. Here, we found that Apodemus agrarius harbored two distinct genotypes of the novel paramyxoviruses, Paju Apodemus paramyxovirues 1 (PAPV-1) and 2 (PAPV-2), possessing unique genome structures that are responsible for encoding TM and G proteins of different sizes. In addition, PAPV-1 infected human epithelial and endothelial cells, facilitating the induction of type I/III IFNs, ISGs, and proinflammatory cytokines. Thus, this study provides significant insights into molecular prevalence, virus-host interactions of paramyxoviruses. These observations raise the awareness of physicians and scientists about the emergence of new rodent-borne paramyxoviruses.","Lee, Seung-Ho; No, Jin Sun; Kim, Kijin; Budhathoki, Shailesh; Park, Kyungmin; Lee, Geum Young; Cho, Seungchan; Choi, Hyeok Sun; Kim, Bong-Hyun; Cho, Seunghee; Kim, Jong Woo; Lee, Jin Gyeong; Cho, Seung Hye; Kim, Heung-Chul; Klein, Terry A.; Uhm, Chang-Sub; Kim, Won-Keun; Song, Jin-Won",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.03.433816,476

However, the epidemiological relationship between cigarette smoking and SARS-CoV-2 infection is controversial; and the interaction between cigarette smoking, airway expression of the ACE2 receptor and the susceptibility of airway cells to infection is unclear. We exposed differentiated air-liquid interface cultures derived from primary human airway stem cells to cigarette smoke extract (CSE) and infected them with SARS-CoV-2. We found that CSE increased expression of full-length ACE2 (flACE2) but did not alter the expression of a Type I-interferon sensitive truncated ACE2 that lacks the capacity to bind SARS-CoV-2 or a panel of interferon-sensitive genes. Importantly, exposure to CSE did not increase viral infectivity despite the increase in flACE2. Our data are consistent with epidemiological data suggesting current smokers are not at excess risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This does not detract from public health messaging emphasising the excess risk of severe COVID-19 associated with smoking-related cardiopulmonary disease.","Porter, Linsey M; Guo, Wenrui; Crozier, Thomas WM; Greenwood, Edward JD; Ortmann, Brian; Kottmann, Daniel; Nathan, James A; Mahadeva, Ravindra; Lehner, Paul J; McCaughan, Frank",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.08.459428,476
177866,COVID-19 exacerbates unequal food access,2021,"The second and third waves of COVID-19 pandemic have largely been driven by the surge of successive SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC). These VOC have rapidly spread through multiple geographies being enabled by high transmission rates and/or high viral load compared to the original parent strain. Consequently, the altered phenotypes of these VOC have posed greater challenges to diagnostic and clinical management of COVID-19. Despite considerable progress being made on vaccine roll out, practicing proper hand hygiene has been advocated as a consistent precautionary intervention as more virulent VOC continue to emerge and spread across geographies. Two variants of concern, namely beta and delta, have recently been shown to escape antibody-mediated neutralization by virtue of acquired mutations in the receptor-binding domain of the viral spike protein which binds to the human ACE2 receptor for cellular entry. In this report we have empirically determined the efficacy of a range of personal care formulations in inactivating the beta and delta variants of SARS-CoV-2. High titres of these variants were exposed to marketed personal care formulations from Unilever under standard in-vitro suspension test-based conditions relevant to end-user habits. All the formulations demonstrated greater than 99.9% reduction in viral infective titres. The rate of inactivation by these products were comparable to that of the original strain of SARS-CoV-2 virus tested under the same conditions. Therefore, it can be concluded that well-designed personal care formulations when tested under consumer-centric conditions, and with proven efficacy against the parent strain of SARS-CoV-2 will continue to be effective against extant and emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2. This is through their broad-spectrum mode of action (disruption of lipid bilayer of the host-derived viral envelope, denaturation of envelop and nucleocapsid proteins, and disruption of genome) which is independent of the escape mutations that facilitate immune evasion or enhanced transmissibility.","Mukherjee, Sayandip; Vincent, Carol K.; Jayasekera, Harshinie W.; Yekhe, Ashish Shrikant",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.20.461073,476

While previous research has shed light on the impact of destination different restaurant service quality attributes on tourists’ satisfaction, there is a lack of research identifying the dimensions of food safety indicators driving tourist’s restaurant selection and satisfaction solely. This study aims to fill the gaps by developing a scale measuring 433 international tourists’ perceptions about hygiene standards in Phuket small restaurants. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed a four-factor model that influences tourists’ restaurant selection. These factors were: waitstaff’s appearance and personal hygiene, cleanliness of restaurant, toilet hygiene, and food safety information cues. Cleanliness of restaurant and waitstaff’s appearances and personal hygiene were two key factors influencing tourist satisfaction of small restaurants. The significance of restaurant hygiene quality has received less attention in tourism marketing literature, thus this study adds further importance by underlining its implication to the sustainable management of destination restaurants. However, this study suffered from several limitations, for instance, the study’s framework, the inability to generalize the results due to the research scope and context, and the concurrence of data collection with the COVID-19 pandemic which pave the way for future studies.

Spatio-temporal analysis by state were performed, mainly from April to September 2020, including descriptive analyses through mapping and time series representations, and the fit of linear mixed models and time series clustering to analyze trends by state. The association of comorbidities and other variables with the risks were studied by fitting a spatial panel data linear model (splm). As results, we observed that on average the greatest risks were reached by July, and that highest risks were observed in some states, Baja California Norte, Chiapas, and Sonora; interestingly, some densely populated states, as Mexico City, had lower values. Different trends by state were observed, and a four-order polynomial, including fixed and random effects, was necessary to model them. The most general structure is one in which the risks increase and then decrease and was observed in states belonging to two clusters; however, there is a cluster corresponding to states with a retarded increase, and another in which increasing risks through time were observed. A cyclic behavior in terms of states having a second increasing trend was observed. Finally, according to the splm, percentage of men, being in the group of 50 years and over, chronic kidney disease failure, cardiovascular disease, asthma, and hypertension were positively associated with the case-fatality risks. This analysis may provide valuable insight into COVID-19 dynamics in future outbreaks, as well as the determinants of these trends at a state level; and, by combining spatial and temporal information, provide a better understanding of COVID-19 case-fatality.","Ramampiacuterez-Aldana, R.; Naranjo, L.; Gomez-Verjan, J.

179187,A humángenetikai eltérések lehetséges szerepe Covid-19-fertőzésben,2021,"New Zealand’s Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) developed a risk analysis for Hector’s and Maui dolphins, in order to inform protection options being considered by the Ministers of Fisheries and Conservation. Unfortunately, MPI’s risk analysis combines several estimates that are biased, and the biases consistently act together to underestimate the level of bycatch and overestimate the species’ ability to sustain impacts. In essence, the approach uses abundance estimates that are likely biased high, multiplies them by a reproductive rate that has been arbitrarily raised, multiplied by an assumed figure for calf survival, to reach a number of dolphins that would be added each year if the population were to remain stable. From this number, they subtract their estimates of bycatch, which are almost certainly biased low. The remaining number of dolphins is apportioned a cause of death according to autopsy data from 55 Hector’s and Maui dolphins found dead on beaches. This is then compared to estimates of what level of takes would be sustainable, calculated using a formula that is not well understood and less conservative than the international standard (PBR, developed by the US National Marine Fisheries Service). This is a poor basis for rational management of an endangered, endemic marine mammal. A key problem with the MPI approach is that its definition of “risk” does not relate to the risk of population decline or extinction, and is inconsistent with the modern understanding of the behaviour of meta-populations. The approach defines risk as the likelihood of capture, which is apportioned to different areas according to fishing effort and the habitat model’s outputs for dolphin distribution. The protection options are therefore targeted where high densities of dolphins and high fishing effort coincide. Large populations are allocated the highest level of protection, while small populations remain poorly protected. This approach is likely to increase the risk of local extinctions, contractions of dolphin distribution, population fragmentation, loss of genetic variability and result in increased risk to the species as a whole. Many of these points were made by an International Expert Panel in 2018. MPI have failed to provide a list of recommendations from the Expert Panel Report with their responses (if any) to those recommendations. This standard step in scientific practice, following peer review (e.g. response to reviewers’ comments) has not been followed.","Slooten, Elisabeth; Dawson, Stephen Michael",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.15.098889,476
179228,Sites of silence: Deaf online communication in the time of corona,2021,"Context. Bulge globular clusters (BGCs) are exceptional tracers of the formation and chemodynamical evolution of this oldest Galactic component. However, until now, observational difficulties have prevented us from taking full advantage of these powerful Galactic archeological tools. Aims. CAPOS, the bulge Cluster APOgee Survey, addresses this key topic by observing a large number of BGCs, most of which have only been poorly studied previously. Even their most basic parameters, such as metallicity, [{\alpha}/Fe], and radial velocity, are generally very uncertain. We aim to obtain accurate mean values for these parameters, as well as abundances for a number of other elements, and explore multiple populations. In this first paper, we describe the CAPOS project and present initial results for seven BGCs. Methods. CAPOS uses the APOGEE-2S spectrograph observing in the H band to penetrate obscuring dust toward the bulge. For this initial paper, we use abundances derived from ASPCAP, the APOGEE pipeline. Results. We derive mean [Fe/H] values of $-$0.85$\pm$0.04 (Terzan 2), $-$1.40$\pm$0.05 (Terzan 4), $-$1.20$\pm$0.10 (HP 1), $-$1.40$\pm$0.07 (Terzan 9), $-$1.07$\pm$0.09 (Djorg 2), $-$1.06$\pm$0.06 (NGC 6540), and $-$1.11$\pm$0.04 (NGC 6642) from three to ten stars per cluster. We determine mean abundances for eleven other elements plus the mean [$\alpha$/Fe] and radial velocity. CAPOS clusters significantly increase the sample of well-studied Main Bulge globular clusters (GCs) and also extend them to lower metallicity. We reinforce the finding that Main Bulge and Main Disk GCs, formed in situ, have [Si/Fe] abundances slightly higher than their accreted counterparts at the same metallicity. We investigate multiple populations and find our clusters generally follow the light-element (anti)correlation trends of previous studies of GCs of similar metallicity. We finally explore the abundances ...","Geisler, Doug; Villanova, Sandro; O'Connell, Julia E.; Cohen, Roger E.; Bidin, Christian Moni; Fern'andez-Trincado, Jos'e G.; Munoz, Cesar; Minniti, Dante; Zoccali, Manuela; Rojas-Arriagada, Alvaro; Ramos, Rodrigo Contreras; Catelan, M'arcio; Mauro, Francesco; Cort'es, Crist'ian; Lopes, C.

The effective implementation of social distancing practices requires sufficient levels of visual acuity. However, persons suffering from full or partial blindness may be more vulnerable to such diseases, due to their sensory limitations affecting their ability to socially distance themselves. Moreover, these limitations make it difficult to identify and remember others who have violated social distance. In order to mitigate these issues, we present a novel hybrid sensory and affectory modality that we call 'Phosphenotype'. Phosphenotype detects approaching persons using sonar proximity sensors and accordingly alerts its user using non-invasive electrically-stimulated phosphenes, thus aiding a partially sighted user to more effectively practice social-distancing. © 2020 IEEE.","Sadrzadeh-Afsharazar, F.; Mann, S.; Douplik, A.","4th International Conference on Multimedia Computing, Networking and Applications, MCNA 2020",https://doi.org/10.1109/mcna50957.2020.9264302,476

Trying to find best approach from pathophysiology to treatment.,2021-07-07,"Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Dique Filipeia rehabilitation protocol in patients with COVID-19 admitted to reference hospitals. Methods: This is an experimental study with COVID-19 patients admitted to the hospitals wards being considered eligible. The study outcomes were assessed between patients undergoing the rehabilitation protocol (Dique Filipeia group) and patients who did not receive the protocol (control group). The rehabilitation protocol consisted in classifying patients daily into four levels of severity through peripheral oxygen saturation. Severity was classified by the oxygen flow needed to maintain a saturation greater than or equal to the cut-off point of 93%. A standardized ventilatory support and functional rehabilitation exercises were performed for each severity level patient, followed by an attempt to wean oxygen. Results: A total of 727 patients were analyzed in the study. The Dique Filipeia group presented a lower total (132.7 vs 307.0 m3/patient; effect size 1.73) and daily (2.9 vs 6.8 m3/day/patient; effect size 1.46) oxygen expenditure than the control group. The Dique Filipeia patients presented higher hospital discharge (64.9 vs 35.4%; effect size 3.46) and lower length of stay (15.8 vs 29.1 days; effect size 3.47) than the control group. The Dique Filipeia group patients, who were demanding oxygen therapy, were using 6.2 L/min of oxygen at day 1. There was a statistically significant reduction from day 2 (p = 0.0001) and oxygen flow was reduced below 1L/min after day 7. Conclusions: The implementation of a standardized rehabilitation protocol reduced oxygen expenditure, increased hospital discharge and reduced the length of hospital stay. Dique Filipeia is a practical, feasible and safe protocol.","Frazao, M.; Paiva, K. M.; S, R. M. d. N.; Menezes, F. d. S.; Alves, L. A. d. S.; Souza Rocha, A. I. S. d.; Franca, E. E. T.; Santos, A. d.

The Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) method is used to simulate the transmission process, and the Latin Hypercube Sampling is applied for parameter estimation in ABM. The simulation results show that most of the infected cases on the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship were transmitted between passengers. However, at the beginning of the quarantine, most infected passengers were infected by crew members rather than other passengers. Due to the nature of their work, the crew members played a key role in the early spread of the epidemic on the cruise ship. If the lab testing was strengthened for crew members at the beginning of the quarantine, and the infected crew members were disembarked on time, the final total number of infected would be greatly reduced. Furthermore, if this measure is supplemented with other measures such as increasing the frequency of washing hand by crew members, strengthening hygiene for the process of distributing foods, strengthening deck surface cleaning which can reduce the probabilities of transmission from a crew member to a passenger and between passengers while on deck, the final number of infected would be further highly reduced. © 2021 IEEE.","Xi, Z.; Meng, D.; Zhao, J.","10th IEEE Data Driven Control and Learning Systems Conference, DDCLS 2021",https://doi.org/10.1109/ddcls52934.2021.9455449,476

The paper exploits the growing availability of open access databases, such as the Lens and Microsoft Academic Graph, along with taxonomic data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) to explore the scientific and patent literature for the Antarctic at scale. The paper identifies the main contours of scientific research in Antarctica before exploring commercially oriented biodiversity research and development in the scientific literature and patent publications. The paper argues that biodiversity is not a free good and must be paid for. Ways forward in debates on commercial research and development in Antarctica can be found through increasing attention to the valuation of ecosystem services, new approaches to natural capital accounting and payment for ecosystem services that would bring the Antarctic, and the Antarctic Treaty System, into the wider fold of work on the economics of biodiversity. Economics based approaches can be criticised for reducing biodiversity to monetary exchange values at the expense of recognition of the wider values of biodiversity and its services. However, approaches grounded in the economics of biodiversity provide a transparent framework for approaching commercial activity in the Antarctic and introducing requirements for investments in the conservation of Antarctic biodiversity by those who seek to profit from it.","Oldham, Paul; Kindness, Jasmine",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.03.074849,476

On March 11, 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. As no specific approved treatment options are available for the COVID-19 infection, several existing antiviral drugs in combination with others have become the mainstay therapy. The targets for the treatment of the infection include viral targets such as polymerases, spike glycoproteins, membrane proteins, and viral envelope and host targets such as host proteases and host receptors. Antiviral agents, immunomodulatory agents, and empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics can be used as treatment therapies for the infection. Convalescent plasma therapy has also been proposed as an effective treatment for COVID-19.

Pokrajac,2021,"In the spring and early summer of 2020, many agricultural production facilities were forced to reduce processing rates of agricultural commodities. Milk production plants were unable to quickly change milk packaging from ½ pint milk cartons destined for school lunches to larger containers for grocery stores as the nation's schools switched to virtual learning. Bulk commodities destined for restaurants needed to be repackaged as restaurants were closed due to the pandemic. Meat processing plants had to reduce production rates as COVID-19 outbreaks among their employees slowed production lines and increased the required time for sanitation of facilities to take place. These processing reductions led to commodity stockpiles in excess of what could be processed before spoilage. Milk needed to be land spread as a waste product, swine and poultry needed to be depopulated and disposed of since continued feeding was not feasible, and other specialty crops needed to be disposed of when storage capacity limits were reached.

181224,NO INCREASE IN RELATIVE MORTALITY RATES FOR THOSE WITHOUT A COLLEGE DEGREE DURING COVID-19: AN ANOMALY,2021-07-23,"Background. Point-of-care (POC) lung ultrasound (LUS) is widely used in the emergency setting and there is an established evidence base across a range of respiratory diseases, including previous viral epidemics. The necessity for rapid testing combined with the limitations of other diagnostic tests has led to the proposal of various potential roles for LUS during the COVID-19 pandemic. This systematic review and meta-analysis focused specifically on the diagnostic accuracy of LUS in adult patients presenting with suspected COVID-19. Methods. Traditional and grey-literature searches were performed on June 1st 2021. Two authors independently carried out the searches, selected studies and completed the Quality Assessment Tool for Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2). Meta-analysis was carried out using established open-source packages in R. We report overall sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curve for LUS. Heterogeneity was determined using the I2 statistic. Results. Twenty studies were included, providing data from a total of 4,314 patients. The prevalence and admission rates were generally high across all studies. Overall LUS was found to be 87.2% sensitive (95% CI 83.6-90.2) and 69.5% specific (95% CI 62.2-72.5) and demonstrated overall positive and negative predictive values of 3.0 (95% 2.3-4.1) and 0.16 (95% 0.12-0.22) respectively. Separate analyses for each reference standard revealed similar sensitivities and specificities for LUS. Heterogeneity between studies was found to be high, and QUADAS-2 assessment identified risks of bias in many studies. Conclusion. During a period of high prevalence, LUS is a highly sensitive diagnostic test for COVID-19. However, more research is required to confirm these results in more generalisable populations, including those less likely to be admitted to hospital.","Matthies, A.; Trauer, M.; Chopra, K.; Jarman, R.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.10.09.21264799v1?rss=1,476

However, it is challenging to reliably deploy this technique in healthcare settings due to a lack of smart technologies capable of ensuring proper decontamination conditions of hundreds of masks simultaneously. To tackle these challenges, we developed an open-source wireless sensor platform-VeriMask1-that facilitates per-mask verification of the moist-heat decontamination process. VeriMask is capable of monitoring hundreds of masks simultaneously in commercially available heating systems and provides a novel throughput-maximization functionality to help operators optimize the decontamination settings. We evaluate VeriMask in laboratory and real-scenario clinical settings and find that it effectively detects decontamination failures and operator errors in multiple settings and increases the mask decontamination throughput. Our easy-to-use, low-power, low-cost, scalable platform integrates with existing hospital protocols and equipment, and can be broadly deployed in under-resourced facilities to protect front-line healthcare workers by lowering their risk of infection from reused N95 masks. We also memorialize the design challenges, guidelines, and lessons learned from developing and deploying VeriMask during the COVID-19 Pandemic.

Cancer patients have mainly accessed these services, but there is growing consensus about the importance of promoting access for patients with non-malignant disease. Bad survival prognosis and patient's frailty are usual dimensions to decide PC inclusion. Objectives: The main aim of this work is to design and evaluate three quantitative models based on machine learning approaches to predict frailty and mortality on older patients in the context of supporting palliative care decision making: one-year mortality, survival regression and one-year frailty classification. Methods: The dataset used in this study is composed of 39,310 hospital admissions for 19,753 older patients (age >= 65) from January 1st, 2011 to December 30th, 2018. All prediction models were based on Gradient Boosting Machines. From the initial pool of variables at hospital admission, 20 were selected by a recursive feature elimination algorithm based on the random forest's GINI importance criterion. Besides, we run an independent grid search to find the best hyperparameters in each model. The evaluation was performed by 10-fold cross-validation and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC ROC) and mean absolute error (MAE) were reported. The Cox proportional-hazards model was used to compare our proposed approach with classical survival methods. Results: The one-year mortality model achieved an AUC ROC of 0.87 +- 0.01; the mortality regression model achieved an MAE of 329.97 +- 5.24 days. The one-year frailty classification reported an AUC ROC of 0.9 +- 0.01. The Spearman's correlation between the admission frailty index and the survival time was -0.1, while the point-biserial correlation between one-year frailty index and survival time was -0.16. Conclusions: One-year mortality model performance is at a state-of-the-art level. Frailty Index used in this study behaves coherently with other works in the literature. One-year frailty classifier demonstrated that frailty status within the year could be predicted accurately. To our knowledge, this is the first study predicting on-year frailty status based on a frailty index.

We combined the new model with a Gompertz-growth model, a generalized logistic model, and a susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) model; and fitted them via Bayesian methods to data from Cuba and Spain. The combined-model fits yielded better Bayesian-Information-Criterion values than the Gompertz, logistic, and SIR models alone.

In this review, the current evidence related to the ocular transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and its common manifestations was studied. According to this review, 7% to 69.4% of patients had at least an ocular symptom following COVID-19. Ocular symptom are bilateral or unilateral conjunctivitis, increased secretion, eye itching and foreign body sensation, epiphora, dry eye, conjunctival congestion, eye pink, conjunctival hyperemia, and chemosis. SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in tears and conjunctiva. Therefore, the transmission of COVID-19 by conjunctiva is possible. Then, it is essential to wear eye shield to protect against developing ocular involvement by COVID-19 because personal glasses and contact lenses cannot protect from COVID-19.","Mirshamsi, M.; Ghiasi, N.; Heidari, S.; Hosseinpour, P.; Hassanlouei, B.; Hashemipour, S.

182681,Response to governmental COVID-19 restrictions: the role of informal institutions,2021,"Importance: At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was limited understanding of symptom experience and disease progression. Objective: We developed and validated a fit-for-purpose, disease-specific instrument to assess symptoms in patients with COVID-19 to inform endpoints in an interventional trial for non-hospitalized patients. Design: The initial drafting of the 23-item Symptoms Evolution of COVID-19 (SE-C19) Instrument was developed based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention symptom list and available published literature specific to patients with COVID-19 as of Spring 2020. The measurement principles in the Food and Drug Administration patient-reported outcomes guidance and the four methodological Patient-Focused Drug Development Guidances were also considered. Setting: Interviews were conducted virtually with patients recruited through a healthcare research firm. Participants: Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of 30 non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19 Intervention: Interviews involved two stages: (1) concept elicitation, to obtain information about the symptoms experienced as a result of COVID-19 in patients' own words, and (2) cognitive debriefing, for patients to describe their understanding of the SE-C19 instructions, specific symptoms, response options, and recall period to ensure the content of the SE-C19 is relevant and comprehensive. Five clinicians treating COVID-19 outpatients were interviewed to obtain their insights on symptoms experienced by patients and provide input on the SE-C19. Main Outcome and Measure: Patients reported no issues regarding the relevance or appropriateness of the SE-C19 instructions, including the recall period. The comprehensiveness of the SE-C19 was confirmed against the conceptual model developed in the qualitative research. Minor conceptual gaps were revealed to capture nuances in the experience of nasal and gustatory symptoms, and systemic manifestations of sickness. Almost all items were endorsed by patients as being appropriate and well understood. The clinicians largely approved all items, response options, and recall period. Conclusions and Relevance: The qualitative research provided supportive evidence of the content validity of the SE-C19 instrument to assess the symptoms of outpatients with COVID-19 and its use in clinical trials to evaluate the benefit of treatment. Minor changes may be considered to improve conceptual clarity and ease of responding.

Although body size has profound effects on the behavior, physiology, ecology, and evolution of animals, how investment in immune defenses changes with body size is unknown. Here, we develop a novel 12-point dilution-curve approach to describe and compare antibacterial capacity against 3 bacterial species among >160 terrestrial species of mammals. We show that antibacterial activity in serum across mammals exhibits isometry, but the serum of large mammals is less hospitable to bacteria than would be predicted by their metabolic rates. Specifically, hypometric metabolic rates would predict that a large species should have disproportionately lower antibacterial capacity than small species, but body size is unrelated to killing capacity across species. Scaling of antibacterial immune defenses provides novel perspectives on the ecology of host-pathogen interactions, and on their co-evolutionary dynamics. These results have direct implications for effectively modeling the evolution of immune defenses and identifying potential reservoir hosts of zoonotic pathogens.","Downs, Cynthia J.; Schoenle, Laura A.; Goolsby, Eric W.; Oakey, Samantha J.; Ball, Ray; Jiang, Rays H.Y.; Klasing, Kirk C.; Martin, Lynn B.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.04.242107,476

WHO declared COVID-19 as a public health emergency and classified it as a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic affected the medical education globally. Aim of the Study: The aim of the study is to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on the internship program. Materials and Methods: A cross sectional study was conducted among the medical and dental students of various universities in Makkah region of Saudi Arabia. A questionnaire consisting of 15 close ended, pre-tested questions was developed to determine the experiences and perceptions of medical and dental interns due to COVID-19. The data were tabulated and analyzed using SPSS version 21. Chi-square test was used to assess the experiences and perceptions among the Medical and Dental interns. P-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The study included 453 participants, out of which 253 were dental interns and 200 were medical interns. 231 (51%) of male interns participated in this study and 222 (49%) female interns participated. 140 (55.6%) and 138 (69.3%) of the participants of the dental and medical interns respectively felt COVID-19 affected options to select specialties of their interest for post-graduation, whereas, 112 (44.4%) and 61 (30.7%) of the dental and medical interns felt other way. Conclusion: Majority of the participants reported that COVID-19 did not affect them psychologically. In addition, most of the medical and dental interns felt covid-19 affected opinions to select specialties of their interest for post-graduation.","Shetty, K.; Wali, O.; Maleh, A. T. M.; Alharthi, Z.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the extent to which the principals' personal characteristics (gender, age, ICT competencies, self-efficacy, work efficiency, support for teacher autonomy, positive and negative affect) together with some contextual characteristics (school size) contribute to the principals' burnout, that is, to emotional exhaustion as a key dimension of burnout. The sample consisted of 206 principals (of which 74 (35.9%) were men) who completed an online questionnaire during the implementation of online education due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The results showed that for the emotional exhaustion of principals, in the situations of online education due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the most important predictors were their ICT skills and the negative affect that they experience at work. Additionally, negative affect completely mediated the relationship between the principals' self-efficacy and their emotional exhaustion at work.","Soric, I.; Buric, I.; Penezic, Z.",Drustvena Istrazivanja,https://doi.org/10.5559/di.30.2.02,476

The initial wave of coronarivus infections saw a predominantly consultant-delivered service, limited antenatal education and restrictions on hospital visitors. We assessed the impact of the pandemic on adherence to EROSS bundles and hospital discharge. Methods: Caldicott Guardian approval was obtained to review data regarding planned CD across three maternity units in our health board over two time periods: 18 March – 14 July 2019 (“baseline”) and 16 March – 12 July 2020 (“COVID”). Data were extracted from electronic patient records (Badgernet) and cross-referenced with theatre data (Opera). Patient characteristics, EROSS bundle adherence and postoperative length of stay (LoS) were compared. Results: A total of 1306 planned CD were reviewed. Patient characteristics were similar. Bundle adherence, where recorded, was variable. LoS was recorded in all cases – median LoS was reduced in the COVID cohort, and day 1 discharge rates increased significantly. [Formula presented] Discussion: Despite challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic, a planned CD service was successfully maintained in our region. Continuing the trend established over the preceding 4 years, median LOS was reduced. Day 1 discharges were significantly increased despite variable bundle compliance. Are these changes a natural continuation of the embedded EROSS pathway, or have perceived barriers to discharge (eg staff shortages, limited antenatal education, non-compliance with care bundles) been superseded by concerns around exposure to coronavirus while in hospital? Further qualitative research with staff and patient surveys may provide greater insight.","Brown, N.; McCallum, A.

However, the sanitary crisis has induced a multiple faceted crisis, with a number of implications whose consequences are to impact on the further development of the human society as a whole. Treated at first with a certain degree of relaxation, considering the stage we were facing at the time, when both the scientific community and the decision-making actors of the responsible organizations in the field were focusing on the management of the situation, unprecedented at such a scale, on identifying the protocols and action strategies, respectively on implementing recommendations for governments, companies and population, the crisis after the crisis would really capture the researchers attention in the second part of the last year.

Purified, soluble MHVR expressed from a recombinant vaccinia virus neutralized the infectivity of the A59 strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-A59) in a concentration-dependent manner. Several anchored murine Bgps in addition to MHVR can also function as MHV-A59 receptors when expressed at high levels in nonmurine cells. To investigate the interactions of these alternative MHVR glycoproteins with MHV, we expressed and purified to apparent homogeneity the extracellular domains of several murine Bgps as soluble, six-histidine-tagged glycoproteins, using a baculovirus expression system. These include MHVR isoforms containing four or two extracellular domains and the corresponding Bgp1(b) glycoproteins from MHV-resistant SJL/J mice, as well as Bgp2 and truncation mutants of MHVR and Bgp1(b) comprised of the first two immunoglobulin-like domains. The soluble four-domain MHVR glycoprotein (sMHVR[1-4]) had fourfold more MHV-A59 neutralizing activity than the corresponding soluble Bgp1(b) (sBgp1(b)) glycoprotein and at least 1,000-fold more neutralizing activity than sBgp2. Although virus binds to the N-terminal domain (domain 1), soluble truncation mutants of MHVR and Bgp1(b) containing only domains 1 and 2 bound virus poorly and had 10- and 300-fold less MHV-A59 neutralizing activity than the corresponding four-domain glycoproteins. In contrast, the soluble MHVR glycoprotein containing domains 1 and 4 (sMHVR[1,4]) had as much neutralizing activity as the four-domain glycoprotein, sMHVR[1-4]. Thus, the virus neutralizing activity of MHVR domain 1 appears to be enhanced by domain 4. The sBgp1(b)[1-4] glycoprotein had 500-fold less neutralizing activity for MHV-JHM than for MHV-A59. Thus, MHV strains with differences in S-glycoprotein sequence, tissue tropism, and virulence can differ in the ability to utilize the various murine Bgps as receptors.","Zelus, B D; Wessner, D R; Williams, R K; Pensiero, M N; Phibbs, F T; deSouza, M; Dveksler, G S; Holmes, K V",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9696818/,476

D. Nagy and J. J. Bujarski. J. Virol. 70:415-426, 1996). To test whether AU-rich sequences can facilitate homologous recombination, AU-rich sequences were introduced into parental BMV RNAs (RNA2 and RNA3). These insertions created a homologous RNA2-RNA3 recombination hotspot. Two other AU-rich sequences also supported high-frequency homologous recombination if a common sequence with high or average G/C content was present immediately upstream of the AU-rich element. Homologous RNA recombination did not require any additional sequence motifs or RNA structures and was position nonspecific within the 3' noncoding region. These results suggest that nucleotide content (i.e., the presence of common 5' GC-rich or moderately AU-rich and 3' AU-rich regions) is the important factor that determines the sites of homologous recombination. A mechanism that involves replicase switching during synthesis of positive-sense RNA strands is presented to explain the observed results.","Nagy, P D; Bujarski, J J",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9094655/,476

193915,Equitable COVID-19 Vaccine Access.,2021-06-01,": BACKGROUND: The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between dexamethasone suppression test, personality disorder, stressful life events and depression. MATERIAL: Fifty patients (15 males and 35 females) aged 41.0 +/- 11.4 years, suffering from Major Depression according to DSM-IV criteria entered the study. METHOD: Diagnosis was obtained with the aid of the SCAN v 2.0 and the IPDE. Psychometric assessment included the HDRS, HAS, the Newcastle Scale (version 1965 and 1971), the Diagnostic Melancholia Scale, the Personality Deviance Scale and the GAF scale. The 1 mg DST was used. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Included MANOVA, ANOVA with LSD post hoc test and chi-square test. RESULTS: Sixteen (32%) patients were non-suppressors. Eight patients without Personality Disorder (PD) (23.5%), and 5 of those with PD of cluster B (50%) were non-suppressors. Atypical patients were the subtype with the highest rate of non-suppression (42.85%). No difference between suppressors and non-suppressors was detected in any of the scales. DISCUSSION: The results of the current study suggest that pathological DST is not a core feature of major depression. They also suggest that there are more than one subtypes of depression, concerning the response to stress. It seems that the majority of depressed patients (50%) does not experience high levels of stress either in terms of self reported experience or neuroendocrine function. The rest of patients however, either experience high levels of stress, or manifest its somatic analogue (DST non-suppression) or have a very low threshold of stress tolerance, which makes them to behave in a hostile way.","Fountoulakis, Kn; Iacovides, A; Fotiou, F; Karamouzis, M; Demetriadou, A; Kaprinis, G",Annals of general hospital psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15598349/,476

We aim to explore the corrected QT (QTc) interval and 'torsadogenic' potential of hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir-ritonavir utilising a combination of smartphone electrocardiogram and 12-lead electrocardiogram monitoring. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between 16-April-2020 to 30-April- 2020, patients with suspected or confirmed for COVID-19 indicated for in-patient treatment with hydroxychloroquine with or without lopinavir-ritonavir to the Sarawak General Hospital were monitored with KardiaMobile smartphone electrocardiogram (AliveCor®, Mountain View, CA) or standard 12-lead electrocardiogram. The baseline and serial QTc intervals were monitored till the last dose of medications or until the normalization of the QTc interval. RESULTS Thirty patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine, and 20 (66.7%) patients received a combination of hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir-ritonavir therapy. The maximum QTc interval was significantly prolonged compared to baseline (434.6±28.2msec vs. 458.6±47.1msec, p=0.001). The maximum QTc interval (456.1±45.7msec vs. 464.6±45.2msec, p=0.635) and the delta QTc (32.6±38.5msec vs. 26.3±35.8msec, p=0.658) were not significantly different between patients on hydroxychloroquine or a combination of hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir-ritonavir. Five (16.7%) patients had QTc of 500msec or more. Four (13.3%) patients required discontinuation of hydroxychloroquine and 3 (10.0%) patients required discontinuation of lopinavirritonavir due to QTc prolongation. However, no torsade de pointes was observed. CONCLUSIONS QTc monitoring using smartphone electrocardiogram was feasible in COVID-19 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine with or without lopinavir-ritonavir. The usage of hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir-ritonavir resulted in QTc prolongation, but no torsade de pointes or arrhythmogenic death was observed.","Andy Ko, T Y; Chen, L S; Pang, I X; Ling, H S; Wong, T C; Sia Tonnii, L L; Koh, K T",The Medical journal of Malaysia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33742617/,476
196723,Reflections on COVID-19.,2020,"Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is caused by one of several strains of feline coronaviruses which are grouped into 2 general types of viruses. Infection of cats with FIP virus results in production of serum antibodies which may be protective in conjunction with cell mediated immunity, may provided no protection at all, or may produce an immune enhancement to subsequent exposure to another FIP virus or a recrudescence of the original infecting virus. Attempts at immunization of cats against FIP with inactivated or live FIP viruses have been generally unsuccessful, and often sensitizing the cat through immune enhancement rather than providing protection. Heterologous live virus vaccines using viruses of the same antigenic cluster (transmissible gastroenteritis of swine, canine coronavirus, and human coronavirus 229E) have failed to provide protection against FIP virus. Further research into the exact mechanism of protection and immune enhancement is needed in order to understand ways of producing an effective and safe vaccine.","Scott, F W",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2829570/,476
197155,Emergency Medicine Medical Director's Perspective: Preparation and Response to a Pandemic.,2021,"Thus far, systems developed for heterologous gene expression from the genomes of nidoviruses (arteriviruses and coronaviruses) have relied mainly on the translation of foreign genes from subgenomic mRNAs, whose synthesis is a key feature of the nidovirus life cycle. In general, such expression vectors often suffered from relatively low and unpredictable expression levels, as well as genome instability. In an attempt to circumvent these disadvantages, the possibility to express a foreign gene [encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP)] from within the nidovirus replicase gene, which encodes two large polyproteins that are processed proteolytically into the non-structural proteins (nsps) required for viral RNA synthesis, has now been explored. A viable recombinant of the arterivirus Equine arteritis virus, EAV-GFP2, was obtained, which contained the eGFP insert at the site specifying the junction between the two most N-proximal replicase-cleavage products, nsp1 and nsp2. EAV-GFP2 replication could be launched by transfection of cells with either in vitro-generated RNA transcripts or a DNA launch plasmid. EAV-GFP2 displayed growth characteristics similar to those of the wild-type virus and was found to maintain the insert stably for at least eight passages. It is proposed that EAV-GFP2 has potential for arterivirus vector development and as a tool in inhibitor screening. It can also be used for fundamental studies into EAV replication, which was illustrated by the fact that the eGFP signal of EAV-GFP2, which largely originated from an eGFP-nsp2 fusion protein, could be used to monitor the formation of the membrane-bound EAV replication complex in real time.","van den Born, Erwin; Posthuma, Clara C; Knoops, Kèvin; Snijder, Eric J",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17374763/,476
197213,A Comprehensive Overview of the US Army Dentistry Response to COVID-19.,2021,"The present paper is based on an address given at the Australian Financial Review Health Congress in February, 2005. Let's start with the underlying premise that patients have a valid right to fair and just access to emergency care. Fairness and justice are concepts more comfortably placed within legal and sociological settings than within health. They refer to our ability to deliver care without bias or favour. Our college has published a statement asserting patients' right to appropriate access (Patients' Right to Access Emergency Department Care. ACEM Policy Statement P31, March 2004). The other underlying premise in this discussion is that this issue of equity of access actually matters. It may be of significance at a moral level, at a relative resource consumption level, at the level of occupation of system capacity, or at the level of clinical outcomes for individual patients.","Kennedy, Marcus",Emergency medicine Australasia : EMA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16091104/,476

AIM To evaluate the preventive measures taken by the service sector companies against the spread of the virus. METHODS A survey of 115 service sector companies was carried out in the prefecture of Setif (Algeria). The data was collected using a pre-established questionnaire completed with one of the officials of the company and by direct observation. RESULTS A high prevalence (42%) of women put on leave was found. Physical meetings were held in 38% of the companies, hydroalcoholic solution was available for employees in 85% and for customers only in 4%. In more than 70% of cases, disinfection of surfaces, floors and door handles took place frequently. Safety distance between employees and customers was respected in 88%, between employees in 66% and between customers in 63% of the companies. The wearing of a mask by all, the majority, some and none of the employees was observed in respectively 15%, 17%, 39% and 29% of the companies. CONCLUSION The preventive measures against the risk of contamination by Covid-19 infection taken in the visited companies were considered insufficient. An awareness campaign has been initiated to correct the shortcomings observed.","Hamadouche, Mohamed; Allouche, Sabrina",La Tunisie medicale,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33480017/,476

200226,"Serosurveillance and the COVID-19 Epidemic in the US: Undetected, Uncertain, and Out of Control",2020,"Errors that alter the reading frame occur extremely rarely during translation, yet some genes have evolved sequences that efficiently induce frameshifting. These sequences, termed programmed frameshift sites, manipulate the translational apparatus to promote non-canonical decoding. Frameshifts are mechanistically diverse. Most cause a -1 shift of frames; the first such site was discovered in a metazoan retrovirus, but they are now known to be dispersed quite widely among evolutionarily diverse species. +1 frameshift sites are much less common, but again dispersed widely. The rarest form are the translational hop sites which program the ribosome to bypass a region of several dozen nucleotides. Each of these types of events are stimulated by distinct mechanisms. All of the events share a common phenomenology in which the programmed frameshift site causes the ribosome to pause during elongation so that the kinetically unfavorable alternative decoding event can occur. During this pause most frameshifts occur because one or more ribosome-bound tRNAs slip between cognate or near-cognate codons. However, even this generalization is not entirely consistent, since some frameshifts occur without slippage. Because of their similarity to rarer translational errors, programmed frameshift sites provide a tool with which to probe the mechanism of frame maintenance.","Farabaugh, P J",Annual review of genetics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8982463/,476

Here, we demonstrate that nucleolar localization of a key herpesvirus regulatory protein is essential for its role in virus mRNA nuclear export. The herpesvirus saimiri ORF57 protein is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttle protein that is conserved in all herpesviruses and orchestrates the nuclear export of viral intronless mRNAs. We demonstrate that expression of the ORF57 protein induces nucleolar redistribution of human TREX (transcription/export) proteins that are involved in mRNA nuclear export. Moreover, we describe a previously unidentified nucleolar localization signal within ORF57 that is composed of two distinct nuclear localization signals. Intriguingly, point mutations that ablate ORF57 nucleolar localization lead to a failure of ORF57-mediated viral mRNA nuclear export. Furthermore, nucleolar retargeting of the ORF57 mutant was achieved by the incorporation of the HIV-1 Rev nucleolar localization signal, and analysis demonstrated that this modification was sufficient to restore viral mRNA nuclear export. This finding represents a unique and fundamental role for the nucleolus in nuclear export of viral mRNA.","Boyne, James R; Whitehouse, Adrian",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17005724/,476

S1utt is composed of the entire 769-amino-acid (aa) S1 protein; S1NM, S1N, S1n(330), and S1n(220) are deletion mutants with 594, 453, 330, and 220 aa from the N terminus of the S1 protein. The expressed S1 deletion mutant proteins were examined for reactivities to a panel of MAbs. All MAbs classified in groups A and B, those reactive to most mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strains and those specific for isolate JHMV, respectively, recognized S1N(330) and the larger S1 deletion mutants but failed to react with S1N(220). MAbs in group C, specific for the larger S protein of JHMV, reacted only with the S1utt protein without any deletion. These results indicated that the domain composed of the N-terminal 330 aa comprised the cluster of conformational epitopes recognized by MAbs in groups A and B. It was also shown that the epitopes of MAbs in group C were not restricted to the region missing in the smaller S protein. These results together with the fact that all MAbs in group B retained high neutralizing activity suggested the possibility that the N-terminal 330 aa are responsible for binding to the MHV-specific receptors. In investigate this possibility, we expressed the receptor protein and examined the binding of each S1 deletion mutant to the receptor. It was demonstrated that the S1N(330) protein as well as other S1 deletion mutants larger than S1N(330) bound to the receptor. These results indicated that a domain composed of 330 aa at the N terminus of the S1 protein is responsible for binding to the MHV-specific receptor.","Kubo, H; Yamada, Y K; Taguchi, F",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7520090/,476

The aim of the study was to investigate the impact of nutritional, mental, functional, disease and pharmacological factors on the survival of nursing home residents with severe disabilities. Material and Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted with a 9-year follow-up period among nursing home residents with a Barthel score ≤40. The initial assessment included the following scales: Mini Nutritional Assessment Short-Form (MNA-SF), Abbreviated Mental Test Score (AMTS), the Barthel Index, and blood pressure (BP) measurements. Comorbidities, medications and all-cause mortality were extracted from medical records. The analyzed cohort was divided into two groups: Deceased - residents who died ≤3 years and Survivors - those who survived >3 years of observation. R e s u l t s: Survivors (n = 40) and Deceased (n = 48) did not differ significantly in terms of age, sex, systolic and diastolic BP, the Barthel Index, number of diseases and medications used. Survivors had significantly higher scores in MNA-SF (p <0.001) and AMTS (p <0.003) than Deceased. Moreover, Survivors had hypertension significantly more often and took aspirin and ACE inhibitors (p <0.05). The multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that the MNA-SF score significantly affected mortality [OR = 0.62, (95%CI, 0.46-0.84), p <0.001]. C o n c l u s i o n: Higher MNA-SF scores were a factor that significantly affected the survival of nursing home residents, while functional status assessed using the Barthel Index had no effect on survival.

202204,COVID-19 response,2020,"V-ATPase (vesicular H(+)-ATPase)-driven intravesicular acidification is crucial for vesicular trafficking. Defects in vesicular acidification and trafficking have recently been recognized as essential determinants of various human diseases. An important role of endosomal acidification in receptor-ligand dissociation and in activation of lysosomal hydrolytic enzymes is well established. However, the molecular mechanisms by which luminal pH information is transmitted to the cytosolic small GTPases that control trafficking events such as budding, coat formation and fusion are unknown. Here, we discuss our recent discovery that endosomal V-ATPase is a pH-sensor regulating the degradative pathway. According to our model, V-ATPase is responsible for: (i) the generation of a pH gradient between vesicular membranes; (ii) sensing of intravesicular pH; and (iii) transmitting this information to the cytosolic side of the membrane. We also propose the hypothetical molecular mechanism involved in function of the V-ATPase a2-subunit as a putative pH-sensor. Based on extensive experimental evidence on the crucial role of histidine residues in the function of PSPs (pH-sensing proteins) in eukaryotic cells, we hypothesize that pH-sensitive histidine residues within the intra-endosomal loops and/or C-terminal luminal tail of the a2-subunit could also be involved in the pH-sensing function of V-ATPase. However, in order to identify putative pH-sensitive histidine residues and to test this hypothesis, it is absolutely essential that we increase our understanding of the folding and transmembrane topology of the a-subunit isoforms of V-ATPase. Thus the crucial role of intra-endosomal histidine residues in pH-dependent conformational changes of the V-ATPase a2-isoform, its interaction with cytosolic small GTPases and ultimately in its acidification-dependent regulation of the endosomal/lysosomal protein degradative pathway remain to be determined.","Marshansky, V",Biochemical Society transactions,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17956287/,476

OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to develop and propose an item set that was suitable for describing and monitoring nationally issued COVID-19 contact tracing apps. This item set could provide a framework for describing the key technical features of such apps and monitoring their use based on widely available information. METHODS: We used an open-source intelligence approach (OSINT) to access a multitude of publicly available sources and collect data and information regarding the development and use of contact tracing apps in different countries over several months (from June 2020 to January 2021). The collected documents were then iteratively analyzed via content analysis methods. During this process, an initial set of subject areas were refined into categories for evaluation (ie, coherent topics), which were then examined for individual features. These features were paraphrased as items in the form of questions and applied to information materials from a sample of countries (ie, Brazil, China, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, and the United Kingdom [England and Wales]). This sample was purposefully selected; our intention was to include the apps of different countries from around the world and to propose a valid item set that can be relatively easily applied by using an OSINT approach. RESULTS: Our OSINT approach and subsequent analysis of the collected documents resulted in the definition of the following five main categories and associated subcategories: (1) background information (open-source code, public information, and collaborators); (2) purpose and workflow (secondary data use and warning process design); (3) technical information (protocol, tracing technology, exposure notification system, and interoperability); (4) privacy protection (the entity of trust and anonymity); and (5) availability and use (release date and the number of downloads). Based on this structure, a set of items that constituted the evaluation framework were specified. The application of these items to the 10 selected countries revealed differences, especially with regard to the centralization of the entity of trust and the overall transparency of the apps' technical makeup.

The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of the lockdown on digital device usage, and consequently, the ocular surface health implications and circadian rhythm abnormalities related to digital eye strain. Methods: An open online survey was sent through various social media platforms and was open for a period of 2 weeks. Results: A total of 407 usable responses were obtained; the average age of respondents was 27.4 years. Typically, 93.6% of respondents reported an increase in their screen time since the lockdown was declared. The average increase in digital device usage was calculated at about 4.8 ± 2.8 h per day. The total usage per day was found to be 8.65 ± 3.74 hours. Sleep disturbances have been reported by 62.4% of people.

204980,Transparency about death: students on COVID-19,2020,"Since influenza occurs globally every year, it is important to develop a facile and accurate method to detect the influenza virus. This study aimed at developing a sensitive fluorometric assay for detecting influenza viral RNA through tandem gene amplification methods including reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), followed by strand displacement amplification (SDA) coupled with rolling circle amplification (RCA). Influenza viral RNA was initially amplified by RT-PCR with a tailed reverse primer containing an additional sequence for SDA. The RT-PCR amplicon was then subjected to SDA, yielding multiple copies of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) that can be used as a primer for subsequent RCA. Thereafter, a long ssDNA segment harboring tandem repeated G-quadruplexes that were generated through RCA was intercalated by Thioflavin T, yielding a strong fluorescence signal indicating the presence of the target viral RNA. Fluorometric analysis detected influenza viral RNA ranging from 50 pg to 500 pg with a limit of detection of 6.2 pg with a signal-to-background ratio of 10 and identified each influenza virus strain (H1N1, H3N2, and influenza B). Thus, the present method for the label-free fluorometric detection of viral RNA via tandem gene amplifications combining RT-PCR-coupled SDA and G-quadruplex-generating RCA would facilitate the efficient diagnosis of influenza infection.","Lee, Hyobeen; Kim, Dong-Min; Kim, Dong-Eun",Analyst,,476

The research method used is qualitative research using sociological approach and qawaidh al-fiqhiyyah. The results showed that the halal fatwa of COVID-19 vaccine produced by Sinovac based on MUI fatwa no. 2 Year 2021 by using three fiqh rules namely al-dhararu yuzal (harm must be eliminated), al-daf'u awla mina al-raf'i (preventing more important than eliminating) and yahtamil al-dharar al-khos lidaf'iy al-dhorar al-'am (shouldering / bear certain harms in order to prevent the onset of harm that is evenly distributed). The implementation of this fatwa is strongly felt by health workers in the Tanjung Morawa Health Center, Deli Serdang Regency. The halal COVID-19 vaccine produced by Sinovac adds to the readiness of health workers to receive vaccines. Health workers who are Muslims are also aware of the consideration of fiqh rules in the MUI fatwa. side effects of vaccines that have been feared by some people turned out not to be experienced significantly by health workers who have been vaccinated, this adds to the level of accuracy of the fiqh rules used by MUI in consideration of the evidence in its fatwa.","Siddik, Ibnu Radwan; id,",Al-Mashlahah: Jurnal Hukum Islam Dan Pranata Sosial,,476

206302,COVID-19: Challenges and opportunities for dermatology response,2020,"Rationale: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2), and TMPRSS2 (transmembrane protease serine 2) mediate viral infection of host cells. We reasoned that differences in ACE2 or TMPRSS2 gene expression in sputum cells among patients with asthma may identify subgroups at risk for COVID-19 morbidity.Objectives: To determine the relationship between demographic features and sputum ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene expression in asthma.Methods: We analyzed gene expression for ACE2 and TMPRSS2, and for ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule 1) (rhinovirus receptor as a comparator) in sputum cells from 330 participants in SARP-3 (Severe Asthma Research Program-3) and 79 healthy control subjects.Measurements and Main Results: Gene expression of ACE2 was lower than TMPRSS2, and expression levels of both genes were similar in asthma and health. Among patients with asthma, male sex, African American race, and history of diabetes mellitus were associated with higher expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) was associated with lower expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, but treatment with triamcinolone acetonide did not decrease expression of either gene. These findings differed from those for ICAM-1, where gene expression was increased in asthma and less consistent differences were observed related to sex, race, and use of ICS.Conclusions: Higher expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in males, African Americans, and patients with diabetes mellitus provides rationale for monitoring these asthma subgroups for poor COVID-19 outcomes. The lower expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 with ICS use warrants prospective study of ICS use as a predictor of decreased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and decreased COVID-19 morbidity.","Peters, Michael C; Sajuthi, Satria; Deford, Peter; Christenson, Stephanie; Rios, Cydney L; Montgomery, Michael T; Woodruff, Prescott G; Mauger, David T; Erzurum, Serpil C; Johansson, Mats W; Denlinger, Loren C; Jarjour, Nizar N; Castro, Mario; Hastie, Annette T; Moore, Wendy; Ortega, Victor E; Bleecker, Eugene R; Wenzel, Sally E; Israel, Elliot; Levy, Bruce D; Seibold, Max A; Fahy, John V",Am J Respir Crit Care Med,,476

We generated a unique dataset of 81,643 APCs, including monocytes and rare dendritic cell (DC) subsets. We uncovered multi-process defects in antiviral immune defence in specific APCs from patients with severe disease: (1) increased pro-apoptotic pathways in plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs, key effectors of antiviral immunity), (2) a decrease of the innate sensors TLR9 and DHX36 in pDCs and CLEC9a+ DCs, respectively, (3) downregulation of antiviral interferon-stimulated genes in monocyte subsets and (4) a decrease of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-related genes and MHC class II transactivator activity in cDC1c+ DCs, suggesting viral inhibition of antigen presentation.

206509,Bots as Active News Promoters: A Digital Analysis of COVID-19 Tweets,2020,"Hawkes processes are a form of self-exciting process that has been used in numerous applications, including neuroscience, seismology, and terrorism. While these self-exciting processes have a simple formulation, they can model incredibly complex phenomena. Traditionally Hawkes processes are a continuous-time process, however we enable these models to be applied to a wider range of problems by considering a discrete-time variant of Hawkes processes. We illustrate this through the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as a substantive case study. While alternative models, such as compartmental and growth curve models, have been widely applied to the COVID-19 epidemic, the use of discrete-time Hawkes processes allows us to gain alternative insights. This paper evaluates the capability of discrete-time Hawkes processes by modelling daily mortality counts as distinct phases in the COVID-19 outbreak. We first consider the initial stage of exponential growth and the subsequent decline as preventative measures become effective. We then explore subsequent phases with more recent data. Various countries that have been adversely affected by the epidemic are considered, namely, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. These countries are all unique concerning the spread of the virus and their corresponding response measures. However, we find that this simple model is useful in accurately capturing the dynamics of the process, despite hidden interactions that are not directly modelled due to their complexity, and differences both within and between countries. The utility of this model is not confined to the current COVID-19 epidemic, rather this model could explain many other complex phenomena. It is of interest to have simple models that adequately describe these complex processes with unknown dynamics. As models become more complex, a simpler representation of the process can be desirable for the sake of parsimony.","Browning, Raiha; Sulem, Deborah; Mengersen, Kerrie; Rivoirard, Vincent; Rousseau, Judith",PLoS One,,476

207686,Expert Recommendations for US and Global Preparedness for COVID-19,2020,"We present an approach to discriminate SARS-CoV-2 virus types based on their RNA sequence descriptions avoiding a sequence alignment. For that purpose, sequences are preprocessed by feature extraction and the resulting feature vectors are analyzed by prototype-based classification to remain interpretable. In particular, we propose to use variants of learning vector quantization (LVQ) based on dissimilarity measures for RNA sequence data. The respective matrix LVQ provides additional knowledge about the classification decisions like discriminant feature correlations and, additionally, can be equipped with easy to realize reject options for uncertain data. Those options provide self-controlled evidence, i.e., the model refuses to make a classification decision if the model evidence for the presented data is not sufficient. This model is first trained using a GISAID dataset with given virus types detected according to the molecular differences in coronavirus populations by phylogenetic tree clustering. In a second step, we apply the trained model to another but unlabeled SARS-CoV-2 virus dataset. For these data, we can either assign a virus type to the sequences or reject atypical samples. Those rejected sequences allow to speculate about new virus types with respect to nucleotide base mutations in the viral sequences. Moreover, this rejection analysis improves model robustness. Last but not least, the presented approach has lower computational complexity compared to methods based on (multiple) sequence alignment.

In this field, the target sensitivity analysis focuses primarily on capturing the influence of the inputs on the occurrence of such a critical event. This paper proposes new target sensitivity indices, based on the Shapley values and called""target Shapley effects"", allowing for interpretable sensitivity measures under dependent inputs. Two algorithms (one based on Monte Carlo sampling, and a given-data algorithm based on a nearest-neighbors procedure) are proposed for the estimation of these target Shapley effects based on the $\ell^2$ norm. Additionally, the behavior of these target Shapley effects are theoretically and empirically studied through various toy-cases. Finally, the application of these new indices in two real-world use-cases (a river flood model and a COVID-19 epidemiological model) is discussed.","Idrissi, Marouane Il; Chabridon, Vincent; Iooss, Bertrand",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.08083v3.pdf,476

In this study, we investigated the mental perceived impact of PPE use during delivery on the development of maternal postpartum depression (PPD) and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). METHODS: This was a multicenter, retrospective cohort study concerning women who delivered during the COVID-19 pandemic first lockdown period in Israel. Postpartum women were approached and asked to complete a comprehensive online questionnaire. Impact of PPE was graded on a scale of 1-5, and Impact of PPE &#8805;4 was considered high. PPD and PTSS were assessed using the EPDS and City BiTS questionnaires. RESULTS: Of 421 parturients, 36 (9%) reported high Impact of PPE. Parturients with high Impact of PPE had significantly higher PPD and PTSS scores)EPDS 8.4 ± 5.8 vs. 5.7 ± 5.3; City BiTS 9.2 ± 10.3 vs. 5.8 ± 7.8, p < 0.05 for both).

Convalescent plasma has been used to treat a number of infections during pandemics, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and now severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). OBJECTIVES: To summarize the existing literature and registered clinical trials on the efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma for treating coronaviruses, and discuss issues of feasibility, and donor and patient selection. SOURCES: A review of articles published in PubMed was performed on 13 July 2020 to summarize the currently available evidence in human studies for convalescent plasma as a treatment for coronaviruses. The World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry and clinicaltrials.gov were searched to summarize the currently registered randomized clinical trials for convalescent plasma in COVID-19. CONTENT: There were sixteen COVID-19, four MERS and five SARS reports describing convalescent plasma use in humans. There were two randomized control trials, both of which were for COVID-19 and were terminated early. Most COVID-19 reports described a potential benefit of convalescent plasma on clinical outcomes in severe or critically ill patients with few immediate adverse events. However, there were a number of limitations, including the concurrent use of antivirals, steroids and other treatments, small sample sizes, lack of randomization or control groups, and short follow-up time. Data from SARS and COVID-19 suggest that earlier administration probably yields better outcomes. The ideal candidates for recipients and donors are not known. Still, experience with previous coronaviruses tells us that antibodies in convalescent patients are probably short-lived. Patients who had more severe disease and who are earlier in their course of recovery may be more likely to have adequate titres. Finally, a number of practical challenges were identified. IMPLICATIONS: There is currently no effective treatment for COVID-19, and preliminary trials for convalescent plasma suggest that there may be some benefits. However, research to date is at high risk of bias, and randomized control trials are desperately needed to determine the efficacy and safety of this therapeutic option.","Wooding, Denise J; Bach, Horacio",Clin Microbiol Infect,,476

Design: An expert group used multi-criteria decision analysis methods to specify criteria and weights, representing their relative importance, for prioritizing patients with coronovirus 2019 disease with respect to likely clinical benefit. Specialized multi-criteria decision analysis software, implementing the ""Potentially All Pairwise RanKings of all possible Alternatives"" method to determine the weights, was used. Social equity considerations for prioritizing patients were also identified as important. Setting: The prioritization tool was developed in New Zealand. Subjects: An expert group comprising specialists from intensive care medicine and nursing, Maori (New Zealand's indigenous population) health, infectious diseases, and neonatology was formed. The group's work was supported by health economists and decision analysts and overseen by an ethicist and a senior representative from the New Zealand Ministry of Health. Interventions: Multi-criteria decision analysis to create a prioritization tool. Measurements and Main Results: The prioritization tool comprised eight criteria with respect to likely clinical benefit. In decreasing order of importance (weights in parentheses): Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (15.7%), preexisting cardiovascular conditions (15.7%), functional capacity (15.7%), age (12.4%), preexisting respiratory conditions (11.1%), immunocompromised (11.1%), body mass index (9.2%), and other relevant medical conditions (9.2%). Two social equity considerations were also included in the overarching decision framework to be used alongside the clinical criteria: prioritizing Maori and Pacific people (and, potentially, other at-risk groups), and healthcare and other frontline workers. Conclusions: The criteria and weights in the prioritization tool can be easily revised as new evidence emerges. The approach for developing the tool could be used in other countries whose ICUs are at risk of being overwhelmed by the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic to rapidly develop their own prioritization tools. In the event that future crises threaten to overload ICUs, other prioritization tools could also be rapidly developed.","Roy, Melyssa; Hansen, Paul; Sullivan, Trudy; Ombler, Franz; Kiore, Mathew; Stapleton, Andrew; Carr, Craig",Crit Care Explor,,476

However, digestive symptoms have also been reported; at first considered as infrequent, they in fact seem to affect (to some extent) more than half of patients. The symptoms are mainly manifested by anorexia, diarrhea, nausea and/or vomiting and abdominal pain. Even though prognosis is associated with lung injury, digestive symptoms seem significantly more frequent in patients presenting with severe COVID-19 infection. Digestive forms, which may be isolated or which can precede pulmonary symptoms, have indeed been reported, with diarrhea as a leading clinical sign. The main biological abnormalities that can suggest COVID-19 infection at an early stage are lymphopenia, elevated CRP and heightened ASAT transaminases. Thoraco-abdominal scan seems useful as a means of on the one hand ruling out digestive pathology not connected with coronavirus and on the other hand searching for pulmonary images compatible with COVID-19 infection. No data exist on the interest of digestive endoscopy in cases of persistent digestive symptoms. Moreover, the endoscopic surgeons may themselves be at significant risk of contamination. Fecal-oral transmission of the infection is possible, especially insofar as viral shedding in stools seems frequent and of longer duration than at the ENT level, including in patients with negative throat swab and without digestive symptoms. In some doubtful cases, virologic assessment of stool samples can yield definitive diagnosis. In the event of prolonged viral shedding in stools, a patient's persistent contagiousness is conceivable but not conclusively established. Upcoming serology should enable identification of the patients having been infected by the COVID-19 epidemic, particularly among previously undetected pauci-symptomatic members of a health care staff.

However, there are Dynamic Spectrum Access technologies in the unused VHF and UHF analog TV band called TV White Space that can be used to provide high-speed Wi-Fi access over wide coverage and at lower cost. Since March 2020, courses have been suspended at the University of Bangui to effectively limit and combat the COVID-19 pandemic. After a three-month period of containment, academic activities have resumed. The increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 contamination raises concerns about this resumption. Given the rules of social distancing that limit the number of students in classrooms, the risks of travelling by public transport and the lack of motivation of some students following years of war, the University of Bangui can organize distance learning as a transitional measure. This paper is the subject of a feasibility study on the interconnection of surrounding neighborhoods and villages by TV White Space at the University of Bangui that can accommodate students and teachers for distance learning courses in the context of COVID-19. The methodological approach consists in studying the deployment of a White Space TV network to interconnect the peripheral areas at the University of Bangui, then using the Moodle distance learning platform on which we integrate the virtual classroom plugin, deployed locally and running without Internet connectivity. The bandwidth of the White Space TV will be important to practice the educational activities without spending money to pay the Internet credits of the operators' networks. Students can connect locally via Wi-Fi in the areas covered by the platform and follow the different academic activities according to their geographical location, while others closer to the university can go to the classroom to attend classes with the professor in the rules enacted for protection against COVID-19.

Also, the principal features of the preclinical and clinical studies of pioneering COVID-19 vaccine candidates were pointed out by reviewing the available information. Finally, we discuss the key challenges in the successful design of the COVID-19 vaccine and address the most fundamental strengths and weaknesses of common vaccine platforms.","Bayat, Maryam; Asemani, Yahya; Najafi, Sajad",Int Immunopharmacol,,476
211565,COVID-19-related thromboinflammatory status: Microclots and beyond (editorial),2020,"At the beginning of 2020 the world has seen the initial outbreak of COVID-19, a disease caused by SARS-CoV2 virus in China. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared this disease as a pandemic on March 11 2020. As the disease spread globally, it becomes difficult to tract the transmission dynamics of this disease in all countries, as they may differ in geographical, demographic and strategical aspects. In this short note, the author proposes the utilization of a type of neural network to generate a global topological map for these dynamics, in which countries that share similar dynamics are mapped adjacently, while countries with significantly different dynamics are mapped far from each other. The author believes that this kind of topological map can be useful for further analyzing and comparing the correlation between the diseases dynamics with strategies to mitigate this global crisis in an intuitive manner. Some initial experiments with with time series of patients numbers in more than 240 countries are explained in this note.","Hartono, Pitoyo",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.01481v2.pdf,476

211786,Private Equity and COVID-19,2020,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim of this report is to describe the main aspects of sex-related differences in non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathies (DCM), focusing on chemotherapy-induced heart failure (HF) and investigating the possible therapeutic implications and clinical management applications in the era of personalized medicine. RECENT FINDINGS: In cardio-oncology, molecular and multimodality imaging studies confirm that sex differences do exist, affecting the therapeutic cardioprotective strategies and, therefore, the long-term outcomes. Interestingly, compelling evidences suggest that sex-specific characteristics in drug toxicity might predict differences in the therapeutic response, most likely due to the tangled interplay between cancer and HF, which probably share common underlying mechanisms. Cardiovascular diseases show many sex-related differences in prevalence, etiology, phenotype expression, and outcomes. Complex molecular mechanisms underlie this diverse pathological manifestations, from sex-determined differential gene expression to sex hormone interaction with their receptors in the heart. Non-ischemic DCM is an umbrella definition that incorporates several etiologies, including chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathies. The role of sex as a risk factor for cardiotoxicity is poorly explored. However, understanding the various features of disease manifestation and outcomes is of paramount importance for a prompt and tailored evaluation.","D039,; Amario, Domenico; Camilli, Massimiliano; Migliaro, Stefano; Canonico, Francesco; Galli, Mattia; Arcudi, Alessandra; Montone, Rocco Antonio; Borovac, Josip Andjelo; Crea, Filippo; Savarese, Gianluigi",Curr Cardiol Rep,,476

Accessing and sharing data to foster collaboration],2020,"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of COVID-19 has caused a continuing global pandemic. Hospitals are integral to the control and prevention of COVID-19; however, they are facing numerous challenges during the epidemic. OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to introduce the practical experience of the design and implementation of a web-based COVID-19 service platform at a tertiary hospital in China as well as the preliminary results of the implementation. METHODS: The web-based COVID-19 service platform was deployed within the health care system of the Guangdong Second Provincial General Hospital and Internet Hospital; the function of the platform was to provide web-based medical services for both members of the public and lay health care workers. The focal functions of this system included automated COVID-19 screening, related symptom monitoring, web-based consultation, and psychological support; it also served as a COVID-19 knowledge hub. The design and process of each function are introduced. The usage data for the platform service were collected and are represented by three periods: the pre-epidemic period (December 22, 2019, to January 22, 2020, 32 days), the controlled period (January 23 to March 31, 2020, 69 days), and the postepidemic period (April 1 to June 30, 2020, 91 days). RESULTS: By the end of June 2020, 96,642 people had used the automated COVID-19 screening and symptom monitoring systems 161,884 and 7,795,194 times, respectively. The number of general web-based consultation services per day increased from 30 visits in the pre-epidemic period to 122 visits during the controlled period, then dropped to 73 visits in the postepidemic period. The psychological counseling program served 636 clients during the epidemic period. For people who used the automated COVID-19 screening service, 160,916 (99.40%) of the total users were classified in the no risk category. 464 (0.29%) of the people were categorized as medium to high risk, and 12 people (0.01%) were recommended for further COVID-19 testing and treatment. Among the 96,642 individuals who used the COVID-19 related symptoms monitoring service, 6696 (6.93%) were symptomatic at some point during the monitoring period. Fever was the most frequently reported symptom, with 2684/6696 symptomatic people (40.1%) having had this symptom. Cough and sore throat were also relatively frequently reported by the 6696 symptomatic users (1657 people, 24.7%, and 1622 people, 24.2%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The web-based COVID-19 service platform implemented at a tertiary hospital in China is exhibited to be a role model for using digital health technologies to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. The digital solutions of automated COVID-19 screening, daily symptom monitoring, web-based care, and knowledge propagation have plausible acceptability and feasibility for complementing offline hospital services and facilitating disease control and prevention.","Lian, Wanmin; Wen, Li; Zhou, Qiru; Zhu, Weijie; Duan, Wenzhou; Xiao, Xiongzhi; Mhungu, Florence; Huang, Wenchen; Li, Chongchong; Cheng, Weibin; Tian, Junzhang",J Med Internet Res,,476

212626,COVID-19's impact on telehealth,2020,"Since 2002, the world has witnessed major outbreaks of acute respiratory illness by three zoonotic coronaviruses (CoVs), which differ from each other in pathogenicity. Reasons for the lower pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 than the other two zoonotic coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, are not well understood. We herein compared the codon usage patterns of the three zoonotic CoVs causing severe acute respiratory syndromes and four human-specific CoVs (NL63, 229E, OC43, and HKU1) causing mild diseases. We found that the seven viruses have different codon usages, with SARS-CoV-2 having the lowest effective number of codons (ENC) among the zoonotic CoVs. Human codon adaptation index (CAI) analysis revealed that the CAI value of SARS-CoV-2 is the lowest among the zoonotic CoVs. The ENC and CAI values of SARS-CoV-2 were more similar to those of the less-pathogenic human-specific CoVs. To further investigate adaptive evolution within SARS-CoV-2, we examined codon usage patterns in 3573 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 collected over the initial 4 months of the pandemic. We showed that the ENC values and the CAI values of SARS-CoV-2 were decreasing over the period. The low ENC and CAI values could be responsible for the lower pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. While mutational pressure appears to shape codon adaptation in the overall genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and other zoonotic CoVs, the E gene of SARS-CoV-2, which has the highest codon usage bias, appears to be under strong natural selection. Data from the study contribute to our understanding of the pathogenicity and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in humans.","Huang, Wanyi; Guo, Yaqiong; Li, Na; Feng, Yaoyu; Xiao, Lihua",Infect Genet Evol,,476
212780,Environmental Cleaning and Disinfection Recommendations: Interim Recommendations for US Community Facilities with Suspected/Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the newly emerging viral disease, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The epidemic sparked in December 2019 at Wuhan city, China that causes a large global outbreak and a major public health catastrophe. Till now, more than 129 million positive cases have been reported in which more than 2.81 million were dead, surveyed by Johns Hopkins University, USA. The diverse symptoms of COVID-19 and an increased number of positive cases throughout the world hypothesize that this virus assembles more variants that are preventing the pursuit of its adequate treatment as well as the development of the vaccine. In this study, 715 SARS-CoV-2 genomes were retrieved from the gisaid and NCBI viral resources involving 39 countries and 164 different types of variants were identified based on 108 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in which the ancestral type of SARS-CoV-2 was found as the most frequent and the most prevalent in China. Moreover, variant type A104 was identified as the most frequent in the USA and A52 in Japan. The study also recognized the most common SNPs such as 241, 3037, 8782, 11083, 14408, 23403, and 28144 as well as variants regarding base-pair, C > T. A total of 65 non-synonymous SNPs were recognized which were mostly located in nucleocapsid phosphoprotein, Non-structural protein 3(Nsp3), and spike glycoprotein encoding gene. Molecular divergence analysis revealed that this virus was phylogenetically related to Yunnan 2013 bat strain. This study indicates SARS-CoV-2 frequently alters their genetic material, which mostly affects the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein, and spike glycoprotein-encoding gene and makes it very challenging to develop SARS-Cov-2 vaccine and antibody-mediated rapid diagnostic kit.","Das, Avizit; Khurshid, Sarah; Ferdausi, Aleya; Nipu, Eshita Sadhak; Das, Amit; Ahmed, Fee Faysal",Comput Biol Chem,,476
212921,"Mobility, exposure, and epidemiological timelines of COVID-19 infections in China outside Hubei province",2021,"The ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been a public health emergency of international concern. Although SARS-CoV-2 is considered to be mainly transmitted by inhalation of contaminated droplets and aerosols, SARS-CoV-2 is also detected in human feces and to a less extent in urine, and in raw wastewaters (to date viral RNA only) suggesting that other routes of infection may exist. Monitoring SARS-CoV-2 genomes in wastewaters has been proposed as a complementary approach for tracing the dynamics of virus transmission within human population connected to wastewater network. The understanding on SARS-CoV-2 transmission through wastewater surveillance, the development of epidemic modeling and the evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from contaminated wastewater are largely limited by our knowledge on viral RNA genome persistence and virus infectivity preservation in such an environment. Using an integrity based RT-qPCR assay this study led to the discovery that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can persist under several forms in wastewaters, which provides important information on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in raw wastewaters and associated risk assessment.","Wurtzer, S; Waldman, P; Ferrier-Rembert, A; Frenois-Veyrat, G; Mouchel, J M; Boni, M; Maday, Y; Marechal, V; Moulin, L",Water Res,,476

However, it is far from clear what the psychological consequences of this shift to virtual face-to-face communication are and if there are methods to alleviate ""videoconferencing fatigue"". We have studied the influence of emotions of meeting participants on the perceived outcome of video meetings. Our experimental setting consisted of 35 participants collaborating in eight teams over Zoom in a one semester course on Collaborative Innovation Networks in bi-weekly video meetings, where each team presented its progress. Emotion was tracked through Zoom face video snapshots using facial emotion recognition that recognized six emotions (happy, sad, fear, anger, neutral, and surprise). Our dependent variable was a score given after each presentation by all participants except the presenter. We found that the happier the speaker is, the happier and less neutral the audience is. More importantly, we found that the presentations that triggered wide swings in ""fear"" and ""joy"" among the participants are correlated with a higher rating. Our findings provide valuable input for online video presenters on how to conduct better and less tiring meetings;this will lead to a decrease in ""videoconferencing fatigue"".","Rossler, J.; Sun, J.

215342,Clinical and laboratory factors associated with severe disease course in Turkish patients with COVID-19 infection,2021,"Transdermal drug delivery systems (TDDS) have many advantages and represent an excellent alternative to oral delivery and hypodermic injections. TDDS are more convenient and less invasive tools for disease and viral infection treatment, prevention, detection, and surveillance. The emerging development of microneedles for TDDS has facilitated improved skin barrier penetration for the delivery of macromolecules or hydrophilic drugs. Microneedle TDDS patches can be fabricated to deliver virus vaccines and potentially provide a viable alternative vaccine modality that offers improved immunogenicity, thermostability, simplicity, safety, and compliance as well as sharp-waste reduction, increased cost-effectiveness, and the capacity for self-administration, which could improve vaccine distribution. These advantages make TDDS-based vaccine delivery an especially well-suited option for treatment of widespread viral infectious diseases including pandemics. Because microneedle-based bioassays employ transdermal extraction of interstitial fluid or blood, they can be used as a minimally invasive approach for surveying disease markers and providing point-of-care (POC) diagnostics. For cutaneous viral infections, TDDS can provide localized treatment with high specificity and less systemic toxicity. In summary, TDDS, especially those that employ microneedles, possess special attributes that can be leveraged to reduce morbidity and mortality from viral infectious diseases. In this regard, they may have considerable positive impact as a modality for improving global health. In this article, we introduce the possible role and summarize the current literature regarding TDDS applications for fighting common cutaneous or systemic viral infectious diseases, including herpes simplex, varicella or herpes zoster, warts, influenza, measles, and COVID-19.","Wang, Fang-Ying; Chen, Yunching; Huang, Yi-You; Cheng, Chao-Min",Drug deliv. transl. res.

As a result, current information is mainly based on reports and case series. OBJECTIVE: To analyse the psychopathological characteristics and the grouping of the symptoms of the Cotard's syndrome cases reported in the medical literature. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature of all reported cases of Cotard's syndrome from 2005 to January 2018 was performed in the MEDLINE/PubMed database. Demographic variables and clinical characteristics of each case were collected. An exploratory factor analysis of the symptoms was performed. RESULTS: The search identified 86 articles, of which 69 were potentially relevant. After reviewing the full texts, 55 articles were selected for the systematic review, in which we found 69 cases. We found that the diagnosis of major depression (P<0.001) and organic mental disorder (P=0.004) were more frequent in the older group with Cotard's syndrome. An exploratory factor analysis extracted 3 factors: psychotic depression, in which it includes patients with delusions of guilt (0.721), suicidal ideas (0.685), delusions of damnation (0.662), nihilistic delusions of the body (0.642), depression (0.522), and hypochondriacal delusions (0.535); delusive-hallucinatory, with patients who presented delusions of immortality (0.566), visual hallucinations (0.545) and nihilistic delusions of existence (0.451), and mixed, with patients who presented nihilistic delusions of concepts (0.702), anxiety (0.573), and auditory hallucinations (0.560). CONCLUSIONS: The psychopathology of Cotard's syndrome is more complex than the simple association with the delusion of being dead, since it encompasses a factorial structure organised into 3 factors.","Huarcaya-Victoria, Jeff; Bojórquez-De la Torre, José; De la Cruz-Oré, Jorge",Rev Colomb Psiquiatr,,476
215701,Understanding Changes in Travel Patterns during the COVID-19 Outbreak in the Three Major Metropolitan Areas of Japan,2020-12-24,"This article investigates the prevalence of high and low quality URLs shared on Twitter when users discuss COVID-19. We distinguish between high quality health sources, traditional news sources, and low quality misinformation sources. We find that misinformation, in terms of tweets containing URLs from low quality misinformation websites, is shared at a higher rate than tweets containing URLs on high quality health information websites. However, both are a relatively small proportion of the overall conversation. In contrast, news sources are shared at a much higher rate. These findings lead us to analyze the network created by the URLs referenced on the webpages shared by Twitter users. When looking at the combined network formed by all three of the source types, we find that the high quality health information network, the low quality misinformation network, and the news information network are all well connected with a clear community structure. While high and low quality sites do have connections to each other, the connections to and from news sources are more common, highlighting the central brokerage role news sources play in this information ecosystem. Our findings suggest that while low quality URLs are not extensively shared in the COVID-19 Twitter conversation, a well connected community of low quality COVID-19 related information has emerged on the web, and both health and news sources are connecting to this community.","Singh, Lisa; Bode, Leticia; Budak, Ceren; Kawintiranon, Kornraphop; Padden, Colton; Vraga, Emily",J Comput Soc Sci,,476

215906,Assisted dying and Covid-19,2021,"Patients who are hospitalized for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) face an extremely stressful experience that might challenge their mental health. The study aims to describe the psychological condition of recovered patients, focusing on anxiety and depression symptoms, as well as post-traumatic stress. All the recovered COVID-19 patients who accessed to a multi- disciplinary follow-up screening program scheduled within two months after their hospital discharge were included. As far as the psychological assessment, patients completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised for post-traumatic stress. Socio-demographic and clinical data (days of hospitalization, intensity of received care, and number of supportive sessions with the hospital psychologist after the hospitalization) were collected. Descriptive, correlation and regression analyses were conducted. The sample includes 261 patients (68.2% men), aged between 23 and 90 (mean=58.9 st. dev=13.3). High numbers of patients reported anxiety (28%) and depression symptoms (17%), as well as post-traumatic stress (36.4%). Impaired outcomes were associated with female gender, while patient's age was found to be negatively correlated with anxiety symptoms. 13.8% of patients underwent a psychological visit and 6.1% of them were taken in charge for psychological support. Few months after hospital discharge, individuals recovered by COVID-19 reported negative consequences on their mental health. Understanding the impact that COVID-19 and hospitalization have on recovered patients may provide in- sights about how to develop an effective psychological intervention to help them deal with such psychological distress and prevent further psychopathological effects.

216322,Managing Blood Supply during Pandemic COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious disease caused by the new coronavirus. Previous studies have shown that the chest CT examination plays an important role in the diagnosis and monitoring of COVID-19. However, some patients with COVID-19 had low white blood cell counts and reduced lymphocyte ratios. Multiple CT examinations may cause radiation damages as well as increase the apoptosis of peripheral blood lymphocytes. A new low-dose CT method should be developed because the regular CT may aggravate the disease. METHOD: Sixty cases were randomly divided into the study group (n = 30) and control group (n = 30). The lung window was reconstructed by Karl 3D iterative technique in the study group. The image quality was subjectively evaluated by two senior chest group diagnostic physicians using a 5-point double-blind method. The value of CT measurement and its standard deviation (SD) was used as an objective evaluation criteria. The volume of CT dose index (CTDIvol), dose length product (DLP) and effective dose (ED) from the two groups were compared and analyzed statistically. RESULT: There was no significant difference in the occurrence rates of ground glass opacities, consolidation, crazy-paving pattern, fiber cable shadow and axial interstitial thickening between the study group and control group (p > 0.05). In addition, no significant difference was found for the subjective score of overall image quality and image noise level (SD) between the two groups (p > 0.05). However, significant differences was found in CTDIvol, DLP, and ED between the study group and the control group (p < 0.05). The effective dose of the study group was reduced by 76% compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: CareDose 4D low-dose scanning combined with Karl 3D iterative reconstruction technology can not only greatly reduce the radiation dose, but also provide images that meet the diagnostic criteria of COVID-19, which can be used as a routine method for the follow-up of COVID-19 patients.","Li, Jiawei; Wang, Xiao; Huang, Xiaolu; Chen, Fangxing; Zhang, Xuesong; Liu, Ying; Luo, Guangzuo; Xu, Xunhua",BMC Med Imaging,,476
216509,The impact of COVID-19: virtual assessment and the new normal,2021,"The current health crisis resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic increases the stress and anxiety levels in some professions, including social work. The present research aimed to determine the burnout levels of social workers in Spain during the first wave of the pandemic and the predictive variables. The methodological approach used was developed from a quantitative perspective through a simple random sampling from the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) on a sample of Spanish social workers. The results showed high levels of emotional exhaustion (70.1%) and depersonalization (48.5%), although the data related to a reduced sense of personal accomplishment (36.6%) was low. The burnout level was 20.4%, a reduced record considering the values of the first two subscales. In contrast, the logistic regressions carried out showed that teleworking and psychological treatment are predictive variables of emotional exhaustion. With depersonalization, age (41-50 years) and the perception of needing psychological or psychiatric treatment in the future act as predictive variables. In critical scenarios such as a pandemic, work organizations should implement measures to reduce the high percentages of emotional exhaustion, the workload, and the dehumanization of professionals, a consequence linked to depersonalization.","Martínez-López, José Ángel; Lázaro-Pérez, Cristina; Gómez-Galán, José",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,476

216591,Federal Aid to School Districts during the Covid-19 Recession,2020,"BACKGROUND: Since the beginning of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) disease outbreak, there has been an increasing interest in finding a potential therapeutic agent for the disease. Considering the matter of time, the computational methods of drug repurposing offer the best chance of selecting one drug from a list of approved drugs for the life-threatening condition of COVID-19. The present systematic review aims to provide an overview of studies that have used computational methods for drug repurposing in COVID-19. METHODS: We undertook a systematic search in five databases and included original articles in English that applied computational methods for drug repurposing in COVID-19. RESULTS: Twenty-one original articles utilizing computational drug methods for COVID-19 drug repurposing were included in the systematic review. Regarding the quality of eligible studies, high-quality items including the use of two or more approved drug databases, analysis of molecular dynamic simulation, multi-target assessment, the use of crystal structure for the generation of the target sequence, and the use of AutoDock Vina combined with other docking tools occurred in about 52%, 38%, 24%, 48%, and 19% of included studies. Studies included repurposed drugs mainly against non-structural proteins of SARS-CoV2: the main 3C-like protease (Lopinavir, Ritonavir, Indinavir, Atazanavir, Nelfinavir, and Clocortolone), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Remdesivir and Ribavirin), and the papain-like protease (Mycophenolic acid, Telaprevir, Boceprevir, Grazoprevir, Darunavir, Chloroquine, and Formoterol). The review revealed the best-documented multi-target drugs repurposed by computational methods for COVID-19 therapy as follows: antiviral drugs commonly used to treat AIDS/HIV (Atazanavir, Efavirenz, and Dolutegravir Ritonavir, Raltegravir, and Darunavir, Lopinavir, Saquinavir, Nelfinavir, and Indinavir), HCV (Grazoprevir, Lomibuvir, Asunaprevir, Ribavirin, and Simeprevir), HBV (Entecavir), HSV (Penciclovir), CMV (Ganciclovir), and Ebola (Remdesivir), anticoagulant drug (Dabigatran), and an antifungal drug (Itraconazole). CONCLUSIONS: The present systematic review provides a list of existing drugs that have the potential to influence SARS-CoV2 through different mechanisms of action. For the majority of these drugs, direct clinical evidence on their efficacy for the treatment of COVID-19 is lacking. Future clinical studies examining these drugs might come to conclude, which can be more useful to inhibit COVID-19 progression.","Mohamed, Kawthar; Yazdanpanah, Niloufar; Saghazadeh, Amene; Rezaei, Nima",Bioorg Chem,,476
216790,The Lingering Effects of COVID-19,2020,"Ever since the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), people have been flooded with vast amounts of information related to the virus and its social consequences. This paper draws on social amplification theory and the extended parallel process model (EPPM) and assesses the following: (a) how two amplification stations-news media and peoples' personal networks-influence the risk-related perceptions of people (perceived efficacy and perceived threat) and (b) how these risk-related perceptions impact people's health-protective behaviors. This study surveyed 1,946 participants. The results indicate that peoples' exposure to news media significantly and positively predicted both perceived efficacy and perceived threat. It also shows that peoples' exposure to risk-related information through their personal networks negatively predicted their perceived efficacy, but it positively predicted their perceived threat. The mediating effect of fear was examined, and the result was contradictory to the EPPM. In short, this study reveals the underlying mechanism of individuals' exposure to risk information, processing, and precautionary measures.","Zhao, S.; Wu, X.",Frontiers in Psychology,,476

Researchers are working against the clock to ramp up research studies addressing every angle of COVID-19 - gaining a better understanding of person-to-person transmission, improving methods for diagnosis, and developing therapies to treat infection and vaccines to prevent it. The impact of the virus on research efforts is not limited to investigators and their teams. Potential participants also face unparalleled opportunities and requests to participate in research, which can result in a significant amount of participant fatigue. The Vanderbilt Institute for Clinical and Translational Research recognized early in the pandemic that a solution to assist researchers in the rapid identification of potential participants was critical, and thus developed the COVID-19 Recruitment Data Mart. This solution does not rest solely on technology; the addition of experienced project managers to support researchers and facilitate collaboration was essential. Since the platform and study support tools were launched on July 20, 2020, four studies have been onboarded and a total of 1693 potential participant matches have been shared. Each of these patients had agreed in advance to direct contact for COVID-19 research and had been matched to study-specific inclusion/exclusion criteria. Our innovative Data Mart system is scalable and looks promising as a generalizable solution for simultaneously recommending individuals from a pool of patients against a pool of time-sensitive trial opportunities.","Helmer, Tara T; Lewis, Adam A; McEver, Mark; Delacqua, Francesco; Pastern, Cindy L; Kennedy, Nan; Edwards, Terri L; Woodward, Beverly O; Harris, Paul A",J Biomed Inform,,476

RESULTS: Phases of care with examples of corresponding endocrine cases are outlined. Most cases can be safely postponed with active surveillance, including most differentiated and medullary thyroid cancers. During the most acute phase, all endocrine surgeries are deferred, except thyroid tumors requiring acute airway management.

The aim of this study was to assess the role of tocilizumab in reducing the risk of invasive mechanical ventilation and death in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia who received standard of care treatment. Methods: This retrospective, observational cohort study included adults (≥18 years) with severe COVID-19 pneumonia who were admitted to tertiary care centres in Bologna and Reggio Emilia, Italy, between Feb 21 and March 24, 2020, and a tertiary care centre in Modena, Italy, between Feb 21 and April 30, 2020. All patients were treated with the standard of care (ie, supplemental oxygen, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, antiretrovirals, and low molecular weight heparin), and a non-randomly selected subset of patients also received tocilizumab. Tocilizumab was given either intravenously at 8 mg/kg bodyweight (up to a maximum of 800 mg) in two infusions, 12 h apart, or subcutaneously at 162 mg administered in two simultaneous doses, one in each thigh (ie, 324 mg in total), when the intravenous formulation was unavailable. The primary endpoint was a composite of invasive mechanical ventilation or death. Treatment groups were compared using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression analysis after adjusting for sex, age, recruiting centre, duration of symptoms, and baseline Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. Findings: Of 1351 patients admitted, 544 (40%) had severe COVID-19 pneumonia and were included in the study. 57 (16%) of 365 patients in the standard care group needed mechanical ventilation, compared with 33 (18%) of 179 patients treated with tocilizumab (p=0·41; 16 [18%] of 88 patients treated intravenously and 17 [19%] of 91 patients treated subcutaneously). 73 (20%) patients in the standard care group died, compared with 13 (7%; p&lt;0·0001) patients treated with tocilizumab (six [7%] treated intravenously and seven [8%] treated subcutaneously). After adjustment for sex, age, recruiting centre, duration of symptoms, and SOFA score, tocilizumab treatment was associated with a reduced risk of invasive mechanical ventilation or death (adjusted hazard ratio 0·61, 95% CI 0·40–0·92; p=0·020). 24 (13%) of 179 patients treated with tocilizumab were diagnosed with new infections, versus 14 (4%) of 365 patients treated with standard of care alone (p&lt;0·0001). Interpretation: Treatment with tocilizumab, whether administered intravenously or subcutaneously, might reduce the risk of invasive mechanical ventilation or death in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.

METHODS AND FINDINGS: Prospective, structured questionnaire for all ICU directors in Australia and New Zealand was completed by 69 ICU directors after email invitation from ANZICS. The online questionnaire was accessible for three weeks during September 2020 and analysed by cloud-based software. Basic ICU demographics (private or public, metropolitan or rural) and location, purchasing, airway management practices, guideline uptake, checklist and cognitive aid use and staff training relevant to airway management during the COVID-19 pandemic were the main outcome measures. The 69 ICU directors reported significant simulation-based inter-professional airway training of staff (97%), and use of video laryngoscopy (94%), intubation checklists (94%), cognitive aids (83%) and PPE ""spotters"" (89%) during the airway management of patients with COVID-19. Tracheal intubation was almost always performed by a Specialist (97% of ICUs), who was more likely to be an intensivist than an anaesthetist (61% vs 36%). There was a more frequent adoption of specific airway guidelines for the management of COVID-19 patients in public ICUs (94% vs 71%) and reliance on specialist intensivists to perform intubations in private ICUs (92% vs 53%). CONCLUSION: There was a high uptake of a standardised approach to airway management in COVID-19 patients in ICUs in Australia and New Zealand, likely due to endorsement of national guidelines.","Brewster, David J; Nickson, Christopher P; McGloughlin, Steve; Pilcher, David; Sarode, Vineet V; Gatward, Jonathan J",PLoS One,,476

217192,The Distribution Pattern of Covid-19 in Indonesia: Study Using Spatial Autocorelation,2021,"Marine ecosystems are generally expected to have bottom-heavy trophic structure (more plants than animals) due to size-based constraints arising from increased metabolic requirements and inefficient energy transfer. However, size-based (allometric) approaches are often limited to confined trophic-level windows where energy transfer is predicted by size alone and are constrained to a balance between bottom-up and top-down control at steady state. In real food webs, energy flow is more complex and imbalances in top-down and bottom-up processes can also shape trophic structure. We expand the size-based theory to account for complex food webs and show that moderate levels of food web connectance allow for inverted trophic structure more often than predicted, especially in marine ecosystems. Trophic structure inversion occurs due to the incorporation of complex energy pathways and top-down effects on ecosystems. Our results suggest that marine ecosystems should be top-heavy, and observed bottom-heavy trophic structure may be a result of human defaunation of the ocean that has been more extreme than presently recognized.","Woodson, C B; Schramski, J R; Joye, S B",Proc Biol Sci,,476

Fever, cough and fatigue are the most commonly reported clinical symptoms. CASE PRESENTATION: A 58-year-old man presented at the emergency department with acute onset haemoptysis. On the fifth day after admission, he developed massive haemoptysis. Computed tomography (CT) angiography of the chest revealed alveolar haemorrhage, more prominent in the left lung. Flexible bronchoscopy confirmed bleeding from the left upper lobe, confirmed by a bronchial arteriography, which was successfully embolized. Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) tested for SARS-CoV-2 using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) repeatedly returned negative. Surprisingly, SARS-CoV-2 was eventually detected in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. CONCLUSIONS: Life-threatening haemoptysis is an unusual presentation of COVID-19, reflecting alveolar bleeding as a rare but possible complication.

To contain the spread of the causative SARS-CoV-2 and prepare the healthcare system, public health interventions, including lockdowns, were imposed on 30 March 2020. These resulted in disruptions in healthcare provision, and movement of people and supply chains. There have been resultant delays in seeking and accessing healthcare by the patients. Additionally, disruption of essential health services in the areas of maternal and child health, sexual and reproductive health services, care for chronic conditions and access to oncological and other specialist services has occurred. Thus, there may be avoidable excess morbidity and mortality from non-COVID-19 causes that is not justifiable by the current local COVID-19 burden. Measures to restore normalcy to essential health services provision as guided by the World Health Organisation and other bodies needs to be considered and implemented urgently, to avoid preventable loss of life and excess morbidity. Adequate infection prevention and control measures must be put in place to ensure continuity of essential services whilst protecting healthcare workers and patients from contracting COVID-19.","Murewanhema, Grant; Makurumidze, Richard",Pan Afr Med J,,476

The majority (2554, 55.9%) of 4572 HCWs were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and 8.8% were found positive. Most of the tested workers were women, but we found higher relative frequency of positivity for men, even after adjustment for age, working area, and occupation. The higher frequency of positive tests in the medicine area is probably explained by the higher concentration in that area of COVID-19 patients. Conversely, the low frequency of positive HCWs in intensive care units is probably explained by the diffuse and continuous use of PPD. Our results show that HCWs in a research and teaching hospital in the most hit Region in Italy had a similar pattern of infection as all other HCWs all over the world.

219209,COVID-19 Drives Consumer Behaviour and Agro-Food Markets towards Healthier and More Sustainable Patterns,2020,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly affected the lives of the global population. It is known that periods of stress and psychological distress can affect women's menstrual cycles. We therefore performed an observational study of women's reproductive health over the course of the pandemic thus far. Materials and Methods: An anonymous digital survey was shared by the authors via social media in September 2020. All women of reproductive age were invited to complete the survey. Results: 1031 women completed the survey. Mean age was 36.7 ± 6.6 years (range, 15-54). 693/70% reported recording their cycles using an app or diary. 233/23% were using hormonal contraception. 441/46% reported a change in their menstrual cycle since the beginning of the pandemic. 483/53% reported worsening premenstrual symptoms, 100/18% reported new menorrhagia (p = 0.003) and 173/30% new dysmenorrhea (p < 0.0001) compared to before the pandemic. 72/9% reported missed periods who not previously missed periods (p = 0.003) and the median number of missed periods was 2 (1-3). 17/21% of those who ""occasionally"" missed periods pre-pandemic missed periods ""often"" during pandemic. 467/45% reported a reduced libido. There was no change in the median cycle length (28 days) or days of bleeding (5) but there was a wider variability of cycle length (p = 0.01) and a 1 day median decrease in the minimum (p < 0.0001) and maximum (p = 0.009) cycle length. Women reported a median 2 kg increase in self-reported weight and a 30-min increase in median weekly exercise. 517/50% of women stated that their diet was worse and 232/23% that it was better than before the pandemic. 407/40% reported working more and 169/16% were working less. Women related a significant increase in low mood (p < 0.0001), poor appetite (p < 0.0001), binge eating (p < 0.0001), poor concentration (p < 0.0001), anxiety (p < 0.0001), poor sleep (p < 0.0001), loneliness (p < 0.0001) and excess alcohol use (p < 0.0001). Specific stressors reported included work stress (499/48%), difficulty accessing healthcare (254/25%), change in financial (201/19%) situation, difficulties with home schooling (191/19%) or childcare (99/10%), family or partner conflict (170/16%), family illness or bereavement (156/15%). Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the reproductive health of women. The long term health implications of this are yet to be determined and future studies should address this.","Phelan, Niamh; Behan, Lucy Ann; Owens, Lisa",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),,476

METHODS: A total of 649 Filipinos answered an online questionnaire, which contained 63 questions. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was utilized to derive the causal relationships of the latent variables construct. RESULTS: SEM showed that understanding of COVID-19 had significant direct effects on perceived vulnerability and perceived severity. Also, perceived vulnerability and perceived severity had significant indirect effects on intention to follow. Intention to follow had significant direct effects on actual behavior and adapted behavior, which subsequently led to perceived effectiveness. Of note, an understanding of COVID-19 was found to have a significant indirect effect on perceived effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: The current study is one of the first studies to analyze factors affecting the perceived effectiveness of COVID-19 prevention measures during the global pandemic. It is proposed that the integrated PMT and extended TPB of this study can be applied and extended to evaluate the perceived effectiveness of COVID-19 measures in other countries that are currently dealing with COVID-19 pandemic.","Prasetyo, Yogi Tri; Castillo, Allysa Mae; Salonga, Louie John; Sia, John Allen; Seneta, Joshua Adam",Int J Infect Dis,,476

With the advent of online streaming services, research in music recommendation services has seen tremendous progress. Modern methods leveraging the listening histories of users for session-based song recommendations have overlooked the significance of features extracted from lyrics and acoustic content. We address the task of song prediction through multiple modalities, including tags, lyrics, and acoustic content. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning approach by refining Attentive Neural Networks using representations derived via a Transformer model for lyrics and Variational Autoencoder for acoustic features. Our model achieves significant improvement in performance over existing state-of-the-art models using lyrical and acoustic features alone. Furthermore, we conduct a study to investigate the impact of users' psychological health on our model's performance.","Vaswani, Kunal; Agrawal, Yudhik; Alluri, Vinoo",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.01001v1.pdf,476

Statues and case law across three jurisdictions;Canada, the United Kingdom, and the Republic of Singapore were retrieved and analyzed. Results: Professional regulatory bodies impose a duty to act in healthcare emergencies. Yet, formal legal protection has not been codified by either professional regulatory bodies or governments. These discrepancies between legal and professional standards leave surgeons vulnerable to litigation. Conclusions: Following our analysis of cases and outcomes within these jurisdictions we propose a framework that provides basic protection to surgeons acting outside their surgical specialty, but within a general medical capacity, whilst providing care during acute health crises.","Schaffer, S.; O039,; Neill, P.; Thomas, M.

The differences that have emerged in all spheres of our lives also reveal themselves in the field of education and training. The gates to a brand-new digitization-focused era have opened for both instructors and students. Individuals who spend their time during the pandemic period at home are involved in the distance learning process and experience the education field on the digital world. At this juncture, education and training institutions have preferred implementing various applications. One of these most preferred applications is Teams, which is tailored for security-based teamwork and collaboration, providing audio- and video-based chat and communication opportunities. In this study, one of the quantitative research methods, the survey method, was used. Due to the pandemic, the survey was conducted over the Internet, via e-mail, and social media channels. The study population consisted of 519 students studying at Istanbul Medipol University Faculty of Communication. Due to the size of the population and the pandemic, students were selected through convenience sampling method. The aim of the study was to determine the relationship between the current satisfaction levels of the participants with using the app “Microsoft Teams” and the solution proposals to enhance the current level of satisfaction. Various hypotheses were tested within the scope of the study. Differences were particularly observed between the departments in which the students study and the medium they used most frequently to log into the Microsoft Teams application and the subheadings (customization, convenience of use, and possibility to select) that lead to student satisfaction. Differences were found between the departments that are particularly prone to online training and other departments that prefer online training (computers) to a lesser extent. Similarly, differences were also observed between users who use the Microsoft Teams app on a desktop or laptop computer and participants who logged into the application using a smartphone or tablet. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Gezmen, B.; Eken, I.",Contributions to Management Science,,476

It does so via a heuristic comparison between two molecular technologies that are central to the promotion of sexual health: the combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Drawing on ethnographic research conducted in two sexual health institutions in the western part of Switzerland, the article presents two main findings. First, it argues that bodies are constructed as being at low or high risk by sexual health professionals (based on health and lifestyle criteria). Second, it shows that access to either the COCP or PrEP is largely based on this former classification. The article also demonstrates that there are ambivalent situations in which sexual health professionals seek compromises between different risks, and pragmatically adapt their medical protocols.","Debergh, Marlyse",Health Sociol Rev,,476

This is because socio-technical aspects are frequently not considered during the design, development, and implementation, stages of such initiatives. In addition, there is little discussion in the literature about the role socio-technical factors play in user-centered design processes for mHealth. This research posits consideration of socio-technical factors is required as techno-centric approaches to mHealth design and user engagement, as well as those relying on existing universal frameworks for user-centered design, have proven to be ineffective with the result that most mHealth projects in the Global South fail to sustain. This research examines projects in Sierra Leone where semi-structured interviews were conducted with mHealth designers and developers in order to explore their attitudes towards user engagement in this case. Barriers and facilitators to user engagement were identified and classified as either technical or socio-technical. Findings from the study indicate that adoption of a techno-centric approach without consideration of socio-technical factors can negatively affect user's engagement. Based on these findings, we propose to develop a new design framework for more effective inclusion of user-engaging attributes in mHealth.","Ikwunne, Tochukwu; Hederman, Lucy; Wall, P.

In addition, we made a new attempt to calculate the reduced DosePM2.5 (g) at the bronchiolar (Br.) and alveolar-interstitial (AI) regions of the 10-year-old children after the city lockdown/self-reflection of each city. A comparison of the average PM2.5 of a month before and after the lockdown (Wuhan) and self-reflection (Daegu and Tokyo) clearly shows that the PM2.5 concentration was decreased by 29.9, 20.9, and 3.6% in Wuhan, Daegu and Tokyo, respectively. Wuhan, Daegu and Tokyo also recorded 53.2, 19.0, and 10.4% falls of NO2 concentration, respectively. Wuhan, which had the largest decrease of PM2.5 concentration due to COVID-19, also marked the largest reduced DosePM2.5 10-year-old children (g) (3660 g at Br. and 6222 g at AI), followed by Daegu (445 g at Br. and 1287 g at AI), and Tokyo (18 g at Br. and 52 g at AI), over two months after the city lockdown/self-reflection. Our results suggest that the city lockdown/self-reflection had the effect of lowering the concentration of PM2.5, resulting in an extension of the period it took to the acute allergic airway inflammation (AAI) for the 10-year-old children.","Ma, C.

LID - e0027,2020,"PURPOSE: The ItchyQoL is an itch-specific patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) assessing quality of life (QoL) in patients with chronic pruritus (CP). We aimed to assess and extend the psychometric properties of the ItchyQoL using classical test theory (CTT) and item response theory (IRT). METHODS: Item characteristic curves (ICCs) were analysed in order to see whether the response categories are functioning optimally. Confirmatory factor analyses were carried out on the ItchyQoL prior to and after rescoring of the response categories. We conducted a Rasch analysis on the ItchyQoL with revised response options and assessed the mean fit residuals as well as the assumptions of unidimensionality and local independence. RESULTS: Five hundred and fifty-one patients with CP from nine European countries completed the 22 items of the ItchyQoL. IRT analysis supported the revision of response options from five to three. This revision was supported by excellent structural validity using CTT. The overall fit to the Rasch model was adequate. Unidimensionality was supported by the ItchyQoL overall scale as well as by the single subscales, however local independence was violated in eight cases. CONCLUSION: We suggest a revision of the response categories of the ItchyQoL from a 5-point to a 3-point scale. Applying this revision, the ItchyQoL showed excellent structural validity according to CTT and IRT/Rasch. The calculation of an overall ItchyQoL sum score is allowed.","Gabes, M; Zeidler, C; Ständer, S; Chen, S C; Apfelbacher, C J",Br. j. dermatol,,476

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to explore the incidence, severity, mortality rate, clinical features, and risk factors of symptoms of COVID-19 in home-dwelling older people, and its association with type of residence, cognitive deterioration, and neurodegenerative diseases. METHODS: Data about symptoms of COVID-19 were collected through a telephone survey in the cohort of 913 older volunteers of the Vallecas Project, aged 75-90 years, most of them (902) home-dwelling, in Madrid, Spain. The association of demographic and anthropometric measures, genetic polymorphisms, comorbidities, life habits, type of residence, and frailty surrogates were explored as potential risk factors for the incidence, severity, and mortality of COVID-19 in the older population. FINDINGS: Sixty-two cases reported symptoms compatible with COVID-19; 6 of them had died, 4 in their home and 2 in the nursing home. Moderate/severe cases were significantly older and more frequently males. The APOE Îµ4 allele was associated with the presence of symptoms of COVID-19. Higher systolic blood pressure, more intense smoking habit, more alcohol intake, lower consumption of coffee and tea, and cognitive impairment were associated with disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: The estimated incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 in this older cohort of Madrid was 6.8%, with an overall mortality rate of 0.7% (18.2% in those living in a nursing home) and a fatality rate of 9.9%. Our exploratory study indicates that life habits, other clinical conditions and, the Îµ4 variant of the APOE gene are associated with the presence and clinical severity of coronavirus infection.","Del Ser, Teodoro; Fernández-Blázquez, Miguel A; Valentí, Meritxell; Zea-Sevilla, María Ascensión; Frades, Belén; Alfayate, Eva; Saiz, Laura; Calero, Olga; García-López, Fernando José; Rábano, Alberto; Medina, Miguel; Calero, Miguel",Gerontology,,476

The purpose of this study was to evaluate levels of multiple cytokines in blood plasma from the patients with COVID-19 during acute phase of the disease, and upon complete recovery. Samples of peripheral blood plasma of 56 patients with COVID-19, 69 convalescents and 10 healthy individuals were examined. Concentrations of 46 molecules, such as IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-9, IL-12 (p40), IL-12 (p70), IL-13, IL-15, IL-17A/CTLA8, IL-17-E/IL-25, IL-17F, IL-18, IL-22, IL-27, IFNα2, IFNγ, TNFα, TNFβ/ Lymphotoxin-α (LTA), CCL2/MCP-1, CCL3/MIP-1α, CCL4/MIP-1β, CCL7/MCP-3, CCL11/Eotaxin, CCL22/MDC, CXCL1/GROα, CXCL8/IL-8, CXCL9/MIG, CXCL10/IP-10, CX3CL1/Fractalkine, IL-1ra, IL-10, EGF, FGF-2/FGF-basic, Flt3 Ligand, G-CSF, M-CSF, GM-CSF, PDGF-AA, PDGF-AB/ BB, TGF-α, VEGF-A were measured via xMAP multiplexing technology. Significantly increased levels of 18 cytokines were found in blood plasma from COVID-19 patients during acute phase of the disease (as compared to control group), i.e., IL-6, IL-7, IL-15, IL-27, TNFα, TNFβ/Lymphotoxin-α (LTA), CCL2/MCP-1, CCL7/MCP-3, CXCL1/GROα, CXCL8/IL-8, CXCL10/IP-10, CXCL9/MIG, IL-1rа, IL-10, M-CSF, GM-CSF, VEGF-A. We found a significant decrease of nearly all the mentioned cytokines in recovered patients, in comparison with those who had moderate, severe/extremely severe disease. Moreover, we revealed a significantly decreased level of 8 cytokines in plasma from convalescents, as compared with control group, i.e., IL-1α, IL-2, IL-9, IL-12 p40, IL-18, CCL22/MDC, Flt3 Ligand, TGF-α. Immune response caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection involves multiple cytokines, mostly, with pro-inflammatory effects. We have shown for the first time that the convalescence phase is characterized by significantly lower levels of cytokines which regulate cellular differentiation and hematopoiesis (in particular, lymphocytes, T-cells and NK-cells). Over acute phase of the disease, the levels of these cytokines did not change. We revealed a significant decrease of most plasma cytokines upon recovery as compared to acute phase. On the contrary, acute phase of the disease is accompanied by significant increase of both pro- and antiinflammatory cytokines in blood plasma.","Arsentieva, N. A.; Liubimova, N. E.; Batsunov, O.

223155,The impact of self-leadership and organizational commitment on the performance of COVID-19 nurses,2021,"The 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic has triggered stay-at-home orders in 43 states since March 19, 2020. Evidence is limited on how these orders affect peoples' behaviors and mental distress. We used a nationally representative survey of 1094 American adults collected between March 19 and March 31, 2020 to compare risk-reduction behaviors and mental distress in states with and without orders. Risk reduction behaviors included hand washing, wearing face mask and social distancing, and the mental distress was assessed by the four-item version of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4). We predicted the probability of a person adopting risk reduction behaviors and the mental distress status using the number of days since their state issued the order relative to those in the non-order states, controlling for COVID-19 prevalence in the state, self-reported symptoms and demographic characteristics. The analysis was conducted in April 2020. Results show that the probability of adopting risk reduction behaviors increased between 8 (avoidance of people with high risk, 87% to 95%) and 27 (use of face mask, 18% to 45%) percentage points in the response period. Mental distress increased by 1.0 point on the PHQ-4 score (from 2.4 to 3.5 point) in the first week and started to drop afterwards. In summary, stay-at-home orders were associated with a differential increase in risk-reduction behaviors. People's mental distress rose in the first week under order and dropped afterwards. While in need for confirmation in longitudinal data, these results suggest that residents are responsive to orders.","Liu, Ying; Mattke, Soeren",Prev Med,,476
223181,Covid-19: The E484K mutation and the risks it poses,2021,"BACKGROUND: During the early phase of the Covid-19 pandemic, reductions of hospital admissions with a focus on emergencies have been observed for several medical and surgical conditions, while trend data during later stages of the pandemic are scarce. Consequently, this study aims to provide up-to-date hospitalization trends for several conditions including cardiovascular, psychiatry, oncology and surgery cases in both the in- and outpatient setting. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using claims data of 86 Helios hospitals in Germany, consecutive cases with an in- or outpatient hospital admission between March 13, 2020 (the begin of the ""protection"" stage of the German pandemic plan) and December 10, 2020 (end of study period) were analyzed and compared to a corresponding period covering the same weeks in 2019. Cause-specific hospitalizations were defined based on the primary discharge diagnosis according to International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) or German procedure classification codes for cardiovascular, oncology, psychiatry and surgery cases. Cumulative hospitalization deficit was computed as the difference between the expected and observed cumulative admission number for every week in the study period, expressed as a percentage of the cumulative expected number. The expected admission number was defined as the weekly average during the control period. A total of 1,493,915 hospital admissions (723,364 during the study and 770,551 during the control period) were included. At the end of the study period, total cumulative hospitalization deficit was -10% [95% confidence interval -10; -10] for cardiovascular and -9% [-10; -9] for surgical cases, higher than -4% [-4; -3] in psychiatry and 4% [4; 4] in oncology cases. The utilization of inpatient care and subsequent hospitalization deficit was similar in trend with some variation in magnitude between cardiovascular (-12% [-13; -12]), psychiatry (-18% [-19; -17]), oncology (-7% [-8; -7]) and surgery cases (-11% [-11; -11]). Similarly, cardiovascular and surgical outpatient cases had a deficit of -5% [-6; -5] and -3% [-4; -3], respectively. This was in contrast to psychiatry (2% [1; 2]) and oncology cases (21% [20; 21]) that had a surplus in the outpatient sector. While in-hospital mortality, was higher during the Covid-19 pandemic in cardiovascular (3.9 vs. 3.5%, OR 1.10 [95% CI 1.06-1.15], P<0.01) and in oncology cases (4.5 vs. 4.3%, OR 1.06 [95% CI 1.01-1.11], P<0.01), it was similar in surgical (0.9 vs. 0.8%, OR 1.06 [95% CI 1.00-1.13], P = 0.07) and in psychiatry cases (0.4 vs. 0.5%, OR 1.01 [95% CI 0.78-1.31], P<0.95). CONCLUSIONS: There have been varying changes in care pathways and in-hospital mortality in different disciplines during the Covid-19 pandemic in Germany. Despite all the inherent and well-known limitations of claims data use, this data may be used for health care surveillance as the pandemic continues worldwide. While this study provides an up-to-date analysis of utilization of hospital care in the largest German hospital network, short- and long-term consequences are unknown and deserve further studies.","Bollmann, Andreas; Hohenstein, Sven; Pellissier, Vincent; Stengler, Katharina; Reichardt, Peter; Ritz, Jörg-Peter; Thiele, Holger; Borger, Michael A; Hindricks, Gerhard; Meier-Hellmann, Andreas; Kuhlen, Ralf",PLoS One,,476

METHODS: Patients with cervical node-negative NPC treated with IMRT at the Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center between February 2001 and December 2008 were retrospectively reviewed. The failure patterns, prognostic factors, and efficacy of additional chemotherapy were assessed. RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 78 months for 298 patients. The 5-year local recurrence-free survival (LRFS), nodal recurrence-free survival (NRFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), failure-free survival (FFS), and overall survival (OS) were 95.2%, 99.3%, 94.8%, 89.8%, and 92.9%, respectively. The rate of treatment failure remained high in patients with T4 disease (35.4%, 17/48), including eight of local recurrence, two of nodal recurrence, and seven of distant metastasis. Multivariate analyses showed that the primary gross tumor volume (GTVp) was significantly associated with LRFS, DMFS, FFS, and OS. Subgroup analysis revealed that patients with GTVp &#8804; 42.5 cc had better 5-year LRFS (98.7% vs 81.4%, P < .001), 5-year DMFS (97.8% vs 82.5%, P < .001), 5-year FFS (96.1% vs 65.4%, P < .001), and 5-year OS (96.6% vs 78.2%, P < .001) than patients with GTVp > 42.5 cc. However, additional chemotherapy showed no significant survival benefit in stratification analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Cervical node-negative NPC has a good prognosis in the IMRT era, and the primary tumor volume is the most important prognostic factor. Further exploration is needed to determine the optimal treatment strategy for patients with a high tumor burden.","Wu, Zheng; Wang, Lei; Xie, De-Huan; Lv, Shao-Wen; Su, Yong; Shi, Ying-Rui",Asia Pac. j. clin.oncol,,476

224139,"[COVID-19 emergency management at the Nephrology and Dialysis Unit in Savona, Albenga and Cairo Montenotte]",2020,"BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease and acute exacerbations are also a part of the clinical course. The presence of the disease and relapses cause stress in people with MS (pwMS). For this reason, stress coping strategies of the patients are important in reducing perceived stress. Our aim in this study is to evaluate which strategies pwMS use during the COVID-19 pandemic, the effect of the strategies on perceived stress, their relationship with relapses and their role on quality of life (QoL). METHODS: An online form including Perceived Stress Scale (PSS; 10 items), Coping with Experienced Problems Scale (Brief-COPE; 28 items) and SF-12 were sent to 340 pwMS under our follow-up. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, we found that the patients used the strategies of turn to religion, planning and acceptance at a high rate. PSS score was high in 23 (11.2%) of the patients. The patients with low perceived stress used the acceptance strategy more (P=0.008). We found a negative correlation between physical component summary (PCS) of SF-12 and denial (r=-0.2, p<0.001) and distraction (r =-0.1, p=0.04). A negative correlation was found between mental component summary (MCS) of SF-12 and behavioral disconnection (r=-0.2, p=0.006). There was a positive correlation between MCS and humor (r=0.1, p=0.04), use of instrumental support (r=0.2, p=0.009), planning (r=0.1, p=0.04), and positive reframing (r=0.2, p=0.002). CONCLUSION: PwMS have been successful in coping with stress in the first half of the pandemic with the combination of emotional and problem-focused strategies. Acceptance strategy was highly adopted by patients with low PSS, and the tendency to use the active coping strategy together with the acceptance strategy was high in patients without relapses. Adoption to emotional strategies may have prevented the severe deterioration in QoL in this study group in the early period of Covid-19 pandemic.","Altunan, Bengu; Unal, Aysun; Bingöl, Ayhan; Dilek, Filiz; Girgin, Derya",Mult Scler Relat Disord,,476

Existing research has modeled the structure, style, content, and patterns in dissemination of online posts, as well as the demographic traits of users who interact with them. However, no attention has been directed towards modeling the properties of online communities that interact with the posts. In this work, we propose a novel social context-aware fake news detection framework, SAFER, based on graph neural networks (GNNs). The proposed framework aggregates information with respect to: 1) the nature of the content disseminated, 2) content-sharing behavior of users, and 3) the social network of those users. We furthermore perform a systematic comparison of several GNN models for this task and introduce novel methods based on relational and hyperbolic GNNs, which have not been previously used for user or community modeling within NLP. We empirically demonstrate that our framework yields significant improvements over existing text-based techniques and achieves state-of-the-art results on fake news datasets from two different domains.","Chandra, Shantanu; Mishra, Pushkar; Yannakoudakis, Helen; Nimishakavi, Madhav; Saeidi, Marzieh; Shutova, Ekaterina",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06274v2.pdf,476

METHODS: All patients referred to the emergency departments, RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection were evaluated. Demographic and clinical data were recorded. Two radiologists (8 and 15 years of experience) reviewed all the X-ray images and evaluated the following findings: interstitial opacities, alveolar opacities (AO), AO associated with consolidation, consolidation and/or pleural effusion. We stratified patients in groups according to the time interval between symptoms onset (cut-off 5 days) and X-ray imaging and according to age (cut-off 60 years old). Computed tomography was performed in case of a discrepancy between clinical symptoms, laboratory and X-ray findings, and/or suspicion of complications. RESULTS: A total of 468 patients were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Lung lesions primarily manifested as interstitial opacities (71.7%) and AO opacities (60.5%), more frequently bilateral (64.5%) and with a peripheral predominance (62.5%). Patients admitted to the emergency radiology department after 5 days from symptoms onset, more frequently had interstitial and AO opacities, in comparison to those admitted within 5 days, and lung lesions were more frequently bilateral and peripheral. Older patients more frequently presented interstitial and AO opacities in comparison to younger ones. Sixty-eight patients underwent CT that principally showed the presence of ground-glass opacities and consolidations. CONCLUSIONS: The most common X-ray pattern is multifocal and peripheral, associated with interstitial and alveolar opacities. Chest X-ray, compared to CT, can be considered a reliable diagnostic tool, especially in the Emergency setting.","Ippolito, Davide; Maino, Cesare; Pecorelli, Anna; Allegranza, Pietro; Cangiotti, Cecilia; Capodaglio, Carlo; Mariani, Ilaria; Giandola, Teresa; Gandola, Davide; Bianco, Ilaria; Ragusi, Maria; Franzesi, Cammillo Talei; Corso, Rocco; Sironi, Sandro",Respir Med,,476

However, due to low viral load in some COVID-19 patients, false negative results from this method have been repeatedly reported. METHOD: In this study, we compared the sensitivity and specificity of digital PCR (dPCR) in simulated samples and clinical samples with qPCR assay through a series of vigorous tests. RESULTS: The results showed that dPCR was more sensitive than qPCR especially for samples with low viral load (&#8804;3 copies). In addition, dPCR had similar specificity as qPCR and could effectively distinguish other human coronaviruses and influenza virus from SARS-CoV-2. More importantly, dPCR was more sensitive than qPCR in detecting the virus in the ""negative"" samples from recurrent COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, dPCR could serve as a powerful complement to the current qPCR method for SARS-CoV-2 detection, especially for the samples with extremely low viral load, such as recurrent COVID-19 patients.","Sun, Yong; Ding, Chengchao; Chen, Qingqing; Xie, Jiajia; Yu, Junling; Shi, Yonglin; Jiang, Chengcheng; Zhang, Zhuhui; He, Hongliang; Ge, Yinglu; Li, Wenting; He, Jun; Gao, Yong",J Virol Methods,,476

MethodsAn online survey was conducted among adults in Israel (n=461), immediately after the first COVID-19 vaccine became available (22/12/2020 to 10/1/2021). Two regressions were performed to investigate determinants of intention and sense of urgency to receive the available COVID-19 vaccine. ResultsAlthough many adults intended to receive available COVID-19 vaccine, only 65% intended to immediately receive the vaccine; 16% preferred to wait 3 months and 18% preferred to wait a year. The sense of urgency to get vaccinated differed by age, periphery-level, perceived barriers, cues to action and availability. Monetary rewards or the ""green pass"" incentives didnt increase the probability of getting vaccination immediately. ConclusionsProviding data on the role of incentives in increasing the intention to immediately receive the available COVID-19 vaccine is important for health policy makers and healthcare providers. Our findings underscore the importance of COVID-19 vaccine accessibility. Practice ImplicationsHealth policy makers should consider allocating funds for making the vaccine accessible and encourage methods of persuasion, instead of investing funds in monetary incentives.","Shmueli, Liora",,,476
225557,Influences on Attitudes Regarding Potential COVID-19 Vaccination in the United States,2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has changed how we view our consultations. To reduce the risk of spread in the most vulnerable patients (those with heart disease) and health personnel, most face-to-face consultations have been replaced by telemedicine consultations. Although this change has been rapidly introduced, it will most likely become a permanent feature of clinical practice. Nevertheless, there remain serious doubts about organizational and legal issues, as well as the possibilities for improvement etc. In this consensus document of the Spanish Society of Cardiology, we attempt to provide some keys to improve the quality of care in this new way of working, reviewing the most frequent heart diseases attended in the cardiology outpatient clinic and proposing some minimal conditions for this health care process. These heart diseases are ischemic heart disease, heart failure, and arrhythmias. In these 3 scenarios, we attempt to clarify the basic issues that must be checked during the telephone interview, describe the patients who should attend in person, and identify the criteria to refer patients for follow-up in primary care.

225612,Equitable allocation of COVID-19 vaccines in the United States,2021,"BACKGROUND: Pandemic planning has historically been oriented to respond to an influenza virus, with vaccination strategy being a key focus. As the current COVID-19 pandemic plays out, the Australian government is closely monitoring progress towards development of SARS-CoV2 vaccines as a definitive intervention. However, as in any pandemic, initial supply will likely be exceeded by demand due to limited manufacturing output. METHODS: We convened community juries in three Australian locations in 2019 to assess public acceptability and perceived legitimacy of influenza pandemic vaccination distribution strategies. Preparatory work included literature reviews on pandemic vaccine allocation strategies and on vaccine allocation ethics, and simulation modelling studies. We assumed vaccine would be provided to predefined priority groups. Jurors were then asked to recommend one of two strategies for distributing remaining early doses of vaccine: directly vaccinate people at higher risk of adverse outcomes from influenza; or indirectly protect the general population by vaccinating primary school students, who are most likely to spread infection. RESULTS: Thirty-four participants of diverse backgrounds and ages were recruited through random digit dialling and topic-blinded social media advertising. Juries heard evidence and arguments supporting different vaccine distribution strategies, and questioned expert presenters. All three community juries supported prioritising school children for influenza vaccination (aiming for indirect protection), one by 10-2 majority and two by consensus. Justifications included that indirect protection benefits more people and is likely to be more publicly acceptable. CONCLUSIONS: In the context of an influenza pandemic, informed citizens were not opposed to prioritising groups at higher risks of adverse outcomes, but if resources and epidemiological conditions allow, achieving population benefits should be a strategic priority. These insights may inform future SARS-CoV-2 vaccination strategies.","Degeling, C; Williams, J; Carter, S M; Moss, R; Massey, P; Gilbert, G L; Shih, P; Braunack-Mayer, A; Crooks, K; Brown, D; McVernon, J",Vaccine,,476
225695,Massage Therapy in the Time of COVID-19,2021,"In this work, a new compartmental mathematical model of COVID-19 pandemic has been proposed incorporating imperfect quarantine and disrespectful behavior of the citizens towards lockdown policies, which are evident in most of the developing countries. An integer derivative model has been proposed initially and then the formula for calculating basic reproductive number R 0 of the model has been presented. Cameroon has been considered as a representative for the developing countries and the epidemic threshold R 0 has been estimated to be â¯â¼â¯3.41 ( 95 % C I : 2.2 - 4.4 ) as of July 9, 2020. Using real data compiled by the Cameroonian government, model calibration has been performed through an optimization algorithm based on renowned trust-region-reflective (TRR) algorithm. Based on our projection results, the probable peak date is estimated to be on August 1, 2020 with approximately 1073 ( 95 % C I : 714 - 1654 ) daily confirmed cases. The tally of cumulative infected cases could reach â¯â¼â¯20, 100 ( 95 % C I : 17 , 343 - 24 , 584 ) cases by the end of August 2020. Later, global sensitivity analysis has been applied to quantify the most dominating model mechanisms that significantly affect the progression dynamics of COVID-19. Importantly, Caputo derivative concept has been performed to formulate a fractional model to gain a deeper insight into the probable peak dates and sizes in Cameroon. By showing the existence and uniqueness of solutions, a numerical scheme has been constructed using the Adams-Bashforth-Moulton method. Numerical simulations enlightened the fact that if the fractional order &#945; is close to unity, then the solutions will converge to the integer model solutions, and the decrease of the fractional-order parameter (0 â¯<â¯ &#945; â¯<â¯ 1) leads to the delaying of the epidemic peaks.","Nabi, Khondoker Nazmoon; Abboubakar, Hamadjam; Kumar, Pushpendra",Chaos Solitons Fractals,,476

But this topic still remains among the most relevant issues in complex network theory due to its range of applicability. The contact process (CP) and the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model are used quite often to describe epidemic dynamics. Despite their simplicity, these models are robust to predict the kernel of real situations. In this work, we review concisely both processes that are well-known and very applied examples of models that exhibit absorbing-state phase transitions. In the epidemic scenario, individuals can be infected or susceptible. A phase transition between a disease-free (absorbing) state and an active stationary phase (where a fraction of the population is infected) are separated by an epidemic threshold. For the SIS model, the central issue is to determine this epidemic threshold on heterogeneous networks. For the CP model, the main interest is to relate critical exponents with statistical properties of the network.","Mata, Ang'elica S.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.02360v1.pdf,476

226643,Understanding the reactions of government and gaming concessionaires on COVID-19 through the neo-institutional theory - The case of Macao,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the initial chest X-ray (CXR) severity assessed by an AI system may have prognostic utility in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This retrospective single-center study included adult patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) between February 25 and April 9, 2020, with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed on real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Initial CXRs obtained on ED presentation were evaluated by a deep learning artificial intelligence (AI) system and compared with the Radiographic Assessment of Lung Edema (RALE) score, calculated by two experienced radiologists. Death and critical COVID-19 (admission to intensive care unit (ICU) or deaths occurring before ICU admission) were identified as clinical outcomes. Independent predictors of adverse outcomes were evaluated by multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Six hundred ninety-seven 697 patients were included in the study: 465 males (66.7%), median age of 62 years (IQR 52-75). Multivariate analyses adjusting for demographics and comorbidities showed that an AI system-based score &#8805; 30 on the initial CXR was an independent predictor both for mortality (HR 2.60 (95% CI 1.69 - 3.99; p < 0.001)) and critical COVID-19 (HR 3.40 (95% CI 2.35-4.94; p < 0.001)). Other independent predictors were RALE score, older age, male sex, coronary artery disease, COPD, and neurodegenerative disease. CONCLUSION: AI- and radiologist-assessed disease severity scores on CXRs obtained on ED presentation were independent and comparable predictors of adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04318366 ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04318366 ). KEY POINTS: â¢ AI system-based score &#8805; 30 and a RALE score &#8805; 12 at CXRs performed at ED presentation are independent and comparable predictors of death and/or ICU admission in COVID-19 patients. â¢ Other independent predictors are older age, male sex, coronary artery disease, COPD, and neurodegenerative disease. â¢ The comparable performance of the AI system in relation to a radiologist-assessed score in predicting adverse outcomes may represent a game-changer in resource-constrained settings.","Mushtaq, Junaid; Pennella, Renato; Lavalle, Salvatore; Colarieti, Anna; Steidler, Stephanie; Martinenghi, Carlo M A; Palumbo, Diego; Esposito, Antonio; Rovere-Querini, Patrizia; Tresoldi, Moreno; Landoni, Giovanni; Ciceri, Fabio; Zangrillo, Alberto; De Cobelli, Francesco",Eur. radiol,,476

227685,COVID-19: looking to the future,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The world is currently experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic. The northern hemisphere awaits winter with foreboding, anticipating an amplification of the current second wave of COVID-19 concurrent with annual seasonal influenza. METHODS: This paper attempts to overview current seasonal COVID-19 trends. RESULTS: Cases are spiking now in winter in Australia and also in summer weather, such as in Florida. Clearly warm weather does not significantly dampen viral spread unless public health mitigation measures are adhered to. Respiratory pathogens (including influenza), will co-circulate in winter. Co-infection with influenza and COVID-19 may worsen outcomes and mutations of either virus may change and further negatively affect such outcomes. The public in Australia has avidly taken the influenza vaccine and this, along with COVID-19 prevention measures, has drastically curbed influenza spread in this country. CONCLUSIONS: Countries in the northern hemisphere with high rates of COVID-19 should strive to reduce numbers prior to the onset of winter. Those that managed to maintain low COVID-19 rates due to public health measures should endeavor to maintain this status quo despite opening borders for economically badly needed tourists. Spikes of cases in countries wherein COVID-19 was formerly under control will deter tourists, further depressing beleaguered economies. Vigilance must be maintained until an effective vaccine becomes available. The key is to have public health driven economy whereby opening of borders and activities organized are driven by evidence based public health advice. Influenza vaccination is highly recommended.","Grech, Victor; Cuschieri, Sarah; Gauci, Charmaine",Early Hum Dev,,476

227952,COVID-19 vaccines for children: The essential role of the pediatric nurse,2020,"BackgroundUp-to-date seroprevalence estimates are critical to describe the SARS-CoV-2 immune landscape in the population and guide public health measures. We aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies 15 months into the COVID-19 pandemic and six months into the vaccination campaign. MethodsWe conducted a population-based cross-sectional serosurvey between June 1 and July 7, 2021, recruiting participants from age- and sex-stratified random samples of the general population. We tested participants for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies targeting the spike (S) or nucleocapsid (N) proteins (Roche Elecsys immunoassays). We estimated the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies seroprevalence following vaccination and/or infection (anti-S antibodies), or infection only (anti-N antibodies). ResultsWe included 3355 individuals, of which 1814 (54.1%) were women, 697 (20.8%) were aged <18 years and 449 (13.4%) were aged [≥]65 years, 2161 (64.4%) tested positive for anti-S antibodies, and 906 (27.0%) tested positive for anti-N antibodies. The total seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 66.1% (95% credible interval, 64.1-68.0). We estimated that 29.9% (28.0-31.9) of the population developed antibodies after infection; the rest having developed antibodies only via vaccination. Seroprevalence estimates were similar across sexes, but differed markedly across age groups, being lowest among children aged 0-5 years (20.8% [15.5-26.7]) and highest among older adults aged [≥]75 years (93.1% [89.6-96.0]). Seroprevalence of antibodies developed via infection and/or vaccination was higher among participants with a higher educational level. ConclusionsMost adults have developed anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, while most teenagers and children remain vulnerable to infection. As the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant spreads and vaccination rates stagnate, efforts are needed to address vaccine hesitancy, particularly among younger individuals and socioeconomically disadvantaged groups, and to minimize spread among children.","Stringhini, Silvia; Zaballa, María-Eugenia; Pullen, Nick; Perez-Saez, Javier; Mestral, Carlos de; Loizeau, Andrea; Lamour, Julien; Pennacchio, Francesco; Wisniak, Ania; Dumont, Roxane; Baysson, Hélène; Richard, Viviane; Lorthe, Elsa; Semaani, Claire; Balavoine, Jean-François; Pittet, Didier; Vuilleumier, Nicolas; Chappuis, François; Kherad, Omar; Azman, Andrew S; Posfay-Barbe, Klara; Kaiser, Laurent; Guessous, Idris; Group, - the Specchio-COVID19 Study",,,476

228313,JUE Insight: College Student Travel Contributed to Local COVID-19 Spread,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory distress coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), is a rapidly evolving pandemic challenging the world and posing unprecedented public health issues. Current data show that COVID-19 is associated with increased disease severity in individuals with obesity. Obesity is usually associated with dysregulated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAAS) axis. RAAS has also been implicated in acute lung injury as well as myocardial injury and has thus attracted interest as a potential regulator of COVID-19 severity. Whilst research all over the world is still struggling to provide a detailed characterization of the biology of SARS-CoV2 and its associated disease profile, it has become evident that SARS-CoV2 uses the membrane-bound form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor for cell internalization. ACE2 is a protective component of the RAAS axis and is downregulated after SARS-CoV2 infection. The RAAS axis could thus be a link between obesity and COVID-19 severity; therefore, more accurate understanding of the underlying mechanisms would be needed with the hope of proposing efficient therapeutic interventions.","Akoumianakis, Ioannis; Filippatos, Theodosios",Obes Rev,,476
228771,"A Comprehensive Review of Coronavirus Disease 2019: Epidemiology, Transmission, Risk Factors, and International Responses",2021,"COVID-19 is an ongoing worldwide infectious disease pandemic. The purpose of this study was to investigate post-traumatic stress and related factors among hospital nurses during the COVID-19 outbreak. The subjects of this study were 300 nurses who worked in three general hospitals that operated National Designated Isolation Unit (NDIU) wards during the COVID-19 outbreak. Self-reporting questionnaires were used to collect data on post-traumatic stress, general characteristics, and work-related information. The average post-traumatic stress score was 20.68 ± 19.5 points and 36.7% of participants were at high risk of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The odds ratio (OR) for PTSD was higher for nurses who worked in the NDIU ward (OR = 16.31, 95% CI = 3.79-70.32), who responded that nurse staffing was poor (OR = 3.03, 95% CI = 1.01-9.10), and who responded that they experienced COVID-19 symptoms (OR = 3.83, 95% CI = 1.89-7.75). Total 36.7% of nurses were at risk of PTSD and the factors related to PTSD were the work department, nurse staffing, and experiencing COVID-19 symptoms. These results could be used to manage PTSD and provide psychological support of nurses during infectious disease epidemics, such as COVID-19.","Moon, Da-Jeong; Han, Mi Ah; Park, Jong; Ryu, So Yeon",Psychiatr. q,,476
228924,"Employment Tax Incentives to Promote Recovery from the COVID-19 Recession: Policy Options [June 25, 2020]",2020,"Objective: The digitalization of the healthcare system poses new challenges for physicians. Thus, the relevance of learning digital competencies (DiCo), such as dealing with data sets, apply telemedicine or using apps, is already growing in medical education. DiCo should be clearly separated from digitized teaching formats, which have been increasingly used since the COVID 19 pandemic. This article outlines the faculties in Germany where DiCo are already integrated into medical education. Methods: Courses with DiCo as teaching content were collected by a literature research on Pubmed and Google as well as by contacting all dean's offices and other persons responsible for teaching at German medical faculties. The courses were summarized in a table. Results: In a first survey, 16 universities were identified that offer courses on DiCo. In the elective area at the universities, 17 courses and in the compulsory area eight courses could be identified. The scope and content of the courses diverged between compulsory curricula, integrated courses of different lengths, and elective courses that are one-time or longitudinally integrated. The topics taught are heterogeneous and include fundamentals of medical informatics such as data management on the one hand and a collection of e.g. ethics, law, apps, artificial intelligence, telemedicine and robotics on the other hand. Conclusion: Currently, only some German medical faculties offer courses on DiCo. These courses vary in scope and design. They are frequently part of the elective curriculum and only reach some of the students. The possibility of embedding DiCo in the already existing cross-sectional area appears limited. In view of the ongoing digitalization of healthcare, it is necessary to make future courses on DiCo accessible to all medical students. In order to drive this expansion forward, the implementation of the new learning objectives catalogue, in which DiCo are integrated, a network formation, a teaching qualification as well as the involvement of students is recommended.","Aulenkamp, Jana; Mikuteit, Marie; Löffler, Tobais; Schmidt, Jeremy",GMS J Med Educ,,476
228986,Setting up a Research Poster During COVID-19 Lockdown: A Reflection,2020,"Since the start of the global spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, cancer patients were identified as a specifically susceptible subgroup of the patient population Several reports have shown that cancer patients have an increased risk of both contracting the infection and of experiencing a more severe disease course, with a rapidly evolving picture associated with higher mortality The assumption of cancer patients as “COVID-19 vulnerable” has led, irretrievably, to profound changes in the decision making of oncological treatments Potential justifications for such concerns encompass the cancer-dependent suppression of the immune response, as well as the influence of administration of systemic anticancer treatments, including chemotherapy and immunotherapy Nevertheless, to date, it is not clear whether the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in cancer patients is safe, given their modulating effects on the immune system, or that they may rather conceal detrimental consequences Theoretically, on the one hand, ICIs may enhance the immunological control of viral infections through their immunostimulating mechanisms;on the other hand, they could contribute to the hyper-inflammatory phase of COVID-19, worsening its clinical outcomes In this study, we report the foremost clinical observations on the safety of ICI administration in cancer patients affected by COVID-19","Burgaletto, Chiara Brunetti Oronzo Munafò Antonio Bernardini Renato Silvestris Nicola Cantarella Giuseppina Argentiero Antonella",Cancers,,476

In total, 30 rice grains were sampled around Agbaou and Bonikro gold mines. Arsenic and cadmium concentrations were determined using an inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES), while atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) was used for mercury. Results showed that As and Hg average concentrations in rice were above the permissible limits, while Cd average concentrations were below the permissible limit established by FAO/WHO in both sites. Except for Hg at Agbaou, no significant (p < 0.05) difference was found between trace metal concentrations in the two sites. The average daily intake (ADI) of As via rice consumption exceeded the USEPA reference dose (RfD) of 0.0003 µg g-1 day-1, indicating that rice ingestion is a pathway of As exposure for adults and children in the area. The average values of non-carcinogen (HQ) for As and carcinogen (CR) for As and Cd risks index suggest that potential health risks exist for both adults and children due to rice consumption at Agbaou and Bonikro. The maximum safe weekly consumption (MSWC) of rice relative to As, Cd, and Hg was estimated for the study area. Overall, this study provides strong evidence that As could threaten local population health in Côte d'Ivoire regions where gold mine extraction is occurring through rice ingestion.","Kinimo, Kakou Charles; Yao, Koffi Marcellin; Marcotte, Stéphane; Kouassi, N039; Berenger, Guessan Louis; Trokourey, Albert",,,476

229763,No Choice but to Be Essential: Expanding Dimensions of Precarity During COVID-19,2021,"Identifying actual risk zones in a country where the overall test positive rate (TPR) is higher than 5% is crucial to contain the pandemic. However, TPR-based risk zoning methods are debatable since they do not consider the rate of infection in an area and thus, it has been observed to overestimate the risk. Similarly, the rate of infection in an area has been noticed to underestimate the risk of COVID-19 spreading for the zones with higher TPR. In this article, we discuss the shortcomings of currently available risk zoning methods that are followed in the lower-middle-income countries (LMIC), especially in Bangladesh. We then propose to determine a risk zone by combining the rate of infection with TPR and effective reproduction number, Rt in a distinct manner from existing methods. We evaluate the efficacy of the proposed method with respect to the mass-movement events and show its application to track the evolution of COVID-19 pandemic by identifying the risk zones over time.

Due to limited availability of test kits, the need for auxiliary diagnostic approach has increased. Recent research has shown radiography of COVID-19 patient, such as CT and X-ray, contains salient information about the COVID-19 virus and could be used as an alternative diagnosis method. Chest X-ray (CXR) due to its faster imaging time, wide availability, low cost and portability gains much attention and becomes very promising. Computational methods with high accuracy and robustness are required for rapid triaging of patients and aiding radiologist in the interpretation of the collected data. In this study, we design a novel multi-feature convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for multi-class improved classification of COVID-19 from CXR images. CXR images are enhanced using a local phase-based image enhancement method. The enhanced images, together with the original CXR data, are used as an input to our proposed CNN architecture. Using ablation studies, we show the effectiveness of the enhanced images in improving the diagnostic accuracy. We provide quantitative evaluation on two datasets and qualitative results for visual inspection. Quantitative evaluation is performed on data consisting of 8,851 normal (healthy), 6,045 pneumonia, and 3,323 Covid-19 CXR scans.

Though models predict that complexity arises via convergent inputs from neurons with diverse response properties, in most vertebrate systems, convergence has only been inferred rather than tested directly. Here, we measure sensory computations in zebrafish vestibular neurons across multiple axes in vivo. We establish that whole-cell physiological recordings reveal tuning of individual vestibular afferent inputs and their postsynaptic targets. Strong, sparse synaptic inputs can be distinguished by their amplitudes, permitting analysis of afferent convergence in vivo. An independent approach, serial-section electron microscopy, supports the inferred connectivity. We find that afferents with similar or differing preferred directions converge on central vestibular neurons, conferring more simple or complex tuning, respectively. Together, these results provide a direct, quantifiable demonstration of feedforward input convergence in vivo.","Liu, Zhikai; Kimura, Yukiko; Higashijima, Shin-Ichi; Hildebrand, David G C; Morgan, Joshua L; Bagnall, Martha W",,,476

Gaining insight into factors regarding willingness or refusal for vaccination might guide our goals in raising the awareness and target efforts to increase acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine and maximize the uptake. Therefore, this study aims to assess the intent to receive the COVID-19 vaccine among Lebanese adults and the factors associated with vaccine refusal. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study during November-December 2020 among Lebanese adults from all Lebanese regions using a survey tool with closed-ended questions that included sociodemographic data and questions about vaccine hesitancy, knowledge, attitude, practice, and fear of COVID-19. We used the snowball technique to collect the data because of the COVID-19 imposed lockdown. RESULTS: Of the 579 participants, 21.4% were willing to receive the vaccine, 40.9% refused, and the remainder were unsure of their response. More vaccine hesitancy (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.06; 95% CI 1.03-1.09) was significantly associated with more odds of disagreeing/ strongly disagreeing on receiving the COVID-19 vaccine compared to being neutral. More vaccine hesitancy (aOR = 0.95; 95% CI 0.91-0.99), female gender compared to males (aOR = 0.53; 95% CI 0.32-0.87), and being married compared to single (aOR = 0.53; 95% CI 0.29-0.98) were significantly associated with lower odds of agreeing/strongly agreeing on receiving the COVID-19 vaccine compared to being neutral. CONCLUSION: Overall, our findings revealed a high percentage of people (40%) who strongly disagreed with receiving the vaccine, mainly females, married participants, and those who have a general vaccine hesitancy. Moreover, no significant association was found with knowledge, attitude, or prevention practice regarding COVID-19. Targeted efforts are necessary to increase acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine among the Lebanese population to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Further studies with a larger sample size are warranted to validate our results and provide better insights into the underlying reasons for refusing vaccination.","Kasrine Al Halabi, Carina; Obeid, Sahar; Sacre, Hala; Akel, Marwan; Hallit, Rabih; Salameh, Pascale; Hallit, Souheil",BMC Public Health,,476

By September 2020, little guidance had been provided to school districts to inform fall teaching. This indecision led to a variety of teaching postures within a given state. In this report we examine Ohio school districts in-depth, to address whether on-premises teaching impacted COVID-19 disease outcomes in that community. We observed that counties with on-premises teaching had more cumulative deaths at the end of fall semester than counties with predominantly online teaching. To provide a measure of disease progression, we developed an observational disease model and examined multiple possible confounders, such as population size, mobility, and demographics. Examination of micropolitan counties revealed that the progression of COVID-19 disease was faster during the fall semester in counties with predominantly on-premises teaching. The relationship between increased disease prevalence in counties with on-premises teaching was not related to deaths at the start of the fall semester, population size, or the mobility within that county. This research addresses the critical question whether on-premises schooling can impact the spread of epidemic and pandemic viruses and will help inform future public policy decisions on school openings.","Ehman, Cheyenne; Luo, Yixuan; Yang, Zi; Zhu, Ziyan; Donovan, Sara; Avery, Annika J.; Wang, Jiayi; Lawler, James; Nugent, Rebecca; Ventura, Valerie; Lakdawala, Seema S",,,476

The participants consisted of eighteen middle school teachers from different subject areas in Turkey. A maximum variation sampling method was employed for participant selection. The data was collected through semi-structured interviews. Due to the pandemic, the interviews were conducted using video conferencing applications. The data was analyzed through content analysis. According to the findings, the teachers report that while they are effective in achieving cognitive objectives, they have difficulties in achieving affective and psychomotor objectives. In addition, the teachers do not prefer to design their own materials, rather they mainly benefit from ready-to-use materials during emergency distance education. The teachers also reveal that direct instruction and questioning were the teaching methods and techniques they preferred in online courses and that they were unable to adapt other methods and techniques to distance education, which resulted in students experiencing teacher-centered activities. Moreover, the teachers complain about students not attending the online courses on time or even at all, their disinterest, a lack of instant feedback, limited communication with students, and insufficient course lengths. Another critical finding was that the teachers only use homework, end-of-unit quizzes, and participation to online courses as measurement and evaluation tools and agree that they are unable to administer reliable and valid evaluation tools. The limitations of the study and implications for future research are later discussed.","Aslan, Seda Akti; Turgut, Yigit Emrah; Aslan, Alper",Educ Inf Technol (Dordr),,476

Its consequences can range from impaired mental health to issues of technology addiction. A conformant countermovement has popularised digital detoxing, a practice that endorses to deliberately limit technology use to reduce digital involvement and physiological stress. In times of social isolation, however, digital networking may provide the principle access to social interactions. To provide empirical evidence about the sweet spot between mitigating digital overuse and perceived social connectedness, this paper proposes a mixed-methods design to scrutinise the impact of digital detox measures in a professional context. Possible results will help to better understand how digital overuse may effectively be mitigated by remote workers and what measures organisations can take to create a digital environment that supports employee satisfaction and mental health.","Mirbabaie, Milad; Marx, Julian; Braun, Lea-Marie; Stieglitz, Stefan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.09535v1.pdf,476

233629,The COVID Pandemic and Surgical Innovation in the United States,2021,"Purpose: Since the eye is in close proximity to the oro-nasal cavity, transmission of SARS CoV-2 is higher during ophthalmic surgical procedures, it is vital to ensure the safety of the healthcare team by pre-operative Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) and real-time Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS CoV-2 viral RNA of all patients planned for elective or emergency surgery. Hence, understanding the profile of pre-operative RAT and real-time RT-PCR among patients planned for various ophthalmic procedures, will help us make better decisions for future guidelines, for optimal planning of ophthalmic elective or emergency surgeries, keeping in mind the current scenario. Methods: This is a prospective descriptive study conducted on patients planned for elective or emergency ophthalmic surgeries, who had no COVID-19-related symptoms pre-operatively and were subjected to preoperative RAT and real-time RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal and throat swabs for SARS CoV-2 viral RNA. Data was compiled and statistically analysed. Results: 204 patients underwent pre-operative RAT and RT-PCR testing; of which, 85 were females and 119 were males. Mean age of the study population was 51.44 ± 16.501 years. Among the 204, 2 tested positive for SARS CoV-2 with Rapid Antigen testing as well as RT-PCR and 10 patients tested positive via RT-PCR after a negative RAT result of the same sample. Conclusion: Pre-operative testing for COVID-19 disease is indispensable as there is a high chance of transmission from patient to healthcare workers. RAT has the advantage of quick results and may play a role in case of emergency procedures. However, it is prudent to perform the more sensitive real-time RT-PCR before any elective, non-emergency procedures or surgeries to avoid any undue risk to the healthcare team.","Kumar, K Kiran; Sampritha, U C; Maganty, Vandana; Prakash, Akshata A; Basumatary, Jessica; Adappa, Karishma; Chandraprabha, S; Neeraja, T G; Guru Prasad, N S; Preethi, B; Gangasagara, Suresh Babu; Sujatha Rathod, B L",Indian J Ophthalmol,,476

Many sectors of the economy from food to healthcare have been competing for workers, as a consequence. In this paper, we construct a supply chain game theory network framework that captures labor constraints under three different scenarios. The appropriate equilibrium constructs are defined, along with their variational inequality formulations. Computed solutions to numerical examples inspired by shortages of migrant labor to harvest fresh produce; specifically, blueberries, in the United States, reveal the impacts of a spectrum of disruptions to labor on the product flows and the profits of the firms in the supply chain network economy.

Common medications such as aspirin, that mitigate these pathways, may decrease COVID-19 mortality. This retrospective assessment was designed to quantify the correlation between pre-diagnosis aspirin and mortality for COVID-19 positive patients in our care. Data from the Veterans Health Administration national electronic health record database was utilized for the evaluation. Veterans from across the country with a first positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction lab result were included in the evaluation which comprised 35,370 patients from March 2, 2020 to September 13, 2020 for the 14-day mortality cohort and 32,836 patients from March 2, 2020 to August 28, 2020 for the 30-day mortality cohort. Patients were matched via propensity scores and the odds of mortality were then compared. Among COVID-19 positive Veterans, preexisting aspirin prescription was associated with a statistically and clinically significant decrease in overall mortality at 14-days (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.32-0.46) and at 30-days (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.33-0.45), cutting the odds of mortality by more than half. Findings demonstrated that pre-diagnosis aspirin prescription was strongly associated with decreased mortality rates for Veterans diagnosed with COVID-19. Prospective evaluation is required to more completely assess this correlation and its implications for patient care.","Osborne, T. F.; Veigulis, Z. P.; Arreola, D. M.; Mahajan, S.

At the same time, a second longstanding pandemic has been brought to the fore: the entrenched system of racial injustice and oppression. The first pandemic is new and to date substantial resources have been allocated to urgently addressing its mitigation; the second has a long history with inconsistent attention and resources but has recently been spotlighted more intensely than at any time in the nation's recent past. The authors of this article contend that these 2 simultaneous pandemics have brought forth the need for institutions in the United States to make a renewed commitment to respect, wellness, diversity, and inclusion. While investment and leadership in these domains have always been essential, these have largely been viewed as a ""nice-to-have"" option. The events of much of 2020 (most notably) have illustrated that committing to and investing in policies, programs, centers, and leadership to drive change in these domains are essential and a ""need-to-have"" measure. The authors outline the necessity of investing in the promotion of cultures of inclusive excellence at both individual and organizational levels to coordinate a united response to the simultaneous pandemics. It is in the interests of health care systems to consider the wellness of the workforce to overcome the longer term economic, systemic, and social trauma that will likely occur for years to come at both the individual and institutional levels. Maintaining or augmenting investment is necessary despite the economic challenges the nation faces. Now is the time to cultivate resilience and wellness through a renewed commitment to cultures of respect, diversity, and inclusion.

This was a serial three-round cross-sectional, community-based study where participants were selected from the residents of Bhubaneswar city using multi-stage random sampling. Blood samples were collected during household visits along with demographic and clinical data from every participant. Total anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody present in serum was assessed using the electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay platform. Temporal comparisons of the community seroprevalence were performed against the detected number of cumulative cases, active cases, recoveries and deaths. A total of 3693 participants were enrolled in this study with a cumulative non-response rate of 18.33% in all the three rounds. The gender-weighted seroprevalence for the city in the first round was 1.55% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84-2.58), second round was 5.27% (95% CI 4.13-6.59) and in the third round was 49.04% (95% CI 46.39-51.68). In the first round, the seroprevalence was found to be highest in the elderly population, whereas the seroprevalence for the second and third phases was highest in the age group of 30-39 years. Seroprevalence showed an increasing trend over the three time periods, with the highest seropositivity rates among individuals sampled between 16 and 18 September 2020.

In the bioinformatics area, one of the crucial points is the analysis of the virus nucleotide sequences using approaches such as data stream techniques and algorithms. However, to make feasible this approach, it is necessary to transform the nucleotide sequences string to numerical stream representation. Thus, the dataset provides four kinds of data stream representation (DSR) of SARS-CoV-2 virus nucleotide sequences. The dataset provides the DSR of 1557 instances of SARS-CoV-2 virus, 11540 other instances of other viruses from the Virus-Host DB dataset, and three instances of Riboviria viruses from NCBI (Betacoronavirus RaTG13, bat-SL-CoVZC45, and bat-SL-CoVZXC21).","Barbosa, Raquel de M.; Fernandes, Marcelo A.C.",Data Brief,,476
236660,The Logical Case for Love as an Ingredient in Policy Formulation After COVID-19,2020,"We report the discovery of KMT-2020-BLG-0414Lb, with a planet-to-host mass ratio $q_2 = 0.9$--$1.2 \times 10^{-5} = 3$--$4~q_{\oplus}$ at $1\sigma$, which is the lowest mass-ratio microlensing planet to date. Together with two other recent discoveries ($4 \lesssim q/q_\oplus \lesssim 6$), it fills out the previous empty sector at the bottom of the triangular $(\log s, \log q)$ diagram, where $s$ is the planet-host separation in units of the angular Einstein radius $\theta_{\rm E}$. Hence, these discoveries call into question the existence, or at least the strength, of the break in the mass-ratio function that was previously suggested to account for the paucity of very low-$q$ planets. Due to the extreme magnification of the event, $A_{\rm max}\sim 1450$ for the underlying single-lens event, its light curve revealed a second companion with $q_3 \sim 0.05$ and $|\log s_3| \sim 1$, i.e., a factor $\sim 10$ closer to or farther from the host in projection. The measurements of the microlens parallax $\pi_{\rm E}$ and the angular Einstein radius $\theta_{\rm E}$ allow estimates of the host, planet, and second companion masses, $(M_1, M_2, M_3) \sim (0.3M_{\odot}, 1.0M_{\oplus}, 17M_{J})$, the planet and second companion projected separations, $(a_{\perp,2}, a_{\perp,3}) \sim (1.5, 0.15~{\rm or}~15)$~au, and system distance $D_{\rm L} \sim 1$ kpc. The lens could account for most or all of the blended light ($I \sim 19.3$) and so can be studied immediately with high-resolution photometric and spectroscopic observations that can further clarify the nature of the system.

237028,COVID-19: A decision-making approach for prioritization of preventive activities,2020,"Since the onset of the global pandemic in early 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has posed a multitude of challenges to health care systems worldwide. In order to combat these challenges and devise appropriate therapeutic strategies, it becomes of paramount importance to elucidate the pathophysiology of this illness. Coronavirus disease 2019, caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), is characterized by a dysregulated immune system and hypercoagulability. COVID-associated coagulopathy (CAC) was recognized based on profound d-dimer elevations and evidence of microthrombi and macrothrombi, both in venous and arterial systems. The underlying mechanisms associated with CAC have been suggested, but not clearly defined. The model of immunothrombosis illustrates the elaborate crosstalk between the innate immune system and coagulation. The rendering of a procoagulant state in COVID-19 involves the interplay of many innate immune pathways. The SARS-CoV2 virus can directly infect immune and endothelial cells, leading to endothelial injury and dysregulation of the immune system. Activated leukocytes potentiate a procoagulant state via release of intravascular tissue factor, platelet activation, NETosis, and inhibition of anticoagulant mechanisms. Additional pathways of specific relevance in CAC include cytokine release and complement activation. All these mechanisms have recently been reported in COVID-19. Immunothrombosis provides a comprehensive perspective of the several synergistic pathways pertinent to the pathogenesis of CAC.","Jayarangaiah, Apoorva; Kariyanna, Pramod Theetha; Chen, Xiaoyi; Jayarangaiah, Amog; Kumar, Abhishek",Clin Appl Thromb Hemost,,476

In the present study, we investigated potential role of combined specimen collection technique for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection where five nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from different individuals and pooled together in a single viral transport medium (VTM). MATERIAL AND METHODS: This pilot study was conducted on different cohorts of Delhi state. Two nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from each enrolled individual. One swab was put into VTM vial to be further used for individual swab testing (ID). The other swab was put into a fresh VTM for pool swab collection. Each pool comprised five swabs collected from five different patients in one VTM vial. Both IDs and pools were tested in parallel for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 using real time PCR. RESULTS: A total of 46 pools were collected from 230 enrolled individuals.Among 230 ID tested, 60 were found to be positive for both E and RdRp gene. Among 46 pools, 25 pools included all negatives samples and remaining 21 pools included one or more positives. Comparing ID with pool results, overall concordance was seen in 42 pools (91.3%). Four pools showed false positive results as all included samples on ID testing were found to be negative. Considering ID results as reference, swab pool showed 100% sensitivity, 84% specificity, 84% positive predictive value and 100% negative predictive value. CONCLUSION: The pooling of swab strategy could be beneficial only among asymptomatic in low prevalence areas.","Agarwal, Reshu; Gupta, Ekta; Dubey, Shantanu; Padhi, Abhishek; Khodare, Arvind; Kumar, Guresh; Sarin, Shiv Kumar",Indian j. med. microbiol,,476
237348,A Preliminary Investigation of the Views of People With Parkinson's (With and Without Psychosis) and Caregivers on Participating in Clinical Trials During the Covid-19 Pandemic: An Online Survey,2020,"Integration of digital technologies and public health (or digital healthcare) helps us to fight the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which is the biggest public health crisis humanity has faced since the 1918 Influenza Pandemic. In order to better understand the digital healthcare, this work conducted a systematic and comprehensive review of digital healthcare, with the purpose of helping us combat the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper covers the background information and research overview of digital healthcare, summarizes its applications and challenges in the COVID-19 pandemic, and finally puts forward the prospects of digital healthcare. First, main concepts, key development processes, and common application scenarios of integrating digital technologies and digital healthcare were offered in the part of background information. Second, the bibliometric techniques were used to analyze the research output, geographic distribution, discipline distribution, collaboration network, and hot topics of digital healthcare before and after COVID-19 pandemic. We found that the COVID-19 pandemic has greatly accelerated research on the integration of digital technologies and healthcare. Third, application cases of China, EU and U.S using digital technologies to fight the COVID-19 pandemic were collected and analyzed. Among these digital technologies, big data, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, 5G are most effective weapons to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Applications cases show that these technologies play an irreplaceable role in controlling the spread of the COVID-19. By comparing the application cases in these three regions, we contend that the key to China's success in avoiding the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic is to integrate digital technologies and public health on a large scale without hesitation. Fourth, the application challenges of digital technologies in the public health field are summarized. These challenges mainly come from four aspects: data delays, data fragmentation, privacy security, and data security vulnerabilities. Finally, this study provides the future application prospects of digital healthcare. In addition, we also provide policy recommendations for other countries that use digital technology to combat COVID-19.","Wang, Qiang; Su, Min; Zhang, Min; Li, Rongrong",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,476

237524,COVID-19 and the solidification of media’s power in football,2020,"Diabetes is a worldwide public health concern as it is associated with various complications. One of the major complications of diabetes is diabetic foot syndrome that results in catastrophic events such as ulceration and amputation. Therefore, the main four strategies of diabetic foot care involve risk prediction, prevention, and early diagnosis and prompt intervention. The drivers of ulceration are multifactorial, and importantly, include microcirculatory changes in the diabetic skin. Cutaneous microcirculation on the foot is greatly influenced by the small fibers which mediate thermal sensation and pain perception in addition to sympathetic activities such as thermoregulation and vasodilation. The interdependence between the neurovascular elements means with the loss of small fiber functions, the corresponding microcirculatory responses may be compromised. Thus, it can be hypothesized that the impairment of the microcirculation may follow the order of the corresponding small fiber nerve dysfunction or vice versa. In this review, select neurovascular investigations that inform the cutaneous microcirculatory and small fiber nerve function in response to pain, cold, and heat and pressure stimuli are reviewed and discussed in this order of sensory loss: the loss of pain, cold, warmth, touch and deep pressure sensation. We also discuss the neurological and vascular characteristics of each of these neurovascular responses. This review highlights the influence of small fibers on cutaneous microcirculation and the need for prospective studies that can determine the course of microcirculatory impairment over time. This, in turn, may help clarify the exact role of microcirculatory changes in the pathway of ulceration. The insights from this review can be pertinent to understand key microcirculatory disturbances and given that the microcirculatory impairment develops at an early stage, relevant interventions can be implemented to possibly reverse or regress the course of the disease. Therefore, knowledge of the neurovascular interactions aids to map the disease progression for early diagnosis and prevention of adverse complications.","Balasubramanian, Gayathri; Vas, Prashanth; Chockalingam, Nachiappan; Naemi, Roozbeh",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),,476

METHODS: We screened 12,778 participants at high risk of type 2 diabetes using a fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c). People with screen-detected type 2 diabetes were randomised in a parallel, three-arm, controlled trial with up to 46 months of follow-up, with a control arm (CON), a group-based lifestyle intervention of 6 core and up to 15 maintenance sessions (INT), or the same intervention with additional support from volunteers with type 2 diabetes trained to co-deliver the lifestyle intervention (INT-DPM). The pre-specified primary end point was mean HbA1c compared between groups at 12 months. RESULTS: We randomised 432 participants (CON 149; INT 142; INT-DPM 141) with a mean (SD) age of 63.5 (10.0) years, body mass index (BMI) of 32.4 (6.4) kg/m2, and HbA1c of 52.5 (10.2) mmol/mol. The primary outcome of mean HbA1c at 12 months (CON 48.5 (9.1) mmol/mol, INT 46.5 (8.1) mmol/mol, and INT-DPM 45.6 (6.0) mmol/mol) was significantly lower in the INT-DPM arm compared to CON (adjusted difference -2.57 mmol/mol; 95% CI -4.5, -0.6; p = 0.007) but not significantly different between the INT-DPM and INT arms (-0.55 mmol/mol; 95% CI -2.46, 1.35; p = 0.57), or INT vs CON arms (-2.14 mmol/mol; 95% CI -4.33, 0.05; p = 0.07). Subgroup analyses showed the intervention had greater effect in participants < 65 years old (difference in mean HbA1c compared to CON -4.76 mmol/mol; 95% CI -7.75, -1.78 mmol/mol) than in older participants (-0.46 mmol/mol; 95% CI -2.67, 1.75; interaction p = 0.02). This effect was most significant in the INT-DPM arm (-6.01 mmol/mol; 95% CI -9.56, -2.46 age < 65 years old and -0.22 mmol/mol; 95% CI -2.7, 2.25; aged > 65 years old; p = 0.007). The use of oral hypoglycaemic medication was associated with a significantly lower mean HbA1c but only within the INT-DPM arm compared to CON (-7.0 mmol/mol; 95% CI -11.5, -2.5; p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: The NDPS lifestyle intervention significantly improved glycaemic control after 12 months in people with screen-detected type 2 diabetes when supported by trained peer mentors with type 2 diabetes, particularly those receiving oral hypoglycaemics and those under 65 years old. The effect size was modest, however, and not sustained at 24 months. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN34805606 .

238621,Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin as a treatment of COVID-19: results of an open-label non-randomized clinical trial,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is considered a systemic disease. A severe course with fatal outcome is possible and unpredictable. OBJECTIVES: Which organ systems are predominantly involved? Which diseases are predisposed for a fatal course? Which organ changes are found with lethal outcome? MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from published autopsy studies (28 cases by our group) with respect to organ changes and possible cause of death. RESULTS: The most severe alterations are found in the lungs by diffuse alveolar damage as a symptom of an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), in part with fibrosis. Thrombosis of small- to mid-sized pulmonary arteries is associated with hemorrhagic lung infarction. Frequent complications are bacterial pneumonias and less frequently fungal pneumonias by aspergillus. Pulmonary thromboembolism is found in 20-30% of lethal courses, also in the absence of deep venous thrombosis. Intestinal involvement of COVID-19 can be associated with intestinal ischemia, caused by shock or local thrombosis. In most cases, the kidneys display acute tubular injury reflecting acute renal failure, depletion of lymphocytes in the lymph nodes and spleen, and hyperplastic adrenal glands. The liver frequently reveals steatosis, liver cell necrosis, portal inflammation, and proliferation of Kupffer cells. Important preexisting diseases in autopsy studies are arterial hypertension with hypertensive and ischemic cardiomyopathy and diabetes mellitus but large population-based studies reveal increased risk of mortality only for diabetes mellitus not for arterial hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: Alterations of the pulmonary circulation with pulmonary arterial thrombosis, infarction, and bacterial pneumonia are important and often lethal complications of COVID-19-associated ARDS. Findings from autopsy studies have influenced therapy and prophylaxis.","Lax, Sigurd F; Skok, Kristijan; Zechner, Peter M; Setaffy, Lisa; Kessler, Harald H; Kaufmann, Norbert; Vander, Klaus; Cokic, Natalija; Maierhofer, Ursa; Bargfrieder, Ute; Trauner, Michael",Pathologe,,476
238632,Mitigating the Burden of Hypertension in Developing Nations and the Global Impact of Covid-19 Vaccine,2021,"BACKGROUND: Asymptomatic or subclinical SARS-CoV-2 infections are often unreported, which means that confirmed case counts may not accurately reflect underlying epidemic dynamics. Understanding the level of ascertainment (the ratio of confirmed symptomatic cases to the true number of symptomatic individuals) and undetected epidemic progression is crucial to informing COVID-19 response planning, including the introduction and relaxation of control measures. Estimating case ascertainment over time allows for accurate estimates of specific outcomes such as seroprevalence, which is essential for planning control measures. METHODS: Using reported data on COVID-19 cases and fatalities globally, we estimated the proportion of symptomatic cases (i.e. any person with any of fever &#8805; 37.5 °C, cough, shortness of breath, sudden onset of anosmia, ageusia or dysgeusia illness) that were reported in 210 countries and territories, given those countries had experienced more than ten deaths. We used published estimates of the baseline case fatality ratio (CFR), which was adjusted for delays and under-ascertainment, then calculated the ratio of this baseline CFR to an estimated local delay-adjusted CFR to estimate the level of under-ascertainment in a particular location. We then fit a Bayesian Gaussian process model to estimate the temporal pattern of under-ascertainment. RESULTS: Based on reported cases and deaths, we estimated that, during March 2020, the median percentage of symptomatic cases detected across the 84 countries which experienced more than ten deaths ranged from 2.4% (Bangladesh) to 100% (Chile). Across the ten countries with the highest number of total confirmed cases as of 6 July 2020, we estimated that the peak number of symptomatic cases ranged from 1.4 times (Chile) to 18 times (France) larger than reported. Comparing our model with national and regional seroprevalence data where available, we find that our estimates are consistent with observed values. Finally, we estimated seroprevalence for each country. As of 7 June, our seroprevalence estimates range from 0% (many countries) to 13% (95% CrI 5.6-24%) (Belgium). CONCLUSIONS: We found substantial under-ascertainment of symptomatic cases, particularly at the peak of the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, in many countries. Reported case counts will therefore likely underestimate the rate of outbreak growth initially and underestimate the decline in the later stages of an epidemic. Although there was considerable under-reporting in many locations, our estimates were consistent with emerging serological data, suggesting that the proportion of each country's population infected with SARS-CoV-2 worldwide is generally low.","Russell, Timothy W; Golding, Nick; Hellewell, Joel; Abbott, Sam; Wright, Lawrence; Pearson, Carl A B; van Zandvoort, Kevin; Jarvis, Christopher I; Gibbs, Hamish; Liu, Yang; Eggo, Rosalind M; Edmunds, W John; Kucharski, Adam J",BMC Med,,476

Given the panoply of potential COVID-19 diagnostic tools and therapeutic candidates that require purified spike protein and its importance for ongoing SARS-CoV-2 research, we have explored new approaches for spike production and purification. Three transient gene expression methods based on PEI-mediated transfection of CHO or HEK293 cells in suspension culture in chemically-defined media were compared for rapid production of full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain. A high-cell-density protocol using DXB11-derived CHOBRI/55E1 cells gave substantially better yields than the other methods. Different forms of the spike ectodomain were expressed, including the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 sequence and a mutated form (to favor expression of the full-length spike ectodomain stabilized in pre-fusion conformation), with and without fusion to putative trimerization domains. An efficient two-step affinity purification method was also developed. Ultimately, we have been able to produce highly homogenous preparations of full-length spike, both monomeric and trimeric, with yields of 100-150 mg/L in the harvested medium. The speed and productivity of this method support further development of CHO-based approaches for recombinant spike protein manufacturing.","Stuible, Matthew; Gervais, Christian; Lord-Dufour, Simon; Perret, Sylvie; L039,; Abbé, Denis; Schrag, Joseph; St-Laurent, Gilles; Durocher, Yves",J. biotechnol,,476

METHODS: An online self-reported survey was conducted in a tertiary hospital. Respondents were asked to report their perceived threat, perceived risk of infection, evaluation of hospital response, demographics, and job-related factors. Descriptive statistics and multivariate regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: A total of 441 employees participated in this study. Of respondents, 60% were willing to accept their work during an infectious disease outbreak and 12.5% were unwilling to accept the work. In addition, 8% of respondents reported that they had considered quitting their job, 54.4% reported their job was dangerous, and 50.1% of respondents perceived the severity of COVID-19 as high. Perceived threat and effectiveness of hospital response were associated with hospital employees' intention to work. CONCLUSIONS: Hospital workers are at the front line of the COVID-19 outbreak. This study highlighted hospital workers' perceived effectiveness of organizational response to the outbreak, and perceived threats were found to be important factors for whether they continue to work or not in the fight against the outbreak.","Jang, Yeonhoon; You, Myoungsoon; Lee, Su Young; Lee, Wang Jun",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,476

239663,Finally good NEWS: Something simple is working in COVID-19!,2021,"Objectives: The Council of Residency Directors (CORD) in Emergency Medicine (EM) has recommended that all residency programs should conduct virtual interviews for the 2020 to 2021 application cycle due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While factors such as geographical region, city, program size, or hospital affiliation are not modifiable, EM residencies can bridge the information gap created by a lack of face-to-face interaction by representing themselves digitally. Measuring usability provides an objective method for EM residencies to improve their Web presence and effectively represent themselves to applicants. Methods: Our sample set included 55 U.S. EM residency program websites. Using methodology replicated from previous literature on health care website usability, we divided usability into four categories for quantifiable analysis: accessibility, marketing, content quality, and technology. Analysis was performed on each website and scored in all four categories. A “general usability” score was calculated for each website using a composite of the key factors within the four categories. Using a weighted percentage across all of the factors, an overall score was calculated. Results: Content quality was the overall highest scoring category (mean ± SD = 5.4, SE = 0.33). The overall lowest performing category was technology (mean ± SD = 0.8 ± 0.09, SE = 0.01). Conclusions: Measuring usability can help EM residency programs identify ways to improve their Web presence. To effectively promote their programs, residencies need quality content that communicates their key features. Our recommendation is for all residency programs to periodically perform website audits and apply the usability measures outlined to improve their digital presence, especially during times when face-to-face interactions will be limited. © 2021 by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine","Fundingsland, E.; Fike, J.; Calvano, J.; Raja, A.; Lai, D.; Silacci, S.; Haas, M.; Chan, T.; He, S.",AEM Education and Training,,476

The aim of this study was to review the case reports that have described oral manifestations in patients suffering for this syndrome. A systematic review of case reports was performed on PubMed and Science Direct on January 2020 among all the articles dealing with the disease. In vitro, preclinical, and clinical studies have not been included to select only the case reports. Eighteen articles, published between 1999 and 2019, were included. All the patients presented mandibular osteomyelitis or sclerosis, associated with various other symptoms such as trismus, temporomandibular joint arthritis, or dysphagia. The data highlight the high variability in the disease's manifestations between people and also in the treatments applied. Knowing the orofacial signs of the SAPHO syndrome, the dental surgeon has a crucial role in the diagnosis procedure and must take place in the multidisciplinary medical team involved in the patient following. Some care adaptations are needed for oral interventions in these patients, depending on their treatments and their handicap.Key Pointsâ¢ Orofacial manifestations of SAPHO syndrome mainly occur on the mandible.â¢ In cases of mandible sclerosis, decorticalization surgeries may be performed.â¢ Oral care are encouraged, especially the preventive treatments to limit the necessity of surgeries.â¢ The complexity in the management of patients suffering for a SAPHO syndrome concerns the oral manifestations, the patient general health and the treatments he has to take every day.","Ferreira-Vilaca, Clémence; Costa Mendes, Leonor; Campana, Sophie-Caroline; Bailleul-Forestier, Isabelle; Audouin-Pajot, Christine; Esclassan, Rémi; Canceill, Thibault",Clin. rheumatol,,476
239903,First Quarter Chronicle of COVID-19: An Attempt to Measure Governments’ Responses,2020,"BACKGROUND: The role of children in household transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains uncertain. Here, we describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of children with COVID-19 in Catalonia (Spain) and investigate the dynamics of household transmission. METHODS: Prospective, observational, multicenter study performed during summer and school periods (1 July-31 October, 2020), in which epidemiological and clinical features, and viral transmission dynamics were analyzed in COVID-19 patients <16 years. A pediatric index case was established when a child was the first individual infected within a household. Secondary cases were defined when another household member tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 before the child. The secondary attack rate (SAR) was calculated, and logistic regression was used to assess associations between transmission risk factors and SARS-CoV-2 infections. RESULTS: The study included 1040 COVID-19 patients <16 years. Almost half (47.2%) were asymptomatic, 10.8% had comorbidities, and 2.6% required hospitalization. No deaths were reported. Viral transmission was common among household members (62.3%). More than 70% (756/1040) of pediatric cases were secondary to an adult, whereas 7.7% (80/1040) were index cases. The SAR was significantly lower in households with COVID-19 pediatric index cases during the school period relative to summer (p=0.02), and when compared to adults (p=0.006). No individual or environmental risk factors associated with the SAR were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Children are unlikely to cause household COVID-19 clusters or be major drivers of the pandemic even if attending school. Interventions aimed at children are expected to have a small impact on reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","Soriano-Arandes, Antoni; Gatell, Anna; Serrano, Pepe; Biosca, Mireia; Campillo, Ferran; Capdevila, Ramon; Fàbrega, Anna; Lobato, Zulema; López, Núria; Moreno, Ana Mª; Poblet, Miriam; Riera-Bosch, Maria Teresa; Rius, Neus; Ruiz, Montserrat; Sánchez, Almudena; Valldepérez, Cinta; Vilà, Mònica; Pineda, Valentí; Lazcano, Uxue; Díaz, Yesika; Reyes-Urueña, Juliana; Soler-Palacín, Pere",Clin. infect. dis,,476

In some countries, governments have underwritten a proportion of the wage income for staff forced to furlough or broadened their welfare systems to accommodate newly laid off workers or small business owners. While these actions are helpful, they do not explicitly address the lack of sales trading activity on business income and cash balances. In commentary, we identify what types of businesses have been increasing their cash holdings in the lead up to COVID-19 as an indication of what types of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are most at risk if the lockdown extends for a protracted period of time. We find that only 39% of the of businesses were bolstering their cash balances leading up to COVID-19 which suggests that 61% of businesses may run out of cash, including 8.6% that had no retained earnings whatsoever with micro firms at particular risk.

Given that COVID-19 disproportionately impacts LGBTQ+ populations, we investigate how working conditions and healthcare bias may expose LGBTQ+ farmers - essential employees - to high risk of transmitting the virus. During COVID-19, LGBTQ+ farmers may experience worse mental health outcomes as they face occupational and identity-based stressors. Conversely, LGBTQ+ farmers may also demonstrate mental health resilience during COVID-19 due to pre-existing socially distant networks they created in light of agricultural heterosexism. What is unique about COVID-19 is that healthcare inequities of a relatively small percentage of the agriculture workforce has amplifying implications for the entire agrifood system. We call for research on LGBTQ+ farmers to understand how sexuality impacts agricultural health, to uncover health risks and protective factors that may increase the health of farming communities, and to support essential food production during a pandemic.","Wypler, Jaclyn; Hoffelmeyer, M",J Agromedicine,,476

In addition to the medical practice for treatment and immunization, it is vital to have a thorough understanding of community spread phenomena as related research reports 17.9-30.8% confirmed cases to remain asymptomatic. Therefore, an effective assessment strategy is vital to maximize tested population in a short amount of time. This article proposes an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven mobilization strategy for mobile assessment agents for epidemics/pandemics. To this end, a self-organizing feature map (SOFM) is trained by using data acquired from past mobile crowdsensing (MCS) campaigns to model mobility patterns of individuals in multiple districts of a city so to maximize the assessed population with minimum agents in the shortest possible time. Through simulation results for a real street map on a mobile crowdsensing simulator and considering the worst case analysis, it is shown that on the 15th day following the first confirmed case in the city under the risk of community spread, AI-enabled mobilization of assessment centers can reduce the unassessed population size down to one fourth of the unassessed population under the case when assessment agents are randomly deployed over the entire city.","Simsek, Murat; Kantarci, Burak",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,476

It has an estimated incidence of 1 case per 10,000 in the general population, and has a relation female-male of 1.5:1, without racial predilection. Usually, the diagnosis is incidental. We report the case of a 77-year-old male, with smoking history of 5 packages-year, suspended 30 years ago;exposure to welding for 20 years. Chronic sinusitis diagnosed in 1993. He presents in the emergency department with a clinical history of 10 days of evolution with rhinorrhea, non-productive cough, dyspnea, fever, myalgias, arthralgias and malaise. 6 days later he presented dyspnea at rest, and partial oxygen saturation of 30%, so they brought the patient to the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases (INER). In the simple chest tomography, we detected dextrocardia without cardiomegaly;liver in left situation, stomach in right situation. In lung parenchyma diffuse, bilateral areas of glass pattern;middle lobe is observed in the left hemithorax and lingual in the right thorax. Cylindrical bronchiectasis predominantly in both lower lobes. No relevant laboratory results were showed besides high inflammation markers. Microbiological tests reported a positive result in protein chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2. He was admitted for advanced airway management;his clinical evolution was torpid, and 3 days after his admission, he suffered a heart attack unresponsive to cardiopulmonary resuscitation maneuvers and death. Despite the fact that the majority of patients with situs inversus totalis have a relatively healthy life, one case in 20,000-40,000 individuals is related to Kartagener syndrome, which is a subset of a larger group of ciliary motility disorders called primary ciliary dyskinesias;it involves situs inversus totalis, chronic sinusitis and bronchiectasis. The patient we are reporting presented situs inversus totalis and cylindrical bronchiectasis on his admission tomography and a verbal diagnosis of chronic sinusitis, but due to his critical condition in which he arrived to the hospital and the COVID protocol in our institution we weren't able to perform an adequate approach and therefore corresponding treatment. Patient presented with a severe case of COVID-19 with no known background to put him at an increased risk of acute respiratory distress, and in retrospective we agreed that the bronchiectasis and the high probability of presenting with a ciliary motility disorder became his most important risk factor.","Alonso Zúñiga, R.; Menchaca Dávila, S.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,,476

Several machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) approaches have been developed for systematic identification of drug repurposing leads based on big data resources, hence further accelerating and de-risking the drug development process by computational means. Areas covered: The authors focus on supervised ML and AI methods that make use of publicly available databases and information resources. While most of the example applications are in the field of anticancer drug therapies, the methods and resources reviewed are widely applicable also to other indications including COVID-19 treatment. A particular emphasis is placed on the use of comprehensive target activity profiles that enable a systematic repurposing process by extending the target profile of drugs to include potent off-targets with therapeutic potential for a new indication. Expert opinion: The scarcity of clinical patient data and the current focus on genetic aberrations as primary drug targets may limit the performance of anticancer drug repurposing approaches that rely solely on genomics-based information. Functional testing of cancer patient cells exposed to a large number of targeted therapies and their combinations provides an additional source of repurposing information for tissue-aware AI approaches.","Tanoli, Ziaurrehman; Vähä-Koskela, Markus; Aittokallio, Tero",Expert Opin Drug Discov,,476

The purpose of our analysis is to show how travellers may introduce COVID-19 into the Pacific islands and discuss the role robust health systems play in protecting health and reducing transmission risk. We analyse travel and Global Health Security Index data using a scoring tool to produce quantitative estimates of COVID-19 importation risk, by departing and arriving country. Our analysis indicates that, as of 12 March 2020, the highest risk air routes by which COVID-19 may be imported into the Pacific islands are from east Asian countries (specifically, China, Korea and Japan) to north Pacific airports (likely Guam, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands or, to a less extent, Palau); or from China, Japan, Singapore, the United States of America or France to south Pacific ports (likely, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, French Polynesia or New Caledonia). Other importation routes include from other east Asian countries to Guam, and from Australia, New Zealand and other European countries to the south Pacific.

Our study included 56 patients who were died due to COVID-19 as the study group, and 245 patients who were hospitalized and recovered as the control group. The laboratory data of the patients were evaluated from the first blood tests (pre) taken from the first moment of admission to the hospital and the blood tests taken from before the patient's discharge or exitus (post) were evaluated retrospectively. The mean age of the nonsurvivor group was 62.0 ± 15.7 and the mean age of the control group was 54.34 ± 13.03. Age and length of stay are significantly higher in the nonsurvivor group. When comparing the pre- and postvalues of ferritin, according to the two groups separately, there was no significant difference in the control group and a high level of significance was observed in the nonsurvivor group (p < .01). COVID-19 disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 causes high mortality with widespread inflammation and cytokine storm. Ferritin is a cheap and widespread available marker, ferritin, which can be used for its predictivity of the mortality and hope it would be a useful marker for clinicians for the management of the disease.","Tural Onur, Seda; Altin, Sedat; Sokucu, Sinem Nedime; Fikri, Burcu Ileri; Barça, Tugçe; Bolat, Erkut; Toptas, Mehmet",J Med Virol,,476

METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and CNKI were searched up to March 12, 2020. We included studies providing information regarding diagnostic test accuracy of chest CT for COVID-19 detection. The methodological quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool. Sensitivity and specificity were pooled. RESULTS: Sixteen studies (n = 3186 patients) were included. The risks of bias in all studies were moderate in general. Pooled sensitivity was 92% (95% CI = 86-96%), and two studies reported specificity (25% [95% CI = 22-30%] and 33% [95% CI = 23-44%], respectively). There was substantial heterogeneity according to Cochran's Q test (p < 0.01) and Higgins I2 heterogeneity index (96% for sensitivity). After dividing the studies into two groups based on the study site, we found that the sensitivity of chest CT was great in Wuhan (the most affected city by the epidemic) and the sensitivity values were very close to each other (97%, 96%, and 99%, respectively). In the regions other than Wuhan, the sensitivity varied from 61 to 98%. CONCLUSION: Chest CT offers the great sensitivity for detecting COVID-19, especially in a region with severe epidemic situation. However, the specificity is low. In the context of emergency disease control, chest CT provides a fast, convenient, and effective method to early recognize suspicious cases and might contribute to confine epidemic. KEY POINTS: â¢ Chest CT has a high sensitivity for detecting COVID-19, especially in a region with severe epidemic, which is helpful to early recognize suspicious cases and might contribute to confine epidemic.","Xu, Buyun; Xing, Yangbo; Peng, Jiahao; Zheng, Zhaohai; Tang, Weiliang; Sun, Yong; Xu, Chao; Peng, Fang",Eur Radiol,,476

To date, there are no proven options for prophylaxis for those who have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2, nor therapy for those who develop COVID-19. Immune (i.e., ""convalescent"") plasma refers to plasma that is collected from individuals following resolution of infection and development of antibodies. Passive antibody administration through transfusion of convalescent plasma may offer the only short-term strategy for conferring immediate immunity to susceptible individuals. There are numerous examples in which convalescent plasma has been used successfully as postexposure prophylaxis and/or treatment of infectious diseases, including other outbreaks of coronaviruses (e.g., SARS-1, Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS]). Convalescent plasma has also been used in the COVID-19 pandemic; limited data from China suggest clinical benefit, including radiological resolution, reduction in viral loads, and improved survival. Globally, blood centers have robust infrastructure for undertaking collections and constructing inventories of convalescent plasma to meet the growing demand. Nonetheless, there are nuanced challenges, both regulatory and logistical, spanning donor eligibility, donor recruitment, collections, and transfusion itself. Data from rigorously controlled clinical trials of convalescent plasma are also few, underscoring the need to evaluate its use objectively for a range of indications (e.g., prevention vs. treatment) and patient populations (e.g., age, comorbid disease). We provide an overview of convalescent plasma, including evidence of benefit, regulatory considerations, logistical work flow, and proposed clinical trials, as scale-up is brought underway to mobilize this critical resource.","Bloch, Evan M; Shoham, Shmuel; Casadevall, Arturo; Sachais, Bruce S; Shaz, Beth; Winters, Jeffrey L; van Buskirk, Camille; Grossman, Brenda J; Joyner, Michael; Henderson, Jeffrey P; Pekosz, Andrew; Lau, Bryan; Wesolowski, Amy; Katz, Louis; Shan, Hua; Auwaerter, Paul G; Thomas, David; Sullivan, David J; Paneth, Nigel; Gehrie, Eric; Spitalnik, Steven; Hod, Eldad A; Pollack, Lewis; Nicholson, Wayne T; Pirofski, Liise-Anne; Bailey, Jeffrey A; Tobian, Aaron Ar",J Clin Invest,,476

The proper understanding of the three-dimensional structures that compose the virus, as well as of those involved in the infection process and in treatments, is expected to contribute to the advance of fundamental and applied research against this pandemic, including basic molecular biology studies and drug design. Virtual reality (VR) is a powerful technology to visualize the biomolecular structures that are currently being identified for SARS-CoV-2 infection, opening possibilities to significant advances in the understanding of the disease-associate mechanisms and thus to boost new therapies and treatments. The present availability of VR for a large variety of practical applications together with the increasingly easiness, quality and economic access of this technology is transforming the way we interact with digital information. Here, we review the software implementations currently available for VR visualization of SARS-CoV-2 molecular structures, covering a range of virtual environments: CAVEs, desktop software, and cell phone applications, all of them combined with head-mounted devices like cardboards, Oculus Rift or the HTC Vive.

Although some of the studies were conducted in Bangladesh, none of these studies considered the geographical distribution of knowledge and preventive behaviors towards COVID-19. Therefore, the present nationwide cross-sectional study with 10,067 samples for the first-time aims to assess the knowledge gap by presenting the geographical distribution of the COVID-19 knowledge and preventive behaviors across all administrative districts of Bangladesh. The measures included socio-demographics and questions about knowledge and preventive behaviors related to COVID-19. One-way ANOVA, independent t-test, and multiple linear regression were used to analyze the data. In addition, GIS-based mapping identified district-wise distribution of the outcomes. Results indicated that the overall mean score of knowledge related to COVID-19 was 14.363 ± 3.073, whereas 16.95 ± 2.89 was for preventive behaviors. Participants' being male, being divorced or widowed, consuming alcohol, smoking cigarettes, living in villages, and having no formal education reported lower performing preventive COVID-19 behaviors. Those participants with higher knowledge scores reported higher preventive COVID-19 behaviors (ß = 0.053, p<0.001). However, the model predicted only 13.2% of the variation in preventive COVID-19 behaviors while the overall model being significant. The findings suggest that the Bangladeshi government should initiate appropriate far-reaching program of health education focusing on knowledge and preventive behaviors towards COVID-19 at a community level. After all, the strategies to combat COVID-19 will require individuals' involvement to control and prevent the disease outbreak, for which education is essential.","Hosen, Ismail; Pakpour, Amir H; Sakib, Najmuj; Hussain, Nur; Al Mamun, Firoj; Mamun, Mohammed A",PLoS One,,476
246602,Geospatial analysis of misinformation in COVID-19 related tweets,2021,"The outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020 has led to a surge in the interest in the mathematical modeling of infectious diseases. Disease transmission may be modeled as compartmental models, in which the population under study is divided into compartments and has assumptions about the nature and time rate of transfer from one compartment to another. Usually, they are composed of a system of ordinary differential equations in time. A class of such models considers the Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered, and Deceased populations, the SEIRD model. However, these models do not always account for the movement of individuals from one region to another. In this work, we extend the formulation of SEIRD compartmental models to diffusion-reaction systems of partial differential equations to capture the continuous spatio-temporal dynamics of COVID-19. Since the virus spread is not only through diffusion, we introduce a source term to the equation system, representing exposed people who return from travel. We also add the possibility of anisotropic non-homogeneous diffusion. We implement the whole model in libMesh, an open finite element library that provides a framework for multiphysics, considering adaptive mesh refinement and coarsening. Therefore, the model can represent several spatial scales, adapting the resolution to the disease dynamics. We verify our model with standard SEIRD models and show several examples highlighting the present model's new capabilities.","Grave, Malú; Coutinho, Alvaro L G A",Comput Mech,,476

The objective of this study is to predict T2D risk using full-information continuous analysis of nationally sampled data from white and black American adults age &#8805;45 years. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A sample of 12,043 black (33%) and white individuals from a population-based cohort, REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) (enrolled 2003-2007), was observed through 2013-2016. The mean participant age was 63.12 ± 8.62 years, and 43.7% were male. Mean BMI was 28.55 ± 5.61 kg/m2. Risk factors for T2D regularly recorded in the primary care setting were used to evaluate future T2D risk using Bayesian logistic regression. External validation was performed using 9,710 participants (19% black) from Atherosclerotic Risk in Communities (ARIC) (enrolled 1987-1989), observed through 1996-1998. The mean participant age in this cohort was 53.86 ± 5.65 years, and 44.6% were male. Mean BMI was 27.15 ± 4.92 kg/m2. Predictive performance was assessed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the curve (AUC) statistics. The primary outcome was incident T2D. By 2016 in REGARDS, there were 1,602 incident cases of T2D. Risk factors used to predict T2D progression included age, sex, race, BMI, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein, blood pressure, and blood glucose. The Bayesian logistic model (AUC = 0.79) outperformed the Framingham risk score (AUC = 0.76), the American Diabetes Association risk score (AUC = 0.64), and a cardiometabolic disease system (using Adult Treatment Panel III criteria) (AUC = 0.75). Validation in ARIC was robust (AUC = 0.85). Main limitations include the limited generalizability of the REGARDS sample to black and white, older Americans, and no time to diagnosis for T2D. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that a Bayesian logistic model using full-information continuous predictors has high predictive discrimination, and can be used to quantify race- and sex-specific T2D risk, providing a new, powerful predictive tool. This tool can be used for T2D prevention efforts including weight loss therapy by allowing clinicians to target high-risk individuals in a manner that could be used to optimize outcomes.","Wilkinson, Lua; Yi, Nengjun; Mehta, Tapan; Judd, Suzanne; Garvey, W Timothy",PLoS Med,,476

A growing volume of evidence demonstrates close associations between periodontal pathogens including Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) and Treponema denticola (T. denticola) and AD. However, the effect and mechanisms of T. denticola on accumulation of Aß remain to be unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that T. denticola was able to enter the brain and act directly on nerve cells resulting in intra- and extracellular Aß1-40 and Aß1-42 accumulation in the hippocampus of C57BL/6 mice by selectively activating both ß-secretase and Î³-secretase. Furthermore, both KMI1303, an inhibitor of ß-secretase, as well as DAPT, an inhibitor of Î³- secretase, were found to be able to inhibit the effect of T. denticola on Aß accumulation in N2a neuronal cells. Overall, it is concluded that T. denticola increases the expression of Aß1-42 and Aß1-40 by its regulation on beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme-1 and presenilin 1.","Su, Xinyi; Tang, Zhiqun; Lu, Zhiyue; Liu, Yuqiu; He, Wanzhi; Jiang, Jiapei; Zhang, Yifan; Wu, Hongkun",J. mol. neurosci,,476

249571,Stay updated on recent advances in clinical dentistry during COVID-19 pandemic and beyond,2021,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread globally and can cause a shortage of medical resources, in particular, mechanical ventilators. High-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (HFNC) and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) are frequently used for acute respiratory failure patients as alternatives to invasive mechanical ventilation. They are drawing attention because of a potential role to save mechanical ventilators. However, their effectiveness and risk of viral spread are unclear. The latest network meta-analysis of pre-COVID-19 trials reported that treatment with non-invasive oxygenation strategies was associated with improved survival when compared with conventional oxygen therapy. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a lot of clinical research on COVID-19 related acute respiratory failure has been reported. Several observational studies and small trials have suggested HFNC or NPPV as an alternative of standard oxygen therapy to manage COVID-19 related acute respiratory failure, provided that appropriate infection prevention is applied by health care workers to avoid risks of the virus transmission. Awake proning is an emerging strategy to optimise the management of patients with COVID-19 acute respiratory failure. However, the benefits of awake proning have yet to be assessed in properly designed clinical research. Although HFNC and NPPV are probably effective for acute respiratory failure, the safety data are mostly based on observational and experimental reports. As such, they should be implemented carefully if adequate personal protective equipment and negative pressure rooms are available.","Ogawa, Kenta; Asano, Kengo; Ikeda, Junpei; Fujii, Tomoko",Anaesth Crit Care Pain Med,,476
250055,COVID-19 and the teacher's voice: self-perception and contributions of speech therapy to voice and communication during the pandemic,2021,"Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a challenge for medical staff, especially in the COVID-19 period. The COVID-19 disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is highly infectious, thus requiring additional measures during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Since CPR is a highly aerosol-generating procedure, it carries a substantial risk of viral transmission. We hypothesized that patients with diagnosed or suspected COVID-19 might have worse outcomes following OHCA outcomes compared to non-COVID-19 patients. To raise awareness of this potential problem, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that reported OHCA in the pandemic period, comparing COVID-19 suspected or diagnosed patients vs. COVID-19 not suspected or diagnosed group. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge (SHD). Secondary outcomes were the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), survival to hospital admission or survival with favorable neurological outcomes. Data including 4210 patients included in five studies were analyzed. SHD in COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients were 0.5% and 2.6%, respectively (odds ratio, OR = 0.25; 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.12, 0.53; p < 0.001). Bystander CPR rate was comparable in the COVID-19 vs. not COVID-19 group (OR = 0.88; 95% CI: 0.63, 1.22; p = 0.43). Shockable rhythms were observed in 5.7% in COVID-19 patients compared with 37.4% in the non-COVID-19 group (OR = 0.19; 95% CI: 0.04, 0.96; p = 0.04; I2 = 95%). ROSC in the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients were 13.3% vs. 26.5%, respectively (OR = 0.67; 95% CI: 0.55, 0.81; p < 0.001). SHD with favorable neurological outcome was observed in 0% in COVID-19 vs. 3.1% in non-COVID-19 patients (OR = 1.35; 95% CI: 0.07, 26.19; p = 0.84). Our meta-analysis suggests that suspected or diagnosed COVID-19 reduces the SHD rate after OHCA, which seems to be due to the lower rate of shockable rhythms in COVID-19 patients, but not due to reluctance to bystander CPR. Future trials are needed to confirm these preliminary results and determine the optimal procedures to increase survival after OHCA in COVID-19 patients.","Borkowska, Magdalena J; Jaguszewski, Milosz J; Koda, Mariusz; Gasecka, Aleksandra; Szarpak, Agnieszka; Gilis-Malinowska, Natasza; Safiejko, Kamil; Szarpak, Lukasz; Filipiak, Krzysztof J; Smereka, Jacek",,,476

This study used a retrospective, observational analysis of deidentified tests performed at a national clinical laboratory to determine if circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels are associated with severe acute respiratory disease coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positivity rates. Over 190,000 patients from all 50 states with SARS-CoV-2 results performed mid-March through mid-June, 2020 and matching 25(OH)D results from the preceding 12 months were included. Residential zip code data was required to match with US Census data and perform analyses of race/ethnicity proportions and latitude. A total of 191,779 patients were included (median age, 54 years [interquartile range 40.4-64.7]; 68% female. The SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate was 9.3% (95% C.I. 9.2-9.5%) and the mean seasonally adjusted 25(OH)D was 31.7 (SD 11.7). The SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate was higher in the 39,190 patients with ""deficient"" 25(OH)D values (<20 ng/mL) (12.5%, 95% C.I. 12.2-12.8%) than in the 27,870 patients with ""adequate"" values (30-34 ng/mL) (8.1%, 95% C.I. 7.8-8.4%) and the 12,321 patients with values &#8805;55 ng/mL (5.9%, 95% C.I. 5.5-6.4%). The association between 25(OH)D levels and SARS-CoV-2 positivity was best fitted by the weighted second-order polynomial regression, which indicated strong correlation in the total population (R2 = 0.96) and in analyses stratified by all studied demographic factors. The association between lower SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates and higher circulating 25(OH)D levels remained significant in a multivariable logistic model adjusting for all included demographic factors (adjusted odds ratio 0.984 per ng/mL increment, 95% C.I. 0.983-0.986; p<0.001). SARS-CoV-2 positivity is strongly and inversely associated with circulating 25(OH)D levels, a relationship that persists across latitudes, races/ethnicities, both sexes, and age ranges. Our findings provide impetus to explore the role of vitamin D supplementation in reducing the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease.","Kaufman, Harvey W; Niles, Justin K; Kroll, Martin H; Bi, Caixia; Holick, Michael F",PLoS One,,476

The new coronavirus responsible for this outbreak-SARS-CoV-2-shares high sequence identity to SARS-CoV and a bat coronavirus, RaTG132. Although bats may be the reservoir host for a variety of coronaviruses3,4, it remains unknown whether SARS-CoV-2 has additional host species. Here we show that a coronavirus, which we name pangolin-CoV, isolated from a Malayan pangolin has 100%, 98.6%, 97.8% and 90.7% amino acid identity with SARS-CoV-2 in the E, M, N and S proteins, respectively. In particular, the receptor-binding domain of the S protein of pangolin-CoV is almost identical to that of SARS-CoV-2, with one difference in a noncritical amino acid. Our comparative genomic analysis suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may have originated in the recombination of a virus similar to pangolin-CoV with one similar to RaTG13. Pangolin-CoV was detected in 17 out of the 25 Malayan pangolins that we analysed. Infected pangolins showed clinical signs and histological changes, and circulating antibodies against pangolin-CoV reacted with the S protein of SARS-CoV-2. The isolation of a coronavirus from pangolins that is closely related to SARS-CoV-2 suggests that these animals have the potential to act as an intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2. This newly identified coronavirus from pangolins-the most-trafficked mammal in the illegal wildlife trade-could represent a future threat to public health if wildlife trade is not effectively controlled.","Xiao, Kangpeng; Zhai, Junqiong; Feng, Yaoyu; Zhou, Niu; Zhang, Xu; Zou, Jie-Jian; Li, Na; Guo, Yaqiong; Li, Xiaobing; Shen, Xuejuan; Zhang, Zhipeng; Shu, Fanfan; Huang, Wanyi; Li, Yu; Zhang, Ziding; Chen, Rui-Ai; Wu, Ya-Jiang; Peng, Shi-Ming; Huang, Mian; Xie, Wei-Jun; Cai, Qin-Hui; Hou, Fang-Hui; Chen, Wu; Xiao, Lihua; Shen, Yongyi",Nature (Lond.),,476
250388,Using excess deaths and testing statistics to determine COVID-19 mortalities,2021,"BACKGROUND: In the United States, alcohol use disorder (AUD) is common and costly but substantially undertreated. Rurality is an important determinant of health that may influence receipt of evidence-based alcohol-related care. In a large, national sample of Veterans Health Administration (VA) patients with AUD with documented and non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, or non-Hispanic White race/ethnicity, we examine whether meeting national Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) quality measures for specialty addictions care and receiving evidence-based medications for AUD differs across patients living in urban, large rural, and small rural areas. Methods: VA electronic health record data were used to identify all patients with AUD documented in Fiscal Year 2012. Rurality was measured using a three-category rural and urban commuting area (RUCA) classification linked to patient zip code. Logistic regression models with clustered standard errors-iteratively adjusted for hypothesized confounders-were used to estimate the likelihood and marginal probabilities of receiving care for patients living in small and large rural areas, relative to urban areas. Primary outcomes included HEDIS initiation (any visit within 14 days of initial AUD visit after a 60-day period of no treatment), HEDIS engagement (2 or more AUD visits within 30 days of HEDIS initiation visit) and having any filled prescription for AUD medications (naltrexone, disulfiram, acamprosate, or topiramate). Results: For all outcomes, patients living in large and small rural areas had a lower likelihood of receiving evidence-based AUD treatment than patients living in urban areas (all p-values < 0.05); differences in marginal probabilities across groups were relatively small. Conclusions: In this national sample of VA patients with AUD, those living in more rural areas were less likely to receive evidence-based treatment for AUD than those living in urban areas. Further research is needed to investigate strategies to increase receipt of specialty care and pharmacotherapy in more rural areas.","Edmonds, Amy T; Bensley, Kara M; Hawkins, Eric J; Williams, Emily C",Subst Abus,,476

Since there are no specific drugs or vaccines, the available tools against COVID-19 are preventive, such as the use of personal protective equipment, social distancing, lockdowns, and mass testing. Such measures are hindered in Brazil due to a restrict budget, low educational level of the population, and misleading attitudes from the federal authorities. Predictions for COVID-19 are of pivotal importance to subsidize and mobilize health authorities' efforts in applying the necessary preventive strategies. The Weibull distribution was used to model the forecast prediction of COVID-19, in four scenarios, based on the curve of daily new deaths as a function of time. The date in which the number of daily new deaths will fall below the rate of 3 deaths per million - the average level in which some countries start to relax the stay-at-home measures - was estimated. If the daily new deaths curve was bending today (i.e., about 1250 deaths per day), the predicted date would be on July 5. Forecast predictions allowed the estimation of overall death toll at the end of the outbreak. Our results suggest that each additional day that lasts to bend the daily new deaths curve may correspond to additional 1685 deaths at the end of COVID-19 outbreak in Brazil (R2 = 0.9890). Predictions of the outbreak can be used to guide Brazilian health authorities in the decision-making to properly fight COVID-19 pandemic.","Moreau, Vitor Hugo",Braz J Microbiol,,476

Clusters and possibly increased diffuse transmission could occur in the context of the next influenza season. For this reason, a diagnostic test able to discriminate SARS-CoV-2 from influenza viruses is urgently needed. METHODS: A multiplex rt-Real Time PCR assay was assessed using one laboratory protocol with different Real Time PCR instruments. Overall, 1,000 clinical samples (600 samples SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, 200 samples from influenza infected patients and 200 negative samples) were analyzed. RESULTS: The assay developed was able to detect and discriminate each virus target, and to intercept co-infections. The limit of quantification of each assay ranged between 5 and 10 genomic copy numbers, with a cutoff value of 37.7 and 37.8 for influenza and SARS-CoV-2 viruses, respectively. Only two influenza co-infections were detected in COVID-19 samples. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that multiplex assay is a rapid, valid, and accurate method for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses in clinical samples. The test may be an important diagnostic tool for both diagnostic and surveillance purposes during the seasonal influenza activity period.","Mancini, Fabiola; Barbanti, Fabrizio; Scaturro, Maria; Fontana, Stefano; Di Martino, Angela; Marsili, Giulia; Puzelli, Simona; Calzoletti, Laura; Facchini, Marzia; Di Mario, Giuseppina; Fabiani, Concetta; Dstat, Antonino Bella; Riccardo, Flavia; Dstat, Patrizio Pezzotti; Stefanelli, Paola; Rezza, Giovanni; Ciervo, Alessandra",J Infect Dis,,476

These brief reflections aim to make the problem visible, offer theoretical explanations and some recommendations. The pandemic constitutes a massive crisis that triggers fears and reassuring of diffuse anxieties, which often includes someone to blame. Healthcare workers have become circumstantial scapegoating targets. The inflicted attacks can be understood as reactive hate crimes since they are originated from an allegedly healthy person to an allegedly contaminated person. People seems to incur in a sanitary profiling process based on the health worker's uniform. However, these expressions of hatred are fueled by pre-pandemic circumstances such as the precariousness of health systems and deficient medical equipment, misogyny, or the pervasiveness of authoritarian tendencies. Understanding this situation as a human rights issue, it is suggested to consider measures in order to discourage these attacks, such as: guaranteeing the appropriate conditions of hospitals and the personal protective equipment of workers; development of recognition campaigns of the healthcare staff and the work they carry out (in particular female nurses); and implementing transitory regulations that sanction any hate crime type attack to health workers or the scientific community. Furthermore, educational advocacy efforts should reiterate basic hygiene measures for the people, but also focus on refuting false and pseudoscientific beliefs that contribute to the fear-induced construction of the health worker as a threat of contagion.(AU)","Orellana, Carlos I",Rev. salud pública,,476
252482,Considerations for educators in supporting student learning in the midst of COVID-19,2020,"In the decades since the discovery of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), its protective role in terms of antagonizing activation of the classical renin-angiotensin system (RAS) axis has been recognized in clinical and experimental studies on kidney and cardiovascular diseases. The effects of ACE inhibitor/angiotensin type 1 receptor blockers (ACEi/ARBs) on ACE2-angiotensin-(1-7) (Ang- (1-7))-Mas receptor (MasR) axis activation has encouraged the use of such blockers in patients with kidney and cardiovascular diseases, until the emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The previously unchallenged functions of the ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-MasR axis and ACEi/ARBs are being re-evaluated in the era of COVID-19; the hypothesis is that ACEi/ARBs may increase the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection by upregulating the human ACE2 receptor expression level. In this review, we examine ACE2 molecular structure, function (as an enzyme of the RAS), and distribution. We explore the roles played by ACE2 in kidney, cardiovascular, and pulmonary diseases, highlighting studies that defined the benefits imparted when ACEi/ARBs activated the local ACE2- Ang-(1-7)-MasR axis. Finally, the question of whether ACEi/ARBs therapies should be stopped in COVID-19-infected patients will be reviewed by reference to the available evidence.","Suh, Sang Heon; Ma, Seong Kwon; Kim, Soo Wan; Bae, Eun Hui",Korean J Intern Med,,476

We find that regional policy coordination is critical to mitigate and isolate the pandemic shock. It is important to identify the pandemic events early to flatten the pandemic curve at the national and regional level. This supports a recent study by the World Bank (2020), which highlights the importance of early mitigation policies during the pandemic shock. The cost of the pandemic and economic shocks will increase significantly when several countries in the region experience the pandemic shock concurrently. In this case, flattening the regional pandemic curve becomes important. The results also indicate the need for greater coordination in East Asia to mitigate the pending economic shock in terms of unemployment, corporate bankruptcy and financial market fragility. The paper also highlights that the stability of the GVC network is critical during the pandemic in terms of hedging the risk of disruptions to the procurement of critical medical and health products as well as maintaining service linkages to manufacturing, such as the logistics sector. Regional policy coordination and the stability of GVC will be valuable in the post-pandemic recovery of the region.","Kimura, Fukunari; Thangavelu, Shandre Mugan; Narjoko, Dionisius; Findlay, Christopher",Asian Econ.

COVID-19 and Japan's School Meals,2021,"Despite the long-term survival rates of osseointegrated dental implants, several biological complications are known to affect the peri-implant tissues, such as peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis. Occasionally, the clinical features of these more common benign lesions, or others nonrelated to implants, might be similar to oral malignancies, leading to misdiagnosis. The objective of this study was to present a case series of oral cancer located adjacent to dental implants, aimed to identify the reasons for initial misinterpretation of diagnosis. Thirteen patients, 10 females and 3 males, aged 59 to 90, were assessed. Among the differential diagnoses established, a malignant or premalignant lesion was not considered in 10 out of the 13 patients. Peri-implantitis was the most common preliminary diagnosis, followed by fungal infection, viral infections, and traumatic ulcers. The meantime for the diagnosis of oral cancer was 21.5 months. The clinical presentation of peri-implant malignancy, such as ulceration, white and red plaques, and exophytic lesions, might mimic benign diseases that are more common in the oral cavity. Suspicious lesions with treatment failure that persist for more than 2 weeks require biopsy and histopathological analysis to establish an early definitive diagnosis to improve the prognosis and quality of life of the patients.","Miranda Galvis, Marisol; Schausltz Pereira Faustino, Isabel; Cabral Ramos, Joab; Dos Santos Silva, Alan Roger; de Abreu Alves, Fábio; Kowalski, Luiz Paulo; Ajudarte Lopes, Marcio",Aust. dent. j,,476
253893,Is COVID-19 Posed Great Challenges for Malaria Control and Elimination?,2021,"OBJECTIVES: To explore the relationship between psychosocial support related factors and the mental health of COVID-19 positive patients. METHODS: This exploratory study of 35 COVID-19 positive patients were enrolled between February 1 to March 1, 2020. Sleep quality, depression, anxiety, and social support were measured and social support related data of participants were collected. Psychological intervention was administered and patients were followed two weeks post intervention. Linear regression was performed to explore the relationship between psychosocial risk factors and improvement of psychological symptoms. FINDINGS: Thirty-two individuals exhibited sleep, depressive and anxiety symptoms which improved post support intervention. At baseline, symptoms were associated with gender, severity of pneumonia, social support. Better social support at follow-up and improvement from COVID-19 predicted improvement in their psychological symptoms. DISCUSSION: This initial evidence from China may stress the importance of administering psychosocial intervention during the treatment of COVID-19 for better patient outcomes in other countries.","Yang, Xiao; Yang, Xiufang; Kumar, Poornima; Cao, Bingrong; Ma, Xiaohong; Li, Tao",Nurs. outlook,,476

254374,Rethinking the First COVID-19 Death in Turkey,2020,"The virus behind the current pandemic, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the etiology of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and poses a critical public health threat worldwide. Effective therapeutics and vaccines against multiple coronaviruses remain unavailable. Single-chain variable fragment (scFv), a recombinant antibody, exhibits broad-spectrum antiviral activity against DNA and RNA viruses owing to its nucleic acid-hydrolyzing property. The antiviral activity of 3D8 scFv against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses was evaluated in Vero E6 cell cultures. Viral growth was quantified with quantitative RT-qPCR and plaque assay. The nucleic acid-hydrolyzing activity of 3D8 was assessed through abzyme assays of in vitro viral transcripts and cell viability was determined by MTT assay. We found that 3D8 inhibited the replication of SARS-CoV-2, human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). Our results revealed the prophylactic and therapeutic effects of 3D8 scFv against SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells. Immunoblot and plaque assays showed the reduction of coronavirus nucleoproteins and infectious particles, respectively, in 3D8 scFv-treated cells. These data demonstrate the broad-spectrum antiviral activity of 3D8 against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. Thus, it could be considered a potential antiviral countermeasure against SARS-CoV-2 and zoonotic coronaviruses.","Lee, G.; Budhathoki, S.; Lee, G. Y.; Oh, K. J.; Ham, Y. K.; Kim, Y. J.; Lim, Y.

Data Structure: All Danish residents tested by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 in Denmark are included. The cohort is identified using the Danish Microbiology Database. Individual-level record linkage between administrative and health-care registries is facilitated by the Danish Civil Registration System. Information on outcomes related to SARS-CoV-2 infection includes hospital admission, intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, and death and is retrieved from the five administrative Danish regions, the Danish National Patient Registry, and the Danish Register of Causes of Death. The Patient Registry further provides a complete hospital contact history of somatic and psychiatric conditions and procedures. Data on all prescriptions filled at community pharmacies are available from the Danish National Prescription Registry. Health-care authorization status is obtained from the Danish Register of Healthcare Professionals. Finally, selected laboratory values are obtained from the Register of Laboratory Results for Research. The cohort is governed by a steering committee with representatives from the Danish Medicines Agency, Statens Serum Institut, the Danish Health Authority, the Danish Health Data Authority, Danish Patients, the Faculties of Health Sciences at the Danish universities, and Danish regions. The steering committee welcomes suggestions for research studies and collaborations. Research proposals will be prioritized based on timeliness and potential clinical and public health implications. All research protocols assessing specific hypotheses for medicines will be made publicly available using the European Union electronic Register of Post-Authorisation Studies. Conclusion: The Danish COVID-19 cohort includes all Danish residents with an RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2.

During this communication predicament, National Health Service (NHS) Digital announced the provision of Microsoft Teams, a digital communication and collaboration tool, which was implemented at Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust within 2 weeks.Method Given the need to deploy at scale, rapidly and with minimal resource, an agile decentralised innovation management approach was used, empowering staff to be local implementors.Results Resulting use cases were highly original and varied, ranging from a COVID-19 Education Programme to coordination of oxygen demand. Analytics showed rapid and persistent adoption, surpassing 500 daily active users within 11 days. Usage continues to increase, consistent with a direct network effect.Conclusion These findings suggest a high demand for this format of communication and high willingness to adopt it. Further qualitative research into staff perceptions would be valuable to confirm this, and to assess the user experience.Overall, this has been a radical approach to digital implementation in healthcare, and has so far proved effective in delivering a cost minimal, rapid communication tool at scale in the midst of a global pandemic.","Mehta, Jay; Yates, Timothy; Smith, Penelope; Henderson, Daisy; Winteringham, Glenn; Burns, Aine",,,476
255814,Challenges and opportunities brought by COVID-19: Understanding and prevention of COVID-19,2020,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: The novel coronavirus outbreak has caused substantial changes in societal norms as well as adjustments in health systems worldwide. To date the impact of these pandemic-related variations has yet to be fully understood also in the field of maternal health for which continuity of care is a proven life-saving preventive measure. DESIGN: Following the PRISMA guidelines for reviews, a literature search was carried out to assess different approaches that combine quality of maternal care with the imposed social-distancing rules. Nine studies were included in the scoping review. FINDINGS: Reduction of in-person visits is the preferred overall solution. Yet, fewer consultations can still guarantee essential services and appropriate care through integration with telemedicine. Referral to epidemic-free community centres is an alternative option and new paths need to include the interdisciplinary contribution of medical consultants and IT experts, among others. In this context, delaying access for symptomatic expectant mothers is still debated since it carries the potential risk of untimely detection of pregnancy complications. KEY CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary experiences provide an overview of the different attempts put in place to reshape health services to contain the pandemic hazards. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: These early prototypes may inspire future innovative health solutions compatible with local resources and specific population preferences and needs.","Montagnoli, Caterina; Zanconato, Giovanni; Ruggeri, Stefania; Cinelli, Giulia; Tozzi, Alberto Eugenio",Midwifery,,476

Anecdotally, investigations for children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have been restricted, resulting in diagnosis with no histological confirmation and potential secondary morbidity. In this study, we detail practice across the UK to assess impact on services and document the impact of the pandemic. METHODS: For the month of April 2020, 20 tertiary paediatric IBD centres were invited to contribute data detailing: (1) diagnosis/management of suspected new patients with IBD; (2) facilities available; (3) ongoing management of IBD; and (4) direct impact of COVID-19 on patients with IBD. RESULTS: All centres contributed. Two centres retained routine endoscopy, with three unable to perform even urgent IBD endoscopy. 122 patients were diagnosed with IBD, and 53.3% (n=65) were presumed diagnoses and had not undergone endoscopy with histological confirmation. The most common induction was exclusive enteral nutrition (44.6%). No patients with a presumed rather than confirmed diagnosis were started on anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) therapy.Most IBD follow-up appointments were able to occur using phone/webcam or face to face. No biologics/immunomodulators were stopped. All centres were able to continue IBD surgery if required, with 14 procedures occurring across seven centres. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnostic IBD practice has been hugely impacted by COVID-19, with >50% of new diagnoses not having endoscopy. To date, therapy and review of known paediatric patients with IBD has continued. Planning and resourcing for recovery is crucial to minimise continued secondary morbidity.","Ashton, James John; Kammermeier, Jochen; Spray, Christine; Russell, Richard K; Hansen, Richard; Howarth, Lucy J; Torrente, Franco; Deb, Protima; Renji, Elizabeth; Muhammed, Rafeeq; Paul, Thankam; Kiparissi, Fevronia; Epstein, Jenny; Lawson, Maureen; Hope, Ben; Zamvar, Veena; Narula, Priya; Kadir, Ahmed; Devadason, David; Bhavsar, Hemant; Beattie, Robert Mark",Arch Dis Child,,476

The presumed pathophysiological mechanism is air leak due to extensive diffuse alveolar damage followed by alveolar rupture. (2) Methods: We followed the occurrence of PM, PN, PP, and subcutaneous emphysema (SE) in 1648 patients hospitalized during the second outbreak of COVID-19 (October 2020-January 2021) in the main hospital of infectious diseases of our county and recorded their demographic data, laboratory investigations and clinical evolution. (3) Results: Eleven patients (0.66%) developed PM, with eight of them having associated PT, one PP, and seven SE, in the absence of mechanical ventilation. Eight patients (72.72%) died and only three (27.27%) survived. All subjects were nonsmokers, without known pulmonary pathology or risk factors for such complications. (4) Conclusions: pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax, and pneumopericardium are not so uncommon complications of SARS-CoV2 pneumonia, being observed mostly in male patients with severe forms and associated with prolonged hospitalization and poor prognosis. In some cases, with mild forms and reduced pulmonary injury, the outcome is favorable, not requiring surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or intensive care stay.","Cut, Talida Georgiana; Tudoran, Cristina; Lazureanu, Voichita Elena; Marinescu, Adelina Raluca; Dumache, Raluca; Tudoran, Mariana",,,476

258370,Cultivating ethical leadership in the recovery of COVID-19,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Hip fracture is a common health risk among elderly people, due to the prevalence of osteoporosis and accidental fall in the population. Accurate assessment of fracture risk is a crucial step for clinicians to consider patient-by-patient optimal treatments for effective prevention of fractures. Image-based biomechanical modeling has shown promising progress in assessment of fracture risk, and there is still a great possibility for improvement. The purpose of this paper is to identify key issues that need be addressed to improve image-based biomechanical modeling. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We critically examined issues in consideration and determination of the four biomechanical variables, i.e., risk of fall, fall-induced impact force, bone geometry and bone material quality, which are essential for prediction of hip fracture risk. We closely inspected: limitations introduced by assumptions that are adopted in existing models; deficiencies in methods for construction of biomechanical models, especially for determination of bone material properties from bone images; problems caused by separate use of the variables in clinical study of hip fracture risk; availability of clinical information that are required for validation of biomechanical models. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: A number of critical issues and gaps were identified. Strategies for effectively addressing the issues were discussed.","Luo, Yunhua",J. bone miner. metab,,476

This paper adds to the small but fundamental body of work on benchmarking the robustness of DL classifiers on defective images. Unlike existed single-factor digital perturbation work, we provide state-of-the-art two-factor perturbation that provides two natural perturbations on images applied in different sequences. The two-factor perturbation includes (1) two digital perturbations (Salt&pepper noise and Gaussian noise) applied in both sequences. (2) one digital perturbation (salt&pepper noise) and a geometric perturbation (rotation) applied in different sequences. To measure robust DL classifiers, previous scientists provided 15 types of single-factor corruption. We created 69 benchmarking image sets, including a clean set, sets with single factor perturbations, and sets with two-factor perturbation conditions. To be best of our knowledge, this is the first report that two-factor perturbed images improves both robustness and accuracy of DL classifiers. Previous research evaluating deep learning (DL) classifiers has often used top-1/top-5 accuracy, so researchers have usually offered tables, line diagrams, and bar charts to display accuracy of DL classifiers. But these existed approaches cannot quantitively evaluate robustness of DL classifiers. We innovate a new two-dimensional, statistical visualization tool, including mean accuracy and coefficient of variation (CV), to benchmark the robustness of DL classifiers. All source codes and related image sets are shared on websites (http://cslinux.semo.edu/david/data.html or https://github.com/daiweiworking/RobustDeepLearningUsingPerturbations ) to support future academic research and industry projects.","Dai, Wei; Berleant, Daniel",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.03102v3.pdf,476

Re: ""Strategy for the practice of digestive and oncological surgery during the COVID-19 epidemic""",2020,"BACKGROUND: Pre-existing cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) have been proposed to identify patients at higher risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes, but existing evidence is conflicting. Thus, it is unclear whether pre-existing CVDs are independently important predictors for severe COVID-19. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a nationwide Danish cohort of hospital-screened COVID-19 patients aged > =40, we investigated if pre-existing CVDs predict the 30-day risk of (1) composite outcome of severe COVID-19 and (2) all-cause mortality. We estimated 30-day risks using a Cox regression model including age, sex, each CVD comorbidity, COPD-asthma, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease. To illustrate CVD comorbidities' importance, we evaluated the predicted risks of death and severe infection, for each sex, along ages 40 - 85. 4,090 COVID-19 hospital-screened patients were observed as of August 26, 2020; 22.1% had &#8805; 1 CVD, 23.7% had severe infection within 30 days and 12.6% died. Predicted risks of both outcomes at age 75 among men with single CVD comorbidities did not differ in clinically meaningful amounts compared to men with no comorbidities risks for the composite outcome of severe infection; women with heart failure (28.2%; 95% CI 21.1%-37.0%) or atrial fibrillation (30.0%; 95% CI: 24.2%-36.9%) showed modest increases compared to women with no comorbidities (24.0%; 95% CI: 21.4%-26.9%). CONCLUSIONS: The results showing only modest effects of CVDs on increased risks of poor COVID-19 outcomes are important in allowing public health authorities and clinicians to provide more tailored guidance to cardiovascular patients, who have heretofore been grouped together as high-risk due to their disease status.","Phelps, Matthew; Christensen, Daniel Mølager; Gerds, Thomas; Fosbøl, Emil; Torp-Pedersen, Christian; Schou, Morten; Køber, Lars; Kragholm, Kristian; Andersson, Charlotte; Biering-Sørensen, Tor; Christensen, Helle Collatz; Andersen, Mikkel Porsborg; Gislason, Gunnar",Eur.

The rapid and effortless spread of the virus has led the World Health Organization to adopt unprecedented large-scale preventive measures. Our aim is to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of medical students, and to evaluate their awareness and aptitude for contributing to the fight against COVID-19 contagion. METHODS: PubMed electronic database was employed for the research using the following terms: ""medical students and COVID-19"", ""mental health of medical students and COVID-19"", ""knowledge of medical students and COVID-19"", ""preventive behavior of medical students and COVID-19"". RESULTS: Twenty-one articles were included; ten assess the knowledge of medical students on COVID-19, seven present whether they demonstrate appropriate preventive behavior according to global guidelines, seven examine the impact of the pandemic on their mental health, five examine their role on the side of trained healthcare workers. Some articles combine more than one of the above mentioned domains. CONCLUSIONS: Medical students seem to demonstrate an adequate level of knowledge upon COVID-19 and implement proper strategies to prevent its spread. Further training is essential to improve some aspects in this field. Social media has proven to be the optimal source of information for medical students, which is incompatible with their future careers as doctors. The pandemic had a negative impact on medical students, expressed as fear regarding the virus spread; nevertheless, many have felt the need to assist healthcare systems under appropriate precautions.","Magklara, Elli; Angelis, Stavros; Solia, Eirini; Katsimantas, Antonios; Kourlaba, Georgia; Kostakis, Georgios; Tsakotos, Georgios; Zaoutis, Theoklis; Filippou, Dimitrios",Acta Biomed,,476

Focusing on the conditions in Bali, this study explored the level of compliance to public health measures targeted at COVID-19 and identified the determinants of compliance via the values, rules, and knowledge approach. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study conducted an online survey using the Google Form application from June 29 to July 5, 2020. The minimum required sample size was 664. Inclusion criteria were set as follows: 18 years of age or older and residing in Bali during the data collection period. Adherence was measured based on nine protocol indicators that were rated using a four-point Likert scale. A multiple linear regression analysis was then conducted to determine the associated factors of adherence to public health measures. Results: Of the 954 survey respondents, data from 743 were included for analysis. The average level of adherence to public health measures was 32.59 (range of 20-36). The linear regression analysis showed that perceived health benefits from public health measures, being female, and having COVID-19 test histories were significantly associated with adherence to public health measures. Conclusions: For public health measures targeted at COVID-19, adherence was strongly associated with perceived social norms, in which individuals played social community roles by adapting to standardized public health measures. It is thus imperative for governments to support and monitor public health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Indrayathi, Putu Ayu; Januraga, Pande Putu; Pradnyani, Putu Erma; Gesesew, Hailay Abrha; Ward, Paul Russel",Front Public Health,,476

METHODS: In this retrospective multicenter study, 372 hospitalized patients with nonsevere COVID-19 were followed for > 15 days after admission. Patients who deteriorated to severe or critical COVID-19 and those who maintained a nonsevere state were assigned to the severe and nonsevere groups, respectively. Based on baseline data of the 2 groups, we constructed a risk prediction nomogram for severe COVID-19 and evaluated its performance. RESULTS: The training cohort consisted of 189 patients, and the 2 independent validation cohorts consisted of 165 and 18 patients. Among all cases, 72 (19.4%) patients developed severe COVID-19. Older age; higher serum lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, coefficient of variation of red blood cell distribution width, blood urea nitrogen, and direct bilirubin; and lower albumin were associated with severe COVID-19. We generated the nomogram for early identifying severe COVID-19 in the training cohort (area under the curve [AUC], 0.912 [95% confidence interval {CI}, .846-.978]; sensitivity 85.7%, specificity 87.6%) and the validation cohort (AUC, 0.853 [95% CI, .790-.916]; sensitivity 77.5%, specificity 78.4%). The calibration curve for probability of severe COVID-19 showed optimal agreement between prediction by nomogram and actual observation. Decision curve and clinical impact curve analyses indicated that nomogram conferred high clinical net benefit. CONCLUSIONS: Our nomogram could help clinicians with early identification of patients who will progress to severe COVID-19, which will enable better centralized management and early treatment of severe disease.","Gong, Jiao; Ou, Jingyi; Qiu, Xueping; Jie, Yusheng; Chen, Yaqiong; Yuan, Lianxiong; Cao, Jing; Tan, Mingkai; Xu, Wenxiong; Zheng, Fang; Shi, Yaling; Hu, Bo",Clin Infect Dis,,476
260870,Neurological and Psychiatric Consequences of COVID-19 Epidemic,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To report the results of a survey exploring the experience of patients with SLE facing hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) shortage that occurred during the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A survey was designed by Lupus Europe's patient advisory network and distributed through its social media, newsflash and members' network. People with lupus were asked about their last HCQ purchases and their level of anxiety (on a 0-10 scale) with regard to not being able to have access to HCQ, once in April 2020 (first wave) and after 11 August (second wave). The results were compared. RESULTS: 2075 patients responded during the first wave; 1001 (48.2%) could get HCQ from the first place they asked, 230 (11.1%) could get the drug by going to more than one pharmacy, 498 (24.0%) obtained HCQ later from their usual pharmacy and 126 (6.1%) from other sources. 188 (9.1%) could not get any; 32 (1.5%) did not respond to this question. All countries showed significant improvement in HCQ availability during the second wave. 562 (27.4%) patients reported an extremely high level of anxiety in wave 1 and 162 (10.3%) patients in wave 2; 589 (28.7%) and 268 (17.1%) patients reported a high level of anxiety in wave 1 and wave 2, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The HCQ shortage had a significant impact on patients with SLE and has been responsible for psychological consequences including anxiety. Indeed, despite an objective improvement in drug availability, the event is leaving significant traces in patients' mind and behaviours.","Cornet, Alain; Andersen, Jeanette; Tani, Chiara; Mosca, Marta",,,476

Therapeutics targeting different components and processes of the viral infection replication cycle are being investigated, particularly to repurpose already approved drugs. Spike protein is an important target for both vaccines and therapeutics. Insights into the mechanisms of spike-ACE2 binding and cell fusion could support the identification of compounds with inhibitory effects. Here, we demonstrate that the integrity of disulfide bonds within the receptor-binding domain (RBD) plays an important role in the membrane fusion process although their disruption does not prevent binding of spike protein to ACE2. Several reducing agents and thiol-reactive compounds are able to inhibit viral entry. N-acetyl cysteine amide, L-ascorbic acid, JTT-705, and auranofin prevented syncytia formation, viral entry into cells, and infection in a mouse model, supporting disulfides of the RBD as a therapeutically relevant target.","Mancek-Keber, Mateja; Hafner-Bratkovic, Iva; Lainscek, Dusko; Bencina, Mojca; Govednik, Tea; Orehek, Sara; Plaper, Tjasa; Jazbec, Vid; Bergant, Valter; Grass, Vincent; Pichlmair, Andreas; Jerala, Roman",FASEB J,,476

264377,Covid-19: An Urgent Need For A Psychoneuroendocrine Perspective,2020,"The nano-carbon graphene has unique structural and physicochemical properties, which are conducive to various biomedical applications. We assessed the effect of graphene oxide (GO) on tomato plants at the seedling and mature stages in terms of morphological and biochemical indices. GO treatment significantly improved the shoot/stem growth of tomato in a dose-dependent manner by increasing the cortical cells number, cross-sectional area, diameter and vascular-column area. In addition, GO also promoted the morphological development of the root system and increased biomass accumulation. The surface area of root tips and hairs of tomato plants treated with 50 mg/L and 100 mg/L GO were significantly greater compared to the untreated control. At the molecular level, GO induced the expression of root development-related genes (SlExt1 and LeCTR1) and inhibited the auxin-responsive gene (SlIAA3). However, 50 mg/L and 100 mg/L GO significantly increased the root auxin content, which in turn increased the number of fruits and hastened fruit ripening compared to the control plants. Taken together, GO can improve the tomato growth when used at the appropriate concentration, and is a promising nano-carbon material for agricultural use.","Guo, Xuhu; Zhao, Jianguo; Wang, Runmei; Zhang, Hongchi; Xing, Baoyan; Naeem, Muhammad; Yao, Tianjun; Li, Rongqing; Xu, Rongfang; Zhang, Zhaofeng; Wu, Jiaxian",Plant Physiol Biochem,,476

Nanotechnology has played a significant role in the success of these vaccines. Nanoparticles (NPs) aid in improving stability by protecting the encapsulated mRNA from ribonucleases and facilitate delivery of intact mRNA to the target site. The overwhelming success of these two mRNA based vaccines with ~95% efficacy in phase 3 clinical trials can be attributed to their unique nanocarrier, the ""lipid nanoparticles"" (LNPs). LNPs are unique compared with bilayered liposomes and provide improved stability of the cargo, possess rigid morphology, and aid in better cellular penetration. This EUA is a major milestone and showcases the immense potential of nanotechnology for vaccine delivery and for fighting against future pandemics. Currently, these two vaccines are aiding in the alleviation of the COVID-19 health crisis and demonstrate the potential utility of nanomedicine for tackling health problems at the global level.","Khurana, Amit; Allawadhi, Prince; Khurana, Isha; Allwadhi, Sachin; Weiskirchen, Ralf; Banothu, Anil Kumar; Chhabra, Deepak; Joshi, Kamaldeep; Bharani, Kala Kumar",Nano Today,,476

A 22-item survey was administered to 229 volunteers in the St. Louis region who tutor children through the Oasis Intergenerational Tutoring program. Although most respondents are familiar with technology and expressed that they are likely to volunteer virtually, their responses varied significantly by age, education, gender, income, and school districts. Some tutors expressed that virtual volunteering may eliminate barriers to in-person volunteering, while others were concerned with establishing a personal connection with students online. These findings suggest that tutors anticipate both benefits and challenges with virtual volunteering and that efforts to engage older adults during the pandemic should factor in prior use of technology and ensure that different subgroups are not marginalized.","Sun, Peter C; Morrow-Howell, Nancy; Pawloski, Elizabeth; Helbach, Alexander",J Appl Gerontol,,476

We sought to estimate case detection percentages with various routine NP and saliva testing frequencies. DESIGN: Simulation modeling study. METHODS: We constructed a sensitivity function based on the average infectiousness profile of symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases to determine the probability of being identified at the time of testing. This function was fitted to reported data on the percent positivity of symptomatic COVID-19 patients using NP testing. We then simulated a routine testing program with different NP and saliva testing frequencies to determine case detection percentages during the infectious period, as well as the presymptomatic stage. RESULTS: Routine biweekly NP testing, once every 2 weeks, identified an average of 90.7% (SD, 0.18) of cases during the infectious period and 19.7% (SD, 0.98) during the presymptomatic stage. With a weekly NP testing frequency, the corresponding case detection percentages were 95.9% (SD, 0.18) and 32.9% (SD, 1.23), respectively. A 5-day saliva testing schedule had a similar case detection percentage as weekly NP testing during the infectious period, but identified ~10% more cases (mean, 42.5%; SD, 1.10) during the presymptomatic stage. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the utility of routine noninvasive saliva testing for frontline healthcare workers to protect vulnerable patient populations. A 5-day saliva testing schedule should be considered to help identify silent infections and prevent outbreaks in nursing homes and healthcare facilities.","Zhang, Kevin; Shoukat, Affan; Crystal, William; Langley, Joanne M; Galvani, Alison P; Moghadas, Seyed M",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,,476

Recently the test-negative design was proposed to recruit and survey participants who are being tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection in order to evaluate associations between their characteristics and testing positive on the test. It was also proposed to recruit additional untested controls who are part of the general public in order to have a baseline comparison group. This study design involves two major challenges for statistical risk factor analysis: 1) the selection bias invoked by selecting on people being tested and 2) imperfect sensitivity and specificity of the SARS-CoV-2 test. In this study, we investigate the nonparametric identifiability of potential statistical parameters of interest under a hypothetical data structure, expressed through missing data directed acyclic graphs. We clarify the types of data that must be collected in order to correctly estimate the parameter of interest. We then propose a novel inverse probability weighting estimator that can consistently estimate the parameter of interest under correctly specified nuisance models.","Schnitzer, Mireille E.; Harel, Daphna; Ho, Vikki; Koushik, Anita; Merckx, Joanna",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.03140v1.pdf,476

In an attempt to control its spread, countries have imposed local and national lockdowns, affecting many healthcare services, especially sexual and reproductive health services which are actually essential and lifesaving. In near future this will result in a large number of grave consequences including increased unmet need for modern contraceptives, unintended pregnancies, increased unsafe abortions, maternal and neonatal deaths and other harmful practices like female genital mutilation and child marriages in developing countries. The present short review focusses on such issues which will be dramatically increased depending on the duration of lockdowns and the time for which the sexual and reproductive health services will remain halted. It also reflects the need for considering reproductive health services as essential, allowing the people to avail these services without any fear and hence, saving many more lives which will be lost not due to coronavirus infection.

We compared the results of the Allplex&#8482; 2019-nCoV assay with those of the Simplexa&#8482; COVID-19 Direct assay and the Quanty COVID-19 assay, respectively, all performed on 125 nasal/oropharyngeal swab samples of patients with COVID-19 suspicion. Fifty-four samples were positive, and 71 were negative with the Allplex&#8482; assay, whereas 47 of 54 samples were also positive with the Simplexa&#8482; assay. The Quanty assay detected 55 positive samples, including the 54 positive samples with the Allplex&#8482; assay and 1 sample that was Allplex&#8482; negative but Simplexa&#8482; positive. Using a consensus result criterion as the reference standard allowed to resolve the eight samples with discordant results (one Allplex&#8482; negative and seven Simplexa&#8482; negative) as truly false negative. Interestingly, a Spearman's negative association was found between the viral RNA loads quantified by the Quanty assay and the CT values of RT PCRs performed with either the Allplex&#8482; assay or the Simplexa&#8482; assay. However, the strength of this association was higher for the Allplex&#8482; assay (N gene, &#961; = - 0.92; RdRP gene, &#961; = - 0.91) than for the Simplexa&#8482; assay (ORF1ab gene, &#961; = - 0.65; S gene, &#961; = - 0.80).

Here, human programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) peptides were used for the first time for the modification of gold nanoprisms (GNPs) to enhance targeting efficiency. A multifunctional nanoprobe was developed that the GNPs@PEG/Ce6-PD-L1 peptide (GNPs@PEG/Ce6-P) was used for imaging-guided photothermal/photodynamic therapy by using the targeting effect of PD-L1. Both confocal imaging and flow cytometry experiments demonstrated a remarkable affinity of the as-prepared nanoprobes GNPs@PEG/Ce6-P to lung cancer cells (HCC827), which have a high PD-L1 expression. Subsequent in vitro and in vivo experiments further demonstrated that the nanoprobes GNPs@PEG/Ce6-P not only allowed for real-time visualization via fluorescence (FL) imaging and photoacoustic (PA) imaging, but also served as phototherapy agents for synergistic photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT). Furthermore, treatments on human lung cancer cells-derived tumors demonstrated that the nanoprobes GNPs@PEG/Ce6-P could significantly suppress tumor growth through PTT and PDT from GNPs and Ce6, respectively. In conclusion, the as-prepared new nanoprobes show promising potential for nanomedicine with remarkable targeting ability for dual-mode imaging and enhanced PDT and PTT effects on lung cancer.","Liu, Bin; Qiao, Guanglei; Han, Yu; Shen, E; Alfranca, Gabriel; Tan, Haisong; Wang, Lirui; Pan, Shaojun; Ma, Lijun; Xiong, Wujun; Liu, Yanlei; Cui, Daxiang",Acta biomater,,476

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) manifests itself through a wide spectrum of symptoms that can evolve to severe presentations as pneumonia and several non-respiratory complications. Increased susceptibility to COVID-19 hospitalization and mortality have been linked to associated comorbidities as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases and, recently, to obesity. Similarly, individuals living with obesity are at greater risk to develop clinical complications and to have poor prognosis in severe influenza pneumonia. Immune and metabolic dysfunctions associated with the increased susceptibility to influenza infection are linked to obesity-associated low-grade inflammation, compromised immune and endocrine systems, and to high cardiovascular risk. These preexisting conditions may favor virological persistence, amplify immunopathological responses and worsen hemodynamic instability in severe COVID-19 as well. In this review we highlight the main factors and the current state of the art on obesity as risk factor for influenza and COVID-19 hospitalization, severe respiratory manifestations, extrapulmonary complications and even death. Finally, immunoregulatory mechanisms of severe influenza pneumonia in individuals with obesity are addressed as likely factors involved in COVID-19 pathophysiology.","Andrade, Fernanda B; Gualberto, Ana; Rezende, Camila; Percegoni, Nathércia; Gameiro, Jacy; Hottz, Eugenio D",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,,476

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective, single-centre study was conducted in Northern Italy. The primary study objectives were as follows: (a) to assess the incidence rate of ICU-acquired BSI and (b) to assess the cumulative risk of developing ICU-acquired BSI. RESULTS: Overall, 78 critically ill patients with COVID-19 were included in the study. Forty-five episodes of ICU-acquired BSI were registered in 31 patients, with an incidence rate of 47 episodes (95% confidence interval [CI] 35-63) per 1000 patient-days at risk. The estimated cumulative risk of developing at least one BSI episode was of almost 25% after 15 days at risk and possibly surpassing 50% after 30 days at risk. In multivariable analysis, anti-inflammatory treatment was independently associated with the development of BSI (cause-specific hazard ratio [csHR] 1.07 with 95% CI 0.38-3.04 for tocilizumab, csHR 3.95 with 95% CI 1.20-13.03 for methylprednisolone and csHR 10.69 with 95% CI 2.71-42.17 for methylprednisolone plus tocilizumab, with no anti-inflammatory treatment as the reference group; overall P for the dummy variable = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence rate of BSI was high, and the cumulative risk of developing BSI increased with ICU stay. Further study will clarify if the increased risk of BSI we detected in COVID-19 patients treated with anti-inflammatory drugs is outweighed by the benefits of reducing any possible pro-inflammatory dysregulation induced by SARS-CoV-2.","Giacobbe, Daniele Roberto; Battaglini, Denise; Ball, Lorenzo; Brunetti, Iole; Bruzzone, Bianca; Codda, Giulia; Crea, Francesca; De Maria, Andrea; Dentone, Chiara; Di Biagio, Antonio; Icardi, Giancarlo; Magnasco, Laura; Marchese, Anna; Mikulska, Malgorzata; Orsi, Andrea; Patroniti, Nicolò; Robba, Chiara; Signori, Alessio; Taramasso, Lucia; Vena, Antonio; Pelosi, Paolo; Bassetti, Matteo",Eur J Clin Invest,,476

268444,European Integration and National Elections After COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: The endocannabinoid system is gaining increasing attention as a favorable target for improving posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) treatments. Exposure therapy is the gold-standard treatment for PTSD, and fear extinction learning is a key concept underlying successful exposure. METHODS: This study examined the role of genetic endocannabinoid polymorphisms in a fear extinction paradigm with PTSD compared to healthy participants (N = 220). Participants provided saliva for genotyping, completed a fear conditioning and extinction task, with blood samples taken before and after the task (n = 57). Skin conductance was the outcome and was analyzed using mixed models. RESULTS: Results for cannabinoid receptor type 1 polymorphisms suggested that minor alleles of rs2180619 and rs1049353 were associated with poorer extinction learning in PTSD participants. The minor allele of the fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) polymorphism rs324420 was associated with worse extinction in PTSD participants. Subanalysis of healthy participants (n = 57) showed the FAAH rs324420 genotype effect was dependent on plasma arachidonoyl ethanolamide (AEA) level, but not oleoylethanolamide or 2-arachidonoyl glycerol. Specifically, higher but not lower AEA levels in conjunction with the minor allele of FAAH rs324420 were associated with better extinction learning. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide translational evidence that cannabinoid receptor 1 and AEA are involved in extinction learning in humans. FAAH rs324420's effect on fear extinction is moderated by AEA plasma level in healthy controls. These findings imply that FAAH inhibitors may be effective for targeting anxiety in PTSD, but this effect needs to be explored further in clinical populations.","Ney, Luke J; Matthews, Allison; Hsu, Chia-Ming Ken; Zuj, Daniel V; Nicholson, Emma; Steward, Trevor; Nichols, David; Graham, Bronwyn; Harrison, Ben; Bruno, Raimondo; Felmingham, Kim",Depress. anxiety,,476

Most kindergarten through grade 12 (K-12) public and private schools in Florida reopened for in-person learning during August 2020, with varying options for remote learning offered by school districts. During August 10-December 21, 2020, a total of 63,654 COVID-19 cases were reported in school-aged children; an estimated 60% of these cases were not school-related. Fewer than 1% of registered students were identified as having school-related COVID-19 and <11% of K-12 schools reported outbreaks. District incidences among students correlated with the background disease incidence in the county; resumption of in-person education was not associated with a proportionate increase in COVID-19 among school-aged children. Higher rates among students were observed in smaller districts, districts without mandatory mask-use policies, and districts with a lower proportion of students participating in remote learning. These findings highlight the importance of implementing both community-level and school-based strategies to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and suggest that school reopening can be achieved without resulting in widespread illness among students in K-12 school settings.","Doyle, Timothy; Kendrick, Katherine; Troelstrup, Thomas; Gumke, Megan; Edwards, Jerri; Chapman, Shay; Propper, Randy; Rivkees, Scott A; Blackmore, Carina",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,476

Analyses focused on the change of behavior from t1 to t2, on differences in these changes depending on socio-economic status (SES), and on associations of behavior with SES, the number of children at home, and the frequency of receiving learning materials from school. RESULTS: While the frequency of playing outside increased significantly from t1 to t2, the frequency of handicrafts, playing board games, indoor sports, and motivation to do schoolwork decreased. The observed changes between t1 and t2 did not differ depending on SES. However, a lower SES was associated with higher media use, less outdoor activity, and (though only marginally significant) a reduced time doing schoolwork and a reduced ability to concentrate on schoolwork at t1. In households with more children, children played outside more often, but were read to less frequently and (though only marginally significant) watched movies and series less frequently. Children receiving learning materials from school on a regular basis spent significantly more time doing schoolwork at home than children receiving materials only irregularly. CONCLUSIONS: A continuing loss of childcare in day-care facilities and schools entails the danger of declining education in the form of (inter)active indoor activities and schoolwork.","Poulain, Tanja; Meigen, Christof; Sobek, Carolin; Ober, Peggy; Igel, Ulrike; Körner, Antje; Kiess, Wieland; Vogel, Mandy",PLoS One,,476

270315,"Covid-19: Delaying school reopening by two weeks would halve risks to children, says iSAGE",2020,"Human exposure to infectious aerosols results in the transmission of diseases such as influenza, tuberculosis, and COVID-19. Most dental procedures generate a significant number of aerosolized particles, increasing transmission risk in dental settings. Since the generation of aerosols in dentistry is unavoidable, many clinics have started using intervention strategies such as area-filtration units and extraoral evacuation equipment, especially under the relatively recent constraints of the pandemic. However, the effectiveness of these devices in dental operatories has not been studied. Therefore, the ability of dental personnel to efficiently position and operate such instruments is also limited. To address these challenges, we utilized a real-time sensor network for assessment of aerosol dynamics during dental restoration and cleaning producers with and without intervention. The strategies tested during the procedures were (i) local area High-Efficiency Particle Air (HEPA) filters and (ii) Extra-Oral Suction Device (EOSD). The study was conducted at the University of Washington School of Dentistry using a network of 13 fixed sensors positioned within the operatory and one wearable sensor worn by the dental operator. The sensor network provides time and space-resolved particulate matter (PM) data. Three-dimensional (3D) visualization informed aerosol persistence in the operatory. It was found that area filters did not improve the overall aerosol concentration in dental offices in a significant way. A decrease in PM concentration by an average of 16% was observed when EOSD equipment was used during the procedures. The combination of real-time sensors and 3D visualization can provide dental personnel and facility managers with actionable feedback to effectively assess aerosol transmission in medical settings and develop evidence-based intervention strategies.","Makhsous, Sepehr; Segovia, Joelle M; He, Jiayang; Chan, Daniel; Lee, Larry; Novosselov, Igor V; Mamishev, Alexander V",Sensors (Basel),,476
270339,Strategies for Managing the Impacts of Disruptions During COVID-19: an Example of Toilet Paper,2020,"An extensive theoretical characterization of the singlet excited state manifold of the five canonical DNA/RNA nucleobases (thymine, cytosine, uracil, adenine and guanine) in gas-phase is carried out with time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) and restricted active space second-order perturbation theory (RASPT2) approaches. Both ground state and excited state absorptions are analyzed and compared between these different theoretical approaches, assessing the performance of the hybrid B3LYP and CAM-B3LYP (long-range corrected) functionals with respect to the RASPT2 reference. By comparing the TD-DFT estimates with our reference for high-lying excited states, we are able to narrow down specific energetic windows where TD-DFT may be safely employed to qualitatively reproduce the excited state absorption (ESA) signals registered in non-linear and time-resolved spectroscopy for monitoring photoinduced phenomena. Our results show a qualitative agreement between the RASPT2 reference and the B3LYP computed ESAs of pyrimidines in the near-IR/Visible spectral probing window while for purines the agreement is limited to the near-IR ESAs, with generally larger discrepancies obtained with the CAM-B3LYP functional. This outcome paves the way for appropriate application of cost-effective TD-DFT approaches to simulate linear and non-linear spectroscopies of realistic multichromophoric DNA/RNA systems with biological and nanotechnological relevance.","Jaiswal, Vishal K; Segarra-Martí, Javier; Marazzi, Marco; Zvereva, Elena; Assfeld, Xavier; Monari, Antonio; Garavelli, Marco; Rivalta, Ivan",Phys Chem Chem Phys,,476

This study aimed to use the ICF framework to classify outcome measures used in follow-up studies of coronavirus outbreaks and make recommendations for future studies. (2) Methods: EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL and PsycINFO were systematically searched for original studies assessing clinical outcomes in adult survivors of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS), middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) and coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) after hospital discharge. Individual items of the identified outcome measures were linked to ICF second-level and third-level categories using ICF linking rules and categorized according to an ICF component. (3) Results: In total, 33 outcome measures were identified from 36 studies. Commonly used (a) ICF body function measures were Pulmonary Function Tests (PFT), Impact of event scale (IES-R) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS); (b) ICF activity was 6-Minute Walking Distance (6MWD); (c) ICF participation measures included Short Form-36 (SF-36) and St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). ICF environmental factors and personal factors were rarely measured. (4) Conclusions: We recommend future COVID-19 follow-up studies to use the ICF framework to select a combination of outcome measures that capture all the components for a better understanding of the impact on survivors and planning interventions to maximize functional return.","Patel, Kajal; Straudi, Sofia; Yee Sien, Ng; Fayed, Nora; Melvin, John L; Sivan, Manoj",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,476

271681,COVID-19/Sociology,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Hypoalbuminemia is a negative acute phase reactant which has been associated with inflammatory response and poor outcome in infectious diseases. The aim of this study was to analyze the value of hypoalbuminemia on admission as a predictor of mortality and adverse events in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We analyzed retrospective data from a cohort of 609 consecutive patients, with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, discharged from hospital (deceased or alive). Demographic characteristics, previous comorbidities, symptoms and laboratory findings on admission were collected. Comorbidities were assessed by Charlson-Age Comorbidity Index. RESULTS: Hypoalbuminemia on admission (<34g/L) was more frequent in nonsurvivors than survivors (65.6% vs. 38%, p<0.001) and was significantly associated with the development of sepsis, macrophage activation syndrome, acute heart failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute kidney injury, regardless of Charlson-Age Comorbidity Index. Hypoalbuminemia was a predictor of mortality in multivariable Cox regression analysis (HR 1.537, 95% CI 1.050-2.250, p=0.027), independently of Charlson-Age Index, gender, lymphocyte count <800/µL, creatinine, high-sensitivity C- reactive protein >8mg/L, lactate dehydrogenase >250U/L, bilateral infiltration on chest X-ray and q-SOFA &#8805;2. CONCLUSIONS: Hypoalbuminemia was an early predictor of in-hospital mortality in COVID-19, regardless of age, comorbidity and inflammatory markers. It also had significant association with severe adverse events, independently of Charlson-Age Comorbidity Index. Our results suggest that serum albumin determination on admission may help to identify patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection at high risk of developing potential life-threatening conditions and death.","Viana-Llamas, María C; Arroyo-Espliguero, Ramón; Silva-Obregón, J Alberto; Uribe-Heredia, Giovanna; Núñez-Gil, Iván; García-Magallón, Belén; Torán-Martínez, Claudio G; Castillo-Sandoval, Alicia; Díaz-Caraballo, Eva; Rodríguez-Guinea, Itsaso; Domínguez-López, Jesús",Med. clin (Ed. impr.),,476

We evaluated depression, anxiety, sleep and quality of life in terms of gender, age, occupation and income level during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: A total of 352 individuals participating in this study online in &Iacute;stanbul were evaluated for depression using the Beck Depression index (BDI) and Beck Anxiety index (BAI), sleep quality using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality index (PSQI), quality of life using the short form-36 (SF-36) in terms of gender, age, occupation and income level. Results: Although the prevalence of depression was 18.5% and anxiety was 24.5%, sleep quality was poor in 69.5% of the participants. BDI, BAI (p&lt;0.01) and PSQI scores were significantly higher in females, whereas SF-36 scores were low (p&lt;0.05). BDI and BAI scores were high in the 31-40 age group (p=0.006, p=0.023);SF-36 scores, however, were low (p=0.016). No difference by age in the PSQI scores was noted. Although the PSQI score was highest among healthcare workers, BDI score was highest among students. No difference in BAI and SF-36 scores was recorded by profession. BDI (p&lt;0.05), BAI and PSQI scores of the highincome group were lower whereas SF-36 scores were higher (p&lt;0.01). Conclusion: In the COVID-19 pandemic, sleep quality deteriorated, and the frequency of depression and anxiety increased. This is particularly associated with the females and the young (&lt;40 years old);however, an inverse relationship was noted with those with a high-income status, and the sleep quality of healthcare workers has become worse.

272740,Characterizing Discourse about COVID-19 Vaccines: A Reddit Version of the Pandemic Story,2021-01-15,"BackgroundOn July 30, 2021, a third (booster) dose of the Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine was approved in Israel for individuals 60 years or older who had been fully vaccinated (i.e., received two doses) at least five months previously. Here, we estimate the reduction in relative risk for confirmed infection and severe COVID-19 provided by the booster dose. Methods1,144,690 individuals aged 60y and older who were eligible for a booster dose were followed between July 30 and August 22, 2021. We defined dynamic cohorts where individuals initially belong to the non-booster cohort, leave it when receiving the booster dose and join the booster cohort 12 days later. Rates of infection and severe COVID-19 outcomes per person-days at risk were compared between the cohorts using Poisson regression, adjusting for possible confounding factors. ResultsTwelve days or more after the booster dose we found an 11.4-fold (95% CI: [10.0, 12.9]) decrease in the relative risk of confirmed infection, and a >10-fold decrease in the relative risk of severe illness. Under a conservative sensitivity analysis, we find {approx}5-fold protection against confirmed infection. ConclusionsIn conjunction with safety reports, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of a third vaccine dose in both reducing transmission and severe disease and indicates the great potential of curtailing the Delta variant resurgence by administering booster shots.","Bar-On, Yinon M.; Goldberg, Yair; Mandel, Micha; Bodenheimer, Omri; Freedman, Laurence; Kalkstein, Nir; Mizrahi, Barak; Alroy-Preis, Sharon; Ash, Nachman; Milo, Ron; Huppert, Amit",,,476

Formative work from Cleveland&McGill has shown that position along a common axis is the most effective visual variable for comparing individual values. One natural conclusion is that any chart that is not a dot plot or scatterplot is deficient and should be avoided. In this paper we refute a caricature of this""scatterplots only""argument as a way to call for new perspectives on how information visualization is researched, taught, and evaluated.","Bertini, Enrico; Correll, Michael; Franconeri, Steven",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.11310v2.pdf,476

273076,"Rekombinante, vollständig humane Antikörper zur Behandlung akuter COVID-19",2020,"BACKGROUND: Health research is important for the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. However, there are many challenges facing health research, including securing sufficient funds, building capacity, producing research findings and using both local and global evidence, and avoiding waste. A WHO initiative addressed these challenges by developing a conceptual framework with four functions to guide the development of national health research systems. Despite some progress, more is needed before health research systems can meet their full potential of improving health systems. The WHO Regional Office for Europe commissioned an evidence synthesis of the systems-level literature. This Opinion piece considers its findings before reflecting on the vast additional literature available on the range of specific health research system functions related to the various challenges. Finally, it considers who should lead research system strengthening. MAIN TEXT: The evidence synthesis identifies two main approaches for strengthening national health research systems, namely implementing comprehensive and coherent strategies and participation in partnerships. The literature describing these approaches at the systems level also provides data on ways to strengthen each of the four functions of governance, securing financing, capacity-building, and production and use of research. Countries effectively implementing strategies include England, Ireland and Rwanda, whereas West Africa experienced effective partnerships. Recommended policy approaches for system strengthening are context specific. The vast literature on each function and the ever-growing evidence-base are illustrated by considering papers in just one key journal, Health Research Policy and Systems, and analysing the contribution of two national studies. A review of the functions of the Iranian system identifies over 200 relevant and mostly national records; an analysis of the creation of the English National Institute for Health Research describes the key leadership role played by the health department. Furthermore, WHO is playing leadership roles in helping coordinate partnerships within and across health research systems that have been attempting to tackle the COVID-19 crisis. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence synthesis provides a firm basis for decision-making by policy-makers and research leaders looking to strengthen national health research systems within their own national context. It identifies five crucial policy approaches - conducting situation analysis, sustaining a comprehensive strategy, engaging stakeholders, evaluating impacts on health systems, and partnership participation. The vast and ever-growing additional literature could provide further perspectives, including on crucial leadership roles for health ministries.","Hanney, Stephen R; Kanya, Lucy; Pokhrel, Subhash; Jones, Teresa H; Boaz, Annette",Health Res Policy Syst,,476

273948,Virtual hackathon to tackle COVID-19 unmet needs,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may trigger severe pneumonia in coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) patients through release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and recruitment of neutrophils in the lungs. Activated neutrophils induce inflammation and severe alveolar injury by releasing neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). The backbones of many DAMPs and NETs are made of extracellular, cell-free DNA decorated with highly toxic compounds such as elastase, myeloperoxidase and citrullinated histones. Dornase alfa is a FDA-approved recombinant human DNAse 1 for the treatment of cystic fibrosis, which cleaves extracellular DNA and may break up cell-free DNA, loosening sticky mucus in the distal airways and reducing NETs-induced toxicity on alveolar pneumocytes. The COVIDornase trial intends to define the impact of aerosolized intra-tracheal dornase alfa administration on the severity and progression of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in COVID-19 patients. This drug might make lung mucus thinner and looser, promoting improved clearance of secretions and reduce extracellular double-stranded DNA-induced hyperinflammation in alveoli, preventing further damage to the lungs. TRIAL DESIGN: COVIDornase is a prospective, randomized, controlled, 2-arm (1:1 ratio), multicentric, open-label clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: The study will recruit mechanically ventilated patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU) in the recruiting centres (at the time of writing: The Rothschild foundation hospital in Paris, the Strasbourg university hospitals, and Metz-Thionville hospital) who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and meet ARDS criteria. INCLUSION CRITERIA: - Adult patient (age &#8805; 18 years old); - Hospitalized in ICU; - With severe COVID-19 pneumonia and ARDS according to Berlin criteria (PaO2/FiO2 < 300 and PEEP > 5 cmH2O); - Intubated for less than 8 days; - With an anticipated duration of mechanical ventilation > 48 hours; - Carrier of an arterial catheter; - For whom 4 PaO2/FiO2 values over the preceding 24 hours are available; NON-INCLUSION CRITERIA: - Known hypersensitivity to dornase alfa or any of its excipients; - Pregnant or breastfeeding status; - Patient under legal protection. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Intervention 1, Study group Dornase alfa (Pulmozyme®, Roche, Switzerland) will be administered by aerosol, at a dose of 2500 IU twice daily, 12 hours apart, for 7 consecutive days, using a vibrating mesh nebulizer (Aerogen Solo®, Aerogen, Ireland). The remainder of the management will be performed in accordance with good clinical practice, including mechanical ventilation (protective ventilation, PEEP > 5 cmH2O, tracheal balloon pressure check every 4 hours or automatic device, 30° head of the bed elevation, tidal volume 6-8mL/kg, plateau pressure < 30 cmH2O), neuromuscular blockers if necessary, prone position if PaO2/FiO2 < 150, early enteral nutrition, glycemic control and a sedation protocol based on the RASS score. Intervention 2, Comparator Patients will receive usual care in accordance with good practice (as detailed above), without aerosols. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome is the occurrence of at least one grade improvement between D0 (inclusion) and D7 in the ARDS scale severity (Berlin criteria). For instance from ""severe"" to ""moderate"" or from ""moderate"" to ""mild"". RANDOMISATION: All consecutive patients meeting the inclusion criteria will be randomised 1:1 using an eCRF-based, computer-generated randomisation table, either to the dornase alfa arm or to the control arm. An interim analysis will be performed after inclusion of 20 patients. Inclusions may be stopped at the interim analysis per data safety and monitoring board (DSMB) advice, if statistical analyses conclude on the futility or efficacy of the intervention or by other DSMB decision. BLINDING (MASKING): The participants and caregivers will not be blinded to study group assignment. Those assessing the outcomes will be blinded to study group assignment. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): Fifty patients will be randomized to each group, 100 patients in total. TRIAL STATUS: Protocol version number 2, April 29th, 2020. Recruitment is ongoing. The trial started recruitment on the 21st April 2020. We estimate recruitment will finish August 21st 2020.

273951,Heuristic Thinking and Altruism towards Machines in People Impacted by Covid-19,2021,"Purpose: With the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe in March 2020, higher education institutions (HEIs) worldwide were confronted with creating online courses to complete the semester. While emphasizing positive elements such as flexibility and innovative solutions, the literature focused on numerous faculty problems such as online fatigue, emotional well-being and stress. This paper aims to explore faculty perceptions of teaching during the exceptional circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: Two surveys, in the first week and at the end of the semester, were conducted at a business school in Switzerland via the program Lima. A total of 19 faculty members participated in the survey. Of the participants, 56.7% responded in the first survey and 70.9% responded in the second. Findings: The findings revealed that the faculty’s impressions of their online courses remained positive. The most significant issue cited was time. According to faculty estimations, more than ten additional hours per week were spent preparing for online courses. Nonetheless, many faculty members reported interest in continuing online practices in their future courses. Practical implications: The COVID-19 pandemic pushed HEIs to embrace the digital revolution while teaching in a competence-oriented mode. However, moving forward, HEIs must mitigate the long-term effects by careful planning and evaluating their digital readiness as an institution and offering training for their faculty and students when necessary. Originality/value: The study contributes to the existing literature by analyzing one stakeholder group, i.e. faculty members, and their perceptions of teaching during a worldwide pandemic. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Zizka, L.; Probst, G.",Journal of International Education in Business,,476
274261,"Multilevel Analysis of Personal, Non-Medical COVID-19-Related Impact Worldwide",2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has increasingly disrupted the global delivery of preventive health care services, as a large number of governments have issued state of emergency orders halting service delivery. However, there is limited evidence on the realized effects of the pandemic and associated emergency orders on access to services in low-income country contexts to date. To address this gap, this paper analyzes administrative data on utilization of contraceptive health services by women referred via community health promoters in two large urban and peri-urban areas of Mozambique. We focus on the period immediately surrounding the national state of emergency declaration linked to the COVID-19 pandemic on March 31, 2020. Data reported for 109,129 women served by 132 unique promoters and 192 unique public health facilities is analyzed using logistic regression, interrupted time series analysis and hazard analysis. The results demonstrate that the imposition of the state of emergency is associated with a modest short-term drop in both service provision and utilization, followed by a relatively rapid rebound. We conclude that in this context, the accessibility of reproductive health services was not dramatically reduced during the first phase of the pandemic-related emergency.","Leight, Jessica; Hensly, Catherine; Chissano, Marcos; Ali, Liza",PLoS One,,476

However, the merits of broadly targeting S versus focusing antibody onto the smaller receptor binding domain (RBD) are unclear. Here we assess prototypic S and RBD subunit vaccines in homologous or heterologous prime-boost regimens in mice and non-human primates. We find S is highly immunogenic in mice, while the comparatively poor immunogenicity of RBD is associated with limiting germinal centre and T follicular helper cell activity. Boosting S-primed mice with either S or RBD significantly augments neutralising titres, with RBD-focussing driving moderate improvement in serum neutralisation. In contrast, both S and RBD vaccines are comparably immunogenic in macaques, eliciting serological neutralising activity that generally exceed levels in convalescent humans. These studies confirm recombinant S proteins as promising vaccine candidates and highlight multiple pathways to achieving potent serological neutralisation.","Tan, Hyon-Xhi; Juno, Jennifer A; Lee, Wen Shi; Barber-Axthelm, Isaac; Kelly, Hannah G; Wragg, Kathleen M; Esterbauer, Robyn; Amarasena, Thakshila; Mordant, Francesca L; Subbarao, Kanta; Kent, Stephen J; Wheatley, Adam K",Nat Commun,,476

The Woven EndoBridge (WEB) device is an intrasaccular braided device, recently approved by the FDA for treatment of WNBAs. While treatment of intracranial aneurysms with the WEB device has been shown to yield an adequate occlusion rate of 85% at 1 year, few data have been published for patients with ruptured aneurysms. OBJECTIVE: To present a multi-institutional series depicting the safety and efficacy of using the WEB device as the primary treatment modality in ruptured intracranial aneurysms. METHODS: A multi-institutional retrospective analysis was conducted, assessing patients presenting with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage treated with the WEB between January 2014 and April 2020. Baseline demographics, aneurysm characteristics, adverse events, and long-term outcomes (occlusion, re-treatment, functional status) were collected. A descriptive analysis was performed, and variables potentially associated with aneurysm recurrence or re-treatment were assessed. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients were included. Anterior communicating artery aneurysms were the most common (35.4%) location for treatment, followed by middle cerebral artery (20.8%) and basilar apex (16.7%). Procedural success was noted in 95.8% of patients, and clinically significant periprocedural adverse events occurred in 12.5%. After a median follow-up of 5.5 months, 54.2% of patients had follow-up angiographic imaging. Complete occlusion was seen in 61.5% of cases with adequate occlusion in 92.3%. Re-treatment was required in only 4.2% of patients during the study period. Tobacco use was significantly higher in patients with aneurysm recurrence (88.9% vs 35.7%; p=0.012). No other characteristics were associated with recurrence/re-treatment. At 30 days, 81.1% were functionally independent (modified Rankin Scale score &#8804;2). CONCLUSION: Treatment of acutely ruptured aneurysms with the WEB device demonstrates both safety and efficacy on par with rates of conventional treatment strategies.","Youssef, Patrick P; Dornbos Iii, David; Peterson, Jeremy; Sweid, Ahmad; Zakeri, Amanda; Nimjee, Shahid M; Jabbour, Pascal; Arthur, Adam S",J. neurointerv. surg.

275904,Legal empowerment approaches in the context of COVID-19,2020,"This paper provides evidence of the importance of size in explaining the impact of financing conditions on firms´ investment rate. The study makes two main contributions: a) it allows the relationship between indebtedness and firms´ investment to be non-linear;and b) it contrasts whether the impact of indebtedness and the degree of financial restriction differ depending on the size of the company (SME vs large). Results show that while in SMEs indebtedness has a negative impact on investment, there is a threshold beyond which this effect is even larger (based on a debt/assets ratio of 59%). However, in large companies the impact of indebtedness is positive although there is also a threshold (36.5%) from which the effect becomes negative and investment decreases. In the case of financial restrictions, investment decreases as the degree of financial restriction increases, but in SMEs the penalty is higher. From an economic impact perspective, the degree of financial constraints is much higher than that of indebtedness. These results highlight the importance of designing specific measures to improve conditions of access to financing for SMEs. This is even more important in the current context of the COVID-19 crisis, which is having a greater impact on smaller, less resilient firms.","de Guevara, Juan Fernández Maudos Joaquín Salvador Carlos",Finance Research Letters,,476
275999,Discontinuation Syndrome of Extended-Release Venlafaxine during the COVID-19 Epidemic,2021,"The prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has increased significantly over the last few decades mirroring the increase in obesity and type II diabetes mellitus. NAFLD has become one of the most common indications for liver transplantation. The deleterious effects of NAFLD are not isolated to the liver only, for it has been recognized as a systemic disease affecting multiple organs through protracted low-grade inflammation mediated by the metabolic activity of excessive fat tissue. Extrahepatic manifestations of NAFLD such as cardiovascular disease, polycystic ovarian syndrome, chronic kidney disease, and hypothyroidism have been well described in the literature. In recent years, it has become evident that patients suffering from NAFLD might be at higher risk of developing various infections. The proposed mechanism for this association includes links through hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, alterations in innate immunity, obesity, and vitamin D deficiency. Additionally, a risk independent of these factors mediated by alterations in gut microbiota might contribute to a higher burden of infections in these individuals. In this narrative review, we synthetize current knowledge on several infections including urinary tract infection, pneumonia, Helicobacter pylori, coronavirus disease 2019, and Clostridioides difficile as they relate to NAFLD. Additionally, we explore NAFLD's association with hidradenitis suppurativa.","Adenote, Abimbola; Dumic, Igor; Madrid, Cristian; Barusya, Christopher; Nordstrom, Charles W; Rueda Prada, Libardo",Can J Gastroenterol Hepatol,,476

Our objective was to determine the odds of critical illness and duration of mechanical ventilation in patients with prior cerebrovascular disease and COVID-19. Methods: A observational study of 1,128 consecutive adult patients admitted to an academic center in Boston, Massachusetts, and diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. We tested the association between prior cerebrovascular disease and critical illness, defined as mechanical ventilation (MV) or death by day 28, using logistic regression with inverse probability weighting of the propensity score. Among intubated patients, we estimated the cumulative incidence of successful extubation without death over 45 days using competing risk analysis. Results: Of the 1,128 adults with COVID-19, 350 (36%) were critically ill by day 28. The median age of patients was 59 years (SD: 18 years) and 640 (57%) were men. As of June 2nd, 2020, 127 (11%) patients had died. A total of 177 patients (16%) had a prior cerebrovascular disease. Prior cerebrovascular disease was significantly associated with critical illness (OR = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.14-2.07), lower rate of successful extubation (cause-specific HR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.33-0.98), and increased duration of intubation (restricted mean time difference = 4.02 days, 95% CI = 0.34-10.92) compared to patients without cerebrovascular disease.

277826,COVID-19 human challenge trials – what research ethics committees need to consider,2020,"Respiratorytract infections (RTIs) are frequent and life-threatening diseases, accounting for several millions of deaths worldwide. RTIs implicate microorganisms, including viruses (influenza virus, coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)), bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus anthracis) and fungi (Pneumocystis spp., Aspergillus spp. and very occasionally Candida spp.). The emergence of new pathogens, like the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, and the substantial increase in drug resistance have highlighted the critical necessity to develop novel anti-infective molecules. In this context, antibodies (Abs) are becoming increasingly important in respiratory medicine and may fulfill the unmet medical needs of RTIs. However, development of Abs for treating infectious diseases is less advanced than for cancer and inflammatory diseases. Currently, only three Abs have been marketed for RTIs, namely, against pulmonary anthrax and RSV infection, while several clinical and preclinical studies are in progress. This article gives an overview of the advances in the use of Abs for the treatment of RTIs, based on the analysis of clinical studies in this field.

277850,An example of regional “sacred union” between the public and private sector against COVID-19/ L'union sacrée entre l'hôpital public et le privé face à la pandémie COVID-19: un exemple régional,2020,"Importance: Safe reduction of the cesarean delivery rate is a national priority. Objective: To evaluate the rates of cesarean delivery for nulliparous, term, singleton, vertex (NTSV) births in California in the context of a statewide multifaceted intervention designed to reduce the rates of cesarean delivery. Design, Setting, and Participants: Observational study of cesarean delivery rates from 2014 to 2019 among 7â¯574â¯889 NTSV births in the US and at 238 nonmilitary hospitals providing maternity services in California. From 2016 to 2019, California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative partnered with Smart Care California to implement multiple approaches to decrease the rates of cesarean delivery. Hospitals with rates of cesarean delivery greater than 23.9% for NTSV births were invited to join 1 of 3 cohorts for an 18-month quality improvement collaborative between July 2016 and June 2019. Exposures: Within the collaborative, multidisciplinary teams implemented multiple strategies supported by mentorship, shared learning, and rapid-cycle data feedback. Partnerships among nonprofit organizations, state governmental agencies, purchasers, and health plans addressed the external environment through transparency, award programs, and incentives. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the change in cesarean delivery rates for NTSV births in California and a difference-in-differences analysis was performed to compare cesarean delivery rates for NTSV births in California vs the rates in the rest of the US. A mixed multivariable logistic regression model that adjusted for patient-level and hospital-level confounders also was used to assess the collaborative and the external statewide actions. The cesarean delivery rates for NTSV births at hospitals participating in the collaborative were compared with the rates from the nonparticipating hospitals and the rates in the participating hospitals prior to participation in the collaborative. Results: A total of 7â¯574â¯889 NTSV births occurred in the US from 2014 to 2019, of which 914â¯283 were at 238 hospitals in California. All California hospitals were exposed to the statewide actions to reduce the rates of cesarean delivery, including the 149 hospitals that had baseline rates of cesarean delivery greater than 23.9% for NTSV births, of which 91 (61%) participated in the quality improvement collaborative. The rate of cesarean delivery for NTSV births in California decreased from 26.0% (95% CI, 25.8%-26.2%) in 2014 to 22.8% (95% CI, 22.6%-23.1%) in 2019 (relative risk, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.87-0.89). The rate of cesarean delivery for NTSV births in the US (excluding California births) was 26.0% in both 2014 and 2019 (relative risk, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.996-1.005). The difference-in-differences analysis revealed that the reduction in the rate of cesarean delivery for NTSV births in California was 3.2% (95% CI, 1.7%-3.5%) higher than in the US (excluding California). Compared with the hospitals and the periods not exposed to the collaborative activities, and after adjusting for patient characteristics and time using a modified stepped-wedge analysis, exposure to collaborative activities was associated with a lower odds of cesarean delivery for NTSV births (24.4% vs 24.6%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.85-0.89]). Conclusions and Relevance: In this observational study of NTSV births in California from 2014 to 2019, the rates of cesarean delivery decreased over time in the setting of the implementation of a coordinated hospital-level collaborative and statewide initiatives designed to support vaginal birth.","Rosenstein, Melissa G; Chang, Shen-Chih; Sakowski, Christa; Markow, Cathie; Teleki, Stephanie; Lang, Lance; Logan, Julia; Cape, Valerie; Main, Elliott K",JAMA,,476

No vaccine is currently available. OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and immunogenicity of Ad26.ZIKV.001, a prophylactic ZIKV vaccine candidate. DESIGN: Phase 1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03356561). SETTING: United States. PARTICIPANTS: 100 healthy adult volunteers. INTERVENTION: Ad26.ZIKV.001, an adenovirus serotype 26 vector encoding ZIKV M-Env, administered in 1- or 2-dose regimens of 5 × 1010 or 1 × 1011 viral particles (vp), or placebo. MEASUREMENTS: Local and systemic adverse events; neutralization titers by microneutralization assay (MN50) and T-cell responses by interferon-Î³ enzyme-linked immunospot and intracellular cytokine staining; and protectivity of vaccine-induced antibodies in a subset of participants through transfer in an exploratory mouse ZIKV challenge model. RESULTS: All regimens were well tolerated, with no safety concerns identified. In both 2-dose regimens, ZIKV neutralizing titers peaked 14 days after the second vaccination, with geometric mean MN50 titers (GMTs) of 1065.6 (95% CI, 494.9 to 2294.5) for 5 × 1010 vp and 956.6 (595.8 to 1535.8) for 1 × 1011 vp. Titers persisted for at least 1 year at a GMT of 68.7 (CI, 26.4-178.9) for 5 × 1010 vp and 87.0 (CI, 29.3 to 258.6) for 1 × 1011 vp. A 1-dose regimen of 1 × 1011 vp Ad26.ZIKV.001 induced seroconversion in all participants 56 days after the first vaccination (GMT, 103.4 [CI, 52.7 to 202.9]), with titers persisting for at least 1 year (GMT, 90.2 [CI, 38.4 to 212.2]). Env-specific cellular responses were induced. Protection against ZIKV challenge was observed after antibody transfer from participants into mice, and MN50 titers correlated with protection in this model. LIMITATION: The study was conducted in a nonendemic area, so it did not assess safety and immunogenicity in a flavivirus-exposed population. CONCLUSION: The safety and immunogenicity profile makes Ad26.ZIKV.001 a promising candidate for further development if the need reemerges.

(Special Issue: Pandemic econometrics.),2021,"The p53 transcription factor confers its potent tumor suppressor functions primarily through the regulation of a large network of target genes. The recent explosion of next generation sequencing protocols has enabled the study of the p53 gene regulatory network (GRN) and underlying mechanisms at an unprecedented depth and scale, helping us to understand precisely how p53 controls gene regulation. Here, we discuss our current understanding of where and how p53 binds to DNA and chromatin, its pioneer-like role, and how this affects gene regulation. We provide an overview of the p53 GRN and the direct and indirect mechanisms through which p53 affects gene regulation. In particular, we focus on delineating the ubiquitous and cell type-specific network of regulatory elements that p53 engages; reviewing our understanding of how, where, and when p53 binds to DNA and the mechanisms through which these events regulate transcription. Finally, we discuss the evolution of the p53 GRN and how recent work has revealed remarkable differences between vertebrates, which are of particular importance to cancer researchers using mouse models.","Sammons, Morgan A; Nguyen, Thuy-Ai T; McDade, Simon S; Fischer, Martin",Nucleic acids res,,476

COVID-19 is a new additional and immediate risk to a patient’s morbidity and mortality and there is a need for an accurate assessment as to the potential impact on of this syndrome on GU cancer patients. The aim of this work was to develop a risk tool to identify GU cancer patients at risk of diagnosis, hospitalization, intubation, and mortality from COVID-19. A retrospective case showed a series of GU cancer patients screened for COVID-19 across the Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS). Four hundred eighty-four had a GU malignancy and 149 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Demographic and clinical variables of &gt;38,000 patients were available in the institutional database and were utilized to develop decision aides to predict a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, as well as COVID-19-related hospitalization, intubation, and death. A risk tool was developed using a combination of machine learning methods and utilized BMI, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation. The risk tool for predicting a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 had an AUC of 0.83, predicting hospitalization for management of COVID-19 had an AUC of 0.95, predicting patients requiring intubation had an AUC of 0.97, and for predicting COVID-19-related death, the risk tool had an AUC of 0.79. The models had an acceptable calibration and provided a superior net benefit over other common strategies across the entire range of threshold probabilities.","Lundon, Dara J.; Kelly, Brian D.; Shukla, Devki; Bolton, Damien M.; Wiklund, Peter; Tewari, Ash",J.

278734,Hydroxychloroquine in a G6PD-Deficient Patient with COVID-19 Complicated by Haemolytic Anaemia: Culprit or Innocent Bystander?,2020,"Pneumonia refers to a death-causing infection. Astragali Radix (AR) and Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma (AMR) are widely used as traditional tonic and promising edible immunomodulatory herbal medicine, but the systemic mechanism is not well understood. Therefore, a strategy based on network pharmacology and molecular docking was designed to explore the systemic mechanism of AR-AMR acting on pneumonia. After a series of bioinformatics assays, seven kernel targets were obtained, including TNF, IL6, IFNG, IL1B, IL10, IL4, and TLR9. And seven key compounds were identified as the synergy components of AR-AMR acting on pneumonia, the four key compounds belonging to AR were (3R)-3-(2-hydroxy-3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-7-chromanol, formononetin, quercetin, and kaempferol, the three key compounds belonging to AMR were atractylone, 14-acetyl-12-senecioyl-2E, 8E, 10E-atractylentriol, and &#945;-Amyrin. The crucial pathways were mainly related to three modules, including immune diseases, infectious disease, and organismal systems. Collectively, these observations strongly suggest that the molecular mechanisms of AR-AMR regulating pneumonia were closely related to the correlation between inflammation and immune response. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Astragali radix and Atractylodis macrocephalae rhizoma can be used as ""medicine-food homology"" for dietary supplement. AR and AMR are widely used as a traditional tonic and promising edible immunomodulatory herbal medicine. The AR-AMR herb pairs are used for compatibility many times in the recommended prescriptions in COVID-19 develop pneumonia in China. However, the ingredients and mechanisms of AR-AMR acting on Pneumonia via immunomodulation are unclear. In this paper, bioinformatics and network biology were used to systematically explore the mechanisms of the AR-AMR herb pairs in treatment of pneumonia, and further analyze the correlation mechanism between it and COVID-19 develop pneumonia. To sum up, our study reveals the interrelationships between components, targets, and corresponding biological processes of AR-AMR acting on pneumonia. Understanding these relationships may provide guidance and theoretical basis for the further application of AR-AMR herb pairs.","Wu, Qiguo; Hu, Yeqing",J Food Biochem,,476
279073,Telehealth in Times of COVID-19: Spotlight on Austria,2021,"BACKGROUND: Mental health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic have been observed. Psychiatric symptoms in people living with HIV (PLWH), and their relationship to physical symptomatology and prior psychopathology, are not yet reported. SETTING: An HIV cohort sheltering-in-place in New York City (NYC). METHODS: Forty-nine participants in a longitudinal study were contacted by telephone in April 2020. A structured interview queried COVID-19-associated physical symptoms, and mental health screens were performed with the generalized anxiety disorder-2 (GAD-2) and patient health questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2). Prior medical and neuropsychiatric data were obtained from preceding study visits. Post hoc analyses were performed. RESULTS: The mean age of respondents was 62.1 years, 39% were women, and 35% African American, 37% Latinx, and 28% Caucasian. COVID-19-indicator symptoms were present in 69%; 41% had respiratory and 61% extra-pulmonary symptoms. Mental health symptoms were endorsed in 45% with PHQ-2 and 43% with GAD-2, although threshold for major depression was met in only 4% and for GAD in 14%. Higher PHQ scores were associated with respiratory symptoms, but not prior mood or anxiety disorders. GAD-2 scores were higher with past mood disorders, but not with prior anxiety disorders or respiratory symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Physical symptoms were frequent and mild psychiatric symptoms common, but serious anxiety and depression were not often endorsed by this group of PLWH at the acute height of the NYC COVID-19 pandemic. Reasons for this are unclear, as this preliminary report is descriptive in nature. Short and long term consequences of acute mental health symptoms require further study.","Pizzirusso, Maria; Carrion-Park, Cira; Clark, Uraina S; Gonzalez, Jairo; Byrd, Desiree; Morgello, Susan",J. acquir. immune defic. syndr,,476

Global public interest in this new issue largely reflects people's attention to COVID-19 and their willingness to take precautionary actions. This study aimed to examine global public awareness of COVID-19 using Google Trends. Methods: Using Google Trends, we retrieved public query data for terms of ""2019-nCoV + SARS-CoV-2 + novel coronavirus + new coronavirus + COVID-19 + Corona Virus Disease 2019"" between the 31st December 2019 and the 24th February 2020 in six major English-speaking countries, including the USA, the UK, Canada, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand. Dynamic series analysis demonstrates the overall change trend of relative search volume (RSV) for the topic on COVID-19. We compared the top-ranking related queries and sub-regions distribution of RSV about COVID-19 across different countries. The correlation between daily search volumes on the topic related to COVID-19 and the daily number of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 was analyzed. Results: The overall search trend of RSV regarding COVID-19 increased during the early period of observing time and reached the first apex on 31st January 2020. A shorter response time and a longer duration of public attention to COVID-19 was observed in public from the USA, the UK, Australia, and Canada, than that in Ireland and New Zealand. A slightly positive correlation between daily RSV about COVID-19 and the daily number of confirmed cases was observed (P < 0.05). People across countries presented a various interest to the RSV on COVID-19, and public awareness of COVID-19 was different in various sub-regions within countries. Conclusions: The results suggest that public response time to COVID-19 was different across countries, and the overall duration of public attention was short. The current study reminds us that governments should strengthen the publicity of COVID-19 nationally, strengthen the public's vigilance and sensitivity to COVID-19, inform public the importance of protecting themselves with enough precautionary measures, and finally control the spread of COVID-19 globally.","Hu, Dingtao; Lou, Xiaoqi; Xu, Zhiwei; Meng, Nana; Xie, Qiaomei; Zhang, Man; Zou, Yanfeng; Liu, Jiatao; Sun, Guoping; Wang, Fang",J Glob Health,,476

The aim of this article is to familiarize the treating physician with the imaging spectrum of the coronavirus lung infection on X-ray and to discuss the frequency of these findings. A total of 593 radiographs of admitted COVID-19 patients (RT-PCR proven) were retrospectively assessed in the study. Demographics of admitted patients and COVID manifestations on chest radiographs were assessed. Male to female ratio of patients in our study was 2.1:1. The largest number of patients was in the 50 to 60-year age bracket (29%). Forty percent of the X-rays in our study were negative. No X-ray showed findings exclusively in the upper zones, and 88% showed findings in the mid-lower zones. Ground glass opacification was the commonest finding (75% of cases) in abnormal X-rays. The next most common findings were peripheral lung opacities and confluent consolidation. Confluent consolidation, which indicates more severe disease, was observed in 15% of the abnormal X-rays. The proportion of patients showing confluent consolidation was seen more in the older age groups (> 50 years old) with a peak in the 60-70-year age bracket. Small reticular opacities, pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and pleural effusions were uncommon findings in our study.","Nagarajan, Bhagyam; Autkar, Gayatri; Monga, Aarav; Toshniwal, Nikhil",SN Compr Clin Med,,476

Animal models, and in particular non-human primates, are essential to understand the pathogenesis of emerging diseases and to assess the safety and efficacy of novel vaccines and therapeutics. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 replicates in the upper and lower respiratory tract and causes pulmonary lesions in both rhesus and cynomolgus macaques. Immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 are also similar in both species and equivalent to those reported in milder infections and convalescent human patients. This finding is reiterated by our transcriptional analysis of respiratory samples revealing the global response to infection. We describe a new method for lung histopathology scoring that will provide a metric to enable clearer decision making for this key endpoint. In contrast to prior publications, in which rhesus are accepted to be the preferred study species, we provide convincing evidence that both macaque species authentically represent mild to moderate forms of COVID-19 observed in the majority of the human population and both species should be used to evaluate the safety and efficacy of interventions against SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, accessing cynomolgus macaques will greatly alleviate the pressures on current rhesus stocks.","Salguero, Francisco J; White, Andrew D; Slack, Gillian S; Fotheringham, Susan A; Bewley, Kevin R; Gooch, Karen E; Longet, Stephanie; Humphries, Holly E; Watson, Robert J; Hunter, Laura; Ryan, Kathryn A; Hall, Yper; Sibley, Laura; Sarfas, Charlotte; Allen, Lauren; Aram, Marilyn; Brunt, Emily; Brown, Phillip; Buttigieg, Karen R; Cavell, Breeze E; Cobb, Rebecca; Coombes, Naomi S; Darby, Alistair; Daykin-Pont, Owen; Elmore, Michael J; Garcia-Dorival, Isabel; Gkolfinos, Konstantinos; Godwin, Kerry J; Gouriet, Jade; Halkerston, Rachel; Harris, Debbie J; Hender, Thomas; Ho, Catherine M K; Kennard, Chelsea L; Knott, Daniel; Leung, Stephanie; Lucas, Vanessa; Mabbutt, Adam; Morrison, Alexandra L; Nelson, Charlotte; Ngabo, Didier; Paterson, Jemma; Penn, Elizabeth J; Pullan, Steve; Taylor, Irene; Tipton, Tom; Thomas, Stephen; Tree, Julia A; Turner, Carrie; Vamos, Edith",Nat Commun,,476

In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between perceived stress with sleep quality, insomnia, anxiety, depression and kidney function in kidney transplant recipients during the Covid-19 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A hundred-six kidney transplant recipients were enrolled. Questionnaire of ""Socio-demographics"", ""Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)"", ""Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)"", ""Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)"" and ""Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS)"" are performed. The laboratory data is recorded. The perceived stress related to Covid-19 pandemic and its associations were investigated. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 44.2±13.3 years, and 65 of the patients (61.3%) were men. Forty-nine (46.2%) of the patients had high-perceived stress; 51 (48.1%) of the patients had poor sleep quality, 40 (37.7%) of the patients had insomnia, 25 (23.6%) of the patients had anxiety and 47 (44.3%) of the patients had depression. The patients having a history of Covid-19 infection in own or closed relatives (9.09±4.17 vs 6.49±4.16, p:0.014) and the patients who have a rejection episode any of time (8.24±5.16 vs 6.37±3.57, p:0.033) have had significantly higher anxiety scores, when they compared to others. The high PSS were positively correlated with PSQI, ISI, HAD-A and HAD-D. Regression analyses revealed that high-perceived stress is an independent predictor of anxiety and depression. There was not significant difference between kidney function with PSS, PSQI, ISI, HAD-A and HAD-D. CONCLUSIONS: High PSS is positively correlated with poor sleep quality and insomnia and also an independent predictor of anxiety and depression in kidney transplant recipients during the outbreak of Covid-19. As the pandemic is still spreading worldwide quickly early identification and intervention of sleep disturbances and psychiatric disorders are essential to protect graft function with high compliance to treatment in transplantation patients.","Barutcu Atas, Dilek; Aydin Sunbul, Esra; Velioglu, Arzu; Tuglular, Serhan",PLoS One,,476

280448,Leadership under Crises: A Research Agenda for the Post-COVID-19 Era,2020,"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) disease caused more than 100,000,000 people get infected and over 2,200,000 people being killed worldwide. However, the current developed vaccines or drugs may be not effective in preventing the pandemic of COVID-19 due to the mutations of coronavirus and the severe side effects of the newly developed vaccines. Chinese herbal medicines and their active components play important antiviral activities. Corilagin exhibited antiviral effect on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). However, whether it blocks the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and hACE2 has not been elucidated. PURPOSE: To characterize an active compound, corilagin derived from Phyllanthus urinaria as potential SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors for its possible preventive application in daily anti-virus hygienic products. METHODS: Computational docking coupled with bio-layer interferometry, BLI were adopted to screen more than 1800 natural compounds for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 spike-RBD inhibitors. Corilagin was confirmed to have a strong binding affinity with SARS-CoV-2-RBD or human ACE2 (hACE2) protein by the BLI, ELISA and immunocytochemistry (ICC) assay. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of viral infection of corilagin was assessed by in vitro pseudovirus system. Finally, the toxicity of corilagin was examined by using MTT assay and maximal tolerated dose (MTD) studies in C57BL/6 mice. RESULTS: Corilagin preferentially binds to a pocket that contains residues Cys 336 to Phe 374 of spike-RBD with a relatively low binding energy of -9.4 kcal/mol. BLI assay further confirmed that corilagin exhibits a relatively strong binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2-RBD and hACE2 protein. In addition, corilagin dose-dependently blocks SARS-CoV-2-RBD binding and abolishes the infectious property of RBD-pseudotyped lentivirus in hACE2 overexpressing HEK293 cells, which mimicked the entry of SARS-CoV-2 virus in human host cells. Finally, in vivo studies revealed that up to 300 mg/kg/day of corilagin was safe in C57BL/6 mice. Our findings suggest that corilagin could be a safe and potential antiviral agent against the COVID-19 acting through the blockade of the fusion of SARS-CoV-2 spike-RBD to hACE2 receptors. CONCLUSION: Corilagin could be considered as a safe and environmental friendly anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent for its potential preventive application in daily anti-virus hygienic products.","Yang, Li Jun; Chen, Rui Hong; Hamdoun, Sami; Coghi, Paolo; Ng, Jerome P L; Zhang, David Wei; Guo, Xiaoling; Xia, Chenglai; Law, Betty Yuen Kwan; Wong, Vincent Kam Wai",Phytomedicine,,476

It is believed that Th17 cells also play a central role in the induction of autoimmune diseases. Recent advances have evaluated Th17 effector functions during viral infections, including their critical role in the production and induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and in the recruitment and activation of other immune cells. Thus, Th17 is involved in the induction both of pathogenicity and immunoprotective mechanisms seen in the host's immune response against viruses. However, certain Th17 cells can also modulate immune responses, since they can secrete immunosuppressive factors, such as IL-10; these cells are called non-pathogenic Th17 cells. Here, we present a brief review of Th17 cells and highlight their involvement in some virus infections. We cover these notions by highlighting the role of Th17 cells in regulating the protective and pathogenic immune response in the context of viral infections. In addition, we will be describing myocarditis and multiple sclerosis as examples of immune diseases triggered by viral infections, in which we will discuss further the roles of Th17 cells in the induction of tissue damage.","Paiva, Iury Amancio; Badolato-Corrêa, Jéssica; Familiar-Macedo, Débora; de-Oliveira-Pinto, Luzia Maria",,,476

The disease outcome largely depends on the immune response produced by the host. The bio-molecular mechanisms underlying certain dire consequences of the infection partly arise from an aberrant production of inflammatory molecules, an event denoted as ""cytokine storm"". Therefore, in addition to antiviral therapies, molecules able to prevent the injury caused by cytokine excess are under investigation. In this perspective, taking advantage of melanocortin peptides and their receptors, components of an endogenous modulatory system that exerts marked anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory influences, could be an effective therapeutic strategy to control disease evolution. Exploiting the melanocortin system using natural or synthetic ligands can form a realistic basis to counteract certain deleterious effects of respiratory virus infections. The central and peripheral protective actions exerted following melanocortin receptor activation could allow dampening the harmful events that trigger the cytokine storm and endothelial dysfunction while sustaining the beneficial signals required to elicit repair mechanisms. The long standing evidence for melanocortin safety encourages this approach.","Lonati, Caterina; Gatti, Stefano; Catania, Anna",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),,476

Maternity care disruptions have been surveyed, but not those related to vulnerable small newborns. We aimed to survey reported disruptions to small and sick newborn care worldwide and undertake thematic analysis of healthcare providers' experiences and proposed mitigation strategies. METHODS: Using a widely disseminated online survey in three languages, we reached out to neonatal healthcare providers. We collected data on COVID-19 preparedness, effects on health personnel and on newborn care services, including kangaroo mother care (KMC), as well as disruptors and solutions. RESULTS: We analysed 1120 responses from 62 countries, mainly low and middle-income countries (LMICs). Preparedness for COVID-19 was suboptimal in terms of guidelines and availability of personal protective equipment. One-third reported routine testing of all pregnant women, but 13% had no testing capacity at all. More than 85% of health personnel feared for their own health and 89% had increased stress. Newborn care practices were disrupted both due to reduced care-seeking and a compromised workforce. More than half reported that evidence-based interventions such as KMC were discontinued or discouraged. Separation of the mother-baby dyad was reported for both COVID-positive mothers (50%) and those with unknown status (16%). Follow-up care was disrupted primarily due to families' fear of visiting hospitals (~73%). CONCLUSION: Newborn care providers are stressed and there is lack clarity and guidelines regarding care of small newborns during the pandemic. There is an urgent need to protect life-saving interventions, such as KMC, threatened by the pandemic, and to be ready to recover and build back better.","Rao, Suman P N; Minckas, Nicole; Medvedev, Melissa M; Gathara, David; Y N, Prashantha; Seifu Estifanos, Abiy; Silitonga, Alfrida Camelia; Jadaun, Arun Singh; Adejuyigbe, Ebunoluwa A; Brotherton, Helen; Arya, Sugandha; Gera, Rani; Ezeaka, Chinyere V; Gai, Abdou; Gobezayehu, Abebe Gebremariam; Dube, Queen; Kumar, Aarti; Naburi, Helga; Chiume, Msandeni; Tumukunde, Victor; Medhanyie, Araya Abrha; Plange-Rhule, Gyikua; Shabini, Josephine; Ohuma, Eric O; Tadele, Henok; WGebriel, Fitsum; Hadgu, Amanuel; Alamineh, Lamesgin; Mehta, Rajesh; Molyneux, Elizabeth; Lawn, Joy E",,,476

It is, however, a very challenging task as it must be able to handle low-quality images of real world settings and fulfill real time requirements. Deep learning approaches for face detection have proven to be very successful but they require large computation power and processing time. In this work, we evaluate the speed-accuracy tradeoff of three popular deep-learning-based face detectors on the WIDER Face and UFDD data sets in several CPUs and GPUs. We also develop a regression model capable to estimate the performance, both in terms of processing time and accuracy. We expect this to become a very useful tool for the end user in forensic laboratories in order to estimate the performance for different face detection options. Experimental results showed that the best speed-accuracy tradeoff is achieved with images resized to 50% of the original size in GPUs and images resized to 25% of the original size in CPUs. Moreover, performance can be estimated using multiple linear regression models with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.113, which is very promising for the forensic field.","Chaves, Deisy; Fidalgo, Eduardo; Alegre, Enrique; Alaiz-Rodríguez, Rocío; Jáñez-Martino, Francisco; Azzopardi, George",,,476

It has a heavy global burden, particularly in low-income countries. The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 pneumonia ranges from mild to critically ill cases and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. An expert panel was held and an internal protocol was developed to manage the COVID-19 induced ARDS according to WHO recommendations and NIH guidelines. Different therapeutic regimens were employed on this protocol based on the ARDS severity and the patients’ special characteristics. The mortality rate, the rate of survivors, and non-survivors were reported. Of the 231 suspected cases of COVID-19 admitted to the hospital during two weeks, 72 patients were admitted to ICU with diagnosis confirmed by RT-PCR. In total, mortality in the ICU was 25% (n = 18) among ARDS patients over two weeks. COVID-19 induced ARDS is a major concern. The rapid progression of ARDS needs specific protocol based on patients’ characteristics and rapid action.","Jamaati, Hamidreza; Dastan, Farzaneh; Tabarsi, Payam; Marjani, Majid; Saffaei, Ali; Hashemian, Seyed Mohammadreza",Iran.

The culture of virtual practice, consulting, and telemedicine, which had started several years ago, took an accelerated leap as humankind was challenged by the novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID19). The social distancing measures and lockdowns imposed in many countries left medical care providers with limited options in evaluating ambulatory patients, pushing the rapid transition to assessments via virtual platforms. In this novel arena of medical practice, which may form new norms beyond the current pandemic crisis, we found it critical to define guidelines on the recommended practice in neurotology, including remote methods in examining the vestibular and eye movement function. The proposed remote examination methods aim to reliably diagnose acute and subacute diseases of the inner-ear, brainstem, and the cerebellum. A key aim was to triage patients into those requiring urgent emergency room assessment versus non-urgent but expedited outpatient management. Physicians who had expertise in managing patients with vestibular disorders were invited to participate in the taskforce. The focus was on two topics: (1) an adequate eye movement and vestibular examination strategy using virtual platforms and (2) a decision pathway providing guidance about which patient should seek urgent medical care and which patient should have non-urgent but expedited outpatient management.","Shaikh, Aasef G; Bronstein, Adolfo; Carmona, Sergio; Cha, Yoon-Hee; Cho, Catherine; Ghasia, Fatema F; Gold, Daniel; Green, Kemar E; Helmchen, Christoph; Ibitoye, Richard T; Kattah, Jorge; Kim, Ji-Soo; Kothari, Sudhir; Manto, Mario; Seemungal, Barry M; Straumann, Dominik; Strupp, Michael; Szmulewicz, David; Tarnutzer, Alexander; Tehrani, Ali; Tilikete, Caroline; Welgampola, Miriam; Zalazar, Guillermo; Kheradmand, Amir",Cerebellum,,476

Angiotensin-converting enzyme II is homologous with, but acts antagonistically to, angiotensin-converting enzyme and has the critical function of protecting the lungs. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are major antihypertensive agents. Thus, we aimed to analyze the impact of the prevalence of preexisting hypertension on the local spread of COVID-19. METHODS: Data on SARS-CoV-2 infection and the estimated number of patients who received medical treatment on the basis of disease classification using the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (10th Revision) in each prefecture were obtained from the official Japanese notifications database. We analyzed the association between the proportion of patients with each disease and SARS-CoV-2-infection prevalence. RESULTS: The ratio of patients treated for diseases of the circulatory system, especially hypertensive disorders, per population demonstrated the most significant negative correlation with SARS-CoV-2-infection prevalence (Spearman's rank correlation, P < 0.01). Age group analysis revealed a significant negative correlation in age groups 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 75-84, and &#8805;85.

Detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA using realtime reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the most common method to confirm a case. However, these tests have suboptimal sensitivity. Objective: The objective of the study was to estimate the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and deaths in Mexico, accounting for the probabilities of false-negative tests. Methods: We used publicly available, national databases of all SARS-CoV-2 tests performed at public laboratories in Mexico between February 27 and October 31, 2020. We used the estimated probabilities of false-negative tests based on the day of clinical sample collection after symptom initiation calculated previously. With the resulting model, we estimated the corrected daily number of cases, ICU admissions, and deaths. Results: Among 2,024,822 people tested in Mexico between February 27 and October 31 with an available result, we estimated 1,248,583 (95% confidence interval 1,094,850-1,572,818) cases, compared to 902,343 cases reported with positive tests. ICU admissions and deaths were 15% and 8% higher than reported, respectively. Conclusion: Accounting for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-based diagnostic tests' precision is a simple way to improve estimations for the true number of COVID-19 cases among tested persons.","Núñez, Isaac; Belaunzarán-Zamudio, Pablo F.; Caro-Vega, Yanink",Rev Invest Clin,,476

The purpose of this study has been to investigate the presence of detectable SARS-CoV-2 infection in ocular swabs in patients affected by COVID-19. A consecutive series of 74 COVID-19-positive patients (age 21-89) were enrolled at two Polish COVID-19 hospitals for 4 months and were characterized by PCR for the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 genetic material in nasopharyngeal (NP) and ocular swabs, while their respiratory and ocular symptoms were noted. Almost 50% of them presented with severe/critical respiratory involvement, and some degree of eye disease. No tight correlation was observed between the presence of ocular and respiratory symptoms. Three male patients presenting with severe/critical lung disease tested positive in ocular swab, however with mild/moderate ocular symptoms. In conclusion, our study lends further support to the view that overt ocular infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is not such a frequent occurrence.","Dolar-Szczasny, Joanna; Toro, Mario D; Dworzanska, Anna; Wójtowicz, Tomasz; Korona-Glowniak, Izabela; Sawicki, Rafal; Boguszewska, Anastazja; Polz-Dacewicz, Malgorzata; Tomasiewicz, Krzysztof; Zaluska, Wojciech; Rejdak, Robert; Bagnoli, Paola; Rusciano, Dario",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,476

It is divided into seven compartmental classes, namely, susceptible (S), exposed (E), symptomatically infected (I s ), asymptomatically infected (I a ), quarantined (Q), recovered (R), and death (D), respectively. The next-generation matrix approach was used to compute the basic reproduction number denoted as R cvd19 of the proposed model. The results show that the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable if R cvd19 < 1. On the other hand, the global asymptotic stability of the endemic equilibrium occurs if R cvd19 > 1. The mathematical analysis of the model is supported using numerical simulations. Moreover, the model's analysis and numerical results prove that the consistent use of face masks would go on a long way in reducing the COVID-19 pandemic.","Riyapan, Pakwan; Shuaib, Sherif Eneye; Intarasit, Arthit",Comput Math Methods Med,,476
287665,Innovation will help us leave a positive health legacy from COVID-19,2021,"The outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in a major epidemic threat worldwide. However, the effects of neoviruses on infected pregnant women and especially on their fetuses and newborns are not well understood. Most up-to-date evidences about how SARS-CoV-2 affected patients especially in pregnancy were collected by conducting a comprehensive search of medical literature electronic databases. Immune-related data of pregnant women, fetuses and newborns were further analysis. According to the limited literature, SARS-CoV-2 utilizes angiotensin converting enzyme 2 as its receptor and causes severe hypoxemia. Insufficiency of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 in pregnant women and the effects of hypoxia on the placental oxygen supply will cause severe perinatal complications. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 infection may disrupt maternal-fetal immune tolerance and cause immunological damage to embryos. Because of these reasons, pregnancy complications such as fetal demise or premature birth, preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, respiratory dyspnea, nervous system dysplasia and immune system defects are likely to occur in pregnant women with COVID-19 or their newborns. Pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 should be treated as a special group and given special attention. Fetuses and newborns of SARS-CoV-2-infected pregnant women should be given more protection to reduce the occurrence of adverse events. In this review, we intend to provide an overview of the physiological and immunological changes that induce the pregnancy complications. This article will benefit the treatment and prognosis of fetuses and newborns of SARS-CoV-2-infected pregnant women.","Dang, Dan; Wang, Liying; Zhang, Chuan; Li, Zhenyu; Wu, Hui",J Obstet Gynaecol Res,,476

In Europe, Italy was one of the frontrunner countries dealing with an emergency that significantly affected people's lives. Previous research on the psychological impact of the pandemic revealed an increase in anxiety, depression, and feelings of distress; however, these studies were conducted on non-representative samples of the population reached through social media channels, a method that is likely to lead to many forms of statistical and methodological bias. For the first time to our knowledge, we assessed the psychological impact of COVID-19 on 6700 Italian individuals, representative of the Italian population in terms of age, gender, and geographical areas revealing higher scores of depressive symptoms in females, younger adults, people reporting professional uncertainty and lower socio-economic status. A positive correlation was also found for individuals living alone, those who could not leave home for going to work, and people with a case of COVID-19 in the family, whereas the region of residence was not a significant predictor of depressive symptoms. These findings underline the importance of considering the psychological effects of COVID-19 and providing support to individuals seeking mental health care.","Delmastro, Marco; Zamariola, Giorgia",Sci Rep,,476

Elective surgeries, visits with general practitioners, and diagnoses of medical emergencies were consequently delayed. OBJECTIVE: To compare the characteristics of patients admitted to a northern Israeli hospital with common surgical complaints during three periods: the lockdown due to the COVID-19 outbreak, the Second Lebanon War in 2006, and a regular period. METHODS: Demographic, medical, laboratory, imaging, intraoperative, and pathological data were collected from electronic medical files of patients who received emergency treatment at the surgery department of a single hospital in northern Israel. We retrospectively compared the characteristics of patients who were admitted with various conditions during three periods. RESULTS: Patients' mean age and most of the clinical parameters assessed were similar between the periods. However, pain was reportedly higher during the COVID-19 than the control period (8.7 vs. 6.4 on a 10-point visual analog scale, P < 0.0001). During the COVID-19 outbreak, the Second Lebanon War, and the regular period, the mean numbers of patients admitted daily were 1.4, 4.4, and 3.0, respectively. The respective mean times from the onset of symptoms until admission were 3, 1, and 1.5 days, P < 0.001. The respective proportions of surgical interventions for appendiceal disease were 95%, 96%, and 69%; P = 0.03. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to a routine period, patients during the COVID-19 outbreak waited longer before turning to hospitalization, and reported more pain at arrival. Patients during both emergency periods were more often treated surgically than non-operatively.","Abu Shakra, Ibrahim; Bez, Maxim; Ganam, Samer; Francis, Rola; Muati, Amir; Bickel, Amitai; Merei, Fahed; Talmi, Ziv; Kamal, Khatib; Kakiashvili, Eli",BMC Surg,,476

However, it is not known if such practices can change the clinical course in infected individuals. METHODS: We prospectively studied an outbreak of COVID-19 in Switzerland among a population of 508 predominantly male soldiers with a median age of 21 years. We followed the number of infections in two spatially separated cohorts with almost identical baseline characteristics with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) before and after implementation of stringent social distancing. RESULTS: Of the 354 soldiers infected prior to the implementation of social distancing, 30% fell ill from COVID-19. While no soldier in a group of 154, in which infections appeared after implementation of social distancing, developed COVID-19 despite the detection of viral RNA in the nose and virus-specific antibodies within this group. CONCLUSIONS: Social distancing not only can slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of young, healthy adults but can also prevent the outbreak of COVID-19 while still inducing an immune response and colonizing nasal passages. Viral inoculum during infection or mode of transmission may be key factors determining the clinical course of COVID-19.","Bielecki, Michel; Züst, Roland; Siegrist, Denise; Meyerhofer, Daniele; Crameri, Giovanni Andrea Gerardo; Stanga, Zeno Giovanni; Stettbacher, Andreas; Buehrer, Thomas Werner; Deuel, Jeremy Werner",Clin. infect. dis,,476

This race aims to find, by various means, weapons to counter the Covid-19 pandemic now widespread on all continents. The aquatic world and in particular that of photosynthetic organisms is regularly highlighted but paradoxically little exploited in view of the tremendous possibilities it offers. Computational tools allow not only to clear the existence and activity of many molecules but also to model their relationships with receptors identified in potential hosts. On a routine basis, our laboratory carries out a research activity on functionalities of molecules derived from algae using in silico tools. We have implemented our skills in algae biology and in modeling, as tests in order to identify molecules expressed by the genus Arthrospira showing an antiviral potential and more particularly anti-SARS-CoV-2. Using consensus docking and redocking with Autodock Vina and SwissDock, we were able to identify several promising molecules from Arthrospira: phycocyanobilin, phycoerythrobilin, phycourobilin, and folic acid. These four compounds showed reliable binding energies comprised between - 6.95 and - 7.45 kcal.mol-1 in Autodock Vina and between - 9.285 and - 10.35 kcal.mol-1 with SwissDock. Toxicity prediction as well as current regulations provided promising arguments for the inclusion of these compounds in further studies to assess their ability to compete with the SARS-CoV-2/ACE2 complex both in vitro and in vivo.

This study examines these effects with common face masks, namely a neck gaiter, disposable surgical mask, and N95 mask, as well as a novel material that could be used as a mask (acoustic foam). A recorded excerpt from the ""Star-Spangled Banner"" was played through a miniature speaker placed inside the mouth of a masked manikin. Experienced listeners were asked to rate perceptual qualities of these singing stimuli by blindly comparing them with the same recording captured without a mask. Acoustic analysis showed that face masks affected the sound by enhancing or suppressing different frequency bands compared to no mask. Acoustic energy around the singer's formant was reduced when using surgical and N95 masks, which matches observations that these masks are more detrimental to the perceptions of singing voice compared with neck gaiter or acoustic foam. It suggests that singers can benefit from masks designed for minimal impact on auditory perception of the singing voice while maintaining reasonable efficacy of filtering efficiency.","Oren, Liran; Rollins, Michael; Gutmark, Ephraim; Howell, Rebecca",J. voice,,476

The paper engages with debates about the nature of co-productive relations, advocating for a more affective approach which attends to multiple, temporary moments within the research, rather than seeking a grand or unified process of collaboration. Design/methodology/approach: This methodological paper draws on the records and reflections the author generated in the process of undertaking collaborative ethnographic research, considered with a specific theoretical resource (Lauren Berlant's Cruel Optimism (2011)) to construct a reflexive narrative from her doctoral research experiences. Findings: The paper discusses the multiple, shifting ways in which research relationships unfolded in my doctoral research and the impasse this generated in the author’s understanding of desirable co-productive relations. Reflecting with Berlant's Cruel Optimism (2011) allowed the author to understand the Covid-19 crisis as the rupture of the author’s attachment to this relational fantasy. Beyond this rupture, the author was able to more fully attend to fleeting, affective moments as a form of co-production within the research.

Many biomarkers have been suggested using large observational datasets but sample timing is crucial to ensure prognostic relevance. The DISCOVER study prospectively recruited patients with COVID-19 admitted to a UK hospital and analysed a panel of putative prognostic biomarkers on the admission blood sample to identify markers of poor outcome. METHODS: Consecutive patients admitted to hospital with proven or clinicoradiological suspected COVID-19 were consented. Admission bloods were extracted from the clinical laboratory. A panel of biomarkers (interleukin-6 (IL-6), soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR), Krebs von den Lungen 6, troponin, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, B-type natriuretic peptide, procalcitonin) were performed in addition to routinely performed markers (C reactive protein (CRP), neutrophils, lymphocytes, neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio). Age, National Early Warning Score (NEWS2), CURB-65 and radiographic severity score on initial chest radiograph were included as comparators. All biomarkers were tested in logistic regression against a composite outcome of non-invasive ventilation, intensive care admission or death, with area under the curve (AUC) (figures calculated). RESULTS: 187 patients had 28-day outcomes at the time of analysis. CRP (AUC: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.59 to 0.78), lymphocyte count (AUC: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.53 to 0.72) and other routine markers did not predict the primary outcome. IL-6 (AUC: 0.77, 0.65 to 0.88) and suPAR (AUC: 0.81, 0.72 to 0.88) showed some promise, but simple clinical features alone such as NEWS2 score (AUC: 0.70, 0.60 to 0.79) or age (AUC: 0.70, 0.62 to 0.77) performed nearly as well. DISCUSSION: Admission blood biomarkers have only moderate predictive value for predicting COVID-19 outcomes, while simple clinical features such as age and NEWS2 score outperform many biomarkers. IL-6 and suPAR had the best performance, and further studies should focus on the additive value of these biomarkers to routine care.","Arnold, David T; Attwood, Marie; Barratt, Shaney; Morley, Anna; Elvers, Karen T; McKernon, Jorgen; Donald, Charmaine; Oates, Adrian; Noel, Alan; MacGowan, Alasdair; Maskell, Nick A; Hamilton, Fergus W",Emerg. med. j,,476

Numbers of infected people and deaths by COVID-19 are increasing every day worldwide, therefore self-isolation and protection are highly recommended to prevent the spread of the virus and especially to protect major risk groups such as the elderly population and people with comorbidities including diabetes, hypertension, cancer, cardiovascular diseases and metabolic syndrome. On the other hand, young people without any secondary disease have died by COVID-19 as well. In this study we compared two male patients infected by COVID-19 at the same age and one of them was diagnosed with G6PD deficiency. Both COVID-19 and G6PD deficiency enhance the risk of hemolysis and thrombosis. Serum biochemistry, hemogram and immunological parameters showed that risk of hemolysis and thrombosis may increase in the G6PD deficient patient infected by COVID-19.","Aydemir, Duygu; Daglioglu, Gulcin; Candevir, Aslihan; Kurtaran, Behice; Bozdogan, Sevcan Tan; Inal, Tamer Cevat; Ulusu, Nuriye Nuray",Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids,,476

Glycemic control is important factor in preventing the complications associated with diabetes. Pillars for good glycemic control are good life style modification with proper medication under medical guidance. The aim of this study was to study the effect of lock down on glycemic control in diabetic patients and possible factor responsible for this. MATERIAL AND METHODS: - Out of 407 only 143 diabetic patients who attended the our endocrine OPD in last 3 months who had good glycemic control in past without any chronic complication and willing to participate were included in study. They were advised for the self-monitoring of blood glucose for identifying the glycemic control and with questionnaire designed possible factor was identified during the lockdown period. RESULTS: - The patients were aged between 18 and 65 years with mean age of 54.68 years and male to female ratio was 91:52.56 (39.16%) patients reported worsening of hyperglycemia and requiring addition of medications for control of blood glucose and 3 (2.09%) patients reported hypoglycemic events and medications were stepped down.

294717,COVID-19 Healthcare Inequity: Lessons Learned from Annual Influenza Vaccination Rates to Mitigate COVID-19 Vaccine Disparities,2021,"Seasonal workers are increasingly important in some Member States as a means to fill the labour market needs. Preferred due to their lower salaries, greater docility and the evasion of administrative and social security obligations, migrant workers are often treated less favourably than domestic workers in terms of employment rights, benefits and access to adequate housing. The agricultural sector of employment is particularly at risk of labour exploitation during harvest seasons and thus associated with atypical or informal forms of employment and precarious working conditions. The COVID-19 pandemic gave visibility to the new risks the seasonal workers are exposed to. In addition, it showed that in some cases such problems can lead to the further spreading of infectious diseases and increase the risk of COVID-19 clusters. The consequences of of the pandemic can be observed in Croatia too. This paper primarily covers the position of third-country nationals who enter and reside in Croatia for the purpose of agricultural seasonal work within the framework of the Seasonal Workers Directive (Directive 2014/36/EU). Significant challenges facing the Croatian labour market have been addressed by means of a comparative approach in order to present the current situation on the EU labour market and suggest potential legal solutions applicable in regard to the national circumstances.","Kotulovski, Karla PhD Candidate Teaching Research Assistant Laleta Sandra PhD Associate Professor",EU and Comparative Law Issues and Challenges Series,,476

HSCT provides a potential cure for some hematologic malignancies. However, it entails a protracted hospitalization, substantial physical side effects, and a decline in psychological well-being and quality of life. The COVID-19 pandemic has tightened many of the already strict procedures put in place for HSCT patients in order to protect their vulnerable immune systems, which could lead to more distress. Alternatively, exposure to this public health crisis may unlock the lives of HSCT survivors for their communities and healthcare providers to further inspire HSCT care built on a stronger foundation of empathy.","Amonoo, Hermioni L; Longley, Regina M; El-Jawahri, Areej",J Psychosoc Oncol,,476
294893,BCG versus COVID-19: impact on urology,2020,"PLX7904 and PLX8394 are novel BRAFV600E inhibitors-BRAFi that are designed to evade the paradoxical MAPK activation, a trait for the name ""paradox breakers""-PB. Current FDA approved inhibitors (Vemurafenib, Dabrafenib, Encorafenib) although improved progression-free survival of mtBRAF melanoma patients suffer from this treatment related side effect. mtBRAF Colorectal Cancer (CRC) is resistant to the approved BRAF inhibitors, although combinatorial treatment co-targeting BRAF and EGFR/MEK is offering a promising prospect. In an effort to explore the potential of the novel BRAF inhibitors-PB to impede CRC cell proliferation, they were tested on RKO, HT29 and Colo-205 cells, bearing the BRAFV600E mutation. This study shows that the BRAF paradox breakers PLX7904 and PLX8394 cause a more prolonged MAPK pathway inhibition and achieve a stronger blockage of proliferation and reduced viability than PLX4720, the sister compound of Vemurafenib. In some treatment conditions, cells can undergo apoptosis. Genomic analysis on the more resistant RKO cells treated with PLX7904, PLX8394 and PLX4720 showed similar gene expression pattern, but the alterations imposed by the PB were more intense. Bioinformatic analysis resulted in a short list of genes representing potential master regulators of the cellular response to BRAF inhibitors' treatments. From our results, it is clear that the BRAF paradox breakers present a notable differential regulation of major pathways, like MAPK signalling, apoptosis, cell cycle, or developmental signalling pathways. Combinatorial treatments of BRAFi with Mcl-1 and Notch modulators show a better effect than mono-treatments. Additional pathways could be further exploited in novel efficient combinatorial treatment protocols with BRAFi.","Koumaki, Kassandra; Kontogianni, Georgia; Kosmidou, Vivian; Pahitsa, Fani; Kritsi, Eftychia; Zervou, Maria; Chatziioannou, Aristotelis; Souliotis, Vassilis L; Papadodima, Olga; Pintzas, Alexander",Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Basis Dis,,476
295411,Gazi Medical Journal – Eczacılık Fakültesi COVID-19 Özel Sayısı Önsözü,2020,"The present study discusses the genomic analysis of Bacillus sp. ISTL8 along with the production of EPS (Extracellular polymeric substances) using carbofuran, a toxic carbamate pesticide. Bacillus strain was isolated from landfill soil and evaluated for high growth rates and EPS production. One strain, renamed ISTL8 grew on a broad range of carbon sources, including toxic carbofuran, while producing copious EPS. Growth assays verified the strain to be thermophilic, low salt tolerant, and with a preference for neutral pH. SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) was used for morphological characterization of the EPS while the monomeric composition, bonding patterns and functional groups were deduced by GC-MS (Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry), 1H and 13C NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) and FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy). The production of EPS using carbofuran (carbamate pesticide) as a carbon source was found to be 6.20 ± 0.29 g L-1 containing 61.17% w/w carbohydrates, 29.72% w/w proteins and 6.11% w/w lipids (of dry EPS). The potential cytotoxicity of EPS was evaluated with 3- (4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-Yl) -2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and found non-toxic (2.25%). WGS (Whole genome sequencing) was performed for the strain Bacillus sp. ISTL8 producing EPS; an array of genes putatively involved in the EPS production were identified in several different genomic locations, guiding potential genetic manipulation studies in the future. The results highlight the potency of a bacterial isolate Bacillus sp. ISTL8 to produce non-cytotoxic EPS using carbofuran that can be further harnessed for environmental and commercial applications. Additionally, WGS revealed an array of EPS specific genes which can be effectively engineered for much enhanced production.","Gupta, Juhi; Rathour, Rashmi; Dupont, Christopher L; Kaul, Drishti; Thakur, Indu Shekhar",Environ Res,,476

295883,COVID-19 predictability in the United States using Google Trends time series,2020,"In the throes of the current coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, interest has burgeoned in the cardiovascular complications of this virulent viral infection. As troponin, a biomarker of cardiac injury, often rises in hospitalized patients, its interpretation and actionability require careful consideration. Fulminant myocarditis due to direct viral infection can certainly occur, but in patients with increased oxygen demands due to tachycardia and fever and reduced oxygen delivery due to hypotension and hypoxemia, COVID-19 disease can cause myocardial injury indirectly. Cytokines released during the acute infection can elicit activation of cells within pre-existing atherosclerotic lesions, augmenting thrombotic risk and risk of ischemic syndromes. Moreover, microvascular activation by cytokines can cause not only myocardial injury but can also harm other organ systems commonly involved in COVID-19 infections including the kidneys. Dealing with the immense challenge of COVID-19, confronted with severely ill patients in dire straits with virtually no rigorous evidence base to guide our therapy, we must call on our clinical skills and judgment. These touchstones can help guide us in selecting patients who might benefit from the advanced imaging and invasive procedures that present enormous logistical challenges in the current context. Lacking a robust evidence base, pathophysiologic reasoning can help guide our choices of therapy for individual clinical scenarios. We must exercise caution and extreme humility, as often plausible interventions fail when tested rigorously. But act today we must, and understanding the multiplicity of mechanisms of myocardial injury in COVID-19 infection will help us meet our mission unsupported by the comfort of strong data.","Libby, Peter",JACC Basic Transl Sci,,476

PATIENTS: We retrospectively reviewed the data of 26 children who underwent mini-URS-LL for obstructive stones in proximal ureter between January 2016 and August 2018. The effectiveness of the mini-URS-LL was assessed based on the feasibility, reliability, and success of the technique. RESULTS: Mean age was 3 ± 1.3 years, and 11 (42.3%) patients were &#8804;2 years old, remaining 15 (57.7%) were aged 3-5 years. Mean stone size was 9.11 ± 3.02 mm. A stone-free status was obtained at the end of 31 ureteroscopic procedure in 24 (92.3%) patients. The mean age was found significantly higher in patients who had the procedure without pre-stenting than the others who did (P = .027). No perioperative complication was experienced. CONCLUSION: In preschool-age children, laser lithotripsy with mini-URS may be a safe technique in the hands with advanced endo-urological skills but it has low efficacy with higher rates of prestenting causing additional anesthesia sessions.","Dogan, Ahmet Burak; Özkan, Keramettin Ugur; Güler, Ahmet Gökhan",,,476
296644,Low Frequency of Acute Pancreatitis in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Pregnant women with moderate symptoms of COVID-19 are at risk for progressing to severe or critical illness. While there are limited data on the management of severe COVID-19 during pregnancy, information on pharmacological treatments of moderate COVID-19 is lacking. We report clinical outcomes of pregnant women hospitalized due to moderate COVID-19 illness treated with a 5-day course of remdesivir, antibiotics, and/or glucocorticoids. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Case series of pregnant women hospitalized with moderate symptoms of COVID -19 pneumonia at two INOVA Health System hospitals from April 1 to December 31, 2020. Primary outcome was clinical recovery (breathing on ambient air and/or hospital discharge) on hospital day 7 (HD7). Cox regression analysis was performed to evaluate which variables were associated with the primary outcome. RESULTS: Out of 748 pregnant women with confirmed infection by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, 35 were hospitalized due to moderate symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia (median gestational age 29 weeks). There was no maternal death. Seventeen patients received remdesivir within 48 hours of hospitalization: 15 remained with moderate symptoms and 2 (who also received glucocorticoids) had progressed to critical COVID-19 at remdesivir initiation; all 17 women in this group achieved clinical recovery on HD7. Seven women received remdesivir >48 hours following admission after they began treatment with glucocorticoids ± antibiotics and worsened to severe or critical disease; they all required supplemental oxygen on HD7. Eleven women were treated with antibiotics ± glucocorticoids but no remdesivir; on HD7, 3/11 achieved clinical recovery. Clinical recovery was significantly different among treatment groups; p < 0.001. When analyzing only women who remained with moderate symptoms at pharmacological treatments initiation, all 15 on remdesivir and only 3 of 11 on antibiotics achieved clinical recovery on HD7; p < 0.001. Delaying remdesivir for >48 hours after admission (HR 2.32, 95% CI 1.45-4.16) and >4-day duration of symptoms prior to hospitalization (HR 1.65, 95% CI 1.27-3.50) had an inverse association with clinical recovery. Incidental oligohydramnios was seen in 3/24 (12.5%) of women within 5 days of completing remdesivir treatment. Elevated transaminases was prevalent in women treated with remdesivir (8/24, 33.3%). CONCLUSION: In our cohort, prompt initiation of remdesivir in pregnant women hospitalized with moderate symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia within 48 hours of admission prevented worsening and allowed a fast clinical recovery by HD7. Deferring remdesivir for >48 hours after hospitalization and duration of symptoms >4 days before admission were independently associated with delayed clinical recovery and longer hospital admission.

This study describes gut microbiota dysbiosis in COVID-19 patients and its implications relating to the disease. Design: A cross sectional prospective study was performed on thirty RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Bhopal, India, between September 10 and 20, 2020. Ten healthy volunteers were recruited as the control group. IFN, TNF, and IL-21 profiling was conducted using plasma samples, and gut bacterial analysis was performed after obtaining the metagenomics data of stool samples. Results: Patients with a variable COVID-19 severity showed distinct gut microflora and peripheral interleukin-21 levels. A low Firmicute/Bacteroidetes ratio, caused by the depletion of the fibre-utilizing bacteria, F. prausnitzii, B. Plebius, and Prevotella, and an increase in Bacteroidetes has associated gut microbiota dysbiosis with COVID-19 disease severity. Conclusions: The loss of the functional attributes of signature commensals in the gut, due to dysbiosis, is a predisposing factor of COVID-19 pathophysiology.","Khan, Mahejibin Mathew Bijina J.; Gupta, Priyal Garg Garima Khadanga Sagar Vyas Ashish Kumar Singh Anirudh K.",Microorganisms,,476

The trajectory of the global spread is worrisome, particularly in heavily populated countries such as Nigeria. The study objective was to assess and compare the pattern of COVID-19 spread in Nigeria and seven other countries during the first 120 days of the outbreak. METHODS: Data was extracted from the World Bank's website. A descriptive analysis was conducted as well as modelling of COVID-19 spread from day one through day 120 in Nigeria and seven other countries. Model fitting was conducted using linear, quadratic, cubic and exponential regression methods (&#945;=0.05). RESULTS: The COVID-19 spread pattern in Nigeria was similar to the patterns in Egypt, Ghana and Cameroun. The daily death distribution in Nigeria was similar to those of six out of the seven countries considered. There was an increasing trend in the daily COVID-19 confirmed cases in Nigeria. During the lockdown, the growth rate in Nigeria was 5.85 (R2=0.728, p< 0.001); however, it was 8.42 (R2=0.625, p< 0.001) after the lockdown was relaxed. The cubic polynomial model (CPM) provided the best fit for predicting COVID-19 cumulative cases across all the countries investigated and there was a clear deviation from the exponential growth model. Using the CPM, the predicted number of cases in Nigeria at 3-month (30 September 2020) was 155,467 (95% CI:151,111-159,824, p< 0.001), all things being equal.

298894,Mapping the Global Spatio-Temporal Dynamics of Covid-19 Outbreak Using Cartograms During the First 150 Days of the Pandemic,2020,"Importance: Cancer treatment delay has been reported to variably impact cancer-specific survival and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-specific mortality during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic. During the pandemic, treatment delay is being recommended in a nonquantitative, nonobjective, and nonpersonalized manner, and this approach may be associated with suboptimal outcomes. Quantitative integration of cancer mortality estimates and data on the consequences of treatment delay is needed to aid treatment decisions and improve patient outcomes. Objective: To obtain quantitative integration of cancer-specific and COVID-19-specific mortality estimates that can be used to make optimal decisions for individual patients and optimize resource allocation. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this decision analytical model, age-specific and stage-specific estimates of overall survival pre-COVID-19 were adjusted by the probability of COVID-19 (individualized by county, treatment-specific variables, hospital exposure frequency, and COVID-19 infectivity estimates), COVID-19 mortality (individualized by age-specific, comorbidity-specific, and treatment-specific variables), and delay of cancer treatment (impact and duration). These model estimates were integrated into a web application (OncCOVID) to calculate estimates of the cumulative overall survival and restricted mean survival time of patients who received immediate vs delayed cancer treatment. Using currently available information about COVID-19, a susceptible-infected-recovered model that accounted for the increased risk among patients at health care treatment centers was developed. This model integrated the data on cancer mortality and the consequences of treatment delay to aid treatment decisions. Age-specific and cancer stage-specific estimates of overall survival pre-COVID-19 were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database for 691 854 individuals with 25 cancer types who received cancer diagnoses in 2005 to 2006. Data from 5â¯436â¯896 individuals in the National Cancer Database were used to estimate the independent impact of treatment delay by cancer type and stage. In addition, data from 275 patients in a nested case-control study were used to estimate the COVID-19 mortality rate by age group and number of comorbidities. Data were analyzed from March 17 to May 21, 2020. Exposures: COVID-19 and cancer. Main Outcomes and Measures: Estimates of restricted mean survival time after the receipt of immediate vs delayed cancer treatment. Results: At the time of the study, the OncCOVID web application allowed for the selection of up to 47 individualized variables to assess net survival for an individual patient with cancer. Substantial heterogeneity was found regarding the association between delayed cancer treatment and net survival among patients with a given cancer type and stage, and these 2 variables were insufficient to discriminate the net impact of immediate vs delayed treatment. Individualized overall survival estimates were associated with patient age, number of comorbidities, treatment received, and specific local community estimates of COVID-19 risk. Conclusions and Relevance: This decision analytical modeling study found that the OncCOVID web-based application can quantitatively aid in the resource allocation of individualized treatment for patients with cancer during the COVID-19 global pandemic.","Hartman, Holly E; Sun, Yilun; Devasia, Theresa P; Chase, Elizabeth C; Jairath, Neil K; Dess, Robert T; Jackson, William C; Morris, Emily; Li, Pin; Hochstedler, Kimberly A; Abbott, Madeline R; Kidwell, Kelley M; Walter, Vonn; Wang, Ming; Wang, Xi; Zaorsky, Nicholas G; Schipper, Matthew J; Spratt, Daniel E",JAMA Oncol,,476

In some cases, vaccine-related lymphadenopathy and FDG uptake on PET/CT can mimic cancer and lead to confounding imaging results. These cases where findings overlap with cancer pose a significant dilemma for diagnostic purposes, follow-up, and management leading to possible treatment delays, unnecessary repeat imaging and sampling, and patient anxiety. These cases can largely be avoided by optimal coordination between vaccination and planned imaging as well as preemptive selection of vaccine administration site. This coordination hinges on patient, oncologist, and radiologists' awareness of this issue and collaboration. Through close communication and patient education, we believe this will eliminate significant challenges for our oncology patients as we strive to end this pandemic.","McIntosh, Lacey J; Rosen, Max P; Mittal, Kriti; Whalen, Giles F; Bathini, Venu G; Ali, Tasneem; Edmiston, Kathryn L; Walsh, William V; Gerber, Jonathan M",Cancer Treat Rev,,476

(preprint),2020,"OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to describe the incidence and severity of ocular exposure to alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR) in children presenting to a tertiary medical center during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic. METHODS: A retrospective single-center observational study conducted from February 21, 2020, to October 11, 2020. Subjects 10 years or younger who presented with ABHR-induced ocular injury were included. The same period from 2019 was studied and a comparison was performed between the 2 years. Outcome measures included the number of subjects with ocular injury due to ABHR, extent of ocular epithelial defects, length of hospitalization and time to resolution. RESULTS: A total of 9 patients presented to the Pediatric Emergency Department after sustaining ocular chemical injuries from ABHR during this period. Treatment included immediate irrigation followed by topical antibiotics, steroids, and lubrication. Six children were discharged and followed as outpatients with no reported adverse ocular sequelae. Three patients exhibited epithelial defects involving 85% to 100% of the cornea, 30% to 75% of the conjunctiva and required inpatient treatment ranging from 4 to 11 days. All patients experienced a complete resolution of the ocular epithelial defects after 12 to 19 days. No long-term irreversible damage was observed and visual acuity returned to normal in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: The utilization of ABHR during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic resulted in childhood ocular injury. Prompt treatment led to good visual outcomes. These products should be regarded as potentially toxic and stored out of the reach of young children.","Wasser, Lauren M; Koppel, Jordanna H; Zadok, David; Berkowitz, Liron; Abulafia, Adi; Heiman, Eyal; Aryan, Ahmad; Roditi, Eduardo; Weill, Yishay",Pediatr. emerg. care,,476

The data of 12 adult COVID-19 pneumonia patients who were followed in the inpatient clinics of Biruni University Medical Faculty Hospital (Istanbul, Turkey) were retrospectively analyzed. Diagnostic tests, laboratory examinations, clinical findings, and computed tomography of the thorax imaging results were evaluated. A dramatic laboratory and clinical improvement was observed in 83% (10 out of 12) of patients after tocilizumab. In 17% (2 out of 12) of our patients, short-term ventilator support was required in the intensive care unit. The longest hospital stay was 18 days. However, in the end, all of our patients were discharged home with good health. Although arterial oxygen saturations (87.58 ± 3.12%) dropped in room air in the pre-tocilizumab period, post-tocilizumab they normalized in all patients (94.42 ± 1%). None of them had fever after tocilizumab treatment and the levels of C-reactive protein (13.08 ± 12.89) were almost within normal limits. Eosinophil values were quite low at the time of diagnosis (10 ± 17.06), but increased significantly post-tocilizumab (155.33 ± 192.69). There is currently no proven treatment for COVID-19 induced by novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Based on our experience with twelve adult COVID-19 pneumonia patients,we can say that tocilizumab, an IL-6 inhibitor, is more beneficial in preventing the damage caused by excessive cytokine response in the body if administered at the right time and provides clinical and radiological recovery.","Borku Uysal, Betul; Ikitimur, Hande; Yavuzer, Serap; Ikitimur, Baris; Uysal, Harun; Islamoglu, Mehmet Sami; Ozcan, Erkan; Aktepe, Emre; Yavuzer, Hakan; Cengiz, Mahir",J. med. virol,,476

The present study evaluated the clinical and nutritional characteristics of COVID-19 patients and explored the relationship between risk for malnutrition at admission and in-hospital mortality. METHODS: A retrospective, observational study was conducted in two hospitals in Hubei, China. Confirmed cases of COVID-19 were typed as mild/moderate, severe, or critically ill. Clinical data and in-hospital death were collected. The risk for malnutrition was assessed using the geriatric nutritional risk index (GNRI), the prognostic nutritional index (PNI), and the Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT) via objective parameters at admission. RESULTS: Two hundred ninety-five patients were enrolled, including 66 severe patients and 41 critically ill patients. Twenty-five deaths were observed, making 8.47% in the whole population and 37.88% in the critically ill subgroup. Patients had significant differences in nutrition-related parameters and inflammatory biomarkers among three types of disease severity. Patients with lower GNRI and PNI, as well as higher CONUT scores, had a higher risk of in-hospital mortality. The receiver operating characteristic curves demonstrated the good prognostic implication of GNRI and CONUT score. The multivariate logistic regression showed that baseline nutritional status, assessed by GNRI, PNI, or CONUT score, was a prognostic indicator for in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Despite variant screening tools, poor nutritional status was associated with in-hospital death in patients infected with COVID-19. This study highlighted the importance of nutritional screening at admission and the new insight of nutritional monitoring or therapy.","Song, Feier; Ma, Huan; Wang, Shouhong; Qin, Tiehe; Xu, Qing; Yuan, Huiqing; Li, Fei; Wang, Zhonghua; Liao, Youwan; Tan, Xiaoping; Song, Xiuchan; Zhang, Qing; Huang, Daozheng",Nutr J,,476

In particular, the asymptomatic patients have been found to induce weak and transient SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown; meanwhile, the protective immunity that guide the recovery of these asymptomatic patients is elusive. Here, we characterized SARS-CoV-2-specific B-cell and T-cell responses in 10 asymptomatic patients and 64 patients with other disease severity (mild, n = 10, moderate, n = 32, severe, n = 12) and found that asymptomatic or mild symptomatic patients failed to mount virus-specific germinal center (GC) B cell responses that result in robust and prolonged humoral immunity, assessed by GC response indicators including follicular helper T (TFH) cell and memory B cell responses as well as serum CXCL13 levels. Alternatively, these patients mounted potent virus-specific TH1 and CD8+ T cell responses. In sharp contrast, patients of moderate or severe disease induced vigorous virus-specific GC B cell responses and associated TFH responses; however, the virus-specific TH1 and CD8+ T cells were minimally induced in these patients. These results, therefore, uncovered the protective immunity in asymptomatic patients and also revealed the strikingly dichotomous and incomplete humoral and cellular immune responses in COVID-19 patients with different disease severity, providing important insights into rational design of effective COVID-19 vaccines.","Gao, Leiqiong; Zhou, Jing; Yang, Sen; Wang, Lisha; Chen, Xiangyu; Yang, Yang; Li, Ren; Pan, Zhiwei; Zhao, Jing; Li, Zhirong; Huang, Qizhao; Tang, Jianfang; Hu, Li; Liu, Pinghuang; Zhang, Guozhong; Chen, Yaokai; Ye, Lilin",Signal Transduct Target Ther,,476
302662,"Impacts of COVID-19 on U.S. aquaculture, aquaponics, and allied businesses",2020,"BACKGROUND: Many research has indicated that, during the COVID-19 pandemic, health care workers are under greatly increased pressure and at increased risk for the development of mental health problems. Furthermore, previous research has indicated that psychiatrists are exposed to a number of unique stressors that may increase their risk for poor mental health. The aims of the present study were to assess the level of COVID-19 related concerns, psychological distress and life satisfaction among psychiatrists and other physicians during the first period of the pandemic and to examine whether individual differences in COVID-19 concerns, psychological flexibility, psychological resilience and coping behaviors account for differences in mental health indicators. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The sample consisted of N=725 physicians, among whom 22.8% were psychiatrists. This study was conducted online during the first lockdown in Croatia and collected data regarding COVID-19 related concerns, coping behaviors and mental health indicators (Psychological Distress and Life Satisfaction). RESULTS: Physicians of other specialties had higher scores on a measure of COVID-19 anxiety than psychiatrists (p=0.012). In addition, a number of differences in coping behaviors are evident. Specifically, psychiatrists were less likely than physicians of other specializations to believe that being informed about COVID-19 is an effective coping strategy (p=0.013), but more prone to using sedatives and drugs as a coping strategy (p=0.002; p=0.037). CONCLUSIONS: Psychiatrists are at special risk for substance abuse. Younger age, psychological inflexibility, low resilience and greater COVID-19 concerns might act as specific risk factors for distress. Our findings highlight the need for promoting a healthy lifestyle and psychological flexibility as universal protective factors.","Jokic-Begic, Natasa; Lauri Korajlija, Anita; Begic, Drazen",Psychiatr Danub,,476

However, the mechanisms by which intolerance of uncertainty (IU) affects negative emotions during the COVID-19 pandemic remain unclear. This study aimed to explore the mediating role of pandemic-focused time and the moderating role of perceived efficacy in the association between IU and negative emotions during the COVID-19 pandemic based on the uncertainty-time-efficacy-emotion model (UTEE). 1131 participants were recruited to complete measures of COVID-19 IU, pandemic-focused time, perceived efficacy, negative emotions and demographic variables during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results showed that COVID-19 IU was significantly and positively associated with negative emotions, and this link could be mediated by pandemic-focused time. Moreover, the direct effect of COVID-19 IU on negative emotions was moderated by perceived efficacy. Specifically, the direct effect of COVID-19 IU on negative emotions was much stronger for individuals with lower levels of perceived efficacy. The current study further extended the previous integrative uncertainty tolerance model. Furthermore, the study suggested that policy makers and mental health professionals should reduce the general public's negative emotions during the pandemic through effective interventions such as adjusting COVID-19 IU, shortening pandemic-focused time and enhancing perceived efficacy.","Dai, W.; Meng, G.; Zheng, Y.; Li, Q.; Dai, B.; Liu, X.",International Journal of Environmental Research &amp; Public Health [Electronic Resource],,476

We sought to compare physician visit rates for postpartum mental illness in Ontario, Canada, during the pandemic with rates expected based on prepandemic patterns. METHODS: In this population-based, repeated cross-sectional study using linked health administrative databases in Ontario, Canada, we used negative binomial regression to model expected visit rates per 1000 postpartum people for March-November 2020 based on prepandemic data (January 2016-February 2020). We compared observed visit rates to expected visit rates for each month of the pandemic period, generating absolute rate differences, incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The primary outcome was a visit to a primary care physician or a psychiatrist for any mental disorder. We stratified analyses by maternal sociodemographic characteristics. RESULTS: In March 2020, the visit rate was 43.5/1000, with a rate difference of 3.11/1000 (95% CI 1.25-4.89) and an IRR of 1.08 (95% CI 1.03-1.13) compared with the expected rate. In April, the rate difference (10.9/1000, 95% CI 9.14-12.6) and IRR (1.30, 95% CI 1.24-1.36) were higher; this level was generally sustained through November 2020. From April-November, we observed elevated visit rates across provider types and for diagnoses of anxiety, depressive and alcohol or substance use disorders. Observed increases from expected visit rates were greater for people 0-90 days postpartum compared with 91-365 days postpartum; increases were small among people living in low-income neighbourhoods. Public health units in the northern areas of the province did not see sustained elevations in visit rates after July; southern health units had elevated rates through to November. INTERPRETATION: Increased visits for mental health conditions among postpartum people during the first 9 months of the COVID-19 pandemic suggest an increased need for effective and accessible mental health care for this population as the pandemic progresses.","Vigod, Simone N; Brown, Hilary K; Huang, Anjie; Fung, Kinwah; Barker, Lucy C; Hussain-Shamsy, Neesha; Wright, Elisabeth; Dennis, Cindy-Lee; Grigoriadis, Sophie; Gozdyra, Peter; Corsi, Daniel; Walker, Mark; Moineddin, Rahim",CMAJ,,476

The findings provide evidence that language instructors and students benefit somewhat from general technological instruction but much more from instruction that is combined with language pedagogy. The main conclusions drawn from this study are that intra-linguistic and cross-linguistic pedagogical exchanges fostered the successful execution of fully online teaching, and that online learning is more than just a digital replicate of learning in person.

Ministers' work frequently puts them in close contact with diverse groups, and therefore at higher risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2, but this is not specific to Africa. This paper discusses five non-mutually exclusive hypotheses for the Africa-specific trend, involving comorbidity, poorly resourced healthcare and possible restrictions in accessing out-of-country health facilities, the underreporting of cases, and, later, the disproportionate impact of the so-called 'South African' variant (501Y.V2). The paper then turns its attention to the public health and political implications of the trend. While governments have measures in place to cope with the sudden loss of top officials, the COVID-19-related deaths have been associated with substantial changes in public health policy in cases where the response to the pandemic had initially been contested or minimal. Ministerial deaths may also result in a reconfiguration of political leadership, but we do not expect a wave of younger and more gender representative replacements. Rather, we speculate that a disconnect may emerge between the top leadership and the public, with junior ministers filling the void and in so doing putting themselves more at risk of infection. Opposition politicians may also be at significant risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2.","Falisse, Jean-Benoît; Macdonald, Robert; Molony, Thomas; Nugent, Paul",,,476

Various types of bacterial and fungal infections occur in patients with COVID-19 with some resistant to antimicrobials that are associated with significantly worse outcomes and deaths. Besides, antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) co-infections are responsible for clinically significant mortality in past pandemics. There is evidence to suggest that factors such as the proliferation of adulterated antimicrobials in some developing countries, international travels, issues with healthcare financing, use/misuse by humans, and in agricultural production and climate change are determinants of AMR at various levels of society. These complex interrelated determinants intersect with AMR in current and past pandemics and could amplify the potential of a future antimicrobial resistance pandemic. Therefore, global concerted interventions targeted at all levels of society to reduce the use/misuse of antimicrobials and disrupt these multifaceted, interrelated, and interdependent factors are urgently needed. This paper leverages prior research to describe complex major determinants of antimicrobial resistance and provides fresh insights into possible intervention strategies to tackle antimicrobial resistance including in the current and future pandemics.","Ukuhor, Hyacinth O",J Infect Public Health,,476

On October 30, the number of new cases reported in the United States in a single day exceeded 100,000 for the first time, and by December 2 had reached a daily high of 196,227.* With colder weather, more time spent indoors, the ongoing U.S. holiday season, and silent spread of disease, with approximately 50% of transmission from asymptomatic persons (2), the United States has entered a phase of high-level transmission where a multipronged approach to implementing all evidence-based public health strategies at both the individual and community levels is essential. This summary guidance highlights critical evidence-based CDC recommendations and sustainable strategies to reduce COVID-19 transmission. These strategies include 1) universal face mask use, 2) maintaining physical distance from other persons and limiting in-person contacts, 3) avoiding nonessential indoor spaces and crowded outdoor spaces, 4) increasing testing to rapidly identify and isolate infected persons, 5) promptly identifying, quarantining, and testing close contacts of persons with known COVID-19, 6) safeguarding persons most at risk for severe illness or death from infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, 7) protecting essential workers with provision of adequate personal protective equipment and safe work practices, 8) postponing travel, 9) increasing room air ventilation and enhancing hand hygiene and environmental disinfection, and 10) achieving widespread availability and high community coverage with effective COVID-19 vaccines. In combination, these strategies can reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission, long-term sequelae or disability, and death, and mitigate the pandemic's economic impact. Consistent implementation of these strategies improves health equity, preserves health care capacity, maintains the function of essential businesses, and supports the availability of in-person instruction for kindergarten through grade 12 schools and preschool. Individual persons, households, and communities should take these actions now to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission from its current high level. These actions will provide a bridge to a future with wide availability and high community coverage of effective vaccines, when safe return to more everyday activities in a range of settings will be possible.","Honein, Margaret A; Christie, Athalia; Rose, Dale A; Brooks, John T; Meaney-Delman, Dana; Cohn, Amanda; Sauber-Schatz, Erin K; Walker, Allison; McDonald, L Clifford; Liburd, Leandris C; Hall, Jeffrey E; Fry, Alicia M; Hall, Aron J; Gupta, Neil; Kuhnert, Wendi L; Yoon, Paula W; Gundlapalli, Adi V; Beach, Michael J; Walke, Henry T",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,476

A team of radiologists and medical physicists performed 25 phantom CT studies using different automatic tube current modulation settings (SUREExposure3D technology). We then conducted a retrospective evaluation of the chest CT images from 22 patients with COVID-19 and calculated the density difference between the GGO and unaffected tissue. Finally, the results were matched to the phantom study results to determine the minimum noise index threshold value. The minimum density difference at the onset of COVID-19 was 252 HU (p < 0.001). This was found to correspond to the SUREExposure 3D noise index of 36. We established the noise index threshold of 36 for the Canon scanner without iterative reconstructions, allowing for a decrease in the dose-length product by 80%.

Method: A cross-national survey was conducted in both China and the United States, and discrete choice experiments, as well as Likert scales, were utilized to assess vaccine preference and the underlying factors contributing to vaccination acceptance. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to enable a direct comparison between the two countries. Results: A total of 9077 (5375 and 3702 from China and the United States, respectively) respondents completed the survey. After propensity score matching, over 82.0% of respondents from China positively accepted the COVID-19 vaccination, while 72.2% of respondents from the United States positively accepted it. Specifically, only 31.9% of Chinese respondents were recommended by a doctor to have COVID-19 vaccination, while more than half of the U.S. respondents were recommended by a doctor (50.2%), local health board (59.4%), or friends and families (64.8%). The discrete choice experiments revealed that respondents from the United States attached the greatest importance to the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines (44.41%), followed by the cost of vaccination (29.57%), whereas those from China held a different viewpoint, that the cost of vaccination covered the largest proportion in their trade-off (30.66%), and efficacy ranked as the second most important attribute (26.34%). Additionally, respondents from China tended to be much more concerned about the adverse effect of vaccination (19.68% vs. 6.12%) and have a lower perceived severity of being infected with COVID-19. Conclusion: Although the overall acceptance and hesitancy of COVID-19 vaccination in both countries are high, underpinned distinctions between these countries were observed. Owing to the differences in COVID-19 incidence rates, cultural backgrounds, and the availability of specific COVID-19 vaccines in the two countries, vaccine rollout strategies should be nation-dependent.","Liu, Taoran He Zonglin Huang Jian Yan Ni Chen Qian Huang Fengqiu Zhang Yuejia Akinwunmi Omolola M.; Akinwunmi, Babatunde O.; Zhang, Casper J.

307306,CoAID: COVID-19 Healthcare Misinformation Dataset,2020-05-22,"RATIONALE: Both 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) and SARS-CoV-2 are transmitted by respiratory secretions and in severe cases result in a viral pneumonitis, requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. However, no studies have compared the clinical characteristics and outcomes of such patients. OBJECTIVES: To report and compare the demographic characteristics, treatments, use of critical care resources, and outcomes of patients admitted to an Australian ICU with H1N1 influenza during the winter of 2009, and SARS-CoV-2, during the winter of 2020. METHODS: This was a multicentre project, utilizing national data from previous and ongoing epidemiological studies concerning severe acute respiratory infections in Australia. All ICUs admitting patients with H1N1 or COVID-19 were included and contributed data. We compared clinical characteristics and outcomes of H1N1 patients admitted to ICU in the winter of 2009 vs COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU in the winter of 2020. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Potential years of life lost (PYLL) was calculated according to sex-adjusted life expectancy in Australia. RESULTS: Across the two epochs, 861 patients were admitted to ICUs; 236 (27.4%) with COVID-19, and 625 (72.6%) with H1N1 influenza. The number of ICU admissions and bed-days occupied were higher with 2009 H1N1 influenza. COVID-19 patients were older, more often male and overweight, and had lower APACHE 2 at ICU admission. The highest age-specific incidence of ICU admission was among infants (0 to 1 year of age) for H1N1, and among the elderly (&#8805; 65 years) for COVID-19. Unadjusted in-hospital mortality was similar (11.5% in COVID-19 vs. 16.1% in H1N1; odds ratio, 0.68 [95% confidence interval, 0.42 to 1.06]; p = 0.10). The PYLL was greater with H1N1 influenza than with COVID-19 at 154.1 (95% CI, 148.7 to 159.4) vs 13.6 (95% CI, 12.2 to 15.1) PYLL per million inhabitants. CONCLUSIONS: In comparison to 2009 H1N1 influenza, COVID-19 admissions over winter in Australia resulted in fewer ICU admissions, and lower bed-day occupancy. Crude in-hospital mortality was similar, but because of demographic differences in affected patients, deaths due to 2009 H1N1 influenza led to an 11-fold increase in the number of PYLL in critically ill patients.","Serpa Neto, Ary; Burrell, Aidan Jc; Bailey, Michael; Broadley, Tessa; Cooper, D Jamie; French, Craig J; Pilcher, David; Plummer, Mark P; Trapani, Tony; Webb, Steve A; Bellomo, Rinaldo; Udy, Andrew",Ann.

While entrepreneurship and PBL in SE education are thrilling research topics, there seems to be very little work focusing on the pros and cons of involving external stakeholders to support real demands in software engineering education. Working on real projects also supports students to acquire leadership skills, such as communication, project management, and teamwork. This paper describes a case study integrating students from different Software Engineering programs and involving external stakeholders, underpinned by PBL concepts. We present how this study was designed and implemented in a large institution, in four steps, summarized as follows: (I) requirements gathering and design; (II) information system development and implementation; (III) integration tests and deployment process; (IV) support and maintenance activities. The study had the participation of 59 students from a professional technical course in step one, working in teams, and 10 undergraduate students from a Bachelor's program in Information Systems in the following steps, working in pairs. Overall, the feedback from stakeholders and students exceeded expectations, although it increased the workload of teachers. We were able to distill a new set of lessons learned, and we expect that at least some of them will be useful for anyone implementing a similar course.

First, we propose a set of commands commonly used for human-robot interaction. Next, an online user study with 190 participants was performed to investigate if there was an agreed set of gestures that people intuitively use to communicate the given commands to robots when no guidance or training were given. As we found large variations among the gestures exist between participants, we then proposed a set of gestures for the proposed commands to be used as a common foundation for robot interaction. We collected ~7500 video demonstrations of the proposed gestures and trained a gesture recognition model, adapting 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) as the classifier, with a final accuracy of 84.1% (sigma=2.4). The resulting model was capable of training successfully with a relatively small amount of training data. We integrated the gesture recognition model into the ROS framework and report details for a demonstrated use case, where a person commands a robot to perform a pick and place task using the proposed set. This integrated ROS gesture recognition system is made available for use, and built with the intention to allow for new adaptations depending on robot model and use case scenarios, for novel user applications.","Tan, Jia Chuan A.; Chan, Wesley P.; Robinson, Nicole L.; Croft, Elizabeth A.; Kulic, Dana",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.09908v1.pdf,476

The magnitude of the associations was estimated using Spearman's correlation coefficient and multiple regression analysis. RESULTS: In the Brazilian states, 59.8% of variation in the incidence of COVID-19 was justified by income inequality, significant home densification, and higher mortality. In the case of mortality, those same variables explained 57.9% of the country's variations in federal units. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that socioeconomic factors influenced the evolution and impact of COVID-19 in Brazil. Thus, we suggest comprehensive actions to ensure economic conditions and strengthening of health networks for populations with socioeconomic vulnerability.","Figueiredo, Alexandre Medeiros de; Figueiredo, Daniela Cristina Moreira Marculino de; Gomes, Luciano Bezerra; Massuda, Adriano; Gil-García, Eugenia; Vianna, Rodrigo Pinheiro de Toledo; Daponte, Antonio",Rev Bras Enferm,,476

311829,How International Governmental COVID-19 Measures Impacted Freedom of Speech Around the World (preprint),2021,"Developing antiviral drugs is an exigent task since viruses mutate to overcome the effect of antiviral drugs. As a result, the efficacy of most antiviral drugs is short-lived. To include this effect, we modify the Neumann and Dahari model. Considering the fact that the efficacy of the antiviral drug varies in time, the differential equations introduced in the previous model systems are rewritten to study the correlation between the viral load and antiviral drug. The effect of antiviral drug that either prevents infection or stops the production of a virus is explored. First, the efficacy of the drug is considered to decreases monotonously as time progresses. In this case, our result depicts that when the efficacy of the drug is low, the viral load decreases and increases back in time revealing the effect of the antiviral drugs is short-lived. On the other hand, for the antiviral drug with high efficacy, the viral load, as well as the number of infected cells, monotonously decreases while the number of uninfected cells increases. The dependence of the critical drug efficacy on time is also explored. Moreover, the correlation between viral load, the antiviral drug, and CTL response is also explored. In this case, not only the dependence for the basic reproduction ratio on the model parameters is explored but also we analyze the critical drug efficacy as a function of time. We show that the term related to the basic reproduction ratio increases when the CTL response step up. A simple analytically solvable mathematical model is also presented to analyze the correlation between viral load and antiviral drugs.","Taye, Mesfin Asfaw",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.10413v1.pdf,476

312109,A mind of care: Responding ethically to COVID-19,2020,"INTRODUCTION: DL-3-hydroxy-3-phenylpentanamide (HEPP) and DL-3-hydroxy-3-(4'chlorophenyl)-pentanamide (Cl-HEPP) are phenyl-alcohol-amides that are metabotropic GABAB receptor (MGBR) antagonists and protective against absence seizures. This study aims to further characterize the anticonvulsant profile of these drugs. METHODS: HEPP and Cl-HEPP were evaluated in various standardized acute seizure and toxic tests in female Swiss-OF1 mice. RESULTS: Toxicities of HEPP and Cl-HEPP were limited; doses up to 30 mg/kg did not result in hypothermia, reduced spontaneous locomotor activity, or failure of the rotarod test, with doses >15 mg/kg potentiating pentobarbital-induced sleep. In maximal electroshock-induced seizures, 20 mg/kg Cl-HEPP protected 100 % of mice; lower doses shortened post-ictal recovery. Seizure protection occurred against subcutaneous pentylenetetrazole and picrotoxin, being limited against N-methyl-d-aspartate. In bicuculline test, clonic or fatal tonic seizures were decreased, onset delayed, and recovery improved; ED50 values (dose protecting 50 % of the animals) were 37.5 and 25 mg/kg for HEPP and Cl-HEPP, respectively. In magnesium deficiency-dependent audiogenic seizures (MDDAS), ED50 values were 3 and 8 mg/kg for Cl-HEPP and HEPP, respectively. The components of MDDAS (latency, wild running, seizure, and recovery phases) in unprotected animals were only minimally affected by near ED50 doses of Cl-HEPP and HEPP. DISCUSSION: HEPP and, to a greater extent, Cl-HEPP provide anti-seizure protections in several acute seizure tests in mice at nontoxic doses. These results are consistent with the action of these drugs on diverse molecular targets directly resulting from their MGBR antagonistic properties. However, other mechanisms might occur possibly for the protection given in the MES test.

312575,Pregnancy and Postpartum Challenges During COVID-19 for African-African Women,2020,"BACKGROUND: The three main alleles of the APOE gene (Îµ4, Îµ3 and Îµ2) carry differential risks for conditions including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cardiovascular disease. Due to their clinical significance, we explored disease associations of the APOE genotypes using a hypothesis-free, data-driven, phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) approach. METHODS: We used data from the UK Biobank to screen for associations between APOE genotypes and over 950 disease outcomes using genotype Îµ3Îµ3 as a reference. Data was restricted to 337,484 white British participants (aged 37-73 years). FINDINGS: After correction for multiple testing, PheWAS analyses identified associations with 37 outcomes, representing 18 distinct diseases. As expected, Îµ3Îµ4 and Îµ4Îµ4 genotypes associated with increased odds of AD (p &#8804; 7.6 × 10-46), hypercholesterolaemia (p &#8804; 7.1 × 10-17) and ischaemic heart disease (p &#8804; 2.3 × 10-4), while Îµ2Îµ3 provided protection for the latter two conditions (p &#8804; 3.7 × 10-10) compared to Îµ3Îµ3. In contrast, Îµ4-associated disease protection was seen against obesity, chronic airway obstruction, type 2 diabetes, gallbladder disease, and liver disease (all p &#8804; 5.2 × 10-4) while Îµ2Îµ2 homozygosity increased risks of peripheral vascular disease, thromboembolism, arterial aneurysm, peptic ulcer, cervical disorders, and hallux valgus (all p &#8804; 6.1 × 10-4). Sensitivity analyses using brain neuroimaging, blood biochemistry, anthropometric, and spirometric biomarkers supported the PheWAS findings on APOE associations with respective disease outcomes. INTERPRETATION: PheWAS confirms strong associations between APOE and AD, hypercholesterolaemia, and ischaemic heart disease, and suggests potential Îµ4-associated disease protection and harmful effects of the Îµ2Îµ2 genotype, for several conditions.

BACKGROUND: Frontline medical staff are prone to follow-up mental health problems and different feeling after COVID-19 rescue task. However, the experience of frontline nurses after COVID-19 rescue task has not been well described. METHODS: The study used a qualitative study design with semi-structured interview guide. Individual semi-structured face-to-face interviews were conducted with 15 frontline nurses who were involved COVID-19 rescue task from two tertiary-A hospitals in Hefei, China from July 10, to August 28, 2020. We followed the consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research (COREQ) checklist. RESULTS: Four main themes emerged from the interviews: recurring involuntary memories about the experience, feeling guilty and depressed, cultivation of occupational ability, increased professional pride and happiness. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated that frontline nurses had both positive and negative experiences four months after COVID-19 rescue task. It is necessary to long-term follow up and attention to the experience of the frontline nurses after COVID-19 rescue task. These insights provide a specific direction for the psychological reconstruction of frontline nurses and the construction of nursing team. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nursing managers should formulate psychological reconstruction plan according to the experience of frontline nurses after COVID-19 rescue task, so as to relieve the psychological stress and promote the mental health of nurses. At the same time, we should strengthen the disaster rescue ability training of nurses should be strengthened to better respond to future rescue task.","Zhang, Xi; Sheng, Qingqing; Wang, Xinyu; Cai, Chunfeng",Arch Psychiatr Nurs,,476

At the end of March 2020, the first and so far largest outbreak of the disease occurred in a retirement home in Hamburg. Methods: Analysis of procedures in dealing with a residential unit affected by SARS-CoV­2, accommodating a risk group of 60 seniors with dementia is presented as well as a detailed presentation of post-mortem examination results of all 8 deceased tested positive for SARS-CoV­2. Results: Out of 60 residents, 39 were infected by SARS-CoV­2. Due to preventive procedures it was possible to stop further spreading of the infection to other residential areas. In all 8 fatal cases, the autopsy diagnosis was death due to COVID-19. Autopsies revealed all COVID-19 patients to have a fatal (broncho)pneumonia and signs of relevant pre-existing cardiac, renal and pulmonary conditions in all cases. In 75% (nâ¯= 6) of the cases a fresh venous thrombosis was found. In 66.7% (nâ¯= 4) of the cases thrombotic events were combined with peripheral pulmonary artery thromboembolisms. Conclusion: The cohort of SARS-CoV­2 infected residents of a nursing home is characteristic for clinical and epidemiological features of the new coronavirus disease. Due to a centralized evaluation of all fatalities at the Institute of Legal Medicine in Hamburg, a detailed examination of all deceased positive for SARS-CoV­2 was possible. Thereby, increased case fatality rates of approximately 20% could in all cases be assigned to a relevant number of pre-existing comorbidities of multiple organ systems, which was consistent with the clinical data available.","Klein, A; Edler, C; Fitzek, A; Fröb, D; Heinemann, A; Meißner, K; Mushumba, H; Püschel, K; Schröder, A S; Sperhake, J P; Ishorst-Witte, F; Aepfelbacher, M; Heinrich, F",Rechtsmedizin (Berl),,476

METHODS: We examined the budget for research projects relating to the number of cases and deaths and the relationship between each federal unit, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, and the national GDP per capita. RESULTS: Using data from the websites of official funding agencies and the Brazilian government, we found that, in the first four months since the first case in Wuhan, China (December 31, 2019), around US$ 38.3 million were directed to public funding for scientific investigations against the COVID-19 pandemic. However, only 11 out of 27 federal units provided funding during the initial stages of the outbreak, and those that did provide financing were not necessarily the units having the most inhabitants, highest GDP, or the greatest number of cases. The areas of research interest were also identified in the funding documents; the most common topic was ""diagnosis"" and the least common was ""equipment for treatment."" CONCLUSIONS: Brazilian researchers had access to funding opportunities for projects against COVID-19. However, strategies to minimize the economic impacts of COVID-19 are crucial in mitigating or avoiding substantial financial and social shortcomings, particularly in terms of an emerging market such as Brazil.","Campo, Kaio Niitsu; Rodrigues, Isabella Caroline Pereira; Lopes, Éder Sócrates Najar; Gabriel, Laís Pellizzer",Rev Soc Bras Med Trop,,476

We investigated whether making meaning in negative experiences (MINE) would help people cope with COVID-19. We conducted a three-wave longitudinal study (N = 2364) three months before, during, and after the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Results showed that participants reported increased tendency of MINE during the COVID-19 outbreak than three months before the outbreak. Moreover, both initial MINE and the increased MINE predict less psychological distress including depression, anxiety, and stress, during and three months after the outbreak. Perceived benefits and costs of the COVID-19 mediated the long-term effect. These findings not only provide novel evidence for the meaning making model but also shed light on the underlying mechanism, suggesting an effective strategy to cope with stressful events such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Yang, Ziyan; Ji, Li-Jun; Yang, Ying; Wang, Yuqi; Zhu, Lifang; Cai, Huajian",Pers Individ Dif,,476

315336,Public libraries in times of Covid-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has been growing exponentially, affecting over 4 million people and causing enormous distress to economies and societies worldwide. A plethora of analyses based on viral sequences has already been published both in scientific journals and through non-peer-reviewed channels to investigate the genetic heterogeneity and spatiotemporal dissemination of SARS-CoV-2. However, a systematic investigation of phylogenetic information and sampling bias in the available data is lacking. Although the number of available genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 is growing daily and the sequences show increasing phylogenetic information, country-specific data still present severe limitations and should be interpreted with caution. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the quality of the currently available SARS-CoV-2 full genome data in terms of sampling bias as well as phylogenetic and temporal signals to inform and guide the scientific community. METHODS: We used maximum likelihood-based methods to assess the presence of sufficient information for robust phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies in several SARS-CoV-2 sequence alignments assembled from GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data) data released between March and April 2020. RESULTS: Although the number of high-quality full genomes is growing daily, and sequence data released in April 2020 contain sufficient phylogenetic information to allow reliable inference of phylogenetic relationships, country-specific SARS-CoV-2 data sets still present severe limitations. CONCLUSIONS: At the present time, studies assessing within-country spread or transmission clusters should be considered preliminary or hypothesis-generating at best. Hence, current reports should be interpreted with caution, and concerted efforts should continue to increase the number and quality of sequences required for robust tracing of the epidemic.","Mavian, Carla; Marini, Simone; Prosperi, Mattia; Salemi, Marco",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,476

This paper examines the public's knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) related to COVID-19 and their relationships and identified the pandemic's vulnerable populations to provide recommendations for behavioral interventions and policies. METHODS: Data collection took place over 3 days (June 26-29) via an online survey 5 months after the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) confirmed the first COVID case in South Korea; 970 subjects were included in the statistical data analysis. RESULTS: Knowledge directly affected both attitudes (e.g., perceived risk and efficacy belief) and practices (e.g., personal hygiene practices and social distancing). Among the influencing factors of COVID-19 preventive behaviors, efficacy belief was the most influential and significant practice factor. It mediated the relationship between knowledge and all three preventive behaviors (wearing facial masks, practicing hand hygiene, and avoiding crowded places). The level of knowledge varied by sociodemographic characteristics. Females (ß = 0.06, p < 0.05) and individuals with higher levels of education (ß = 0.06, p < 0.05) demonstrated higher levels of knowledge. CONCLUSION: To increase precautionary behaviors among the public, health officials and policymakers must promote knowledge and efficacy belief. Future interventions and policies should also be developed in a 'person-centered' approach, targeting vulnerable subgroups, embracing them, and closing the gap of KAP toward COVID-19.","Lee, Minjung; Kang, Bee-Ah; You, Myoungsoon",BMC Public Health,,476

Our work was designed to monitor the longitudinal dynamics of the metabolomic response of blood plasma and to reveal presumable discrimination in patients with positive and negative outcomes of COVID-19 respiratory symptoms. Methods: Blood plasma from patients, divided into subgroups with positive (survivors) and negative (worsening condition, non-survivors) outcomes, on Days 1, 3, and 7 after admission to hospital, was measured by NMR spectroscopy. Results: We observed changes in energy metabolism in both groups of COVID-19 patients;initial hyperglycaemia, indicating lowered glucose utilisation, was balanced with increased production of 3-hydroxybutyrate as an alternative energy source and accompanied by accelerated protein catabolism manifested by an increase in BCAA levels. These changes were normalised in patients with positive outcome by the seventh day, but still persisted one week after hospitalisation in patients with negative outcome. The initially decreased glutamine plasma level normalised faster in patients with positive outcome. Patients with negative outcome showed a more pronounced Phe/Tyr ratio, which is related to exacerbated and generalised inflammatory processes. Almost ideal discrimination from controls was proved. Conclusions: Distinct metabolomic responses to severe inflammation initiated by SARS-CoV-2 infection may serve towards complementary personalised pharmacological and nutritional support to improve patient outcomes.","Baranovicova, Eva Bobcakova Anna Vysehradsky Robert Dankova Zuzana Halasova Erika Nosal Vladimir Lehotsky Jan",Applied Sciences,,476

317262,Modeling and forecasting of confirmed and recovered cases of COVID-19 in India,2020,"The United States experienced historically high numbers of measles cases in 2019, despite achieving national measles vaccination rates above the World Health Organization recommendation of 95% coverage with two doses. Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, resulting in suspension of many clinical preventive services, pediatric vaccination rates in the United States have fallen precipitously, dramatically increasing risk of measles resurgence. Previous research has shown that measles outbreaks in high-coverage contexts are driven by spatial clustering of nonvaccination, which decreases local immunity below the herd immunity threshold. However, little is known about how to best conduct surveillance and target interventions to detect and address these high-risk areas, and most vaccination data are reported at the state-level-a resolution too coarse to detect community-level clustering of nonvaccination characteristic of recent outbreaks. In this paper, we perform a series of computational experiments to assess the impact of clustered nonvaccination on outbreak potential and magnitude of bias in predicting disease risk posed by measuring vaccination rates at coarse spatial scales. We find that, when nonvaccination is locally clustered, reporting aggregate data at the state- or county-level can result in substantial underestimates of outbreak risk. The COVID-19 pandemic has shone a bright light on the weaknesses in US infectious disease surveillance and a broader gap in our understanding of how to best use detailed spatial data to interrupt and control infectious disease transmission. Our research clearly outlines that finer-scale vaccination data should be collected to prevent a return to endemic measles transmission in the United States.","Masters, Nina B; Eisenberg, Marisa C; Delamater, Paul L; Kay, Matthew; Boulton, Matthew L; Zelner, Jon",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,,476
317635,Vulnerability of personality disorder during the Covid-19 crises - a multicenter survey of treatment experiences among patients referred to treatment,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic led to unprecedented mitigation efforts that disrupted the daily lives of millions Beyond the general health repercussions of the pandemic itself, these measures also present a challenge to the world's mental health and health care systems Considering that traditional survey methods are time-consuming and expensive, we need timely and proactive data sources to respond to the rapidly evolving effects of health policy on our population's mental health Many people in the United States now use social media platforms such as Twitter to express the most minute details of their daily lives and social relations This behavior is expected to increase during the COVID-19 pandemic, rendering social media data a rich field to understand personal well-being OBJECTIVE: This study aims to answer three research questions: (1) What themes emerge from a corpus of US tweets about COVID-19? (2) To what extent did social media use increase during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic? and (3) Does sentiment change in response to the COVID-19 pandemic? METHODS: We analyzed 86,581,237 public domain English language US tweets collected from an open-access public repository in three steps First, we characterized the evolution of hashtags over time using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling Second, we increased the granularity of this analysis by downloading Twitter timelines of a large cohort of individuals (n=354,738) in 20 major US cities to assess changes in social media use Finally, using this timeline data, we examined collective shifts in public mood in relation to evolving pandemic news cycles by analyzing the average daily sentiment of all timeline tweets with the Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner (VADER) tool RESULTS: LDA topics generated in the early months of the data set corresponded to major COVID-19-specific events However, as state and municipal governments began issuing stay-at-home orders, latent themes shifted toward US-related lifestyle changes rather than global pandemic-related events Social media volume also increased significantly, peaking during stay-at-home mandates Finally, VADER sentiment analysis scores of user timelines were initially high and stable but decreased significantly, and continuously, by late March CONCLUSIONS: Our findings underscore the negative effects of the pandemic on overall population sentiment Increased use rates suggest that, for some, social media may be a coping mechanism to combat feelings of isolation related to long-term social distancing However, in light of the documented negative effect of heavy social media use on mental health, social media may further exacerbate negative feelings in the long-term for many individuals Thus, considering the overburdened US mental health care structure, these findings have important implications for ongoing mitigation efforts","Valdez, D.; Ten Thij, M.; Bathina, K.; Rutter, L.

In particular, women were reported to be at higher risk than men of developing symptoms of stress/anxiety/depression, and resilience was considered a key factor for positive mental health outcomes. In the present study, a sample of Italian female teachers (n = 66, age: 51.5 ± 7.9 years) was assessed with self-report instruments one month before and one month after the start of the Covid-19 lockdown: mindfulness skills, empathy, personality profiles, interoceptive awareness, psychological well-being, emotional distress and burnout levels were measured. Meanwhile, they received an 8-week Mindfulness-Oriented Meditation (MOM) course, through two group meetings and six individual video-lessons. Based on baseline personality profiles, analyses of variance were performed in a low-resilience (LR, n = 32) and a high-resilience (HR, n = 26) group. The LR and HR groups differed at baseline in most of the self-report measures. Pre-post MOM significant improvements were found in both groups in anxiety, depression, affective empathy, emotional exhaustion, psychological well-being, interoceptive awareness, character traits and mindfulness levels. Improvements in depression and psychological well-being were higher in the LR vs. HR group. We conclude that mindfulness-based training can effectively mitigate the psychological negative consequences of the Covid-19 outbreak, helping in particular to restore well-being in the most vulnerable individuals.","Matiz, Alessio; Fabbro, Franco; Paschetto, Andrea; Cantone, Damiano; Paolone, Anselmo Roberto; Crescentini, Cristiano",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,476
317780,Policy-Aware Mobility Model Explains the Growth of COVID-19 in Cities,2021-02-21,"BACKGROUND: Sedentary behaviors and physical activity are likely to be affected by the COVID-19 outbreak, and sedentary lifestyles can increase subjective fatigue. The nonpharmaceutical policies imposed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic may also have adverse effects on fatigue. OBJECTIVE: This study has two aims: to examine the changes in sedentary behaviors and physical activity of company workers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan and to examine relationships between changes in these sedentary behaviors and physical activity and changes in fatigue. METHODS: Data from a nationwide prospective online survey conducted in 2019 and 2020 were used. On February 22, 2019, an email with a link to participate in the study was sent to 45,659 workers, aged 20 to 59 years, who were randomly selected from a database of approximately 1 million individuals. A total of 2466 and 1318 participants, who self-reported their occupation as company workers, answered the baseline and follow-up surveys, respectively. Surveys captured fatigue, workday and daily domain-specific sedentary behaviors and physical activity, and total sedentary behaviors and physical activity. We used multivariable linear regression models to estimate associations of changes in sedentary behaviors and physical activity with changes in fatigue. RESULTS: Increases in public transportation sitting during workdays, other leisure sitting time during workdays, and other leisure sitting time were associated with an increase in the motivation aspect of fatigue (b=0.29, 95% CI 0-0.57, P=.048; b=0.40, 95% CI 0.18-0.62, P<.001; and b=0.26, 95% CI 0.07-0.45, P=.007, respectively). Increases in work-related sitting time during workdays, total sitting time during workdays, and total work-related sitting time were significantly associated with an increase in the physical activity aspect of fatigue (b=0.06, 95% CI 0-0.12, P=.03; b=0.05, 95% CI 0.01-0.09, P=.02; and b=0.07, 95% CI 0-0.14, P=.04, respectively). The motivation and physical activity aspects of fatigue increased by 0.06 for each 1-hour increase in total sitting time between baseline and follow-up (b=0.06, 95% CI 0-0.11, P=.045; and b=0.06, 95% CI 0.01-0.10, P=.009, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated that sedentary and active behaviors among company workers in Japan were negatively affected during the COVID-19 outbreak. Increases in several domain-specific sedentary behaviors also contributed to unfavorable changes in workers' fatigue. Social distancing and teleworking amid a pandemic may contribute to the sedentary lifestyle of company workers. Public health interventions are needed to mitigate the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or future pandemics on sedentary and physical activity behaviors and fatigue among company workers.","Koohsari, Mohammad Javad; Nakaya, Tomoki; McCormack, Gavin R; Shibata, Ai; Ishii, Kaori; Oka, Koichiro",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,476

COVID-19 and academic neurosurgery,2020,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review article presents the current knowledge on the use of telemedicine and summarizes the literature highlighting the advantages and limitations of this technology in the field of orthopedic surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. RECENT FINDINGS: Orthopedic surgery is the surgical specialty that has seen the highest proportion of its procedures cancelled due to the pandemic. In this context and onward, telemedicine seems to be a reasonable option for the orthopedic surgeon. Multiple studies have described its safety and a similar patient satisfaction compared to in-person consultations. It has a potential to increase productivity and decrease wait times by providing easier access to the clinician and by decreasing travel-associated limitations and costs. Authors have described the possibility to conduct a reliable virtual assessment of the patient range of motion. Some of the limitations to the use of this technology are technological literacy and access to virtual consultation platforms, the inability to conduct a complete physical examination, potential reduction in identification of intimate and child abuse victims, and limited knowledge about the legal implications of this technology. Telemedicine in orthopedic surgery has a potential to increase productivity, reduce costs, and increase the access to healthcare. Identified limitations include risk of misdiagnosis, required technologic literacy, unknown legal implications, and failure to identify victims of abuse. In order to use this technology judiciously, the clinician must take into consideration the patient's condition and his technological literacy and be aware of the advantages and disadvantages.","Moisan, Philippe; Barimani, Bardia; Antoniou, John",,,476

Predictors and consequences of reliance on different evidence types during the COVID-19 infodemic",2021,"After a period of rapidly declining U.S. COVID-19 incidence during January-March 2021, increases occurred in several jurisdictions (1,2) despite the rapid rollout of a large-scale vaccination program. This increase coincided with the spread of more transmissible variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, including B.1.1.7 (1,3) and relaxation of COVID-19 prevention strategies such as those for businesses, large-scale gatherings, and educational activities. To provide long-term projections of potential trends in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub teams used a multiple-model approach comprising six models to assess the potential course of COVID-19 in the United States across four scenarios with different vaccination coverage rates and effectiveness estimates and strength and implementation of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) (public health policies, such as physical distancing and masking) over a 6-month period (April-September 2021) using data available through March 27, 2021 (4). Among the four scenarios, an accelerated decline in NPI adherence (which encapsulates NPI mandates and population behavior) was shown to undermine vaccination-related gains over the subsequent 2-3 months and, in combination with increased transmissibility of new variants, could lead to surges in cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. A sharp decline in cases was projected by July 2021, with a faster decline in the high-vaccination scenarios. High vaccination rates and compliance with public health prevention measures are essential to control the COVID-19 pandemic and to prevent surges in hospitalizations and deaths in the coming months.","Borchering, Rebecca K; Viboud, Cécile; Howerton, Emily; Smith, Claire P; Truelove, Shaun; Runge, Michael C; Reich, Nicholas G; Contamin, Lucie; Levander, John; Salerno, Jessica; van Panhuis, Wilbert; Kinsey, Matt; Tallaksen, Kate; Obrecht, R Freddy; Asher, Laura; Costello, Cash; Kelbaugh, Michael; Wilson, Shelby; Shin, Lauren; Gallagher, Molly E; Mullany, Luke C; Rainwater-Lovett, Kaitlin; Lemaitre, Joseph C; Dent, Juan; Grantz, Kyra H; Kaminsky, Joshua; Lauer, Stephen A; Lee, Elizabeth C; Meredith, Hannah R; Perez-Saez, Javier; Keegan, Lindsay T; Karlen, Dean; Chinazzi, Matteo; Davis, Jessica T; Mu, Kunpeng; Xiong, Xinyue; Pastore Y Piontti, Ana; Vespignani, Alessandro; Srivastava, Ajitesh; Porebski, Przemyslaw; Venkatramanan, Srinivasan; Adiga, Aniruddha; Lewis, Bryan; Klahn, Brian; Outten, Joseph; Schlitt, James; Corbett, Patrick; Telionis, Pyrros Alexander; Wang, Lijing; Peddireddy, Akhil Sai",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,476
318344,Telemedicina aplicada a COVID-19./ Telemedicina aplicada a COVID-19./ Telemedicine for COVID-19,2020,"This review reports on recent advances in our knowledge about the stability of binary colloids. We focus not only on experimental results but also discuss theoretical and simulation studies regarding kinetic and structural aspects of heteroaggregation processes arising in such systems. In the first part of this work, heteroaggregation of oppositely charged particles is reviewed. When the interactions are short ranged, binary diffusion-limited cluster-cluster aggregation takes place. In this case, the short time behavior of the system follows the Hogg, Healy and Fuerstenau (HHF) theory. At long times, however, stable aggregates may form and remain in the system. Furthermore, cluster discrimination is observed, clusters that differ only by one constituent particle were found to behave quite differently. When the range of the interactions is increased, the latter effects become more pronounced. The fractal dimension of heteroaggregates is, in general, smaller than the values reported for fast and slow homoaggregation processes. In some cases, even values close to unity were obtained. This means that heteroaggregates have an open branched structure that may approach a chain-like morphology. In the second part of this work, we briefly discuss similar effects arising in heteroaggregation phenomena due to differences in particle size and chemical composition. The third part of this review tackles recent developments in the field of equilibrium phase diagrams of binary colloids. In the last section, the relatively small number of papers about heteroaggregation processes in two-dimensional systems is also discussed.","López-López, J M; Schmitt, A; Moncho-Jordá, A; Hidalgo-Álvarez, R",Soft Matter,,476

321200,Dynamic changes in coagulation parameters and correlation with disease severity and mortality in patients with COVID-19,2021,"Due to the rapidly developing nature of the current COVID-19 outbreak and its almost immediate humanitarian and economic toll, coronavirus drug discovery efforts have largely focused on generating potential COVID-19 drug candidates as quickly as possible. Globally, scientists are working day and night to find the best possible solution to treat the deadly virus. During the first few months of 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak quickly developed into a pandemic, with a mortality rate that was increasing at an exponential rate day by day. As a result, scientists have turned to a drug repurposing approach, to rediscover the potential use and benefits of existing approved drugs. Currently, there is no single drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), for the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, previously known as 2019-nCoV) that causes COVID-19. Based on only in-vitro studies, several active drugs are already in the clinical pipeline, made possible by following the compassionate use of medicine protocols. This method of repurposing and the use of existing molecules like Remdesivir (GS-5734), Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine, etc. has proven to be a landmark in the field of drug rediscovery. In this review article we will discuss the repurposing of medicines for treating the deadly novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).","Sanghai, Nitesh; Shafiq, Kashfia; Tranmer, Geoffrey K",Mini-reviews in medicinal chemistry (Online),,476
321402,"COVID-19: the turning point for gender equality (vol 398, pg 471, 2021)",2021,"More than 2 million SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences have been generated and shared since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and constitute a vital information source that informs outbreak control, disease surveillance, and public health policy. The Pango dynamic nomenclature is a popular system for classifying and naming genetically-distinct lineages of SARS-CoV-2, including variants of concern, and is based on the analysis of complete or near-complete virus genomes. However, for several reasons, nucleotide sequences may be generated that cover only the spike gene of SARS-CoV-2. It is therefore important to understand how much information about Pango lineage status is contained in spike-only nucleotide sequences. Here we explore how Pango lineages might be reliably designated and assigned to spike-only nucleotide sequences. We survey the genetic diversity of such sequences, and investigate the information they contain about Pango lineage status. Although many lineages, including the main variants of concern, can be identified clearly using spike-only sequences, some spike-only sequences are shared among tens or hundreds of Pango lineages. To facilitate the classification of SARS-CoV-2 lineages using subgenomic sequences we introduce the notion of designating such sequences to a ""lineage set"", which represents the range of Pango lineages that are consistent with the observed mutations in a given spike sequence. These data provide a foundation for the development of software tools that can assign newly-generated spike nucleotide sequences to Pango lineage sets.","Pybus, Oliver; Abram, Michael E; Kelly, Elizabeth J; Rambaut, Andrew",,,476
321492,The Politicization of COVID-19,2020,"Sustainability cannot exist without the actual engine driving it: the active people, involved in the socio-economic sectors and who decide, finally, through various means whether economic policies addressing pressing concerns are feasible and acceptable, or not. The issue of the relationship between sustainability, labor market, and corporate governance needs to be addressed from a complex, holistic perspective combining both heterodox and orthodox economic perspectives considering the reality of COVID-19 as game-changer. The current pandemic has raised the issue of the necessity of ‘renegotiating’ the institutional-economic status-quo on labor markets showing the need of closer links between economic and social perspectives more than ever, especially with emphasis on the vulnerable groups. The chapter intends to analyze how operational terms at strategic institutional and economic policy level might support or hinder initiatives of preserving jobs and ensuring labor market resilience, while accomplishing the overall objectives of sustainable development. The methodology relies on desk research, based on empirical data collected in various international and European databases as well as on articles, papers, and working papers published by national and international academic and business journals, as well as in daily newspapers and will use to equal extent findings according to orthodox economy, combining them with findings resulting from the use of institutional indicators’ measurement, thus providing an innovative perspective for the EU-level and national labor market, with respect to the labor market, and to the internal labor market, by considering developments in corporate governance. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.","Țîrcă, D.

321695,Using demographic data to understand the distribution of H1N1 and COVID-19 pandemics cases among federal entities and municipalities of Mexico,2021,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to explore the perceived effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) social distancing restrictions and safety measures on people with hearing loss. DESIGN: Participants were 129 adults (48.1% female, mean age 64.4 years) with an audiometric hearing loss, living in Glasgow, Scotland. A rapidly deployed 24-item online questionnaire asked about the effects of certain aspects of lockdown, including face masks, social distancing, and video calling, on participants' behavior, emotions, hearing performance, practical issues, and tinnitus. Data were analyzed descriptively across the entire sample, and with Chi-squared tests for differences between subgroups self-reporting relatively good and relatively poor unaided hearing, respectively. Additional free-text responses provided further perspectives. RESULTS: Behavior: Video calls are used more frequently than prelockdown. The better-hearing group use their hearing aids less. Emotions: There is increased anxiety (especially among the worse hearing group) concerning verbal communication situations and access to audiology services, and greater rumination about one's own hearing loss. Enjoyment of group video calls is mixed. The worse hearing group shows substantial relief at not being obliged to attend challenging social gatherings. Across both groups, a majority would like to see all key workers equipped with transparent face masks. Hearing performance: A large majority finds it hard to converse with people in face masks due to muffled sound and lack of speechreading cues, but conversing at a safe distance is not universally problematic. In the worse hearing group, performance in video calls is generally inferior to face-to-face, but similar to telephone calls. Those who use live subtitling in video calls appreciate their value. TV and radio updates about Covid-19 are easy to follow for most respondents. There is only weak evidence of face mask fixtures interfering with hearing aids on the ear, and of tinnitus having worsened during lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: With due regard for the limitations of this rapid study, we find that there are many negative-and a few positive-effects of Covid-19 restrictions and safety measures on people with hearing loss. From a societal perspective, the widespread adoption of clear face masks may alleviate some of the difficulties and anxieties this population experience. From an individual perspective, one may consider using live subtitles on video calls. Manufacturers of hearing devices should consider developing processing modes and accessories specifically designed for video calls. Finally, repair and maintenance services should be resumed as soon as it is safe to do so.","Naylor, Graham; Burke, Louise A; Holman, Jack A",Ear Hear,,476

322005,The app challenge against covid-19,2020,"Brazilian Federal Government created an emergency aid to face the COVID19 emergency. This aid provides monthly payments to low-income or unemployed citizens, informal workers, or individual micro-entrepreneurs. An intricate set of criteria made too complex the identification of all citizens eligible for emergency aid, considering there is no an integrated database to which they could apply these criteria. Consequently, lots of people who fulfilled the criteria were not able to receive the aid, and lots of people who were not supposed to get it ended up receiving it. In this context, the goal of this opinion paper is to discuss the process effectiveness and which issues related to information management hindered the positive program impact. Additionally, a less complex but relevant case of Rio Grande do Sul State is discussed. Both cases – the Federal Government and the state government – show the importance of effective information management to face very demanding situations and avoid the high social price to be paid by those who need this aid the most.","Luciano, Edimara M.",Int J Inf Manage,,476
322758,The Scientific Response to COVID-19 and Lessons for Security,2020,"Background: Most ambulatory oncology practices utilize an on-call service that is essential for continuity of cancer care after office hours, yet there is limited literature about the dynamics of this care delivery model and how to improve it from a quality standpoint We hypothesize that patients with more advanced cancers are more likely to require the oncall service due to acute symptoms arising during their treatment, and that this information can be used to create a risk model to predict subsequent hospitalization Methods: We performed a singlecenter, retrospective review of sequential overnight and weekend calls received by an oncology practice with 16 physicians over a 20-week period from January-May 2020 Calls were classified as being either urgent, requiring immediate attention, or nonurgent, which could be addressed during office hours Data were summarized using descriptive statistics, continuous and categorical variables were compared using Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Fisher's exact test, respectively Multivariate analyses were estimated by logistic regression using the penalized maximum likelihood estimation method Results: The data set included 236 consecutive calls among 176 patients, with 65% females and median age of 68 (range: 25-87) Of these, 185 calls (78 4%) were deemed urgent, among which 139 (75%) were symptom-related Among the 202 calls (85%) from patients with cancer, 164 (81%) of them were urgent, mostly due to symptoms (82%) Of these urgent calls, 44 (27%) resulted in admission within 24 hours (P &lt; 0 0001), primarily related to treatment toxicity or disease progression (81%) Patients with stage 4 cancers (42%) or hematologic malignancies (28%) were more likely to use the on-call service There was no significant difference between call urgency and treatment regimen (P = 0 06) In a multivariable model, advanced age [OR = 1 03(1 0-1 07)] and urgent calls [OR = 33 1(2 7-401 0)] were independently associated with risk of hospitalization Of note, there were no differences in admissions before or after the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City (P = 0 49) Conclusions: We identified an association between after-hours calls and more advanced malignancy, which was independent of treatment regimen The majority of on-call issues were urgent and symptom-related, with advanced age and urgent calls being most likely to result in hospital admission These results suggest that strategies can be developed to prevent hospitalizations in patients at higher-risk for adverse events based on a multivariable risk model","Wronska, M.

323135,COVID-19: students caught in Pakistan's digital divide,2020,"In the regime of domain classifications, the protein universe unveils a discrete set of folds connected by hierarchical relationships. Instead, at sub-domain-size resolution and because of physical constraints not necessarily requiring evolution to shape polypeptide chains, networks of protein motifs depict a continuous view that lies beyond the extent of hierarchical classification schemes. A number of studies, however, suggest that universal sub-sequences could be the descendants of peptides emerged in an ancient pre-biotic world. Should this be the case, evolutionary signals retained by structurally conserved motifs, along with hierarchical features of ancient domains, could sew relationships among folds that diverged beyond the point where homology is discernable. In view of the aforementioned, this paper provides a rationale where a network with hierarchical and continuous levels of the protein space, together with sequence profiles that probe the extent of sequence similarity and contacting residues that capture the transition from pre-biotic to domain world, has been used to explore relationships between ancient folds. Statistics of detected signals have been reported. As a result, an example of an emergent sub-network that makes sense from an evolutionary perspective, where conserved signals retrieved from the assessed protein space have been co-opted, has been discussed.","Gullotto, Danilo",Stat. appl. genet. mol. biol,,476

Its consequences are multifaceted and refer to individual and public physical, mental, and economic states. Therefore, viral outbreaks raise many fears and concerns, both among policymakers and individuals. In light of these fears, we explore the central aspects of viral victimization, compared to another significant threat of this century: terrorism. Analysis: There are many similarities between terrorism and the current pandemic which manifest within the physical, economic, social, and psychological aspects of victimization. To address the multidimensional nature of the pandemic's impact we coined the term viruism. Though terrorism and viruism are not the deadliest of threats, they evoke high levels of fear and cause enormous financial, social, and psychological effects. Conclusion: We recommend exploring the psychosocial mechanisms that account for public reaction to viruism. Identifying such mechanisms will contribute to developing more effective practices in managing the fear of viruism and in decreasing its emotional toll.

Accordingly, we aimed to examine their potential relationship with the novel biomarker of endothelial dysfunction, such as endocan in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), since there are no studies concerning this issue. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This case-control study included a total of 42 individuals with T2D and 64 diabetes-free participants. Serum endocan, lipid parameters, and lipoprotein subclasses were measured. RESULTS: Patients with T2D exhibited higher proportion of the smallest high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles HDL 3c, as compared with diabetes-free participants (p=0.047). Higher serum endocan levels in T2D patients with low small dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles (sdLDL) %, as compared with corresponding group of diabetes-free subjects was shown (p<0.01). Univariate binary logistic analysis revealed significant positive association of endocan and LDL diameter (OR=1.686, p=0.004), and negative associations of endocan with proportions of sdLDL (OR=0.928, p=0.007) and HDL3b (OR=0.789, p=0.009) particles. In a multivariate analysis, LDL diameter and proportions of sdLDL and HDL3b subclasses remained independent predictors of endocan levels in tested population. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study showed that larger LDL diameters, but lower sdLDL and HDL3b proportions were associated with higher endocan levels in population with T2D. More studies in the future are needed to confirm the observed relationship and to examine its causal nature.","Klisic, A; Kavaric, N; Vujcic, S; Mihajlovic, M; Zeljkovic, A; Ivanisevic, J; Spasojevic-Kalimanovska, V; Ninic, A; Kotur-Stevuljevic, J; Vekic, J",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,476

A simple point-of-care diagnostic test to screen for ventricular dysfunction would be clinically useful to guide management. We sought to review the clinical experience with an artificial intelligence electrocardiogram (AI ECG) to screen for ventricular dysfunction in patients with documented COVID-19. We examined all patients in the Mayo Clinic system who underwent clinically indicated electrocardiography and echocardiography within 2 weeks following a positive COVID-19 test and had permitted use of their data for research were included. Of the 27 patients who met the inclusion criteria, one had a history of normal ventricular function who developed COVID-19 myocarditis with rapid clinical decline. The initial AI ECG in this patient indicated normal ventricular function. Repeat AI ECG showed a probability of ejection fraction (EF) less than or equal to 40% of 90.2%, corroborated with an echocardiographic EF of 35%. One other patient had a pre-existing EF less than or equal to 40%, accurately detected by the algorithm before and after COVID-19 diagnosis, and another was found to have a low EF by AI ECG and echocardiography with the COVID-19 diagnosis. The area under the curve for detection of EF less than or equal to 40% was 0.95. This case series suggests that the AI ECG, previously shown to detect ventricular dysfunction in a large general population, may be useful as a screening tool for the detection of cardiac dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.","Attia, Zachi I; Kapa, Suraj; Noseworthy, Peter A; Lopez-Jimenez, Francisco; Friedman, Paul A",Mayo Clin Proc,,476

HSA can be find in two forms: reduced albumin (human mercaptalbumin (HMA)) and oxidized albumin (human non-mercaptalbumin (HNA)). The rate of oxidized albumin to total albumin can be enhanced in multiple diseases. Increase in HNA level have been demonstrated in liver, diabetes plus fatigue and coronary artery diseases. In liver patients, this enhancement can reach to 50-200 percent which can then lead to bacterial/viral infections and eventually death in severe conditions. Due to the induction of cytokine storm, we can say that the level of HNA in serum of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients may be a positive predictor of mortality, especially in patients with underlying diseases such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, aging and other inflammatory diseases. We suggest that checking oxidized albumin in COVID-19 patients may provide new therapeutic and diagnostic opportunities to better combat COVID-19.","Rahmani-Kukia, Nasim; Abbasi, Ardeshir; Pakravan, Nafiseh; Hassan, Zuhair Mohammad",Bioorg Chem,,476

DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: General paediatric department of a university hospital in Paris, France. PARTICIPANTS: 21 children and adolescents (aged &#8804;18 years) with features of Kawasaki disease who were admitted to hospital between 27 April and 11 May 2020 and followed up until discharge by 15 May 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes were clinical and biological data, imaging and echocardiographic findings, treatment, and outcomes. Nasopharyngeal swabs were prospectively tested for SARS-CoV-2 using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and blood samples were tested for IgG antibodies to the virus. RESULTS: 21 children and adolescents (median age 7.9 (range 3.7-16.6) years) were admitted with features of Kawasaki disease over a 15 day period, with 12 (57%) of African ancestry. 12 (57%) presented with Kawasaki disease shock syndrome and 16 (76%) with myocarditis. 17 (81%) required intensive care support. All 21 patients had noticeable gastrointestinal symptoms during the early stage of illness and high levels of inflammatory markers. 19 (90%) had evidence of recent SARS-CoV-2 infection (positive RT-PCR result in 8/21, positive IgG antibody detection in 19/21). All 21 patients received intravenous immunoglobulin and 10 (48%) also received corticosteroids. The clinical outcome was favourable in all patients.

Herein, vertically oriented graphene nanosheets (VGNs) are in situ fabricated on the surface of free-standing and flexible Si3 N4 nanowires (NWs) membrane by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), which are directly used as flexible nanoscale conductive substrates. NiCo2 O4 hollow nanospheres (HSs) and FeOOH amorphous nanorods (NRs) are finally prepared on Si3 N4NWs @VGNs, which are served as the positive and negative electrodes, respectively. Profiting from the structural merits, the synthesized Si3 N4NWs @VGNs@NiCo2 O4HSs and Si3 N4NWs @VGNs@FeOOHNRs membrane electrodes exhibit remarkable electrochemical performance. Using Si3 N4NWs membrane as the separator, the assembled all Si3 N4NWs membrane-based flexible solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) with a wide operating potential window of 1.8 V yields the outstanding energy density of 96.3 Wh kg-1 , excellent cycling performance (91.7% after 6000 cycles), and good mechanical flexibility. More importantly, this work provides a rational design strategy for the preparation of flexible electrode materials and broadens the applications of Si3 N4NWs in the field of energy storage.","Yin, Xuemin; Li, Hejun; Han, Liyuan; Meng, Jiachen; Lu, Jinhua; Song, Qiang",Small,,476

In the liver, there is a large body of evidence showing a protective and pro-regenerative role for IL6 cis and trans signaling. While a few studies suggest a pathological role for IL6 trans-signaling in the liver. IL11 is often thought of as similar to IL6 and redundancy has been inferred. However, recent studies reveal that IL6R and IL11RA are expressed on dissimilar cell types and these cytokines actually have very different roles in biology and pathology. In the liver, IL6R is mostly expressed on immune cells, whereas IL11RA is highly expressed on hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells, both of which exhibit autocrine IL11 activity. In contrast to the beneficial effects of IL6 in the liver, IL11 causes liver disease and its expression in stromal and parenchymal cells leads to fibrosis, inflammation, steatosis and hepatic failure. In this review, we address IL6 and IL11 in the context of liver function. We end by discussing the possibility of IL6 gain-of-function versus IL11 inhibition as therapeutic approaches to treat liver disease.","Widjaja, Anissa A; Chothani, Sonia P; Cook, Stuart A",Hum Vaccin Immunother,,476

A number of other cell entry mediators have also been identified, including neuropilin­1 (NRP1) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). More recently, it has been demonstrated that transmembrane protease serine 4 (TMPRSS4) along with TMPRSS2 activate the SARS­CoV­2 S proteins, and enhance the viral infection of human small intestinal enterocytes. To date, a systematic analysis of TMPRSS4 in health and disease is lacking. In the present study, using in silico tools, the gene expression and genetic alteration of TMPRSS4 were analysed across numerous tumours and compared to controls. The observations were also expanded to the level of the central nervous system (CNS). The findings revealed that TMPRSS4 was overexpressed in 11 types of cancer, including lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, cervical squamous cell carcinoma, thyroid carcinoma, ovarian cancer, cancer of the rectum, pancreatic cancer, colon and stomach adenocarcinoma, uterine carcinosarcoma and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma, whilst it was significantly downregulated in kidney carcinomas, acute myeloid leukaemia, skin cutaneous melanoma and testicular germ cell tumours. Finally, a high TMPRSS4 expression was documented in the olfactory tubercle, paraolfactory gyrus and frontal operculum, all brain regions which are associated with the sense of smell and taste. Collectively, these data suggest that TMPRSS4 may play a role in COVID­19 symptomatology as another SARS­CoV­2 host cell entry mediator responsible for the tropism of this coronavirus both in the periphery and the CNS.","Katopodis, Periklis; Kerslake, Rachel; Davies, Julie; Randeva, Harpal S; Chatha, Kamaljit; Hall, Marcia; Spandidos, Demetrios A; Anikin, Vladimir; Polychronis, Andreas; Robertus, Jan L; Kyrou, Ioannis; Karteris, Emmanouil",Int. j. mol. med,,476

Objective: The objective of the study was to study the effect of the reduced form of methylene blue (MB) on the improvement of oxygen saturation (SpO2) and respiratory rate (RR). Methods: In an academic medical center, 80 hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 were randomly assigned to receive either oral MB along with standard of care (SOC) (MB group, n = 40) or SOC only (SOC group, n=40). The primary outcomes were SpO2 and RR on the 3rd and 5th days. The secondary outcomes were hospital stay and mortality within 28 days. Results: In the MB group, a significant improvement in SpO2 and RR was observed on the 3rd day (for both, p < 0.0001) and also the 5th day (for both, p < 0.0001). In the SOC group, there was no significant improvement in SpO2 (p = 0.24) and RR (p = 0.20) on the 3rd day, although there was a significant improvement of SpO2 (p = 0.002) and RR (p = 0.01) on the 5th day. In the MB group in comparison to the SOC group, the rate ratio of increased SpO2 was 13.5 and 2.1 times on the 3rd and 5th days, respectively. In the MB group compared with the SOC group, the rate ratio of RR improvement was 10.1 and 3.7 times on the 3rd and 5th days, respectively. The hospital stay was significantly shortened in the MB group (p = 0.004), and the mortality was 12.5% and 22.5% in the MB and SOC groups, respectively. Conclusions: The addition of MB to the treatment protocols significantly improved SpO2 and respiratory distress in COVID-19 patients, which resulted in decreased hospital stay and mortality.

Most locally-acquired cases can be linked back to a confirmed case or known cluster, with a small portion unable to be epidemiologically linked to another case. The ratio of overseas-acquired cases to locally-acquired cases varies by jurisdiction. The crude case fatality rate (CFR) in Australia remains low (1.3%) compared to the World Health Organization's globally-reported rate (7.1%) and to other comparable high-income countries such as the United States of America (5.7%) and the United Kingdom (15.4%).

Here, we report that infectious virus shedding is detected by virus cultures in 23 of the 129 patients (17.8%) hospitalized with COVID-19. The median duration of shedding infectious virus is 8 days post onset of symptoms (IQR 5-11) and drops below 5% after 15.2 days post onset of symptoms (95% confidence interval (CI) 13.4-17.2). Multivariate analyses identify viral loads above 7 log10 RNA copies/mL (odds ratio [OR] of 14.7 (CI 3.57-58.1; p < 0.001) as independently associated with isolation of infectious SARS-CoV-2 from the respiratory tract. A serum neutralizing antibody titre of at least 1:20 (OR of 0.01 (CI 0.003-0.08; p < 0.001) is independently associated with non-infectious SARS-CoV-2.

331160,L’emergenza Covid-19: Possibili lezioni per gli studiosi di management,2020,"The hot component of the circum-galactic medium (CGM) around star forming galaxies is detected as diffuse X-ray emission. The X-ray spectra from the CGM depend on the temperature and metallicity of the emitting plasma, providing important information about the feeding and feedback of the galaxy. The observed spectra are commonly fitted using simple 1-Temperature (1-T) or 2-T models. However, the actual temperature distribution of the gas can be complex because of the interaction between galactic outflows and halo gas. Here we demonstrate this by analysing 3-D hydrodynamical simulations of the CGM with a realistic outflow model. We investigate the physical properties of the simulated hot CGM, which shows a broad distribution in density, temperature, and metallicity. By constructing and fitting the simulated spectra, we show that, while the 1-T and 2-T models are able to fit the synthesized spectra reasonably well, the inferred temperature(s) bear little physical meaning. Instead, we propose a log-normal distribution as a more physical model. The log-normal model better fits the simulated spectra while reproducing the gas temperature distribution. We also show that when the star formation rate is high, the spectra inside the bi-conical outflows are distinct from that outside, as outflows are generally hotter and more metal-enriched. Finally, we produce mock spectra for future missions with the eV-level spectral resolution, such as Athena, Lynx, and HUBS.","Vijayan, Aditi; Li, Miao",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.11510v1.pdf,476

To further understand the disease, we compared its clinical characteristics, symptoms, and outcomes by gender. In an analysis of public surveillance data of Taiwan from January 21 to April 18, 2020, a total of 398 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 by the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in pharynx swabs. We divided the patients into two groups: men and women. The associated data were collected, and multivariate comparisons of radiographic infiltration were conducted to analyze the gender-based differences. The mean incubation period was 5.4±5 days, and the incubation period in men was 3.2 days longer than that in women (8±8.1 vs. 4.8±3, p=0.05). The male patients with COVID-19 with infiltration in chest X-rays (CXR) were 12 years older than their female counterparts. The mortality rate in the male patients with COVID-19 was 6.4-fold higher than that in the female patients (3.2% vs. 0.5%, p<0.05). The patients with co-morbidities of diabetes mellitus and hypertension were vulnerable to infiltration in CXR, and the patients with COVID-19 who had infiltration in CXR easily ended up with intubation, intensive care unit admission, and mortality. Moreover, female patients with COVID-19 who had fever, cough, and dyspnea were susceptible to infiltration in CXR. Irrespective of whether the cases were imported female from Europe, America, or Asia, indigenous male, the factors associated with death in patients with severe COVID-19 were male sex, elderly, female with fever, cough, dyspnea and DM.","Su, Yu-Jang; Kuo, Kuan-Chih; Wang, Ta-Wei; Chang, Chen-Wang",New Microbes New Infect,,476

The focus has been given in this research keeping an administrative point of view in mind. In this paper a dynamic model of infected population due to spreading of pandemic COVID-19 considering both intra and inter zone mobilization factors with rate of detection has been proposed. Few factors related to intra zone mobilization; inter zone mobilization and rate of detection are the key points in the proposed model. Various remedial steps are taken into consideration in the form of operating procedures. Further such operating procedures are applied over the model in standalone or hybridized mode and responses are reported in this paper in a case-studies manner. Further zone-wise increase in infected population due to the spreading of pandemic COVID-19 has been studied and reported in this paper. Also the proposed model has been applied over the real world data considering three states of India and the predicted responses are compared with real data and reported with bar chart representation in this paper.","Ghosh, Mousam; Ghosh, Swarnankur; Ghosh, Suman; Panda, Goutam Kumar; Saha, Pradip Kumar",Chaos Solitons Fractals,,476

While current gold-standard techniques are highly sensitive and quantitative, they are slow and require expensive equipment. Conversely, current rapid field-deployable assays available provide essentially binary information about the presence of the target analyte, not a quantitative measure of concentration. Here, we report the development of a molecular diagnostic test [quantitative recombinase polymerase amplification (qRPA)] that utilizes competitive amplification during a recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assay to provide semi-quantitative information on a target nucleic acid. We demonstrate that qRPA can quantify DNA, RNA, and viral titers in HIV and COVID-19 patient samples and that it is more robust to environmental perturbations than traditional RPA. These features make qRPA potentially useful for at-home testing to monitor the progress of viral infections or other diseases.","Mancuso, Christopher P; Lu, Zhi-Xiang; Qian, Jason; Boswell, Sarah A; Springer, Michael",Anal Chem,,476

Asymptomatic carriers play a critical role in the nature of this virus, which is rapidly escalating into a global pandemic. Asymptomatic carriers can inadvertently transmit the virus through the air stream. Many diseases can infect human bodies with tiny droplets or particles that carry various viruses and bacteria that are generated by the respiratory system of infected patients. This article presents the numerical results of the spread of droplets or particles in a room. The proposed numerical model in this work takes into account the sedimentation of particles or droplets under the action of gravitational sedimentation and transport in the room during the process of breathing and sneezing or coughing. Three different cases are numerically investigated taking into account normal breathing and coughing or sneezing, respectively, and three different rates of particle ejection from the mouth are considered. Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible flows were used to describe three-dimensional air flow inside ventilated rooms. The influence of ventilation rate on social distancing is also computationally investigated. It was found that particles can move up to 5 m with a decrease in concentration in the direction of the air flow. The conclusions made in this work show that, given the environmental conditions, the two meter social distance recommended by WHO is insufficient.","Issakhov, Alibek; Zhandaulet, Yeldos; Omarova, Perizat; Alimbek, Aidana; Borsikbayeva, Aliya; Mustafayeva, Ardak",Sci Rep,,476

The understanding of the host immune response in COVID-19 and its implications in the development of therapeutic agents are new challenges. Here, we evaluated the development of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and neutralizing (Nt) antibodies in symptomatic hospitalized COVID-19 patients. We followed up 117 COVID-19 confirmed patients from a reference health center for COVID-19 during the epidemic in Santiago de Chile. One and two sequential blood samples from 117 to 68 cases were, respectively, obtained to evaluate the immune response. Immunofluorescence and neutralization assays in Vero E6 cells with a Chilean SARS-CoV-2 strain were performed. Out of the 68 patients, 44% were women and 56% men, and the most frequent comorbidities were hypertension (47.7%) and diabetes (27.4%). The most frequent symptoms or signs related to COVID-19 were dyspnea, cough, fever, myalgia, and headache. In all the study population, 76.1% and 60.7% of patients were positive for IgG and Nt antibodies in the first blood sample. All patients except one were positive for IgG and Nt antibodies in the second sample. IgG and Nt antibodies positivity increased significantly according to the disease evolution periods. Higher Nt antibody titers were observed in the first sample in patients under 60 years of age. Obese and diabetic patients had no increase in Nt antibodies, unlike normal weight and diabetes-free patients. Both hypertensive and normotensive patients showed a significant increase in Nt antibodies. These results show an early and robust immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection during severe COVID-19.","Teresa Valenzuela, María; Urquidi, Cinthya; Rodriguez, Nicolás; Castillo, Luis; Fernández, Jorge; Ramírez, Eugenio",J Med Virol,,476

333478,Women at the frontline of COVID-19: Can Gender Mainstreaming in Free Trade Agreements Help?,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of the mental health of pregnant women during the early and peak stages of the Covid-19 outbreak DESIGN: Online survey PARTICIPANTS: Pregnant women over the age of 18 years with no mental disorder during the pre-pregnancy period (N = 729). MEASUREMENTS AND FINDINGS: Mental disorders were assessed using the ""Depression Anxiety Stress Scale"" and social support was determined using the ""Multidimensional Perceived Social Support Scale."" Pregnant women had moderate levels of anxiety and depression and mild levels of stress. Anxiety, depression, and stress of moderate or high severity was reported in 62.2%, 44.6%, and 32.2% of the women, respectively. Pregnant women who lost their jobs during the pandemic period showed a 3-fold increase in the risk of anxiety, a 6-fold increase in the risk of depression, and a 4.8-fold increase in the risk of stress. An increase in the perception of social support has protective effects against all three mental disorders during pregnancy. In pregnant women with at least one obstetric risk, the risk of antenatal anxiety is 2 times higher than that in women with no risk. Similarly, women with a chronic physical illness before pregnancy have a higher risk of anxiety during pregnancy than healthy women. Financial strain has predictive value for anxiety and depression, and advanced age is a predictor for depression. KEY CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of mental disorders in pregnant women during the pandemic period was much higher than that during the pre-pandemic period. The high frequency of antenatal mental disorders can lead to an increase in the frequency of obstetric and maternal complications in the short and long term. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Early detection of inadequate social support and economic difficulties of pregnant women during the pandemic period is recommended for protecting their mental health. Pregnant women should have easy access to psychosocial support, and they should be provided obstetric counseling during the pandemic conditions.","Koyucu, Refika Genç; Karaca, Pelin Palas",Midwifery,,476

To monitor and address the health needs of pilgrims in field clinics near the pilgrimage route, a syndromic surveillance system was designed and implemented by Global Health Development/Eastern Mediterranean Public Health Network in collaboration with Iraq Ministry of Health. This study aimed to analyze the effectiveness of the surveillance system and the data it gathered in evaluating the burden of common acute and infectious conditions, chronic conditions, and trauma and injuries during the Arba'een pilgrimage in 2018. Data were collected at 152 field clinics located across 11 governorates in Iraq at strategic points along the Arba'een pilgrimage route from all governorates to Karbala between October 8 and November 3, 2018. A team of 24 surveillance supervisors trained, oversaw, and provided technical support for 304 data collectors. The data collectors recorded data from 338,399 patients (42.5% female and 57.5% male) in the span of 26 days. The vast majority of patients were from Iraq (n = 294,260, 87.6%) and Iran (n = 34,691, 10.3%).

The goal is to identify nucleotide analogues that not only terminate RNA synthesis catalyzed by these coronavirus RdRps, but also have the potential to resist the viruses' exonuclease activity. We examined these nucleotide analogues for their ability to be incorporated by the RdRps in the polymerase reaction and to prevent further incorporation. While all 11 molecules tested displayed incorporation, 6 exhibited immediate termination of the polymerase reaction (triphosphates of Carbovir, Ganciclovir, Stavudine and Entecavir; 3'-OMe-UTP and Biotin-16-dUTP), 2 showed delayed termination (Cidofovir diphosphate and 2'-OMe-UTP), and 3 did not terminate the polymerase reaction (2'-F-dUTP, 2'-NH2-dUTP and Desthiobiotin-16-UTP). The coronaviruses possess an exonuclease that apparently requires a 2'-OH at the 3'-terminus of the growing RNA strand for proofreading. In this study, all nucleoside triphosphate analogues evaluated form Watson-Crick-like base pairs. The nucleotide analogues demonstrating termination either lack a 2'-OH, have a blocked 2'-OH, or show delayed termination. Thus, these nucleotide analogues are of interest for further investigation to evaluate whether they can evade the viral exonuclease activity. Prodrugs of five of these nucleotide analogues (Cidofovir, Abacavir, Valganciclovir/Ganciclovir, Stavudine and Entecavir) are FDA-approved medications for treatment of other viral infections, and their safety profiles are well established. After demonstrating potency in inhibiting viral replication in cell culture, candidate molecules can be rapidly evaluated as potential therapies for COVID-19.","Jockusch, Steffen; Tao, Chuanjuan; Li, Xiaoxu; Anderson, Thomas K; Chien, Minchen; Kumar, Shiv; Russo, James J; Kirchdoerfer, Robert N; Ju, Jingyue",Antiviral Res,,476

However, the specific post-traumatic implication of this crisis has not been adequately studied yet. The current study was aimed to ascertain the most central symptom and the strong connections between symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). At the same time, exploring the relationship between covariates and the network of PTSD symptoms, by taking sex, anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation, quality of life, and social support as covariates, may help us to know the arise and maintenance of PTSD symptoms and give specified suggestions to people under the shadow of COVID-19. Method: The Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), was used to assess the PTSD symptoms extent of 338 healthy participants over the past month. Networks were analyzed using state-of-the-art regularized partial correlation models. In addition, the centrality of the symptoms and the robustness of the results were analyzed. Results: The network analysis revealed that the especially strong connections emerged between avoidance of thoughts and avoidance of reminders, hypervigilance and exaggerated startle response, intrusive thoughts and nightmares, flashbacks and emotional cue reactivity, and detachment and restricted affect. The most central symptoms were self-destructive/reckless behavior. Incorporation of covariates into the network revealed the strong connections path between self-destructive/reckless behavior and loss of interest and depression. Conclusion: Self-destructive/reckless behavior was the most central symptom in the network of PTSD symptoms related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which as an important target of interfere may have great benefits.","Jiang, Wanyue; Ren, Zhihong; Yu, Lixia; Tan, Yafei; Shi, Congrong",Front Psychiatry,,476

336299,An update on travel and COVID-19: what the practice nurse needs to know,2021,"COVID-19 potentially threatens the lives and livelihood of people all over the world. The disease is presently a major health concern in Ghana and the rest of the world. Although, human to human transmission dynamics has been established, not much research is done on the dynamics of the virus in the environment and the role human play by releasing the virus into the environment. Therefore, investigating the human-environment-human by use of mathematical analysis and optimal control theory is relatively necessary. The dynamics of COVID-19 for this study is segregated into compartments as: Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Asymptomatic (A), Symptomatic (I), Recovered (R) and the Virus in the environment/surfaces (V). The basic reproduction number R 0without controls is computed. The application of Lyapunov's function is used to analyse the global stability of the proposed model. We fit the model to real data from Ghana in the time window 12th March 2020 to 7th May 2020, with the aid of python programming language using the least-squares method. The average basic reproduction number without controls, R 0 a, is approximately 2.68. An optimal control is formulated based on the sensitivity analysis. Numerical simulation of the model is also done to verify the analytic results. The admissible control set such as: effective testing and quarantine when boarders are opened, the usage of masks and face shields through media education, cleaning of surfaces with home-based detergents, practising proper cough etiquette and fumigating commercial areas; health centers is simulated in MATLAB. We used forward-backward sweep Runge-Kutta scheme which gave interesting results in the main text, for example, the cost-effectiveness analysis shows that, Strategy 4 (safety measures adopted by the asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals such as practicing proper coughing etiquette by maintaining a distance, covering coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing and washing of hands after coughing or sneezing) is the most cost-effective strategy among all the six control intervention strategies under consideration.","Asamoah, Joshua Kiddy K.; Owusu, Mark A.; Jin, Zhen; Oduro, F.

336493,A Critical Assessment of Some Recent Work on COVID-19,2020-05-20,"We examine how the contemporary art market has changed as a result of the disruptions caused by the novel coronavirus. Based on interviews with artists, collectors, a dealer, and an auction house executive, we argue that the decline of face-to-face interaction, previously essential to art market transactions, has placed strain on each corner of the community. In the absence of physical co-presence with the artworks and art world actors, participants struggle to evaluate and appreciate artworks, make new social ties, develop trust, and experience a shared sense of pleasure and collective effervescence. These challenges especially impact the primary gallery market, where participants emphasize a communal commitment to art above instrumental speculation, which is more accepted in the secondary auction market. We find a transition to distant online communication, but the likelihood of this continuing after the lockdowns end and the virus dissipates varies according to the subcultures of these market segments.","Buchholz, Larissa; Fine, Gary Alan; Wohl, Hannah",Am J Cult Sociol,,476

The counts of total T cells and T-cell subsets, especially CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, are decreased in patients with COVID-19. Also, the function of these cells becomes less effective as the expression of immune inhibitory receptors, such as Tim3 and PD-1, increases over time during the disease. Kinetic analyses show that the T-cell profile changes dynamically, so does the COVID-19 stages. As COVID-19 continues to deteriorate and progresses to severe/critical condition, the lymphocyte count steadily decreases. Therefore, the ability of COVID-19 to escape the immune system might lie in its power to profoundly diminish T-cell effective function, which is necessary for the establishment of a robust antiviral immunity. Also, COVID-19 is associated with increased numbers of monocytes and macrophages, and as the disease progresses from a mild form to a severe/critical condition, the macrophage population becomes denser. Monitoring the expression of cytokines associated with macrophage activation, mainly interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10, indicates that the course of COVID-19 consists of two stages and the transition between disease stages occurs by the end of the first week after onset of symptoms. At the initial stage, the immune military recognizes the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as nonself and thus fires macrophages at the lungs against the virus. The first flame can control disease progression effectively. However, a trained immunocompetent system would maintain the fire of macrophages over an extended time. It lies in its immune memory in tissue-resident macrophages, especially alveolar macrophages, making a professionally trained immune system more likely to be feared by COVID-19 than an untrained immune system. In this manner, the trained immunocompetent system commits such a failure that causes the lungs to come down rapidly. The fact that younger age groups, including neonates and children, are less susceptible to COVID-19 than older age groups reflects that the natural affinities of the immune system that has not been trained thoroughly would be standard in combatting against COVID-19 whereas the higher affinities of the trained immune system for rapid activation of immune responses might raise faults - the lungs come down.","Saghazadeh, Amene; Rezaei, Nima",Adv Exp Med Biol,,476

An understanding of the pathogenesis and the development of treatment strategies is of high interest. Recently, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have been identified as a potential driver of severe SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans. NETs are extracellular DNA fibers released by neutrophils after contact with various stimuli and accumulate antimicrobial substances or host defense peptides. When massively released, NETs are described to contribute to immunothrombosis in acute respiratory distress syndrome and in vascular occlusions. Based on the increasing evidence that NETs contribute to severe COVID-19 cases, DNase treatment of COVID-19 patients to degrade NETs is widely discussed as a potential therapeutic strategy. Here, we discuss potential detrimental effects of NETs and their nuclease degradation, since NET fragments can boost certain bacterial coinfections and thereby increase the severity of the disease.","de Buhr, Nicole; von Köckritz-Blickwede, Maren",mBio (Online),,476

Changes in haematological characteristics in patients with COVID-19 are emerging as important features of the disease. We aimed to explore the haematological characteristics and related risk factors in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included patients with COVID-19 admitted to three designated sites of Wuhan Union Hospital (Wuhan, China). Demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between patients with moderate, severe, and critical disease (defined according to the diagnosis and treatment protocol for novel coronavirus pneumonia, trial version 7, published by the National Health Commission of China). We assessed the risk factors associated with critical illness and poor prognosis. Dynamic haematological and coagulation parameters were investigated with a linear mixed model, and coagulopathy screening with sepsis-induced coagulopathy and International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis overt disseminated intravascular coagulation scoring systems was applied. FINDINGS: Of 466 patients admitted to hospital from Jan 23 to Feb 23, 2020, 380 patients with COVID-19 were included in our study. The incidence of thrombocytopenia (platelet count <100â×â109 cells per L) in patients with critical disease (42 [49%] of 86) was significantly higher than in those with severe (20 [14%] of 145) or moderate (nine [6%] of 149) disease (p<0·0001). The numbers of lymphocytes and eosinophils were significantly lower in patients with critical disease than those with severe or moderate disease (p<0·0001), and prothrombin time, D-dimer, and fibrin degradation products significantly increased with increasing disease severity (p<0·0001). In multivariate analyses, death was associated with increased neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (&#8805;9·13; odds ratio [OR] 5·39 [95% CI 1·70-17·13], p=0·0042), thrombocytopenia (platelet count <100â×â109 per L; OR 8·33 [2·56-27·15], p=0·00045), prolonged prothrombin time (>16 s; OR 4·94 [1·50-16·25], p=0·0094), and increased D-dimer (>2 mg/L; OR 4·41 [1·06-18·30], p=0·041). Thrombotic and haemorrhagic events were common complications in patients who died (19 [35%] of 55). Sepsis-induced coagulopathy and International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis overt disseminated intravascular coagulation scores (assessed in 12 patients who survived and eight patients who died) increased over time in patients who died. The onset of sepsis-induced coagulopathy was typically before overt disseminated intravascular coagulation. INTERPRETATION: Rapid blood tests, including platelet count, prothrombin time, D-dimer, and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio can help clinicians to assess severity and prognosis of patients with COVID-19. The sepsis-induced coagulopathy scoring system can be used for early assessment and management of patients with critical disease.

Many respiratory viruses bind to glycans on the heavily glycosylated mucins that give mucus its gel-like characteristics. Influenza viruses, some paramyxoviruses, and coronaviruses avoid becoming trapped in the mucus by releasing themselves by means of their envelope-embedded enzymes that destroy glycan receptors. For efficient infection, receptor binding and destruction need to be in balance with the host receptor repertoire. Establishment in a novel host species requires resetting of the balance to adapt to the different glycan repertoire encountered. Growing understanding of species-specific mucosal glycosylation patterns and the dynamic interaction with respiratory viruses identifies the mucus layer as a major host-range determinant and barrier for zoonotic transfer.","Wallace, Louisa E; Liu, Mengying; van Kuppeveld, Frank J M; de Vries, Erik; de Haan, Cornelis A M",Trends microbiol,,476

This paper aims to provide insight into shifts in alcohol consumption and associated factors during the epidemic. DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross-sectional convenience sample of 2307 Australians aged 18 and over who drank at least monthly was recruited through social media. Respondents were asked about their alcohol consumption and purchasing in 2019 prior to the epidemic plus similar questions about their experiences in the month prior to being surveyed between 29 April and 16 May 2020. RESULTS: Reports of average consumption before (3.53 drinks per day [3.36, 3.71 95% confidence interval]) and during (3.52 [3.34, 3.69]) the pandemic were stable. However, young men and those who drank more outside the home in 2019 reported decreased consumption during the pandemic, and people with high levels of stress and those who bulk-bought alcohol when restrictions were announced reported an increase in consumption relative to those who did not. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: A reported increase in consumption among those experiencing more stress suggests that some people may have been drinking to cope during the epidemic. Conversely, the reported decrease in consumption among those who drank more outside of their home in 2019 suggests that closing all on-trade sales did not result in complete substitution of on-premise drinking with home drinking in this group. Monitoring of relevant subgroups to assess long-term changes in consumption in the aftermath of the epidemic is recommended.","Callinan, Sarah; Mojica-Perez, Yvette; Wright, Cassandra J C; Livingston, Michael; Kuntsche, Sandra; Laslett, Anne-Marie; Room, Robin; Kuntsche, Emmanuel",Drug alcohol rev,,476

338525,Impact of containment type on covid-19 propagation in morocco using the sir model,2020,"Background and objective The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) primarily affects the lungs. However, others organs are also affected in varying degrees. We aimed to investigate the changes in pancreatic density on CT and its correlation with amylase/lipase values in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Materials and methods Radiological changes using non-contrast CT and amylase/lipase values were evaluated retrospectively in patients admitted to the pandemic clinic. The patients were classified into two groups: [polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive and PCR-negative]. The correlation and difference between the data were evaluated statistically. Results There was no significant difference with respect to age and gender between the two groups (PCR-positive and PCR-negative). There was a significant difference in the head, neck, trunk, and tail of the pancreas and mean density values, but no statistically significant difference in amylase and lipase values between the two groups. No significant correlation was found using Spearman's correlation test. Conclusion Based on our findings, pancreatic involvement and severe necrotizing pancreatitis can be seen in COVID-19 patients. Pancreatic involvement is more common in patients with severe disease. Patients with gastrointestinal complaints should be evaluated for pancreatitis and their amylase/lipase values should be assessed. We believe that decreased pancreatic density on CT scans can be an early sign of pancreatitis.","Bozdag, A.; Eroglu, Y.; Tartar, A. S.; Bozdag, P. G.; Aglamis, S.",Cureus,,476
338563,Using diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences to identify causal eﬀects of COVID-19 policies,2020,"Major pandemics have tremendous effects on society. They precipitated the early decline of the Western Roman Empire and helped spread Christianity. There are countless such examples of infectious diseases altering the course of history. The impact of epidemics on education however is less well documented. This present historical account of the past 800 years looks specifically at how some aspects of education were shaped from the early medieval epidemics such as leprosy and the Black Plague to the Spanish Flu and COVID-19. Leprosy changed religious education, and the Black Plague may have contributed to the rise of medical schools, hospitals, public health education, and led to the implementation of lazarettos and the quarantine. The smallpox epidemic helped usher in public health education for immunization, while the 1918 Spanish Flu precipitated the rise of education by correspondence, and recently COVID-19 has catapulted remote digital learning to the forefront of higher education.","Spielman, Andrew I; Sunavala-Dossabhoy, Gulshan",J Dent Educ,,476
338605,Lessons learned from the fight against COVID-19 in the great maghreb. Five lessons for a better response,2020,"Geographic inequalities in COVID-19 diagnosis are now well documented. However, we do not sufficiently know whether inequalities are related to social characteristics of communities, such as collective engagement. We tested whether neighborhood social cohesion is associated with inequalities in COVID-19 diagnosis rate and the extent the association varies across neighborhood racial composition. We calculated COVID-19 diagnosis rates in Philadelphia, PA, per 10,000 general population across 46 ZIP codes, as of April 2020. Social cohesion measures were from the Southeastern Pennsylvania Household Health Survey, 2018. We estimated Poisson regressions to quantify associations between social cohesion and COVID-19 diagnosis rate, testing a multiplicative interaction with Black racial composition in the neighborhood, which we operationalize via a binary indicator of ZIP codes above vs. below the city-wide average (41%) Black population. Two social cohesion indicators were significantly associated with COVID-19 diagnosis. Associations varied across Black neighborhood racial composition (p <0.05 for the interaction test). In ZIP codes with &#8805;41% of Black people, higher collective engagement was associated with an 18% higher COVID-19 diagnosis rate (IRR=1.18, 95%CI=1.11, 1.26). In contrast, areas with <41% of Black people, higher engagement was associated with a 26% lower diagnosis rate (IRR=0.74, 95%CI=0.67, 0.82). Neighborhood social cohesion is associated with both higher and lower COVID-19 diagnosis rates, and the extent of associations varies across Black neighborhood racial composition. We recommend some strategies for reducing inequalities based on the segmentation model within the social cohesion and public health intervention framework.","Ransome, Yusuf; Ojikutu, Bisola O; Buchanan, Morgan; Johnston, Demerise; Kawachi, Ichiro",J Urban Health,,476
338726,Can pandemics transform scientific novelty? Evidence from COVID-19,2020-09-26,"There are several ways for transmitting the SARS-CoV-2 virus to humans, and one of these ways is the contact with infected surfaces. Fuel stations have been a major concern for people and health experts due to the frequent use of common nozzles. This study was performed to identify the COVID-19 virus in the nozzles of fuel supply stations. In the current research, 25 fuel supply stations along the main street ways were investigated to recognize Coronavirus infection on the surfaces of the nozzles. For each fuel supply station, 4 nozzles were chosen (a total of 100 samples). The sampling was carried out at two periods of time, that is, before and after quarantine restrictions. Swapping was used for surface sampling, and Real-time PCR was used to determine the positive and negative results. The results showed that out of nine fuel supply stations (36 samples of nozzle surfaces), five were positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 on the nozzle surfaces before the corona restriction. The results showed that in the conditions after corona restriction, all samples were negative in terms of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 on the surfaces of the nozzles. In spite of the fact that gas stations can be one of the foremost inclined places for the transmission and spread of coronavirus due to the nearness and visit of individuals, but through the observance of health behaviors and implementing some procedures, cutting the transmission chain in gas stations can be facilitated.","Karami, Chiman; Normohammadi, Ali; Dargahi, Abdollah; Vosoughi, Mehdi; Zandian, Hamed; Jeddi, Farhad; Mokhtari, S Ahamad; Moradi-Asl, Eslam",Sci Total Environ,,476
338792,Mewujudkan Masyarakat Siaga COVID-19 Di Kelurahan Mintaragen Kecamatan Tegal Timur Kota Tegal Melalui Kegiatan KKN Tematik,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Recent studies have reported a high prevalence of thrombotic events in coronavirus disease 2019. However, the significance of thromboembolic complications has not been widely appreciated. The purpose of this review is to provide current knowledge of this serious problem. DESIGN: Narrative review. DATA SOURCES: Online search of published medical literature through PubMed using the term ""COVID-19,"" ""SARS,"" ""acute respiratory distress syndrome,"" ""coronavirus,"" ""coagulopathy,"" ""thrombus,"" and ""anticoagulants."" STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Articles were chosen for inclusion based on their relevance to coagulopathy and thrombosis in coronavirus disease 2019, and anticoagulant therapy. Reference lists were reviewed to identify additional relevant articles. DATA SYNTHESIS: Coronavirus disease 2019 is associated with a strikingly high prevalence of coagulopathy and venous thromboembolism that may contribute to respiratory deterioration. Monitoring coagulation variables is important, as abnormal coagulation tests are related to adverse outcomes and may necessitate adjuvant antithrombotic interventions. In the initial phase of the infection, D-dimer and fibrinogen levels are increased, while activated partial prothrombin time, prothrombin time, and platelet counts are often relatively normal. Increased D-dimer levels three times the upper limit of normal may trigger screening for venous thromboembolism. In all hospitalized patients, thromboprophylaxis using low-molecular-weight heparin is currently recommended. The etiology of the procoagulant responses is complex and thought to be a result of specific interactions between host defense mechanisms and the coagulation system. Although the coagulopathy is reminiscent of disseminated intravascular coagulation and thrombotic microangiopathy, it has features that are markedly distinct from these entities. CONCLUSIONS: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2/coronavirus disease 2019 frequently induces hypercoagulability with both microangiopathy and local thrombus formation, and a systemic coagulation defect that leads to large vessel thrombosis and major thromboembolic complications, including pulmonary embolism in critically ill hospitalized patients. D-dimers and fibrinogen levels should be monitored, and all hospitalized patients should undergo thromboembolism prophylaxis with an increase in therapeutic anticoagulation in certain clinical situations.","Iba, Toshiaki; Levy, Jerrold H; Levi, Marcel; Connors, Jean Marie; Thachil, Jecko",Crit Care Med,,476

Here, we report the synthesis of a novel messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) encoding the spike protein in a lipid nanoparticle formulation (LNP) (STI-7264) that generates robust humoral and cellular immunity following immunization of C57Bl6 mice. In efforts to continually improve immunity, a lymphatic drug delivery device (MuVaxx) was engineered and tested to modulate immune cells at the injection site (epidermis and dermis) and draining lymph node (LN) to elicit adaptive immunity. Using MuVaxx, immune responses were elicited and maintained at a 10-fold dose reduction compared to traditional intramuscular (IM) administration as measured by anti-spike antibodies, cytokine producing CD8 T cells, and neutralizing antibodies against the Washington (Wild Type, WT) and South African (beta) variants. Remarkably, a 4-fold elevated T cell response was observed in MuVaxx administered vaccination as compared to that of IM administered vaccination. Thus, these data support further investigation into STI-7264 and lymphatic mediated delivery using MuVaxx for SARS-CoV-2 and VoCs vaccines.","Francis, David M; Chen, Runqiang; Khorsandzadeh, Sahba; Hu, Qidong; Lyu, Xiaoxuan; Wang, Hua; Lim, Wan-lin; Sun, Haotian; Xie, Hui; Shaabani, Namir; Ross, Russell; Cooley, Brian; Ji, Henry",,,476

339526,The impact of time to impose lockdown on COVID-19 cases and deaths in European countries,2020,"BACKGROUND: Tracheostomy, as an aerosol-generating procedure, is considered as a high-risk surgery for health care workers (HCWs) during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Current recommendations are to perform tracheostomy after a period of intubation of > 14 days, with two consecutive negative throat swab tests, to lower the risk of contamination to HCWs. However, specific data for this recommendation are lacking. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate viral shedding into the environment, including HCWs, associated with bedside tracheostomy in the intensive care unit. METHODS: Samples obtained from the medical environment immediately after tracheostomy, including those from 19 surfaces, two air samples at 10 and 50 cm from the surgical site, and from the personal protective equipment (PPE) of the surgeon and assistant, were tested for the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in eight cases of bedside tracheostomy. We evaluated the rate of positive tests from the different samples obtained. RESULTS: Positive samples were identified in only one of the eight cases. These were obtained for the air sample at 10 cm and from the bed handrail and urine bag. There were no positive test results from the PPE samples. The patient with positive samples had undergone early tracheostomy, at 9 days after intubation, due to a comorbidity. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results indicate that delayed tracheostomy, after an extended period of endotracheal intubation, might be a considerably less contagious procedure than early tracheostomy (defined as < 14 days after intubation).","Xu, Kai; Zhang, Xin-Hao; Long, Xiao-Bo; Lu, Xiang; Liu, Zheng",J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,,476

Favipiravir is a repurposed antiviral agent in treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to meet the current need, pharmaceutical companies are working for manufacturing licensed generic favipiravir. For getting the marketing authorization, the bioequivalence of the generic product must be proven first. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the bioequivalence of a new favipiravir tablet formulation as compared to the reference tablet formulation in healthy male subjects under fasting conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To prove the bioequivalence, a randomized, single oral dose, cross-over, two-period study was carried out in 30 healthy subjects under fasting conditions. Plasma favipiravir levels were quantified by using an in-house-developed high performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry detector (LC-MSD) method. RESULTS: The 90% CIs for the test/reference geometric mean ratios of the Cmax and AUC0-tlast were 88.02 - 103.11% and 98.19 - 102.06%, respectively.

339872,Prone Team: A Large-Scale Prone Position Initiative During COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"ABSTRACT: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread across China and many countries worldwide, and community healthcare workers at the front lines of disease control are under high physical and mental pressure. This study investigated the mental health status of community healthcare workers during the COVID-19 outbreak in Sichuan Province, China. This cross-sectional study, which was conducted from February 8 to 18, 2020, involved 450 healthcare workers in 18 community hospitals who had worked for more than 1 year. A self-designed demographic data questionnaire and Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90) were provided to the participants through links and quick response codes. The respondents completed and submitted the questionnaires online. Binary logistic regression was used to analyze multiple factors related to the SCL-90 scores of these community healthcare workers in China. For the 450 community healthcare workers who completed the study, the median scores in each SCL-90 factor were lower than the Chinese norms, and 119 (26.4%) participants were SCL-90 positive. Among them, 178 participants were doctors and had the highest scores on most SCL-90 factors except for obsessive compulsiveness, hostility, phobic anxiety, and psychoticism (Pâ<â0.05). The top 3 positive items for doctors working in the community were obsessive compulsiveness, others, and somatization, and those among nurses were obsessive compulsiveness, others, and hostility. Sex, type of workers, and occupational exposure risk to COVID-19 were independent risk factors for the mental health status of the community healthcare workers. Overall, the community healthcare workers experienced psychological problems during the COVID-19 outbreak in Sichuan Province, China. More attention should be paid to the mental health of these workers, and their mental status should be regularly assessed. Psychological interventions should be provided to those with serious mental problems through networks or telephone visits.","Zhang, Jianshu; Deng, Xuexue; Liu, Hong; Xu, Xiaoru; Fang, Ronghua",Medicine (Baltimore),,476

Our goal was to identify the incidence of AKI, predictive factors and impact on hospital mortality. METHOD: Retrospective cohort of patients with Covid-19 admitted to the ICU. AKI was defined according to KDIGO criteria. Data was collected from electronic medical records between March 17 and April 26. RESULTS: Of the 102 patients, 55.9% progressed with AKI, and the majority (66.7%) was classified as stage 3. Multivariate logistic regression showed age (RC 1.101; 95% CI 1.026 - 1.181; p = 0.0070), estimated glomerular filtration rate - eGFR (RC 1.127; 95% CI 1.022 - 1.243; p = 0.0170) and hypertension (RC 3.212; 95% CI 1.065 - 9.690; p = 0.0380) as independent predictors of AKI. Twenty-three patients died. In the group without kidney injury, there were 8.9% deaths, while in the group with AKI, 33.3% of patients died (RR 5.125; 95% CI 1.598 - 16.431; p = 0.0060). The average survival, in days, was higher in the group without AKI.

METHODS: PubMed and EMBASE were searched for all studies published over a 20-year time frame, prior to March 25, 2020. Original articles that reported predictors of failed enema reduction were included. The pooled odds ratio (OR) for successful enema reduction according to various features was calculated. The combined estimates were meta-analytically pooled by random-effects modeling. The risk of bias was assessed using the National Institute of Health Quality Assessment Tool. This review was registered to the PROSPERO (CRD42020190178). RESULTS: A total of 38 studies, comprising 40,133 cases, were included. The shorter duration of symptoms (< 24 h; combined OR, 3.812; 95% CI, 2.150-6.759) and abdominal pain (combined OR, 2.098; 95% CI, 1.405-3.133) were associated with the success (all p < 0.001). Age < 1 year (combined OR, 0.385; 95% CI, 0.166-0.893; p = 0.026), fever (combined OR, 0.519; 95% CI, 0.371-0.725; p < 0.001), rectal bleeding (combined OR, 0.252; 95% CI, 0.165-0.387; p < 0.001), and vomiting (combined OR, 0.497; 95% CI, 0.372-0.664; p < 0.001) were associated with the failed reduction. The ascites (combined OR, 0.127; 95% CI, 0.044-0.368; p = 0.001), left-sided intussusception (combined OR, 0.121; 95% CI, 0.058-0.252; p < 0.001), and trapped fluid (combined OR, 0.179; 95% CI, 0.061-0.525; p = 0.017) on US were associated with the failed reduction.

341433,Mechanical Risks of Ventilator Sharing in the COVID-19 Era: A Simulation-Based Study,2020,"Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in the Houston city area in the first week of March 2020. Soon hospitals in the city were overrun with COVID-19 patients. By October, COVID-19 had resulted in 216,025 deaths in the US1. Older patients and Hispanic, American Indian/Alaskan Natives, Black, and Asian patients have experienced the highest excessive deaths1. The aim of our research was to study the factors associated with mortality among COVID-19 patients. Methods: The study was conducted on patients at a large university-affiliated multi-hospital system. The study used data from electronic medical records with an inpatient admission from March-October 2020 and a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. The data included demographic information, prescreening information, length of stay, discharge disposition, diagnoses and comorbidity, respiratory support, medications, and laboratory test results. The dependent variable in all analyses was defined as a discharge disposition of in-hospital death or hospice. Unadjusted logistic regression analyses were carried out on all variables, and a multivariable logistic regression model was built using variables that lowered the Akaike information criterion. Laboratory values missing at random were imputed by multiple imputations using chained equations. Results: There were 8,341 inpatients admissions, of whom 1,139 died or received hospice. The median age was 72 years among dead/hospice patients and 55 years among patients discharged alive (p&lt;0.01). Death/hospice was higher among men (15% of all men vs. 12% of all women) and people who were Asian (20%), White (15%), and African American (12%). 10% of Hispanics and 13% of Non-Hispanic died or received hospice. The multivariable logistic regression model showed that receiving mechanical ventilation (OR 19.171), Non-invasive ventilation, using non-rebreather masks, high flow nasal cannula, ICU admission had higher odds of death/hospice. Increase in age, Charlson comorbidity index of 2 &3, and receiving convalescent plasma also had higher odds of death/hospice. Not receiving supplemental oxygen and increase in the anticoagulants administration days reduced the likelihood of death/hospice. Among laboratory values, an increase in the initial lactic acid, blood urea nitrogen, total bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase were associated with higher death/hospice odds. Conclusion: COVID-19 mortality has decreased over time due to a better understanding of managing the patients. This study highlights the most important predictors of mortality, which must be followed up by future studies. (Table Presented).","Karanth, S.; Gopal, K.; Akkanti, B.; Mathew, R.; Doshi, P.

341771,Specific COVID-19 messaging targeting ethnic minority communities,2021,"Modeling accurately the evolution and intervention strategies for the Covid-19 pandemic, that has now affected almost every country in the world, is a challenging problem. We present here an analysis of an extended Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model, that takes into account the presence of aymptomatic carriers, and explore the effects of different intervention strategies such as social distancing (SD) and testing-quarantining (TQ). The two intervention strategies (SD and TQ) try to reduce the disease reproductive number ($R_0>1$) to a target value ($R_0^{\rm target}<1 $), but in distinct ways, which we implement in our model equations. We find that for the same target value, $R_0^{\rm target}<1 $, TQ is more efficient in controlling the pandemic than lockdowns that only implement SD. However, for TQ to be effective, it has has to be based on contact tracing and the ratio of tests/per day to the number of new cases/per day has to be scaled with the mean number of contacts that an infectious person has, which would be high in regions with high population density and low levels of social distancing. We point out that, apart from $R_0$, an important quantity is the largest eigenvalue of the linearized dynamics which provides a more complete understanding of the disease progression both pre- and post- intervention and explains observed data. Weak extended intervention strategies (that reduce $R_0$ but not to a value less than $1$) can reduce the peak values of infections and the asymptotic affected population. We provide simple expressions for these in terms of the disease parameters and apply them in the Indian context to obtain heuristic projections for the course of the pandemic. Looking at real data, we find that for many countries, several broad qualitative features are captured well by the model.","Das, Arghya; Dhar, Abhishek; Goyal, Srashti; Kundu, Anupam",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11511v1.pdf,476

342993,Clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with hepatitis B virus infection - a retrospective study,2020,"BACKGROUND: Infection and inflammation induce epigenetic changes that alter gene expression. In periodontal disease, inflammation and microbial dysbiosis occur, which can lead to compromised barrier function of the gingival epithelia. Here, we tested the hypotheses that infection of cultured human gingival epithelial cells with Porphyromonas gingivalis disrupts barrier function by inducing epigenetic alterations and that these effects can be blocked by inhibitors of DNA methylation. METHODS: Primary human gingival epithelial (HGEp) cells were infected with P. gingivalis either in the presence or absence of the non-nucleoside DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors RG108, (-) epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), or curcumin. Barrier function was assessed as transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). DNA methylation and mRNA abundance were quantified for genes encoding components of three cell-cell junction complexes, CDH1, PKP2, and TJP1. Cell morphology and the abundance of cell-cell junction proteins were evaluated by confocal microscopy. RESULTS: Compared to non-infected cells, P. gingivalis infection decreased TEER (P < 0.0001) of HGEp cells; increased methylation of the CDH1, PKP2, and TJP1 (P < 0.0001); and reduced their expression (mRNA abundance) (P < 0.005). Pretreatment with DNMT inhibitors prevented these infection-induced changes in HGEp cells, as well as the altered morphology associated with infection. CONCLUSION: Pathogenic infection induced changes in DNA methylation and impaired the barrier function of cultured primary gingival epithelial cells, which suggests a mechanism for systemic consequences of periodontal disease. Inhibition of these events by non-nucleoside DNMT inhibitors represents a potential strategy to treat periodontal disease. This article is protected by copyright.

The IL-6 receptor-blocking monoclonal antibody tocilizumab has been repurposed for COVID-19, but prospective trials and dose-finding studies in COVID-19 have not yet fully reported. We conducted a single-arm phase II trial of low-dose tocilizumab in nonintubated hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19, radiographic pulmonary infiltrate, fever, and C-reactive protein (CRP) &#8805; 40 mg/L. We hypothesized that doses significantly lower than the emerging standards of 400 mg or 8 mg/kg would resolve clinical and laboratory indicators of hyperinflammation. A dose range from 40 to 200 mg was evaluated, with allowance for one repeat dose at 24 to 48 hours. The primary objective was to assess the relationship of dose to fever resolution and CRP response. Thirty-two patients received low-dose tocilizumab, with the majority experiencing fever resolution (75%) and CRP decline consistent with IL-6 pathway abrogation (86%) in the 24-48 hours following drug administration. There was no evidence of a relationship between dose and fever resolution or CRP decline over the dose range of 40-200 mg. Within the 28-day follow-up, 5 (16%) patients died. For patients who recovered, median time to clinical recovery was 3 days (interquartile range, 2-5). Clinically presumed and/or cultured bacterial superinfections were reported in 5 (16%) patients. Low-dose tocilizumab was associated with rapid improvement in clinical and laboratory measures of hyperinflammation in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

343803,Linguistic Humor in Memes to Mitigate Post Covid-19 Severity (preprint),2020,"Millions of North Americans stopped riding public transit in response to COVID-19. We treat this crisis as a natural experiment to illustrate the importance of public transit in riders’ abilities to access essential destinations. We measured the impacts of riders forgoing transit through a survey of transportation barriers completed by more than 4,000 transit riders in Toronto and Vancouver (Canada). We used Heckman selection models to predict six dimensions of transport disadvantage and transport-related social exclusions captured in our survey. We then complemented model results with an analysis of survey comments describing barriers that individuals faced. Lack of access to alternative modes is the strongest predictor of a former rider experiencing transport disadvantage, particularly neighborhood walkability and vehicle ownership. Groups at risk of transport disadvantage before COVID-19, particularly women and people in poorer health, were also more likely to report difficulties while avoiding public transit. Barriers described by respondents included former supports no longer offering rides, gendered household car use dynamics, and lack of culturally specific or specialized amenities within walking distance.Policymakers should plan for a level of redundancy in transportation systems that enables residents to access essential destinations when unexpected service losses occur. Designing communities that enable residents to walk to those essential destinations will help reduce the burdens faced by transit riders during crises that render transit unfeasible. At the same time, planners championing active travel as an alternative to transit during such crises also need to devise solutions for former transit riders for whom active travel is ill suited, for example, due to physical challenges with carrying groceries or needing to chaperone children.

Among other, SARS-CoV-2 targets renal tubular cells and can cause acute renal damage. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the usefulness of urinary parameters in predicting intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mortality and development of AKI in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Retrospective observational study, in a tertiary care hospital, between March 1st and April 19th, 2020. We recruited adult patients admitted consecutively and positive for SARS-CoV-2. Urinary and serum biomarkers were correlated with clinical outcomes (AKI, ICU admission, hospital discharge and in-hospital mortality) and evaluated using a logistic regression model and ROC curves. A total of 199 COVID-19 hospitalized patients were included. In AKI, the logistic regression model with a highest area under the curve (AUC) was reached by the combination of urine blood and previous chronic kidney disease, with an AUC of 0.676 (95%CI 0.512-0.840; p = 0.023); urine specific weight, sodium and albumin in serum, with an AUC of 0.837 (95% CI 0.766-0.909; p < 0.001) for ICU admission; and age, urine blood and lactate dehydrogenase levels in serum, with an AUC of 0.923 (95%CI 0.866-0.979; p < 0.001) for mortality prediction. For hospitalized patients with COVID-19, renal involvement and early alterations of urinary and serum parameters are useful as prognostic factors of AKI, the need for ICU admission and death.","Morell-Garcia, Daniel; Ramos-Chavarino, David; Bauça, Josep M; Argente Del Castillo, Paula; Ballesteros-Vizoso, Maria Antonieta; García de Guadiana-Romualdo, Luis; Gómez-Cobo, Cristina; Pou, J Albert; Amezaga-Menéndez, Rocío; Alonso-Fernández, Alberto; Llompart, Isabel; García-Raja, Ana",Sci Rep,,476

344767,Evaluation of Triage Tests When Existing Test Capacity Is Constrained: Application to Rapid Diagnostic Testing in COVID-19,2021,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an emergent infectious pathogen causing an acute respiratory disease called corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Virus transmission may occur by contact, droplet, airborne or via contaminated surfaces. In efforts to effectively control the COVID-19 outbreak, the world health organization (WHO) and the Saudi Ministry of Health (MOH) have advised the public to practice protective measures to reduce transmission of the virus and reduce incidence of infection. These measures include hand washing, wearing masks and gloves and avoidance of touching the face with unwashed hands. The current study aimed to investigate knowledge and adherence of the Saudi population to these protective actions during the pandemic. After determining the required sample size using power analysis, a cross-sectional online self-reported survey of 5105 Saudi residents was conducted between 25th March to 17th April 2020 to evaluate public knowledge of COVID-19. Participants were all aged 18 years or above, Arabic speakers and residents of Saudi Arabia. Scores were calculated based on knowledge and adherence of the individuals to protective measures. About 90% of participants exhibited a high level of knowledge (scored 2/2) and practice (scored > 3/6) in relation to hand hygiene and wearing gloves and masks. Practice scores were positively associated with females and individuals with high income. Lower practice scores were linked to youth and residents of the northern and western regions of the Kingdom. Over two thirds of participants preferred hand washing to alcohol disinfection, and the frequency and performance of hand washing improved during the pandemic for more than half of respondents. Overall, the findings reflected high public knowledge of SARS-CoV2 transmission routes and adherence to personal protective measures. However, public awareness campaigns with an emphasis on the youth and individuals with low education and income are required to improve overall practice.","Bazaid, Abdulrahman S; Aldarhami, Abdu; Binsaleh, Naif K; Sherwani, Subuhi; Althomali, Omar W",PLoS One,,476
344917,"Foreign Sovereign Immunity and COVID-19 Lawsuits Against China [May 15, 2020]",2020,"We propose an interdisciplinary framework, Bayesian formal predictive model checking (Bayes FPMC), which combines Bayesian predictive inference, a well established tool in statistics, with formal verification methods rooting in the computer science community. Bayesian predictive inference allows for coherently incorporating uncertainty about unknown quantities by making use of methods or models that produce predictive distributions which in turn inform decision problems. By formalizing these problems and the corresponding properties, we can use spatio-temporal reach and escape logic to probabilistically assess their satisfaction. This way, competing models can directly be ranked according to how well they solve the actual problem at hand. The approach is illustrated on an urban mobility application, where the crowdedness in the center of Milan is proxied by aggregated mobile phone traffic data. We specify several desirable spatio-temporal properties related to city crowdedness such as a fault tolerant network or the reachability of hospitals. After verifying these properties on draws from the posterior predictive distributions, we compare several spatio-temporal Bayesian models based on their overall and property-based predictive performance.","Vana, Laura; Visconti, Ennio; Nenzi, Laura; Cadonna, Annalisa; Kastner, Gregor",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.01360v1.pdf,476

345239,Introduction to the special series: translating behavioral medicine research to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19,2020,"A possible source of microplastics has started to be released into nature because of the single-use face masks that protect us against the spread of COVID-19 and are being thrown onto the streets and into seas and nature. This study aims to estimate the amount of face mask use during the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey, thereby expressing our concerns about waste management and plastic pollution and calling on appropriate solid waste management policies and governments to take the necessary measures to formulate their strategies at all levels. In this context, the number of masks in an area of 1 km2 in 3 different cities was determined theoretically and experimentally. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) were also used to evaluate plastic polymer characteristics of the single-use face mask. It was determined that the three cities produce roughly 10 tons of face masks in a day. With the increasing use of single-use plastics, the impact of face masks on microplastic pollution is of great concern. Although studies on the recovery of disposable masks continue, the level is insufficient.

However, it is possible that social relationships might have a protective effect. In the present study, we examine how the COVID-19 pandemic affected older adults' well-being and loneliness, and the role of structural and functional characteristics of social relationships. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We use data from 99 older adults in Switzerland who participated (a) in a three-week micro-longitudinal study on social relationships and well-being in 2019 and (b) in a weekly online survey during four weeks of the COVID-19 lockdown. RESULTS: Our findings show that the global pandemic had substantial adverse effects on older adults' emotional well-being and loneliness. In addition, aspects of social relationships were related to loneliness both before and during the pandemic. Only one functional feature of social relationships (satisfaction with communication during the pandemic) buffered adverse effects of the major stressful event. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Although the social distancing measures during COVID-19 presented a major stressor for older adults' well-being and loneliness, being able to maintain social communication to a satisfactory level during that time reduced this effect. Therefore, enabling older adults to stay in touch with their social circle based on their personal preferences might reduce the impact that any future lockdown might have on their well-being.","Macdonald, Birthe; Hülür, Gizem",GerontologistGerontologist,,476
346320,In-home video chat for young children and their incarcerated parents,2020,"The global explosion of COVID-19 has brought unprecedented challenges to traditional higher education, especially for freshmen who have no major;they cannot determine what their real talents are. Thus, it is difficult for them to make correct choices based on their skills. Generally, existing methods mainly mine isomorphic information, ignoring relationships among heterogeneous information. Therefore, this paper proposes a new framework to give freshmen appropriate recommendations by mining heterogeneous educational information. This framework is composed of five stages: after data preprocessing, a weighted heterogeneous educational network (WHEN) is constructed according to heterogeneous information in student historical data. Then, the WHEN is projected into different subnets, on which metapaths are defined. Next, a WHEN-based embedding method is proposed, which helps mine the weighted heterogeneous information on multiple extended metapaths. Finally, with the information mined, a matrix factorization algorithm is used to recommend learning resources and majors for freshmen. A large number of experimental results show that the proposed framework can achieve better results than other baseline methods. This indicates that the proposed method is effective and can provide great help to freshmen during the COVID-19 storm. CCBY","Xiao, X.; Sun, R.; Yao, Z.; Zhang, C.; Chen, X.",IEEE Access,,476

METHODS: This retrospective review includes 154 patients with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia diagnosed between February 11 and 20, 2020, and 100 patients with other types of viral pneumonia diagnosed between April 2011 and December 2020 from two hospitals. High-resolution CT (HRCT) of the chest was performed. Data on location, distribution, attenuation, maximum lesion range, lobe involvement, number of lesions, air bronchogram signs, Hilar and mediastinal lymph node enlargement, and pleural effusion were collected. Associations between imaging characteristics and COVID-19 pneumonia were analyzed with univariate and multivariate logistic regression models. RESULTS: A peripheral distribution was associated with a 13.04-fold risk of COVID-19 pneumonia, compared with a diffuse distribution. A maximum lesion range > 10 cm was associated with a 9.75-fold risk of COVID-19 pneumonia, compared with a maximum lesion range &#8804; 5 cm, and the involvement of 5 lobes was associated with an 8.45-fold risk of COVID-19 pneumonia, compared with a maximum lesion range &#8804; 2. No pleural effusion was associated with a 3.58-fold risk of COVID-19 pneumonia compared with the presence of pleural effusion. Hilar and mediastinal lymph node enlargement was associated with a 2.79-fold risk of COVID-19 pneumonia. CONCLUSION: A peripheral distribution, a lesion range > 10 cm, involvement of 5 lobes, presence of hilar and mediastinal lymph node enlargement, and no pleural effusion were significantly associated with 2019-novel coronavirus pneumonia. KEY POINTS: â¢ A peripheral distribution, a lesion range > 10 cm, involvement of 5 lobes, presence of hilar and mediastinal lymph node enlargement, and no pleural effusion were significantly associated with COVID-19 compared with other types of viral pneumonia.","Li, Xiao; Fang, Xu; Bian, Yun; Lu, Jianping",Eur Radiol,,476

As the number of affected patients increase rapidly, manual severity assessment becomes a labor-intensive task, and may lead to delayed treatment. Purpose: Using machine learning method to realize automatic severity assessment (non-severe or severe) of COVID-19 based on chest CT images, and to explore the severity-related features from the resulting assessment model. Materials and Method: Chest CT images of 176 patients (age 45.3$\pm$16.5 years, 96 male and 80 female) with confirmed COVID-19 are used, from which 63 quantitative features, e.g., the infection volume/ratio of the whole lung and the volume of ground-glass opacity (GGO) regions, are calculated. A random forest (RF) model is trained to assess the severity (non-severe or severe) based on quantitative features. Importance of each quantitative feature, which reflects the correlation to the severity of COVID-19, is calculated from the RF model. Results: Using three-fold cross validation, the RF model shows promising results, i.e., 0.933 of true positive rate, 0.745 of true negative rate, 0.875 of accuracy, and 0.91 of area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The resulting importance of quantitative features shows that the volume and its ratio (with respect to the whole lung volume) of ground glass opacity (GGO) regions are highly related to the severity of COVID-19, and the quantitative features calculated from the right lung are more related to the severity assessment than those of the left lung. Conclusion: The RF based model can achieve automatic severity assessment (non-severe or severe) of COVID-19 infection, and the performance is promising. Several quantitative features, which have the potential to reflect the severity of COVID-19, were revealed.","Tang, Zhenyu; Zhao, Wei; Xie, Xingzhi; Zhong, Zheng; Shi, Feng; Liu, Jun; Shen, Dinggang",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.11988v1.pdf,476
347269,The syndrome of Toulouse-Lautrec,2021,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has attracted increasing worldwide attention. While diabetes is known to aggravate COVID-19 severity, it is not known whether nondiabetic patients with metabolic dysfunction are also more prone to more severe disease. The association of metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) with COVID-19 severity in nondiabetic patients was investigated here. METHODS: The study cohort comprised 65 patients with (i.e. cases) and 65 patients without MAFLD (i.e. controls). Each case was randomly matched with one control by sex (1:1) and age (±5 years). The association between the presence of MAFLD (as exposure) and COVID-19 severity (as the outcome) was assessed by binary logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: In nondiabetic patients with COVID-19, the presence of MAFLD was associated with a four-fold increased risk of severe COVID-19; the risk increased with increasing numbers of metabolic risk factors. The association with COVID-19 severity persisted after adjusting for age, sex, and coexisting morbid conditions. CONCLUSION: Health-care professionals caring for nondiabetic patients with COVID-19 should be cognizant of the increased likelihood of severe COVID-19 in patients with MAFLD.","Gao, Feng; Zheng, Kenneth I; Wang, Xiao-Bo; Yan, Hua-Dong; Sun, Qing-Feng; Pan, Ke-Hua; Wang, Ting-Yao; Chen, Yong-Ping; George, Jacob; Zheng, Ming-Hua",J. gastroenterol. hepatol,,476

In the current study, we aimed to investigate the effect of this unexpected context on sleep. METHODS: During the COVID-19 outbreak, we performed an online survey with individuals formerly recruited for validation of the Spanish version of the sleep questionnaire Satisfaction, Alertness, Timing, Efficiency, and Duration (SATED). In the current survey, we asked the participants to complete the previously answered questionnaires including the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), a modified version of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and the SATED questionnaire. We also assessed the mood by the Profile of Mood States (POMS) questionnaire. RESULTS: The 71 participants were mostly women (75%) with a mean (± SD) age of 40.7 ± 11.9 years. Comparing the previous PSQI score to that during the COVID-19 outbreak, we observed worsening sleep quality (5.45 ± 3.14 to 6.18 ± 3.03 points, p = 0.035). In parallel, there was an increase in the negative mood (p = 0.002). Accordingly, the decrease in sleep quality was substantially correlated with negative mood (p < 0.001). There were no differences in the ESS or SATED. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 outbreak-associated events correlate with decreased sleep quality in association with an increase in negative mood. Considering the importance of sleep for a healthy life, and in particular for immune function, efforts should be made to improve awareness on this matter and to offer psychological assistance to affected individuals.","Targa, Adriano D S; Benítez, Iván D; Moncusí-Moix, Anna; Arguimbau, Maria; de Batlle, Jordi; Dalmases, Mireia; Barbé, Ferran",Sleep breath,,476

We searched Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from December 1, 2019 to April 27, 2020. We also searched the bibliographies of included studies, COVID-19 evidence repositories and living evidence maps, and consulted with expert colleagues internationally. We included studies identified through these supplementary sources up to June 25, 2020. We included English-language peer-reviewed quantitative studies that used primary data to describe the social determinants of COVID-19 incidence, clinical presentation, health service use and outcomes in adults with a confirmed or presumptive diagnosis of COVID-19. Two reviewers extracted data and conducted quality assessment, confirmed by a third reviewer. Forty-two studies met inclusion criteria. The strongest evidence was from three large observational studies that found associations between race or ethnicity and socioeconomic deprivation and increased likelihood of COVID-19 incidence and subsequent hospitalization. Limited evidence was available on other key determinants, including occupation, educational attainment, housing status and food security. Assessing associations between sociodemographic factors and COVID-19 was limited by small samples, descriptive study designs, and the timeframe of our search. Systematic reviews of literature published subsequently are required to fully understand the magnitude of any effects and predictive utility of sociodemographic factors related to COVID-19 incidence and outcomes.

350925,Pre-COVID-19 deterrents to practicing with videoconferencing telepsychology among psychologists who didn't,2020,"Epidemic control may be hampered when the percentage of asymptomatic cases is high. Seeking remedies for this problem, test positivity was explored between the first 60 to 90 epidemic days in six countries that reported their first COVID-19 case between February and March 2020: Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Cuba, Mexico, and Uruguay. Test positivity (TP) is the percentage of test-positive individuals reported on a given day out of all individuals tested the same day. To generate both country-specific and multi-country information, this study was implemented in two stages. First, the epidemiologic data of the country infected last (Uruguay) were analyzed. If at least one TP-related analysis yielded a statistically significant relationship, later assessments would investigate the six countries. The Uruguayan data indicated (i) a positive correlation between daily TP and daily new cases (râ¯=â¯0.75); (ii) a negative correlation between TP and the number of tests conducted per million inhabitants (TPMI, râ¯=â¯-0.66); and (iii) three temporal stages, which differed from one another in both TP and TPMI medians (pâ¯<â¯0.01) and, together, revealed a negative relationship between TPMI and TP. No significant relationship was found between TP and the number of active or recovered patients. The six countries showed a positive correlation between TP and the number of deaths/million inhabitants (DMI, râ¯=â¯0.65, pâ¯<â¯0.01). With one exception -a country where isolation was not pursued-, all countries showed a negative correlation between TP and TPMI (râ¯=â¯0.74). The temporal analysis of country-specific policies revealed four patterns, characterized by: (1) low TPMI and high DMI, (2) high TPMI and low DMI; (3) an intermediate pattern, and (4) high TPMI and high DMI. Findings support the hypothesis that test positivity may guide epidemiologic policy-making, provided that policy-related factors are considered and high-resolution geographical data are utilized.","Fasina, Folorunso O; Salami, Mudasiru A; Fasina, Modupe M; Otekunrin, Olutosin A; Hoogesteijn, Almira L; Hittner, James B",Methods (S.

Under the state of emergency, in addition to school closure, after-school care has not been sufficiently supplied. We independently collected individual level data through internet surveys to construct short panel data from mid-March to mid-June 2020, which covered before and after the state of emergency. We analyze how the presence of school-aged children influences their parents views about working from home. After controlling for various factors using a fixed effects model, we find that in cases where parents were workers, and the children are (1) in primary school, parents are willing to promote working from home. If children are (2) in junior high school, the parents view is hardly affected. (3) Surprisingly, workers whose children are primary school pupils are most likely to support promotion of working from home after schools reopen. Due to school closure and a lack of after-school care, parents need to work from home, and this experience motivated workers with small children to continue doing so to improve work-life balance even after schools reopen.","Yamamura, Eiji; Tsutsui, Yoshiro",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.08480v1.pdf,476
351704,Tourism in the Era of Covid-19 and Its Impact on the Environment,2021,"Travel restrictions have become a common disease control measure during the 2019 Coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19). Measures have ranged from quarantines when entering a country to outright travel bans. Yet more widespread travel restrictions in the form of country vaccine entry requirements have been in place for a long time for another disease - yellow fever. We track the historical underpinnings and policy developments that have led to stringent vaccine entry requirements today. We also discuss the political issues raised by health measures imposed on borders and discuss the reasons behind some clear regional differences. Almost no European countries currently have vaccine entry requirements, while at the other end of the spectrum, the majority of countries in the African region do, making vaccine entry requirements a global south phenomenon. We argue that vaccine entry requirements should be reassessed in the future as an underused public health tool, likely to become increasingly common. Vaccine entry requirements have proved effective in controlling the international spread of yellow fever but more can be done to ensure better use of this measure. Caution is needed due to the close links between public health and politics, evident since the first travel restriction in quarantines.","Vanderslott, Samantha; Marks, Tatjana",Glob Public Health,,476

Tourist visits during the COVID-19 pandemic decreased dramatically. To overcome this situation, serious efforts are needed to keep tourist destinations in demand by visitors, including the case study of Gembira Loka Zoo (GLZoo) Yogyakarta. One of the efforts taken by GLZoo managers is through social media, such as Instagram, in order to maintain the brand awareness of GLZoo as a tourist destination. Tourist destinations that are closely related to social media, in which there is a term that has an important meaning and role, namely online engagement which is a psychological response from social media users (Instagram). Online engagement aims to see how much the uploads on Instagram social media have achieved. This paper uses a qualitative descriptive research method, namely finding a fact with the correct interpretation. Hopefully, with marketing communication using Instagram, it is so that brand awareness in the minds of consumers is maintained, the final goal is of course the top of mind stage. In addition, to get maximum engagements, the GLZoo Instagram account manager seems to have to pay attention to several factors: 1). type of content, 2) upload time, 3) caption, and 4) hashtags. So, when tourists have thoughts of wanting to travel in a category that suits GLZoo, the first thing that tourists remember is GLZoo spontaneously without any assistance or stimulus.","Fithriya, Dwi Nur Laela",Jurnal Sosiologi Reflektif,,476

352758,Emergency Management of Mental Hospitals during the Outbreak of COVID-19,2020,"The extended and diverse interference of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in multiple host functions and the diverse associated symptoms implicate its involvement in fundamental cellular regulatory processes. The activity of ten-eleven translocase 2 (TET2) responsible for selective DNA demethylation, has been recently identified as a regulator of endogenous virus inactivation and viral invasion, possibly by proteasomal deregulation of the TET2/TET3 activities. In a recent report, we presented a detailed list of factors that can be affected by TET activity, including recognition of zinc finger protein binding sites and bimodal promoters, by enhancing the flexibility of adjacent sequences. In this review, we summarize the TET-associated processes and factors that could account for SARS-CoV-2 diverse symptoms. Moreover, we provide a correlation for the observed virus-induced symptoms that have been previously associated with TET activities by in vitro and in vitro studies. These include early hypoxia, neuronal regulation, smell and taste development, liver, intestinal, and cardiomyocyte differentiation. Finally, we propose that the high mortality of SARS-CoV-2 among adult patients, the different clinical symptoms of adults compared to children, the higher risk of patients with metabolic deregulation, and the low mortality rates among women can all be accounted for by the complex balance of the three enzymes with TET activity, which is developmentally regulated. This activity is age-dependent, related to telomere homeostasis and integrity, and associated with X chromosome inactivation via (de)regulation of the responsible XIST gene expression.","Kouidou, Sofia; Malousi, Andigoni; Andreou, Alexandra-Zoi",,,476

The implications are much beyond just health crisis, and it has long-lasting psychosocial and economic implications. Although the psychological offshoots such as depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress, and sleep disturbances are being studied in-depth, there is a dearth of literature on the sexual well-being and sexual practices during this pandemic. Considering the physical distancing; travel restrictions; the high human-human transmission rate; misinformation and uncertainty about the sexual routes of transmission for SARS-CoV-2; and fear about intimacy, sexuality, and safe sexual practices have increased significantly. This is more prominent in newly settled or distanced couples and the frontline health workers, with increased risk exposure to the virus. For them, guilt and distress associated with sexual relationships might increase primary psychiatric and sexual disorders. This, in turn, impacts relationships and emotional bonding in couples and affects healthy coping during the pandemic crisis. Although sexual abstinence is the safest practice to prevent transmission, it is not practically feasible in all cases. Risk reduction counseling, sex with quarantined partners, and digital sex are other options that are worth exploring. There are additional concerns of digital safety, unhealthy use of technology, cyber-crimes, and online extortion. Keeping this in the background, this advocacy article glances through the effects of past outbreaks on sexuality, reviews the current recommendations, and proposes methods and approaches for sexual well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic, which is vital for overall public health.","Banerjee, Debanjan; Rao, T S Sathyanarayana",Indian J Psychiatry,,476
353229,Towards precision delivery of ECMO in COVID-19 cardiorespiratory failure,2020,"New Orleans was one of the first cities in the USA to be severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. This article draws on long-term ethnography and recent remote fieldwork to explore how new-wave carnival krewes in New Orleans responded to the pandemic. New-wave krewes are one of the kinds of social clubs that produce carnival each year. During the first four months of the pandemic, some of them undertook various kinds of projects within their membership and in the broader community. I propose that these projects have three overlapping dimensions: creativity, sociability, and solidarity. My argument is that because they are so enmeshed in the social fabric of New Orleans, new-wave carnival krewes provided a solid foundation for social initiatives that sought to alleviate the existential and material insecurity of the pandemic. I further argue that carnival has emerged as an important way for New Orleanians to make the imaginative connection between the personal and the social that is necessary for grasping the scope of COVID-19. More broadly, I contribute to what Joel Robbins has called an ""anthropology of the good"" in social relations. © 2021 University of Toronto. All rights reserved.","Radice, M.",Anthropologica,,476
353543,‘Wash Your Hand!’: The Old Message From Florence Nightingale To Battle COVID-19,2020,"Background: COVID-19 has affected care home residents internationally, but detailed information on outbreaks is scarce. We aimed to describe the evolution of outbreaks of COVID-19 in all care homes in one large health region in Scotland. Methods: We did a population analysis of testing, cases, and deaths in care homes in the National Health Service (NHS) Lothian health region of the UK. We obtained data for COVID-19 testing (PCR testing of nasopharyngeal swabs for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) and deaths (COVID-19-related and non-COVID-19-related), and we analysed data by several variables including type of care home, number of beds, and locality. Outcome measures were timing of outbreaks, number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in care home residents, care home characteristics associated with the presence of an outbreak, and deaths of residents in both care homes and hospitals. We calculated excess deaths (both COVID-19-related and non-COVID-19-related), which we defined as the sum of deaths over and above the historical average in the same period over the past 5 years. Findings: Between March 10 and Aug 2, 2020, residents at 189 care homes (5843 beds) were tested for COVID-19 when symptomatic. A COVID-19 outbreak was confirmed at 69 (37%) care homes, of which 66 (96%) were care homes for older people. The size of care homes for older people was strongly associated with a COVID-19 outbreak (odds ratio per 20-bed increase 3·35, 95% CI 1·99-5·63). 907 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were recorded during the study period, and 432 COVID-19-related deaths. 229 (25%) COVID-19-related cases and 99 (24%) COVID-related deaths occurred in five (3%) of 189 care homes, and 441 (49%) cases and 207 (50%) deaths were in 13 (7%) care homes. 411 (95%) COVID-19-related deaths occurred in the 69 care homes with a confirmed COVID-19 outbreak, 19 (4%) deaths were in hospital, and two (<1%) were in one of the 120 care homes without a confirmed COVID-19 outbreak. At the 69 care homes with a confirmed COVID-19 outbreak, 74 excess non-COVID-19-related deaths were reported, whereas ten non-COVID-19-related excess deaths were observed in the 120 care homes without a confirmed COVID-19 outbreak. 32 fewer non-COVID-19-related deaths than expected were reported among care home residents in hospital. Interpretation: The effect of COVID-19 on care homes has been substantial but concentrated in care homes with known outbreaks. A key implication from our findings is that, if community incidence of COVID-19 increases again, many care home residents will be susceptible. Shielding care home residents from potential sources of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and ensuring rapid action to minimise outbreak size if infection is introduced, will be important for any second wave.

354492,Does COVID-19 as a Long Wave Turning Point Mean the End of Neoliberalism?,2020,"Several major cities that witnessed heavy air pollution by particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) have contributed to high rate of infection and severity of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Owing to the negative impact of COVID-19 on health and economy, it is imperative to predict the pandemic trend of the COVID-19 outbreak. Pakistan is one of the mostly affected countries by recent COVID-19 pandemic in terms of COVID-cases and economic crises. Like other several Asian countries to combat the virus impacts, Pakistan implemented non-pharmacological interventions (NPI), such as national lockdowns. The current study investigates the effect of major interventions across three out of four provinces of Pakistan for the period from the start of the COVID-19 in March 22, 2020 until June 30, 2020, when lockdowns were started to be eased. High-resolution data on NO2 was recorded from Sentinel-5's Precursor spacecraft with TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (Sentinel-5P TROPOMI). Similarly, PM2.5 data were collected from sampling sties to investigate possible correlation among these pollutants and COVID-19. In addition, growth and susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) models utilizing time-series data of COVID-19 from February 26 to December 31, 2020, with- and without NPI that encompass the predicted number of infected cases, peak time, impact on the healthcare system and mortality in Pakistan. Maximum mean PM2.5 concentration of 108 µgm-3 was recorded for Lahore with the range from 51 to 215 µgm-3, during strict lockdown (L), condition. This is three times higher than Pak-EPA and US-EPA and four times for WHO guidelines, followed by Peshawar (97.2 and 58 ± 130), Islamabad (83 and 158 ± 58), and Karachi (78 and 50 ± 140). The majority of sampling sites in Lahore showed NO2 levels higher than 8.75E-5 (mol/m2) in 2020 compared to 2019 during ""L"" period. The susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model depicted a strong correlation (r) between the predicted and reported cases for Punjab (r = 0.79), Sindh (r = 0.91), Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) (r = 94) and Islamabad (r = 0.85). Findings showed that major NPI and lockdowns especially have had a large effect on minimizing transmission. Continued community intervention should be undertaken to keep transmission of SARS-CoV-2 under control in cities where higher incidence of COVID-19 cases until the vaccine is available. This study provides a methodological framework that if adopted can assist epidemiologist and policy makers to be well-prepared in advance in cities where PM2.5 concentration and NO2 levels are already high in order to minimize the potential risk of further spread of COVID-19 cases.","Mehmood, Khalid; Bao, Yansong; Petropoulos, George P; Abbas, Roman; Abrar, Muhammad Mohsin; Mustafa, Adnan; Soban, Ahmad; Saud, Shah; Ahmad, Manzoor; Hussain, Izhar; Fahad, Shah",Chemosphere,,476

There is no adequate information to evaluate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on acute appendicitis and its surgical management. The present comparative study reports successful appendectomy and infection control in patients with appendicitis during the COVID-19 pandemic and last year covering the same period. METHODS: This retrospective observational study was conducted in acute appendicitis-treated patients from 13.03.19 to 13.05.19 and from 13.03.20 to 13.05.20, respectively. RESULTS: This study included 150 patients (110 patients in 2019; 40 patients in 2020 (during COVID-19 pandemic)). The patients were named as Group A (Normal period) and Group B (Pandemic period), respectively. The groups were comparable as there was no significant difference between the mean age, mean BMI, and mean length of stay. There is a significant difference between the comorbidities of Group A and Group B (p=0.033). There was no significant difference between the laboratory and radiological findings of Group A and Group B. There was a significant difference between the perforation number of Group A and Group B (p=0.029). There was no significant difference between the needs of ICU and conversion from laparoscopic to conventional appendectomy of Group A and Group B. CONCLUSION: The findings obtained in this study suggest that late admission to the hospital caused complicated cases and made acute appendicitis management more difficult during the pandemic period, which was already a troubling period. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the principles applied to emergency surgery for infected patients should be applied to both suspected and confirmed cases.","Meriç, Serhat; Vartanoglu Aktokmakyan, Talar; Tokocin, Merve; Aktimur, Yunus Emre; Hacim, Nadir Adnan; Gülcicek, Osman Bilgin",Ulus Travma Acil Cerrahi Derg,,476

We surveyed oncology stakeholders in order to assess their attitudes pertaining to social media and how it has been affected during the pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 40-item survey was distributed to stakeholders from 8 July to 22 July 2020 and was promoted through the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) and the OncoAlert Network. RESULTS: One thousand and seventy-six physicians and stakeholders took part in the survey. In total, 57.3% of respondents were medical oncologists, 50.6% aged <40 years, 50.8% of female gender and mostly practicing in Europe (51.5%). More than 90% of respondents considered social media a useful tool for distributing scientific information and for education. Most used social media to stay up to date on cancer care in general (62.5%) and cancer care during COVID-19 (61%) given the constant flow of information. Respondents also used social media to interact with other oncologists (78.8%) and with patients (34.4%). Overall, 61.1% of respondents were satisfied with the role that social media was playing during the COVID-19 pandemic. On the other hand, 41.1% of respondents reported trouble in discriminating between credible and less credible information and 30% stated social networks were a source of stress. For this reason, one-third of respondents reduced its use during the COVID-19 pandemic. Regarding meeting attendance, a total of 59.1% of responding physicians preferred in-person meetings to virtual ones, and 51.8% agreed that virtual meetings and social distancing could hamper effective collaboration. CONCLUSION: Social media has a useful role in supporting cancer care and professional engagement in oncology. Although one-third of respondents reported reduced use of social media due to stress during the COVID-19 pandemic, the majority found social media useful to keep up to date and were satisfied with the role social media was playing during the pandemic.","Morgan, G; Tagliamento, M; Lambertini, M; Devnani, B; Westphalen, B; Dienstmann, R; Bozovic-Spasojevic, I; Calles, A; Criscitiello, C; Curioni, A; Garcia, A M; Lamarca, A; Pilotto, S; Scheffler, M; Strijbos, M; Wong, R; de Azambuja, E; Peters, S",ESMO Open,,476
356225,COVID-19 fears may widen gaps in early pregnancy care,2020,"Pneumonia is a serious complication associated with inflammation of the lungs due to infection with viral pathogens. Seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses, variola virus (agent of smallpox) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; agent of COVID-19) are some leading examples. Viral pneumonia is triggered by excessive inflammation associated with dysregulated cytokine production, termed 'cytokine storm'. Several cytokines have been implicated but tumour necrosis factor (TNF) plays a critical role in driving lung inflammation, severe lung pathology and death. Despite this, the exact role TNF plays in the aetiology and pathogenesis of virus infection-induced respiratory complications is not well understood. In this review, we discuss the pathological and immunomodulatory roles of TNF in contributing to immunopathology and resolution of lung inflammation, respectively, in mouse models of influenza- and smallpox (mousepox)-induced pneumonia. We review studies that have investigated dampening of inflammation on the outcome of severe influenza and orthopoxvirus infections. Most studies on the influenza model have evaluated the efficacy of treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs, including anti-TNF agents, in animal models on the day of viral infection. We question the merits of those studies as they are not transferable to the clinic given that individuals generally present at a hospital only after the onset of disease symptoms and not on the day of infection. We propose that research should be directed at determining whether dampening lung inflammation after the onset of disease symptoms will reduce morbidity and mortality. Such a treatment strategy will be more relevant clinically.","Pandey, Pratikshya; Karupiah, Gunasegaran",FEBS j,,476

In this article, we focus on the protective strategies that all people, but in this case healthcare providers, use when facing danger and how specific preventive responses could reduce the mental health burden to nurses, doctors, and emergency medical personnel working in hospitals. Our primary contributions are to demonstrate that healthcare providers are not a homogeneous group regarding mental health risks and that, consequently, individuals might need different forms of preventive and ameliorative response. We propose some (a) universally beneficial approaches, (b) strategy-specific approaches, and (c) strategy-specific contra-indicated approaches. Our two central points are that there are important psychological differences among healthcare providers and that these create different mental health needs in the COVID-19 crisis and require different protective solutions.

Closures included pain management departments where many staff were redeployed. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of COVID-19 on chronic pain services in the Republic of Ireland. METHODS: An online survey was sent to pain consultants working in public hospitals in the Republic of Ireland between the 22nd and 28th September 2020. RESULTS: We received responses from 18 consultants from all 15 public hospitals in the Republic of Ireland with chronic pain services. Procedural volume during lockdown fell to 26% of pre-COVID levels. This had recovered somewhat by the time of the survey to 71%. Similarly, in-person outpatient clinic volume fell to 10% of per-COVID numbers and recovered to 50%. On average, 39% of public hospital activity was made up for by the availability of private hospitals. This varied significantly across the country. The use of telemedicine increased significantly during the pandemic. Before COVID, on average, 13% of outpatient clinic volume was composed of telephone or video consultations. This increased to 46% at the time of the survey. CONCLUSION: This survey of consultant pain physicians in the Republic of Ireland has revealed how chronic pain services have been affected during the pandemic and how they have evolved.","Mullins, Cormac Francis; Harmon, Dominic; O039,; Connor, Therese",Ir. j. med. sci,,476

To offset disruption to life-saving treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD), several federal agencies granted exemptions to existing federal regulations. This included loosening restrictions on medications for OUD (MOUD), including methadone and buprenorphine. In this commentary, we briefly review policy and practice guidelines for treating OUD prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We then outline specific MOUD treatment policy and practice exemptions that went into effect in February and March 2020, and discuss the ways in which these unprecedented changes have dramatically changed MOUD treatment. Given the unprecedented nature of these changes, and unknown outcomes to date, we advocate for a data-driven approach to guide future policy and practice recommendations regarding MOUD. We outline several critical clinical, research, and policy questions that can inform MOUD treatment in a post-COVID-19 era.","Livingston, Nicholas A; Ameral, Victoria; Banducci, Anne N; Weisberg, Risa B",J Subst Abuse Treat,,476

COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 is reported to originate in December 2019 in Wuhan, China and spreading rapidly around world. SARS-CoV-2 is structurally similar to the other coronaviruses, causing the severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and the middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), both binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to enter human cells. ACE 2 is widely expressed in several cells including, neural tissue. COVID-19 presents with fever and respiratory symptoms, possibly leading to acute respiratory distress (ARDS) but there are several published reports of acute cerebrovascular diseases, seizures, olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions, isolated involvement of cranial nerves, myositis/rabdhomyolisis as well myasthenic crisis (MC) and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). The ARDS described during COVID-19 pandemic, coupled with respiratory muscle failure occurring in myasthenia gravis (MG), may result in a life-threatening condition, challenging for intensivists, pulmonologists and neurologists. Infections are recognized trigger of exacerbations and crisis in MG and patients with MG probably exhibit a mortality higher than the general population during this COVID-19 pandemic. We review the current state of knowledge on MG during the COVID-19 pandemic to focus the immunological and respiratory interplay between these two conditions.","Galassi, Giuliana; Marchioni, Alessandro",Acta Neurol Belg,,476

However, messaging has been inconsistent and unclear. OBJECTIVE: To determine COVID-19 awareness, knowledge, attitudes, and related behaviors among U.S. adults who are more vulnerable to complications of infection because of age and comorbid conditions. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey linked to 3 active clinical trials and 1 cohort study. SETTING: 5 academic internal medicine practices and 2 federally qualified health centers. PATIENTS: 630 adults aged 23 to 88 years living with 1 or more chronic conditions. MEASUREMENTS: Self-reported knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to COVID-19. RESULTS: A fourth (24.6%) of participants were ""very worried"" about getting the coronavirus. Nearly a third could not correctly identify symptoms (28.3%) or ways to prevent infection (30.2%). One in 4 adults (24.6%) believed that they were ""not at all likely"" to get the virus, and 21.9% reported that COVID-19 had little or no effect on their daily routine. One in 10 respondents was very confident that the federal government could prevent a nationwide outbreak. In multivariable analyses, participants who were black, were living below the poverty level, and had low health literacy were more likely to be less worried about COVID-19, to not believe that they would become infected, and to feel less prepared for an outbreak. Those with low health literacy had greater confidence in the federal government response. LIMITATION: Cross-sectional study of adults with underlying health conditions in 1 city during the initial week of the COVID-19 U.S. outbreak. CONCLUSION: Many adults with comorbid conditions lacked critical knowledge about COVID-19 and, despite concern, were not changing routines or plans. Noted disparities suggest that greater public health efforts may be needed to mobilize the most vulnerable communities.

To highlight the effect of environmental factors on pollution industry transfer, a triangle model with various combination scenarios of industry, location, and environmental factors is adopted to empirically study the transfer mechanism of China's pollution industry according to the panel data of 30 provinces from 2000 to 2018. The obtained results indicate that (1) industrial advantage is the primary factor of improving the transfer of pollution industry in China; especially, the significance of location and environmental indicators is significantly lower than that of industrial indicators. (2) With the increasing promotion of regional coordination strategy and ecological civilization construction, the attraction of location factors to industry transfer is decreasing, and the inhibition of environmental factors to pollution industry is increasing. (3) In addition, it is worth noting that China's pollution industry has not been in ""innovation highland"" but ""environmental depression,"" which indicates that the phenomenon of ""pollution haven hypothesis"" is probable in the industry transfer of China. The paper suggests that reasonable industry transfer should be adopted by all government levels to promote industrial transformation and upgrading with considering the environmental capacity.","Li, Chuang; Xia, Wenjing; Wang, Liping",Environ. sci. pollut. res. int.

METHODS: Adult patients testing positive on the RT-PCR COVID-19 test were sampled again within 48 h after administering topical oropharyngeal anaesthesia. Patients were asked to rate their discomfort on a visual analog scale (VAS) for both sample A and B. A qualitative real-time RT-PCR for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, was performed, and the cycle threshold value (Ct), used as a surrogate marker for the viral load, was measured for the sample taken without lignocaine (sample A) and the sample taken post-lignocaine application (sample B). The difference in Ct values of both the groups was checked for any statistical significance using paired t-test. Wilcoxon signed rank test was used on VAS scores to determine any significant decrease in discomfort. RESULTS: Forty patients were included in the study. Twenty-nine patients (72.5%) reported the procedure to be more comfortable post-lignocaine application. Median (IQR) discomfort on VAS decreased from 7 (1) to 5 (2) after lignocaine use, which was statistically significant (p < 0.05). Mean Ct value for sample A was 17.21 ± 5.25 and for sample B was 18.44 ± 4.8 (p > 0.05), indicating a non-significant effect of lignocaine on SARS-CoV-2 concentration in the sample.

360390,Face Covering Adherence in an Outpatient Ophthalmology Clinic during Covid-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 began spreading in December 2019 and has since become a pandemic that has impacted many aspects of human society. Several issues concerning the origin, time of introduction to humans, evolutionary patterns, and underlying force driving the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak remain unclear. METHOD: Genetic variation in 137 SARS-CoV-2 genomes and related coronaviruses as of 2/23/2020 was analyzed. RESULT: After correcting for mutational bias, the excess of low frequency mutations on both synonymous and nonsynonymous sites was revealed which is consistent with the recent outbreak of the virus. In contrast to adaptive evolution previously reported for SARS-CoV during its brief epidemic in 2003, our analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes shows signs of relaxation. The sequence similarity in the spike receptor binding domain between SARS-CoV-2 and a sequence from pangolin is probably due to an ancient intergenomic introgression that occurred approximately 40 years ago. The current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 was estimated to have originated on 12/11/2019 (95% HPD 11/13/2019-12/23/2019). The effective population size of the virus showed an approximately 20-fold increase from the onset of the outbreak to the lockdown of Wuhan (1/23/2020) and ceased to increase afterwards, demonstrating the effectiveness of social distancing in preventing its spread. Two mutations, 84S in orf8 protein and 251 V in orf3 protein, occurred coincidentally with human intervention. The former first appeared on 1/5/2020 and plateaued around 1/23/2020. The latter rapidly increased in frequency after 1/23/2020. Thus, the roles of these mutations on infectivity need to be elucidated. Genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 collected from China is two times higher than those derived from the rest of the world. A network analysis found that haplotypes collected from Wuhan were interior and had more mutational connections, both of which are consistent with the observation that the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak originated in China. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 might have cryptically circulated within humans for years before being discovered. Data from the early outbreak and hospital archives are needed to trace its evolutionary path and determine the critical steps required for effective spreading.","Chaw, Shu-Miaw; Tai, Jui-Hung; Chen, Shi-Lun; Hsieh, Chia-Hung; Chang, Sui-Yuan; Yeh, Shiou-Hwei; Yang, Wei-Shiung; Chen, Pei-Jer; Wang, Hurng-Yi",J Biomed Sci,,476

A real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was performed using a nasopharyngeal swab. Because a positive result was seen, she was admitted on the 7th day of illness. On admission, the visual analogue scale (VAS) score for smell and taste was 0 of 100%.

In the odor identification test using 12 different odor cards, only 7 odors were correctly identified. On the 18th day of illness, SARS-CoV-2 tested negative in the RT-PCR test; simultaneously, the VAS score for smell and taste fully improved to 100 of 100%. On the 77th day of illness, full recovery was confirmed in the Alinamin test (latency, 7 seconds; duration, 82 seconds).

360767,Who complies with the restrictions to reduce the spread of COVID-19?: Personality and perceptions of the COVID-19 situation,2020,"Background: Liver injury is commonly seen in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the mechanism behind liver injury, particularly in severe and critical COVID-19 patients, remains unclear and the clinical course is poorly described. Methods: We conducted a single-center, retrospective cohort study of consecutive hospitalized severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients with or without liver injury who underwent immunologic testing (IL-6, IL-8, TNF-&#945;, and IL-1ß). Liver injury was defined as peak aminotransferases &#8805;3x ULN (40 U/L) or &#8805;120 U/L. Patients with liver injury were compared to those who had normal aminotransferases throughout the hospital course. Results: 176 patients were studied; 109 with liver injury and 67 controls. Patients with liver injury were more likely to be male (71.6% vs 37.3%; p < 0.001). Peak inflammatory markers and IL-6 were higher in the liver injury group: CRP: 247 vs 168 mg/L, p < 0.001; LDH: 706 vs 421 U/L, ferritin: 2,973 vs 751 ng/mL, p < 0.001, IL-6: 121.0 vs 71.8, p < 0.001. There was no difference in the levels of IL-8, TNF-&#945;, and IL-1ß. The liver injury group had a longer length of stay and more severe COVID-19 despite having less diabetes and chronic kidney disease. Discussion: An exaggerated hyper inflammatory response (cytokine storm) characterized by significantly elevated CRP, LDH, ferritin, and IL-6 levels and increasing severity of COVID-19 appears to be associated with the occurrence of liver injury in patients with severe/ critical COVID-19.","Da, Ben L; Kushner, Tatyana; El Halabi, Maan; Paka, Pavan; Khalid, Mian; Uberoi, Angad; Lee, Brian T; Perumalswami, Ponni V; Rutledge, Stephanie M; Schiano, Thomas D; Friedman, Scott; Saberi, Behnam",,,476
360967,Addressing the Digital Inverse Care Law in the Time of COVID-19: Potential for Digital Technology to Exacerbate or Mitigate Health Inequalities,2021,"In this paper, we use the Z-control approach to get further insight on the role of awareness in the management of epidemics that, just like Covid-19, display a high rate of overexposure because of the large number of asymptomatic people. We focus on a SEIR model including a overexposure mechanism and consider awareness as a time-dependent variable whose dynamics is not assigned a priori. Exploting the potential of awareness to produce social distancing and self-isolation among susceptibles, we use it as an indirect control on the class of infective individuals and apply the Z-control approach to detect what trend must awareness display over time in order to eradicate the disease. To this aim, we generalize the Z-control procedure to appropriately treat an uncontrolled model with more than two governing equations. Analytical and numerical investigations on the resulting Z-controlled system show its capability in controlling some representative dynamics within both the backward and the forward scenarios. The awareness variable is qualitatively compared to Google Trends data on Covid-19 that are discussed in the perspective of the Z-control approach, inferring qualitative indications in view of the disease control. The cases of Italy and New Zealand in the first phase of the pandemic are analyzed in detail. The theoretical framework of the Z-control approach can hence offer the chance to reflect on the use of Google Trends as a possible indicator of good management of the epidemic.","Lacitignola, Deborah; Diele, Fasma",Chaos Solitons Fractals,,476

362266,School Nurse Perspectives on COVID-19,2021,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive disease thought to result from impaired lung repair following injury and is strongly associated with aging. While vascular alterations have been associated with IPF previously, the contribution of lung vasculature during injury resolution and fibrosis is not well understood. To compare the role of endothelial cells (ECs) in resolving and non-resolving models of lung fibrosis, we applied bleomycin intratracheally to young and aged mice. We found that injury in aged mice elicited capillary rarefaction, while injury in young mice resulted in increased capillary density. ECs from the lungs of injured aged mice relative to young mice demonstrated elevated pro-fibrotic and reduced vascular homeostasis gene expression. Among the latter, Nos3 (encoding the enzyme endothelial nitric oxide synthase, eNOS) was transiently upregulated in lung ECs from young but not aged mice following injury. Young mice deficient in eNOS recapitulated the non-resolving lung fibrosis observed in aged animals following injury, suggesting that eNOS directly participates in lung fibrosis resolution. Activation of the NO receptor soluble guanylate cyclase in human lung fibroblasts reduced TGFß-induced pro-fibrotic gene and protein expression. Additionally, loss of eNOS in human lung ECs reduced the suppression of TGFß-induced lung fibroblast activation in 2D and 3D co-cultures. Altogether, our results demonstrate that persistent lung fibrosis in aged mice is accompanied by capillary rarefaction, loss of EC identity, and impaired eNOS expression. Targeting vascular function may thus be critical to promote lung repair and fibrosis resolution in aging and IPF.","Caporarello, Nunzia; Meridew, Jeffrey A; Aravamudhan, Aja; Jones, Dakota L; Austin, Susan A; Pham, Tho X; Haak, Andrew J; Moo Choi, Kyoung; Tan, Qi; Haresi, Adil; Huang, Steven K; Katusic, Zvonimir S; Tschumperlin, Daniel J; Ligresti, Giovanni",Aging Cell,,476

Recent studies have indicated that paramylon functions as an immunomodulator or a dietary fiber. Currently, chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global health problem, and there is no effective preventive treatment for CKD progression. However, paramylon may suppress the progression of CKD via the elimination of uremic toxins or modulation of gut microbiota, leading to the alleviation of inflammation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of paramylon in CKD rat model. Eight-week-old male Wistar rats with a 5/6 nephrectomy were given either a normal diet or a diet containing 5% paramylon for 8 weeks. Proteinuria was measured intermittently. Serum and kidney tissues were harvested after sacrifice. We performed a renal molecular and histopathological investigation, serum metabolome analysis, and gut microbiome analysis. The results showed that paramylon attenuated renal function, glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial injury, and podocyte injury in the CKD rat model. Renal fibrosis, tubulointerstitial inflammatory cell infiltration, and proinflammatory cytokine gene expression levels tended to be suppressed with paramylon treatment. Further, paramylon inhibited the accumulation of uremic toxins, including tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle-related metabolites and modulated a part of CKD-related gut microbiota in the CKD rat model. In conclusion, we suggest that paramylon mainly inhibited the absorption of non-microbiota-derived uremic solutes, leading to protect renal injury via anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects. Paramylon may be a novel compound that can act against CKD progression.","Nagayama, Yoshikuni; Isoo, Naoyuki; Nakashima, Ayaka; Suzuki, Kengo; Yamano, Mizuki; Nariyama, Tomoyuki; Yagame, Motoka; Matsui, Katsuyuki",PLoS One,,476

During the Covid-19 crisis, even less time is spent at the bedside, and physical examinations seem markedly truncated or non-existent. It is possible that cost of health care, doctor-patient relationships, and the clinical reasoning skills could be seriously impacted by ongoing decrease in bedside skills and the teaching of these skills. Careful history taking and hypothesis-driven physical examination still form the backbone of clinical reasoning and lead to parsimonious investigations. Overreliance on investigations could drive up costs of healthcare if every diagnosis depends on a head to toe scan. In this paper, we describe strategies for bedside teaching that are relevant and applicable even during the pandemic and an era of physical distancing. These strategies are categorised as: before, during and after patient interactions at the bedside. These strategies can be adapted to normal clinical teaching situations as well as challenging situations such as the current pandemic when physical distancing is mandated.","Dam, Marjel van; Ramani, Subha; Ten Cate, Olle",Med Teach,,476

METHODS Data from 77,075 individuals aged 20 to 59 from three steps of the EPICOVID-19 Brazil (a nationwide serological survey conducted between May and June, 2021) were assessed. The presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was examined by rapid tests. Self-reported prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, asthma, cancer, chronic kidney disease and heart disease were investigated. The prevalence of mask use, adherence to isolation measures and antibodies were evaluated separately amid carriers and non-carriers of chronic diseases. The prevalence of symptoms was analyzed among carriers and non-carriers of chronic diseases with antibodies. RESULTS The prevalence of at least one chronic disease was 43%, higher in the Southeast region, among white and indigenous individuals, women, less schooled and in lower socioeconomic position. The use of masks when leaving home was similar among carriers and non-carriers of chronic diseases (98%). The proportion of participants who reported adherence to isolation measures was higher amid carriers (15.9%) than non-carriers (24.9%) of chronic diseases. The prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 was similar amongst carriers and non-carriers (2.4% and 2.3%). The prevalence of cough, dyspnea, palpitations and myalgia was significantly higher among carriers, but the proportion of symptomatic patients was similar between groups. CONCLUSION The prevalence of chronic diseases in Brazil is high and the COVID-19 pandemic affects carriers and non-carriers of chronic diseases similarly. Carriers present more severe forms of COVID-19 and higher prevalence of symptoms. Greater adherence to social distancing measures among chronic patients is disassociated from a lower incidence of COVID-19 in this group.","Mesenburg, Marilia Arndt; Hallal, Pedro Curi; Menezes, Ana Maria Baptista; Barros, Aluísio J D; Horta, Bernardo Lessa; Barros, Fernando Celso de; Hartwig, Fernando Pires; Jacques, Nadège; Silveira, Mariangela Freitas da",Rev. saúde pública (Online),,476
363381,COVID-19 and programmatic assessment,2020,"Control of the ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic requires accurate laboratory testing to identify infected individuals while also clearing essential staff to continue to work. At the current time, a number of quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assays have been developed to identify SARS-CoV-2, targeting multiple positions in the viral genome. While the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is moderate, given the large number of transmission chains, it is prudent to monitor circulating viruses for variants that might compromise these assays. Here, we report the identification of a C-to-U transition at position 26340 of the SARS-CoV-2 genome that is associated with failure of the cobas SARS-CoV-2 E gene qRT-PCR in eight patients. As the cobas SARS-CoV-2 assay targets two positions in the genome, the individuals carrying this variant were still called SARS-CoV-2 positive. Whole-genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 showed all to carry closely related viruses. Examination of viral genomes deposited on GISAID showed this mutation has arisen independently at least four times. This work highlights the necessity of monitoring SARS-CoV-2 for the emergence of single-nucleotide polymorphisms that might adversely affect RT-PCRs used in diagnostics. Additionally, it argues that two regions in SARS-CoV-2 should be targeted to avoid false negatives.","Artesi, Maria; Bontems, Sébastien; Göbbels, Paul; Franckh, Marc; Maes, Piet; Boreux, Raphaël; Meex, Cécile; Melin, Pierrette; Hayette, Marie-Pierre; Bours, Vincent; Durkin, Keith",J. clin. microbiol,,476

363602,COVID-19 Epidemic and Its Impact on Economy and Society (preprint),2020,"In the wake of the influenza pandemic of 1889-1890 Jacques Bertillon, a pioneer of medical statistics, noticed that after the massive death spike there was a dip in birth numbers around 9 months later which was significantly larger than that which could be explained by the population change as a result of excess deaths. In addition it can be noticed that this dip was followed by a birth rebound a few months later. However having made this observation, Bertillon did not explore it further. Since that time the phenomenon was not revisited in spite of the fact that in the meanwhile there have been several new cases of massive death spikes. The aim here is to analyze these new cases to get a better understanding of this death-birth coupling phenomenon. The largest death spikes occurred in the wake of more recent influenza pandemics in 1918 and 1920, others were triggered by the 1923 earthquakes in Tokyo and the Twin Tower attack on September 11, 2001. We shall see that the first of these events indeed produced an extra dip in births whereas the 9/11 event did not. This disparity highlights the pivotal role of collateral sufferers. In the last section it is shown how the present coupling leads to predictions; it can explain in a unified way effects which so far have been studied separately, as for instance the impact on birth rates of heat waves. Thus, it appears that behind the random appearance of birth rate fluctuations there are in fact hidden explanatory factors.","Richmond, Peter; Roehner, Bertrand M.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.04533v1.pdf,476

Drawing upon media reports about children’s rainbow drawings and teddy bear hunts, in this paper, I deploy a sociological lens to demonstrate how children are using these leisure narratives as tools for participating in the wider conversation around the pandemic. At the same time, however, in pinning romanticized notions of hope and ‘national spirit’ upon the normative image of the child at play, media narratives are obfuscating the inequalities that fracture lived childhoods in the developed world.","Mukherjee, Utsa",Leis.

(Special Issue: COVID-19 and demographic impact.),2020,"Large vessel and microvascular thrombi are common complications in systemically ill horses contributing to patient morbidity and mortality. Apixaban, an oral factor Xa inhibitor, shows excellent efficacy against stroke and deep vein thrombosis in humans. The purpose of this study was to determine serum apixaban concentrations and anti-factor Xa activity in horses after orally administered apixaban. Five horses received a single dose of intravenous (0.09 mg/kg) and oral (1 mg/kg) apixaban in a cross-over design. Serum apixaban concentrations and anti-Xa activity were measured serially via liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and a commercial assay, respectively, for 12 hr following oral administration. Apixaban was detected in all horses after both oral and intravenous administration. Oral administration yielded a mean maximum concentration of 60.3 ng/ml (59.4-111 ng/ml), mean time to maximum concentration of 0.5 hr (0.5-2), mean half-life of 6.2 hr (4.6-8.3), and mean oral bioavailability of 10% (3.8-17.4). After oral administration, anti-Xa activity had a strong positive relationship with serum apixaban and was best represented by a dose-response model with the following parameters: E0 = 5.00 ng/ml, EMAX = 311 ng/mL, EC50 = 267 ng/ml, and n = 1.58. Anti-Xa activity was significantly higher 2 hr post-administration compared with baseline (p = .032). Despite low oral bioavailability, administration of 1 mg/kg oral apixaban, in healthy horses, achieves serum concentrations similar to those reported in humans. Apixaban has potential clinical utility in horses and warrants further investigation.","Wallace, Gabrielle E; McKaba, Victoria F; Reinhart, Jennifer M; Li, Zhong; Austin, Scott; Fries, Ryan C",J. vet. pharmacol. ther,,476

365756,[Eye traumatism during the COVID-19 sanitary crisis at Iota-teaching hospital],2020,"OBJECTIVE: The role of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockers during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a matter of controversies. Studies based on in-hospital exposure have suggested a beneficial effect of these drugs, unlike those based on chronic exposure. We aimed to analyse RAAS blocker prescription before and during hospital stay in patients with COVID-19, and the corresponding outcomes, to explain these discrepant results. METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study conducted in 347 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 (Bichat Hospital, Paris, France, 23 January-29 April 2020), RAAS blocker exposure, as well as timing and reason for treatment modifications, were collected. The association between exposure and mortality within 30 days of hospital admission was analysed using logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, and comorbidities. RESULTS: Median age was 61 [interquartile range, 51-72] years, 209 (60%) were male, 169 (49%) had a history of treated hypertension, and 117 (34%) received a RAAS blocker prior to hospitalization. RAAS blockers were discontinued within the first 7 days of hospital admission in 33% of previously treated patients (mostly driven by severity of the disease), with a corresponding mortality rate of 33%. Mortality was 8% when treatment was maintained or introduced, and 12% in patients never exposed. Adjusted odds ratios for association between exposure and mortality were 0.62 (95% confidence interval 0.25-1.48) based on chronic exposure and 0.25 (0.09-0.65) based on in-hospital exposure. CONCLUSION: A 'healthy user-sick stopper' bias influences RAAS blocker prescription after hospital admission for COVID-19, and explains the seemingly favourable outcome associated with in-hospital treatment.","Lahens, Alexandre; Mullaert, Jimmy; Gressens, Simon; Gault, Nathalie; Flamant, Martin; Deconinck, Laurène; Joly, Véronique; Yazdanpanah, Yazdan; Lescure, François-Xavier; Vidal-Petiot, Emmanuelle",J. hypertens,,476

With the present data brief, we will introduce researchers to the latest wave of the EVS, the implemented mode experiments, and the EVS data releases.

366179,'Establishing a Bipartisan COVID-19 Commission' [transcript],2020,"Bodies have been claimed to be an ‘absent presence’ and touch ‘risky business’ in physical education (PE). We have now witnessed how these claims are intensified in pandemic times of Covid-19, particularly in countries that have adopted extreme lockdown measures. This paper explores how PE practices have become ‘touchless’ and bodies absent using the theoretical concepts of risk and assemblage. The paper focusses on a group of pre-service PE teachers who were keen on undertaking their PE practicum experience and who were forced to switch to online mode. Data were collected through participant-produced drawings and comments on the drawings. Results suggest that the pre-service teachers are experiencing a mix of emotions during this time, miss the physical contact with students and believe the subject of PE is losing its identity as a consequence of the current situation. The conclusions of this study reveal a shift in the way that bodies are being constituted as assemblages now, and the possibility that pre-service teachers are missing out on an important aspect of their practicum experiences because of the lack of direct contact with students. We also wonder if pre-service teacher education programmes should put more emphasis on better preparing the students to teach online, and what will be the long-term consequences in the teaching of PE because of the current Covid-19 pandemic situation.","Varea, Valeria; González-Calvo, Gustavo",Sport Educ.

366284,Ohio Nonprofit COVID-19 Survey: A Report of the Results,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has altered the context for antimicrobial stewardship in primary care. AIM: To assess the effect of the pandemic on antibiotic prescribing, accounting for changes in consultations for respiratory and urinary tract infections (RTIs/UTIs). DESIGN AND SETTING: Population-based cohort study using the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) GOLD database from January 2017 to September 2020. METHOD: Interrupted time-series analysis evaluated changes in antibiotic prescribing and RTI/UTI consultations adjusting for age, sex, season, and secular trends. The authors assessed the proportion of COVID-19 episodes associated with antibiotic prescribing. RESULTS: There were 253 655 registered patients in 2017 and 232 218 in 2020, with 559 461 antibiotic prescriptions, 216 110 RTI consultations, and 36 402 UTI consultations. Compared with prepandemic months, March 2020 was associated with higher antibiotic prescribing (adjusted rate ratio [ARR] 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.11 to 1.16). Antibiotic prescribing fell below predicted rates between April and August 2020, reaching a minimum in May (ARR 0.73; 95% CI = 0.71 to 0.75). Pandemic months were associated with lower rates of RTI/UTI consultations, particularly in April for RTIs (ARR 0.23; 95% CI = 0.22 to 0.25). There were small reductions in the proportion of RTI consultations with antibiotic prescribed and no reduction for UTIs. Among 25 889 COVID-19 patients, 2942 (11%) had antibiotics within a COVID-19 episode. CONCLUSION: Pandemic months were initially associated with increased antibiotic prescribing, which then fell below expected levels during the national lockdown. Findings are reassuring that antibiotic stewardship priorities have not been neglected because of COVID-19. Research is required into the effects of reduced RTI/UTI consultations on incidence of serious bacterial infections.","Rezel-Potts, Emma; L039,; Esperance, Veline; Gulliford, Martin C",Br J Gen Pract,,476

The TCC team includes intensivists, advanced care providers, and registered nurses. Three coverage models evolved depending on onsite clinician availability. More than 133,000 patients have been served by eHospital to date, and span the typical spectrum of critical illness. Along with universal monitoring, â¼18% of patients received active interventions, the most common of which are categorized. Patterns of activity, typical workflows, and adaptations of bedside best practices are also described. Bookending the work shift are sign outs focused on pending critical issues, unstable patients, and those who can be triaged out of the intensive care unit. In between, TCC teams round periodically and interact with bedside teams. Conclusions: TCC adoption has proceeded slowly. Some acceleration is anticipated in a post-COVID-19 pandemic world. Our experience highlights operational practices that can facilitate successful TCC practice.","Canfield, Christina; Perez-Protto, Silvia; Siuba, Matthew; Hata, Steven; Udeh, Chiedozie",Telemed. j. e. health,,476
366782,Urology Residency Applications in The COVID-19 Era,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To analyse the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on a centralized specialist kidney cancer care pathway. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of patient and pathway characteristics including prioritization strategies at the Specialist Centre for Kidney Cancer located at the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust (RFH) before and during the surge of COVID-19. RESULTS: On 18 March 2020 all elective surgery was halted at RFH to redeploy resources and staff for the COVID-19 surge. Prioritizing of patients according to European Association of Urology guidance was introduced. Clinics and the specialist multidisciplinary team (SMDT) meetings were maintained with physical distancing, kidney surgery was moved to a COVID-protected site, and infection prevention measurements were enforced. During the 7 weeks of lockdown (23 March to 10 May 2020), 234 cases were discussed at the SMDT meetings, 53% compared to the 446 cases discussed in the 7 weeks pre-lockdown. The reduction in referrals was more pronounced for small and asymptomatic renal masses. Of 62 low-priority cancer patients, 27 (43.5%) were deferred. Only one (4%) COVID-19 infection occurred postoperatively, and the patient made a full recovery. No increase in clinical or pathological upstaging could be detected in patients who underwent deferred surgery compared to pre-COVID practice. CONCLUSION: The first surge of the COVID-19 pandemic severely impacted diagnosis, referral and treatment of kidney cancer at a tertiary referral centre. With a policy of prioritization and COVID-protected pathways, capacity for time-sensitive oncological interventions was maintained and no immediate clinical harm was observed.","Kuusk, Teele; Cullen, David; Neves, Joana Briosa; Campain, Nicholas; Barod, Ravi; Boleti, Ekaterini; El-Sheihk, Soha; Grant, Lee; Kelly, John; Marchetti, Marta; Mumtaz, Faiz; Patki, Prasad; Ramachandran, Navin; Silva, Pedro; Tran-Dang, My-Anh; Walkden, Miles; Tran, Maxine G B; Powles, Thomas; Bex, Axel",BJU int,,476

Aspects of global liberal arts that arise from earlier traditions within Asia are highlighted, with examples of curricula and institutions from India and China. Then a review of emerging new liberal arts programs in China, Japan, Singapore and India is presented, with details of some of the new universities and colleges being created with new curricula in Asia. The emergence of new liberal arts institutions in Europe, Africa, Vietnam and Pakistan is also reviewed, and these programs are connected both to more ancient traditions and emerging societal needs within their countries. The global interest in liberal arts is connected to the demands of the 21st century economy, and a review of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and its exponential technologies is provided and connected to new curriculum that can engage liberal arts to solve global challenges. The resulting emergence of liberal arts arises since the skills of articulate communication, deep reflection and collaboration across cultures are ever more vital in the 21st century, making global liberal arts and its deep cultural roots an ever-vital form of education to prepare students for the future. © 2021, Hiroshima University,Research Institute for Higher Education,.

367289,Can I Leave the House? A Coded Analysis of the Interpretation of the Reasonable Excuse Provision by NSW Police During the COVID-19 Lockdown,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Severe complications of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) include arterial ischemic stroke (AIS) in adults and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Whether stroke is a frequent complication of pediatric SARS-CoV-2 is unknown. This study aimed to determine the proportion of pediatric SARS-CoV-2 cases with ischemic stroke and the proportion of incident pediatric strokes with SARS-CoV-2 in the first 3 months of the pandemic in an international cohort. METHODS: We surveyed 61 international sites with pediatric stroke expertise. Survey questions included: numbers of hospitalized pediatric (&#8804; 18 years) patients with SARS-CoV-2; numbers of incident neonatal and childhood ischemic strokes; frequency of SARS-CoV-2 testing for pediatric patients with stroke; and numbers of stroke cases positive for SARS-CoV-2 from March 1 to May 31, 2020. RESULTS: Of 42 centers with SARS-CoV-2 hospitalization numbers, 8 of 971 (0.82%) pediatric patients with SARS-CoV-2 had ischemic strokes. Proportions of stroke cases positive for SARS-CoV-2 from March to May 2020 were: 1 of 108 with neonatal AIS (0.9%), 0 of 33 with neonatal cerebral sinovenous thrombosis (CSVT; 0%), 6 of 166 with childhood AIS (3.6%), and 1 of 54 with childhood CSVT (1.9%). However, only 30.5% of neonates and 60% of children with strokes were tested for SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, these proportions represent 2.9, 0, 6.1, and 3.0% of stroke cases tested for SARS-CoV-2. Seven of 8 patients with SARS-CoV-2 and stroke had additional established stroke risk factors. INTERPRETATION: As in adults, pediatric stroke is an infrequent complication of SARS-CoV-2, and SARS-CoV-2 was detected in only 4.6% of pediatric patients with ischemic stroke tested for the virus. However, < 50% of strokes were tested. To understand the role of SARS-CoV-2 in pediatric stroke better, SARS-CoV-2 testing should be considered in pediatric patients with stroke as the pandemic continues.

367775,Young adults vulnerability to COVID-19 in Brazil: an overview across the country,2021,"OBJECTIVES: In Italy, the pandemic of COVID-19 resulted in congestion of hospitals and laboratories and probably determined an underestimation of the number of infected subjects, as the molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection was mainly performed on hospitalised patients. Therefore, limited data are available about the number of asymptomatic/paucisymptomatic subjects in the general population across time. To understand SARS-CoV-2 infection in the general population, we have developed a cross-sectional study (the 'UNIversity against CORoNavirus study') to investigate infection trends in asymptomatic/paucisymptomatic subjects in Milan (Italy), between March and June 2020. PARTICIPANTS: The study population included 2023 subjects asymptomatic at the enrolment. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: A nasal mid-turbinate swab for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and blood specimen for testing serum antibodies (immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG) were collected. RESULTS: Subjects showing positivity for the SARS-CoV-2 RNA and/or for anti-SARS-CoV-2 Ig is 237 (11.7%). Only 1.2% (n=25) of the total population had a positive nasal swab for SARS-CoV-2 and the large majority (21/25) of them were observed in March. A total of 226 subjects (11%) had IgM (n=19; 0.9%), IgG (n=155; 7.7%) or both (n=52; 2.6%) against SARS-CoV-2. Subjects with a present or past SARS-CoV-2 infection did not differ from other subjects as regards the number of cohabiting family members, travels, fever and upper and lower respiratory infection episodes. CONCLUSIONS: Results from the present study support the hypothesis that the actual spread of the virus in Lombardy was underestimated in the official records. However, as it is not known how long Ig persist, numbers should be taken cautiously.","Milani, Gregorio Paolo; Rota, Federica; Favero, Chiara; Dioni, Laura; Manenti, Alessandro; Hoxha, Mirjam; Pariani, Elena; Albetti, Benedetta; Pesatori, Angela Cecilia; Montomoli, Emanuele; Bollati, Valentina",BMJ Open,,476
367906,FX markets’ reactions to COVID-19:Are they different?,2021,"The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led many countries of the world to impose a series of containment measures such as lockdowns (mass quarantines), curfews or similar restrictions (eg, stay-at-home orders, or shelter-in-place orders). All these restrictions were established in order to limit spread of COVID-19. Thus, approximately 3.9 billion people worldwide were under lockdown by early April 2020. During this time (home confinement), some solutions have been proposed by experts to improve work and school productivity, including smart working and online school lessons. However, many of the restrictive measures are likely to act as predisposing factors for dry eye disease (DED), directly or related to sick building syndrome (SBS). Herein, we discuss the implications of quarantine measures on eye health, in particular on DED associated with SBS, and introduce some potential preventive strategies for lockdown-related ocular surface disorders. Several risk factors are implicated in their pathogenesis, including environmental changes (eg, air quality) and modifications in personal behaviors (eg, the abuse of digital devices, malnutrition, and sleep/psychiatric disorders). Considering a number of predisposing factors for DED, it is possible to state that patients under lockdown are at risk of ocular surface alterations. Accordingly, the COVID-19 pandemic era is expected to determine an increase in dry eye patients all around the world (a new phenomenon that we propose to name the ""quarantine dry eye"") in the event that the restrictive measures will be recursively extended over time.","Napoli, P.

In this report, we describe LUS features of 10 consecutively admitted children with COVID-19 in two tertiary-level pediatric hospitals in Rome. LUS revealed signs of lung involvement during COVID-19 infection. In particular, vertical artifacts (70%), pleural irregularities (60%), areas of white lung (10%) and subpleural consolidations (10%) were the main findings in patients with COVID-19. No cases of pleural effusions were found. According to our experience, the routine use of LUS in the evaluation of children with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, when performed by clinicians with documented experience in LUS, was useful in diagnosing and monitoring pediatric COVID-19 pneumonia, reducing unnecessary radiation/sedation in children and exposure of health care workers to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).","Musolino, Anna Maria; Supino, Maria Chiara; Buonsenso, Danilo; Ferro, Valentina; Valentini, Piero; Magistrelli, Andrea; Lombardi, Mary Haywood; Romani, Lorenza; D039,; Argenio, Patrizia; Campana, Andrea",Ultrasound Med Biol,,476

DESIGN: Qualitative semi-structured interview study. SETTING: Participants' homes. PARTICIPANTS: Older adults living in Uganda (aged 60+). MEASUREMENTS: Older adults in Uganda were interviewed over the phone and asked about their lives before and since COVID-19, and how public health restrictions have affected their lives. Semi-structured interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and translated into English. Transcripts were thematically analyzed and themes generated in discussion. RESULTS: In total, 30 older adults participated in the study. Five themes were identified: (1) economic impacts; (2) lack of access to basic necessities; (3) impact on healthcare utilization; (4) social impacts and (5) violent reinforcement of public health restrictions. COVID-19 public health restrictions had severe impacts on their lives, with many people having not enough food to eat due to lack of income, and being unable to pay their grandchildren's school fees. Steep rises in public transport fares and an overall avoidance of transport also resulted in a lack of access to healthcare services and difficulty in getting food. Restrictions were violently reinforced by security guards. CONCLUSIONS: Public health restrictions have a severe impact not only on older adults but also on the whole family in Uganda.

There remains a gap in the prevalence literature from the perspective of direct primary care provider (PCP) reporting at a population level. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of PCP-documented vaccine and polyethylene glycol (PEG) allergy using electronic medical record data from the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study using the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network repository. Machine learning algorithms were applied to evaluate for vaccine allergy documentation, and Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical codes were used for PEG allergy or allergy to common injectable medications containing PEG (CIMCP). RESULTS: The prevalence of PCP-documented vaccine allergy in Canada was 0.037% (395/1,055,677) and of PEG allergy was 0.0009% (10/1,055,677). In total, 0.01% of patients had a documented allergy to either PEG or CIMCP (135/1,055,677). None of the patients with PEG allergy had a documented allergy to a CIMCP. Patients with vaccine allergy and PEG allergy were significantly more likely to have other atopic comorbidities, including asthma (P < .001 for both), eczema (P < .001 and P = .001, respectively), rhinitis (P = .002 and P < .001, respectively), and food allergy (P < .001 for both). Significantly higher rates of depression (P < .001 and P < .001, respectively) and anxiety (P = .003 and P < .001, respectively) were found in those with vaccine allergy, or PEG allergy, than those without vaccine allergy or PEG allergy. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to estimate the prevalence of vaccine and PEG allergy in a national cohort that uses PCP documentation, revealing a low reported rate of vaccine allergy and PEG allergy.","Abrams, Elissa M; Greenhawt, Matthew; Shaker, Marcus; Kosowan, Leanne; Singer, Alexander G",Ann. allergy asthma immunol,,476
368223,A systematic approach is needed to contain COVID-19 globally,2020,"COVID-19 is announced as a global pandemic in 2020. Its mortality and morbidity rate are rapidly increasing, with limited medications. The emergent outbreak of COVID-19 prompted by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) keeps spreading. In this infection, a patient's immune response plays pivotal role in the pathogenesis. This inflammatory factor was shown by its mediators that, in severe cases, reach the cytokine at peaks. Hyperinflammatory state may sparks significant imbalances in transporters and drug metabolic machinery, and subsequent alteration of drug pharmacokinetics may result in unexpected therapeutic response. The present scenario has accounted for the requirement for therapeutic opportunities to relive and overcome this pandemic. Despite the diminishing developments of COVID-19, there is no drug still approved to have significant effects with no side effect on the treatment for COVID-19 patients. Based on the evidence, many antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs have been authorized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat the COVID-19 patients even though not knowing the possible drug-drug interactions (DDI). Remdesivir, favipiravir, and molnupiravir are deemed the most hopeful antiviral agents by improving infected patient's health. Dexamethasone is the first known steroid medicine that saved the lives of seriously ill patients. Some oligopeptides and proteins have also been using. The current review summarizes medication updates to treat COVID-19 patients in an inflammatory state and their interaction with drug transporters and drug-metabolizing enzymes. It gives an opinion on the potential DDI that may permit the individualization of these drugs, thereby enhancing the safety and efficacy.","Kumar, Devendra; Trivedi, Neerja",Biomed Pharmacother,,476

No standards exist to characterize shock-absorbing healthcare flooring. This study explores two mechanical tests for impact force reduction and horizontal force required to move wheeled objects. An appropriately designed rubber underlay can reduce peak impact by 25% compared with 1% with standard vinyl. INTRODUCTION: Severe falls often occur in hospitals and care homes. Shock-absorbing flooring is one potential solution to prevent fall-related injuries; however, no standards exist for characterizing flooring as an injury prevention measure. Shock-absorbing flooring use in high-risk settings may influence both patients (injury-saving potential) and staff (manoeuvring equipment). We aimed to explore two tests to characterize floors, to determine shock absorbency and horizontal pulling force required to move wheeled objects. METHODS: Mechanical testing was performed according to the Canadian Standards Association Z325 Hip Protectors document. This test was developed for hip protectors but is applicable to compliant surfaces that form part of the floor. Tests were performed on commercially available floor materials (suitable for care settings) to assess the force required to initiate movement of a wheeled object across the floor. We explored the relationships between horizontal force required to pull wheeled objects, impact force, floor thickness, and core material. RESULTS: Considerable differences were identified between floor samples in their ability to reduce the peak impact force (range 0.7-25%). A peak force reduction of up to 25% can be achieved with a specially designed rubber underlay. Horizontal pulling force increased with floor thickness but was lower for rubber floors. There was no direct relationship between impact attenuation and horizontal pulling force. Whilst thickness and core material explain some variations (66.5% for wheel movement; 82.3% for impact), other unmeasured factors clearly influence floor performance. CONCLUSIONS: These results can inform the development of flooring and the establishment of standards needed to underpin practice, research, and development in this field.","Keenan, B E; Hallas, K; Drahota, A K; Evans, S L",Osteoporosis int,,476

We aimed to identify the pattern of substance use among high school students and its relationship with psychosocial factors. STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. METHODS: The study was conducted in Oct 2019 among students in the senior secondary school in Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti State; southwestern Nigeria. Participants were selected using random sampling, and data were collected using a socio-demographic questionnaire, the Kessler Psychological distress scale and an adapted version of the NIDA-Modified ASSIST. Bivariate analysis and multiple logistic regression were carried out to identify factors associated with psychological distress. RESULTS: Overall, 682 students participated in the study. The lifetime and current prevalence of any substance were 17.3% (95% CI: 14.7%, 20.5%) and 11.7% (95% CI: 9.0, 14.0), respectively. Although most substance use variables increases the risk of psychological distress, history of lifetime substance use AOR= 3.03 (95% CI: 1.19, 7.72, P=0.020) and absence of direct parental care AOR=2.04 (1.19, 3.48, P=0.009) significantly increases the risk of experiencing psychological distress. Parental substance use AOR=3.48 (95% CI: 1.57, 7.69, P=0.002), male gender AOR=2.97 (95% CI: 1.82, 4.83, P=0.001) significantly increased substance use risk while having married parents AOR=0.50 (95% CI: 0.27, 0.92, P=0.027) and living with parents AOR 0.39 (95% CI: 0.20, 0.75, P=0.005) were significant protective factors. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of substance use among these adolescents was substantial. Drug education initiated in primary school and services aimed at promoting the mental wellbeing of adolescents may go a long way in decreasing substance use among this population.","Obadeji, Adetunji; Kumolalo, Banji F; Oluwole, Lateef O; Ajiboye, Adedotun S; Dada, Mobolaji U; Ebeyi, Rose Chidindu",J Res Health Sci,,476

The workshop organizers chose cardiovascular disease (CVD) as an example health outcome for which cumulative risk considerations could illuminate environmental and health management strategies. To guide discussions, we developed a series of conceptual models illustrating factors influencing CVD. The CVD conceptual model represents complex processes across varying space and time scales, different causal pathways, and multiple chemical and non-chemical stressors and factors. It includes causal influences of environmental exposures and lifestyle choices, in the context of genetics and medical factors. The representation of cumulative risk as a network of interrelated nodes and arrows helps define and organize the problem and available information, determine the scope and scale, and creates a platform for analysis. It provides an interface for discussing how different entities (e.g., environmental versus health-driven organizations) can work together on different parts of the problem, and facilitates relative risk ranking and management triage. Color coding is used to distinguish categories of stressors and possible oversight responsibility. This work informs guidelines for CRA planning and assessment of factor combinations affecting real-world risk.","Kashuba, R.; Menzie, C.; Martin, L.",Human and Ecological Risk Assessment,,476

METHODS: Single-center retrospective cohort study of adult HCT recipients with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. RESULTS: Twenty-eight consecutive transplantation and cellular therapy patients (autologous, n = 12; allogeneic, n = 15; chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy [CAR-T], n = 1) with COVID-19 were identified. The median age was 57 years. The median time from HCT to COVID-19 diagnosis was 656 days (interquartile range [IQR], 33-1274). Patients were followed for a median of 59 days (IQR, 40-88). Among assessable patients (n = 19), 10 (53%) had documented virological clearance; median time to clearance was 34 days (range, 21-56). Out of 28, 12 (43%), 6 (21%), and 10 (36%) patients had mild, moderate, and severe/critical disease, respectively. Overall mortality was 25%, nearly identical for autologous and allogeneic HCT, and exclusively seen in hospitalized patients, older than 50 years of age with severe COVID-19. None of the patients with mild (n = 12) or moderate (n = 6) COVID-19 died whereas 7/10 patients (70%) with severe/critical COVID-19 died (P = .0001). Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 within 12 months of HCT exhibited higher mortality (57% vs 14%; P = .04). All-cause 30-day mortality (n = 4) was 14%. A higher proportion of patients who died within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis (3/4) were receiving &#8805;2 immunosuppressants, compared with patients who survived beyond 30 days after COVID-19 diagnosis (2/24; 75% vs. 8%; P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: Mortality in COVID-19 HCT patients is higher than that of the age-comparable general population and largely dependent on age, disease severity, timing from HCT, and intensity of immunosuppression.","Camargo, Jose F; Mendoza, Maria A; Lin, Rick; Moroz, Ilona V; Anderson, Anthony D; Morris, Michelle I; Natori, Yoichiro; Natori, Akina; Raja, Mohammed; Lekakis, Lazaros; Beitinjaneh, Amer; Jimenez, Antonio; Goodman, Mark; Wang, Trent; Komanduri, Krishna V; Pereira, Denise",Transpl Infect Dis,,476

The study included 202 participants divided into two groups, one consisting of 133 patients with canal paresis CP > 19% and one of 69 healthy subjects. Participant was tested according to the standard protocol of static posturography (SP), and with head movements of 0.3 Hz (HS 40), 0.6 Hz (HS 70) in random order controlled by a metronome. HS-posturography revealed a similar repeatability and internal consistency as the standard posturography. In patients with UV, 4th condition revealed higher sensitivity (74%) and specificity (71%) in HS 40 than in the standard posturography (67%, 65% respectively) and HS 70 (54%, 70% respectively). Static posturography and HS- posturography revealed a high reliability of the testing method. The head movements added to static posturography improve the sensitivity and specificity of the method in group with vestibular impairment. The most important test for that purpose seems to be the one on unstable surface with the eyes closed, with low frequency of head movements.","Janc, Magdalena; Sliwinska-Kowalska, Mariola; Politanski, Piotr; Kaminski, Marek; Jozefowicz-Korczynska, Magdalena; Zamyslowska-Szmytke, Ewa",Sci Rep,,476

Confinement-induced decreases in physical activity levels and increases in sedentary behavior may provoke a rapid deterioration of cardiovascular health and premature deaths among populations with increased cardiovascular risk. Even short-term (1-4 wk) inactivity has been linked with detrimental effects in cardiovascular function and structure and increased cardiovascular risk factors. In this unprecedented and critical scenario, home-based physical activity programs arise as a clinically relevant intervention to promote health benefits to cardiac patients. Many studies have demonstrated the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of different models of home-based exercise programs in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases and major cardiovascular events among different populations. This body of knowledge can inform evidence-based policies to be urgently implemented to counteract the impact of increased physical inactivity and sedentary behavior during the COVID-19 outbreak, thereby alleviating the global burden of cardiovascular disease.","Peçanha, Tiago; Goessler, Karla Fabiana; Roschel, Hamilton; Gualano, Bruno",,,476

371033,Elderly people and responses to COVID-19 in 27 Countries,2020,"The duration of infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) in living patients has been demarcated. In contrast, a possible SARS-CoV-2 infectivity of corpses and subsequently its duration under post mortem circumstances remain to be elucidated. The aim of this study was to investigate the infectivity and its duration of deceased COVID-19 (coronavirus disease) patients. Four SARS-CoV-2 infected deceased patients were subjected to medicolegal autopsy. Post mortem intervals (PMI) of 1, 4, 9 and 17 days, respectively, were documented. During autopsy, swabs and organ samples were taken and examined by RT-qPCR (real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA). Determination of infectivity was performed by means of virus isolation in cell culture. In two cases, virus isolation was successful for swabs and tissue samples of the respiratory tract (PMI 4 and 17 days). The two infectious cases showed a shorter duration of COVID-19 until death than the two non-infectious cases (2 and 11 days, respectively, compared to > 19 days), which correlates with studies of living patients, in which infectivity could be narrowed to about 6 days before to 12 days after symptom onset. Most notably, infectivity was still present in one of the COVID-19 corpses after a post-mortem interval of 17 days and despite already visible signs of decomposition. To prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections in all professional groups involved in the handling and examination of COVID-19 corpses, adequate personal safety standards (reducing or avoiding aerosol formation and wearing FFP3 [filtering face piece class 3] masks) have to be enforced for routine procedures.","Plenzig, Stefanie; Bojkova, D; Held, H; Berger, A; Holz, F; Cinatl, J; Gradhand, E; Kettner, M; Pfeiffer, A; Verhoff, M A; Ciesek, S",Int. j. legal med,,476
371383,SIED Newsletter,2020,"Objective: Invasive candidiasis (IC), a life-threatening fungal infection prevalent among hospitalized patients, has highly variable regional epidemiology. We conducted a multicenter surveillance study to investigate recent trends in species distribution and antifungal susceptibility patterns among IC-associated Candida spp. in Beijing, China, from 2016 to 2017. Materials and Methods: A total of 1496 non-duplicate Candida isolates, recovered from blood and other sterile body fluids of IC patients, were identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry combined with ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region sequencing. Broth microdilution-based susceptibility testing using six antifungal agents was also conducted. Results: Candida albicans was the most frequently isolated species (49.9%), followed by Candida tropicalis (15.5%), Candida glabrata (14.7%) and Candida parapsilosis (14.2%). No significant differences in species distribution were observed when compared with a 2012-2013 dataset. Overall, the rates of susceptibility to fluconazole and voriconazole were high among C. albicans (98% and 97.2%, respectively) and C. parapsilosis species complex (91.1% and 92%, respectively) isolates but low among C. tropicalis (81.5% and 81.1%, respectively) isolates. In addition, the rate of azole resistance among C. tropicalis isolates increased significantly (1.8-fold, P<0.05) compared with that observed in 2012-2013, while micafungin resistance rates were <5% for all tested Candida species. Conclusion: Our results suggest that species distribution has remained stable among IC-associated Candida isolates in Beijing. Resistance to micafungin was rare, but increased azole resistance among C. tropicalis isolates was noted. Our study provides information on local epidemiology that will be important for the selection of empirical antifungal agents and contributes to global assessments of antifungal resistance.","Guo, Li-Na; Yu, Shu-Ying; Xiao, Meng; Yang, Chun-Xia; Bao, Chun-Mei; Yu, Yan-Hua; Ye, Li-Yan; Yang, Yang; Zhang, Ge; Liu, Jie; Liang, Guo-Wei; Min, Rong; Zhu, Yu; Lei, Hong; Liu, Yu-Lei; Liu, Lin-Juan; Hu, Yun-Jian; Hsueh, Po-Ren; Xu, Ying-Chun",Infect Drug Resist,,476

METHODS: In total, 348 CT scans in 112 patients were classified according to the time after the onset of the initial symptoms, namely stage-1 (0-4 days); stage-2 (5-9 days); stage-3 (10-14 days); stage-4 (15-21 days); stage-5 (22-28 days); and stage-6 (ï¼28 days). Each lung lobe was evaluated for extent affected by ground-glass opacities (GGO), crazy-paving pattern and consolidation, in five categories of percentual severity. Summation of scores from all five lung lobes provided the total CT score (maximal CT score, 25). RESULTS: The predominant patterns of lung abnormalities were GGOs, crazy-paving pattern, consolidation and linear opacities. The frequency of crazy-paving pattern, consolidation and linear opacities peaked at stage-3 (62.7 %), stage-4 (75.0 %) and stage-5 (83.1 %), respectively, and decreased thereafter. Total CT scores increased from stage-1 to stage-2 (2.8 ± 3.1, vs. 6.5 ± 4.6, respectively, P < 0.01), and thereafter remained high. The lower lobes were more inclined to be involved with higher CT scores except for stage-1. At stage-6 98.1 % of CT scans still showed abnormalities (CT score 7.5 ± 4.1). CONCLUSION: Thin-section CT could provide semi-quantitative analysis of pulmonary damage severity. This disease changed rapidly at the early stage, then tended to be stable and lasted for a long time.","Ding, Xun; Xu, Jia; Zhou, Jun; Long, Qingyun",Eur J Radiol,,476

The CNS involvement of the virus is not trivial; although the brain has highly protective systems, the virus has ways to breach them with a destructive potential. For successful entry of the virus, different possible routes with favorable mechanisms are used. The SARS-CoV-2 invasion induces a mechanism of both the innate and adaptive immune response to control virus replication and removal from the CNS tissues. The cytokine storm and autoimmune response during the immunological events result in demyelination, damage of resident cells and neurons, cerebrovascular thrombosis, and dysregulation of neuro signaling pathways. Furthermore, hypoxia and toxemia accelerate the neurological destruction process. The acute attributions on psychology due to inflammation is a hallmark of CNS involved pathogenesis; nevertheless, the productivity, durability, and longevity of virus-specific lymphocytes are the vital indicators for complete removal of viral antigen and in combat against reinfection of the CNS.

Importantly, weak interactions that are often invisible to other biophysical methods can also be probed. Methodological advancements in NMR have enabled the investigation of high molecular weight, homo-oligomeric complexes that bind multiple ligand molecules, with increasing numbers of studies of the structural dynamics and binding properties of these systems. It therefore becomes of interest to consider how binding and kinetics parameters can be extracted from experiments on these more complicated molecules. Here we present the theoretical framework for analyzing binding reactions of homo-oligomeric complexes by NMR, taking into account all of the chemical species in solution and their corresponding NMR observables. A number of simulations are presented to illustrate the utility of the derived expressions.","Harkness, Robert W; Toyama, Yuki; Kay, Lewis E",J Magn Reson,,476

The precipitous drop in patient volumes and sequestering of faculty and trainees to maintain social distancing affects experiential learning. The shift of nearly all teaching settings to a virtual environment has been challenging but may also allow more interaction during teaching sessions than traditional readout sessions or didactic lectures. Faculty development is key in ensuring competence and confidence in this new environment. Recruitment of trainees using a virtual platform will require communication of opportunities as well as the culture of the department and institution as well as the community. Delay of the board examinations has caused angst as well as disruption of the timing of clinical rotations but may ultimately result in a shift of how the examinations are administered.

376603,Vitrectomy as an Aerosol-Generating Procedure in the Time of COVID-19 The VAPOR Study,2021,"On February 27, 2020, the Santa Clara County Public Health Department (SCCPHD) identified its first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) associated with probable community transmission (i.e., infection among persons without a known exposure by travel or close contact with a patient with confirmed COVID-19). At the time the investigation began, testing guidance recommended focusing on persons with clinical findings of lower respiratory illness and travel to an affected area or an epidemiologic link to a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 case, or on persons hospitalized for severe respiratory disease and no alternative diagnosis (1). To rapidly understand the extent of COVID-19 in the community, SCCPHD, the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), and CDC began sentinel surveillance in Santa Clara County. During March 5-14, 2020, four urgent care centers in Santa Clara County participated as sentinel sites. For this investigation, county residents evaluated for respiratory symptoms (e.g., fever, cough, or shortness of breath) who had no known risk for COVID-19 were identified at participating urgent care centers. A convenience sample of specimens that tested negative for influenza virus was tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Among 226 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 23% had positive test results for influenza. Among patients who had negative test results for influenza, 79 specimens were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and 11% had evidence of infection. This sentinel surveillance system helped confirm community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Santa Clara County. As a result of these data and an increasing number of cases with no known source of transmission, the county initiated a series of community mitigation strategies. Detection of community transmission is critical for informing response activities, including testing criteria, quarantine guidance, investigation protocols, and community mitigation measures (2). Sentinel surveillance in outpatient settings and emergency departments, implemented together with hospital-based surveillance, mortality surveillance, and serologic surveys, can provide a robust approach to monitor the epidemiology of COVID-19.","Zwald, Marissa L; Lin, Wen; Sondermeyer Cooksey, Gail L; Weiss, Charles; Suarez, Angela; Fischer, Marc; Bonin, Brandon J; Jain, Seema; Langley, Gayle E; Park, Benjamin J; Moulia, Danielle; Benedict, Rory; Nguyen, Nang; Han, George S",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,476

377190,COVID-19: A Framework for Effective Delivering of Online Classes During Lockdown,2021,"The spread of COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has been growing since its first identification in December 2019. The publishing of the first SARS-CoV-2 genome made a valuable source of data to study the details about its phylogeny, evolution, and interaction with the host. Protein-protein binding assays have confirmed that Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is more likely to be the cell receptor through which the virus invades the host cell. In the present work, we provide an insight into the interaction of the viral spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) from different coronavirus isolates with host ACE2 protein. By calculating the binding energy score between RBD and ACE2, we highlighted the putative jump in the affinity from a progenitor form of SARS-CoV-2 to the current virus responsible for COVID-19 outbreak. Our result was consistent with previously reported phylogenetic analysis and corroborates the opinion that the interface segment of the spike protein RBD might be acquired by SARS-CoV-2 via a complex evolutionary process rather than a progressive accumulation of mutations. We also highlighted the relevance of Q493 and P499 amino acid residues of SARS-CoV-2 RBD for binding to human ACE2 and maintaining the stability of the interface. Moreover, we show from the structural analysis that it is unlikely for the interface residues to be the result of genetic engineering. Finally, we studied the impact of eight different variants located at the interaction surface of ACE2, on the complex formation with SARS-CoV-2 RBD. We found that none of them is likely to disrupt the interaction with the viral RBD of SARS-CoV-2.","Othman, Houcemeddine; Bouslama, Zied; Brandenburg, Jean-Tristan; da Rocha, Jorge; Hamdi, Yosr; Ghedira, Kais; Srairi-Abid, Najet; Hazelhurst, Scott",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,,476

Methods: The participants (weighted n = 206, age 65-94) for the current study were selected from a nationally representative online survey of US adults from April 10-20, 2020. We used multiple linear regression to estimate the relative contribution of the four RAA global constructs (instrumental attitude, injunctive norms, descriptive norms, and self-efficacy) in explaining intention to stay home after controlling for demographic covariates. We also conducted a content analysis to identify beliefs about advantages, disadvantages, and facilitators of staying home. Results: After controlling for demographic characteristics, injunctive norms (b = 0.208; SE = 0.059; B = 0.213, p < 0.01) and self-efficacy (b = 0.532; SE = 0.058; B = 0.537, p < 0.001) showed statistically significant independent associations with intention to stay home. The specific beliefs underlying the decision to stay home spanned across health and wellness dimensions and suggested interpersonal, mental health, and leisure/recreational facilitators. Conclusions: These findings suggest three public health intervention targets. First, self-efficacy building interventions could enhance older adults' perceptions of their ability to stay home to avoid unnecessary exposures. Second, health communication messages to address injunctive norms could emphasize that people important to older adults think they should stay home. Third, for the youngest of the older adults, health communication messages could emphasize the advantages of staying home.","Macy, Jonathan T; Owens, Christopher; Mullis, Kristina; Middlestadt, Susan E",Front Public Health,,476

METHODS: All PD patients who had undergone QSM MRI for presurgical deep brain stimulation (DBS) planning were eligible for inclusion in this study. The entire STN and its three functional subdivisions, as well as the adjacent white matter (WM), were segmented and measured. The QSM value difference between the entire STN and adjacent WM (STN-WM), between the limbic and associative regions of the STN (L-A), and between the associative and motor regions of the STN (A-M) were obtained as measures of gradient and were input into an unsupervised k-means clustering algorithm to automatically categorize the overall boundary distinctness between the STN and adjacent WM and between STN subdivisions (gradient blur [GB] and gradient sharp [GS] groups). Statistical tests were performed to compare clinical and image measurements for discrimination between GB and GS groups. RESULTS: Of the 39 study patients, 19 were categorized into the GB group and 20 into the GS group, based on quantitative cluster analysis. The GB group had a significantly higher presurgical off-medication Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III score (51.289 ± 20.741) than the GS group (38.5 ± 16.028; p = 0.037). The GB group had significantly higher QSM values for the STN and its three subdivisions and adjacent WM than those for the GS group (p < 0.01). The GB group also demonstrated a significantly higher STN-WM gradient in the right STN (p = 0.01). The GB group demonstrated a significantly lower L-A gradient in both the left and the right STN (p < 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Advancing PD with more severe motor impairment leads to more iron deposition in the STN and adjacent WM, as shown in the QSM signal. Loss of the STN inner QSM signal gradient should be considered as an image marker for more severe motor impairment in PD patients.","Huang, Weiyuan; Ogbuji, Richard; Zhou, Liangdong; Guo, Lingfei; Wang, Yi; Kopell, Brian H",J Neurosurg,,476

We aimed to evaluate the ability of the C-reactive protein (CRP) to predict COVID-19 infection outcome. This retrospective study was conducted on 429 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between March 30, 2020, and April 30, 2020. The study population was divided into severe (n = 175) and nonsevere cases (n = 254). Data on demographic characteristics, clinical features, and laboratory findings on admission were collected. The proportion of patients with increased CRP levels was significantly higher in severe cases than in nonsevere patients. Analysis of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve found that CRP could be used as an independent factor in predicting the severity of COVID-19. Also, patients with CRP &gt;64.75 mg/L were more likely to have severe complications. In conclusion, CRP serum levels can predict the severity and progression of illness in patients with COVID-19.","Sadeghi-Haddad-Zavareh, M.; Bayani, M.; Shokri, M.; Ebrahimpour, S.; Babazadeh, A.; Mehraeen, R.; Moudi, E.; Rostami, A.; Barary, M.; Hosseini, A.; Bijani, A.; Javanian, M.",Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Infectious Diseases,,476

The prevalence of disease has been primarily identified from retrospective studies using standard-of-care specimens. The incidence of both asymptomatic respiratory viral detection and symptomatic respiratory viral detection in this high-risk population is not well described. We performed longitudinal, active, prospective surveillance in pediatric HCT patients. Subjects underwent weekly midturbinate swabs (MTSs) for the detection of 18 respiratory viruses and subtypes peri-HCT and 100 days post-HCT. Clinical data were obtained from the medical record. From September 2015 to February 2017, 24 children underwent 29 HCT, and 284 MTSs were collected. Forty-two (15%) specimens were virus-positive from 10 (42%) subjects. Specimens from children undergoing allogeneic HCT were more likely to have a virus detected (17% vs 8%, P = .04) compared with specimens from children undergoing autologous HCT. Sixteen (38%) detections were not associated with symptoms. Almost half (8/17) of the unique viral infections occurred during the HCT hospitalization after a negative specimen, suggesting nosocomial acquisition, and preceded detection from a clinical specimen. Rhinovirus, the most common virus detected, was the only virus detected in 33 (81%) virus-positive specimens; only 11 (33%) rhinovirus detections were asymptomatic. Asymptomatic detection of coronavirus and bocavirus occurred. Asymptomatic respiratory virus detection occurred in more than one-third of the children undergoing HCT. The acquisition of respiratory viruses during HCT hospitalization suggests nosocomial acquisition. Early detection of respiratory viruses during asymptomatic periods could have infection prevention and treatment implications.","Schuster, Jennifer E; Banerjee, Dithi; Ahmed, Ibrahim; Selvarangan, Rangaraj",Pediatr Transplant,,476

However, data are limited on the factors associated with neonatal clinical or viral testing outcomes. Objective: To ascertain the percentage of neonates who were born to mothers with positive SARS-CoV-2 test results during the birth hospitalization, the clinical and sociodemographic factors associated with neonatal test result positivity, and the clinical and virological outcomes for newborns during hospitalization and 30 days after discharge. Design, Setting, and Participants: This multicenter cohort study included 11 academic or community hospitals in Massachusetts and mother-neonate dyads whose delivery and discharge occurred between March 1, 2020, and July 31, 2020. Eligible dyads were identified at each participating hospital through local COVID-19 surveillance and infection control systems. Neonates were born to mothers with positive SARS-CoV-2 test results within 14 days before to 72 hours after delivery, and neonates were followed up for 30 days after birth hospital discharge. Exposures: Hypothesized maternal risk factors in neonatal test result positivity included maternal COVID-19 symptoms, vaginal delivery, rooming-in practice, Black race or Hispanic ethnicity, and zip code-derived social vulnerability index. Delivery indicated by worsening maternal COVID-19 symptoms was hypothesized to increase the risk of adverse neonatal health outcomes. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes for neonates were (1) positive SARS-CoV-2 test results, (2) indicators of adverse health, and (3) clinical signs and viral testing. Test result positivity was defined as at least 1 positive result on a specimen obtained by nasopharyngeal swab using a polymerase chain reaction-based method. Clinical and testing data were obtained from electronic medical records of nonroutine health care visits within 30 days after hospital discharge. Results: The cohort included 255 neonates (mean [SD] gestational age at birth, 37.9 [2.6] weeks; 62 [24.3%] with low birth weight or preterm delivery) with 250 mothers (mean [SD] age, 30.4 [6.3] years; 121 [48.4%] were of Hispanic ethnicity). Of the 255 neonates who were born to mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 225 (88.2%) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and 5 (2.2%) had positive results during the birth hospitalization. High maternal social vulnerability was associated with higher likelihood of neonatal test result positivity (adjusted odds ratio, 4.95; 95% CI, 1.53-16.01; P = .008), adjusted for maternal COVID-19 symptoms, delivery mode, and rooming-in practice. Adverse outcomes during hospitalization were associated with preterm delivery indicated by worsening maternal COVID-19 symptoms. Of the 151 newborns with follow-up data, 28 had nonroutine clinical visits, 7 underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing, and 1 had a positive result. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings emphasize the importance of both biological and social factors in perinatal SARS-CoV-2 infection outcomes. Newborns exposed to SARS-CoV-2 were at risk for both direct and indirect adverse health outcomes, supporting efforts of ongoing surveillance of the virus and long-term follow-up.","Angelidou, Asimenia; Sullivan, Katherine; Melvin, Patrice R; Shui, Jessica E; Goldfarb, Ilona Telefus; Bartolome, Ruby; Chaudhary, Neha; Vaidya, Ruben; Culic, Ivana; Singh, Rachana; Yanni, Diana; Patrizi, Silvia; Hudak, Mark L; Parker, Margaret G; Belfort, Mandy B",JAMA Netw Open,,476

Aims: We aimed to examine the impact of COVID-19 on suicide risk by sampling Chinese Weibo users and analyzing their social media messages. Method: We predicted the probability of suicide (including hopelessness, suicidal ideation, negative self-evaluation, and hostility) of Weibo users in order to assess the changes in suicide probability at different times. Repeated-measures ANOVA was performed to examine the differences in suicide probability in different regions during different periods. Results: There was no significant difference in suicide probability between profoundly infected areas (PIAs) and less infected areas (LIAs) before the outbreak of COVID-19. LIAs had an increase in hopelessness during the COVID-19 growth period, while hopelessness and hostility in PIA increased during the COVID-19 decline period, indicating potential suicide probability. Limitations: Results should be interpreted with caution, and cross-cultural research may be considered in the future. Conclusion: COVID-19 has a dynamic impact on suicide probability. Using data from online social networks may help to understand the impact pattern of COVID-19 on people's suicide probability.","Li, Sijia; Xue, Jia; Liu, Xiaoqian; Wu, Peijing; Liu, Tianli; Zhu, Meng; Zhao, Nan; Zhu, Tingshao",Crisis,,476

377963,Optimal COVID-19 Containment Strategies: Evidence Across Multiple Mathematical Models (preprint),2021,"RATIONALE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global threat to health. Its inflammatory characteristics are incompletely understood. OBJECTIVES: To define the cytokine profile of COVID-19, and to identify evidence of immunometabolic alterations in those with severe illness. METHODS: Levels of interleukin (IL)-1ß, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and soluble TNF receptor 1 (sTNFR1) were assessed in plasma from healthy volunteers, hospitalized-but-stable COVID-19 patients (COVIDstable), COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission (COVIDICU) and individuals with severe community-acquired pneumonia requiring ICU support (CAPICU). Immunometabolic markers were measured in circulating neutrophils from patients with severe COVID-19. The acute phase response of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) to COVID-19 was also evaluated. MAIN RESULTS: IL-1ß, IL-6, IL-8 and sTNFR1 were all increased in patients with COVID-19. COVIDICU patients could be clearly differentiated from COVIDstable, and demonstrated higher levels of IL-1ß, IL-6 and sTNFR1 - but lower IL-10 - than CAPICU. COVID-19 neutrophils displayed altered immunometabolism, with increased cytosolic PKM2, phosphorylated PKM2, HIF-1&#945; and lactate. The production and sialylation of AAT increased in COVID-19, but this anti-inflammatory response was overwhelmed in severe illness, with the IL-6:AAT ratio markedly higher in patients requiring ICU admission (P<0.0001). In critically unwell COVID-19 patients, increases in IL-6:AAT predicted prolonged ICU stay and mortality, while improvement in IL-6:AAT was associated with clinical resolution (P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 cytokinemia is distinct from that of other types of pneumonia leading to organ failure and ICU need. Neutrophils undergo immunometabolic reprogramming in severe COVID-19 illness. Cytokine ratios may predict outcomes in this population.

Methods: A cross-sectional on-line survey was distributed to employees of a major health care institution located in São Paulo, Brazil between April 3 and April 10, 2020. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: The sample comprised 2,646 respondents. Most participants (44.4%) reported excessive or almost excessive access to information about the novel coronavirus and 67.6% reported having increased their average time spent on social media. When asked how frequently they consider it was easy to determine the reliability of information, ""sometimes"" corresponded to 43.2% of the answers in contrast to 14.6% responding ""always"". Answers related to potential signs of information overload associated with the pandemic indicated that 31% of respondents felt stressed by the amount of information they had to keep up with almost every day or always. Overall, 80.0% of respondents reported having experienced at least one of the following symptoms: headache, eye twitching, restlessness or sleeping difficulty. The frequency of symptoms was higher among participants with a more negative information processing style regarding when dealing with large volumes of information relative to those with a positive information processing style. Likewise, symptoms were more frequently reported by participants who had increased their social media access relative to those reporting reduced access during the pandemic. Conclusion: Our survey provides a description of how health professionals consume COVID-19 related information during the pandemic, and suggests that excessive information exposure and high processing demands may impose psychological distress and affect mental health.","Bazán, Paulo Rodrigo; Azevedo Neto, Raymundo Machado de; Dias, Julia Abou; Salvatierra, Vanessa Gil; Sanches, Liana Guerra; Lacerda, Shirley Silva; Amaro Junior, Edson; Kozasa, Elisa Harumi; Balardin, Joana Bisol",Einstein (Säo Paulo),,476

Both the natural course of the disease and the treatment drugs used have effects on ventricular repolarization. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of repolarization parameters obtained from surface electrocardiography (ECG) on prognosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Participants were 205 consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 diagnosis. The 12-lead surface ECG was obtained from each patient on admission. The ECG results were evaluated against the patients' clinical characteristics and outcomes by experienced cardiology specialists. RESULTS: The mean age was higher in the non-survivor group compared to the survivor group (57.4 +/- 15.7 vs. 65.6 +/- 16.6;p = 0.001). The demographical characteristics were similar between the survivor and non-survivor groups. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that age (OR: 1.041;p = 0.009), D-dimer (OR: 1.002;p = 0.031), high-sensitivity troponin I (hs-TnI) (OR: 1.010;p = 0.041), pneumonia on computed tomography (CT) (OR: 4.985;p &lt; 0.001), the peak-to-end interval of the T wave (Tp-e) (OR: 3.421;p &lt; 0.001), and Tp-e/QTc ratio (OR: 1.978;p = 0.013) were statistically significant independent predictors in terms of determining mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged Tp-e interval and increased Tp-e/QTc ratio on admission are decent predictors and linked with mortality. ECG is a practical study to evaluate prognosis and potential arrhythmias, as well as initiating suitable treatment.","Sit, O.; Oksen, D.; Atici, A.; Barman, H. A.; Alici, G.; Pala, A. S.; Tekin, E.

Therefore, dramatic changes in their institutional context have led to increasing competition in the drugs retail sector and a shift toward a service-oriented business. These factors urge rethinking of the business model of these hybrid organizations, which combine a profit-oriented, social, and more recently addressed, environmental identity. This paper aims at discussing a sustainable business model (SBM) that could allow community pharmacies to contribute to public health through pharmacists' current role and development of that role. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic suggest that human health should be at the center of the sustainable development agenda;the pandemic raises questions about the traditional role of community pharmacies, such as extending patient-oriented services. The SBM for community pharmacies represents an opportunity to enhance their role among the healthcare workforce, especially in a time of global pandemics. In addition, the SBM can support community pharmacies to integrate sustainability in day-to-day pharmacy practice, although it should be customized based on the contextual characteristics of the business and on differences between countries, such as health policies and regulations.","Cavicchi, C.; Vagnoni, E.",Sustainability,,476

380770,The ROX index has greater predictive validity than NEWS2 for deterioration in Covid-19,2021,"Rationale:Patients with COVID-19 frequently develop severe respiratory disease and may require invasive mechanical ventilation. A study of primarily white patients intubated for COVID-19 associated respiratory failure found predictors of 28-day mortality to be respiratory system compliance, age, tidal volume, arterial pH and heart rate. Little is known about the outcomes of minority populations with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Therefore, we present an analysis of the predictors of mortality in a group of primarily African American patients with COVID-19 associated respiratory failure. Methods:All adult patients admitted to the University of Chicago COVID-19 intensive care unit receiving invasive mechanical ventilation between March 1st and June 31st, 2020 were identified. Patients were included in the study if they had at least one recorded measure of plateau airway pressure while receiving volume-controlled ventilation allowing determination of driving pressure and lung compliance. Univariable analysis was conducted comparing survivors with those who died in-hospital followed by construction of a multivariable logistic regression model predicting in-hospital mortality based on significant factors from univariable analysis, excluding colinear variables. Results:Eighty-five patients were included in this retrospective study. Patients were primarily African American (n=73, 86%). Among all study patients, median tidal volume was 6.0 cc/kg ideal body weight (IQR 5.8-6.2), PEEP was 8 cm H2O (IQR 5.0-10), and driving pressure was 14 cm H2O (IQR 11-16). Median respiratory system compliance was 27 ml/cm H2O (IQR 21-34). Salvage therapies for refractory hypoxemia in the cohort included prone positioning (27%), paralysis (27%), inhaled pulmonary vasodilators (19%), and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (1%). In the multivariable logistic regression model, age (OR 1.077, 95% CI 1.031 to 1.125, p=0.001) and driving pressure (OR 1.174, 95% CI 1.009 to 1.366, p=0.038) were found to be independent predictors of mortality. Conclusions:In a predominantly African American patient population with COVID-19 pneumonia requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, higher driving pressure was predictive of overall mortality. These finding are consistent with the work of Botta et al (2020), who demonstrated reduced lung compliance was predictive of mortality among a largely white group of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. While minority populations infected with COVID-19 have been found worse outcomes, early lung mechanics appear to be comparable to white patients. These findings support that higher driving pressures and low lung compliance are indicative of serious lung injury which may lead to death.","Stutz, M. R.; Pearson, S.

An online socio-demographic characteristics questionnaire, General Health Questionnaire (GHQ -28), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) were utilized to evaluate psychosocial status. According to GHQ, the psychological disorders of the HCWs were significantly higher than that of the general population (P < 0.001). According to GAD-7, no significant difference was found between general population and HCWs. Multivariate logistic analysis showed no difference between general population and HCWs in the psychological disorder. Although HCWs suffered from psychological disorders more than general population, nearly one third to half of the participants in both groups had psychosocial disorders.","Zakeri, Mohammad Ali; Hossini Rafsanjanipoor, Sayed Mortaza; Sedri, Nadia; Kahnooji, Mahmood; Sanji Rafsanjani, Mojtaba; Zakeri, Maryam; Zakeri Bazmandeh, Abbas; Talebi, Ali; Dehghan, Mahlagha",Curr Psychol,,476

382899,Generic probabilistic modelling and non-homogeneity issues for the UK epidemic of COVID-19,2020-04-04,"BACKGROUND: There is a real possibility of successive COVID-19-epidemic waves with devastating consequences. In this context, it has become mandatory to design age-selective measures aimed at achieving an optimal balance between protecting public health and maintaining a viable economic activity. METHODS: We programmed a Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Removed (SEIR) model in order to introduce epidemiologically relevant age classes into the outbreak-dynamics analysis. The model was fitted to the official death toll and calculated age distribution of deaths in Wuhan using a constrained linear least-squares algorithm. Subsequently, we used synthetic location-specific and age-structured contact matrices to quantify the effect of age-selective interventions both on mortality and on economic activity in Wuhan. For this purpose, we simulated four different scenarios ranging from an absence of measures to age-selective interventions with stronger physical-distancing measures for older individuals. RESULTS: An age-selective strategy could reduce the death toll by >30% compared with the non-selective measures applied during Wuhan's lockdown for the same workforce. Moreover, an alternative age-selective strategy could allow a 5-fold increase in the population working on site without a detrimental impact on the death toll compared with the Wuhan scenario. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that age-selective-distancing measures focused on the older population could have achieved a better balance between COVID-19 mortality and economic activity during the first COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan. However, the implications of this need to be interpreted along with considerations of the practical feasibility and potential wider benefits and drawbacks of such a strategy.","Ortega-Quijano, Daniel; Ortega-Quijano, Noe",Int. j. epidemiol,,476

DESIGN: Prospective observational cohort study with rapid data gathering and near real time analysis. SETTING: 260 hospitals in England, Wales, and Scotland between 17 January and 3 July 2020, with a minimum follow-up time of two weeks (to 17 July 2020). PARTICIPANTS: 651 children and young people aged less than 19 years admitted to 138 hospitals and enrolled into the International Severe Acute Respiratory and emergency Infections Consortium (ISARIC) WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK study with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Admission to critical care (high dependency or intensive care), in-hospital mortality, or meeting the WHO preliminary case definition for MIS-C. RESULTS: Median age was 4.6 (interquartile range 0.3-13.7) years, 35% (225/651) were under 12 months old, and 56% (367/650) were male. 57% (330/576) were white, 12% (67/576) South Asian, and 10% (56/576) black. 42% (276/651) had at least one recorded comorbidity. A systemic mucocutaneous-enteric cluster of symptoms was identified, which encompassed the symptoms for the WHO MIS-C criteria. 18% (116/632) of children were admitted to critical care. On multivariable analysis, this was associated with age under 1 month (odds ratio 3.21, 95% confidence interval 1.36 to 7.66; P=0.008), age 10-14 years (3.23, 1.55 to 6.99; P=0.002), and black ethnicity (2.82, 1.41 to 5.57; P=0.003). Six (1%) of 627 patients died in hospital, all of whom had profound comorbidity. 11% (52/456) met the WHO MIS-C criteria, with the first patient developing symptoms in mid-March. Children meeting MIS-C criteria were older (median age 10.7 (8.3-14.1) v 1.6 (0.2-12.9) years; P<0.001) and more likely to be of non-white ethnicity (64% (29/45) v 42% (148/355); P=0.004). Children with MIS-C were five times more likely to be admitted to critical care (73% (38/52) v 15% (62/404); P<0.001). In addition to the WHO criteria, children with MIS-C were more likely to present with fatigue (51% (24/47) v 28% (86/302); P=0.004), headache (34% (16/47) v 10% (26/263); P<0.001), myalgia (34% (15/44) v 8% (21/270); P<0.001), sore throat (30% (14/47) v (12% (34/284); P=0.003), and lymphadenopathy (20% (9/46) v 3% (10/318); P<0.001) and to have a platelet count of less than 150 × 109/L (32% (16/50) v 11% (38/348); P<0.001) than children who did not have MIS-C. No deaths occurred in the MIS-C group. CONCLUSIONS: Children and young people have less severe acute covid-19 than adults. A systemic mucocutaneous-enteric symptom cluster was also identified in acute cases that shares features with MIS-C. This study provides additional evidence for refining the WHO MIS-C preliminary case definition. Children meeting the MIS-C criteria have different demographic and clinical features depending on whether they have acute SARS-CoV-2 infection (polymerase chain reaction positive) or are post-acute (antibody positive).

METHODS: The authors invited licensed US dentists practicing primarily in private practice or public health to participate in a web-based survey in June 2020. Dentists from every US state (n = 2,195) answered questions about COVID-19-associated symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 infection, mental and physical health conditions, and infection control procedures used in their primary dental practices. RESULTS: Most of the dentists (82.2%) were asymptomatic for 1 month before administration of the survey; 16.6% reported being tested for SARS-CoV-2; and 3.7%, 2.7%, and 0% tested positive via respiratory, blood, and salivary samples, respectively. Among those not tested, 0.3% received a probable COVID-19 diagnosis from a physician. In all, 20 of the 2,195 respondents had been infected with SARS-CoV-2; weighted according to age and location to approximate all US dentists, 0.9% (95% confidence interval, 0.5 to 1.5) had confirmed or probable COVID-19. Dentists reported symptoms of depression (8.6%) and anxiety (19.5%). Enhanced infection control procedures were implemented in 99.7% of dentists' primary practices, most commonly disinfection, COVID-19 screening, social distancing, and wearing face masks. Most practicing dentists (72.8%) used personal protective equipment according to interim guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 prevalence and testing positivity rates were low among practicing US dentists. This indicates that the current infection control recommendations may be sufficient to prevent infection in dental settings. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Dentists have enhanced their infection control practices in response to COVID-19 and may benefit from greater availability of personal protective equipment.

384106,COVID-19 and the British Overseas Territories: a comparative view,2021,"BACKGROUND The damage caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been extensive. Pregnant women are a group requiring special attention in medicine given the anatomical and physiological changes that occur during pregnancy. Skin rash is commonly associated with pregnancy, with the most common form of an erythematous maculopapular rash being pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy. Skin rash is also an increasingly reported initial presentation in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), due to infection with SARS-CoV-2. CASE REPORT A 34-year-old woman with a diamniotic dichorionic twin pregnancy presented with clinical picture characterized by dermatological manifestations, namely an erythematous and papular skin rash associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. A real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (GeneFinder) test was positive for SARS-CoV-2 detection. CONCLUSIONS Ten months after the onset of this pandemic, there is no conclusive evidence indicating that pregnant women represent a sector more or less vulnerable to severe forms of COVID-19 than the general population. This report has highlighted the importance of performing a reliable diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients who present with a skin rash, particularly pregnant women.","Oropeza Chávez, Liliana; Sánchez Tinajero, Ángel; Martínez Orozco, José Arturo; Becerril Vargas, Eduardo; Dolores De la Merced, Alfredo; Ruíz Santillán, Danna Patricia; Delgado Cueva, Andrea Iraís; Alvarado Peña, Nestor",Am J Case Rep,,476

This paper presents two case examples of visual ergonomics assessments conducted virtually: one for a large office where there were reports of reflected glare on computer displays, and another for a self-employed worker who experienced headaches associated with the lighting in her home office. In both cases it was not possible to conduct an onsite assessment due to COVID-19 travel restrictions. The cases demonstrate that virtual visual ergonomics assessments can be successful (1) if a triage is conducted prior to the assessment to confirm that the strategy is suitable, and (2) if there is good collaboration between the ergonomist and the worker during the assessment. A virtual assessment may also confer considerable financial savings to the workplace. In the case examples presented in this paper it was possible to observe the nature of the presenting problem and provide advice to mitigate the issue.

385155,ICT Keeping COVID-19-Hit Economy Afloat and Spearheading Recovery [Mobile Radio],2021,"Despite the social disparities in COVID-19 infection, little is known about factors influencing social disparities in preventive behaviors during the pandemic. This study examined how educational disparities in mask-wearing, handwashing, and limiting public outings might be contingent upon three factors: contextual cue of danger, perceived risk of local outbreak, and interventional context with different levels of intensity (i.e, Wuhan vs. other areas). Data were obtained from a telephone survey of 3327 adults, who were recruited through a random-digit-dial method to be representative of all cell phone users in China. Interviews were conducted from 28 April to 26 May 2020. Stratified multiple regression models showed that educational disparities in all three behaviors were only consistently observed among people exposed to context cues of danger, with an enhanced sense of risk of a local outbreak, or in areas other than Wuhan. College education seems to make a difference in handwashing regardless of contextual cues of danger or perception of risk. The findings suggested that, in the process of an epidemic, emerging threats in one's immediate environment or raised awareness of risks are important conditions triggering educational disparities in prevention. However, effective public health interventions could potentially reduce such disparities.","Li, Miao; Wang, Weidong",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,476
385178,Erratum to: COVID-19 epidemic: disentangling the re-emerging controversy about medical facemasks from an epidemiological perspective,2020,"PURPOSE: Nurses have an increased risk for acquiring COVID-19 infection. This study assessed levels of risk for exposure to COVID-19 among nurses, and determined those at the greatest risk. DESIGN: A cross-sectional design was used to assess risk for exposure to COVID-19 in nurses from five randomly selected governmental hospitals in the United Arab Emirates. Participants completed an online survey (including the World Health Organization survey) to assess their risk for exposure to COVID-19. Descriptive statistics were used to describe classes of risk for exposure, and logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with greater risk. FINDINGS: Of the 552 participants, 284 nurses (51.4%) were classified at high risk for COVID-19 exposure as they did not report adherence to infection control and prevention (ICP) guidelines at all times during healthcare interactions and when performing aerosol procedures, or had accidental exposure to biological fluid and respiratory secretions. Compared with adherence to wearing medical masks, gloves, and hand hygiene practices, adherence to wearing face shields or goggles and disposable gowns and decontaminating high-touch surfaces was less frequent. Shifting to work in critical care units, not having adequate critical care experience, and reporting a need for training in ICP practices were factors that contributed to high-risk exposure (p values for Ex (Bs) = 2.60, 2.16, 1.75, &#8804; 0.05, consecutively). CONCLUSIONS: A considerable number of nurses were classified at high risk for COVID-19 exposure. Critical care work experience and adequate evidence-based training in ICP practices related to COVID-19 must be considered to mitigate the risk for exposure to COVID-19 in nurses. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study provided a strong message regarding protecting nurses at high risk for exposure to COVID-19. Clinical leaders must stay vigilant to ensure nurses' adherence to ICP practices in the context of COVID-19, and to proactively address any related deficits.","Bani-Issa, Wegdan A; Al Nusair, Hussam; Altamimi, Abdalrahman; Hatahet, Sarah; Deyab, Firas; Fakhry, Randa; Saqan, Roba; Ahmad, Salwa; Almazem, Fathia",J. nurs. scholarsh,,476

Methods: An online questionnaire was administered on some pages of the nursing social networks and addressed precisely to nurses directly involved in the care of patients affected by Covid-19 in two different periods of the pandemic: during the first wave (March2020 - May 2020) and during the second wave (October 2020 - November 2020). Results: A total of 592 nurses agreed to participate in the study: 291 nurses during the first wave and 301 during the second wave. No significant differences were recorded among the two groups based on anxiety disorder (p=. 364). A significant difference between the two groups were recorded considering the depression and the insomnia condition, too (p &lt;.001;p&lt;.001). Additionally, no significant differences were recorded between the two waves, both for the anxiety, depression and insomnia disorders. In fact, there were only sex-related differences for each wave, but between the two waves the condition among nurses did not vary significantly.

The authors looked at the 100 fastest growing companies from 1999 to 2017 and then the Persistent 32 from 2018 to 2020 Second, what happened to the investments and performance of the Persistent 32 during the pandemic and recession that began in the first quarter of 2020? Where did they invest or curtail investment, what plans did they make around COVID-19 and what headcount decisions did they make? Third, do growth-committed firms follow different investment strategies that can be categorized based on spending patterns? Practical implications: Companies that can survive and grow through the hardest of times have lessons to teach, although there is no silver bullet or secret formula, even within the same industry Social implications: Employee retention during a recession has been a familiar strategy for the top growers covered in this investigation throughout the period (1999–2020) This strategy is not generally common among US firms Indeed, it says something about the growth prospects of these firms and their dependence on talent and need to leverage their prior investment in recruiting and training employees Originality/value: What is important about this topic?

Because the specialty of our laboratory is experimental biophysics, careful planning was necessary for the continuation of research. We set several special research topics for teleworking, although some compromise was inevitable. Frequent meetings, seminars, and lectures using the Zoom meeting system were important to maintain laboratory activity. Meetings were carried out three times per day. Two types of seminars were held, as well as the “meeting-style” laboratory. Lectures by outsiders were also performed. As a result of these approaches, many students succeeded in presenting their telework research in autumn domestic conferences for biophysics and physics education in 2020. Furthermore, some students submitted papers to academic research journals by the end of the teleworking period.

The present study explores the potential association between serum nitrate levels and mortality in COVID-19 patients. DESIGN: A prospective observation study was carried out. SETTING: Eight Intensive Care Units (ICUs) from 6 hospitals in the Canary Islands (Spain). PATIENTS: COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU. INTERVENTIONS: Determination of serum nitrate levels at ICU admission. MAIN VARIABLE OF INTEREST: Mortality at 30 days. RESULTS: Non-surviving (n=11) compared to surviving patients (n=42) showed higher APACHE-II (p<0.001) and SOFA scores (p=0.004), and higher serum nitrate levels (p=0.001). Logistic regression analyses showed serum nitrate levels to be associated to 30-day mortality after controlling for SOFA (OR=1.021; 95%CI=1.006-1.036; p=0.01) or APACHE-II (OR=1.023; 95%CI=1.006-1.041; p=0.01). There were no differences in the area under the curve (AUC) for mortality prediction by serum nitrate levels (AUC=83%; 95%CI=73-92%; p<0.001), APACHE II (AUC=85%; 95%CI=75-96%; p<0.001) and SOFA (AUC=78%; 95%CI=63-92%; p=0.005) based on the DeLong method. The Kaplan-Meier analysis found patients with serum nitrates levels>68.4µmol/l to have a higher mortality rate (hazard ratio=138.8; 95%CI=22.3-863.9; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The main novel finding was the association between serum nitrate levels and mortality in COVID-19 patients controlling for the SOFA or APACHE-II scores, though larger studies are needed to confirm this observation.","Lorente, L; Gómez-Bernal, F; Martín, M M; Navarro-Gonzálvez, J A; Argueso, M; Perez, A; Ramos-Gómez, L; Solé-Violán, J; Marcos Y Ramos, J A; Ojeda, N; Jiménez, A","Med. intensiva (Madr., Ed. impr.)",,476

386721,Pythagorean m-polar fuzzy topology with TOPSIS approach in exploring most effectual method for curing from COVID-19,2020,"Dear Editor, The Covid-19 pandemic affected human life globally, inducing much stress on daily living (Cakiroglu et al. 2020). Although assessments of general mental health during the Covid-19 pandemic have been widely reported, there is not adequate research on how schizophrenia patients have been affected. According to the World Health Organization (2020), individuals with chronic diseases who do not pay attention to their personal hygiene and the rules of protection from COVID-19 have a higher risk of getting infected than the healthy individuals who observe these measures. It is well known that the risk of Covid-19 infection is raised among schizophrenia patients due to negligence on the requisite control of personal hygiene and health conditions related to smoking and diabetes ( Cohn et al., 2004;Dinan et al., 2004;Krieger et al. 2019). The cognitive impairment in this disorder which reduces the perceptions on the necessity of self protection and the awareness of the risks proposed to underlie this raised risk of COVID-19 positivity (Yao et al. 2020). These patients have difficulty in following the preventive regulations (Palomar-Ciria et al., 2020). Apart from the risk of infection, there is also the risk of pandemic related development of auditory or visual hallucinations and delusional symptoms by acute and chronic psychosis patients during and after the pandemic (Brown et al. 2020, Cowan 2020). Therefore, this survey has been organised to evaluate the reaction developed by schizophrenia patients to the pandemic conditions. The first Covid-19 case was reported in Turkey on 11 March 2020 (Anadolu Agency, 11.03.2020) which was followed by the gradual increase in case numbers. In order to prevent the spread of Covid-19 and maintain the existing public health, the Republic of Turkey Ministry of Health established a 'Scientific Committee'' and prepared effective strategies including social isolation, quarantine, school closures, social distancing and wearing face mask in the community. During this process, the approximately 250 schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder patients followed up by the Psychosis Outpatient Unit of Dokuz Eylul University Hospital Psychiatry Department (DEUPD) were instructed to visit the outpatient unit only in emergency conditions. It was determined that there were 176 schizophrenia patients whose follow up visit appointments for the period of April 1 - June 22, 2020, scheduled before the announcement of the pandemic, were cancelled. Therefore, the survey reported here was conducted with the schizophrenia patients of the DEUPD online and by telephone connections during 10- 20 May, 2020, the 9th and the 10th weeks of the pandemic. Only 76 (43.19%) of the 176 patients joined the survey, since 4 (2.27%) refused to participate and 96 (54.4%) could not be contacted. The survey aimed to determine the incidence of Covid-19 diagnosis among these schizophrenia patients and their attitude to the preventive measures against the infection during the first 2 months of the pandemic, together with how they felt and their needs for psychiatric consultation on outpatient basis during this period. The surveyed 76 patients consisted of 49 (64%) males and 27 (35%) females, with 73 (96.1%) dwelling in urban and 3 (3.9%) in suburban areas;and only 11 (14.5%) employed while 65 (85.5%) were not working. Only two patients reported consulting emergency services for Covid-19 symptoms. The rest of the patients did not report consulting a healthcare facility for suspecting Covid-19 symptoms or Table 1.

The physical parameters (temperature and turbidity) of water were measured and the measured data collected are able to be viewed and monitored on the mobile phone using Kolora Mobile Application via Wi-Fi connection. Therefore, this surface water quality device has potential to be applied in real time monitoring for early pollution detection and during COVID-19 pandemic spread due to limited movement.","Hakimi, I.

Here, we present a streamlined workflow-COVseq-which can be used to generate highly multiplexed sequencing libraries compatible with Illumina platforms from hundreds of SARS-CoV-2 samples in parallel, in a rapid and cost-effective manner. We benchmark COVseq against a standard library preparation method (NEBNext) on 29 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples, reaching 95.4% of concordance between single-nucleotide variants detected by both methods. Application of COVseq to 245 additional SARS-CoV-2 positive samples demonstrates the ability of the method to reliably detect emergent VOC as well as its compatibility with downstream phylogenetic analyses. A cost analysis shows that COVseq could be used to sequence thousands of samples at less than 15 USD per sample, including library preparation and sequencing costs. We conclude that COVseq is a versatile and scalable method that is immediately applicable for SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance and easily adaptable to other pathogens such as influenza viruses.","Simonetti, Michele; Zhang, Ning; Harbers, Luuk; Milia, Maria Grazia; Brossa, Silvia; Huong Nguyen, Thi Thu; Cerutti, Francesco; Berrino, Enrico; Sapino, Anna; Bienko, Magda; Sottile, Antonino; Ghisetti, Valeria; Crosetto, Nicola",Nat Commun,,476

This emerging virus presents particular hazards to researchers and laboratory staff in a clinical setting, highlighted by rapid and widespread global transmission. Based on the epidemiological and clinical data that have become available in mid-2020, we propose the interim classification of SARS-CoV-2 as a Risk Group 3 organism is reasonable, and discuss establishing Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) regulations accordingly. Despite its global spread, the reported mortality rate of SARS-CoV-2 ranging from 0.13% to 6.22% is considerably less than that of other Risk Group 4 agents including Ebola and Marburg viruses with fatality rates as high as 90%. In addition, studies have demonstrated that approximately 86% of patients presenting with severe courses of the disease are aged 70 years or above, with the presence of comorbid conditions such as cardiovascular and respiratory system diseases in the majority of all fatal cases. In contrary to recent discussions surrounding the protective and administrative measures needed in a laboratory, the emerging evidence surrounding mortality rate, distinct demographics of severe infections, and the presence of underlying diseases does not justify the categorisation of SARS-CoV-2 as a Risk Group 4 organism. This article summarises biosafety precautions, control measures and appropriate physical containment facilities required to minimise the risk of laboratory-acquired infections with SARS-CoV-2.","Kaufer, Alexa M; Theis, Torsten; Lau, Katherine A; Gray, Joanna L; Rawlinson, William D",Pathology,,476
388460,Pandemics and citizen perceptions about their country: Did COVID-19 increase national pride in South Korea?,2021,"Hemorrhagic cholecystitis is a rare end-stage manifestation of acalculous cholecystitis that is associated with high mortality. The hematological sequelae of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) are complex and are associated with increased incidence of both thromboembolic and hemorrhagic events. Our patient is a 69-yearold male with hypertension and gout who was admitted to the medical intensive care unit with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and lactic acidosis. The patient was treated with a therapeutic low-intensity heparin infusion per institutional COVID-19 anticoagulation protocol based on elevated D-dimer (15,217 ng/mL). Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis on hospital day 1 and day 4 were negative for acute pathology. On hospital day 9, the patient developed shock and acute blood loss, and repeat CT of the abdomen showed new hemorrhagic cholecystitis. Heparin infusion was stopped, and acute care surgery consultants recommended against emergent surgery given the patient's hemodynamic instability. The patient was stabilized with blood product resuscitation and antibiotics. Laparoscopy prior to discharge showed heavy intra-abdominal adhesions with friable tissue, and the cholecystectomy attempt was aborted. He was discharged and was seen in clinic for follow-up, where he reported no abdominal pain and good functional status. Systemic coagulation dysfunction related to COVID-19 presents significant challenges to clinicians balancing the competing risks of acute thrombosis and bleeding. Hemorrhagic cholecystitis is a very uncommon complication of gallbladder disease, and reports linked to active COVID-19 are even more scarce. The gallbladder contains a particularly high expression of angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). This pattern is known to be vital for the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to enter cells, but direct end-organ damage from the virus outside of the respiratory system remains an active area of research. Our patient did not have radiographic gallbladder disease present on admission, but decompensated as a result of hemorrhage early in his COVID-19 course. Here, we present an unusual manifestation of a rare disease, with spontaneous hemorrhagic cholecystitis occurring a patient with severe COVID-19.","Kramer, P. J.; Sediqe, S. A.; Giddings, O.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether ocular surface cells possess the key factors required for cellular susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 entry/infection. METHODS: We analyzed human post-mortem eyes as well as surgical specimens for the expression of ACE2 (the receptor for SARS-CoV-2) and TMPRSS2, a cell surface-associated protease that facilitates viral entry following binding of the viral spike protein to ACE2. RESULTS: Across all eye specimens, immunohistochemical analysis revealed expression of ACE2 in the conjunctiva, limbus, and cornea, with especially prominent staining in the superficial conjunctival and corneal epithelial surface. Surgical conjunctival specimens also showed expression of ACE2 in the conjunctival epithelium, especially prominent in the superficial epithelium, as well as weak or focal expression in the substantia propria. All eye and conjunctival specimens also expressed TMPRSS2. Finally, Western blot analysis of protein lysates from human corneal epithelium obtained during refractive surgery confirmed expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these results suggest that ocular surface cells including conjunctiva are susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2, and could therefore serve as a portal of entry as well as a reservoir for person-to-person transmission of this virus. This highlights the importance of safety practices including face masks and ocular contact precautions in preventing the spread of COVID-19 disease.","Zhou, Lingli; Xu, Zhenhua; Castiglione, Gianni M; Soiberman, Uri S; Eberhart, Charles G; Duh, Elia J",Ocul Surf,,476

Here, we describe a digital warm-start CRISPR (dWS-CRISPR) assay for sensitive quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples. The dWS-CRISPR assay is initiated at above 50 °C and overcomes undesired premature target amplification at room temperature, enabling accurate and reliable digital quantification of SARS-CoV-2. By targeting SARS-CoV-2's nucleoprotein gene, the dWS-CRISPR assay is able to detect down to 5 copies/µl SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the chip. It is clinically validated by quantitatively determining 32 clinical swab samples and three clinical saliva samples. Moreover, it has been demonstrated to directly detect SARS-CoV-2 in heat-treated saliva samples without RNA extraction. Thus, the dWS-CRISPR method, as a sensitive and reliable CRISPR assay, facilitates accurate SARS-CoV-2 detection toward digitized quantification.","Ding, Xiong; Yin, Kun; Li, Ziyue; Sfeir, Maroun M; Liu, Changchun",Biosens Bioelectron,,476

To that effect, this article presents some socio-ethical reflections underscoring the judicious use of the insight from care ethics as an asset in minimizing the possible propagation of the COVID-19 virus and the escalation of its vulnerability in the day-to-day human interaction.

390146,Modelling the impacts of lockdown and isolation on the eradication of COVID-19,2020,"Early warning is a vital component of emergency repsonse systems for infectious diseases. However, most early warning systems are centralized and isolated, thus there are potential risks of single evidence bias and decision-making errors. In this paper, we tackle this issue via proposing a novel framework of collaborative early warning for COVID-19 based on blockchain and smart contracts, aiming to crowdsource early warning tasks to distributed channels including medical institutions, social organinzations, and even individuals. Our framework supports two surveillance modes, namely, medical federation surveillance based on federated learning and social collaboration surveillance based on the learning markets approach, and fuses their monitoring results on emerging cases to alert. By using our framework, medical institutions are expected to obtain better federated surveillance models with privacy protection, and social participants without mutual trusts can also share verified surveillance resources such as data and models, and fuse their surveillance solutions. We implemented our proposed framework based on the Ethereum and IPFS platforms. Experimental results show that our framework has advantages of decentralized decision-making, fairness, auditability, and universality, and also has potential guidance and reference value for the early warning and prevention of unknown infectious diseases.","Ouyang, Liwei; Yuan, Yong; Cao, Yumeng; Wang, Fei-Yue",Information sciences,,476

However, these are even more important for them to adhere to due to their increased levels of vulnerability, particularly to COVID-19. With a lack of previous evidence, we explored the understanding and changes in adherence to COVID-19 public health restrictions over time in people living with dementia (PLWD). METHODS: Unpaid carers and PLWD were interviewed over the phone in April 2020, shortly after the nationwide UK lockdown, with a proportion followed up from 24th June to 10th July. Participants were recruited via social care and third sector organisations across the UK, and via social media. FINDINGS: A total of 70 interviews (50 baseline, 20 follow-up) were completed with unpaid carers and PLWD. Five themes emerged: Confusion and limited comprehension; Frustration and burden; Putting oneself in danger; Adherence to restrictions in wider society; (Un) changed perceptions. Most carers reported limited to no understanding of the public health measures in PLWD, causing distress and frustration for both the carer and the PLWD. Due to the lack of understanding, some PLWD put themselves in dangerous situations without adhering to the restrictions. PLWD with cognitive capacity who participated understood the measures and adhered to these. DISCUSSION: In light of the new second wave of the pandemic, public health measures need to be simpler for PLWD to avoid unwilful non-adherence. Society also needs to be more adaptive to the needs of people with cognitive disabilities more widely, as blanket rules cause distress to the lives of those affected by dementia.","Giebel, Clarissa; Hanna, Kerry; Rajagopal, Manoj; Komuravelli, Aravind; Cannon, Jacqueline; Shenton, Justine; Eley, Ruth; Gaughan, Anna; Callaghan, Steve; Tetlow, Hilary; Limbert, Stan; Whittington, Rosie; Rogers, Carol; Ward, Kym; Shaw, Lisa; Butchard, Sarah; Gabbay, Mark",BMC Public Health,,476

The aim of this study was to explore the impact of these changes on Neonatal Nurses globally. Methods: We conducted a thematic analysis on written reflections by neonatal nurses worldwide, exploring their experiences of COVID-19. Twenty-two reflections were analysed from eleven countries. Results: Thematic analysis revealed 4 main themes relating to the nurses' role: 1) protector 2) challenges to human quality of care 3) vulnerability and 4) resilience. The measures taken as protector were described as compromising the human qualities of care fundamental to their role. This tension, together with other new challenges, heightened feelings of vulnerability. Concurrently, nurses identified role resilience, including resourcefulness and peer support, which allowed them to navigate the global pandemic. Conclusion: By identifying global challenges and strategies to overcome these, neonatal nurses may be better equipped as the pandemic continues. The reflections underscore the importance of family integrated care and the tension created when it is compromised.","Shaw, Chloe; Gallagher, Katie; Petty, Julia; Mancini, Alexandra; Boyle, Breidge",Journal of neonatal nursing,,476

393553,"Hazard Pay for COVID-19? Yes, But It's Not a Substitute for a Living Wage and Enforceable Worker Protections",2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused significant disruption in medical education. With disruption comes the opportunity for innovation. Telehealth had been growing rapidly in many fields of medicine prior to the pandemic, however, the necessities of social distancing, scarcity of personal protective equipment, and mandates to prevent unnecessary exposures for healthcare workers and patients alike, brought opportunities for the exponential expansion of telehealth. With expansion of telehealth services came the need to expand curriculum in telehealth to prepare medical students to return to vastly transformed clinical settings as well as prepare them for a future clinical landscape likely to incorporate telehealth to a much greater degree. The University of Colorado School of Medicine (CUSOM) rapidly developed a course in telehealth to prepare students for this changing clinical environment. Simultaneously, a faculty development curriculum was created to support clinical faculty new to telehealth in basic skills and teaching in a virtual environment. Lastly, adaptations were made to the summative Clinical Practice Exam administered to students at the completion of clerkships to incorporate telehealth. Recognizing the importance of achieving competence in telehealth, the CUSOM has taken steps to invest in the development of comprehensive and integrated telehealth curricula. Many creative and innovative solutions have been adopted in the wake of this pandemic to allow medical education to continue despite many hurdles and barriers; many of these will not persist past the pandemic. However, we expect telehealth clinical skills and the curricula developed to support them to remain relevant long past the time when the COVID-19 pandemic has faded into history.","Adams, Jennifer E; Ecker, David J",,,476

METHODS: Data contained the daily reports publicized by the MPH. The formulations were carried out under the Conditioned Probability modality applying Bayes' Theorem. All the COVID-19 tests applied in relation to the confirmed cases per million inhabitants were considered to obtain their level of positivity, and compared with the experience of Iceland and South Korea. RESULTS: The probability of detecting positive cases of COVID-19 in Ecuador was higher than Iceland and South Korea, because the diagnostic tests were aimed at symptomatic patients, without identifying asymptomatic or mild symptomatic, who play an important role in the transmission of the disease. In addition, many symptomatic patients were examined but will remain undiagnosed due to the unavailability of tests and the low quality of many of them. CONCLUSIONS: The daily reports on the behavior of the COVID-19 issued by the Ecuadorian government do not adequately represent the growth in the number of those infected each day, nor the actual behavior of the epidemic, affecting possible control measures.","Cañizares Fuentes, Ricardo; Aroca, Rubén; Blasco Carlos, Miquel",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,476

395972,"Ageismus, věkové rozdělení a zkušenost stáří v době krize: Zamyšlení nad společenskými dopady pandemie COVID-19 *",2021,"BACKGROUND: The newly emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a worldwide pandemic of human respiratory disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 is the key receptor on lung epithelial cells to facilitate initial binding and infection of SARS-CoV-2. The binding to ACE2 is mediated via the spike glycoprotein present on the viral surface. Recent clinical data have demonstrated that patients with previous episodes of brain injuries are a high-risk group for SARS-CoV-2 infection. An explanation for this finding is currently lacking. Sterile tissue injuries including stroke induce the release of several inflammatory mediators that might modulate the expression levels of signaling proteins in distant organs. Whether systemic inflammation following brain injury can specifically modulate ACE2 expression in different vital tissues has not been investigated. METHODS: For the induction of brain stroke, mice were subjected to a surgical procedure for transient interruption of blood flow in the middle cerebral artery for 45 min and sacrificed after 1 and 3 days for analysis of brain, lung, heart, and kidney tissues. Gene expression and protein levels of ACE2, ACE, IL-6 and IL1ß were measured by quantitative PCR and Western blot, respectively. The level of soluble ACE2 in plasma and bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL) was measured using an immunoassay. Immune cell populations in lymphoid organs were analyzed by flow cytometry. Post-stroke pneumonia in mice was examined by bacterial cultures from lung homogenates and whole blood. RESULTS: Strikingly, 1 day after surgery, we observed a substantial increase in the protein levels of ACE2 in the lungs of stroke mice compared to sham-operated mice. However, the protein levels of ACE2 were found unchanged in the heart, kidney, and brain of these animals. In addition, we found increased transcriptional levels of alveolar ACE2 after stroke. The increased expression of ACE2 was significantly associated with the severity of behavioral deficits after stroke. The higher protein levels of alveolar ACE2 persisted until 3 days of stroke. Interestingly, we found reduced levels of soluble ACE2 in plasma but not in BAL in stroke-operated mice compared to sham mice. Furthermore, stroke-induced parenchymal and systemic inflammation was evident with the increased expression of IL-6 and IL-1ß. Reduced numbers of T-lymphocytes were present in the blood and spleen as an indicator of sterile tissue injury-induced immunosuppression. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate specific augmented alveolar ACE2 levels and inflammation in murine lungs after experimental stroke. These pre-clinical findings suggest that patients with brain injuries may have increased binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2 in their lungs which might explain why stroke is a risk factor for higher susceptibility to develop COVID-19.","Singh, Vikramjeet; Beer, Alexander; Kraus, Andreas; Mang, Felix; Zhang, Xiaoni; Xue, Jinhua; Hagemann, Nina; Hermann, Dirk M; Gunzer, Matthias",Brain Behav Immun,,476
396023,Urgent Symposium: Engineering Education in the Era of COVID-19,2020,"Introduction: Anaplasma phagocytophilum causes human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA). We present a case of ARDS due to HGA, highlighting the importance of maintaining a broad differential and thorough history taking even in the midst of a pandemic. Case: A 43 year-old man with a history of alcohol and tobacco use presented in late November 2020 in the midst of a regional COVID-19 surge with two weeks of progressive shortness of breath, chest pain, fevers, and altered mental status. Admission labs were notable for hepatocellular injury, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia with absolute lymphopenia, and elevated creatinine. The patient's hypoxemia progressed to the point of requiring mechanical ventilation despite broad spectrum antibiotics. SARS-CoV-2 PCR x3, blood, viral, and fungal cultures were negative. Patient's PaO2/FiO2 ratio of &lt;200, extensive bilateral infiltrates, and low suspicion for heart failure was consistent with ARDS (Figure). Given continued hypoxia, the patient underwent the prone positioning protocol. A peripheral smear was obtained for thrombocytopenia/leukopenia and demonstrated inclusions within the neutrophils consistent with Anaplasma. Upon further history taking, the spouse confirmed that the patient had recently found several ticks on his body after returning from a hunting trip in northern Minnesota. Anaplasma was confirmed with PCR testing. The rarity of ARDS due to anaplasmosis limits insight into therapeutic options aside from antibiotics. However, in addition to receiving doxycycline, the patient was started on dexamethasone, which has demonstrated possible symptomatic benefit through small case studies. The dosage of Dexamethasone administered ranged from 4-20 mg, totaling 5 doses. The patient improved and was discharged home. Discussion: Human granulocytic anaplasmosis is caused by Anaplasma phagocytophilum. Ticks are the main vectors for this zoonotic disease, specifically the Ixodes tick. Like other tick-borne infections, it presents most commonly as a febrile illness. Our patient had several classic manifestations including leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated transaminases. Pulmonary symptoms are infrequently described aside from some reports of interstitial pneumonia and, rarely, ARDS. Doxycycline is the gold standard treatment for HGA. A few case reports have demonstrated clinical improvement with the addition of steroids when ARDS was present. Our patient saw improvement with the combination of corticosteroids, doxycycline, and ARDS evidencebased practices (i.e. pronation and low tidal volume ventilation). Similar management should be considered in other patients presenting with severe ARDS caused by HGA. Finally, although an atypical season for ticks, this case highlights the importance of a thorough social history and broad differentials, especially in patients presenting with severe illness.","Abdelwahab, N.; Schmidt, T.; Ingraham, N.

The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 is extensive, of which critical cases are with rapid disease progression and high mortality. The aim of our study is to summarize the characteristics of different subtypes and explore risk factors of illness severity for early identification and prompt treatment. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we collected data of patients confirmed COVID-19 in Zhejiang Province from 17 January to 12 February 2020. According to the definition of clinical classification, we divided confirmed cases into four types, and summarize epidemiological and clinical characteristics, laboratory and radiograph findings, treatments, and outcomes, respectively. Moreover, we used univariate and multivariate ordinal logistic regression models to explore risk factors for the severity of illness in patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 788 patients were enrolled in our study, of whom 52 cases (6.6%) were mild type, 658 cases (83.5%) were common type, 61 cases (7.2%) were severe type, and 17 cases (2.2%) were critical type. Multivariate ordinal logistic regression demonstrated increasing odds of the severity of illness in patients with COVID-19 associated with male (odds ratio [OR] = 1.7, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2-2.6 P = 0.008), fever (OR = 3.6, 95% CI: 2.1-6.3, P < 0.001), cough (OR = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.0-2.9, P = 0.041), hemoptysis (OR = 3.4, 95% CI: 1.1-10.3, P = 0.032), gastrointestinal symptoms (OR = 1.9, 95% CI: 1.0-3.5, P = 0.047), hypertension (OR = 2.6, 95% CI: 1.2-5.6, P = 0.013). With the increase of age-grading, risk for the severity of illness was gradually higher (&#8804; 18 years [OR = 1.0], 19-40 years [OR = 12.7, 95% CI: 4.5-36.0, P < 0.001], 41-65 years [OR = 14.8, 95% CI: 5.2-42.1, P < 0.001], &#8805; 66 years [OR = 56.5, 95% CI: 17.1-186.5, P < 0.001]).

AIMS: To investigate associations between clozapine treatment and increased risk of COVID-19 infection in patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders who are receiving antipsychotic medications in a geographically defined population in London, UK. METHOD: Using information from South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (SLAM) clinical records, via the Clinical Record Interactive Search system, we identified 6309 individuals who had an ICD-10 diagnosis of schizophrenia-spectrum disorders and were taking antipsychotics at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic onset in the UK. People who were on clozapine treatment were compared with those on any other antipsychotic treatment for risk of contracting COVID-19 between 1 March and 18 May 2020. We tested associations between clozapine treatment and COVID-19 infection, adjusting for gender, age, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), smoking status and SLAM service use. RESULTS: Of 6309 participants, 102 tested positive for COVID-19. Individuals who were on clozapine had increased risk of COVID-19 infection compared with those who were on other antipsychotic medication (unadjusted hazard ratio HR = 2.62, 95% CI 1.73-3.96), which was attenuated after adjusting for potential confounders, including clinical contact (adjusted HR = 1.76, 95% CI 1.14-2.72).

The problem can be visualized as a leader-follower game in which the operator is the leader that opens facilities, whereas the customer is the follower who observes the operator's location decision at first and then seeks services from the most preferred facility. Such a modeling perspective is of practical importance as we have witnessed its applications to various problems, such as the establishment of power plants in energy markets and the location of healthcare service centers for COVID-19 Vaccination. Despite that a considerable number of solution methodologies have been proposed, many of them are heuristic methods whose solution quality cannot be easily verified. Moreover, due to the hardness of the problems, existing exact approaches have limited performance. Motivated by these observations, we aim to develop an efficient exact algorithm for solving large-scale PUP models. We first propose a branch-and-cut decomposition algorithm and then design accelerated techniques to further enhance the performance. Using a broad testbed, we show that our algorithm outperforms various exact approaches by a large margin, and the advantage can go up to several orders of magnitude in terms of computational time in some datasets.

398393,Evaluating the Fellowship Experience During COVID-19: Adult Joint Reconstruction,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Proposing a scoring tool to predict COVID-19 patients' outcomes based on initially assessed clinical and CT features. METHODS: All patients, who were referred to a tertiary-university hospital respiratory triage (March 27-April 26, 2020), were highly clinically suggestive for COVID-19 and had undergone a chest CT scan were included. Those with positive rRT-PCR or highly clinically suspicious patients with typical chest CT scan pulmonary manifestations were considered confirmed COVID-19 for additional analyses. Patients, based on outcome, were categorized into outpatient, ordinary-ward admitted, intensive care unit (ICU) admitted, and deceased; their demographic, clinical, and chest CT scan parameters were compared. The pulmonary chest CT scan features were scaled with a novel semi-quantitative scoring system to assess pulmonary involvement (PI). RESULTS: Chest CT scans of 739 patients (mean age = 49.2 ± 17.2 years old, 56.7% male) were reviewed; 491 (66.4%), 176 (23.8%), and 72 (9.7%) cases were managed outpatient, in an ordinary ward, and ICU, respectively. A total of 439 (59.6%) patients were confirmed COVID-19 cases; their most prevalent chest CT scan features were ground-glass opacity (GGO) (93.3%), pleural-based peripheral distribution (60.3%), and multi-lobar (79.7%), bilateral (76.6%), and lower lobes (RLL and/or LLL) (89.1%) involvement. Patients with lower SpO2, advanced age, RR, total PI score or PI density score, and diffuse distribution or involvement of multi-lobar, bilateral, or lower lobes were more likely to be ICU admitted/expired. After adjusting for confounders, predictive models found cutoffs of age &#8805; 53, SpO2 &#8804; 91, and PI score &#8805; 8 (15) for ICU admission (death). A combination of all three factors showed 89.1% and 95% specificity and 81.9% and 91.4% accuracy for ICU admission and death outcomes, respectively. Solely evaluated high PI score had high sensitivity, specificity, and NPV in predicting the outcome as well. CONCLUSION: We strongly recommend patients with age &#8805; 53, SpO2 &#8804; 91, and PI score &#8805; 8 or even only high PI score to be considered as high-risk patients for further managements and care plans.

The causative organism was identified on 7th January 2020 as a novel coronavirus (nCoV or 2019-nCoV), later renamed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The resulting coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has infected over 88 million individuals, resulted in over 1.9 million deaths, and has led to an unprecedented impact on research activities worldwide. Extraordinary challenges have also been imposed on medical and surgical trainees following redeployment to full-time clinical duties. Moreover, the introduction of travel restrictions and strict lockdown measures have forced the closure of many institutions and laboratories working on research unrelated to the pandemic. The lockdown has similarly stifled supply chains and slowed research and development endeavours, whilst research charities have endured significant financial strains that have since reshaped the allocation and availability of funds. However, worldwide scientific adaptation to the COVID-19 pandemic has been observed through unprecedented levels of international collaboration alongside the uprise of remote telecommunication platforms.

All the constructs are assessed by self-report in an anonymous survey during the pandemic outbreak. The results show that the number of stressors has a positive relation with psychological symptoms, and social support has a negative relation with psychological symptoms. In addition, social support serves as a buffer against the negative impact of stressors. These findings hold implications for university counseling services during times of acute, large-scale stressors. Specifically, effective screening procedures should be developed to identify students who experience large number of stressors and provide suitable psychological intervention for them.","Li, Xiaoshan; Wu, Hou; Meng, Feifei; Li, Li; Wang, Yitong; Zhou, Mingjie",Front Psychiatry,,476

This article describes the results of the second survey conducted approximately six months after the crisis began. The rapid shift to telepsychological services seen in the first survey in the pandemic has solidified in the second survey. More providers reported delivering a larger percentage of services via telepsychology than early in the pandemic. The majority of respondents do not anticipate resuming in-person services until after a vaccine is made available, although a consistent minority reports ongoing in-person service provision. A majority reported their patients had appropriate access to internet and telepsychological service platforms, although one-fifth of respondents reported their patients had difficulty accessing such services. Early concerns about technological or regulatory problems involved in telepsychology are no longer evident. Most respondents indicated they will continue to use telepsychological services for the delivery of some of their psychological services after the pandemic ends. Forty-five percent knew of individuals who contracted the disease, 13% knew someone who died of the disease, and 2% reported contracted the disease themselves.","Sammons, Morgan T; VandenBos, Gary R; Martin, Jana N; Elchert, Daniel M",J Health Serv Psychol,,476

METHODS: From March 5 to May 10, 2020, the Raymond-Poincaré Hospital held a weekday consultation for HSMs for PCR testing. HSMs were requested to complete a questionnaire on their potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Of 200 HSMs screened, 70 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Ninety-nine HSMs completed the questionnaire of whom 28 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In the multivariable analysis, age of &#8805;44 years (aOR = 5.2, 95% CI [1.4-22.5]) and not systematically using a facemask when caring for a patient (aOR = 13.9, 95% CI [1.8-293.0]) were significantly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Working in a COVID-19-dedicated ward (aOR = 0.7, 95% CI [0.2-3.2]) was not significantly associated with infection. Community-related exposure in and outside the hospital, hospital meetings without facemasks (aOR = 21.3, 95% CI [4.5-143.9]) and private gatherings (aOR = 10, 95% CI [1.3-91.0]) were significantly associated with infection. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the effectiveness of barrier precautions and highlight in-hospital infections not related to patient care and infections related to exposure in the community.

METHODS: An electronic survey was sent to all women's healthcare providers, including physicians, mid-level providers and nurses, in all subspecialties of obstetrics and gynaecology (Ob/Gyn) at a large tertiary care university-affiliated hospital. RESULTS: Of the 278 eligible providers, the survey response rate was 45% (n = 127). Participants represented 8 Ob/Gyn subspecialties and all professional levels. Participants age 18-30 years were significantly more likely to feel that women should have access to infertility treatment despite the burden level of COVID-19 in respective community/states (p = 0.0058). Participants within the subspecialties of general Ob/Gyn, maternal foetal medicine and gynecologic oncology were significantly more likely to disagree that all women should refrain from planned conception during the COVID-19 pandemic, in comparison to those in urogynecology and reproductive endocrinology and infertility (p = 0.0003). CONCLUSIONS: Considering the immediate and unknown long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on fertility care delivery, a better understanding of perceptions regarding infertility management during this time is important. Our study shows overall support for the initial ASRM recommendations, representing a wide spectrum of women's health providers.","Wiltshire, Ashley; Jackson-Bey, Tia; Walker, Zachary; Chiang, Jasmine L; MacLennan, Paul A; Gunn, Deidre; Hurd, William W",J Assist Reprod Genet,,476
400681,Nurse Leaders' Knowledge and Confidence Managing Disasters in the Acute Care Setting,2021,"BACKGROUND: As the use of technology to deliver health services is increasing rapidly and has further intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic, these initiatives may fail if ethical impacts are not fully identified and acted upon by practitioners. Ignoring the ethical impacts of information and communication technology health service delivery creates an unintended risk for patients and can lead to reduced effectiveness, noncompliance, and harm, undermining the best intentions of governments and clinicians. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to explore how ethical considerations or impacts may be different, greater, or more variable in information and communication technology methods versus face-to-face health care delivery models, and how they may be applied in practice. METHODS: We undertook a systemic literature review to provide a critical overview of existing research into the incorporation of ethical principles into telehealth practice. Six databases were searched between March 2016 to May 2016 and again in December 2020 to provide the benefit of currency. A combination of broad terms (""ethics,"" ""ethical,"" ""health,"" and ""care"") with the restrictive terms of ""telehealth"" and ""telemedicine"" was used in keyword searches. Thematic analysis and synthesis of each paper was conducted, aligned to the framework developed by Beauchamp and Childress. RESULTS: From the 49 papers reviewed, authors identified or discussed the following ethical principles in relation to telehealth practice: autonomy (69% of authors, 34/49), professional-patient relationship (53% of authors, 26/49), nonmaleficence (41% of authors, 20/49), beneficence (39%, of authors, 19/49), and justice (39% of authors, 19/49). CONCLUSIONS: Although a small number of studies identified ethical issues associated with telehealth practice and discussed their potential impact on service quality and effectiveness, there is limited research on how ethical principles are incorporated into clinical practice. Several studies proposed frameworks, codes of conduct, or guidelines, but there was little discussion or evidence of how these recommendations are being used to improve ethical telehealth practice.","Keenan, Amanda Jane; Tsourtos, George; Tieman, Jennifer",J Med Internet Res,,476

Or do they open new ways towards a new type of urban development more effective in times of environmental and health crises? We address these questions through literature review and three case studies that review policies and practices for the transformation of city ecosystems mostly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic: (a) the central business district, (b) the transport ecosystem, and (c) the tourism–hospitality ecosystem We assess whether the measures implemented in these ecosystems shape new policy and planning models for higher readiness of cities towards grand challenges, and how, based on this experience, cities should be organized to tackle the grand challenge of environmental sustainability and climate change","Kakderi, Christina Komninos Nicos Panori Anastasia Oikonomaki Eleni",Sustainability,,476

In the first month of operations, we monitored a total of 2129 clinical encounters, with the majority of patients between 17-35 years of age and between day 2 to day 6 of illness upon admission. Overall, there was a good outcome for the patients, with only 2.3% requiring transfer back to restructured hospitals. There was also no mortality.

The current epidemic is spreading in China and even the world. The virus has the characteristics of strong infectivity, long incubation period, mainly spread by droplets, close contact. So far there is no specific drug treatment. There are nearly 100,000 confirmed cases worldwide. Methods: In the current severe situation of the epidemic, this paper uses the methods of literature, investigation and logical and so on. Results: According to the special environment of China, the concept of One Health is proposed for prevention and control. Under the leadership of the government, multiple functional departments and disciplines cooperate to exchange information, forming a working mechanism of efficient coordination, seamless connection, a combination of prevention and control, and coordination among the masses. Conclusion: The government should set up a department of ""One Health"" to promote the coordination and cooperation between multiple departments and disciplines. It is suggested: 1. Strengthening infectious disease medical personnel training and public health research; 2. To intervene in the psychological crisis of different groups;3. Provide security and logistic support for medical staff; 4. Guarantee the reserve of protective and medical materials;5. Vigilance and prevention and control of the ""weak period"" of the epidemic; 6. International opinion dominates.","Weng, Yanghui",Acta Med. Mediterr.,,476

404250,COVID-19 and careers: On the futility of generational explanations,2020,"Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) have been broadly applied in biomedicine in recent years. So far, researches have reported that GQDs might contribute to the injury of the central nervous system (CNS), yet the latent toxicological mechanism is not clear. This study aims to investigate the underlying biological mechanism responsible for the neurotoxicity of nitrogen-doped GQDs (N-GQDs) and amino-functionalized GQDs (A-GQDs) by use of genome-wide transcription microarray. The findings showed that 174 and 1341 genes were altered significantly in the BV2 cells treated by 25 µg/mL N-GQDs and 100 µg/mL N-GQDs compared with the control, respectively. As for the BV2 cells exposed to 100 µg/mL A-GQDs, 1396 diversely expressed genes were detected. By comparing the 100 µg/mL N-GQDs exposed group with 100 µg/mL A-GQDs exposed group, the expression of 256 genes was extensively altered, including 58 upregulated genes and 198 downregulated genes. From Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, the altered genes were mainly enriched in functions of ion channel activation and cellular processes. Based on the KEGG pathway and signal-net analysis, the toxicity of GQDs in BV2 cells was closely related to calcium signaling pathway, cell cycle and endocytosis. And the pathways that the shared mRNAs involved all served as the crucial roles in the neurotoxicity of GQDs despite the chemical functionalization (N-GQDs or A-GQDs). In addition, the consequences from qRT-PCR, Western blot, intracellular calcium level measurements and comet assay further confirmed that calcium dyshomeostasis, DNA damage and cell cycle arrest were the key factors responsible for the GQDs-induced neurotoxicity through affecting several classical signaling pathways. In conclusion, our research will supply essential data for further studies on mechanisms of GQDs-induced neurotoxicity by use of genome-wide screening.","Liang, Xue; Wu, Tianshu; Tang, Meng",Sci Total Environ,,476

Many infected clusters have been found within familial households, but the data about secondary transmission among household contacts is limited. METHODS: In this retrospective case series, we enrolled 85 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and their household members in Wuhan. Patients were confirmed infected with SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays on throat swabs. Epidemiological, clinical and laboratory data of the household members were collected. RESULTS: There were 155 close contacts in total. 104 contacts received RT-PCR assays, with 47 (30%) positive cases and 57 (37%) negative cases. 51 (33%) cases did not received RT-PCR tests for they showed no symptoms of pneumonia during the 2 weeks of quarantine. The infection rate of close contacts was 38% for households with 1 contact, 50% for households with 2 contacts, and 31% for households with 3 contacts. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of secondary transmission among household contacts of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection was 30%.

The interventions employed by various health authorities in combating the infection may help in eliminating the threat; however, they have long-term cognitive and mental health effects on the population. Aims: The primary objective was to assess the prevalent concerns and coping strategies and perspectives in persons suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection under institutional quarantine in India during the period from April 2020 to May 2020. Setting and Design: Its a cross-sectional observational study conducted in the National Cancer Institute, Jhajjar, India. Methodology: After ethical clearance, convenience sampling was done. Relevant demographic details were obtained. Health-care professionally administered questionnaire to assess psychological concerns and coping mechanisms. All statistics are deemed to be descriptive only. Results: The most common physical concern was fever seen in 37% of respondents, followed by cough in 31% and sore throat in 29%. In terms of emotional concerns, 55.3% of respondents were worried and 43% were anxious and 33% were sad. About 80.6% of participants selected support from family and friends helped them cope during the institutional quarantine. 57% maintained a daily routine, 70% selected praying, and 45% used music as a coping strategy. Only 2% felt that they were unable to cope. Conclusion: It highlights that the psychological impact of illness on affected individuals should not be overlooked as it may have the potential to cause major psychiatric morbidity. It also provides a crucial assessment of their coping mechanisms.","Singh, Neha; Kumar, Sanjeev; Rathore, Puneet; Vig, Saurabh; Vallath, Nandini; Mohan, Anant; Bhatnagar, Sushma",Indian J.

METHODS: The Hospital Infection Control Committee (HICC) and virology testing records were combined to identify SARS-Cov-2 positive HCWs and study the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 over 6 months. RESULT: COVID 19 cases in our HCWs cohort rose and declined parallel to community cases. Forty two out of 534 HCWs (8%) were SARS-Cov-2 positive with no fatalities. No clinical staff in the special COVID ward or ICU was positive. Significant proportion of non-clinical staff (30%) were SARS-Cov-2 positive. About 70% of SARS-Cov-2 positive staff had likely community acquisition, with a significant proportion having travelled by public transport or having a contact history with a positive case in the community. Twenty four percent of positive staff were asymptomatic and detected positive on re-joining test. CONCLUSION: Sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-22 did not occur in our cohort beyond community transmission. Appropriate PPE use, strict and constantly improving infection control measures and testing of both clinical and non-clinical staff were essential methods for restricting transmission amongst HCWs.","Pandrowala, Ambreen; Shaikh, Shaheen; Balsekar, Mahesh; Kirolkar, Suverna; Udani, Soonu",Indian pediatr,,476
406997,Acute Limb Ischemia as the Initial Severe Presentation in COVID-19,2021,"Mumps is a vaccine-preventable disease. Because the mumps vaccine can cause aseptic meningitis in rare cases, this vaccine is not routine in Japan. This has led to low vaccine coverage and severe disease burden in Japan. The present review summarizes mumps epidemiology and vaccination and discusses effective future strategies to mitigate the current disease burden of mumps in Japan. Although a recent study reported that mumps vaccine coverage rates are improving in Japan, current coverage rates are far below the optimal rate to suppress the ongoing epidemic, which has caused an average annual financial loss of 85 billion JPY between 2000 and 2016. Recent reports have demonstrated a much lower incidence of vaccine-induced aseptic meningitis in newly developed vaccines, especially when administered at 1 year of age. Cost-effectiveness studies suggest that routinization of the currently distributed domestic vaccine would be highly cost-effective. In addition, questionnaire surveillance data suggest that the majority of the Japanese population accepts the nominal risk of the vaccine when the proper information is provided. Finally, there are some successful programs in Japan that have attained high vaccine coverage rates with financial support from local governments. Taken together, these data suggest that the mumps vaccine should be immediately included in routine vaccines in Japan.","Kitano, Taito",Hum Vaccin Immunother,,476

We used an innovative online diary instrument that has proved both reliable and quick-to-field. Combining diary information on activity, location, and co-presence to estimate infection risks associated with daily behavior, we show clear changes in risk-associated behavior between the pre, full-lockdown and post full-lockdown periods. We document a shift from more to less risky daily behavior patterns (combinations of activity/location/co-presence categories) between the pre-pandemic pattern and full lockdown in May/June 2020, followed by a reversion (although not a complete reversal) of those patterns in August 2020 following the end of the first lockdown. Because, in general, a populations' time use changes relatively slowly, the behavioral changes revealed may be interpreted as a consequence of the UK COVID-19 lockdown social restrictions and their subsequent relaxation.","Gershuny, Jonathan; Sullivan, Oriel; Sevilla, Almudena; Vega-Rapun, Marga; Foliano, Francesca; Lamote de Grignon, Juana; Harms, Teresa; Walthery, Pierre",PLoS One,,476

A total of 92,977,768 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 1,991,289 deaths were reported globally up to January 14, 2021. COVID-19 also affects people's mental health and quality of life. At present, there is no effective therapeutic strategy for the management of this disease. Therefore, in the absence of a specific vaccine or curative treatment, it is an urgent need to identify safe, effective and globally available drugs for reducing COVID-19 morbidity and fatalities. In this review, we focus on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs: a class of antidepressant drugs with widespread availability and an optimal tolerability profile) that can potentially be repurposed for COVID-19 and are currently being tested in clinical trials. We also summarize the existing literature on what is known about the link between serotonin (5-HT) and the immune system. From the evidence reviewed here, we propose fluoxetine as an adjuvant therapeutic agent for COVID-19 based on its known immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties. Fluoxetine may potentially reduce pro-inflammatory chemokine/cytokines levels (such as CCL-2, IL-6, and TNF-&#945;) in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, fluoxetine may help to attenuate neurological complications of COVID-19.","Pashaei, Yaser",J Clin Neurosci,,476

METHODS: From 1980 to 2002, 125 patients were treated at our hospital and selected retrospectively for this study. The series mean age was 63,6±11,3 years, being 77.6% males and 22.4% females. The proportions of G!, G2 and G3 TCC were: 48%, 35.2% and 16.8%. The T stage was: pTa-1 - 85 (68%) and pT2-4 - 40 (32%). Superficial tumors were treated by TUR alone or plus BCG (>G1), and the invasives ones by radical cystectomy. The vesical reccurence rate of superficial TCC was 48.2%. RESULTS: TCC grade showed a positive association with T stage (p 0.0001) and patient survival (p 0.0001), but not with local bladder reccurence of superficial tumors (p=0.72). The T stage also showed a strong correlation with patient survival (p 0.0001). CONCLUSION: The TCC is more common in male than in female with mean age of 63.2 years. The tumor grading and staging exhibited as strong predictive value for disease progression and patient survival.","Brianezi Tiraboschi, Ricardo; Anastácio Dias-Neto, José; Carlos Pereira Martins, Antonio; José Cologna, Adauto; Jorge Suaid, Haylton; Tucci Jr, Silvio",Acta cir. bras.,,476

410782,Telepsychiatry in the time of COVID-19: Shattering assumptions,2020,"Certain answers are a principled method for coping with the uncertainty that arises in many practical data management tasks. Unfortunately, this method is expensive and may exclude useful (if uncertain) answers. Prior work introduced Uncertainty Annotated Databases (UA-DBs), which combine an under- and over-approximation of certain answers. UA-DBs combine the reliability of certain answers based on incomplete K-relations with the performance of classical deterministic database systems. However, UA-DBs only support a limited class of queries and do not support attribute-level uncertainty which can lead to inaccurate under-approximations of certain answers. In this paper, we introduce attribute-annotated uncertain databases (AU-DBs) which extend the UA-DB model with attribute-level annotations that record bounds on the values of an attribute across all possible worlds. This enables more precise approximations of incomplete databases. Furthermore, we extend UA-DBs to encode an compact over-approximation of possible answers which is necessary to support non-monotone queries including aggregation and set difference. We prove that query processing over AU-DBs preserves the bounds of certain and possible answers and investigate algorithms for compacting intermediate results to retain efficiency. Through an compact encoding of possible answers, our approach also provides a solid foundation for handling missing data. Using optimizations that trade accuracy for performance, our approach scales to complex queries and large datasets, and produces accurate results. Furthermore, it significantly outperforms alternative methods for uncertain data management.","Feng, Su; Huber, Aaron; Glavic, Boris; Kennedy, Oliver",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.11796v1.pdf,476

Owing to the unavailability of vaccination, educating people is reckoned to be of utmost importance to mitigate the risk. With a plethora of unstructured data available on social media, it becomes crucial to comprehend information and use it effectively to combat COVID-19. A fine-grained knowledge base could be advantageous in developing a reliable social network for pandemic situations. However, there has been no prior finding related to the identification of disseminators forCOVID-19 and hence, there is a need to build a computationally intelligent system that utilizes the potential of a massive amount of data to disseminate information more effectively. In this work, we gathered Twitter data of 3.2 million unique users, consisting of over 12 million tweets. We divided our work into four parts. Firstly, by employing dense vector embedding, one of the techniques of the neural network, to generate semantically similar keywords. Secondly, we classified the collected data into three awareness categories i.e., information, prevention, and action. Thereafter, we used the statistical physics of complex networks to recognize prominent disseminators w.r.t. the identified categories. Finally, we sub-categorized the prominent disseminators into media, people, and organizations based on their profile information. From the result, we concluded that data generated broadly fall into information and prevention categories, whereas the print media, politicians, and health organizations are the forerunners of the selected prominent disseminators. © 2017 IEEE.","Agarwal, A.; Uniyal, D.; Toshniwal, D.; Deb, D.",IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computational Intelligence,,476

414566,Focus on Characteristics of COVID-19 with the Special Reference to the Impact of COVID-19 on the Urogenital System,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic represents an unprecedented challenge to healthcare systems and nations across the world. Particularly challenging are the lack of agreed-upon management guidelines and variations in practice. Our hospital is a large, secondary-care government hospital in Kuwait, which has increased its capacity by approximately 28% to manage the care of patients with COVID-19. The surge in capacity has necessitated the redeployment of staff who are not well-trained to manage such conditions. There was a great need to develop a tool to help redeployed staff in decision-making for patients with COVID-19, a tool which could also be used for training. METHODS: Based on the best available clinical knowledge and best practices, an eight member multidisciplinary group of clinical and quality experts undertook the development of a clinical algorithm-based toolkit to guide training and practice for the management of patients with COVID-19. The team followed Horabin and Lewis' seven-step approach in developing the algorithms and a five-step method in writing them. Moreover, we applied Rosenfeld et al's five points to each algorithm. RESULTS: A set of seven clinical algorithms and one illustrative layout diagram were developed. The algorithms were augmented with documentation forms, data-collection online forms and spreadsheets and an indicators' reference sheet to guide implementation and performance measurement. The final version underwent several revisions and amendments prior to approval. CONCLUSIONS: A large volume of published literature on the topic of COVID-19 pandemic was translated into a user-friendly, algorithm-based toolkit for the management of patients with COVID-19. This toolkit can be used for training and decision-making to improve the quality of care provided to patients with COVID-19.","Salem, Ahmed; Elamir, Hossam; Alfoudri, Huda; Shamsah, Mohammed; Abdelraheem, Shams; Abdo, Ibtissam; Galal, Mohammad; Ali, Lamiaa",,,476

As a consequence, the need is increasing for appropriately designed long-term care (LTC) environments and design guidelines for these settings. This investigation presents the findings of a broad literature review on biophilic design and its application to a set of LTC architectural case studies selected for the degree to which each variously expresses key attributes of a set of ten biophilic patterns particularly rooted in the day to day experience of the aged in these care settings: visual connections with nature, non-visual connection with nature, non-rhythmic sensory stimuli, thermal and airflow variability, presence of water, dynamic and diffused light, complexity and order, prospect, refuge, and mystery. The three methodological aims are to conduct an in-depth literature review, to distill the aforementioned subset of biophilic patterns with respect to how the aged experience their built surroundings, and third, to examine these in light of their various expression in recently built state-of-the art LTC settings for persons with dementia and related cognitive disorders. Residents’ engagement with and proximity to nature and landscape, and transactions with biophilia-inspired artifacts was the principal focus. The case studies are further examined in relation to the planning and design of LTC environments in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

415560,Using altmetrics for detecting impactful research in quasi-zero-day time-windows: the case of COVID-19,2021,"Purpose: The new normal introduced by COVID-19 has ushered in new safety regulations that are required to be implemented by all organisations, including the construction industry. The implementation of the COVID-19 regulations, like any health and safety regulation, is not without hindrances. Consequently, this study aims to explore factors hindering the implementation of COVID-19 safety regulations at construction sites in Ghana. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopted a qualitative research method using an open-ended questionnaire as a data collection instrument. The set of questionnaires were distributed by means of purposive and snowball sampling methods. The collected data were analysed by means of the thematic analysis technique. Findings: It became evident that several factors militate against implementing COVID-19 safety regulations at construction sites. Cost of implementing COVID-19 safety measures, lack of compliance and ignorance were identified as the most hindering factors, whereas superstition, lack of personal protective equipment supply and theft of COVID-19 materials were reported by fewer respondents. Research limitations/implications: The set of questionnaires were limited to small construction firms who were operating on site within the Central, Western and Greater Accra regions of Ghana during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the findings may be applicable to firms outside these regions because most of the small construction firms in the country share similar characteristics. Practical implications: The recommendations proffered could help construction organisations devise strategies to overcome the barriers that hamper the implementation of COVID-19 safety regulations on site. Moreover, the findings could inform policymakers on what is required to enforce compliance on site. Originality/value: COVID 19 is still new, and as a result, the body of knowledge is at the infancy stage. This article contributes to advancing the body of knowledge in the area of COVID-19 implementation challenges on construction sites. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Simpeh, F.; Bamfo-Agyei, E.; Amoah, C.","Journal of Engineering, Design and Technology",,476

Given that a vaccine will eventually be produced, information will be needed to support a potential campaign to promote vaccination. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the variables affecting the likelihood of refusal and indecision toward a vaccine against COVID-19 and to determine the acceptance of the vaccine for different scenarios of effectiveness and side effects. Materials and Methods: A multinomial logistic regression method based on the Health Belief Model was used to estimate the current methodology, using data obtained by an online anonymous survey of 370 respondents in Chile. Results: The results indicate that 49% of respondents were willing to be vaccinated, with 28% undecided or 77% of individuals who would potentially be willing to be inoculated. The main variables that explained the probability of rejection or indecision were associated with the severity of COVID-19, such as, the side effects and effectiveness of the vaccine; perceived benefits, including immunity, decreased fear of contagion, and the protection of oneself and the environment; action signals, such as, responses from ones' family and the government, available information, and specialists' recommendations; and susceptibility, including the contagion rate per 1,000 inhabitants and relatives with COVID-19, among others. Our analysis of hypothetical vaccine scenarios revealed that individuals preferred less risky vaccines in terms of fewer side effects, rather than effectiveness. Additionally, the variables that explained the indecision toward or rejection of a potential COVID-19 vaccine could be used in designing public health policies. Conclusions: We discovered that it is necessary to formulate specific, differentiated vaccination-promotion strategies for the anti-vaccine and undecided groups based on the factors that explain the probability of individuals refusing or expressing hesitation toward vaccination.","Cerda, Arcadio A; García, Leidy Y",Front Public Health,,476

The Gr-FET immunosensors can rapidly identify (about 2 mins) and accurately capture the COVID-19 spike protein S1 (which contains a receptor binding domain, RBD) at a limit of detection down to 0.2 pM, in a real-time and label-free manner. Further results ensure that the Gr-FET immunosensors can be promisingly applied to screen for high-affinity antibodies (with binding constant up to 2*10^11 M^-1 against the RBD) at concentrations down to 0.1 pM. Thus, our developed electrical Gr-FET immunosensors provide an appealing alternative to address the early screening/diagnosis as well as the analysis and rational design of neutralizing-antibody locking methods of this ongoing public health crisis.","Zhang, Xiaoyan; Qi, Qige; Jing, Qiushi; Ao, Shen; Zhang, Zhihong; Ding, Mingchao; Wu, Muhong; Liu, Kaihui; Wang, Weipeng; Ling, Yunhan; Zhang, Zhengjun; Fu, Wangyang",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.12529v1.pdf,476

The psychological impact on frontline doctors of dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic is currently unknown. This longitudinal professional survey aims to understand the evolving and cumulative effects of working during the COVID-19 outbreak on the psychological well-being of doctors working in emergency departments (ED), intensive care units (ICU) and anaesthetics during the pandemic. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is a longitudinal questionnaire-based study with three predefined time points spanning the acceleration, peak and deceleration phases of the COVID-19 pandemic.The primary outcomes are psychological distress and post-trauma stress as measured by the General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12) and Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R). Data related to personal and professional characteristics will also be collected. Questionnaires will be administered prospectively to all doctors working in ED, ICU and anaesthetics in the UK and Ireland via existing research networks during the sampling period. Data from the questionnaires will be analysed to assess the prevalence and degree of psychological distress and trauma, and the nature of the relationship between personal and professional characteristics and the primary outcomes. Data will be described, analysed and disseminated at each time point; however, the primary endpoint will be psychological distress and trauma at the final time point. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was obtained from the University of Bath, UK (ref: 4421), and Children's Health Ireland at Crumlin, Ethics Committee. Regulatory approval from the Health Regulation Authority (UK), Health and Care Research Wales (IRAS: 281944).This study is limited by the fact that it focuses on doctors only and is survey based without further qualitative interviews of participants. It is expected this study will provide clear evidence of the psychological impact of COVID-19 on doctors and will allow present and future planning to mitigate against any psychological impact.

418012,"The impact of social problem skills on academic motivation by means of Covid-19 fear: A SEM Model: Social Problem Solving, Covid-19, Academic Motivation",2021,"The current fears of a future influenza pandemic have resulted in an increased emphasis on the development and testing of novel therapeutic strategies against the virus. Fundamental to this is the ferret model of influenza infection, which is critical in examining pathogenesis and treatment. Nevertheless, a precise evaluation of the efficacy of any treatment strategy in ferrets is reliant on understanding the immune response in this model. Interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) are interferon-stimulated proteins shown to be critically important in the host immune response against viral infections. These proteins confer intrinsic innate immunity to pH-dependent viruses such as influenza viruses and can inhibit cytosolic entry of such viruses to limit the severity of infection following interferon upregulation. Mutations in IFITM genes in humans have been identified as key risk factors for worsened disease progression, particularly in the case of avian influenza viruses such as H7N9. While the IFITM genes of humans and mice have been well characterized, no studies have been conducted to classify the IFITM locus and interferon-driven upregulation of IFITMs in ferrets. Here, we show the architecture of the ferret IFITM locus and its synteny to the IFITM locus of other mammalian and avian species. Furthermore, we show that ferret IFITM1, -2, and -3 are functionally responsive to both interferon-&#945; (IFN-&#945;) and influenza virus stimulation. Thus, we show that ferret IFITMs exhibit interferon-stimulated properties similar to those shown in other species, furthering our knowledge of the innate immune response in the ferret model of human influenza virus infections. IMPORTANCE IFITM proteins can prevent the entry of several pH-dependent viruses, including high-consequence viruses such as HIV, influenza viruses, and SARS-coronaviruses. Mutations in these genes have been associated with worsened disease outcomes with mutations in their IFITM genes, highlighting these genes as potential disease risk factors. Ferrets provide a valuable tool to model infectious diseases; however, there is a critical shortage of information regarding their interferon-stimulated genes. We identified the putative ferret IFITM genes and mapped their complete gene locus. Thus, our study fills a critical gap in knowledge and supports the further use of the ferret model to explore the importance of IFITMs in these important diseases.","Horman, William S J; Kedzierska, Katherine; Rootes, Christina L; Bean, Andrew G D; Nguyen, Thi H O; Layton, Daniel S",J Virol,,476
418210,Epidemiology of Lymphedema-related admissions in the United States: 2012-2017,2020,"The outbreak of COVID-19, a global health challenge faced by countries worldwide, led to a lockdown in India, thereby bringing down the emissions of various air pollutants. Here, we discuss the behaviour of surface ozone (O3) concentrations and its precursors, oxides of nitrogen (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), and volatile organic compounds (VOC) at two Indian megacities namely Mumbai and Pune, closely located yet vastly differing in meteorology due to their locations. Although levels of CO, NO2, and VOC declined sharply after the lockdown in both cities, with NO2 showing the highest reduction, ozone concentration in Pune remained unaffected, whereas Mumbai exhibited a mixed trend, touching even a maximum in between the lockdown. On a diurnal scale, the magnitude of O3 levels during the lockdown period is higher at almost all hours in Mumbai, and in Pune, it is almost identical except during night hours when it is marginally higher in the lockdown period as compared to the normal period. On a whole, the pollution levels were brought down significantly which can be used as a benchmark in the future for the implementation of policies related to air quality management and emission control in Indian megacities by the policymakers. These results also can pave a way for the scientific community for local air quality modelling.","Korhale, Nikhil; Anand, Vrinda; Beig, Gufran",Air Qual Atmos Health,,476

A total of 94 nasopharyngeal swab samples were obtained from 80 confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 cases in the first 2 weeks of illness (median, 7 days; range, 2-14 days) and 14 healthy controls. After collection, all samples were transported to the hospital clinical laboratory within 24 h. These samples were tested on all five assays within 3 days of sample receipt. Of the 94 samples, 69 yielded the same result on all platforms, resulting in an agreement of 73.4% (69 of 94). Of these, 14 were the healthy control swabs which all tested negative, demonstrating good specificity across all platforms. The ARIES assay had the lowest detection rate (68.8%), followed by Fortitude (85.0%), RealStar (86.3%), cobas (95.0%), and TaqPath (100%). Statistically significant differences were observed for ARIES, Fortitude, and RealStar when compared against the best performing TaqPath using McNemar's &#967;2 test. A consensus result was established based on the results obtained by the cobas, Fortitude, RealStar, and TaqPath. Six discrepancies had failed to reach a consensus and were adjudicated using the Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2. Overall, the TaqPath and cobas assays were the most sensitive at detecting their designated SARS-CoV-2 gene targets. On the other hand, the ARIES assay was the least sensitive, thus warranting the need for assay re-optimization before go-live at the testing laboratory.","Lee, Chun Kiat; Tham, Jason Wei Ming; Png, Siyu; Chai, Chean Nee; Ng, Shu Chi; Tan, Eunice Jia Min; Ng, Li Jie; Chua, Rui Ping; Sani, Musa; Seow, Yiqi; Yan, Gabriel; Tang, Julian",J Med Virol,,476

There is relatively little evidence on young peoples mental health in Low-and-Middle-Income-Countries (LMICs) as the pandemic has progressed. MethodsTwo consecutive phone-surveys (August/October and November/December 2020) in Ethiopia, India, Peru and Vietnam interviewed around 9,000 participants of a 20-year cohort study who grew up in poverty (now aged 19 and 26). We investigate how young peoples mental health has evolved in the four countries during the pandemic. Rates of (at least mild) anxiety (depression) measured by GAD-7 (PHQ-8) were compared across countries; between males/females, and food secure/food insecure households. ResultsOverall, rates of at least mild anxiety (depression) significantly decreased in all countries but Ethiopia as infection rates fell. However, young people in food insecure households report high rates of anxiety and depression and have not shown consistent improvements. Food insecure households are poorer, and have significantly more children (p<0.05) except in Ethiopia. ConclusionsFood insecurity has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic and is negatively associated with young peoples mental health.

Since the increase in economic uncertainty is limiting production capacity and consumers’ marginal propensity to consume, which reduces CO2 emissions, economic policy uncertainty has become one of the most important factors affecting CO2 emissions. COVID-19 has demonstrated that economic policy uncertainty reduces the enthusiasm of market participants, which, in turn, reduces energy demand and CO2 emissions. In order to further study the impact of economic policy uncertainty on air pollution, this study uses a panel model to empirically test the data for a sample of 15 countries covering the period from 1997 to 2019. According to the empirical results, we find that the economic policy uncertainty has a significant negative impact on per capita CO2 emissions. That is, the higher the uncertainty of economic policy, the lower the per capita CO2 emissions of countries. What’s more, this negative effect is larger in emerging market countries than in advanced countries. © 2021 by the authors.

422145,Sidebar: North Carolina's Process for Developing Our COVID-19 Vaccine Plan,2021,"BACKGROUND: The collaborative clinical simulation (CCS) model is a structured method for the development and assessment of clinical competencies through small groups working collaboratively in simulated environments. From 2016 onward, the CCS model has been applied successfully among undergraduate and graduate medical students from the Universidad de Talca, Chile; the Universität de Barcelona, Spain; and the Universidad de Vic-Manresa, Spain. All the templates for building the clinical cases and the assessment instruments with CCS were printed on paper. Considering the large number of CCS sessions and the number of participating students that are required throughout the medical degree curriculum, it is impossible to keep an organized record when the instruments are printed on paper. Moreover, with the COVID-19 pandemic, web platforms have become important as safe training environments for students and medical faculties; this new educational environment should include the consolidation and adaptation of didactic sessions that create and use available virtual cases and use different web platforms. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to describe the design and development of a web platform that was created to strengthen the CCS model. METHODS: The design of the web platform aimed to support each phase of the CCS by incorporating functional requirements (ie, features that the web platform will be able to perform) and nonfunctional requirements (ie, how the web platform should behave) that are needed to run collaborative sessions. The software was developed under the Model-View-Controller architecture to separate the views from the data model and the business logic. RESULTS: MOSAICO is a web platform used to design, perform, and assess collaborative clinical scenarios for medical students. MOSAICO has four modules: educational design, students' collaborative design, collaborative simulation, and collaborative debriefing. The web platform has three different user profiles: academic simulation unit, teacher, and student. These users interact under different roles in collaborative simulations. MOSAICO enables a collaborative environment, which is connected via the internet, to design clinical scenarios guided by the teacher and enables the use of all data generated to be discussed in the debriefing session with the teacher as a guide. The web platform is running at the Universidad de Talca in Chile and is supporting collaborative simulation activities via the internet for two medical courses: (1) Semiology for third-year students (70 students in total) and (2) Medical Genetics for fifth-year students (30 students in total). CONCLUSIONS: MOSAICO is applicable within the CCS model and is used frequently in different simulation sessions at the Universidad de Talca, where medical students can work collaboratively via the internet. MOSAICO simplifies the application and reuse of clinical simulation scenarios, allowing its use in multiple simulation centers. Moreover, its applications in different courses (ie, a large part of the medical curriculum) support the automatic tracking of simulation activities and their assessment.","Guinez-Molinos, Sergio; Gonzalez Díaz, Jaime; Gomar Sancho, Carmen; Espinoza, Paulina; Constenla, Gustavo",JMIR Med Educ,,476

422371,"Effectiveness of thermal screening in detection of COVID-19 among truck drivers at Mutukula Land Point of Entry, Uganda",2021,"OBJECTIVE: While COVID-19 symptoms impact rhinology (anosmia) and laryngology (airways), two major disciplines of the otolaryngology armamentarium, the virus has seemed to spare the auditory system. A recent study, however, reported changes in otoacoustic emission (OAE) signals measured in SARS-COV-2 positive patients. We sought to assess the effect of COVID-19 infection on auditory performance in a cohort of recovered SARS-COV-2 patients and controls. To avoid a potential bias of previous audiological dysfunction not related to SARS-COV-2 infection, the study encompasses patients with normal auditory history. We hypothesized that if SARS-COV-2 infection predisposes to hearing loss, we would observe subtle and early audiometric deficits in our cohort in the form of subclinical auditory changes. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: The Institutional Review Board approved the study and we recruited participants who had been positive for SARS-COV-2 infection, according to an Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test on two nasopharyngeal swabs. The patients included in this study were asymptomatic for the SARS-COV-2 infection and were evaluated following recovery, confirmed by repeated swab testing. The control group comprised healthy individuals matched for age and sex, and with a normal auditory and otologic history. INTERVENTIONS: The eligibility to participate in this study included a normal audiogram, no previous auditory symptoms, normal otoscopy examination with an intact tympanic membrane, and bilateral tympanometry type A. None of our volunteers reported any new auditory symptoms following SARS-COV-2 infection. Ototacoustic emissions (OAE) and auditory brainstem response (ABR) measurements were used to evaluate the auditory function. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: OAE and ABR measurements. RESULTS: We have found no significant differences between recovered asymptomatic SARS-COV-2 patients and controls in any of transitory evoked otoacoustic emission (TEOAE), distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE), or ABR responses. CONCLUSIONS: There is no cochlear dysfunction represented by ABR, TEOAE, and DPOAE responses in recovered COVID-19 asymptomatic patients. Retrocochlear function was also preserved as evident by the ABR responses. A long-term evaluation of a larger cohort of SARS-COV-2 patients will help to identify a possible contribution of SARS-COV-2 infection to recently published anecdotal auditory symptoms associated with COVID-19.","Dror, Amiel A; Kassis-Karayanni, Najla; Oved, Adi; Daoud, Amani; Eisenbach, Netanel; Mizrachi, Matti; Rayan, Doaa; Francis, Shawky; Layous, Eli; Gutkovich, Yoni Evgeni; Taiber, Shahar; Srouji, Samer; Chordekar, Shai; Goldenstein, Sonia; Ziv, Yael; Ronen, Ohad; Gruber, Maayan; Avraham, Karen B; Sela, Eyal",Otol Neurotol,,476

This study aimed to describe the clinical features of COVID-19 in rheumatic patients and provide information for handling this situation in clinical practice. METHODS: This is a retrospective case series study. Deidentified data, including gender, age, laboratory and radiological results, symptoms, signs, and medication history, were collected from 2326 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, including 21 cases in combination with rheumatic disease, in Tongji Hospital between 13 January and 15 March 2020. RESULTS: Length of hospital stay and mortality rate were similar between rheumatic and non-rheumatic groups, while the presence of respiratory failure was more common in rheumatic cases (38% vs 10%, p<0.001). Symptoms of fever, fatigue and diarrhoea were seen in 76%, 43% and 23% of patients, respectively. There were four rheumatic patients who experienced a flare of rheumatic disease during hospital stay, with symptoms of muscle aches, back pain, joint pain or rash. While lymphocytopaenia was seen in 57% of rheumatic patients, only one patient (5%) presented with leucopenia in rheumatic cases. Rheumatic patients presented with similar radiological features of ground-glass opacity and consolidation. Patients with pre-existing interstitial lung disease showed massive fibrous stripes and crazy-paving signs at an early stage. Five rheumatic cases used hydroxychloroquine before the diagnosis of COVID-19 and none progressed to critically ill stage. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory failure was more common in rheumatic patients infected with COVID-19. Differential diagnosis between COVID-19 and a flare of rheumatic disease should be considered.

Here, we describe an in-depth investigation using whole genome sequencing of outbreaks on 16 mink farms and the humans living or working on these farms. We conclude that the virus was initially introduced from humans and has since evolved, most likely reflecting widespread circulation among mink in the beginning of the infection period several weeks prior to detection. Despite enhanced biosecurity, early warning surveillance and immediate culling of infected farms, transmission occurred between mink farms in three big transmission clusters with unknown modes of transmission. Sixty-eight percent (68%) of the tested mink farm residents, employees and/or contacts had evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Where whole genomes were available, these persons were infected with strains with an animal sequence signature, providing evidence of animal to human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within mink farms.","Oude Munnink, Bas B; Sikkema, Reina S; Nieuwenhuijse, David F; Molenaar, Robert Jan; Munger, Emmanuelle; Molenkamp, Richard; van der Spek, Arco; Tolsma, Paulien; Rietveld, Ariene; Brouwer, Miranda; Bouwmeester-Vincken, Noortje; Harders, Frank; Hakze-van der Honing, Renate; Wegdam-Blans, Marjolein C A; Bouwstra, Ruth J; GeurtsvanKessel, Corine; van der Eijk, Annemiek A; Velkers, Francisca C; Smit, Lidwien A M; Stegeman, Arjan; van der Poel, Wim H M; Koopmans, Marion P G",Science (Wash.),,476

424696,Changes in the Surgical Training Program in the COVID-19 era,2020,"Infection with SARS-CoV-2 can lead to Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) and result in severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Recent reports indicate an increased rate of fungal coinfections during COVID-19. With incomplete understanding of the pathogenesis and without any causative therapy available, secondary infections may be detrimental to the prognosis. We monitored 11 COVID-19 patients with ARDS for their immune phenotype, plasma cytokines, and clinical parameters on the day of ICU admission and on day 4 and day 7 of their ICU stay. Whole blood stimulation assays with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), heat-killed Listeria monocytogenes (HKLM), Aspergillus fumigatus, and Candida albicans were used to mimic secondary infections, and changes in immune phenotype and cytokine release were assessed. COVID-19 patients displayed an immune phenotype characterized by increased HLA-DR+CD38+ and PD-1+ CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and elevated CD8+CD244+ lymphocytes, compared to healthy controls. Monocyte activation markers and cytokines IL-6, IL-8, TNF, IL-10, and sIL2R&#945; were elevated, corresponding to monocyte activation syndrome, while IL-1ß levels were low. LPS, HKLM and Aspergillus fumigatus antigen stimulation provoked an immune response that did not differ between COVID-19 patients and healthy controls, while COVID-19 patients showed an attenuated monocyte CD80 upregulation and abrogated release of IL-6, TNF, IL-1&#945;, and IL-1ß toward Candida albicans. This study adds further detail to the characterization of the immune response in critically ill COVID-19 patients and hints at an increased susceptibility for Candida albicans infection.","Moser, Dominique; Biere, Katharina; Han, Bing; Hoerl, Marion; Schelling, Gustav; Choukér, Alexander; Woehrle, Tobias",Front Immunol,,476

We sought to define the etiology, clinical presentation, time course and outcomes of children presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with cutaneous manifestations shortly after the first pandemic peak of COVID-19 in Spain. METHODS: Prospective, observational study in children <15 years of age evaluated for skin lesions in the ED of three pediatric hospitals. Children underwent a comprehensive work-up including SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and PCR, and serology and PCR tests for other viruses and bacteria. A one-month follow-up visit was conducted. RESULTS: From April 14 through May 8, 2020 we enrolled 62 children. Of those 34 had acro-ischemic skin lesions and 28 a variety of skin rashes. Overall 40% of children had mild systemic symptoms. Children with chilblains were older, had pain more frequently and more prolonged duration of skin lesions, while those with non-specific rashes had fever more frequently. Lesions were resolved in 75% of children at follow-up. Five patients demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and none tested positive by PCR. Three additional patients tested positive by PCR for rhinovirus, M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS: The number of ED visits for chilblains, which are rare in pediatrics, was high soon after the first peak of COVID-19 in Spain. The disease course was self-limited, outcomes were favorable and the possibility of viral transmission was negligible as all patients tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR.","Oliva Rodríguez-Pastor, Silvia; Martín Pedraz, Laura; Carazo Gallego, Begoña; Galindo Zavala, Rocío; Lozano Sánchez, Gema; de Toro Pseinado, Inmaculada; Rodriguez Benjumea, Margarita; Mejias, Asuncion; Cuadros, Esmeralda Núñez",Pediatr. int,,476

The management of the disease is mostly supportive, and respiratory failure from acute respiratory distress syndrome is the leading cause of death in a significant proportion of affected patients. Preliminary data point out that dramatic increase in IL-6 and subsequent cytokine release syndrome may account for the development of fatal interstitial pneumonia. Inhibition of IL-6 by blocking its specific receptor with monoclonal antibodies has been advocated as a promising attempt. Here we assess the potential utility of myo-Inositol, a polyol already in use for treating the newborn Respiratory Distress Syndrome, in downregulating the inflammatory response upon Sars-CoV-2 infection. Myo-Inositol proved to reduce IL-6 levels in a number of conditions and to mitigate the inflammatory cascade, while being devoid of any significant side effects.

Dysfunction of ACE2 leads to abnormal activation of the renin-angiotensin system and a systemic endotheliitis that may relate to abnormal coagulation and sepsis. Meanwhile, innate immune response and inflammation activation participate in dysfunctional coagulation. Previous research indicated that dysfunctional coagulation was one of the important risk factors accountable for a high risk of severe disease and death in patients with COVID-19. Understanding the possible mechanisms of dysfunctional coagulation and appropriate anticoagulation therapeutic strategies are important to prevent disease deterioration and reduce fatality rates during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Wang, Jie; Saguner, Ardan M; An, Jiaqi; Ning, Yuye; Yan, Yang; Li, Guoliang",Adv Ther,,476

Increased testing capacity and ample intensive care availability could explain lower mortality in some countries compared to others. Nevertheless, it is also plausible that the SARS-CoV-2 mutations giving rise to different phylogenetic clades are responsible for the apparent death rate disparities around the world. Current research literature linking the genetic make-up of SARS-CoV-2 with fatalities is lacking. Here, we suggest that this disparity in fatality rates may be attributed to SARS-CoV-2 evolving mutations and urge the international community to begin addressing the phylogenetic clade classification of SARS-CoV-2 in relation to clinical outcomes.","Eaaswarkhanth, Muthukrishnan; Al Madhoun, Ashraf; Al-Mulla, Fahd",Int J Infect Dis,,476

426539,Impact of COVID 19 on red flag discussions for haematological malignancies within the belfast trust,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Early differentiation between emergency department (ED) patients with and without corona virus disease (COVID-19) is very important. Chest CT scan may be helpful in early diagnosing of COVID-19. We investigated the diagnostic accuracy of CT using RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 as reference standard and investigated reasons for discordant results between the two tests. METHODS: In this prospective single centre study in the Netherlands, all adult symptomatic ED patients had both a CT scan and a RT-PCR upon arrival at the ED. CT results were compared with PCR test(s). Diagnostic accuracy was calculated. Discordant results were investigated using discharge diagnoses. RESULTS: Between March 13th and March 24th 2020, 193 symptomatic ED patients were included. In total, 43.0% of patients had a positive PCR and 56.5% a positive CT, resulting in a sensitivity of 89.2%, specificity 68.2%, likelihood ratio (LR)+ 2.81 and LR- 0.16. Sensitivity was higher in patients with high risk pneumonia (CURB-65 score &#8805;3; n = 17, 100%) and with sepsis (SOFA score &#8805;2; n = 137, 95.5%). Of the 35 patients (31.8%) with a suspicious CT and a negative RT-PCR, 9 had another respiratory viral pathogen, and in 7 patients, COVID-19 was considered likely. One of nine patients with a non-suspicious CT and a positive PCR had developed symptoms within 48 hours before scanning. DISCUSSION: The accuracy of chest CT in symptomatic ED patients is high, but used as a single diagnostic test, CT can not safely diagnose or exclude COVID-19. However, CT can be used as a quick tool to categorize patients into ""probably positive"" and ""probably negative"" cohorts.","Gietema, Hester A; Zelis, Noortje; Nobel, J Martijn; Lambriks, Lars J G; van Alphen, Lieke B; Oude Lashof, Astrid M L; Wildberger, Joachim E; Nelissen, Irene C; Stassen, Patricia M",PLoS One,,476

426836,Covid-19 in New Zealand and the Pacific: implications for children and families,2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread rapidly throughout the whole world and caused significant difficulties in the prevention and control of the epidemic. In this case, several detection methods have been established based on nucleic acid diagnostic techniques and immunoassays to achieve sensitive and specific detection of SARS-CoV-2. However, most methods are still largely dependent on professional instruments, highly trained operators, and centralized laboratories. These limitations gravely diminish their practicality and portability. Herein, a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) Cas12a based assay was developed for portable, rapid and sensitive of SARS-CoV-2. In this assay, samples were quickly pretreated and amplified by reverse transcription recombinase-aided amplification under mild conditions. Then, by combining the CRISPR Cas12a system and a glucose-producing reaction, the signal of the virus was converted to that of glucose, which can be quantitatively read by a personal glucose meter in a few seconds. Nucleocapsid protein gene was tested as a model target, and the sensitivity for quantitative detection was as low as 10 copies/µl, which basically meet the needs of clinical diagnosis. In addition, with the advantages of lower material cost, shorter detection time, and no requirement for professional instrument in comparison with quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, this assay is expected to provide a powerful technical support for the early diagnosis and intervention during epidemic prevention and control.","Huang, Di; Shi, Zhuwei; Qian, Jiajie; Bi, Ke; Fang, Mengjun; Xu, Zhinan",Biotechnol. bioeng,,476
426837,Covid-19 in New Zealand and the Pacific: implications for children and families,2021,"Fifty-eight percent of the total infections in Italy of COVID-19 were found in northern Italy, in particular, Lombardy. From February 21, 2020, to March 23, 2020, 20 patients with a fracture and a diagnosis of COVID-19 were hospitalized. Demographic data, COVID-19 symptoms, laboratory and radiographic examinations, and treatment methods were recorded. At 1-month follow-up, patients were assessed with the SF-36 score. This case series includes 20 patients (16 women and 4 men), with an average age of 82.35 years (range 59-95). Eleven patients (55%) had a femur fracture. Fourteen patients (70%) had 3 or more comorbidities or previous pathologies. Three patients with severe comorbidities died during the hospitalization. Thirteen patients (65%) had fever, 18 patients (90%) asthenia, and 17 patients (85%) dyspnea. All patients (100%) were given antibiotic therapy, whereas 16 patients (80%) underwent hydroxychloroquine therapy and 8 (40%) were treated with corticosteroids. Eighteen patients (90%) underwent antithromboembolic prophylaxis. Eighteen patients (90%) had lymphopenia. All 20 patients (100%) required noninvasive mechanical ventilation. High D-dimer and polymerase chain reaction values were found in all patients (100%), whereas lactate dehydrogenase was increased in 18 patients (90%). Patients with fractures, especially in the lower limbs, frequently require hospitalization, making these patients more subjected to the risk of COVID-19 infection. COVID-19 infection therefore does not seem to influence the fracture pattern in the elderly population but can lead to health deterioration with increased mortality. The typical symptoms of COVID-19 disease have not changed when associated with a fracture or trauma. Laboratory data are in line with what is reported in recent studies, whereas a more invasive assisted ventilation is associated with a poor prognosis. Finally, analyzing the data obtained from the SF-36 score, significantly lower values emerged when compared with those reported in the literature. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE:: Prognostic Level IV.

Using the polyhedral mesh as control net, recursive subdivision algorithms often yield poor shape for these non-quad configurations. Polynomial surface constructions such as geometrically smooth splines (G-splines) do better, but lack subdivision-like refinability. Such refinability is useful for hierarchical modeling and engineering analysis. This paper introduces a new class of G-splines that generalizes bi-quadratic C 1 splines to polyhedral control nets with star- and T-configurations and that is refinable.","Karciauskas, KÈ©stutis; Peters, Jörg",Comput Graph,,476
428018,"Please, Reboot – Small Economies and the WTO Appellate Mechanism in Times of Trade War and COVID-19",2020,"To contain the spread of CoV-19 / SARS-CoV-2 infection, several governments have imposed collective quarantine on the population. All of these restrictions have influenced women's health and induced an unhealthy lifestyle that, in some cases, could persist after the lockdown. The present commentary briefly analyzes the effects of quarantine on women's lifestyle. Quarantine is associated with stress and depression, which lead to unhealthy nutrition and reduced physical activity, particularly in women. Unhealthy diet is usually poor in fruit and vegetables, with a consequent low intake of antioxidants and vitamins. However, vitamins have recently been identified as a weapon in the fight against the Covid-19. Some reports suggest that Vitamin D could exert a protective effect on such infection. In addition, women are less likely to engage in regular physical activity and have increased sitting time and sedentary behaviors during quarantine, which have led to weight gain. During quarantine strategies to increase home-based physical activity and to encourage adherence to a healthy diet have been implemented. Following quarantine, a global action supporting healthy Diet and physical activity is mandatory to encourage women to return to a good lifestyle routine.","Mattioli, Anna Vittoria; Toni, Silvia; Coppi, Francesca; Farinetti, Alberto",Acta Biomed,,476

Weekly average completion proportion of standardized documentation used by a team of neurologists for adult patients for the diagnosis of epilepsy, seizure classification, and frequency were analyzed. By December 15, 2019, a 94% average weekly completion proportion of standardized epilepsy care documentation was achieved that was maintained through May 31, 2020. Moreover, during the period of predominately telemedicine encounters in response to the pandemic, the completion proportion was 90%.

Our aim was to identify predictive factors of PE in non-ICU hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Data and outcomes were collected upon admission during a French multicenter retrospective study, including patients hospitalized for COVID-19, with a CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) performed in the emergency department for suspected PE. Predictive factors significantly associated with PE were identified through a multivariate regression model. RESULTS: A total of 88 patients (median [IQR] age of 68 years [60-78]) were analyzed. Based on CTPA, 47 (53.4%) patients were diagnosed with PE, and 41 were not. D-dimer &#8805;3000 ng/mL (OR 8.2 [95% CI] 1.3-74.2, sensitivity (Se) 0.84, specificity (Sp) 0.78, P = .03), white blood count (WBC) &#8805;12.0 G/L (29.5 [2.3-1221.2], Se 0.47, Sp 0.92, P = .02), and ferritin &#8805;480 µg/L (17.0 [1.7-553.3], Se 0.96, Sp 0.44, P = .03) were independently associated with the PE diagnosis. The presence of the double criterion D-dimer &#8805;3000 ng/mL and WBC &#8805;12.0 G/L was greatly associated with PE (OR 21.4 [4.0-397.9], P = .004). CONCLUSION: The white blood count, the D-dimer and ferritin levels could be used as an indication for CTPA to confirm PE on admission in non-ICU COVID-19 patients.","Galland, Joris; Thoreau, Benjamin; Delrue, Maxime; Neuwirth, Marie; Stepanian, Alain; Chauvin, Anthony; Dellal, Azeddine; Nallet, Olivier; Roriz, Melanie; Devaux, Mathilde; London, Jonathan; Martin-Lecamp, Gonzague; Froissart, Antoine; Arab, Nouara; Ferron, Bertrand; Groff, Marie-Helene; Queyrel, Viviane; Lorut, Christine; Regard, Lucile; Berthoux, Emilie; Bayer, Guillaume; Comarmond, Chloe; Lioger, Bertrand; Mekinian, Arsène; Szwebel, Tali-Anne; Sené, Thomas; Amador-Boreiro, Blanca; Mangin, Olivier; Sellier, Pierre-Olivier; Mouly, Stephane; Kevorkian, Jean-Philippe; Siguret, Virginie; Vodovar, Dominique; Sene, Damien",Eur J Haematol,,476

This issue may worsen due to the COVID-19 pandemic and may differentially affect vulnerable groups in the population, including children, adolescents, and young adults. The current study evaluated the association of affective variables (depression, hopelessness, and anxiety), drug use (alcohol, tobacco, and others), emotional intelligence, and attachment with suicidal behaviors. Methods: A state-wide survey included 8033 students (51% female, 49% male; mean age of 16 years) from science and technology high-schools using a standardized questionnaire that was distributed online. Multinomial logistic regression models tested associations between suicidal behaviors and several covariates. The analyses accommodated the complex structure of the sample. Results: Approximately 21% of all students reported a suicidal behavior (11% with a low-lethality suicide attempt, 6% with self-injuries, and 4% with a high-lethality suicide attempt). Variables associated with higher odds of suicidal behavior included: female sex, depression, hopelessness, anxiety, alcohol and tobacco use, childhood trauma, and having to self-rely as issues affecting attachment, and low self-esteem. Security of attachment was associated with lower odds of suicidal behavior. Conclusions: The complexity of suicidal behavior makes it clear that comprehensive programs need to be implemented.","Hermosillo-de-la-Torre, Alicia Edith; Arteaga-de-Luna, Stephania Montserrat; Acevedo-Rojas, Denise Liliana; Juárez-Loya, Angélica; Jiménez-Tapia, José Alberto; Pedroza-Cabrera, Francisco Javier; González-Forteza, Catalina; Cano, Manuel; Wagner, Fernando A",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,476

Once fatal in most infantile-onset cases, pre-symptomatic diagnosis through newborn screening (NBS) protocols, dietary management, and pharmacotherapy with nitisinone have improved outcomes. Succinylacetone provides a sensitive and specific marker for the detection of TT1 but is not universally utilized in screening protocols for the disease. Here, we report an infant transferred to our facility for evaluation and management of hyperinsulinism who subsequently developed acute-onset liver, respiratory, and renal failure around one month of life. She was found to have TT1 caused by novel pathogenic variant in fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (c.1014 delC, p.Cys 338 Ter). Her NBS, which utilized tyrosine as a primary marker, had been reported as normal, with a tyrosine level of 151 µmol/L (reference: < 280 µmol/L). Retrospective analysis of dried blood spot samples via tandem mass spectrometry showed detectable succinylacetone ranging 4.65-10.34 µmol/L. To our knowledge, this is the first patient with TT1 whose initial presenting symptom was hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. The case highlights the importance of maintaining a high suspicion for metabolic disease in critically ill children, despite normal NBS. We also use the case to advocate for NBS for TT1 using succinylacetone quantitation.","Priestley, Jessica R C; Alharbi, Hana; Callahan, Katharine Press; Guzman, Herodes; Payan-Walters, Irma; Smith, Ligia; Ficicioglu, Can; Ganetzky, Rebecca D; Ahrens-Nicklas, Rebecca C",,,476

430933,Covid-19 and the ink industry,2020,"A pandemic due to novel coronavirus arose in mid-December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and in 3 months' time swept the world. The disease has been referred to as COVID-19, and the causative agent has been labelled SARS-CoV-2 due to its genetic similarities to the virus (SARS-CoV-1) responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic nearly 20 years earlier. The spike proteins of both viruses dictate tissue tropism using the angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 (ACE-2) receptor to bind to cells. The ACE-2 receptor can be found in nervous system tissue and endothelial cells among the tissues of many other organs.Neurological complications have been observed with COVID-19. Myalgia and headache are relatively common, but serious neurological disease appears to be rare. No part of the neuraxis is spared. The neurological disorders occurring with COVID-19 may have many pathophysiological underpinnings. Some appear to be the consequence of direct viral invasion of the nervous system tissue, others arise as a postviral autoimmune process, and still others are the result of metabolic and systemic complications due to the associated critical illness. This review addresses the preliminary observations regarding the neurological disorders reported with COVID-19 to date and describes some of the disorders that are anticipated from prior experience with similar coronaviruses.","Berger, Joseph R",J Neurovirol,,476

Here, we discuss the presentation and outcomes of COVID in an ambulatory setting along with distribution of positive cases amongst healthcare workers (HCWs). METHOD: Patients who visited the COVID clinic between 03/11/2020 and 06/14/2020 were tested based on the CDC guidelines at the time using PCR-detection methods. Medical records were reviewed and captured on a RedCap database. Statistical analysis was performed using both univariate and bivariate analysis using Fischer's exact test with 2-sided P values. RESULTS: Of the 2471 evaluated patients, 846 (34.2%) tested positive for COVID. Mean age of positivity was 43.4 years (SD ± 15.4), 60.1% were female and 49% were Black. 58.7% of people tested had a known exposure, and amongst those with exposure, 57.3% tested positive. Ninety-four patients were hospitalized (11.1%), of which 22 patients (23.4%) required ICU admission and 10 patients died. The overall death rate of patients presenting to clinic was 0.4%, or 1.2% amongst positive patients. Median length of hospital stay was 6 days (range 1-51). Symptoms significantly associated with COVID included: anosmia, fever, change in taste, anorexia, myalgias, cough, chills, and fatigue. Increased risk of COVID occurred with diabetes, whereas individuals with lung disease or malignancy were not associated with increased risk of COVID. Amongst COVID positive HCWs, the majority were registered nurses (23.4%), most working in general medicine (39.8%) followed by critical care units (14.3%). DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Blacks and females had the highest infection rates. There was a broad range in presentation from those who are very ill and require hospitalization and those who remain ambulatory.

RECENT FINDINGS: Patients with asthma are neither at greater risk of becoming infected by SARS-CoV-2 nor they are at risk of complications of COVID-19 but those requiring frequent use of oral corticosteroid may be at greater risk. SUMMARY: In general, patients with asthma are not at risk of COVID-19 morbidity or mortality. On the contrary, patients with asthma may be at lower risk of hospitalizations during the COVID-19 pandemic. This may be related to asthma and its treatment, to patient's behavior, to the health system, and to collective changes in activities. It is likely that reduction in respiratory infections because of social distancing, face masks, and hand washing have a role in the reduction in asthma hospitalizations. Management of asthma in times of COVID-19 must be optimized, medication have to be used regularly and exacerbations detected early. Systemic corticosteroids may be used for control of severe asthma or severe exacerbations.

The number of ACE-2 receptors in salivary glands is higher than those expressed in the lungs. It was suggested that the salivary gland is a reservoir for Covid-19, especially in asymptomatic patients. ACE-2 receptors are also highly enriched on the tongue, gingiva, and the floor of the mouth. Viral RNA was also detected in saliva at high titers. The diagnosis of Covid-19 was proved using a nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab. Sampling specimens requires direct contact between medical personnel and patients;thereby, it can facilitate healthcare-associated infections. Specimens collected from this area causes discomfort for the patient and may cause a risk of bleeding. In addition, those swab specimens are not desirable for monitoring the viral load of Covid-19. In contrast, taking saliva specimens is easier to carry out by patients, as well as more comfortable and non-invasive. Thereby, it can potentially reduce the risk of transmission to medical personnel. Collected information suggested that saliva is a great potential candidate for Covid-19 diagnosis and monitoring. This review aims to collect information on the potential of saliva as a diagnostic tool for Covid-19 and the impact of its transmission.","Arinawati, D.

432054,Life in times of COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused patients to avoid seeking medical care. Provision of telemonitoring programs in addition to usual care has demonstrated improved effectiveness in managing patients with heart failure (HF). OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the potential clinical and health economic outcomes of a telemonitoring program for management of patients with HF during the COVID-19 pandemic from the perspective of health care providers in Hong Kong. METHODS: A Markov model was designed to compare the outcomes of a care under COVID-19 (CUC) group and a telemonitoring plus CUC group (telemonitoring group) in a hypothetical cohort of older patients with HF in Hong Kong. The model outcome measures were direct medical cost, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the model assumptions and the robustness of the base-case results. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, the telemonitoring group showed a higher QALY gain (1.9007) at a higher cost (US $15,888) compared to the CUC group (1.8345 QALYs at US $15,603). Adopting US $48,937/QALY (1 × the gross domestic product per capita of Hong Kong) as the willingness-to-pay threshold, telemonitoring was accepted as a highly cost-effective strategy, with an incremental cost-effective ratio of US $4292/QALY. No threshold value was identified in the deterministic sensitivity analysis. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, telemonitoring was accepted as cost-effective in 99.22% of 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the current outpatient care alone under the COVID-19 pandemic, the addition of telemonitoring-mediated management to the current care for patients with HF appears to be a highly cost-effective strategy from the perspective of health care providers in Hong Kong.","Jiang, Xinchan; Yao, Jiaqi; You, Joyce Hoi-Sze",J Med Internet Res,,476

The generated micro-droplets aerosols can travel up to 8 meters, stay suspended for long periods and preserve viral infectivity for a median of 2.7 hours. An unprotected person exposed to this cloud, might inhale a considerable amount of infectious viral doses, which will attach to the ACE 2 receptors on alveoli epithelium, resulting in infection. N95 respirators and surgical masks block 95% and 50-60% respectively of inhalable particles and protect the wearer from infection.

To prevent spread of COVID-19, tele-prescription was permitted temporarily. This study investigated the impact of tele-prescription on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) concentrations were retrospectively analyzed in patients with type 2 diabetes who were treated with tele-prescription because of COVID-19 and those who were treated by face-to-face care (non-tele-prescription group) enrolled at the same period of time. Mean HbA1c concentrations and mean change in HbA1c concentration (&#916;HbA1c) were compared in these two groups. RESULTS: The mean HbA1c levels of patients were significantly higher after than before the tele-prescription period (7.46% ± 1.24% vs. 7.27% ± 1.13%, p < 0.05). Mean &#916;HbA1c was significantly higher in the tele-prescription than in the non-tele-prescription group (0.19% ± 0.68% vs. 0.04% ± 0.95%, p < 0.05). HbA1c was significantly greater in patients taking fewer oral hypoglycemic agents, no insulin, fewer comorbidities (e.g., coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular accident, and diabetic neuropathy), and higher baseline HbA1c. CONCLUSION: Tele-prescription may worsen glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes during public health crises.","Park, Sung-Don; Kim, Na-Young; Jeon, Jae-Han; Kim, Jung-Guk; Lee, In-Kyu; Park, Keun-Gyu; Choi, Yeon-Kyung",Korean J Intern Med,,476

To address these issues, the multi-omics sample preparation technique MPLEx (metabolite, protein, and lipid extraction) was developed to partition a single sample into three distinct parts (metabolites, proteins, and lipids) for multi-omics analysis, while simultaneously inactivating MERS-CoV by solubilizing and disrupting the viral envelope and denaturing viral proteins. Here we describe the MPLEx protocol, highlight the step of inactivation, and describe the details of downstream processing, instrumental analysis of the three separate analytes, and their subsequent informatics pipelines.","Nicora, Carrie D; Sims, Amy C; Bloodsworth, Kent J; Kim, Young-Mo; Moore, Ronald J; Kyle, Jennifer E; Nakayasu, Ernesto S; Metz, Thomas O",Methods Mol Biol,,476

Here, we used flow cytometry to assess the magnitude, function, and phenotype of SARS coronavirus 2-specific (SARS-CoV-2-specific) CD4+ T cells in 95 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 38 of them being HIV-1 and/or tuberculosis (TB) coinfected, and 38 non-COVID-19 patients. We showed that SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cell attributes, rather than magnitude, were associated with disease severity, with severe disease being characterized by poor polyfunctional potential, reduced proliferation capacity, and enhanced HLA-DR expression. Moreover, HIV-1 and TB coinfection skewed the SARS-CoV-2 T cell response. HIV-1-mediated CD4+ T cell depletion associated with suboptimal T cell and humoral immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, and a decrease in the polyfunctional capacity of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells was observed in COVID-19 patients with active TB. Our results also revealed that COVID-19 patients displayed reduced frequency of Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific CD4+ T cells, with possible implications for TB disease progression. These results corroborate the important role of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in COVID-19 pathogenesis and support the concept of altered T cell functions in patients with severe disease.","Riou, Catherine; du Bruyn, Elsa; Stek, Cari; Daroowala, Remy; Goliath, Rene T; Abrahams, Fatima; Said-Hartley, Qonita; Allwood, Brian W; Hsiao, Nei-Yuan; Wilkinson, Katalin A; Arlehamn, Cecilia S Lindestam; Sette, Alessandro; Wasserman, Sean; Wilkinson, Robert J",J. clin. invest,,476

The degradation of bisphenol A, diclofenac and caffeine was predominantly contributed by chlorination (>60%), direct UV photolysis (>80%) and radical oxidation (>90%), respectively, during the treatment by the UV-LED/chlorine AOP at three tested UV wavelengths (i.e., 265, 285 and 300 nm). The most effective UV wavelengths for the degradation of bisphenol A, diclofenac and caffeine were 265, 285 and 300 nm, respectively. The degradation of all the three micropollutants was enhanced with increasing pH from 6 to 8, though the reasons for the pH dependence were different. The residues of the micropollutants and their degradation (by)products were removed by post-adsorption using granular activated carbon (GAC). Interestingly and more importantly, the adsorption rates of the degradation (by)products were 2-3 times higher than the adsorption rates of the corresponding micropollutants, indicating the formation of more adsorbable (by)products after the AOP pre-treatment. The UV-LED/chlorine AOP followed by GAC adsorption provides a multi-barrier treatment system for enhancing micropollutant removal in potable water. The findings also suggest the merit of the sequential use of UV-LEDs followed by GAC in treating chlorine-containing potable water in small-scale water treatment systems (e.g., point-of-use or point-of-entry water purifiers).","Yin, Ran; Shang, Chii",Water Res,,476

Data from several countries have demonstrated higher morbidity and mortality among individuals with chronic metabolic diseases such as diabetes mellitus (DM). In this review, we explore the contributing factors for poorer prognosis in these individuals. As a significant proportion of patients with COVID-19 also have DM, this adds another layer of complexity to their management. We explore potential interactions between anti-diabetic medications and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system inhibitors with COVID-19. Suggested recommendations for the use of anti-diabetic medications in COVID-19 patients with DM are provided. We also review pertinent clinical considerations in the management of diabetic ketoacidosis in the COVID-19 patient. In addition, we aim to increase the awareness of clinicians to the metabolic effects of promising drug therapies for COVID-19. Finally, we highlight the importance of timely vaccinations for patients with DM.","Chee, Ying Jie; Tan, Seng Kiong; Yeoh, Ester",J. diabetes investig. (Online),,476

Independent (non-sponsored) studies have a great potential to enhance public confidence in vaccines and accelerate their uptake process. Methods: A nationwide cross-sectional study for the side effects (SE) of CoronaVac was carried out in February 2021 among Turkish healthcare workers who were recently vaccinated. The questionnaire inquired about local and systemic SEs that occurred in the short-term, within four weeks, following vaccination. Results: A total of 780 healthcare workers were included in this study;62.5% of them experienced at least one SE. Injection site pain (41.5%) was the most common local SE, while fatigue (23.6%), headache (18.7%), muscle pain (11.2%) and joint pain (5.9%) were the common systemic SEs. Female healthcare workers (67.9%) were significantly more affected by local and systemic SEs than male colleagues (51.4%). Younger age, previous infection, and compromised health status (chronic illnesses and regular medicines uptake) can be associated with an increased risk of CoronaVac SEs;Conclusions: The independent research shows a higher prevalence of CoronaVac SEs than what is reported by phase I–III clinical trials. In general, the results of this study confirm the overall safety of CoronaVac and suggest potential risk factors for its SEs. Gender-based differences and SEs distribution among age groups are worth further investigation.","Abanoub, Riad Sağıroğlu Derya amp; Uuml,; stün, Batuhan Pokorná Andrea Klugarová Jitka Attia Sameh Klugar Miloslav",Journal of Clinical Medicine,,476

Even when interventions produce the desired outcomes in attitudes, it is often challenging to translate those psychological changes into subsequent behaviors. Previous research has shown that elaboration (amount of thinking) is a critical construct for understanding the ability of attitudes to guide behavior. Instead of looking directly at objective elaboration, this study examined attitude-behavior correspondence as a function of subjective elaboration. METHOD: Participants were first randomly assigned to generate positive or negative arguments with regard to taxing junk food. After this experimental manipulation, participants reported their subjective elaboration (as an additional predictor), and their attitudes and behavioral intentions regarding the proposal (as dependent measures). RESULTS: As hypothesized, the results showed that the greater perceived elaboration, the larger the ability of attitudes to guide behavioral intentions. That is, attitudes were more predictive of behavioral intentions in participants with higher levels of perceived elaboration compared to those with relatively lower levels of subjective thinking.

Despite the shutdown measures being in place, northern China still suffered severe haze episodes (HE) that are not yet fully understood, particularly how the source emissions changed. Thus, the meteorological conditions and source emissions in processing five HEs occurred in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area were investigated by analyzing a comprehensive real-time measurement dataset including air quality data, particle physics, optical properties, chemistry, aerosol lidar remote sensing, and meteorology. Three HEs recorded before the shutdown began were related to accumulated primary pollutants and secondary aerosol formation under unfavorable dispersion conditions. The common ""business as usual"" emissions from local primary sources in this highly polluted area exceeded the wintertime atmospheric diffusive capacity to disperse them. Thus, an intensive haze formed under these adverse meteorological conditions such as in the first HE, with coal combustion to be the predominant source. Positive responses to the shutdown measures were demonstrated by reduced contributions from traffic and dust during the final two HEs that overlapped the Spring and Lantern Festivals, respectively. Local meteorological dispersion during the Spring Festival was the poorest among the five HEs. Increased residential burning plus fireworks emissions contributed to the elevated PM2.5 with the potential of enhancing the HEs. Our results highlight that reductions from shutdown measures alone do not prevent the occurrence of HEs. To further reduce air pollution and thus improve public health, abatement strategies with an emphasis on residential burning are needed.","Dai, Qili; Ding, Jing; Hou, Linlu; Li, Linxuan; Cai, Ziying; Liu, Baoshuang; Song, Congbo; Bi, Xiaohui; Wu, Jianhui; Zhang, Yufen; Feng, Yinchang; Hopke, Philip K",Environ Pollut,,476
439020,Dynamic Terminology Integration for COVID-19 and other Emerging Domains,2021-09-10,"Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can result in pneumonia and acute respiratory failure. Accumulation of mucus in the airways is a hallmark of the disease and can result in hypoxemia. Here, we show that quantitative proteome analysis of the sputum from severe patients with COVID-19 reveal high levels of neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) components, which was confirmed by microscopy. Extracellular DNA from excessive NET formation can increase sputum viscosity and lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Recombinant human DNase (Pulmozyme; Roche) has been shown to be beneficial in reducing sputum viscosity and improve lung function. We treated five patients pwith COVID-19 resenting acute symptoms with clinically approved aerosolized Pulmozyme. No adverse reactions to the drug were seen, and improved oxygen saturation and recovery in all severely ill patients with COVID-19 was observed after therapy. Immunofluorescence and proteome analysis of sputum and blood plasma samples after treatment revealed a marked reduction of NETs and a set of statistically significant proteome changes that indicate reduction of hemorrhage, plasma leakage and inflammation in the airways, and reduced systemic inflammatory state in the blood plasma of patients. Taken together, the results indicate that NETs contribute to acute respiratory failure in COVID-19 and that degrading NETs may reduce dependency on external high-flow oxygen therapy in patients. Targeting NETs using recombinant human DNase may have significant therapeutic implications in COVID-19 disease and warrants further studies.","Fisher, Jane; Mohanty, Tirthankar; Karlsson, Christofer A Q; Khademi, S M Hossein; Malmström, Erik; Frigyesi, Attila; Nordenfelt, Pontus; Malmstrom, Johan; Linder, Adam",Mol Cell Proteomics,,476

439617,Reliability of the hebrew version of the integrated covid-19 threat scale,2020,"Globally, the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is resulting in high fatality rates. Consequently, the prevention of further transmission is very vital. Until vaccines are widely available, the only available infection prevention methods include the following: contact tracing, case isolation and quarantine, social (physical) distancing, and hygiene measures (washing of hands with soap and water and using alcohol-based hand sanitizers). Contact tracing, which is key in preventing the spread of COVID-19, refers to the process of finding unreported people who maybe infected by using a verified case to trace back possible infections of contacts. Consequently, the wide and fast spread of COVID-19 requires computational approaches which utilize innovative algorithms that build a memory of proximity contacts of cases that are positive. In this paper, a recommender algorithm called socially aware recommendation of people probably infected with COVID-19 (SARPPIC) is proposed. SARPPIC initially utilizes betweenness centrality in a social network to measure the number of target contact points (nodes/users) who have come into contact with an infected contact point (COVID-19 patient). Then, using contact durations and contact frequencies, tie strengths of the same contact points above are also computed. Finally, the above algorithmic computations are hybridized through profile integration to generate results for effective contact tracing recommendations of possible COVID-19-infected patients who will require testing in a healthcare facility. Benchmarking experimental results in the paper demonstrate that, using two interconnected relevant real-world datasets, SARPPIC outperforms other relevant methods in terms of suitable evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F-measure.","Asabere, Nana Yaw; Acakpovi, Amevi; Ofori, Emmanuel Kwaku; Torgby, Wisdom; Kuuboore, Marcellinus; Lawson, Gare; Adjaloko, Edward",Comput Math Methods Med,,476
439991,Pemulihan Fungsi Alam Pariwisata Ditengah Pandemi COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: In 2019, with the COVID-19 pandemic sweeping across the globe, public health systems worldwide faced severe challenges. Amid the pandemic, one simulation game, Plague Inc., has received substantial attention. This game has indirectly drawn greater public attention to public health issues by simulating pathogen transmission and disease symptoms. OBJECTIVE: Against this backdrop, this research investigates whether the gameful experience of Plague Inc. has indirectly affected public knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) regarding COVID-19. METHODS: An online survey was conducted through social networking services in Taiwan from May 6-28, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 486 subjects participated in this study, of which 276 (56.8%) had played Plague Inc. This study had several findings. First, participants who had played Plague Inc. demonstrated higher levels of knowledge (P=.03, median 7, IQR 7-8) and attitudes (P=.007, median 8, IQR 7-8) than participants who had not played Plague Inc. (knowledge: median 7, IQR 6-8; attitude: median 7, IQR 6-8). Second, there was a significant correlation between creative thinking (&#961;=.127, P=.04) and dominance (&#961;=.122, P=.04) in attitude. Finally, there was a significant correlation between creative thinking (&#961;=.126, P<.001) and dominance (&#961;=.119, P=.049) in practice. CONCLUSIONS: Serious games highlighting the theme of pathogen transmission may enhance public knowledge and attitudes regarding COVID-19. Furthermore, the creative thinking and dominance involved in gameful experiences may act as critical factors in public attitudes and practices regarding COVID-19. These findings should be further verified through experimental research in the future.","Peng, Li-Hsun; Bai, Ming-Han",JMIR Serious Games,,476

The existing literature is limited. OBJECTIVE(S): To develop a robust, reliable and valid methodology to evaluate distribution and persistence of dental aerosol and splatter, including the evaluation of clinical procedures. METHODS: Fluorescein was introduced into the irrigation reservoirs of a high-speed air-turbine, ultrasonic scaler and 3-in-1 spray, and procedures were performed on a mannequin in triplicate. Filter papers were placed in the immediate environment. The impact of dental suction and assistant presence were also evaluated. Samples were analysed using photographic image analysis and spectrofluorometric analysis. Descriptive statistics were calculated and Pearson's correlation for comparison of analytic methods. RESULTS: All procedures were aerosol and splatter generating. Contamination was highest closest to the source, remaining high to 1-1.5 m. Contamination was detectable at the maximum distance measured (4 m) for high-speed air-turbine with maximum relative fluorescence units (RFU) being: 46,091 at 0.5 m, 3,541 at 1.0 m and 1,695 at 4 m. There was uneven spatial distribution with highest levels of contamination opposite the operator. Very low levels of contamination (&#8804;0.1% of original) were detected at 30 and 60 minutes post-procedure. Suction reduced contamination by 67-75% at 0.5-1.5 m.

To investigate the association of the pandemic-related impacts with the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among patients with melanoma during the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted a cross-sectional study among Chinese patients with melanoma. A self-administered online questionnaire was distributed to melanoma patients through social media. Demographic and clinical data, and pandemic-related impacts (unemployment and income loss) were collected. HRQoL was determined by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) and its disease-specific module (the melanoma subscale, MS). A total of 135 patients with melanoma completed the study. The mean age of the patients was 55.8 ± 14.2 years, 48.1% (65/135) were male, and 17.04% (34/135) were unemployed since the epidemic.

The efficiency of infection with SARS-CoV-2 is reflected by its rapid global spread. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has implications for patients with inflammatory skin diseases on systemic immunotherapy who may be at increased risk of infection or more severe infection. This position paper is a focused examination of current evidence considering the mechanisms of action of immunotherapeutic drugs in relation to immune response to SARS-CoV-2. We aim to provide practical guidance for dermatologists managing patients with inflammatory skin conditions on systemic therapies during the current pandemic and beyond. Considering the limited and rapidly evolving evidence, mechanisms of action of therapies, and current knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we propose that systemic immunotherapy can be continued, with special considerations for at risk patients or those presenting with symptoms.","Beecker, J; Papp, K A; Dutz, J; Vender, R B; Gniadecki, R; Cooper, C; Gisondi, P; Gooderham, M; Hong, C H; Kirchhof, M G; Lynde, C W; Maari, C; Poulin, Y; Puig, L",J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol,,476

We aimed to assess physicians' attitude among different medical specialties towards this sudden and unexpected shift of traditional face-to-face meetings into webinars, and to suggest future recommendations. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, internet-based survey study using a 25-item questionnaire, from November 1 and November 15, 2020. The survey was created and distributed to physicians from different medical and surgical specialties and from different countries via several social media platforms, using a snowball technique. RESULTS: A total of 326 physicians responded; 165 (50.6%) were females, mean age of responders was 38.7 ± 7.5 years. The majority of responses (93.2%) came from Arab countries. Of them, 195 (59.8%) reported attending more webinars compared to the same period last year, with average of 3 per month. As regard to the general impression; 244 (74.8%) were ""strongly satisfied"" or ""satisfied"", with the most satisfaction for ""training courses: by 268 (82.2%), and ""International conferences"" by 218 (66.9%). However, 246 respondents (75.5%) felt overwhelmed with the number and frequency of webinars during the pandemic, 171 (52.5%) reported attending less than 25% of webinars they are invited to, 205 (62.8%) disagreed that webinars can replace in-person meetings after the pandemic, and 239 (73.3%) agreed that online meetings need proper regulations. CONCLUSIONS: Webinars comprised a major avenue for education during COVID-19 pandemic, with initial general satisfaction among physicians. However, this paradigm shift was sudden and lacked proper regulations. Despite initial satisfaction, the majority of physicians felt overwhelmed with the number and frequency of webinars. Physicians' satisfaction is crucial in planning future educational activities, and considering that this current crisis will most likely have long lasting effects, webinars should be viewed as complementing traditional in-person methods, rather than replacement. In this study, we are suggesting recommendations to help future regulation of this change.","Ismail, Ismail Ibrahim; Abdelkarim, Ahmed; Al-Hashel, Jasem Y",PLoS One,,476

Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX) was used to generate aptamers (nucleic acids selected for high binding affinity to a target) to the RBD made from 2-fluoroarabinonucleic acid (FANA). The best selected ~ 79 nucleotide aptamers bound the RBD (Arg319-Phe541) and the larger S1 domain (Val16-Arg685) of the 1272 amino acid S protein with equilibrium dissociation constants (KD,app) of ~ 10-20 nM and a binding half-life for the RBD of 53 {+/-} 18 minutes. Aptamers inhibited the binding of the RBD to ACE2 in an ELISA assay. Inhibition, on a per weight basis, was similar to neutralizing antibodies that were specific for RBD. Aptamers demonstrated high specificity, binding with about 10-fold lower affinity to the related S1 domain from the original SARS virus, which also binds to ACE2. Overall, FANA aptamers show affinities comparable to previous DNA aptamers to RBD and S protein and directly block receptor interactions while using an alternative Xeno-nucleic acid (XNA) platform.","Ferreira-Bravo, Irani Alves; DeStefano, Jeffrey J.",,,476

Over the past two decades, the role of endoscopes has evolved from a diagnostic tool in the office to the operating room, where Hopkins rod and distal chip scopes are being used to perform routine and complex middle ear and mastoid surgery. Advancements in endoscopic ear surgery techniques have increased interest in endoscopes for in-office otologic procedures. Compared with binocular microscopy, the endoscope provides enhanced depth of field and visualization of the hidden recesses of the middle ear (and mastoid) using small surgical corridors. These advantages are leveraged in the office setting for diagnosing, documenting and managing otologic pathology, even more now during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this review, we describe the indications, techniques and potential complications of office-based otoendoscopy and endoscopic ear surgery.","Garcia, Alejandro Ridge Sarah E.; Garcia, Juan M.; Cohen, Michael Lee Daniel J.",Operative Techniques in Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,,476

Accompanying them through existential crises, disease, dying, and death is highly demanding. A situation which employees can experience as particularly stressful is when a decision needs to be made and they find themselves in a moral conflict or dilemma. Arguments: Such situations range from extremely rare triage decisions to comparably ""everyday"" involvement in (alleged) medical error. Conclusion: In some cases the outcome for patients and their families, who had placed their trust in the institution, can be tragic, and this already burdensome situation for employees is further exacerbated when there is no credible concept established within the organization for dealing with such events in a structured manner, and when colleagues and their superiors have little to no knowledge about helpful support options.","Schmidt, Kurt W",Ethik Med,,476

443244,When there is a will there is a way: The role of proactive personality in combating COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: As a result of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), there have been widespread changes in healthcare access. We conducted a retrospective population-based study in Alberta, Canada (population 4.4 million), where there have been approximately 1550 hospital admissions for COVID-19, to determine the impact of COVID-19 on hospital admissions and emergency department (ED visits), following initiation of a public health emergency act on March 15, 2020. METHODS: We used multivariable negative binomial regression models to compare daily numbers of medical/surgical hospital admissions via the ED between March 16-September 23, 2019 (pre COVID-19) and March 16-September 23, 2020 (post COVID-19 public health measures). We compared the most frequent diagnoses for hospital admissions pre/post COVID-19 public health measures. A similar analysis was completed for numbers of daily ED visits for any reason with a particular focus on ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSC). FINDINGS: There was a significant reduction in both daily medical (incident rate ratio (IRR) 0.86, p<0.001) and surgical (IRR 0.82, p<0.001) admissions through the ED in Alberta post COVID-19 public health measures. There was a significant decline in daily ED visits (IRR 0.65, p<0.001) including ACSC (IRR 0.75, p<0.001). The most common medical/surgical diagnoses for hospital admissions did not vary substantially pre and post COVID-19 public health measures, though there was a significant reduction in admissions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and a significant increase in admissions for mental and behavioral disorders due to use of alcohol. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a relatively low volume of COVID-19 hospital admissions in Alberta, there was an extensive impact on our healthcare system with fewer admissions to hospital and ED visits. This work generates hypotheses around causes for reduced hospital admissions and ED visits which warrant further investigation. As most publicly funded health systems struggle with health-system capacity routinely, understanding how these reductions can be safely sustained will be critical.","Rennert-May, Elissa; Leal, Jenine; Thanh, Nguyen Xuan; Lang, Eddy; Dowling, Shawn; Manns, Braden; Wasylak, Tracy; Ronksley, Paul E",PLoS One,,476

The coronavirus pandemic further highlights the importance of post-viral olfactory dysfunction. Currently, a comprehensive review of the neural mechanism underpinning post-viral olfactory dysfunction is lacking. OBJECTIVES: To synthesize the existing primary literature related to olfactory dysfunction secondary to viral infection, detail the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, highlight relevance for the current COVID-19 pandemic, and identify high impact areas of future research. METHODS: PubMed and Embase were searched to identify studies reporting primary scientific data on post-viral olfactory dysfunction. Results were supplemented by manual searches. Studies were categorized into animal and human studies for final analysis and summary. RESULTS: A total of 38 animal studies and 7 human studies met inclusion criteria and were analyzed. There was significant variability in study design, experimental model, and outcome measured. Viral effects on the olfactory system varies significantly based on viral substrain but generally include damage or alteration in components of the olfactory epithelium and/or the olfactory bulb. CONCLUSIONS: The mechanism of post-viral olfactory dysfunction is highly complex, virus-dependent, and involves a combination of insults at multiple levels of the olfactory pathway. This will have important implications for future diagnostic and therapeutic developments for patients infected with COVID-19.","Lee, Jason C; Nallani, Rohit; Cass, Lauren; Bhalla, Vidur; Chiu, Alexander G; Villwock, Jennifer A",Am J Rhinol Allergy,,476

Though data exist on the positivity rate of the SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test as well as COVID-19-related deaths amongst HCWs in South Africa, the overall infection rate remains underestimated by these indicators. It is also unclear whether the humoral immune response after SARS-CoV-2 infection offers durable protection against reinfection. This study will assess the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence amongst HCWs in the Eastern Cape (EC) and examine the longitudinal changes (rate of decay) in the antibody levels after infection in this cohort. Using a multi-stage cluster sampling of healthcare workers in selected health facilities in the EC, a cross-sectional study of 2250 participants will be recruited. In order to assess the community infection rate, 750 antenatal women in the same settings will be recruited. Relevant demographic and clinical characteristics will be obtained by a self-administered questionnaire. A chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) will be used for the qualitative detection of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. A nested cohort study will be conducted by performing eight-weekly antibody assays (X2) from 201 participants who tested positive for both SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and serology. Logistic regression models will be fitted to identify the independent risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The cumulative SARS-CoV-2 infection rate and infection fatality rate among the frontline HCWs will be estimated. In addition, the study will highlight the overall effectiveness of infection prevention and control measures (IPC) per exposure sites/wards at the selected health facilities.

DESIGN: We conducted a scoping review of the literature. SRs with or without meta-analysis (MA) that evaluated clinical data, outcomes or treatments for patients with COVID-19 were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We extracted quality characteristics guided by A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews-2 to calculate a qualitative score. Complementary evaluation of the most prominent published limitations affecting the COVID-19 body of evidence was performed. RESULTS: A total of 63 SRs were included. The majority were judged as a critically low methodological quality. Most of the studies were not guided by a pre-established protocol (39, 62%). More than half (39, 62%) failed to address risk of bias when interpreting their results. A comprehensive literature search strategy was reported in most SRs (54, 86%). Appropriate use of statistical methods was evident in nearly all SRs with MAs (39, 95%). Only 16 (33%) studies recognised heterogeneity in the definition of severe COVID-19 as a limitation of the study, and 15 (24%) recognised repeated patient populations as a limitation. CONCLUSION: The methodological and reporting quality of current COVID-19 SR is far from optimal.

The American Gastroenterological Association Institute Clinical Guideline Committee and Clinical Practice Updates Committee performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of international data on GI and liver manifestations of COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search to identify published and unpublished studies using OVID Medline and preprint servers (medRxiv, LitCovid, and SSRN [Social Science Research] up until April 5, 2020; major journal sites were monitored for US publications until April 19, 2020. We analyzed the prevalence of diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, as well as liver function tests abnormalities, using a fixed-effect model and assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) framework. RESULTS: We identified 118 studies and used a hierarchal study selection process to identify unique cohorts. We performed a meta-analysis of 47 studies including 10,890 unique patients. Pooled prevalence estimates of GI symptoms were as follows: diarrhea 7.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.2%-8.2%), nausea/vomiting 7.8% (95% CI, 7.1%-8.5%), and abdominal pain 2.7% (95% CI, 2.0%-3.4%). Most studies reported on hospitalized patients. The pooled prevalence estimates of elevated liver abnormalities were as follows: aspartate transaminase 15.0% (95% CI, 13.6%-16.5%) and alanine transaminase 15.0% (95% CI, 13.6%-16.4%). When analyzed comparing data from China to studies from countries other than China, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, and liver abnormalities were more prevalent outside of China, with diarrhea reported in 18.3% (95% CI, 16.6%-20.1%). Isolated GI symptoms were reported rarely. We also summarized the Gl and liver adverse effects of the most commonly utilized medications for COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: GI symptoms are associated with COVID-19 in <10% of patients. In studies outside of China, estimates are higher. Further studies are needed with standardized GI symptoms questionnaires and liver function test checks on admission to better quantify and qualify the association of these symptoms with COVID-19. Based on findings from our meta-analysis, we provide several Best Practice Statements for the consultative management of COVID-19.","Sultan, Shahnaz; Altayar, Osama; Siddique, Shazia M; Davitkov, Perica; Feuerstein, Joseph D; Lim, Joseph K; Falck-Ytter, Yngve; El-Serag, Hashem B",Gastroenterology,,476

Therefore, it is uncertain whether obesity is in fact associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes compared to non-obese individuals. We conducted a systematic search of PubMed (including MEDLINE) and Google Scholar on May 18, 2020 to identify published studies on COVID-19 outcomes in non-obese and obese patients, covering studies published during the first 6 months of the pandemic. Meta-analyses with random effects modeling was used to determine unadjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for various COVID-19 outcomes in obese versus non-obese patients. By quantitative analyses of 22 studies from 7 countries in North America, Europe, and Asia, we found that obesity is associated with an increased likelihood of presenting with more severe COVID-19 symptoms (OR 3.03, 95% CI 1.45-6.28, P = 0.003; 4 studies, n = 974), developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS; OR 2.89, 95% CI 1.14-7.34, P = 0.025; 2 studies, n = 96), requiring hospitalization (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.14-1.59, P < 0.001; 4 studies, n = 6611), being admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU; OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.15-1.65, P = 0.001; 9 studies, n = 5298), and undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV; OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.29-2.40, P < 0.001; 7 studies, n = 1558) compared to non-obese patients. However, obese patients had similar likelihoods of death from COVID-19 as non-obese patients (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.74-1.25, P = 0.750; 9 studies, n = 20,597). Collectively, these data from the first 6 months of the pandemic suggested that obesity is associated with a more severe COVID-19 disease course but may not be associated with increased mortality.","Zhang, Xinya; Lewis, Alexander M; Moley, John R; Brestoff, Jonathan R",Sci Rep,,476
446967,Mediating Role of Resilience on Nursing Faculty and Student QoL during COVID-19,2021,"The first wave of SARS-CoV-2 has deeply affected long term care facilities in the province of Quebec. In response, governmental officials took protective measures, such as suspending visits and activities and even requiring residents to self-isolate to their room. Consequently, residents with major cognitive impairments were cut from their routine as well as from significant social interactions, support, and stimulation essential to their well-being. This isolation negatively affected many residents. For some of them, the loss of bearings resulted in newly or deteriorated behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). These residents were then more at risk of contracting the virus or contaminating others. To face this challenge, hotels in the Greater Montreal area were transformed into temporary care facilities. As members of a multidisciplinary team specialized in the management of BPSD, we were asked to support the redeployed staff who had little experience in this domain. In this paper, we present the innovative tools implemented in this uncommon work setting. We also discuss factors identified as facilitating the care and treatment of people with BPSD. This experience leads us to propose avenues toward better BPSD management.","Debas, K.; Beauchamp, J.; Ouellet, C.",Frontiers in psychiatry Frontiers Research Foundation,,476

Among the survey respondents (n = 619), 59.9% were female, 61.1% were from 18 to 30 years of age, and 42.3% held an undergraduate's degree. The mean scores for each scale were as follows: perceived knowledge (36.3 ± 6.1), attitude (29.4 ± 4.7), practice (44.1 ± 4.8), total score (109.7 ± 13.2), barrier (0.2 ± 0.7), and cognition and behavior change score (8.5 ± 1.4). Perceived knowledge, attitude, practice, total score, and cognition and behavior changes were significantly and positively correlated, whereas barrier was negatively correlated with those scales (P < 0.001). Linear regressions revealed that those respondents who were medical professionals, civil servants, employees of state-owned enterprises and public institutions, and had relatively higher level of education were associated with a higher perceived knowledge score, attitude score, practice score, and total score. Higher mean cognition and behavior change scores was associated with company employees (8.8 ± 1.3). More than half of the respondents (51.4%) were optimistic about the government's interventional measures. The respondents in China had good knowledge, positive attitude, and active practice toward COVID-19, yet, it is advisable to strengthen nationwide publicity and focus on the target undereducated population by means of We-Chat, microblog, website, and community workers for better control effect.","Fang, Yaqing; Liu, Panpan; Gao, Qisheng",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,,476

The spectrum of COVID-19 is broad, from clinical disease requiring intensive medical care to less severe symptoms that are treated with supportive care. The majority of COVID-19 cases fall into the mild-to-moderate category, with symptoms lasting less than 6 weeks. Nevertheless, the morbidity from COVID-19 is significant and can affect multiple body systems, most frequently the cardiac, pulmonary, hematologic, musculoskeletal, and gastrointestinal systems. For patients who wish to return to exercise after mild-to-moderate COVID-19, the wide range of disease expression presents a challenge for clinicians seeking to offer counsel. This literature review on return to activity following mild to moderate COVID-19 in the recreational athlete includes evidence-based considerations and recommendations for clinicians in guiding the safest return to activity.","Metzl, Jordan D; McElheny, Kathryn; Robinson, James N; Scott, Daphne A; Sutton, Karen M; Toresdahl, Brett G",HSS J,,476

The socio-economic context of the eight South Asian countries is averse to any long-term lockdown program, but the region still observed stringent lockdown close to two months. This paper analyzed major measures in public health preparedness and responses in South Asian countries in the fight against pandemic. The research was based on a situation analysis to discuss appropriate plan for epidemic preparedness, strategies for prevention and control measures, and adequate response management mechanism. Based on the data from March 21 to June 26, 2020, it appeared that lockdown program along with other control measures were not as effective to arrest the exponential growth of fortnightly new COVID-19 cases in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan. However, Bhutan, the Maldives and Sri Lanka have been successfully managing to limit the spread of the disease. The in-depth analysis of prevention and control measures espoused that densely populated context of South Asia needs community-led intervention strategy, such as case containment strategy, in order to reverse the growing trend, and adopt the policy of mitigation instead of suppression to formulate COVID-19 action plan. On the other hand, mechanism for response management encompassed a four-tier approach of governance to weave community-led local bodies with state, national and international governance actors for enhancing the countries' emergency operation system. It is concluded that resource-crunch countries in South Asia are unable to cope with the disproportionate demand of capital as well as skilled health care workforce at the time of the pandemic. Hence, response management needs an approach of governance maximization instead of resource maximization. The epidemiologic management of population coupled with suitable public health prevention and control measures may be a more appropriate strategy to strike a balance between economy and population health during the time of pandemic.","Sarkar, Amitabha; Liu, Guang-Qi; Jin, Yinzi; Xie, Zheng; Zheng, Zhi-Jie",,,476

Furthermore, we examine restrictions on visiting nursing homes given the high death toll in that setting. In our analysis, we zero in on the principles of foreseeability and proportionality, highlighting areas of concern and aspects that we submit should be considered in a proportionality assessment. Ultimately, we argue that it is a mistake to view the COVID-19 pandemic solely as an emergency. In this manner, the solutions suggested through the law - restrictions on movement and visitation bans - are too narrow and fail to address the underlying structures, such as, issues in the healthcare system, the limited home help for elderly and poor conditions in nursing homes.","Ó Cathaoir, Katharina; Gundersby Rognlien, Ida",Eur J Health Law,,476

METHODS: We performed an international retrospective study of COVID-19 patients on ECMO from 13 intensive care units from March 1 to April 30, 2020. Demographic data, ECMO characteristics and clinical outcomes were collected. The primary outcome was to assess the complication rate and 28-day mortality; the secondary outcome was to compare patient and ECMO characteristics between COVID-19 patients on ECMO and non-COVID-19 related ARDS patients on ECMO (non-COVID-19; January 1, 2018 until July 31, 2019). RESULTS: During the study period 71 COVID-19 patients received ECMO, mostly veno-venous, for a median duration of 13 days (IQR 7-20). ECMO was initiated at 5 days (IQR 3-10) following invasive mechanical ventilation. Median PaO2/FiO2 ratio prior to initiation of ECMO was similar in COVID-19 patients (58 mmHg [IQR 46-76]) and non-COVID-19 patients (53 mmHg [IQR 44-66]), the latter consisting of 48 patients. 28-day mortality was 37% in COVID-19 patients and 27% in non-COVID-19 patients. However, Kaplan-Meier curves showed that after a 100-day follow-up this non-significant difference resolves. Non-surviving COVID-19 patients were more acidotic prior to initiation ECMO, had a shorter ECMO run and fewer received muscle paralysis compared to survivors. CONCLUSIONS: No significant differences in outcomes were found between COVID-19 patients on ECMO and non-COVID-19 ARDS patients on ECMO. This suggests that ECMO could be considered as a supportive therapy in case of refractory respiratory failure in COVID-19.","Raasveld, Senta Jorinde; Delnoij, Thijs S R; Broman, Lars M; Lansink-Hartgring, Annemieke Oude; Hermans, Greet; De Troy, Erwin; Taccone, Fabio S; Quintana Diaz, Manuel; van der Velde, Franciska; Miranda, Dinis Dos Reis; Scholten, Erik; Vlaar, Alexander P J",J Intensive Care Med,,476

The detection limit for this assay was 1 copy/µL SARS-CoV-2. To test the clinical sensitivity and specificity of the assay, 37 positive and 20 negative samples were used. The WarmStart colorimetric RT-LAMP had 100% sensitivity and specificity. End products were detected by direct observation, thereby eliminating the need for post-amplification processing steps.

Among other important proteins, the role of accessory proteins are of immense importance in replication, regulation of infections of the coronavirus in the hosts. The largest accessory protein in the SARS-CoV2 genome is ORF3a which modulates the host response to the virus infection and consequently it plays an important role in pathogenesis. In this study, an attempt is made to decipher the conservation of nucleotides, dimers, codons and amino acids in the ORF3a genes across thirty-two genomes of Indian patients. ORF3a gene possesses single and double point mutations in Indian SARS-CoV2 genomes suggesting the change of SARS-CoV2's virulence property in Indian patients. We find that the parental origin of the ORF3a gene over the genomes of SARS-CoV2 and Pangolin-CoV is same from the phylogenetic analysis based on conservation of nucleotides and so on. This study highlights the accumulation of mutation on ORF3a in Indian SARS-CoV2 genomes which may provide the designing therapeutic approach against SARS-CoV2.","Hassan, Sk Sarif; Choudhury, Pabitra Pal; Basu, Pallab; Jana, Siddhartha Sankar",Genomics,,476

While these measures helped prevent the community spread of the virus, the resulting environmental benefits of lockdown remained mostly unnoticed. While many studies documented improvements in air quality index, very few have explored the reduction in black carbon (BC) aerosols and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) concentrations due to lockdown. In this study, we evaluated the changes in concentrations of BC, PAHs, and PM2.5 before and during the lockdown period. Our results show that lockdown resulted in a significant reduction in concentrations of these pollutants. The average mass concentration of BC, PAHs, and PM2.5 before the lockdown was 11.71 ± 3.33 µgm-3, 108.71 ± 27.77 ngm-3, and 147.65 ± 41.77 µgm-3, respectively. During the lockdown period, the concentration of BC, PAHs, and PM2.5 was 2.46 ± 0.95 µgm-3, 23.19 ± 11.21 ngm-3, and 50.31 ± 11.95 µgm-3, respectively. The diagnostic ratio analysis for source apportionment showed changes in the emission sources before and during the lockdown. The primary sources of PAHs emissions before the lockdown were biomass, coal combustion, and vehicular traffic, while during the lockdown, PAHs emissions were primarily from the combustion of biomass and coal. Similarly, before the lockdown, the BC mass concentrations came from fossil-fuel and wood-burning, while during the lockdown period, most of the BC mass concentration came from wood-burning. Human health risk assessment demonstrated a significant reduction in risk due to inhalation of PAHs and BC-contaminated air.","Ambade, Balram; Kurwadkar, Sudarshan; Sankar, Tapan Kumar; Kumar, Amit",Air Qual Atmos Health,,476

Despite the great efforts that have been made in this field since the appearance of COVID-19 (2019), the field still suffers from two drawbacks. First, the number of available X-ray scans labeled as COVID-19-infected is relatively small. Second, all the works that have been carried out in the field are separate; there are no unified data, classes, and evaluation protocols. In this work, based on public and newly collected data, we propose two X-ray COVID-19 databases, which are three-class COVID-19 and five-class COVID-19 datasets. For both databases, we evaluate different deep learning architectures. Moreover, we propose an Ensemble-CNNs approach which outperforms the deep learning architectures and shows promising results in both databases. In other words, our proposed Ensemble-CNNs achieved a high performance in the recognition of COVID-19 infection, resulting in accuracies of 100% and 98.1% in the three-class and five-class scenarios, respectively. In addition, our approach achieved promising results in the overall recognition accuracy of 75.23% and 81.0% for the three-class and five-class scenarios, respectively.

The focus of this communication is on a potential biomarker, short telomere length (TL), that might serve to identify patients more likely to die from the SARS-CoV-2 infection, regardless of age. The common thread linking these patients is lymphopenia, which largely reflects a decline in the numbers of CD4/CD8 T cells but not B cells. These findings are consistent with data that lymphocyte TL dynamics impose a limit on T-cell proliferation.

SARS-Cov-2 infection can overlap with pre-existing chronic liver disease or induce liver damage directly or indirectly. From the data of the literature and from what is inferred from the case report it clearly emerges that alcohol related liver disease (ALD) patients are particularly vulnerable to SARS-Cov-2 infection. Thereafter, some considerations can be deduced from the analysis of the case report: in subjects with pre-existing cirrhosis hepatologists should play more attention to hepatic injury and monitor risk of hepatic failure caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19); it is appropriate to promptly define the alcoholic etiology and investigate whether the patient is actively consuming. In fact, withdrawal symptoms may be present and the prognosis of these patients is also worse. Physicians should be alerted to the possibility of the development of ACLF in this population; hepatotoxic drugs should be avoided; it is recommended to use of hepatoprotective therapy to mitigate the negative impact of Covid-19; it is mandatory to administer anti Covid-19 vaccine to patients with alcohol related liver cirrhosis.","Testino, Gianni; Pellicano, Rinaldo",,,476
451484,Beyond COVID-19 lockdown: A Coasean approach with optionality,2020,"This study examines the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the stock liquidity of S&P 500 firms. We construct a daily data set for stock liquidity and the numbers of COVID-19 reported cases and deaths for the period from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2020. The regression results show that there is a significant negative relationship between COVID-19 (as measured by the daily growth in the numbers of cases and deaths) and stock liquidity, implying that the COVID-19 pandemic decreases firm liquidity. Furthermore, our analysis reveals a significant difference in liquidity between sectors. In addition, our results remain robust to the use of an alternative proxy for liquidity and to alternative estimation approaches. The results of this study will allow key players in the stock market to recognize and forecast the behavior of stock liquidity during periods marked by pandemic diseases.","Chebbi, Kaouthar Ammer Mohammed Abdullah Hameed Affan",The Quarterly Review of Economics and Finance,,476

To study associations of severity of COVID-19 disease with clinical features and laboratory markers. 2. To develop a model to predict the need for ICU treatment. Methods: This is an analysis of clinical course in 800 consecutive patients from a dedicated COVID-19 tertiary care hospital in Pune, India (8th April to 15th June 2020). We obtained clinical and laboratory information, severity grading and progress from hospital records. We studied associations of these characteristics with need for ICU management. We developed a predictive model of need for ICU treatment among first 500 patients and tested its sensitivity and specificity in the following 300 patients. Results: Average age was 41 years, 16% were <20 years of age, 55% were male, 50% were asymptomatic and 16% had at least one comorbidity. Using MoHFW India severity guidelines, 73% patients had mild, 6% moderate and 20% severe disease. Severity was associated with higher age, symptomatic presentation, elevated neutrophil and reduced lymphocyte counts and elevated inflammatory markers. Seventy-seven patients needed ICU treatment: they were older (56 years), more symptomatic and had lower SpO2 and abnormal chest X-ray and deranged hematology and biochemistry at admission. A model trained on the first 500 patients, using above variables predicted need for ICU treatment with sensitivity 80%, specificity 88% in subsequent 300 patients;exclusion of expensive laboratory tests (Ferritin, C- Reactive Protein) did not affect accuracy. Conclusion: In the early phase of COVID- 19 pendemic, a significant proportion of hospitalized patients were young and asymptomatic. Need for ICU treatment was predicted by simple measures including higher age, symptomatic onset, low SpO2 and abnormal chest X-ray. We propose a simple model for referring patients for treatment at specialized COVID-19 hospitals. © 2021 Journal of Association of Physicians of India. All rights reserved.","Shukla, U.

451775,ITU-WHO-UNICEF initiative delivers vital information on COVID-19,2020,"Given the accumulated evidence on the effects of water-in-deep eutectic solvents (DESs) on the solvent nanostructure and the yield of lipase reactions, here we have used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to delineate the structure and dynamics of thermoalkalophilic lipases in choline chloride/urea-based DES (reline) with varying hydration levels. Results indicated that pure reline almost froze the lipase backbone, while hydrated reline that showed a less ordered nanostructure than the pure form introduced some fluctuations to lipase structures, particularly to the lid domain. Although none of the solvents led to unfolding, solvation by 8 M urea or water when accompanied with elevated temperature caused the most significant loss of secondary structure. Experimental results indicated that lipase incubation in slightly hydrated reline [5% (v/v)] led to the highest level of residual activity, implying interfacial activation. Overall, we report that slightly hydrated reline activates thermoalkalophilic lipases, consistent with the particular MD observation showing enhanced mobility of the lid domain. These insights provided by this study contribute to designing efficient lipase applications in DES-based reaction media, giving cues for customizing water-in-DESs for optimal enzyme stability and activity.","Shehata, Mohamed; Unlu, Aise; Sezerman, Ugur; Timucin, Emel",J Phys Chem B,,476

The clinical and histopathological features and relationship to COVID-19 have not been well described. The objective of this case series is to describe the clinical features and determine the histopathologic findings and clinical implications of the clusters of acral perniosis cases identified in pediatric patients. METHODS: We describe six otherwise healthy adolescents-three siblings per family from two unrelated families-presented within a 48-hour period in April, 2020, with acral perniosis-like lesions in the context of over 30 similar patients who were evaluated within the same week. RESULTS: Affected patients had mild symptoms of viral upper respiratory infection (URI) or contact with symptomatic persons 1-2 weeks preceding the rash. They all presented with red to violaceous macules and dusky, purpuric plaques scattered on the mid and distal aspects of the toes. Skin biopsies performed on each of the six patients demonstrated near identical histopathologic findings to those of idiopathic perniosis, with a lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrate without evidence of thromboembolism or immune complex vasculitis. While SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction was negative, testing was performed 1-2 weeks after URI symptoms or sick contact exposure. CONCLUSION: We offer a clinical approach to evaluation of patients with this presentation and discuss the possibility that these skin findings represent a convalescent-phase cutaneous reaction to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Cordoro, Kelly M; Reynolds, Sean D; Wattier, Rachel; McCalmont, Timothy H",Pediatr Dermatol,,476

The atomic pair distributions show the first peak at 1.90â Å due to the Te-O equatorial bonds and the Te-O peak is asymmetrical due to the range of Te-O bond lengths in glass, anti-glass and crystalline samples. The short-range structural properties of glasses such as Te-O bond lengths, Te-O speciation, Te-Te distances and O-Te-O bond angle distributions were determined by RMC simulations. The average Te-O coordination number (NTe-O) for 5SrO-95TeO2 glass is 3.93 which decreases to 3.59 on increasing the SrO concentration to 10â mol.%. The changes in NTe-O revealed that the glass network predominantly contains TeO4 units with a small amount of TeO3 units and there is a structural transformation TeO4 â TeO3 with an increase in SrO concentration. The O-Te-O bond angle distributions have a peak at 79° and reveal that the Oequatorial-Te-Oequatorial bonds are the most abundant linkages in the tellurite network. Two glass samples containing 7.5 and 8.5â mol.% of SrO were annealed at 350°C for 1â h to produce anti-glass phases; they were further annealed at 450°C for 4â h to transform them into crystalline phases. The anti-glass samples are disordered cubic SrTe5O11 and the disordered monoclinic SrTeO3 phases, whereas the crystalline samples contain monoclinic SrTeO3 and the orthorhombic TeO2 phases. The unit-cell parameters of the anti-glass and crystalline structures were determined by Fullprof Rietveld refinement. Thermal studies found that the glass transition temperature increases with an increase in SrO mol.% and the results on the short-range structure of glasses from Raman spectroscopy are in agreement with the RMC findings.","Kaur, Rajinder; Khanna, Atul; Dippel, Ann Christin; Gutowski, Olof; González, Fernando; González-Barriuso, Marina",Acta Crystallogr B Struct Sci Cryst Eng Mater,,476

AIMS: The aim of this service evaluation was to assess the utilization and effectiveness of the pathway in supporting referrers during a pandemic. METHODS: Referrals between March-August 2020 were analysed by date and industry to assess service utilization. A survey was sent to a convenience sample of referrers throughout this period, requesting feedback on whether the report led to a change in how the worker was managed, and whether it increased referrer confidence in managing the worker. RESULTS: Five hundred and seventy referrals were made, predominantly from wholesale and retail; professional, scientific and technical; and food and drink production. There was a small peak of referrals from manufacturing in April and a larger peak in July-August from wholesale and retail, and food and drink production. Of 166 surveys sent, 58 were completed (35% response rate). In 71% of cases, referrers indicated that the report led to change in how the worker was managed, and in 86% of cases, referrers reported being more confident in managing the worker. CONCLUSIONS: The pathway was well-utilized.

METHODS: Any individual who tested positive for COVID-19 was classified as a confirmed case. Measures were taken to identify the source of infection and trace and quarantine contacts. Serial intervals were estimated and the effective reproduction number was computed. RESULTS: Of the total 18,303 COVID-19 tests performed between January 16, 2020 and March 24, 2020 in Busan, 108 yielded positive results (positive test rate, 0.6%). All confirmed cases were placed in isolation at hospitals. Of the 108 confirmed cases, 59 (54.6%) were female. The most common age group was 20-29 years with 37 cases (34.3%). Regarding symptoms at the time of diagnosis, cough (n=38, 35.2%) and fever (n=34, 31.5%) were most common; 12 cases (11.1%) were asymptomatic. The source of infection was identified in 99 cases (91.7%). A total of 3,223 contacts were identified and quarantined. Household contacts accounted for 196, and the household secondary attack rate was 8.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.7 to 12.9). The mean serial interval was estimated to be 5.54 days (95% CI, 4.08 to 7.01). After February 26, (Rt) remained below 1 in Busan. CONCLUSIONS: The early containment strategy implemented in Busan shows that control is possible if outbreaks are of limited scope. In preparation for future outbreaks, public health and healthcare systems should be re-examined and put in a ready state.","Son, Hyunjin; Lee, Hyojung; Lee, Miyoung; Eun, Youngduck; Park, Kyounghee; Kim, Seungjin; Park, Wonseo; Kwon, Sora; Ahn, Byoungseon; Kim, Dongkeun; Kim, Changhoon",Epidemiol Health,,476

455503,Covid-19: Exponential growth in infections in England is driven by young people,2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has currently led to a global pandemic with millions of confirmed and increasing cases around the world. The novel SARS-CoV-2 not only affects the lungs causing severe acute respiratory dysfunction but also leads to significant dysfunction in multiple organs and physiological systems including the cardiovascular system. A plethora of studies have shown the viral infection triggers an exaggerated immune response, hypercoagulation and oxidative stress, which contribute significantly to poor cardiovascular outcomes observed in COVID-19 patients. To date, there are no approved vaccines or therapies for COVID-19. Accordingly, cardiovascular protective and supportive therapies are urgent and necessary to the overall prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Accumulating literature has demonstrated the beneficial effects of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) toward the cardiovascular system, which include ameliorating uncontrolled inflammatory reactions, reduced oxidative stress and mitigating coagulopathy. Moreover, it has been demonstrated the n-3 PUFAs, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are precursors to a group of potent bioactive lipid mediators, generated endogenously, which mediate many of the beneficial effects attributed to their parent compounds. Considering the favorable safety profile for n-3 PUFAs and their metabolites, it is reasonable to consider n-3 PUFAs as potential adjuvant therapies for the clinical management of COVID-19 patients. In this article, we provide an overview of the pathogenesis of cardiovascular complications secondary to COVID-19 and focus on the mechanisms that may contribute to the likely benefits of n-3 PUFAs and their metabolites.","Darwesh, Ahmed M; Bassiouni, Wesam; Sosnowski, Deanna K; Seubert, John M",Pharmacol Ther,,476

We aimed to investigate the changes in the number of patients who requested a dermatology outpatient clinic visit due to the increased social and medical burden caused by COVID-19 in Turkey during the first days of the pandemic. We also examined the most common dermatologic diseases diagnosed during the COVID-19 outbreak. A statistically significant negative correlation was found between the number of COVID-19 patients in the country and the number of patients requesting a dermatology outpatient clinic visit in the secondary and tertiary care hospitals during self-quarantine. In the first 10 days after the COVID-19 outbreak, acne (28.2%), urticaria (12.8%), scabies (12.8%), irritant contact dermatitis (10.3%), and xerosis cutis (10.2%) were the most common diseases seen in the dermatology clinic at the secondary care hospital, while acne (23.3%), warts (5.4%), seborrheic dermatitis (4.5%), urticaria (3.8%), and psoriasis (3.32%) were the most common diseases seen in the dermatology clinic at the tertiary care hospital. This is our first study on the frequency and nature of outpatient dermatology visits during this novel coronavirus pandemic. Understanding the trends and impacts of dermatologic diseases on patients and health systems during this pandemic will allow for better preparation of dermatologists in the future.","Kutlu, Ömer; Günes, Ridvan; Coerdt, Kathleen; Metin, Ahmet; Khachemoune, Amor",Dermatol Ther,,476

However, trading signals are usually obtained via simple observation of past return measurements. In this article we study the benefits of incorporating dynamic econometric models to sequentially learn the time-varying importance of different look-back periods for individual assets. By the use of a dynamic binary classifier model, the investor is able to switch between time-varying or constant relations between past momentum and future returns, dynamically combining or selecting different momentum speeds during turning points, improving trading signals accuracy and portfolio performance. Using data from 56 future contracts we show that a mean-variance investor will be willing to pay a considerable management fee to switch from the traditional naive time series momentum strategy to the dynamic classifier approach.","Levy, Bruno P.

We intended to analyze whether these perceptions may differ between patients from waves 1 and 2 of the pandemic. METHODS: Cross-sectional study at two time periods (May to June, sample 1) and September to November 2020 (sample 2) with standardized questionnaires (i.e. WHO-5, MLQ, PCQ-12). RESULTS: Patients from sample 1 (n = 292) and sample 2 (n = 221) did not differ with respect to gender, age, partner or tumor status. Most are still ""irritated by statements about danger and course of the infection"" (58%) and are ""worrying to be infected and to have complicated course of disease"" (55%). Neither their well-being nor meaning in life nor fears and worries were significantly different. In sample 2 patients, Worrying reflections and loneliness scored significantly lower, while their Perception of nature and silence was lower in trend only; more intense relationships are still relevant. Moments of wondering awe and religious trust were perceived less often during wave 2. Particularly religious patients scored stronger for Perception of nature and silence and Worrying reflections and loneliness. CONCLUSION: Oncologists/psychologist have to know that patients' situation has not changed within the time of pandemic and that they still require information, close support and encouragement to rely on their resources to cope. Perceived changes are reflecting coping strategies that could be trained to increase patients' resilience during further pandemic waves.","Büssing, Arndt; Recchia, Daniela Rodrigues; Hübner, Jutta; Walter, Stefanie; Büntzel, Judith; Büntzel, Jens",J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,,476
457565,"Effects of COVID-19 outbreak on the sound environment of the city of Milan, Italy",2021,"New studies of COVID-19 are constantly updating best practices in clinical care. Often, it is impractical to apply recommendations based on high-income country investigations to resource limited settings in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We present a set of pragmatic recommendations for the management of anticoagulation and thrombotic disease for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in LMICs. In the absence of contraindications, we recommend prophylactic anticoagulation with either low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UFH) for all hospitalized COVID-19 patients in LMICs. If available, we recommend LMWH over UFH for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis to minimize risk to healthcare workers. We recommend against the use of aspirin for VTE prophylaxis in hospitalized COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients in LMICs. Because of limited evidence, we suggest against the use of ""enhanced"" or ""intermediate"" prophylaxis in COVID-19 patients in LMICs. Based on current available evidence, we recommend against the initiation of empiric therapeutic anticoagulation without clinical suspicion for VTE. If contraindications exist to chemical prophylaxis, we recommend mechanical prophylaxis with intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) devices or graduated compression stockings (GCS) for hospitalized COVID-19 patients in LMICs. In LMICs, we recommend initiating therapeutic anticoagulation for hospitalized COVID-19 patients, in accordance with local clinical practice guidelines, if there is high clinical suspicion for VTE, even in the absence of testing. If available, we recommend LMWH over UFH or Direct oral anticoagulants for treatment of VTE in LMICs to minimize risk to healthcare workers. In LMIC settings where continuous intravenous UFH or LMWH are unavailable or not feasible to use, we recommend fixed dose heparin, adjusted to body weight, in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with high clinical suspicion of VTE. We suggest D-dimer measurement, if available and affordable, at the time of admission for risk stratification, or when clinical suspicion for VTE is high. For hospitalized COVID-19 patients in LMICs, based on current available evidence, we make no recommendation on the use of serial D-dimer monitoring for the initiation of therapeutic anticoagulation. For hospitalized COVID-19 patients in LMICs receiving intravenous therapeutic UFH, we recommend serial monitoring of partial thromboplastin time or anti-factor Xa level, based on local laboratory capabilities. For hospitalized COVID-19 patients in LMICs receiving LMWH, we suggest against serial monitoring of anti-factor Xa level. We suggest serial monitoring of platelet counts in patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation for VTE, to assess risk of bleeding or development of heparin induced thrombocytopenia.","Ahmed, Hanan Y; Papali, Alfred; Haile, Tewodros; Shrestha, Gentle S; Schultz, Marcus J; Lundeg, Ganbold; Akrami, Kevan M",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,,476
457645,Rituximab und COVID-19: Kommt es auf das Timing an?,2021,"Over recent years, mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) and their potential biomedical applications have received much attention from the global scientific community in an increasing manner. Firstly, MSCs were successfully isolated from human bone marrow (BM), but in the next steps, they were also extracted from other sources, mostly from the umbilical cord (UC) and adipose tissue (AT). The International Society for Cellular Therapy (ISCT) has suggested minimum criteria to identify and characterize MSCs as follows: plastic adherence, surface expression of CD73, D90, CD105 in the lack of expression of CD14, CD34, CD45, and human leucocyte antigen-DR (HLA-DR), and also the capability to differentiate to multiple cell types including adipocyte, chondrocyte, or osteoblast in vitro depends on culture conditions. However, these distinct properties, including self-renewability, multipotency, and easy accessibility are just one side of the coin; another side is their huge secretome which is comprised of hundreds of mediators, cytokines, and signaling molecules and can effectively modulate the inflammatory responses and control the infiltration process that finally leads to a regulated tissue repair/healing or regeneration process. MSC-mediated immunomodulation is a direct result of a harmonic synergy of MSC-released signaling molecules (i.e., mediators, cytokines, and chemokines), the reaction of immune cells and other target cells to those molecules, and also feedback in the MSC-molecule-target cell axis. These features make MSCs a respectable and eligible therapeutic candidate to be evaluated in immune-mediated disorders, such as graft versus host diseases (GVHD), multiple sclerosis (MS), Crohn's disease (CD), and osteoarthritis (OA), and even in immune-dysregulating infectious diseases such as the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This paper discussed the therapeutic applications of MSC secretome and its biomedical aspects related to immune-mediated conditions. Sources for MSC extraction, their migration and homing properties, therapeutic molecules released by MSCs, and the pathways and molecular mechanisms possibly involved in the exceptional immunoregulatory competence of MSCs were discussed. Besides, the novel discoveries and recent findings on immunomodulatory plasticity of MSCs, clinical applications, and the methods required for their use as an effective therapeutic option in patients with immune-mediated/immune-dysregulating diseases were highlighted.","Markov, Alexander; Thangavelu, Lakshmi; Aravindhan, Surendar; Zekiy, Angelina Olegovna; Jarahian, Mostafa; Chartrand, Max Stanley; Pathak, Yashwant; Marofi, Faroogh; Shamlou, Somayeh; Hassanzadeh, Ali",Stem Cell Res Ther,,476

Also, they can help to manage scarce healthcare resources to control the massive burden of COVID-19 patients in hospitals. However, a large portion of today's telehealth and telemedicine systems are centralized and fall short of providing necessary information security and privacy, operational transparency, health records immutability, and traceability to detect frauds related to patients' insurance claims and physician credentials. METHODS: The current study has explored the potential opportunities and adaptability challenges for blockchain technology in telehealth and telemedicine sector. It has explored the key role that blockchain technology can play to provide necessary information security and privacy, operational transparency, health records immutability, and traceability to detect frauds related to patients' insurance claims and physician credentials. RESULTS: Blockchain technology can improve telehealth and telemedicine services by offering remote healthcare services in a manner that is decentralized, tamper-proof, transparent, traceable, reliable, trustful, and secure. It enables health professionals to accurately identify frauds related to physician educational credentials and medical testing kits commonly used for home-based diagnosis.

Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and chest computed tomography (CT) imaging both play an important role in COVID-19 diagnosis. Chest CT imaging offers the benefits of quick reporting, a low cost, and high sensitivity for the detection of pulmonary infection. Recently, deep-learning-based computer vision methods have demonstrated great promise for use in medical imaging applications, including X-rays, magnetic resonance imaging, and CT imaging. However, training a deep-learning model requires large volumes of data, and medical staff faces a high risk when collecting COVID-19 CT data due to the high infectivity of the disease. Another issue is the lack of experts available for data labeling. In order to meet the data requirements for COVID-19 CT imaging, we propose a CT image synthesis approach based on a conditional generative adversarial network that can effectively generate high-quality and realistic COVID-19 CT images for use in deep-learning-based medical imaging tasks. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art image synthesis methods with the generated COVID-19 CT images and indicates promising for various machine learning applications including semantic segmentation and classification.","Jiang, Yifan; Chen, Han; Loew, M H; Ko, Hanseok",IEEE j. biomed. health inform.

In this study, we assessed a panel of 15 3D molecular similarity programs against the DUD-E and LIT-PCBA datasets, including commercial ROCS and Phase, in terms of screening power and scaffold-hopping power. The results revealed that (1) SHAFTS, LS-align, Phase Shape_Pharm and LIGSIFT showed the best VS capability in terms of screening power. Some 3D similarity tools available to academia can yield relatively better VS performance than commercial ROCS and Phase software. (2) Current 3D similarity VS tools exhibit a considerable ability to capture actives with new chemotypes in terms of scaffold hopping. (3) Multiple conformers relative to single conformations will generally improve VS performance for most 3D similarity tools, with marginal improvement observed in area under the receiving operator characteristic curve values, enrichment factor in the top 1% and hit rate in the top 1% values showed larger improvement. Moreover, redundancy and complementarity analyses of hit lists from different query seeds and different 3D similarity VS tools showed that the combination of different query seeds and/or different 3D similarity tools in VS campaigns retrieved more (and more diverse) active molecules. These findings provide useful information for guiding choices of the optimal 3D molecular similarity tools for VS practices and designing possible combination strategies to discover more diverse active compounds.","Jiang, Zhenla; Xu, Jianrong; Yan, Aixia; Wang, Ling",Brief. bioinform,,476

At the time of writing, no preventive vaccine has been developed and tested in the community. This study was conducted to review studies aimed at preventing the spread of the coronavirus worldwide. METHODS: This study was a review of the evidence-based literature and was conducted by searching databases, including Google Scholar, PubMed, and ScienceDirect, until April 2020. The search was performed based on keywords including ""coronavirus"", ""COVID-19"", and ""prevention"". The list of references in the final studies has also been re-reviewed to find articles that might not have been obtained through the search. The guidelines published by trustworthy organizations such as the World Health Organization and Center for Disease Control have been used in this study. CONCLUSION: So far, no vaccine or definitive treatment for COVID-19 has been invented, and the disease has become a pandemic. Therefore, observation of hand hygiene, disinfection of high-touch surfaces, observation of social distance, and lack of presence in public places are recommended as preventive measures. Moreover, to control the situation and to reduce the incidence of the virus, some of the measures taken by the decision-making bodies and the guidelines of the deterrent institutions to strengthen telecommuting of employees and reduce the presence of people in the community and prevent unnecessary activities, are very important.","Arefi, Maryam Feiz; Poursadeqiyan, Mohsen",Work,,476

COVID-19 has tested the status quo of China's health informatization, revealing challenges to the health care system. This viewpoint evaluates the development, status quo, and practice of China's health informatization, especially during COVID-19, and makes recommendations to address the health informatization challenges. We collected, assessed, and evaluated data on the development of China's health informatization from five perspectives-health information infrastructure, information technology (IT) applications, financial and intellectual investment, health resource allocation, and standard system-and discussed the status quo of the internet plus health care service pattern during COVID-19. The main data sources included China's policy documents and national plans on health informatization, commercial and public welfare sources and websites, public reports, institutional reports, and academic papers. In particular, we extracted data from the 2019 National Health Informatization Survey released by the National Health Commission in China. We found that China developed its health information infrastructure and IT applications, made significant financial and intellectual informatization investments, and improved health resource allocations. Tested during COVID-19, China's current health informatization system, especially the internet plus health care system, has played a crucial role in monitoring and controlling the pandemic and allocating medical resources. However, an uneven distribution of health resources and insufficient financial and intellectual investment continue to challenge China's health informatization. China's rapid development of health informatization played a crucial role during COVID-19, providing a reference point for global pandemic prevention and control. To further promote health informatization, China's health informatization needs to strengthen top-level design, increase investment and training, upgrade the health infrastructure and IT applications, and improve internet plus health care services.","Huang, Mian; Wang, Jian; Nicholas, Stephen; Maitland, Elizabeth; Guo, Ziyue",J Med Internet Res,,476

462587,Decoding Clinical Biomarker Space of COVID-19: Exploring Matrix Factorization-based Feature Selection Methods,2021,"Background: Rupture of sinus of Valsalva (RSV) to right atrium (RA) causes significant left to right shunt, tricuspid regurgitation, and right ventricular failure. If left uncorrected it can lead to biventricular heart failure. Hence, early invasive management is advised. To date, there is no report about platypnoea-orthodeoxia syndrome (POS) after device closure of ruptured sinus of Valsalva. Case summary: A 50-year-old woman with dyspnoea of exertion and rupture of sinus valsalva to right atrium was referred to our hospital. On admission, chest computed tomography (CT) was normal. After closure of the rupture, she developed orthostatic hypoxemia and frequent cough. A repeat chest CT was suggestive of COVID-19 infection which most probably occurred during the hospitalization. Although COVID-19 was thought to be the only culprit, her symptoms were not solely justified by COVID-19. Transthoracic echocardiography showed patent foramen ovale (PFO) with significant shunt. PFO device closure was performed under intracardiac echocardiography guidance. Discussion: Interatrial septum deformation may happen after RSV correction and right to left shunt from PFO may become more significant. POS is an important indication for PFO closure which should be noticed by careful examination. As COVID-19 is the most frequent pathology these days, it may delay other probable diagnosis, and hence detailed history taking and physical examination is mandatory.","Jenab, Y.; Hosseinsabet, A.; Vaskelyte, L.; Hosseini, K.",European Heart Journal.

464774,Anesthesia in the times of COVID-19,2020,"The outbreak of COVID-19 has posed significant challenges to governments across the world. The increase in hazardous infectious waste (HIW) caused by the pandemic is associated with the risk of transmitting the virus. In this study, hazardous waste includes infectious waste generated both by individuals and by hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic. To control the outbreak by maintaining social distance and home quarantine protocols, daily necessities and health supplies must be provided to the people affected. Governments play an essential role in the management of the crisis, creating an elaborate plan for collecting HIW and providing necessities and health supplies. This paper proposes a leader-follower approach for hazardous infectious waste collection and government aid distribution to control COVID-19. At the top level of the model, government policies are designed to support people by distributing daily necessities and health supplies, and to support contractors by waste collection. The lower level of the model is related to the operational decisions of contractors with limited capacities. Due to the potential risk of virus transmission via contaminated waste, the proposed model considers the complications imposed on contractors at the lower level. Applying a stochastic programming approach, four possible scenarios are examined, dependent of the severity of the outbreak. As a solution approach, the Benders decomposition method is combined with Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. The results show that government support, in addition to much better management of citizen demand, can control the spread of the virus by implementing quarantine decisions.","Valizadeh, Jaber; Hafezalkotob, Ashkan; Alizadeh, Seyed Mehdi; Mozafari, Payman",Sustain Cities Soc,,476

As one moves forward with different methods to reduce the infection and mortality rates, it is critical to continue to study the impact that national and local ""social distancing"" policies have on the daily lives of individuals. The aim of this study was to examine loneliness in relation to risk assessment, measures taken against risks, concerns, and social media use, while adjusting for sociodemographic variables. The cross-sectional study collected data from 3474 individuals from the USA, the UK, Norway, and Australia. Loneliness was measured with the de Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale. Multiple linear regression was used in the analysis of associations between variables. The results showed that concerns about finances were more strongly associated with social loneliness, while concerns about the future was more strongly associated with emotional loneliness. Longer daily time spent on social media was associated with higher emotional loneliness. In conclusion, pandemic-related concerns seem to affect perceptions of loneliness. While social media can be used productively to maintain relationships, and thereby prevent loneliness, excessive use may be counterproductive.","Bonsaksen, Tore; Schoultz, Mariyana; Thygesen, Hilde; Ruffolo, Mary; Price, Daicia; Leung, Janni; Geirdal, Amy Østertun",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,476

An End of Life Companion scheme was introduced to support the delivery of care for seriously unwell and dying patients during this time. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to capture the Companions' experience and activities, including qualitative feedback, as well as outline recommendations for this role in future services and training. METHODS: The Companions service comprised of Allied Healthcare Professionals working for the Trust who volunteered for the role following a reduction in their normal workload due to COVID-19. They worked in shifts covering a 12-hour period every day of the week with patients identified by the Palliative Care team. Companions completed questionnaires containing a 4 domains mixture of Likert scale and free text responses before and after their experience. Details of the visits were recorded in daily spreadsheets. RESULTS: The majority of Companions were from the physiotherapy team with a range of experience working in the NHS. In total 64 patients were seen over 382 visits. The Companions often carried out more than one activity per visit including communication with the patient and NOK, personal care, literature and spirituality. Data showed a statistically significant association between experience as a Companion and reduced anxiety around spending time with dying people. CONCLUSION: This study highlights an interesting approach to changing job roles for healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as recognising the importance of AHPs in the multi-disciplinary approach to palliative and end of life care.","Haire, Ellen; Brown, Helen; Wiggins, Natasha",J. pain symptom manage,,476

METHODS: We examined histopathologic findings in six consecutive such cases from five patients received in mid-May to mid-June of 2020, evaluating immunohistochemical staining for the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. We compared these six cases to eight cases diagnosed as perniosis between January and June of 2019. RESULTS: Five of six lesions with perniosis-like histopathology during the COVID-19 pandemic had distinctive tight cuffing of lymphocytes; intravascular material was present in one case. SARS-CoV-2 immunohistochemical staining using an antibody directed at the nucleocapsid protein was negative in all six cases. Only one of eight specimens with microscopic findings of perniosis received prior to the COVID-19 pandemic had tightly cuffed perivascular lymphocytes, and none had obvious intravascular occlusion. CONCLUSIONS: A tightly cuffed pattern of perivascular lymphocytes is a feature of perniosis during the COVID-19 pandemic. The absence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein in these cases suggests against the virus being directly present in these lesions.","Ko, Christine J; Harigopal, Malini; Damsky, William; Gehlhausen, Jeff R; Bosenberg, Marcus; Patrignelli, Robert; McNiff, Jennifer M",J. cutan. pathol,,476

Metformin is an anti-hyperglycemic agent with host-directed immune-modulatory effects, which relieve exaggerated inflammation and reduce lung tissue damage. The current systematic review aimed to summarize the available evidence on the potential mechanism of action and the efficacy of metformin in COVID-19 patients with DM. Methods: A systematic search was carried out in PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials (CENTRAL), and Web of Science up to July 30, 2020. The following keywords were used: ""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""2019-nCoV"", ""metformin"", and ""antidiabetic drug"". Results: Fourteen studies were included in our systematic review. Three of them were observational with 6,659 participants. Decreasing insulin resistance, reduction of some inflammatory cytokines like IL-6 and TNF-&#945;, modulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, and improving neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio are some of the potential mechanisms of metformin in COVID-19 patients with DM. Nine out of fourteen articles revealed the positive effect of metformin on the prognosis of COVID-19 in diabetic or even non-diabetic patients. Moreover, different studies have shown that metformin is more effective in women than men. Conclusions: The use of metformin may lead to improve the clinical outcomes of patients with mild to moderate SARS-CoV-2, especially in diabetic women. Further observational studies should be conducted to clarify the effects of metformin as a part of the treatment strategy of COVID-19.","Zangiabadian, Moein; Nejadghaderi, Seyed Aria; Zahmatkesh, Mohammad Mahdi; Hajikhani, Bahareh; Mirsaeidi, Mehdi; Nasiri, Mohammad Javad",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),,476

It is currently unclear to what extent such antibodies are produced after non-severe disease or asymptomatic infection. We studied a cluster of SARS-CoV-2 infections among a homogeneous population of 332 predominantly male Swiss soldiers and determined the neutralizing antibody response with a serum neutralization assay using a recombinant SARS-CoV-2-GFP. All patients with non-severe COVID-19 showed a swift humoral response within two weeks after the onset of symptoms, which remained stable for the duration of the study. One month after the outbreak, titers in COVID-19 convalescents did not differ from the titers of asymptomatically infected individuals. Furthermore, symptoms of COVID-19 did not correlate with neutralizing antibody titers. Therefore, we conclude that asymptomatic infection can induce the same humoral immunity as non-severe COVID-19 in young adults.","Jonsdottir, Hulda R; Bielecki, Michel; Siegrist, Denise; Buehrer, Thomas W; Züst, Roland; Deuel, Jeremy W",Viruses,,476

This condition has caused widespread disruption of the economic, social, and educational systems in those countries. Under these conditions, transportation systems also need to be considered. There are problems of distribution of drugs and kits of test equipment to areas far from large cities in the center of the corona pandemic due to access difficulty. Remote locations, being difficult to reach, make the distribution of drugs and equipment for rapid testing uneven so that the recovery rate of patients in the area has a low percentage. Meanwhile, it is essential to ensure the availability of drugs and rapid test equipment in every public health center in all directions of Indonesia. One possible solution is the use of drones to distribute these things to areas that are difficult to reach. This solution is expected to at least improve healing and reduce mortality for patients infected with COVID-19 in remote areas.","Anggraeni, Sri; Maulidina, Aulia; Dewi, Mauseni Wantika; Rahmadianti, Salma; Rizky, Yulian Putri Chandra; Arinalhaq, Zulfa Fathi; Usdiyana, Dian; Nandiyanto, Asep Bayu Dani; Al-Obaidi, Abdulkareem Sh.

The secondary objective was to identify the predictive clinical factors for the evolution of these symptoms. METHODS: A prospective case-control study was conducted from March 15 to October 15, 2020, in health workers with COVID-19 related symptoms in a tertiary care hospital. 320 patients were included after 6 months of follow-up: 195 in the case group and 125 in the control group. Olfactory dysfunction (OD), dysosmia, and gustatory dysfunction (GD) onset and recovery rate after 6 months follow-up are analyzed in both groups. RESULTS: There were 125 (64.1%) in case group patients with OD and 118 (60.5%) with GD. Total or partial recovery OD and GD was found in 89%, mainly in the first 2 months. In the control group, there were 14 (11.2%) patients with OD and 33 (26.4%) patients with GD, with 100% of total/partial recovery. CONCLUSION: In both groups, OD and GD showed high-resolution rates during the first two months after the onset of symptoms. Nevertheless, 11% of the case group patients did not show any recovery, and the partial resolution was present in 30% of our patients, at the 6 months follow-up. We found a high correlation between OD and GD, both in the appearance of symptoms and in their recovery. Nasal obstruction and dyspnea have been identified as risk factors for the persistence of symptoms.","Riestra-Ayora, Juan; Yanes-Diaz, Joaquin; Esteban-Sanchez, Jonathan; Vaduva, Cristina; Molina-Quiros, Cristina; Larran-Jimenez, Alba; Martin-Sanz, Eduardo",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,,476

469780,Common ground how covid-19 is affecting wide-format vertical markets,2020,"BACKGROUND: Broadening our knowledge of the longitudinal course of mood symptoms is cardinal to providing effective long-term treatments. Research indicates that patients with mental illness are willing to engage in the use of telemonitoring and mobile technology to assess and monitor their mood states. However, without the provision of distant support, adverse outcomes and events may be difficult to prevent and manage through self-monitoring. Understanding patient perspectives is important to achieving the best balance of self-monitoring, patient empowerment, and distant supporter involvement. METHODS: This systematic review synthesises quantitative and qualitative evidence of the effectiveness and feasibility of daily/weekly/monthly remote mood monitoring that includes distant support in participants with mood disorders. Inclusion criteria comprised mood monitoring of mood disorder patients as main intervention, study design, method of monitoring, and presence of psychotherapy and psychoeducation. Effectiveness was defined by the change in depression and/or mania scores. Feasibility was determined on participant feedback and completion/attrition rates. Studies were assessed for quality using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool version 2018. RESULTS: Nine studies of acceptable quality met the inclusion criteria. Distant mood monitoring was effective in improving depression scores but not mania scores. Feasibility, as measured through compliance and completion rates and participant feedback, varied. CONCLUSION: Distant mood monitoring with support may be a useful, acceptable, and feasible intervention for diverse groups of patients in terms of age and ethnicity. Further, it may be effective in improving symptoms of depression, increasing treatment adherence, and facilitating the prevention and management of adverse outcomes. As a task-shifting intervention, distant mood monitoring may help to alleviate the burden on mental health providers in developing countries.","van der Watt, A S J; Odendaal, W; Louw, K; Seedat, S",BMC Psychiatry,,476

We propose a pragmatic management approach based on clinical presentation, vaccination delivery, and imaging findings. In the settings of screening mammography, screening MRI, and diagnostic imaging work-up of breast symptoms, with no imaging findings beyond unilateral axillary adenopathy ipsilateral to recent (prior six weeks) vaccination, we report the adenopathy as benign with no further imaging indicated if no nodes are palpable six weeks after the last dose. For patients with palpable axillary adenopathy in the setting of ipsilateral recent vaccination, clinical follow-up of the axilla is recommended. In all these scenarios, axillary ultrasound is recommended if clinical concern persists six weeks after vaccination. In patients with recent breast cancer diagnosis in the pre- or peri-treatment setting, prompt recommended imaging is encouraged as well as vaccination (in the thigh or contralateral arm). Our recommendations align with the ACR BI-RADS Atlas and aim to: 1) reduce patient anxiety, provider burden, and costs of unnecessary evaluation of enlarged nodes in the setting of recent vaccination, and 2) avoid further delays in vaccinations and breast cancer screening during the pandemic.","Lehman, Constance D; Lamb, Leslie R; D039,; Alessandro, Helen Anne",,,476

The data is from 2 surveys of 1,143 adults from RAND Corporation's nationally representative American Life Panel, the first administered between April-June, 2019 and the second during the initial peak of the pandemic in the United States in April, 2020. Depressive symptoms during the pandemic were higher than population norms before the pandemic. Depressive symptoms increased from before to during COVID-19 and life satisfaction decreased. Individuals with higher education experienced a greater increase in depressive symptoms and a greater decrease in life satisfaction from before to during COVID-19 in comparison to those with lower education. Supplemental analysis illustrates that income had a curvilinear relationship with changes in well-being, such that individuals at the highest levels of income experienced a greater decrease in life satisfaction from before to during COVID-19 than individuals with lower levels of income. We draw on conservation of resources theory and the theory of fundamental social causes to examine four key mechanisms (perceived financial resources, perceived control, interpersonal resources, and COVID-19-related knowledge/news consumption) underlying the relationship between SES and well-being during COVID-19. These resources explained changes in well-being for the sample as a whole but did not provide insight into why individuals of higher education experienced a greater decline in well-being from before to during COVID-19.

In this research, a complex operational environment composed of unrelated parallel machines with limited production capacity and sequence-dependent setup times and costs is studied. There is also a limited finished-goods storage capacity, a characteristic not found in the literature. Backordering is allowed but it is extremely undesirable. The problem is described through a mixed integer linear programming formulation. Since the problem is NP-hard, relax-and-fix heuristics with hybrid partitioning strategies are investigated. Computational experiments with randomly generated and also with real-world instances are presented. The results show the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed approaches. Compared to current solutions used by the company, the best proposed strategies yield results with substantially lower costs, primarily from the reduction in inventory levels and better allocation of production batches on the machines.","Araujo, K.

Targeted Learning is driven by complex problems in data science and has been implemented in a diversity of real-world scenarios: observational studies with missing treatments and outcomes, personalized interventions, longitudinal settings with time-varying treatment regimes, survival analysis, adaptive randomized trials, mediation analysis, and networks of connected subjects. In contrast to the (mis)application of restrictive modeling strategies that dominate the current practice of statistics, Targeted Learning establishes a principled standard for statistical estimation and inference (i.e., confidence intervals and p-values). This multiply robust approach is accompanied by a guiding roadmap and a burgeoning software ecosystem, both of which provide guidance on the construction of estimators optimized to best answer the motivating question. The roadmap of Targeted Learning emphasizes tailoring statistical procedures so as to minimize their assumptions, carefully grounding them only in the scientific knowledge available. The end result is a framework that honestly reflects the uncertainty in both the background knowledge and the available data in order to draw reliable conclusions from statistical analyses - ultimately enhancing the reproducibility and rigor of scientific findings.","Coyle, Jeremy R.; Hejazi, Nima S.; Malenica, Ivana; Phillips, Rachael V.; Arnold, Benjamin F.; Mertens, Andrew; Benjamin-Chung, Jade; Cai, Weixin; Dayal, Sonali; Colford, John M.; Hubbard, Alan E.; Laan, Mark J. van der",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.07333v1.pdf,476

The relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were calculated by Poisson regression (&#945; < 0.05). RESULTS: After 5-year, 31 teeth (13.6%) presented occurrence/progression of GR. In the multivariate analyses, occurrence/progression of GR was associated with the use of rubber dam isolation (RR; 95%CI: 2.65; 1.01 - 7.00) and lack of marginal adaptation of the restoration (RR; 95%CI: 10.98; 2.31 - 52.30). Toothbrush stiffness, use of abrasive dentifrice, tooth type, presence of biofilm and presence of gingivitis did not present statistically significant higher risk for occurrence/progression of GR. CONCLUSION: The use of rubber dam isolation associated with retraction clamp and the lack of a proper marginal adaptation of the composite restorations are risk indicators for the occurrence/progression of GR in individuals that received a restoration for NCCL. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Isolation with rubber dam and dental clamps may promote GR in sites with restored NCCL. Moreover, clinical examinations for lack of marginal adaptations of the restorations may be included in a clinical setting.","Favetti, Morgana; Montagner, Anelise Fernandes; Fontes, Silvia Terra; Martins, Thiago Marchi; Masotti, Alexandre Severo; Dos Santos Jardim, Patricia; Corrêa, Fernanda Oliveira Bello; Cenci, Maximiliano Sergio; Muniz, Francisco Wilker Mustafa Gomes",J Dent,,476

DESIGN: Indexed study used a mixed method design. Phase I employed qualitative methods for development of questionnaire including literature review, focus group discussion, expert evaluation and pre-testing. Phase II used quantitative methods for establishing construct validity of the questionnaire via parallel factor analysis. PARTICIPANTS: Phase 1 involved participation of experts from different fields (Departments of Medicine, Nutrition and Clinical Psychology) and general adult population. For phase II, data was collected from 124 adult respondents (female=57.26%); mean age (36±14.8) years residing in an urban setting. RESULTS: The questionnaire consisted of 3 sections: (A) socio-demographic and anthropometric parameters, (B) 24 items each for investigating the change in eating, activity and sleep behavior before versus during COVID-19, (C) 6 items assessing COVID-19 specific reasons for lifestyle change. The Cronbach's alpha value of the questionnaire is 0.72 suggesting its good internal consistency. CONCLUSIONS: This appears to be a valid tool to assess the impact of COVID-19 on lifestyle related behaviors with potential utility for public health researchers to identify these changes at community level and develop strategies to reinforce corrective behaviors.","Chopra, Sakshi; Ranjan, Piyush; Malhotra, Anita; Sahu, Anamika; Dwivedi, S N; Baitha, Upendra; Goel, Astha; Kumar, Arvind",Public Health Nutr,,476

473819,A Safety Network for Patients in Times of COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Studies of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 have found varying mortality outcomes associated with underlying respiratory conditions and inhaled corticosteroid use. Using data from a national, multicentre, prospective cohort, we aimed to characterise people with COVID-19 admitted to hospital with underlying respiratory disease, assess the level of care received, measure in-hospital mortality, and examine the effect of inhaled corticosteroid use. METHODS: We analysed data from the International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC) WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK (CCP-UK) study. All patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 across England, Scotland, and Wales between Jan 17 and Aug 3, 2020, were eligible for inclusion in this analysis. Patients with asthma, chronic pulmonary disease, or both, were identified and stratified by age (<16 years, 16-49 years, and &#8805;50 years). In-hospital mortality was measured by use of multilevel Cox proportional hazards, adjusting for demographics, comorbidities, and medications (inhaled corticosteroids, short-acting ß-agonists [SABAs], and long-acting ß-agonists [LABAs]). Patients with asthma who were taking an inhaled corticosteroid plus LABA plus another maintenance asthma medication were considered to have severe asthma. FINDINGS: 75 463 patients from 258 participating health-care facilities were included in this analysis: 860 patients younger than 16 years (74 [8·6%] with asthma), 8950 patients aged 16-49 years (1867 [20·9%] with asthma), and 65 653 patients aged 50 years and older (5918 [9·0%] with asthma, 10 266 [15·6%] with chronic pulmonary disease, and 2071 [3·2%] with both asthma and chronic pulmonary disease). Patients with asthma were significantly more likely than those without asthma to receive critical care (patients aged 16-49 years: adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1·20 [95% CI 1·05-1·37]; p=0·0080; patients aged &#8805;50 years: adjusted OR 1·17 [1·08-1·27]; p<0·0001), and patients aged 50 years and older with chronic pulmonary disease (with or without asthma) were significantly less likely than those without a respiratory condition to receive critical care (adjusted OR 0·66 [0·60-0·72] for those without asthma and 0·74 [0·62-0·87] for those with asthma; p<0·0001 for both). In patients aged 16-49 years, only those with severe asthma had a significant increase in mortality compared to those with no asthma (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1·17 [95% CI 0·73-1·86] for those on no asthma therapy, 0·99 [0·61-1·58] for those on SABAs only, 0·94 [0·62-1·43] for those on inhaled corticosteroids only, 1·02 [0·67-1·54] for those on inhaled corticosteroids plus LABAs, and 1·96 [1·25-3·08] for those with severe asthma). Among patients aged 50 years and older, those with chronic pulmonary disease had a significantly increased mortality risk, regardless of inhaled corticosteroid use, compared to patients without an underlying respiratory condition (adjusted HR 1·16 [95% CI 1·12-1·22] for those not on inhaled corticosteroids, and 1·10 [1·04-1·16] for those on inhaled corticosteroids; p<0·0001). Patients aged 50 years and older with severe asthma also had an increased mortality risk compared to those not on asthma therapy (adjusted HR 1·24 [95% CI 1·04-1·49]). In patients aged 50 years and older, inhaled corticosteroid use within 2 weeks of hospital admission was associated with decreased mortality in those with asthma, compared to those without an underlying respiratory condition (adjusted HR 0·86 [95% CI 0·80-0·92]). INTERPRETATION: Underlying respiratory conditions are common in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. Regardless of the severity of symptoms at admission and comorbidities, patients with asthma were more likely, and those with chronic pulmonary disease less likely, to receive critical care than patients without an underlying respiratory condition. In patients aged 16 years and older, severe asthma was associated with increased mortality compared to non-severe asthma. In patients aged 50 years and older, inhaled corticosteroid use in those with asthma was associated with lower mortality than in patients without an underlying respiratory condition; patients with chronic pulmonary disease had significantly increased mortality compared to those with no underlying respiratory condition, regardless of inhaled corticosteroid use. Our results suggest that the use of inhaled corticosteroids, within 2 weeks of admission, improves survival for patients aged 50 years and older with asthma, but not for those with chronic pulmonary disease.

474281,Air-travelers' concerns emerging from online comments during the COVID-19 outbreak,2021,"Most of peroxisomal matrix proteins including a hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-decomposing enzyme, catalase, are imported in a peroxisome-targeting signal type-1 (PTS1)-dependent manner. However, little is known about regulation of the membrane-bound protein import machinery. Here, we report that Pex14, a central component of the protein translocation complex in peroxisomal membrane, is phosphorylated in response to oxidative stresses such as H2O2 in mammalian cells. The H2O2-induced phosphorylation of Pex14 at Ser232 suppresses peroxisomal import of catalase in vivo and selectively impairs in vitro the interaction of catalase with the Pex14-Pex5 complex. A phosphomimetic mutant Pex14-S232D elevates the level of cytosolic catalase, but not canonical PTS1-proteins, conferring higher cell resistance to H2O2. We thus suggest that the H2O2-induced phosphorylation of Pex14 spatiotemporally regulates peroxisomal import of catalase, functioning in counteracting action against oxidative stress by the increase of cytosolic catalase.","Okumoto, Kanji; Shermely, Mahmoud El; Natsui, Masanao; Kosako, Hidetaka; Natsuyama, Ryuichi; Marutani, Toshihiro; Fujiki, Yukio",eLife (Cambridge),,476

Most of the reports are from Europe, USA or China. Our study aimed to capture data on varied and unusual clinical presentation and management of MIS-C (Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children) with COVID-19 and compare the MIS-C and non-MIS-C children. This was a single-centre cohort study of 41 COVID positive children 0-12 years age hospitalized between 1 April 2020 and 31 July 2020. Data were entered into standardized WHO Case Report Form and analysed using strata 15.0 statistical software. Twenty out of 41 children fulfilled the criteria of MIS-C. Male-to-female ratio in the cohort was 1.73:1. In MIS-C cases, predominant clinical manifestation was fever (100%), neurological manifestations (80%), lower respiratory tract infection (50%), rash (35%) and acute gastroenteritis (25%). They were categorized into Acute Encephalitis-like illness in 35%, Kawasaki-like disease, Toxic Shock-like syndrome and Comorbidity with systemic complications in 20% each. Ninety percent of MIS-C cases required oxygen supplementation with odds ratio (OR) 18 (3.22-100.48), whereas 65% required mechanical ventilation with OR 37.14 (4.08-338.10). Most of them had raised inflammatory markers and hepatic enzymes derangement. Steroids, Intravenous immunoglobulin and supportive therapy were mainstay of management for MIS-C group. Most MIS-C group children had multisystem involvement with predominant neurological manifestations at time of presentation. Delay in diagnosis and referral may have adversely affected the prognosis and outcome.","Gupta Dch, Shobhna; Chopra Md, Nidhi; Singh Md, Amitabh; Gera, Rani; Chellani Md, Harish; Pandey PhD, Ravindra; Arora Md, Balvinder Singh",J. trop. pedriatr,,476

474544,COVID-19: Nowcasting Reproduction Factors Using Biased Case Testing Data,2020-05-25,"Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) utilizes the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor to enter human cells. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin II receptor antagonists (ARB) are associated with ACE-2 upregulation. We hypothesized that antecedent use of ACEI/ARB may be associated with mortality in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods and Results We used the Coracle registry, which contains data of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in 4 regions of Italy, and restricted analyses to those &#8805;50 years of age. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Among these 781 patients, 133 (17.0%) used an ARB and 171 (21.9%) used an ACEI. While neither sex nor smoking status differed by user groups, patients on ACEI/ARB were older and more likely to have hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and congestive heart failure. The overall mortality rate was 15.1% (118/781) and increased with age (PTrend<0.0001). The crude odds ratios (ORs) for death for ACEI users and ARB users were 0.98, 95% CI, 0.60-1.60, P=0.9333, and 1.13, 95% CI, 0.67-1.91, P=0.6385, respectively. After adjusting for age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and congestive heart failure, antecedent ACEI administration was associated with reduced mortality (OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.31-0.98, P=0.0436); a similar, but weaker trend was observed for ARB administration (OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.32-1.07, P=0.0796). Conclusions In those aged &#8805;50 years hospitalized with COVID-19, antecedent use of ACEI was independently associated with reduced risk of inpatient death. Our findings suggest a protective role of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibition in patients with high cardiovascular risk affected by COVID-19.","Palazzuoli, Alberto; Mancone, Massimo; De Ferrari, Gaetano M; Forleo, Giovanni; Secco, Gioel G; Ruocco, Gaetano M; D039,; Ascenzo, Fabrizio; Monticone, Silvia; Paggi, Anita; Vicenzi, Marco; Palazzo, Anna G; Landolina, Maurizio; Taravelli, Erika; Tavazzi, Guido; Blasi, Francesco; Infusino, Fabio; Fedele, Francesco; De Rosa, Francesco G; Emmett, Michael; Schussler, Jeffrey M; Tecson, Kristen M; McCullough, Peter A",J Am Heart Assoc,,476

475034,Die COVID-19 Pandemie hat uns weiter fest im Griff,2021,"BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread rapidly around the globe since December 2019 creating much uncertainty among medical staff. Due to close patient contact, medical assistants are at increased risk of an infection. Several studies have investigated psychological consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on medical staff, yet studies in the outpatient setting are scarce and studies addressing medical assistants are lacking. This study aimed to investigate pandemic-related stressors, attitudes, and work outcomes among medical assistants and to identify possible determinants. METHODS: The population under study were medical assistants across entire Germany. A self-devised online questionnaire was published between April 7th, 2020, and April 14th. including questions on pandemic-related stressors, attitudes and work outcomes. Additionally, symptoms of depression and anxiety disorder were measured by PHQ-2 and GAD-2, respectively. Logistic regression was performed to identify possible determinants. RESULTS: 2150 medical assistants provided complete data (98.0% female, mean age 37.6 years). Major stressors were uncertainty about the temporal scope of the pandemic (95.1% agreement), about how to act correctly (77.5%), feelings of not being allowed to let patients down (75.9%), uncertainty about one's financial situation (67.4%) and about contact persons for further information (67.1%). One third (29.9%) of the study population screened positively for depression and 42.6% for anxiety disorder. Feeling burdened by one's financial situation was significantly associated with working in specialist practices (1.32 [1.08-1.62]), caring for children (1.51 [1.22-1.87]), depression (1.28 [1.01-1.62]), and anxiety disorder (1.93 [1.55-2.39]). Feeling burdened by thoughts about virus contraction at work was also significantly associated with working in specialist practices (1.33 [1.07-1.64]), caring for children (1.33 [1.07-1.66]), depression (1.54 [1.18-2.00]), and anxiety (4.71 [3.71-5.98]). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides novel evidence regarding major SARS-CoV-2 pandemic-related stressors among medical assistants and suggests need for special support for medical assistants caring for children and working in specialist practices.","Dreher, Annegret; Pietrowsky, Reinhard; Loerbroks, Adrian",PLoS One,,476

The objective of this study was to determine the health facility (HF) preparedness for RMNH service delivery during the outbreak from the perspective of RMNH providers and to determine what factors significantly predict this. An anonymous cross-sectional online survey of RMNH providers was conducted from to July 1-21, 2020 in Lagos State, Nigeria. We conducted a descriptive and ordinal regression analysis, with RMNH worker perception of HF preparedness for RMNH service delivery during the outbreak as the dependent variable. In all, 256 RMNH workers participated, 35.2% reported that RMNH services were unavailable at some time since March 2020, 87.1% felt work-related burnout, 97.7% were concerned about the availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) and related guidelines, and only 11.7% were satisfied with the preparedness of their HFs. Our final model was a statistically significant predictor of RMNH worker perception of HF preparedness explaining 54.7% of the variation observed. The most significant contribution to the model was communication by HF management (likelihood ratio chi-square [LRCS]: 87.94, P &lt; 0.001) and the availability of PPE and COVID-19 guidelines (LRCS: 15.43, P &lt; 0.001). A one-unit increase in the level of concern about the availability of PPE and COVID-19 guidelines would increase the odds of observing a higher category of satisfaction with HF COVID-19 preparedness. Adequate support of RMNH providers, particularly provision of PPE and guidelines, and appropriate communications about COVID-19 should be prioritized as part of HF preparedness","Afolabi, B.

Using a plaque reduction assay, we compare inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 by heparin, pentosan sulfate, linear polyglycerol sulfate (LPGS) and hyperbranched polyglycerol sulfate (HPGS). Highly sulfated LPGS is the optimal inhibitor, with an IC50 of 67â µg mL-1 (approx. 1.6â µm). This synthetic polysulfate exhibits more than 60-fold higher virus inhibitory activity than heparin (IC50 : 4084â µg mL-1 ), along with much lower anticoagulant activity. Furthermore, in molecular dynamics simulations, we verified that LPGS can bind more strongly to the spike protein than heparin, and that LPGS can interact even more with the spike protein of the new N501Y and E484K variants. Our study demonstrates that the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells can be blocked via electrostatic interactions, therefore LPGS can serve as a blueprint for the design of novel viral inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2.","Nie, Chuanxiong; Pouyan, Paria; Lauster, Daniel; Trimpert, Jakob; Kerkhoff, Yannic; Szekeres, Gergo Peter; Wallert, Matthias; Block, Stephan; Sahoo, Anil Kumar; Dernedde, Jens; Pagel, Kevin; Kaufer, Benedikt B; Netz, Roland R; Ballauff, Matthias; Haag, Rainer",Angew Chem Int Ed Engl,,476

Anaesthetists and intensivists were anticipated to be at the highest risk of work-related infection due to involvement in airway management and management of critical illness and therefore wear the highest levels of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the hospital. However, the data clearly show that those working in anaesthesia and critical care settings are at lower risk of infection, harm and death from COVID-19 than colleagues working on the wards. The observed safety of anaesthetists and intensivists and increased risk to those in other patient-facing roles has implications for transmission-based infection control precautions. The precautionary principle supports extending training in and use of airborne precaution PPE to all staff working in patient-facing roles who have close contact with coughing patients. This will both reduce their risk of contracting COVID-19, maintain services and reduce nosocomial transmission to vulnerable patients. The emergence of a new variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with significantly higher transmissibility creates urgency to addressing this matter.","Cook, Tim M; El-Boghdadly, Kariem; Brown, Jules; Pickering, Anthony E",Clin Med (Lond),,476

In the present study, 13 TE (Hg, Pb, Cd, Cu, As, Se, Zn, Cr, V, Fe, Ni, Co, and Mn) were analyzed in the muscle tissue of three shark species (Prionace glauca, Carcharhinus falciformis, and Alopias pelagicus) using high-resolution mass spectrometry inductively coupled to a plasma generator (HR-ICP-MS); 30 shark specimens of each specie were obtained during commercial fish landings in the port of Manzanillo, Mexico. The morphometric characteristics and sex of the sharks were recorded. Shark A. pelagicus accumulated higher concentrations of TE, especially for Hg and Cd, than the other species. Significant differences in the TE levels were detected between sexes in P. glauca and A. pelagicus; in all cases, the highest concentrations were found in female muscle tissue. The ability of sharks to bioaccumulate ETs depends of the metals (essentials higher than non-essential) but is explained mainly by feeding habits associated to sexes (population segregation) and size (ontogeny). The association between TE in shark specimens was related to the essentiality, their antagonistic action, and origin.

However, little is known about the underlying mechanism of change. The present study aimed to examine if optimism and social connectedness mediated the relationship between coronavirus stress and COVID-19 burnout in a large sample of healthcare staffs. Participants included 1046 healthcare staffs (56.8% females) aged 20-61 years (mean age = 30.29 years, SD = 7.80), who completed the measures of coronavirus stress, optimism, social connectedness, and COVID-19 burnout. Females reported more coronavirus stress and burnout and less social connectedness. People confirmed with COVID-19 reported lower optimism. The results indicated that coronavirus stress did not only have a direct effect on increased COVID-19 burnout but also had an indirect effect on it through reduced optimism and social connectedness. These results are important given the shortage of intervention efforts targeting coronavirus stress. Future intervention efforts aimed at reducing coronavirus stress and related outcomes may benefit from simultaneously focusing on optimism and social connectedness.","Yildirim, Murat; Çiçek, Ilhan; Sanli, Mehmet Emin",Curr Psychol,,476

To date, March 1, 2021, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused about 114 million accumulated cases and 2.53 million deaths worldwide. Previous pieces of evidence suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may affect the central nervous system (CNS) and cause neurological symptoms in COVID-19 patients. It is also known that angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), the primary receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection, is expressed in different brain areas and cell types. Thus, it is hypothesized that infection by this virus could generate or exacerbate neuropathological alterations. However, the molecular mechanisms that link COVID-19 disease and nerve damage are unclear. In this review, we describe the routes of SARS-CoV-2 invasion into the central nervous system. We also analyze the neuropathologic mechanisms underlying this viral infection, and their potential relationship with the neurological manifestations described in patients with COVID-19, and the appearance or exacerbation of some neurodegenerative diseases.","Pacheco-Herrero, M.; Soto-Rojas, L.

Materials and Methods: Mental health clinicians were surveyed with 27 Likert questions, using previously validated measures, on satisfaction and implementation experience with video telehealth visits between March and June 2020. Results: A total of 112 of 193 clinicians completed the survey (58.0%), including psychiatrists, psychologists, trainees (i.e., residents and fellows), advanced practice providers, and licensed mental health counselors. Clinicians reported high levels of acceptability, feasibility, and appropriateness of video telehealth; they also reported high levels of satisfaction with video telehealth visits. Seventy-nine and a half (79.5%) reported that their patients seemed highly satisfied with video telehealth visits, and 107 (95.5%) of clinicians responded that they would like video telehealth visits to represent at least 25% of their practice in the future. Discussion: Mental health clinicians showed positive attitudes toward the implementation of video telehealth visits, high levels of satisfaction with this care, and indicated strong interest in continuing this modality as a significant portion of clinical practice. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the ability of mental health clinicians to embrace new technology to expand access to care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results indicate that telemental health is likely to be an integral part of clinic practice in the future.","Gentry, Melanie T; Puspitasari, Ajeng J; McKean, Alastair J; Williams, Mark D; Breitinger, Scott; Geske, Jennifer R; Clark, Matthew M; Moore, Katherine M; Frye, Mark A; Hilty, Donald M",Telemed. j. e. health,,476

Many countries have implemented restrictions on population movement to slow the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and prevent health systems from becoming overwhelmed; some have instituted full or partial lockdowns. However, lockdowns and other extreme restrictions cannot be sustained for the long term in the hope that there will be an effective vaccine or treatment for COVID-19. Governments worldwide now face the common challenge of easing lockdowns and restrictions while balancing various health, social, and economic concerns. To facilitate cross-country learning, this Health Policy paper uses an adapted framework to examine the approaches taken by nine high-income countries and regions that have started to ease COVID-19 restrictions: five in the Asia Pacific region (ie, Hong Kong [Special Administrative Region], Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea) and four in Europe (ie, Germany, Norway, Spain, and the UK). This comparative analysis presents important lessons to be learnt from the experiences of these countries and regions.

479663,Educational continuity in the Covid-19 test,2020,"A central paradigm of immunity is that interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral responses precede pro-inflammatory ones, optimizing host protection and minimizing collateral damage1,2. Here, we report that for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) this paradigm does not apply. By investigating temporal IFN and inflammatory cytokine patterns in 32 moderate-to-severe patients with COVID-19 hospitalized for pneumonia and longitudinally followed for the development of respiratory failure and death, we reveal that IFN-&#955; and type I IFN production were both diminished and delayed, induced only in a fraction of patients as they became critically ill. On the contrary, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 were produced before IFNs in all patients and persisted for a prolonged time. This condition was reflected in blood transcriptomes wherein prominent IFN signatures were only seen in critically ill patients who also exhibited augmented inflammation. By comparison, in 16 patients with influenza (flu) hospitalized for pneumonia with similar clinicopathological characteristics to those of COVID-19 and 24 nonhospitalized patients with flu with milder symptoms, IFN-&#955; and type I IFN were robustly induced earlier, at higher levels and independently of disease severity, whereas pro-inflammatory cytokines were only acutely produced. Notably, higher IFN-&#955; concentrations in patients with COVID-19 correlated with lower viral load in bronchial aspirates and faster viral clearance and a higher IFN-&#955; to type I IFN ratio correlated with improved outcome for critically ill patients. Moreover, altered cytokine patterns in patients with COVID-19 correlated with longer hospitalization and higher incidence of critical disease and mortality compared to flu. These data point to an untuned antiviral response in COVID-19, contributing to persistent viral presence, hyperinflammation and respiratory failure.","Galani, Ioanna-Evdokia; Rovina, Nikoletta; Lampropoulou, Vicky; Triantafyllia, Vasiliki; Manioudaki, Maria; Pavlos, Eleftherios; Koukaki, Evangelia; Fragkou, Paraskevi C; Panou, Vasiliki; Rapti, Vasiliki; Koltsida, Ourania; Mentis, Andreas; Koulouris, Nikolaos; Tsiodras, Sotirios; Koutsoukou, Antonia; Andreakos, Evangelos",Nat. immunol,,476

Guidelines to protect patients and staff emerged and changed rapidly based on expert opinion and limited evidence. This paper presents the experiences and innovations developed by international surgical teams during the early stages of the pandemic to attempt to mitigate risk. DESIGN: In-depth, semistructured interviews were audio recorded, transcribed and analysed thematically using methods of constant comparison. PARTICIPANTS: 43 participants, including surgeons from a range of specialties (primarily general surgery, otolaryngology, neurosurgery, cardiothoracic and ophthalmology), anaesthetists and those in nursing roles. SETTING: The UK, Italy, Spain, the USA, China and New Zealand between March and May 2020. RESULTS: Surgical teams sought to mitigate COVID-19 risks by modifying their current practice with an abundance of strategies and innovations. Communication and teamwork played an integral role in how teams adapted, although participants reflected on the challenges of having to improvise in real time. Uncertainties remained about optimal surgical practice and there were significant tensions where teams were forced to balance what was best for patients while contemplating their own safety. CONCLUSIONS: The perceptions of risks during a pandemic such as COVID-19 can be complex and context dependent. Management of these risks in surgery must be driven by evidence-based practice resulting from a pragmatic and novel approach to collation of global evidence. The context of surgery has changed dramatically, and surgical teams have developed a plethora of innovations. There is an urgent need for high-quality evidence to inform surgical practice that optimises the safety of both patients and healthcare professionals as the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds.","Elliott, Daisy; Ochieng, Cynthia; Jepson, Marcus; Blencowe, Natalie S; Avery, Kerry Nl; Paramasivan, Sangeetha; Cousins, Sian; Skilton, Anni; Hutchinson, Peter; Jayne, David; Birchall, Martin; Blazeby, Jane M; Donovan, Jenny L; Rooshenas, Leila",BMJ Open,,476

480804,COVID-19 and the global OHCA crisis: An urgent need for system level solutions,2020,"BACKGROUND: Whereas several predictors of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy have been reported, the role of cognitive function is largely unknown. Accordingly, our objective was to evaluate the association between scores from an array of cognitive function tests and self-reported vaccine hesitancy after the announcement of the successful testing of the first COVID-19 vaccine (Oxford University/AstraZeneca). METHODS: We used individual-level data from a pandemic-focused study ('COVID Survey'), a prospective cohort study nested within United Kingdom Understanding Society ('Main Survey'). In the week immediately following the announcement of successful testing of the first efficacious inoculation (November/December 2020), data on vaccine intentionality were collected in 11,740 individuals (6702 women) aged 16-95 years. Pre-pandemic scores on general cognitive function, ascertained from a battery of six tests, were captured in 2011/12 wave of the Main Survey. Study members self-reported their intention to take up a vaccination in the COVID-19 Survey. RESULTS: Of the study sample, 17.2% (N = 1842) indicated they were hesitant about having the vaccine. After adjustment for age, sex, and ethnicity, study members with a lower baseline cognition score were markedly more likely to be vaccine hesitant (odds ratio per standard deviation lower score in cognition; 95% confidence interval: 1.76; 1.62, 1.90). Adjustment for mental and physical health plus household shielding status had no impact on these results, whereas controlling for educational attainment led to partial attenuation but the probability of hesitancy was still elevated (1.52; 1.37, 1.67). There was a linear association for vaccine hesitancy across the full range of cognition scores (p for trend: p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Erroneous social media reports might have complicated personal decision-making, leading to people with lower cognitive ability being vaccine-hesitant. With individuals with lower cognition also experiencing higher rates of COVID-19 in studies conducted prior to vaccine distribution, these new findings are suggestive of a potential additional disease burden.","Batty, G David; Deary, Ian J; Fawns-Ritchie, Chloe; Gale, Catharine R; Altschul, Drew",Brain Behav Immun,,476

Methods: An electronic questionnaire was administered to the students attending three Italian universities. Results: A good level of knowledge about the epidemic and its control was registered in the sample, mainly among students attending life sciences degree courses. The majority of the students did not modify their diet and smoking habits, while a great part of the sample reported a decrease in physical activity (PA). Conclusions: Students from life sciences courses showed a higher awareness regarding the infection and the control measures. The lockdown caused an important reduction of PA.

Over the last few years, this brave new world has made remarkable progress, offering opportunities to address historical clinical challenges in pulmonary diseases including multidrug resistance, adverse side effects of conventional therapeutic agents, novel imaging, and earlier disease detection. Nanomedicine is also being applied to tackle the new emerging infectious diseases, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), influenza A virus subtype H1N1 (A/H1N1), and more recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In this review we provide both a historical overview of the application of nanomedicine to respiratory diseases and more recent cutting-edge approaches such as nanoparticle-mediated combination therapies, novel double-targeted nondrug delivery system for targeting, stimuli-responsive nanoparticles, and theranostic imaging in the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary diseases.","Doroudian, Mohammad; O039,; Neill, Andrew; Mac Loughlin, Ronan; Prina-Mello, Adriele; Volkov, Yuri; Donnelly, Seamas C",Curr Opin Pharmacol,,476

We studied 37 asymptomatic individuals in the Wanzhou District who were diagnosed with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections but without any relevant clinical symptoms in the preceding 14 d and during hospitalization. Asymptomatic individuals were admitted to the government-designated Wanzhou People's Hospital for centralized isolation in accordance with policy1. The median duration of viral shedding in the asymptomatic group was 19 d (interquartile range (IQR), 15-26 d). The asymptomatic group had a significantly longer duration of viral shedding than the symptomatic group (log-rank P = 0.028). The virus-specific IgG levels in the asymptomatic group (median S/CO, 3.4; IQR, 1.6-10.7) were significantly lower (P = 0.005) relative to the symptomatic group (median S/CO, 20.5; IQR, 5.8-38.2) in the acute phase. Of asymptomatic individuals, 93.3% (28/30) and 81.1% (30/37) had reduction in IgG and neutralizing antibody levels, respectively, during the early convalescent phase, as compared to 96.8% (30/31) and 62.2% (23/37) of symptomatic patients. Forty percent of asymptomatic individuals became seronegative and 12.9% of the symptomatic group became negative for IgG in the early convalescent phase. In addition, asymptomatic individuals exhibited lower levels of 18 pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. These data suggest that asymptomatic individuals had a weaker immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The reduction in IgG and neutralizing antibody levels in the early convalescent phase might have implications for immunity strategy and serological surveys.","Long, Quan-Xin; Tang, Xiao-Jun; Shi, Qiu-Lin; Li, Qin; Deng, Hai-Jun; Yuan, Jun; Hu, Jie-Li; Xu, Wei; Zhang, Yong; Lv, Fa-Jin; Su, Kun; Zhang, Fan; Gong, Jiang; Wu, Bo; Liu, Xia-Mao; Li, Jin-Jing; Qiu, Jing-Fu; Chen, Juan; Huang, Ai-Long",Nat. med,,476
483061,Deconditioning as main mechanism of impaired exercise response in COVID-19 survivors,2021,"Lung ultrasound (LUS) is widely used in intensive care units because it provides timely information noninvasively. The use of LUS is recommended to minimize transfers in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during the pandemic. The clinical efficacies of bedside chest X-ray (CXR) and LUS have not been compared in these patients. Herein, we demonstrated serial LUS changes in a 75-year-old woman recovering from COVID-19 with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in need of veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. LUS initially revealed extensive consolidation in the bilateral lower lung (BLL) fields with coalescent B-lines. While the patient recovered from ARDS, the findings gradually changed to discrete B-lines and small pleural consolidations. The LUS findings were more sensitive than those of the CXR in detecting re-expansion of the lungs by showing B-lines instead of consolidations in the BLL fields immediately after recruitment maneuver (RM). Compared with physiological parameters, LUS findings provided more precise information about the parts of the lungs that had been recruited by RM. Therefore, we encourage intensivists to extend their use of LUS in critically ill patients with COVID-19 and ARDS to acquire real-time information for a quick response and minimize the risk of viral transmission.","Hsiao, Yi-Han; Lin, Yi-Tsung; Liao, Hsien-Tzung; Yang, Kuang-Yao; Chen, Yuh-Min",J Chin Med Assoc,,476

Hypertension (HT) and age are the two principal determinants of arterial stiffness (AS). The objective of this study is to estimate AS in COVID-19 patients requiring hospital admission and analyze its association with all-cause mortality. Design and method: This cross-sectional, observational, retrospective multicenter study includes 122170 patients who required hospital admission in 150 Spanish centers, included in the nationwide SEMI-COVID-19 Network. We compared estimated AS as pulse pressure &gt; 60 mmHg and compared clinical characteristics between survivors and nonsurvivors. Results: Mean age was 67.5±16.1 years, 42.5% were women. Most patients were white (90.0%). Globally, 2606 (21.4%) subjects died. Blood pressure (BP) &lt; 120 mmHg and BP &gt; 140 at admission predicted higher all-cause mortality (23.5% and 22.8%, respectively, p&lt;0.001), compared to BP between 120-140 mmHg (18.6%). 4379 patients with AS (36.0%) were older and had higher systolic and lower diastolic BP.

While we must be vigilant about preventing unnecessary deaths caused by coronavirus outbreaks in nursing homes, some deaths of our elders are inevitable. Thus, it is essential that advanced care planning occurs in a way that upholds the familial and relational aspects of elders' lives that often matter to them the most. We invoke concepts from feminist ethicists like Hilde Lindemann and Eva Kittay and introduce Avery Weisman and Thomas Hackett's concept of ""appropriate death"" to suggest better ways of planning for those deaths of our elderly that cannot be avoided.

Superantigen specificity for different Vß chains results in Vß skewing, whereby T cells with specific Vß chains and diverse antigen specificity are overrepresented in the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire. Here, we characterized the TCR repertoire of MIS-C patients and found a profound expansion of TCRß variable gene 11-2 (TRBV11-2), with up to 24% of clonal T cell space occupied by TRBV11-2 T cells, which correlated with MIS-C severity and serum cytokine levels. Analysis of TRBJ gene usage and complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) length distribution of MIS-C expanded TRBV11-2 clones revealed extensive junctional diversity. Patients with TRBV11-2 expansion shared HLA class I alleles A02, B35, and C04, indicating what we believe is a novel mechanism for CDR3-independent T cell expansion. In silico modeling indicated that polyacidic residues in the Vß chain encoded by TRBV11-2 (Vß21.3) strongly interact with the superantigen-like motif of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, suggesting that unprocessed SARS-CoV-2 spike may directly mediate TRBV11-2 expansion. Overall, our data indicate that a CDR3-independent interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike and TCR leads to T cell expansion and possibly activation, which may account for the clinical presentation of MIS-C.","Porritt, Rebecca A; Paschold, Lisa; Rivas, Magali Noval; Cheng, Mary Hongying; Yonker, Lael M; Chandnani, Harsha; Lopez, Merrick; Simnica, Donjete; Schultheiß, Christoph; Santiskulvong, Chintda; Van Eyk, Jennifer; McCormick, John K; Fasano, Alessio; Bahar, Ivet; Binder, Mascha; Arditi, Moshe",J. clin. invest,,476

There is limited information about prognostic markers that could help clinicians to identify COVID-19 patients with a poor prognosis. Serum levels of the immune activation marker neopterin has shown to be of prognostic value in patients with SARS. The aim of this study was to investigate whether serum neopterin is associated with the severity of COVID-19. METHODS: We included 34 patients with confirmed COVID-19 between March 3 and March 30, 2020. Fifteen patients had mild disease and did not require hospitalization, whereas 19 patients developed severe COVID-19 requiring intensive care. Concentrations of serum neopterin, tryptophan, and kynurenine were measured at and repeatedly after inclusion. RESULTS: We found a more than two-fold higher mean concentration of neopterin in severely ill patients (mean value 42.0 nmol/L (SD 18.2)) compared to patients with mild symptoms (16.9 nmol/L (SD 11.0)). All of the severe cases had elevated neopterin concentrations (> 9.1 nmol/L) at the initial sampling with values ranging from 17.2 to 86.7 nmol/L. In comparison, 10 of 15 patients with mild disease had neopterin levels above 9.1 nmol/L, with concentrations in the range from 4.9 to 31.6 nmol/L. Neopterin levels gradually decreased during the course of COVID-19, but severe cases maintained elevated levels for a longer period. Moreover, lower levels of tryptophan and higher levels of kynurenine, indicating an increased tryptophan catabolism, were seen in the group with severe cases. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we found that serum neopterin levels are associated with the severity of COVID-19. Our findings suggest that neopterin could be used as a prognostic marker, but further studies are needed to elucidate how it can be used in the clinic.","Robertson, Josefina; Gostner, Johanna M; Nilsson, Staffan; Andersson, Lars-Magnus; Fuchs, Dietmar; Gisslen, Magnus",BMC Infect Dis,,476

In a subsample of patients with HRQOL assessment available from both before and during the pandemic, we evaluated the pandemic's impact on longitudinal changes in HRQOL reported within 6 months before versus during the COVID-19 lockdown using McNemar's test, and thresholds for clinical importance. RESULTS: We consecutively enrolled 240 patients with solid (50%) or hematological (50%) cancers. Median age was 67 years, 46% were females. The majority ranked heeding their health (80%) and keeping their appointment schedule in hospital (78%) as important. Being younger than 60, or aged 60-70 was independently associated with limitations in everyday life (OR = 3.57, p < 0.001; and 2.05, p = 0.038); female individuals and those with restricted emotional functioning were more distressed by the COVID-19 situation (OR = 2.47, p = 0.040; and 3.17, p = 0.019); the latter group was also significantly more concerned about being a patient at risk (OR = 2.21, p = 0.029). Interestingly, in a subsample of patients (n = 47), longitudinal comparisons pre- versus during the pandemic revealed that HRQOL was not substantially affected by the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Particularly younger and female cancer patients, and those with impaired emotional functioning are distressed by COVID-19. During the first COVID-19 lockdown, cancer patients remained predominantly resilient. This analysis highlights the need to mitigate distress situations in vulnerable patients and thereby enhance resilience during pandemics.","Koinig, Karin A; Arnold, Christoph; Lehmann, Jens; Giesinger, Johannes; Köck, Stefan; Willenbacher, Wolfgang; Weger, Roman; Holzner, Bernhard; Ganswindt, Ute; Wolf, Dominik; Stauder, Reinhard",Cancer Med,,476

As a result, clinical decisions to optimize maternal and fetal benefit, particularly in patients with critical COVID-19 in the early preterm period, continue to be a challenge for obstetricians. There is often uncertainty in clinical judgment about fetal monitoring, timing of delivery, and mode of delivery because of the challenge in balancing maternal and fetal interests in reducing morbidity and mortality. The obstetrician and critical care team should empower pregnant patients or their surrogate decision maker to make informed decisions in response to the team's clinical evaluation. A clinically grounded ethical framework, based on the concepts of the moral management of medical uncertainty, beneficence-based obligations, and preventive ethics, should guide the decision-making process.","Gulersen, Moti; Rochelson, Burton; Bornstein, Eran; McCullough, Laurence B; Chervenak, Frank A",J. perinat. med,,476

The government closed borders, prohibited travel, limited outdoor movements, and told primary and secondary care facilities to reduce all regular non-urgent health services. It is not known whether these measures have impacted the prevalence of parasitic intestinal infections. This study has therefore been carried out to investigate this issue. Dataset of 217 stool samples submitted to the King Faisal Medical Complex (KFMC) Microbiology Laboratory in Taif, Saudi Arabia for parasitological examination during the pandemic (January-June 2020) and 649 samples submitted during the corresponding months of the previous year (January-June 2019) were extracted and analyzed. Overall, 24.1% (209/866) of samples were parasitespositives; 26.6% (173/649) before and 16.5% (36/217) during the pandemic, with 79% reduction. There was a significant difference in gender-parasitism between the two periods where the majority of parasitism were for males (p<0.001). Infections were frequent in patients aged 5- 14 years both before (84/649; 12.9%) and during (12/217; 5.5%) the pandemic, with significant difference observed between the two cohorts (p<0.002). Moreover, the majority of infected patients were non-Saudi (67.9%; 142/209), with a significant difference in nationality reported, (p=0.024). Protozoa were identified in 21.8% (189) of all samples investigated, of which, Blastocystis hominis, Entamoeba coli, Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba histolytica/dispar and Cryptosporidium species were identified in 6.1% (53), 5.4% (47), 5.0% (44), 2.8% (25), and 2.3% (20), respectively. Helminths were diagnosed in 2.3% (20/866) of samples. Eggs of hookworm, Ascaris, Taenia spp, and Hymenolepis nana were detected in 0.9% (8), 0.5% (5), 0.3% (3) and 0.4% (4), respectively.

However, little is known about what factors may make pediatric subspeciality care more apt to long-term adoption of telemedicine. To better delineate the potential patient, provider, and subspecialty factors which may influence subspecialty adoption of telemedicine, we reviewed our institutional experience. The top 36 pediatric subspecialties at Stanford Children's Health were classified into high telemedicine adopters, low telemedicine adopters, and telemedicine reverters. Distance from the patient's home, primary language, insurance type, institutional factors such as wait times, and subspecialty-specific clinical differences correlated with differing patterns of telemedicine adoption. With greater awareness of these factors, institutions and providers can better guide patients in determining which care may be best suited for telemedicine and develop sustainable long-term telemedicine programming.","Xie, J.; Prahalad, P.; Lee, T.

The detection of SARS-CoV-2 and human enteric pathogens in wastewater can provide an early warning of disease outbreak. Herein, a sensitive, multiplexed colorimetric detection (termed “SMCD”) method was established for pathogen detection in wastewater samples. The SMCD method integrated on-chip nucleic acid extraction, two-stage isothermal amplification and colorimetric detection on a 3D printed microfluidic chip. The colorimetric signal during nucleic acid amplification was recorded in real-time and analyzed by a programmed smartphone without the need for complicated equipment. By combining two-stage isothermal amplification assay into the integrated microfluidic platform, we detected SARS-CoV-2 and human enteric pathogens with sensitivities of 100 genome equivalent (GE)/mL and 500 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL, respectively, in wastewater within one hour. Additionally, we realized smart, connected, on-site detection with a reporting framework embedded in a portable detection platform, which exhibited potential for rapid spatiotemporal epidemiologic data collection regarding the environmental dynamics, transmission, and persistence of infectious diseases.","Yin, Kun Ding Xiong Xu Zhiheng Li Ziyue Wang Xingyu Zhao Hui Otis Clifford Li Baikun Liu Changchun",Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical,,476
487192,Conceptualizing research ethics in response to COVID-19 Moral and economic contradictions,2020,"BACKGROUND: The year 2020 presented the transfusion community with unprecedented events and challenges, including the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic, and more recently by civil unrest, following the death of George Floyd in late May of 2020. As a level 1 trauma center located in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Hennepin Healthcare (HCMC) offers a unique perspective into the changes in massive transfusion protocol (MTP) activations and usage during this tumultuous period. This may provide insight for addressing similar future events. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: MTP logs from March 2020 to August 2020 were compared to logs from March to August 2019. The data were de-identified, and MTP activations and component usage were categorized by activation reason. These categories were compared across the 2-year period to examine the impact of COVID-19, including stay-at-home orders, and civil unrest. RESULTS: For the examined 6 months of the year 2020, there were a total of 140 MTP activations, compared to 143 in 2019. There were more activations for violent trauma (VT) in 2020 than 2019 (44 vs. 32). This increase in activations for VT was offset by a decrease in non-trauma activations (54 vs. 66). There was a significant increase in the number of components used in VT activations. DISCUSSION: During 2020, the initial mild decrease in MTP activations was followed by a dramatic increase in the number of activations and component usage for VT in June and July of that year.","Braun, Alexander L; Gorlin, Jed B; Peters, Jessica; Murphy, Sherrie; Van Buren, Nancy L",Transfusion,,476
487818,O17 Physiotherapy experience of treating patients with PIMS-TR COVID-19 following stepdown from PICU,2020,"BACKGROUND: Before the advent of an effective vaccine, nonpharmaceutical interventions, such as mask-wearing, social distancing, and lockdowns, have been the primary measures to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Such measures are highly effective when there is high population-wide adherence, which requires information on current risks posed by the pandemic alongside a clear exposition of the rules and guidelines in place. OBJECTIVE: Here we analyzed online news media coverage of COVID-19. We quantified the total volume of COVID-19 articles, their sentiment polarization, and leading subtopics to act as a reference to inform future communication strategies. METHODS: We collected 26 million news articles from the front pages of 172 major online news sources in 11 countries (available online at SciRide). Using topic detection, we identified COVID-19-related content to quantify the proportion of total coverage the pandemic received in 2020. The sentiment analysis tool Vader was employed to stratify the emotional polarity of COVID-19 reporting. Further topic detection and sentiment analysis was performed on COVID-19 coverage to reveal the leading themes in pandemic reporting and their respective emotional polarizations. RESULTS: We found that COVID-19 coverage accounted for approximately 25.3% of all front-page online news articles between January and October 2020. Sentiment analysis of English-language sources revealed that overall COVID-19 coverage was not exclusively negatively polarized, suggesting wide heterogeneous reporting of the pandemic. Within this heterogenous coverage, 16% of COVID-19 news articles (or 4% of all English-language articles) can be classified as highly negatively polarized, citing issues such as death, fear, or crisis. CONCLUSIONS: The goal of COVID-19 public health communication is to increase understanding of distancing rules and to maximize the impact of governmental policy. The extent to which the quantity and quality of information from different communication channels (eg, social media, government pages, and news) influence public understanding of public health measures remains to be established. Here we conclude that a quarter of all reporting in 2020 covered COVID-19, which is indicative of information overload. In this capacity, our data and analysis form a quantitative basis for informing health communication strategies along traditional news media channels to minimize the risks of COVID-19 while vaccination is rolled out.","Krawczyk, Konrad; Chelkowski, Tadeusz; Laydon, Daniel J; Mishra, Swapnil; Xifara, Denise; Gibert, Benjamin; Flaxman, Seth; Mellan, Thomas; Schwämmle, Veit; Röttger, Richard; Hadsund, Johannes T; Bhatt, Samir",J Med Internet Res,,476

489588,COVID-19-Associated Coagulopathy,2021,"The development and authorization of COVID-19 vaccines has provided the clearest path forward to eliminate community spread hence end the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. However, the limited pace at which the vaccine can be administered motivates the question, to what extent must we continue to adhere to social intervention measures such as mask wearing and social distancing? To address this question, we develop a mathematical model of COVID-19 spread incorporating both vaccine dynamics and socio-epidemiological parameters. We use this model to study two important measures of disease control and eradication, the effective reproductive number $R_t$ and the peak intensive care unit (ICU) caseload, over three key parameters: social measure adherence, vaccination rate, and vaccination coverage. Our results suggest that, due to the slow pace of vaccine administration, social measures must be maintained by a large proportion of the population until a sufficient proportion of the population becomes vaccinated for the pandemic to be eradicated. By contrast, with reduced adherence to social measures, hospital ICU cases will greatly exceed capacity, resulting in increased avoidable loss of life. These findings highlight the complex interplays involved between vaccination and social protective measures, and indicate the practical importance of continuing with extent social measures while vaccines are scaled up to allow the development of the herd immunity needed to end or control SARS-CoV-2 sustainably.","Young, Glenn; Xiao, Pengcheng; Newcomb, Kenneth; Michael, Edwin",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.06120v1.pdf,476

Pregnant women and neonates are two vulnerable groups in COVID-19 infections because the immune system weakens during pregnancy. The present review study was conducted to investigate the rate of vertical transmission in infants born to women with COVID-19 infections and to describe the characteristics of the affected infants. We conducted a search of the various scientific databases using relevant keywords. All English-language studies involving neonates born to women who had COVID-19 infections were included. The main outcomes were rates of vertical transmission and the characteristics of the affected newborns. Out of 13 selected studies, 103 newborns were involved. The rate of vertical transmission was 5.4%. Of the five infected newborns, four were full-term and one was preterm. All were born by Cesarean section. The clinical symptoms were vomiting, fever, lethargy, shortness of breath, and cyanosis. In four newborns, a chest x-ray showed evidence of pneumonia. The most common laboratory finding was leukocytosis and elevated creatine kinase levels. One newborn needed mechanical ventilation. All newborns recovered and were discharged. The findings of this review study showed that the prognosis of newborns of infected mothers was satisfactory, and clinical symptoms of infected neonates did not differ from adults and were nonspecific. Due to the low amount of data regarding this field, further studies with higher sample sizes are required for more definitive conclusions.","Makvandi, Somayeh; Mahdavian, Mitra; Kazemi-Nia, Goli; Vahedian-Azimi, Amir; Karimi, Leila; Sahebkar, Amirhossein",Adv Exp Med Biol,,476

The clinical characteristics vary from asymptomatic to fatal. This study aims to examine the association between body mass index (BMI) levels and the severity of COVID-19. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: A cohort study included 147 adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 were categorized into 4 groups by BMI levels on admission: <18.5 (underweight), 18.5-22.9 (normal weight), 23.0-24.9 (overweight), and &#8805;25.0 kg/m2 (obese). Rates of pneumonia, severe pneumonia, acute kidney injury (AKI), and ICU stay during hospitalization across BMI group was determined. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the association between BMI and severe pneumonia. RESULTS: Of the totals, patients having a BMI <18.5, 18.5-22.9, 23.0-24.9, and &#8805;25.0 kg/m2 were 12.9%, 38.1%, 17.7%, and 31.3%, respectively. The rates of pneumonia and severe pneumonia tended to be higher in patients with higher BMI, whereas the rates of AKI and ICU stay were higher in patients with BMI <18.5 kg/m2 and &#8805; 25 kg/m2, when compared to patients with normal BMI. After controlling for age, sex, diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia in the logistic regression analysis, having a BMI &#8805;25.0 kg/m2 was associated with higher risk of severe pneumonia (OR 4.73; 95% CI, 1.50-14.94; p = 0.003) compared to having a BMI 18.5-22.9 kg/m2. During admission, elevated hemoglobin and alanine aminotransferase levels on day 7 and 14 of illness were associated with higher BMI levels. In contrast, rising of serum creatinine levels was observed in underweight patients on days 12 and 14 of illness. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity in patients with COVID-19 was associated with severe pneumonia and adverse outcomes such as AKI, transaminitis and ICU stay. Underweight patients should be closely monitored for AKI. Further studies in body composition are warranted to explore the links between adiposity and COVID-19 pathogenesis.","Jayanama, Kulapong; Srichatrapimuk, Sirawat; Thammavaranucupt, Kanin; Kirdlarp, Suppachok; Suppadungsuk, Supawadee; Wongsinin, Thananya; Nanthatanti, Nithita; Phusanti, Sithakom; Pitidhammabhorn, Dhanesh; Sungkanuparph, Somnuek",PLoS One,,476

Expanded tracing-testing efforts were touted as a key solution that would allow for a precision approach, thus preventing economies from having to shut down again. However, it is now clear that many regions of the U.S. were unable to mount robust enough testing-tracing programs to prevent major resurgences of disease.

Currently in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is unclear whether antenatal corticosteroids for infant benefit outweigh the potential harm to a pregnant woman with a COVID-19 infection.Objective: To determine at which gestational ages administering antenatal corticosteroids is the optimal management strategy for hospitalized women with preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM) who have a COVID-19 infection.Methods: We designed a decision-analytic model to assess the maternal and infant outcomes associated with antenatal corticosteroid administration for risk of preterm delivery following rupture of membranes in the setting of a COVID-19 infection. We used a theoretical cohort of 10,000 women at each gestational age between 24 and 32 weeks who were hospitalized with PPROM and found to be COVID-19 positive. Maternal outcomes included intensive care unit admission and death related to COVID-19 infection. The infant outcomes of interest included respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage, neurodevelopmental delay, and death, and were assessed along with maternal and infant quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to evaluate model assumptions.Results: In our theoretical cohort of 10,000 women with COVID-19 infection and preterm prelabor rupture of membrane between 24 and 32 weeks, corticosteroid administration resulted in 2,200 women admitted to the ICU and 110 maternal deaths at each gestational age. No antenatal corticosteroid use resulted in 1,500 ICU admissions and 75 maternal deaths at each gestational age. Antenatal corticosteroid administration also resulted in fewer cases of respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage, and infant death. Overall, we found that between 24 and 30 weeks of gestation, administering antenatal corticosteroids was the optimal management strategy as it resulted in higher combined QALYs than no corticosteroid use. For 31 and 32 weeks of gestation, antenatal corticosteroid administration resulted in lower combined QALYs. On sensitivity analyses, we found that with increasing gestational age, the probability which antenatal corticosteroids was the optimal management strategy decreased.Conclusion: Administration of antenatal corticosteroids was an effective management strategy compared to no corticosteroid administration at gestational ages less than 31 weeks. These results provide data for clinicians to utilize when counseling pregnant patients hospitalized with PPROM and have a COVID-19 infection.","Zhou, Clarice G; Packer, Claire H; Hersh, Alyssa R; Caughey, Aaron B",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,,476

491372,Consolidating malignant pleural and peritoneal services during the COVID-19 response,2020,"Ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) are mustelids of special relevance to laboratory studies of respiratory viruses and have been shown to be susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and onward transmission. Here, we report the results of a natural experiment where 29 ferrets in one home had prolonged, direct contact and constant environmental exposure to two humans with symptomatic disease, one of whom was confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2. We observed no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from humans to ferrets based on viral and antibody assays. To better understand this discrepancy in experimental and natural infection in ferrets, we compared SARS-CoV-2 sequences from natural and experimental mustelid infections and identified two surface glycoprotein Spike (S) mutations associated with mustelids. While we found evidence that angiotensin-converting enzyme II provides a weak host barrier, one mutation only seen in ferrets is located in the novel S1/S2 cleavage site and is computationally predicted to decrease furin cleavage efficiency. These data support the idea that host factors interacting with the novel S1/S2 cleavage site may be a barrier in ferret SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and that domestic ferrets are at low risk of natural infection from currently circulating SARS-CoV-2. We propose two mechanistically grounded hypotheses for mustelid host adaptation of SARS-CoV-2, with possible effects that require additional investigation.","Sawatzki, Kaitlin; Hill, Nichola J; Puryear, Wendy B; Foss, Alexa D; Stone, Jonathon J; Runstadler, Jonathan A",Proc.

This retrospective cohort study included COVID-19 patients with oxygen saturation (SatO2 ) in room air <92% admitted between March 3 and April 30, 2020. Following the interim protocol, patients could receive dexamethasone or methylprednisolone, and were classified according to oxygen requirements. The primary endpoint was admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) or mortality. Kaplan-Meier and Cox hazards analyses were used. Of the 115 patients included, 38 received corticosteroids. Among requiring high-flow, noninvasive ventilation (NIV) or fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2 ) > 0.40, the hazard ratio (HR) for death or ICU admission, between the corticosteroids and non-corticosteroids group, was 0.07 (95% CI 0.01-0.4), p = .002, and for patients requiring low-flow oxygen, the HR was 0.70 (95% CI 0.13-3.8), p = .68. Significant differences were also observed when all patients were analyzed together. A significant reduction in mortality and ICU admission frequency was observed among patients requiring high-flow oxygen or NIV, but not among those requiring low-flow oxygen. Better targeting of COVID-19 patients is needed for the beneficial use of corticosteroids.","Tortajada, Cecilia; Colomer, Enrique; Andreu-Ballester, Juan C; Esparcia, Ana; Oltra, Carmina; Flores, Juan",J Med Virol,,476

492191,The impact of the coronavirus disease of 2019 on research,2020,"BACKGROUND: During disease outbreaks, nurses express concerns regarding the organizational and social support required to manage role conflicts. OBJECTIVES: The study examined concerns, threats, and attitudes relating to care provision during the COVID-19 outbreak among nurses in Israel. DESIGN: A 53-item questionnaire was designed for this research, including four open-ended questions. The article used a qualitative research to analyze the responses to the open-ended questions and their association with responses to the close-ended ones. PARTICIPANTS AND RESEARCH CONTEXT: In all, 231 registered nurses and fourth-year nursing students throughout the whole country. The questionnaire was delivered in nursing Facebook and WhatsApp groups and through snowball sampling. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: The research was pre-approved by the Ethics Committee at the researchers' university. RESULTS: Nurses mostly referred to personal risk, followed by dilemmas regarding care provision. On average, 38.6% of quotations stated that during the pandemic, nurses are not asked to perform unfair duties. Nurses discussed activities and requirements that impact their personal and familial safety, their relationship with employer, organization or the state, and their duty to providing care. Other than fear of contraction, respondents' most frequent themes of concerns were related to work condition and patients' interests, inter-collegiate relationships, and uncertainty and worries about the future. Respondents' ethical dilemmas mostly referred to clinical questions, providing care without adequate equipment or managerial support, and in conditions of uncertainty and increased risk. DISCUSSION: Nurses raise important issues concerning their relationships with employers and family members, and significant insights regarding the pandemic and their revised responsibilities and definition of work. They raise serious concerns regarding their rights at work and their standing for them. CONCLUSIONS: Health managers should find ways to enhance the ethical climate and institutional support to enable a better work-life balance in times of pandemic and support nurses' working needs and labor rights.","Sperling, Daniel",Nurs Ethics,,476

We aimed to analyze the effect of vitamin D sufficiency on the clinical outcomes of patients infected with COVID-19. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study we analyzed the vitamin D levels of COVID-19 patients who were admitted to Razi Hospital (an infectious disease referral center in Mazandaran province in northern Iran) from February to March 2020. Overall, a cutoff point of 30 ng/mL was used for the definition of vitamin D sufficiency. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-three patients were analyzed in this study who had laboratory documentation of a 25(OH) D level at the time of hospitalization. The vitamin D levels of the patients were 27.19 ± 20.17 ng/mL. In total, 62.7% (n = 96) of the patients had a 25(OH) D level of less than 30 ng/mL and 37.25% (n = 57) had a 25(OH) D level of more than 30 ng/mL. In total, 49% (n = 75) of the patients suffered from at least one underlying disease. The univariate and multivariable regression showed that vitamin D sufficiency was not associated with a statistically significant lower risk of adverse clinical outcomes of COVID-19 such as duration of hospitalization and severity of infection (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Sufficient vitamin D levels were not found to be protective against adverse clinical outcomes in patients infected with COVID-19. Chronic disorders in COVID-19 patients were found to have greater relevance than vitamin D levels in determining the adverse outcomes of the infection. Further studies are needed to determine the role of vitamin D level in predicting the outcomes of COVID-19 infection.","Davoudi, Alireza; Najafi, Narges; Aarabi, Mohsen; Tayebi, Atefeh; Nikaeen, Roja; Izadyar, Hamideh; Salar, Zahra; Delavarian, Leila; Vaseghi, Narges; Daftarian, Zahra; Ahangarkani, Fatemeh",BMC Infect Dis,,476

493238,Contractors balance increased demand during COVID-19,2020,"On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) as a pandemic. Until an effective treatment or a vaccine is developed, the current recommendations are to contain the disease, and control its transmission. It is now clear that the primary mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is aerosol/droplet spread, and by contacting virus-contaminated surfaces acting as fomites (inanimate vectors). Furthermore, recent data indicate that the live virus particles are present in saliva, and, more alarmingly, asymptomatic individuals may transmit the infection. By virtue of the nature of the practice of dentistry where intrinsically, a high volume of aerosols is produced, as well as the close proximity of dentists and patients during treatment, dentists and allied health staff are considered the highest risk health professional group for acquiring SARS-CoV-2 during patient management. Therefore, several organizations and specialty associations have proposed guidelines and recommendations for limiting the transmission of SARS-COV-2 from carriers to dentists and vice versa. This paper aims to provide a review of these guidelines, and concludes with a brief look at how the practice of dentistry may be impacted by COVID-19, in the post-pandemic era.","Jamal, Mohamed; Shah, Maanas; Almarzooqi, Sameeha Husain; Aber, Hend; Khawaja, Summayah; El Abed, Rashid; Alkhatib, Zuhair; Samaranayake, Lakshman Perera",Oral dis,,476

We aimed to study the characteristics of thyroid hormone levels in patients with COVID-19 and to explore whether thyroid hormone predicts all-cause mortality of severely or critically ill patients. METHODS: The clinical data of 100 patients with COVID-19, who were admitted to Wuhan Tongji Hospital from February 8 to March 8, 2020, were analyzed in this retrospective study. The patients were followed up for 6-41 days. Patients were grouped into non-severe illness and severe or critical illness, which included survivors and non-survivors. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for all-cause mortality in association with continuous and the lower two quartiles of thyroid hormone concentrations in severely or critically ill patients. RESULTS: The means of free T3 (FT3) were 4.40, 3.73 and 2.76 pmol/L in non-severely ill patients, survivors and non-survivors, respectively. The lower (versus upper) two quartiles of FT3 was associated with all-cause mortality HR (95% CI) of 9.23 (2.01, 42.28). The HR (95% CI) for all-cause mortality in association with continuous FT3 concentration was 0.41 (0.21, 0.81). In the multivariate-adjusted models, free T4 (FT4), TSH and FT3/FT4 were not significantly related to all-cause mortality. Patients with FT3 less than 3.10 pmol/L had increased all-cause mortality. CONCLUSION: FT3 concentration was significantly lower in patients with severe COVID-19 than in non-severely ill patients. Reduced FT3 independently predicted all-cause mortality of patients with severe COVID-19.","Gao, W; Guo, W; Guo, Y; Shi, M; Dong, G; Wang, G; Ge, Q; Zhu, J; Zhou, X",J. endocrinol. invest,,476

Thirty adult patients with laboratory-confirmed mild to moderate forms of COVID-19 underwent a quantitative olfactory test performed with the Sniffin' Sticks test (SST; Burghardt, Wedel, Germany), considering olfactory threshold (T), odor discrimination (D), and odor identification (I). Results were presented as a composite TDI score (range 1-48) that used to define functional anosmia (TDI &#8804; 16.5), hyposmia (16.5 < TDI < 30.5), or functionally normal ability to smell (TDI &#8805; 30.5). Patients also self-evaluated their olfactory function by rating their ability to smell on a visual analogue scale (Visual Analog Scale rating) and answering a validated Italian questionnaire (Hyposmia Rating Scale). Patients were tested during hospitalization and about 2 months after symptoms onset. During the hospitalization, the overall TDI score indicated that our cohort had impairments in their olfactory ability (10% was diagnosed with anosmia and more than 50% were hyposmic). Almost all patients showed a significant improvement at around 1 month following the first test and for all the parts of the SST except for odor identification. None of the subjects at 1 month was still diagnosed with anosmia. We also quantified the improvement in the TDI score based on initial diagnosis. Anosmic subjects showed a greater improvement than hyposmic and normosmic subjects. In conclusion, within a month time window and 2 months after symptoms' onset, in our cohort of patients we observed a substantial improvement in the olfactory abilities.","Iannuzzi, Lucia; Salzo, Anna Eugenia; Angarano, Gioacchino; Palmieri, Vincenzo Ostilio; Portincasa, Piero; Saracino, Annalisa; Gelardi, Matteo; Dibattista, Michele; Quaranta, Nicola",Chem Senses,,476

Although composite likelihood construction is a crucial aspect influencing both computing and statistical properties of the resulting estimator, currently there does not seem to exist a universal rule to combine low-dimensional likelihood objects that is statistically justified and fast in execution. This paper develops a methodology to select and combine the most informative low-dimensional likelihoods from a large set of candidates while carrying out parameter estimation. The new procedure minimizes the distance between composite likelihood and full likelihood scores subject to a constraint representing the afforded computing cost. The selected composite likelihood is sparse in the sense that it contains a relatively small number of informative sub-likelihoods while the noisy terms are dropped. The resulting estimator is found to have asymptotic variance close to that of the minimum-variance estimator constructed using all the low-dimensional likelihoods.","Huang, Zhendong; Ferrari, Davide",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.05219v1.pdf,476

As part of the amendment to the Infection Protection Act, elective medical interventions were restricted, leading to a change in patient care. However, the consequences of the lockdown on the treatment of rhythmological patients in Germany remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to analyze the reduction in rhythmological interventions and the patient care situation using a nationwide survey during the first lockdown period. METHODS: A survey was sent to all electrophysiological centers certified by the German Society of Cardiology. Here, the treatment volume of tachycardia and bradycardia and their invasive therapy were surveyed before and during the lockdown period. Furthermore, the number of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) treated at these centers and the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias was also recorded. RESULTS: Participating centers performed a total of 24,648 ablation procedures/year and represent approximately 34% (24,648/72,548) of the estimated German ablation treatments. The majority of these centers (33/40; 82.5%) were so-called primary COVID-19 hospitals (level-1). Overall, the number of ablations and pacemaker implantations were reduced by 41% and 18% respectively. Due to postponed ablation procedures and pacemaker implantations, 22/40 (55%) centers reported a worsening of clinical symptoms or early re-hospitalization of their patients. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate a significant decline in elective rhythmological procedures during the lockdown, as required by the German Federal Government. At the same time, however, more than half of the participating centers reported an increase in patient re-hospitalizations due to postponed procedures.","Mathew, Shibu; Fraebel, Christian; Johnson, Victoria; Abdelgwad, Saboukh; Schneider, Nikita; Müller, Patrick; Chasan, Ritvan; Hamm, Christian; Schmitt, Joern",Herzschrittmacherther. elektrophysiol,,476

Shifting ideologies in the COVID-19 bailout conditionality debate",2020,"PURPOSE: The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected healthcare systems across the nation. The purpose of this study is to gauge the early effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on head and neck oncology and reconstructive surgery (HNORS) practice and evaluate their practice patterns especially ones that might be impacted by COVID-19 and compare them to the current literature. METHODS: This study is a cross-sectional study that surveyed fellowship-trained oral and maxillofacial surgeons in HNORS. This cohort of surgeons was contacted via a generated email list of surgeons enrolled in the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons pathology special interest group. An electronic survey contained 16 questions to assess the COVID-19 effect on HNORS practice and capture their practice patterns from mid-March to mid-April 2020. Statistical analysis was performed to analyze counts, percentages, and response rates. RESULTS: We had a 60% response rate (39 of 64); 72% of our responders worked at academic institutions, 18% marked themselves as hybrid academic/private practice, and only 10% were considered hospital-based surgeons. Only 8% of the survey respondents were requested to pause head and neck cancer surgery, whereas 24% were requested to pause free flap surgery during the pandemic. Fifty-five percent agreed that the head and neck and reconstructive surgery should be conducted during a pandemic. Finally, 45% thought that two weeks was a reasonable delay for head and neck cancer cases, whereas 29% thought they should not be delayed for any amount of time. Regarding practice patterns, microvascular reconstruction was the favored method (100%). Respondents generally admitted patients to an intensive care unit postoperatively (92%) and were kept on a ventilator (53%). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic had a small impact on the surgical treatment of patients with head and neck oncology. Most HNORS surgeons are practicing in accordance with recently published literature.","Zaid, Waleed; Schlieve, Thomas",J Oral Maxillofac Surg,,476

494715,A Study on the Job Retention Intention of Nurses Based on Social Support in the COVID-19 Situation,2020,"Handwashing using soap or hand sanitizer is one of the health protocols that must be implemented by society to prevent the spreading of SARS-Cov-2 virus which can cause pneumonia, acute respiratory syndrome and death. The implementation of health protocols during the COVID-19 pandemic caused the habit of handwashing increase. Hence, it can lead to cause irritant contact dermatitis and dry hand skin due to frequent contact with soap or hand sanitizers. Method: This study is an observational study with the sample from the villager of Banyumas regency. The data collection was taken by cluster random sampling and accidental sampling. Results: Considering the health protocol, most of the villager used to wash their hands regularly and 3 respondents (3.00%) of them did not. 100 respondents took the data and 19 respondents (19.00%) have irritant contact dermatitis and the rest did not. Furthermore, for skin hydration levels with dehydration category (0% - 29%) are 50 respondents (50.00%), normal category (30% - 50%) are 38 respondents (38.00%) and hydration category (51% - 100 %) are 12 respondents (12.00%). Chi-Square analysis showed that there was no significant relationship between handwashing habit and the incidence of irritant contact dermatitis with the value of “P” is 0.394&gt; 0.05 and there was a significant relationship between hand washing habits and skin hydration levels with the value of “P” is 0.010 &lt;0, 05. Conclusion: Handwashing habits have a significant relationship to skin hydration levels.","Sutiawati, Sustiawati; Hapsari, Indri; Putri, Irsalina Nurul; en,",Jurnal Farmasi Sains Dan Praktis,,476

To investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic prevention and control actions on the chemical composition, size distribution, and mixing state of individual particles, real-time individual particles in the urban atmosphere of the Northern China were analyzed using single particle aerosol mass spectrometry (SPAMS) during January 16 to February 4, 2020. The results showed that the concentrations of PM2.5, NOx, and CO were lower during DP (during the pandemic) than those during BP (before the pandemic), while O3concentration increased by about 40.9% during DP due to a lower concentration of NO2restrainting the decomposition of O3via the reation of NO with O3. The number count of carbonaceous particles during DP decreased by 20.2% compared to that during BP due to the sharp reduction of factory production and vehicular transportation during DP. Dust particles during DP exhibited weaker23Na+,56Fe+, and79PO3–signals than those during BP, suggesting that dust particles during DP were mostly derived from mineral dust rather than industrial sources. The total particles during DP peaked at a larger size than those during BP, due to the higher fraction of secondary inorganic ions through the enhanced heterogeneous aqueous oxidation. The unscaled size distribution of total particles peaked at 0.50 µm during BP and at 0.66–0.70 µm during DP, suggesting that particles remained for a long time in the atmosphere and went through a strong aging process during DP. The single particles during DP were more aged than those during BP, owing to the stronger atmospheric oxidizing capacity during DP.","Li, Zheng; Meng, Jingjing; Zhou, Ling; Zhou, Ruiwen; Fu, Mengxuan; Wang, Yachen; Yi, Yanan; Song, Aijing; Guo, Qingchun; Hou, Zhanfang; Yan, Li",Aerosol Air Qual.

This work has aimed to study the prevalence of APS-related antigens, antibodies, and immune complexes in patients with COVID-19 and their association with clinical events. METHODS: A prospective study was conducted on 474 adults with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection hospitalized in two Spanish university hospitals. Patients were evaluated for classic and extra-criteria antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLs), immunoglobulin G (IgG)/immunoglobulin M (IgM) anticardiolipin, IgG/IgM/immunoglobulin A (IgA) anti-ß2-glicoprotein-I (aß2GPI), IgG/IgM antiphosphatidylserine/prothrombin (aPS/PT), the immune complex of IgA aß2GPI (IgA-aß2GPI), bounded to ß2-glicoprotein-1 (ß2GPI) and ß2GPI levels soon after COVID-19 diagnosis and were followed-up until medical discharge or death. RESULTS: Prevalence of aPLs in patients with COVID-19 was as follows: classic aPLs, 5.8%; aPS/PT, 4.6%; IgA-aß2GPI, 15%; and any aPL, 21%. When patients were compared with individuals of a control group of a similar age, the only significant difference found was the higher prevalence of IgA-aß2GPI (odds ratio: 2.31; 95% confidence interval: 1.16-4.09). No significant differences were observed in survival, thrombosis, or ventilatory failure in aPL-positive versus aPL-negative patients. ß2GPI median levels were much lower in patients with COVID-19 (15.9 mg/l) than in blood donors (168.8 mg/l; P < 0.001). Only 3.5% of patients with COVID-19 had normal levels of ß2GPI (>85 mg/l). Low levels of ß2GPI were significantly associated with ventilatory failure (P = 0.026). CONCLUSION: ß2GPI levels were much lower in patients with COVID-19 than in healthy people. Low ß2GPI-levels were associated with ventilatory failure. No differences were observed in the COVID-19 evolution between aPL-positive and aPL-negative patients. Functional ß2GPI deficiency could trigger a clinical process similar to that seen in APS but in the absence of aPLs.","Serrano, Manuel; Espinosa, Gerard; Lalueza, Antonio; Bravo-Gallego, Luz Yadira; Diaz-Simón, Raquel; Garcinuño, Sara; Gil-Etayo, Javier; Moises, Jorge; Naranjo, Laura; Prieto-González, Sergio; Ruiz-Ortiz, Estibaliz; Sánchez, Beatriz; Moreno-Castaño, Ana Belen; Díaz-Pedroche, Carmen; Viñas-Gomis, Odette; Cervera, Ricard; Serrano, Antonio",,,476

496031,"Waxing power, waning pollution: The effect of COVID-19 on Russian environmental policymaking",2021,"Reinforcement learning is a powerful framework for robots to acquire skills from experience, but often requires a substantial amount of online data collection. As a result, it is difficult to collect sufficiently diverse experiences that are needed for robots to generalize broadly. Videos of humans, on the other hand, are a readily available source of broad and interesting experiences. In this paper, we consider the question: can we perform reinforcement learning directly on experience collected by humans? This problem is particularly difficult, as such videos are not annotated with actions and exhibit substantial visual domain shift relative to the robot's embodiment. To address these challenges, we propose a framework for reinforcement learning with videos (RLV). RLV learns a policy and value function using experience collected by humans in combination with data collected by robots. In our experiments, we find that RLV is able to leverage such videos to learn challenging vision-based skills with less than half as many samples as RL methods that learn from scratch.","Schmeckpeper, Karl; Rybkin, Oleh; Daniilidis, Kostas; Levine, Sergey; Finn, Chelsea",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.06507v1.pdf,476

Specifically, male patients are at a higher death risk than female patients, and the older population is significantly more affected than young individuals. Whether this difference is a consequence of a pre-existing differential response to the virus, has not been studied in detail. We created DeCovid, an R shiny app that combines gene expression (GE) data of different human tissue from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project along with the COVID-19 Disease Map and COVID-19 related pathways gene collections to explore basal GE differences across healthy demographic groups. We used this app to study differential gene expression of COVID-19 associated genes in different age and sex groups. We identified that healthy women show higher expression-levels of interferon genes. Conversely, healthy men exhibit higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Additionally, young people present a stronger complement system and maintain a high level of matrix metalloproteases than older adults. Our data suggest the existence of different basal immunophenotypes amongst different demographic groups, which are relevant to COVID-19 progression and may contribute to explaining sex and age biases in disease severity. The DeCovid app is an effective and easy to use tool for exploring the GE levels relevant to COVID-19 across demographic groups and tissues.","Liu, Tianyuan; Balzano-Nogueira, Leandro; Lleo, Ana; Conesa, Ana",,,476

496655,The chilly climate may increase the chance of infecting COVID-19,2021,"As the national reference laboratory for febrile illness in Madagascar, we processed samples from the first epidemic wave of COVID-19, between March and September 2020. We fit generalized additive models to cycle threshold (Ct) value data from our RT-qPCR platform, demonstrating a peak in high viral load, low-Ct value infections temporally coincident with peak epidemic growth rates estimated in real time from publicly-reported incidence data and retrospectively from our own laboratory testing data across three administrative regions. We additionally demonstrate a statistically significant effect of duration of time since infection onset on Ct value, suggesting that Ct value can be used as a biomarker of the stage at which an individual is sampled in the course of an infection trajectory. As an extension, the population-level Ct distribution at a given timepoint can be used to estimate population-level epidemiological dynamics. We illustrate this concept by adopting a recently-developed, nested modeling approach, embedding a within-host viral kinetics model within a population-level Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) framework, to mechanistically estimate epidemic growth rates from cross-sectional Ct distributions across three regions in Madagascar. We find that Ct-derived epidemic growth estimates slightly precede those derived from incidence data across the first epidemic wave, suggesting delays in surveillance and case reporting. Our findings indicate that public reporting of Ct values could offer an important resource for epidemiological inference in low surveillance settings, enabling forecasts of impending incidence peaks in regions with limited case reporting.","Andriamandimby, Soa Fy; Brook, Cara E.; Razanajatovo, Norosoa H; Rakotondramanga, Jean-Marius; Rasambainarivo, Fidisoa; Raharimanga, Vaomalala; Razanajatovo, Iony M.; Mangahasimbola, Reziky; Razafindratsimandresy, Richter L; Randrianarisoa, Santatra; Bernardson, Barivola; Rabarison, Joelinotahina H; Randrianarisoa, Mirella; Nasolo, Frederick S; Rabetombosoa, Roger M; Randremanana, Rindra V; Heraud, Jean-Michel; Dussart, Philippe G",,,476

METHODS: This case-control study included newborns diagnosed with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China from January 2020 to July 2020. All included newborns had complete neurological evaluations and head magnetic resonance imaging. We normalized the extracted T2-weighted imaging data to a standard neonate template space, and segmented them into gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid. The comparison of gray matter volume was conducted between the two groups. RESULTS: A total of five neonates with COVID-19 were included in this study. The median reflex scores were 2 points lower in the infected group than in the control group (P = 0.0094), and the median orientation and behavior scores were 2.5 points lower in the infected group than in the control group (P = 0.0008). There were also significant differences between the two groups in the total scale score (P = 0.0426). The caudate nucleus, parahippocampal gyrus, and thalamus had the strongest correlations with the Hammersmith neonatal neurologic examination (HNNE) score, and the absolute correlation coefficients between the gray matter volumes and each part of the HNNE score were all almost greater than 0.5. CONCLUSIONS: We first compared the neurological performance of neonates with and without COVID-19 by quantitative neuroimaging and neurological examination methods. Considering the limited numbers of patients, more studies focusing on the structural or functional aspects of the virus in the central nervous system in different age groups will be carried out in the future.","Yan, Kai; Xiao, Fei-Fan; Jiang, Yu-Wei; Xiao, Tian-Tian; Zhang, Da-Jiang; Yuan, Wen-Hao; Shao, Jian-Bo; Cheng, Guo-Qiang; Zeng, Ling-Kong",World J Pediatr,,476

497526,Critical adjustments in a department of orthopaedics through the COVID-19 pandemic. (Special Issue: COVID-19 and orthopaedics.),2020,"A previously developed mechanistic model of COVID-19 transmission has been adapted and applied here to study the evolution of the disease and the effect of intervention measures in some European countries and territories where the disease has had a major impact. A clear impact of the major intervention measures on the reproduction number (Rt) has been found in all studied countries and territories, as already suggested by the drop in the number of deaths over time. Interestingly, the impact of such major intervention measures seems to be the same in most of these countries. The model has also provided realistic estimates of the total number of infections, active cases and future outcomes. While the predictive capabilities of the model are much more uncertain before the peak of the outbreak, we could still reliably predict the evolution of the disease after a major intervention by assuming the subsequent reproduction number from the current study. A greater challenge is to foresee the long-term impact of softer intervention measures, but this model can estimate the outcome of different scenarios and help to plan changes for the implementation of control measures in a given country or region.","Fernández-Recio, Juan",J.

497650,Assessing the preparedness of hospitals facing disasters using the rough set theory: guidelines for more preparedness to cope with the COVID-19,2021,"We assessed the impact of chest CT body composition parameters on outcomes and disease severity at hospital presentation of COVID-19 patients, focusing also on the possible mediation of body composition in the relationship between age and death in these patients. Chest CT scans performed at hospital presentation by consecutive COVID-19 patients (02/27/2020-03/13/2020) were retrospectively reviewed to obtain pectoralis muscle density and total, visceral, and intermuscular adipose tissue areas (TAT, VAT, IMAT) at the level of T7-T8 vertebrae. Primary outcomes were: hospitalization, mechanical ventilation (MV) and/or death, death alone. Secondary outcomes were: C-reactive protein (CRP), oxygen saturation (SO2), CT disease extension at hospital presentation. The mediation of body composition in the effect of age on death was explored. Of the 318 patients included in the study (median age 65.7 years, females 37.7%), 205 (64.5%) were hospitalized, 68 (21.4%) needed MV, and 58 (18.2%) died. Increased muscle density was a protective factor while increased TAT, VAT, and IMAT were risk factors for hospitalization and MV/death. All these parameters except TAT had borderline effects on death alone. All parameters were associated with SO2 and extension of lung parenchymal involvement at CT; VAT was associated with CRP. Approximately 3% of the effect of age on death was mediated by decreased muscle density. In conclusion, low muscle quality and ectopic fat accumulation were associated with COVID-19 outcomes, VAT was associated with baseline inflammation. Low muscle quality partly mediated the effect of age on mortality.","Besutti, Giulia; Pellegrini, Massimo; Ottone, Marta; Cantini, Michele; Milic, Jovana; Bonelli, Efrem; Dolci, Giovanni; Cassone, Giulia; Ligabue, Guido; Spaggiari, Lucia; Pattacini, Pierpaolo; Fasano, Tommaso; Canovi, Simone; Massari, Marco; Salvarani, Carlo; Guaraldi, Giovanni; Rossi, Paolo Giorgi",PLoS One,,476

Social media outlets have reportedly made efforts to limit false information yet untruths related to COVID-19 persist online. The purpose of this study was to describe the content on COVID-19 vaccination on TikTok, an emerging social media platform. One-hundred trending videos were identified from the hashtag #covidvaccine and were coded for content. Collectively, these videos garnered over 35 million views. The coding category with the highest number of videos was ""Discouraged a Vaccine"" (n = 38), followed by ""Encouraged a Vaccine"" (n = 36). While only 36 videos encouraged a vaccine, these videos garnered over 50% of the total cumulative views and just under 50% of the total likes; the 38 videos that discouraged a vaccine garnered 39.6% of the total cumulative views, 44.3% of likes, and 47.4% of comments. Of the 38 videos discouraging the vaccine, 25 (65.79%) showed a parody of an adverse reaction and, collectively, received 71.07% of the total views among videos in this category. Twenty-two of these 38 videos (57.89%) falsely conveyed that a vaccine was available, as they were not at the time of the study. Anti-vaccination messaging may undermine efforts to ensure widespread uptake of the various COVID-19 vaccines, particularly for young people who are more likely than other age cohorts to use TikTok.","Basch, Corey H; Meleo-Erwin, Zoe; Fera, Joseph; Jaime, Christie; Basch, Charles E",Hum Vaccin Immunother,,476

The complex mosaic of changes in brain morphology and functional organization that have shaped the mammalian cortex during evolution, complicates attempts to chart cortical differences across species. It limits our ability to fully appreciate how evolution has shaped our brain, especially in systems associated with unique human cognitive capabilities that lack anatomical homologues in other species. Here, we develop a function-based method for cross-species alignment that enables the quantification of homologous regions between humans and rhesus macaques, even when their location is decoupled from anatomical landmarks. Critically, we find cross-species similarity in functional organization reflects a gradient of evolutionary change that decreases from unimodal systems and culminates with the most pronounced changes in posterior regions of the default mode network (angular gyrus, posterior cingulate and middle temporal cortices). Our findings suggest that the establishment of the default mode network, as the apex of a cognitive hierarchy, has changed in a complex manner during human evolution - even within subnetworks.","Xu, Ting; Nenning, Karl-Heinz; Schwartz, Ernst; Hong, Seok-Jun; Vogelstein, Joshua T; Goulas, Alexandros; Fair, Damien A; Schroeder, Charles E; Margulies, Daniel S; Smallwood, Jonny; Milham, Michael P; Langs, Georg",Neuroimage,,476

It is caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and well known as droplet-borne disease. The droplets containing coronavirus are spread through the air within a meter and deposited on the mucous membranes of suscpetible person. The aim of this study was to produce a general framework model of corona virus disease with the application of large-scale social restriction, self-quarantine and immune system improvement as control strategies to reduce the spread of the disease. This study was conducted in Surabaya, Indonesia with a total of 299 positive patients infected with covid-19 until the fourth week of April, 2020. The transmission routes of the disease had been constructed based on the real problem. Therefore, human population have been divided into some sub-population based on the characteritics of disease symptoms. The spread of covid-19 have been formulated mathematically by using compartment model. Stability analysis had been done for a free disease equilbrium and an endemic equilibrium. Moreover, numerical simulation were also provided to quantify the disease dynamics.","Artiono, Rudianto Yunianti Dwi Nur Prawoto Budi Priyo Yuliani Puji Astuti",Journal of Physics: Conference Series,,476

The industries abide to environmental norms and regulations essential to control air pollution from stationary sources. Among wind, vehicle movement and industry, the latter is a major contributor to air pollution that necessitates regular monitoring. Through this study, we have attempted to analyse the contribution of stationary sources of industries to the air pollution in Delhi. The comparative study before and after nationwide lockdown due to Covid19 pandemic provides an insight into the role of organised and unorganised industry in air pollution emission. This paper portrays the decrease in air pollutants because of temporary shutdown of unorganised industry with stack emissions. However, the organised industries like power generating sector remained functional and continued to add air pollutants. This study on air pollution during lockdown contemplates an urgency to formulate provisions that will force the industries to adhere to air emission monitoring and standards. Due to restrictions of industry, the challenges persist in the detail study of combustion and plume discharge. The future scope of this study is to quantify the contribution of plume discharges from organised and unorganised industries and conduct detailed analysis of stationary sources emissions due to combustion. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Ghosh, D.; Kumari, M.","3rd International Conference on Trends and Recent Advancement in Civil Engineering, TRACE 2020",,476

500493,The Unanticipated Effects of COVID-19,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly contagious virus that can transmit through respiratory droplets, aerosols, or contacts. Frequent touching of contaminated surfaces in public areas is therefore a potential route of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The inanimate surfaces have often been described as a source of nosocomial infections. However, summaries on the transmissibility of coronaviruses from contaminated surfaces to induce the coronavirus disease 2019 are rare at present. This review aims to summarize data on the persistence of different coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces. The literature was systematically searched on Medline without language restrictions. All reports with experimental evidence on the duration persistence of coronaviruses on any type of surface were included. Most viruses from the respiratory tract, such as coronaviruses, influenza, SARS-CoV, or rhinovirus, can persist on surfaces for a few days. Persistence time on inanimate surfaces varied from minutes to up to one month, depending on the environmental conditions. SARSCoV-2 can be sustained in air in closed unventilated buses for at least 30 min without losing infectivity. The most common coronaviruses may well survive or persist on surfaces for up to one month. Viruses in respiratory or fecal specimens can maintain infectivity for quite a long time at room temperature. Absorbent materials like cotton are safer than unabsorbent materials for protection from virus infection. The risk of transmission via touching contaminated paper is low. Preventive strategies such as washing hands and wearing masks are critical to the control of coronavirus disease 2019.","Ren, Shi-Yan; Wang, Wen-Biao; Hao, Ya-Guang; Zhang, Hao-Ran; Wang, Zhi-Chao; Chen, Ye-Lin; Gao, Rong-Ding",World J.

500517,COVID‑19 at the Community Level: What are the Countermeasures?,2020,"Coronaviruses first garnered widespread attention in 2002 when the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged from bats in China and rapidly spread in human populations. Since then, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged and still actively infects humans. The recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and the resulting disease (coronavirus disease 2019, COVID19) have rapidly and catastrophically spread and highlighted significant limitations to our ability to control and treat infection. Thus, a basic understanding of entry and replication mechanisms of coronaviruses is necessary to rationally evaluate potential antivirals. Here, we show that polyamines, small metabolites synthesized in human cells, facilitate coronavirus replication and the depletion of polyamines with FDA-approved molecules significantly reduces coronavirus replication. We find that diverse coronaviruses, including endemic and epidemic coronaviruses, exhibit reduced attachment and entry into polyamine-depleted cells. We further demonstrate that several molecules targeting the polyamine biosynthetic pathway are antiviral in vitro. In sum, our data suggest that polyamines are critical to coronavirus replication and represent a highly promising drug target in the current and any future coronavirus outbreaks.","Firpo, Mason R; Mastrodomenico, Vincent; Hawkins, Grant M; Prot, Matthieu; Levillayer, Laura; Gallagher, Tom; Simon-Loriere, Etienne; Mounce, Bryan C",ACS infect. dis,,476

The use of phylogenetic methods to analyse pathogen genetic sequence data to understand disease dynamics is called 'molecular' or 'genomic' epidemiology. Many research groups in this subfield utilise open science practices, which can involve the circulation of early unreviewed findings on publicly-accessible venues online. From March to May 2020, media outlets covered early SARS-CoV-2 genomic studies that claimed to have discovered types of SARS-CoV-2 that had mutated to be more transmissible. We use methods from Science and Technology Studies (STS) to examine three cumulative cases in which unripe facts about SARS-CoV-2 genomics moved out of scientific publics and into mainstream news. The three cases are: (1) 'A More ""Aggressive"" Strain of SARS-CoV-2?', (2) 'Eight SARS-CoV-2 Strains?', and (3) 'A ""More Contagious,"" ""Mutant"" Strain?' In each case, findings were called into question and reporters' framing was overly sensational.

Hospital staff from the isolation wards were trained in the safety and proper use of the hazardous materials suit and the proper managing of the biohazard materials. We were not expecting the situation, so we started to create more restrictions than facilities for mothers giving birth. In the context of infection risk for the fetus, scientists still search for vertical transmission evidence, but avail-able data are ambiguous, and more research is needed. Concerning the infant safety and to minimalize the infection risk for medical teams, the first Polish guidelines published by the national consultants in obstetrics, midwifery, neonatology, and perinatology regarding the safest formula of birth were as the following: in the case of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, the cesarean section for epidemic indications should be considered, except in an advanced or rapid labor. In the lately updated consensus (14th May), it was written that because the risk of vertical and intranatal SARS-CoV-2 transmission seemed to be low, the SARS-CoV-2 infection was not the main indication to perform cesarean section for any longer. Regardless of the birth formula, the newborns are separated from their mothers immediately after the labor in Polish obstetrician hospitals. The Polish Lactation Study Centre, consociating International Breastfeeding Certified Lactation Consultant, recommends feeding the newborn with its own mother's milk, even if she is infected with SARS-CoV-2 and isolated from her infant.","Wszolek, Katarzyna M; Chmaj-Wierzchowska, Karolina; Wilczak, Maciej",Ginekol. pol,,476

Nevertheless prolonged IL-6 exposition activates apoptosis. According to recent studies increased levels of IL-6 increase cardiovascular disease risks. The aim of the study was to explore IL-6 basic levels in chronic congestive heart failure patients, as in risk group in COVID-19, and various factors (demographic or clinical) in various groups of IL-6 basic levels. We used consecutive sampling approach to recruit 96 congestive heart failure patients and 34 persons without the condition as controls. Hematologic, biochemical and immunologic parameters were measured using conventional methods. We used descriptive statistics for demographic parameters. We compared mean values of hematologic and biochemical parameters in cases and controls using independent sample t test and explored differences within the congestive heart failure group (further separated in 3 groups according to IL-6 levels) using one way ANOVA test, with further post-hoc analysis. Levels of IL-6 are statistically significantly higher in CHF patients; groups differ in co-morbidity, also abdominal obesity is more prevalent in diseased group. Difference between groups is significant in a number of pro-inflammation, coagulation, hematology parameters. It is also important to note that the CHF group showed a number of differences in sub-groups according to IL-6 levels, risks of CHF and comorbidity deterioration risks therefore are suggested to be different.","Gulatava, N; Tabagari, N; Talakvadze, T; Nadareishvili, I; Tabagari, S",Georgian Med News,,476

502413,Surge Response: How the Panhandle Handled One of the State's Biggest COVID-19 Outbreaks,2020,"BACKGROUND: All prevention efforts currently being implemented for COVID-19 are aimed at reducing the burden on strained health systems and human resources. There has been little research conducted to understand how SARS-CoV-2 has affected health care systems and professionals in terms of their work. Finding effective ways to share the knowledge and insight between countries, including lessons learned, is paramount to the international containment and management of the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this project is to compare the pandemic response to COVID-19 in Brazil, Canada, China, France, Japan, and Mali. This comparison will be used to identify strengths and weaknesses in the response, including challenges for health professionals and health systems. METHODS: We will use a multiple case study approach with multiple levels of nested analysis. We have chosen these countries as they represent different continents and different stages of the pandemic. We will focus on several major hospitals and two public health interventions (contact tracing and testing). It will employ a multidisciplinary research approach that will use qualitative data through observations, document analysis, and interviews, as well as quantitative data based on disease surveillance data and other publicly available data. Given that the methodological approaches of the project will be largely qualitative, the ethical risks are minimal. For the quantitative component, the data being used will be made publicly available. DISCUSSION: We will deliver lessons learned based on a rigorous process and on strong evidence to enable operational-level insight for national and international stakeholders.","Ridde, Valéry; Gautier, Lara; Dagenais, Christian; Chabrol, Fanny; Hou, Renyou; Bonnet, Emmanuel; David, Pierre-Marie; Cloos, Patrick; Duhoux, Arnaud; Lucet, Jean-Christophe; Traverson, Lola; de Araujo Oliveira, Sydia Rosana; Cazarin, Gisele; Peiffer-Smadja, Nathan; Touré, Laurence; Coulibaly, Abdourahmane; Honda, Ayako; Noda, Shinichiro; Tamura, Toyomitsu; Baba, Hiroko; Kodoi, Haruka; Zinszer, Kate",Health Res Policy Syst,,476

In this study, we evaluated the performance of the BD MAX Open System module for identifying viral pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, in nasopharyngeal specimens from individuals with symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection. We developed and validated a rapid total nucleic acid extraction method based on real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the reliable, high-throughput simultaneous detection of common cold viral pathogens using the BD MAX Platform. The system was evaluated using 205 nasopharyngeal swab clinical samples. For assessment of the limit of detection (LoD), we used SARS-CoV-2, influenza A/B, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) RNA standards. The BD MAX dual multiplex real-time RT-PCR panel demonstrated a sensitivity comparable to that of the World Health Organization-recommended SARS-CoV-2 assay with an LoD of 50 copies/PCR. The LoD of influenza A/B and RSV was 100-200 copies/PCR. The overall percent agreement between the BD MAX panel and laboratory-developed RT-PCR test on 55 SARS-CoV-2-positive clinical samples was 100%. Among the 55 positive cases of COVID-19 analysed, no coinfection was detected. The BD MAX rapid multiplex PCR provides a highly sensitive, robust, and accurate assay for the rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2, influenza A/B, and RSV.","Chung, Hsing-Yi; Jian, Ming-Jr; Chang, Chih-Kai; Lin, Jung-Chung; Yeh, Kuo-Ming; Chen, Chien-Wen; Chiu, Sheng-Kang; Wang, Yi-Hui; Liao, Shu-Jung; Li, Shih-Yi; Hsieh, Shan-Shan; Tsai, Shih-Hung; Perng, Cherng-Lih; Yang, Ji-Rong; Liu, Ming-Tsan; Chang, Feng-Yee; Shang, Hung-Sheng",Emerg Microbes Infect,,476
503468,"Health and medicine in a pandemic year: moving from the ""winter of despair"" to the ""spring of hope""",2020,"PURPOSE: Telehealth use is likely to increase as a result of practice changes during the COVID-19 pandemic, although the overall picture surrounding the billing, coding, and continued insurance coverage of these visits remains uncertain. The purpose of this study was to identify potential financial implications of continued telehealth use in hand and wrist surgery clinical practice. METHODS: Two hundred telehealth visits were randomly selected and matched 1:1 based on primary diagnosis code to in-person visits. Medical and billing records were reviewed to compare visit complexities, total visit charges, work relative value units (wRVUs), and approved insurance reimbursement. Postoperative visits and visits with radiographic evaluation were excluded. RESULTS: Level 4 visits were more common with in-person encounters compared to telehealth (11% vs 2%, respectively), and level 1 and 2 visits were more common with telehealth compared to in-person encounters (14% vs 6%, respectively). Twenty-seven in-person visits (13%) had at least 1 additional procedure code billed. The mean total visit charge was 26% less in telehealth compared to in-person. Based on the primary procedure code alone, the sum of wRVUs was 15.1 points less in the telehealth cohort compared to in-person (per visit average, 1.1 [telehealth] vs 1.2 [in-person]). The 28 additional services provided during in-person visits accounted for an added 20.7 wRVUs. Unpaid claims were more common among telehealth encounters (8% [telehealth] vs 3% [in-person]). CONCLUSIONS: Higher complexity visits and visits with additional procedural codes billed were more common with in-person visits. This led to a lower number of total wRVUs and lower total visit charges among the included telehealth visits compared to the matched in-person controls. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: It is important to understand and consider the long-term financial impact of telehealth implementation. Practices must develop strategies to incorporate radiographic evaluation into telehealth visits and effectively stratify those patients that may require procedural interventions for in-person visits. Understanding the economic implications of this changing care delivery paradigm, providers can continue to provide telehealth services while protecting the financial sustainability of hand surgery practices.","Tadley, Madeline; Henry, Tyler W; Horan, Dylan P; Beredjiklian, Pedro K",,,476

This think-piece highlights that parks, community gardens, and other natural areas are essential to urban dwellers, especially if directives to physically distance from one another become longstanding or recurrent. Public decision-makers should aim to develop simple, relatively inexpensive strategies to augment the usability of nature in innovative ways that make it possible to enjoy them while respecting distance guidelines. Also discussed is the notion that a predominant goal for social scientists and urban practitioners during this crisis will be to learn how people view the ways in which public parks and wilder urban areas mitigate their response to worry, isolation, and an altered form of civic engagement.

505354,COVID-19 and the Chinese Christian Community in Britain: Changing Patterns of Belonging and Division,2021,"PURPOSE: Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the door for SARS-CoV-2, expressed in critical metabolic tissues. So, it is rational that the new virus causes pleiotropic alterations in glucose metabolism, resulting in the complication of pre-existing diabetes's pathophysiology or creating new disease mechanisms. However, it seems that less attention has been paid to this issue. This review aimed to highlight the importance of long-term consequences and pleiotropic alterations in glucose metabolism following COVID-19 and emphasize the need for basic and clinical research in metabolism and endocrinology. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 shifts cellular metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis, which leads to a decrease in ATP generation. Together with metabolic imbalance, the impaired immune system elevates the susceptibility of patients with diabetes to this deadly virus. SARS-CoV-2-induced metabolic alterations in immune cells can result in hyper inflammation and a cytokine storm. Metabolic dysfunction may affect therapies against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The effective control of metabolic complications could prove useful therapeutic targets for combating COVID-19. It is also necessary to understand the long-term consequences that will affect patients with diabetes who survived COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Since the pathophysiology of COVID-19 is still mostly unknown, identifying the metabolic mechanisms contributing to its progression is essential to provide specific ways to prevent and improve this dangerous virus's detrimental effects. The findings show that the new virus may induce new-onset diabetes with uncertain metabolic and clinical features, supporting a potential role of COVID-19 in the development of diabetes.","Mahrooz, Abdolkarim; Muscogiuri, Giovanna; Buzzetti, Raffaella; Maddaloni, Ernesto",Endocrine,,476

In this study, we prepared core-shell particles using a melanin precursor polymer, that is, polytyrosine (PTy), as a shell layer by the oxidative polymerization of tyrosine ethyl ester (Ty) in the presence of cerium oxide (CeO2) core particles. Inspired by skin tanning, irradiating the CeO2@PTy core-shell particles with UV or natural sunlight caused melanization by extending the &#960;-conjugated length of PTy, producing colloidal particles with the ability to absorb light. The pellet samples consisting of CeO2@PTy particles appeared whitish because of multiple scattered light. In contrast, the light absorption capacity of CeO2@PTy UV or CeO2@PTy Sun particles after light irradiation suppressed scattered light, dramatically improving the visibility of the structural color of the pellet samples made from these particles. Thus, a new method has been developed to control the visualization of structural colors to the human eye by irradiating the melanin precursor polymer with light.","Okoshi, Taku; Iwasaki, Takeshi; Takahashi, Shimon; Iwasaki, Yasuhiko; Kishikawa, Keiki; Kohri, Michinari",Biomacromolecules,,476

Instruction was delivered using a student-centered design and discovery learning to teach computer programming problem solving. Data were collected from 39 students who did not undertake prior preparation for engaging in distance education. Social presence, learning outcomes and satisfaction towards the course were measured by previous well-established scales, respectively. The students’ learning outcomes were evaluated through their code development. At the end of the course, the students filled out an online questionnaire which measured these three variables. The results of this study showed that all three variables were evaluated as satisfactory by the students. The results also indicated that social presence and code development were positively associated with satisfaction. Moreover, the results of the regression analysis indicated that social presence and code development were critical factors affecting students’ satisfaction. Together, these two factors explain 39.9% of the variance of satisfaction. Social presence alone contributed about 32.3% of this variance, suggesting that it may be very important in predicting satisfaction. This study could prove useful to instructors in understanding which factors may influence the design and implementation of distance learning in higher education. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Koutromanos, G.; Bellou, I.; Mikropoulos, T.

Clinical experience of pregnancies complicated with infection by other coronaviruses e.g., Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome, has led to pregnant woman being considered potentially vulnerable to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Physiological changes during pregnancy have a significant impact on the immune system, respiratory system, cardiovascular function, and coagulation. These may have positive or negative effects on COVID-19 disease progression. The impact of SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy remains to be determined, and a concerted, global effort is required to determine the effects on implantation, fetal growth and development, labor, and neonatal health. Asymptomatic infection presents a further challenge regarding service provision, prevention, and management. Besides the direct impacts of the disease, a plethora of indirect consequences of the pandemic adversely affect maternal health, including reduced access to reproductive health services, increased mental health strain, and increased socioeconomic deprivation. In this review, we explore the current knowledge of COVID-19 in pregnancy and highlight areas for further research to minimize its impact for women and their children.","Wastnedge, Elizabeth A N; Reynolds, Rebecca M; van Boeckel, Sara R; Stock, Sarah J; Denison, Fiona C; Maybin, Jacqueline A; Critchley, Hilary O D",Physiol Rev,,476

This article studies the epidemiology and early transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in Karnataka, which would be useful for effective epidemic management and policy formulation. Materials and Methods All COVID-19 cases reported in the state of Karnataka, India, till June 12, 2020, are included in the study. The epidemiology and transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in Karnataka is studied through descriptive statistical analysis. Results The findings illustrate a gender-, age-, and region-based disparity in the susceptibility and fatality. There appears to be a male preponderance in the susceptibility, but a female preponderance in fatality. It is also found that the adults are more susceptible to the infection, while the elderly have the risk of high fatality. Further, infected individuals in the region with urbanization have a higher risk of fatality than other regions. The study shows that the chances of recovery for females are lower than males, and further, the chances of recovery are positively related to the age of the infected person. The chances of recovery are higher if the infected individual is younger and they diminish if the individual is older. The study also explores that the chances of recovery are affected by the patient's geographical location. It is also noted that individuals who returned from foreign travel have better chances of recovery than the locally transmitted individuals. Conclusion Though the risk of susceptibility to COVID-19 infection is equal to all, the burden of getting infected and the burden of fatality is unequally distributed among different demographic categories. To manage the contagious spread of epidemic, to reduce fatality, and to increase the chances of recovery, targeted policy actions are suggested to benefit the vulnerable demographic categories.","Venkatraja, B.; Srilakshminarayana, G.; Kumar, B.

Emerging data show that surgery in coronavirus disease (COVID)-positive cases can be associated with worsening of clinical outcomes and increased postoperative mortality. Hence, preoperative COVID-19 testing for all patients before elective surgery was implemented in our institution. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred and sixty-two asymptomatic cancer patients were preoperatively tested for COVID-19 using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction technique with nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabbing. All negative patients were operated within 72 hours, and positive patients were quarantined for a minimum 14 days before re-swabbing. RESULTS: In our cohort, 21 of 262 (8.0%) asymptomatic preoperative patients, who were otherwise fit for surgery, tested positive. After adequate quarantine and a negative follow-up test report, 12 of 21 (57%) had an operation. No major postoperative morbidity due to COVID-19 was noted during the immediate postoperative period before discharge from the hospital. CONCLUSION: Routine preoperative COVID-19 testing was successful in identifying asymptomatic viral carriers. There was no incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 disease in the postoperative period, and there was no incidence of morbidity attributable to COVID-19. These data suggested a beneficial role for mandatory preoperative COVID-19 testing.","Nekkanti, Sri Siddhartha; Vasudevan Nair, Sudhir; Parmar, Vani; Saklani, Avanish; Shrikhande, Shailesh; Sudhakar Shetty, Nitin; Joshi, Amit; Murthy, Vedang; Patkar, Nikhil; Khattry, Navin; Gupta, Sudeep",J. surg. oncol,,476

Food insecurity, which entails having limited or uncertain access to a sufficient quantity of nutritious food, is a key pandemic-related consequence. We examined how people enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) have been affected by the pandemic, particularly Black participants and participants residing in food deserts. METHODS: Using survey data from a longitudinal cohort study of predominantly Black low-income adults aged &#8805;18 residing in urban food deserts in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, we examined changes in food insecurity and SNAP participation before COVID-19 (2018) and early in the COVID-19 pandemic (March-May 2020). We modeled changes in food insecurity from 2018 to 2020 via covariate-adjusted logistic regression. RESULTS: Food insecurity increased significantly among participants enrolled in SNAP and surveyed in both 2018 and 2020 (from 25.9% in 2018 to 46.9% in 2020; P < .001). Compared with cohort participants not enrolled in SNAP at both points, cohort participants enrolled in SNAP in 2018 and 2020 had the highest rates of using a food bank in 2020 (44.4%) and being newly food insecure in 2020 (28.9%) (ie, they were food insecure in 2020 but not in 2018). CONCLUSIONS: Food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic increased among low-income Black households enrolled in SNAP and residing in a food desert.

508783,Trans Fat Free by 2023-A Building Block of the COVID-19 Response,2021,"AIM: To discuss available information on the opportunity for pregnant women affected by diabetes/obesity to receive COVID-19 vaccine. DATA SYNTHESIS: Pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection are at high risk for severe acute respiratory syndrome and adverse outcomes. Pregnant women with severe COVID-19 present increased rates of preterm delivery (<37 gestational weeks), cesarean delivery and neonatal admissions to the intensive care unit. Comorbidity such as diabetes (pregestational or gestational) or obesity further increased maternal and fetal complications. It is known that diabetic or obese patients with COVID-19 present an unfavorable course and a worse prognosis, with a direct association between worse outcome and suboptimal glycol-metabolic control or body mass index (BMI) levels. Critical COVID-19 infection prevention is important for both mother and fetus. Vaccination during pregnancy is a common practice. Vaccines against COVID-19 are distributed across the world with some population considered to have a priority. Since pregnant women are excluded from clinical trials very little information are available on safety and efficacy of COVD-19 vaccines during pregnancy. However, it is well known the concept of passive immunization of the newborn obtained with transplacental passage of protective antibodies into the fetal/neonatal circulation after maternal infection or vaccination. Moreover, it has been reported that COVID-19 vaccine-induced IgG pass to the neonates through breastmilk. Therefore, maternal vaccination can protect mother, fetus and baby.

509116,Streamlining the Value Chain Uploading Paper in Times of COVID-19,2020,"In many medical image classification tasks, there is insufficient image data for deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to overcome the over-fitting problem. The light-weighted CNNs are easy to train but they usually have relatively poor classification performance. To improve the classification ability of light-weighted CNN models, we have proposed a novel batch similarity-based triplet loss to guide the CNNs to learn the weights. The proposed loss utilizes the similarity among multiple samples in the input batches to evaluate the distribution of training data. Reducing the proposed loss can increase the similarity among images of the same category and reduce the similarity among images of different categories. Besides this, it can be easily assembled into regular CNNs. To appreciate the performance of the proposed loss, some experiments have been done on chest X-ray images and skin rash images to compare it with several losses based on such popular light-weighted CNN models as EfficientNet, MobileNet, ShuffleNet and PeleeNet. The results demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of our method in terms of classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity.","Huang, Zhiwen; Zhou, Quan; Zhu, Xingxing; Zhang, Xuming",Sensors (Basel),,476

RESULTS: The dynamic characteristics of lymphocyte and subsets in COVID-19 patients was that it reduced significantly at one week, rapidly elevated to the peak at two weeks after onset, then gradually declined during recovery. The COVID-19 critical illness patients with DM had the lowest decline at one week and the slow lowest rise at two weeks after onset, while COVID-19 non-critical illness patients with DM had the rapid highest rise at two weeks after onset, both of them had similar lymphocyte and subsets at five weeks after onset and lower than those patients without DM. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide a reference for clinicians that for COVID-19 patients with DM and the lowest decline of lymphocyte and subsets, immunomodulatory therapy as soon as possible might avoid or slow down disease progression; moreover for COVID-19 critical illness patients with or without DM and non-critical illness patients with DM, continuous immunomodulatory therapy in later stages of disease might speed up virus clearance, shorten hospital stay, improve disease prognosis in COVID-19 critical illness patients with DM.","Liu, Dafeng; Lan, Lijuan; Luo, Dongxia; Zhao, Bennan; Wei, Guo; He, Yinsheng; Zhang, Renqing; Liu, Yaling",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,,476

510592,Medical Education and Training Within Congenital Cardiology: Current Global Status and Future Directions in A Post COVID-19 World,2021,"Chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are derivatives of 4-aminoquinoline compounds with over 60 years of safe clinical usage. CQ and HCQ are able to inhibit the production of cytokines such as interleukin- (IL-) 1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-17, and IL-22. Also, CQ and HCQ inhibit the production of interferon- (IFN-) &#945; and IFN-Î³ and/or tumor necrotizing factor- (TNF-) &#945;. Furthermore, CQ blocks the production of prostaglandins (PGs) in the intact cell by inhibiting substrate accessibility of arachidonic acid necessary for the production of PGs. Moreover, CQ affects the stability between T-helper cell (Th) 1 and Th2 cytokine secretion by augmenting IL-10 production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Additionally, CQ is capable of blocking lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) triggered stimulation of extracellular signal-modulated extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 in human PBMCs. HCQ at clinical levels effectively blocks CpG-triggered class-switched memory B-cells from differentiating into plasmablasts as well as producing IgG. Also, HCQ inhibits cytokine generation from all the B-cell subsets. IgM memory B-cells exhibits the utmost cytokine production. Nevertheless, CQ triggers the production of reactive oxygen species. A rare, but serious, side effect of CQ or HCQ in nondiabetic patients is hypoglycaemia. Thus, in critically ill patients, CQ and HCQ are most likely to deplete all the energy stores of the body leaving the patient very weak and sicker. We advocate that, during clinical usage of CQ and HCQ in critically ill patients, it is very essential to strengthen the CQ or HCQ with glucose infusion. CQ and HCQ are thus potential inhibitors of the COVID-19 cytokine storm.","Richard, Seidu A; Kampo, Sylvanus; Hechavarria, Maite Esquijarosa; Sackey, Marian; Buunaaim, Alexis D B; Kuugbee, Eugene Dogkotenge; Anabah, Thomas Winsum",J Immunol Res,,476

510702,COVID-19: psychological effects on a COVID-19 quarantined population in Bangladesh,2020,"BACKGROUND: During outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), healthcare providers are facing critical clinical decisions based on the prognosis of patients. Decision support tools of risk stratification are needed to predict outcomes in patients with different clinical types of COVID-19. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study recruited 2425 patients with moderate or severe COVID-19. A logistic regression model was used to select and estimate the factors independently associated with outcomes. Simplified risk stratification score systems were constructed to predict outcomes in moderate and severe patients with COVID-19, and their performances were evaluated by discrimination and calibration. RESULTS: We constructed two risk stratification score systems, named as STPCAL (including significant factors in the prediction model: number of clinical symptoms, the maximum body temperature during hospitalization, platelet count, C-reactive protein, albumin and lactate dehydrogenase) and TRPNCLP (including maximum body temperature during hospitalization, history of respiratory diseases, platelet count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, and prothrombin time), to predict hospitalization duration for moderate patients and disease progression for severe patients, respectively. According to STPCAL score, moderate patients were classified into three risk categories for a longer hospital duration: low (Score 0-1, median = 8 days, with less than 20.0% probabilities), intermediate (Score 2-6, median = 13 days, with 30.0-78.9% probabilities), high (Score 7-9, median = 19 days, with more than 86.5% probabilities). Severe patients were stratified into three risk categories for disease progression: low risk (Score 0-5, with less than 12.7% probabilities), intermediate risk (Score 6-11, with 18.6-69.1% probabilities), and high risk (Score 12-16, with more than 77.9% probabilities) by TRPNCLP score. The two risk scores performed well with good discrimination and calibration. CONCLUSIONS: Two easy-to-use risk stratification score systems were built to predict the outcomes in COVID-19 patients with different clinical types. Identifying high risk patients with longer stay or poor prognosis could assist healthcare providers in triaging patients when allocating limited healthcare during COVID-19 outbreak.","Huang, Jiaqi; Xu, Yu; Wang, Bin; Xiang, Ying; Wu, Na; Zhang, Wenjing; Xia, Tingting; Yuan, Zhiquan; Li, Chengying; Jia, Xiaoyue; Shan, Yifan; Chen, Menglei; Li, Qi; Bai, Li; Li, Yafei",BMC Pulm Med,,476
510778,Obesity and COVID-19: what makes obese host so vulnerable?,2021,"We propose two synthetic microdata approaches to generate private tabular survey data products for public release. We adapt a pseudo posterior mechanism that downweights by-record likelihood contributions with weights $\in [0,1]$ based on their identification disclosure risks to producing tabular products for survey data. Our method applied to an observed survey database achieves an asymptotic global probabilistic differential privacy guarantee. Our two approaches synthesize the observed sample distribution of the outcome and survey weights, jointly, such that both quantities together possess a privacy guarantee. The privacy-protected outcome and survey weights are used to construct tabular cell estimates (where the cell inclusion indicators are treated as known and public) and associated standard errors to correct for survey sampling bias. Through a real data application to the Survey of Doctorate Recipients public use file and simulation studies motivated by the application, we demonstrate that our two microdata synthesis approaches to construct tabular products provide superior utility preservation as compared to the additive-noise approach of the Laplace Mechanism. Moreover, our approaches allow the release of microdata to the public, enabling additional analyses at no extra privacy cost.","Hu, Jingchen; Savitsky, Terrance D.; Williams, Matthew R.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.06188v2.pdf,476

510915,Evaluating prosocial COVID-19 messaging frames: Evidence from a field study on Facebook,2020,"Psychiatric symptoms are seen in some COVID-19 patients, as direct or indirect sequelae, but it is unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 infection interacts with underlying neuronal or psychiatric susceptibilities. Such interactions might arise from COVID-19 immune responses, from infection of neurons themselves or may reflect social-psychological causes. To clarify this we sought the key gene expression pathways altered in COVID-19 also affected in bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and schizophrenia, since this may identify pathways of interaction that could be treatment targets. We performed large scale comparisons of whole transcriptome data and immune factor transcript data in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from COVID-19 patients and patients with psychiatric disorders. We also analysed genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for symptomatic COVID-19 patients, comparing GWAS and whole-genome sequence data from patients with bipolar disorder, PTSD and schizophrenia patients. These studies revealed altered signalling and ontology pathways shared by COVID-19 patients and the three psychiatric disorders. Finally, co-expression and network analyses identified gene clusters common to the conditions. COVID-19 patients had peripheral blood immune system profiles that overlapped with those of patients with psychiatric conditions. From the pathways identified, PTSD profiles were the most highly correlated with COVID-19, perhaps consistent with stress-immune system interactions seen in PTSD. We also revealed common inflammatory pathways that may exacerbate psychiatric disorders, which may support the usage of anti-inflammatory medications in these patients. It also highlights the potential clinical application of multi-level dataset studies in difficult-to-treat psychiatric disorders in this COVID-19 pandemic.","Moni, Mohammad Ali; Lin, Ping-I; Quinn, Julian M W; Eapen, Valsamma",Transl Psychiatry,,476
510917,Evaluating prosocial COVID-19 messaging frames: Evidence from a field study on Facebook,2020,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a major global threat. Healthcare professionals including dentists are facing real challenges during this pandemic. This study aimed to evaluate knowledge, attitudes, and prevention measures of Lebanese dentists towards COVID-19 and determinants of high level of knowledge and prevention practices. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted between May and August 2020 in Lebanon on a random sample of 323 Lebanese dentists. Data were collected through an online survey questionnaire. A multivariate linear regression model was used to evaluate factors associated with COVID-19 knowledge. A multivariate logistic regression was conducted to evaluate the factors associated with high level of prevention measures towards COVID-19. RESULTS: The mean COVID-19 knowledge index was 24.5 over 38 with only 15% achieving high knowledge level. The mean prevention measures index was 11.4 over 16 with only 35% achieving high prevention level. Higher knowledge index was associated with younger age, being employed, and considering dentist's role significant in teaching others about COVID-19. General dental practitioners, dentists living with family members and concerned about their family members to get infected because of their occupational exposure were more likely to report higher level of adopted prevention measures. Higher knowledge was associated with high level of prevention measures. CONCLUSIONS: Given the rapid evolution of information related to COVID-19 pandemic, dentists should be regularly educated through trainings, workshops, and updates of national guidelines for dental healthcare.","Hleyhel, Mira; Haddad, Christine; Haidar, Nour; Charbachy, Maria; Saleh, Nadine",BMC Oral Health,,476

511784,Politicizing the virus. Sectarian tensions in the middle east at the time of Covid-19/ Politicizzare il virus. Tensioni settarie in medio oriente al tempo del Covid-19,2020,"L'infection à SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) est responsable d'une symptomatologie polymorphe avec l'atteinte pulmonaire comme principale cause de décès. La physiopathologie de cette infection virale est de plus en plus décrite et des facteurs pronostiques sont identifiés. Plusieurs études ont souligné le rôle crucial de la réponse interféron (IFN) dans la clairance virale. Cette réponse, altérée dans les formes sévères et critiques de COVID-19, est associée à une production excessive de cytokines pro-inflammatoires. La lymphopénie est également associée aux formes graves, les patients immunodéprimés sont à risque de forme sévère. L'Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) et le Torque-Teno Virus (TTV) sont associés à des états d'immunodépression. Quelques cas cliniques rapportent leurs réplications au cours de l'infection à SARS-CoV-2, notamment chez les patients en réanimation. Ainsi, il a été suspecté que la réplication de l'EBV et du TTV pouvait être le témoin d'une immunodépression sous-jacente et constituait un facteur pronostique au cours de l'infection à SARS-CoV-2. S'est aussi posée la question de formes particulières de la maladie chez ces patients. L'étude porte sur l'ensemble des patients atteints de COVID-19 hospitalisés en service de médecine interne dans un centre hospitalo-universitaire. Les critères d'inclusion comprenaient une PCR SARS-CoV-2 positive et la réalisation d'une PCR EBV sur sang total au cours du séjour. 130 patients ont été inclus consécutivement. 25 patients ont eu une PCR TTV sur sang total. L'ensemble des données cliniques, biologiques et radiologiques ont été collectées. Les données biologiques l'ont été au moment de la PCR EBV sauf pour la valeur maximale de la CRP, le nadir des lymphocytes et leur typage. La cohorte était composée de 61,53 % d'hommes avec un âge moyen de 63,31 ans. Un total de 38,46 % des patients avaient séjourné en réanimation avec un délai moyen de 2,59 jours. Neuf décès étaient dénombrés. 64,62 % des patients avaient été traités par déxaméthasone, 67,69 % par antibiotiques avec 19,23 % de surinfections documentées. 57,69 % des patients avaient une virémie positive pour l'EBV dont 50,67 % présentaient une charge virale (CV) supérieure à 1000 UI/ml. L'atteinte pulmonaire scannographique était plus importante chez les patients EBV+ que chez les EBV- (p -value &lt; 0,05). 42,67 % des patients EBV+ avaient séjourné en réanimation ou en USC contre 32,73 % des EBV- (p -value = 0,28) avec une durée de séjour plus longue (2,96 vs 2,09 jours, p -value = 0,28). Les patients EBV+ avec une CV &gt; 1000UI/ml avaient reçu de façon significative plus de déxaméthasone que les patients avec une CV &lt; 1000UI/ml (78,95 % vs 48,65 %, p -value &lt; 0,01). Le nadir des lymphocytes chez les patients EBV+ était inférieur à celui des patients EBV- (0,79 G/L vs 0,93 G/L, p -value = 0,051) avec un ratio CD4/CD8 abaissé (2,20 vs 2,85, p -value = 0,37). Les enzymes hépatiques étaient plus élevées chez les patients EBV+ (p &lt; 0,05), aucune différence n'existait pour les D-Dimères, le fibrinogène ou la CRP. 44,00 % des patients avaient une CV &gt; 1000 UI/ml pour le TTV, avec une tendance à des formes plus graves (45,45 % de patients hospitalisés en USC ou réanimation vs 28,57 % chez les patients avec une CV &lt; 1000 UI/ml, p -value = 0,43) et une durée de séjour plus longue (2,27 vs 1,21 jours, p-value = 0,35). Cette étude sur la réplication de l'EBV et du TTV chez les patients COVID-19 est la plus importante à ce jour. Malgré une hétérogénéité dans la date des prélèvements par rapport au début des symptômes, les patients avec une virémie détectable pour l'EBV présentaient des atteintes pulmonaires plus graves et une lymphopénie plus profonde. Ceci est corroboré par des séries de cas où la prévalence de l'EBV en réanimation était plus importante que celle décrite ici. La CV de l'EBV était aussi associée à des durées de séjour en réanimation plus longues. Le recours à la déxaméthasone plus fréquent chez les patients avec une CV de l'EBV &gt; 1000 UI/ml suggère une oxygénoréquérance plus grande. La CV de l'EBV pourrait donc constituer un marqueur d'immunodépression sous-jacente et représenter un facteur de mauvais pronostique au cours de l'infection à SARS-CoV-2, avec parfois des tableaux proches de syndromes d'activation lymphohistiocytaire. L'impact de la réplication du TTV est difficile à préciser en raison de l'effectif limité. L'effet de telles co-infections sur la réponse IFN serait intéressant à caractériser compte tenu de la valeur pronostique de celle-ci. Ces données suggèrent que les co-infections virales lors d'une infection à SARS-CoV-2 pourraient refléter un état d'immunodépression sous-jacent et être associées à un mauvais pronostique.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as a receptor that mediates the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into human cells, as in the case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Several studies have reported that ACE2 expression is higher in Leydig, Sertoli and seminiferous ductal cells of males, as well as in ovarian follicle cells of females, suggesting possible potential pathogenicity of the coronavirus in the reproductive system. Higher ACE2 expression in the human placenta and reports of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among clinical cases have increased the relevance of further studies in this area. This review focuses on the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and the ACE2 receptor and speculates on the mechanistic interplay in association with male and female reproductive physiology. In addition, based on the available literature, we discuss the alleged sex differences in terms of the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, which is claimed greater among males, and further explore the physiological role of ACE2 and 17ß-oestradiol for the same.","Sharma, G Taru; Chandra, Vikash; Mankuzhy, Pratheesh; Thirupathi, Yasotha; Swain, Dilip Kumar; Pillai, Harikrishna; Patel, Shailesh Kumar; Pathak, Mamta; Guttula, SaiKumar",Reprod Fertil Dev,,476

513804,A changed research landscape of youth's obesogenic behaviours and environments in the post-COVID-19 era,2020,"Introduction: As of December 19th 2020, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in approximately 17.6 million cases and 315,000 deaths in the United States. The hospitalization rate for COVID-19 in the US continues to rise and is currently around 295.8 hospitalizations per 100,000 population. Despite the increasing number of individuals who are contracting and recovering from this disease, little is known about their functional recovery. Understanding functional outcomes in these patients is critical to address their rehabilitation needs. The purpose of this study is to characterize the 30-day patient-reported functional outcomes of older and younger adults following acute hospitalization for COVID-19. Methods: A single-center prospective cohort study was performed from April to October 2020 of adult survivors of hospitalization for COVID-19 (n=28). A standardized telephone questionnaire was administered 30-days after hospital discharge to participants addressing their ability to perform basic activities of daily living (ADLs), instrumental ADLs, mobility, fatigue symptoms (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information Systems-PROMIS) and general disability (Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index - HAQ-DI). Results: Participants' were 23-95 years old. Twenty-one (75%) were less than 65 years old. Fifteen (54%) were female and 19 (68%) were white. Mean hospital length of stay was 11.3 days and 10 (36%) participants required ICU admission. Among adults aged &lt;65 years, 76% developed new functional impairments and 14% developed new dependence (requiring help to perform a task) post-COVID compared to pre-hospitalization baseline. In comparison, 71% of adults aged &gt;65 years developed new impairments and 29% new dependence. The most common new impairments in both age groups were transferring for basic ADLs and preparing meals and grocery shopping for instrumental ADLs. Seventy-one percent of older and 76% of younger adults experienced a decline in at least one mobility task (getting up from a chair, walking up 10 stairs, or walking mile). Seventy-six percent of younger adults and 43% of older adults experienced a clinically significant worsening (&gt; 5 points) in their PROMIS fatigue scores. Sixty-two percent of younger adults and 43% of older adults experienced a clinically significant worsening (&gt; 0.22 points) in their HAQ-DI scores. Conclusions: Among adults hospitalized with COVID-19, the majority experienced a decline in ≥1 functional task 30 days after discharge compared to pre-hospitalization. Younger adults had similar to worse impairment in physical functional outcomes than older adults. These results indicate all adults, regardless of age, are at risk for prolonged, clinically significant functional impairment following hospitalization for COVID-19.","Qin, E.; Gold, L.; Bunnell, A.; Andrews, J.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,,476

514239,Anosmia and ageusia as initial or unique symptoms after COVID-19 (Review article),2020,"The global pandemic of COVID-19 has rapidly increased the number of infected cases as well as asymptomatic individuals in many, if not all the societies around the world. This issue increases the demand for accurate and rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2. While accurate and rapid detection is critical for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2, the appropriate course of treatment must be chosen to help patients and prevent its further spread. Testing platform accuracy with high sensitivity and specificity for SARS-CoV-2 is equally important for clinical, regional, and global arenas to mitigate secondary transmission rounds. The objective of this article is to compare the current detection technology and introduce the most accurate and rapid ones that are suitable for pandemic circumstances. Hence, the importance of rapid detection in societies is discussed initially. Following this, the current technology for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 is explained and classified into three different categories: nucleic acid-based, protein-based, and point of care (PoC) detection testing. Then, the current issues for diagnostic procedures in laboratories are discussed. Finally, the role of new technologies in countering COVID-19 is also introduced to assist researchers in the development of accurate and timely detection of coronaviruses. As coronavirus continues to affect human lives in a detrimental manner, the development of rapid and accurate virus detection methods could promote COVID-19 diagnosis accessible to both individuals and the mass population at patient care. In this regard, rRT-PCR and multiplex RT-PCR detection techniques hold promise.","Rezvani Ghomi, Erfan Khosravi Fatemeh Mohseni-M Ali Nourbakhsh Nooshin Haji Mohammad Hoseini Mahsa Singh Sunpreet Hedenqvist Mikael S.; Ramakrishna, Seeram",Heliyon,,476
514727,On the role of governmental action and individual reaction on COVID-19 dynamics in South Africa: A mathematical modelling study,2020,"COVID-19 is a highly contagious new infection caused by the single-stranded RNA Sars-CoV-2 virus. For the first time, this infection was recorded in December 2019 in the Chinese province of Wuhan. The virus presumably crossed the interspecies barrier and passed to humans from a bat. Initially, the disease was considered exclusively in the context of damage to the respiratory system, but it quickly became clear that the disease also entails serious consequences from various systems, including the cardiovascular system. Among these consequences are myocarditis, myocardial damage, subsequent heart failure, myocardial infarction, and Takotsubo syndrome. On the other hand, clinical data indicate that the presence of chronic diseases in a patient aggravates the course and outcome of coronavirus infection. In this context, the relationship between COVID-19 and atherosclerosis, a condition preceding cardiovascular disease and other disorders of the heart and blood vessels, is particularly interesting. The renin-angiotensin system is essential for the pathogenesis of both coronavirus disease and atherosclerosis. In particular, it has been shown that ACE2, an angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, plays a key role in Sars-CoV-2 infection due to its receptor activity. It is noteworthy that this enzyme is important for the normal functioning of the cardiovascular system. Disruptions in its production and functioning can lead to various disorders, including atherosclerosis.","Poznyak, Anastasia V; Bezsonov, Evgeny E; Eid, Ali H; Popkova, Tatyana V; Nedosugova, Ludmila V; Starodubova, Antonina V; Orekhov, Alexander N",Int. j. mol. sci.

In Canada, over 80% of COVID-19 deaths during the first pandemic wave occurred in LTCFs. We sought to evaluate the effect of mitigation measures in LTCFs including frequent testing of staff, and vaccination of staff and residents. We developed an agent-based transmission model and parameterized it with disease-specific estimates, temporal sensitivity of nasopharyngeal and saliva testing, results of vaccine efficacy trials, and data from initial COVID-19 outbreaks in LTCFs in Ontario, Canada. Characteristics of staff and residents, including contact patterns, were integrated into the model with age-dependent risk of hospitalization and death. Estimates of infection and outcomes were obtained and 95% credible intervals were generated using a bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap method. Weekly routine testing of staff with 2-day turnaround time reduced infections among residents by at least 25.9% (95% CrI: 23.3%-28.3%), compared to baseline measures of mask-wearing, symptom screening, and staff cohorting alone. A similar reduction of hospitalizations and deaths was achieved in residents. Vaccination averted 2-4 times more infections in both staff and residents as compared to routine testing, and markedly reduced hospitalizations and deaths among residents by 95.9% (95% CrI: 95.4%-96.3%) and 95.8% (95% CrI: 95.5%-96.1%), respectively, over 200 days from the start of vaccination. Vaccination could have a substantial impact on mitigating disease burden among residents, but may not eliminate the need for other measures before population-level control of COVID-19 is achieved.","Vilches, Thomas N; Nourbakhsh, Shokoofeh; Zhang, Kevin; Juden-Kelly, Lyndon; Cipriano, Lauren E; Langley, Joanne M; Sah, Pratha; Galvani, Alison P; Moghadas, Seyed M",Prev Med,,476

This study aimed to characterize the association between clinical outcomes in patients with obesity and inflammatory markers. METHODS: We analyzed data for patients aged &#8805;18 years admitted with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. We used multivariate logistic regression to determine the association between BMI and intensive care unit (ICU) transfer and all-cause mortality. Inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein [CRP], lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], ferritin, and D-dimer) were compared between patients with and without obesity (body mass index [BMI] &#8805;30 kg/m2). RESULTS: Of 791 patients with Covid-19, 361 (45.6%) had obesity. In multivariate analyses, BMI &#8805;35 was associated with a higher odds of ICU transfer (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.388 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.074-5.310) and hospital mortality (aOR = 4.3, 95% CI: 1.69-10.82). Compared to those with BMI<30, patients with obesity had lower ferritin (444 vs 637 ng/mL; p<0.001) and lower D-dimer (293 vs 350 mcg/mL; p = 0.009), non-significant differences in CRP (72.8 vs 84.1 mg/L, p = 0.099), and higher LDH (375 vs 340, p = 0.009) on the first hospital day.

517952,Impact of the COVID-19 crisis: Analysis of the fishing and shellfishing sectors performance in Galicia (Spain),2021,"PURPOSE: During the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the activity of Emergency Departments worldwide changed dramatically, focusing on diagnosis and care of the Sars-Cov-2 associated disease. These major changes also involved the activity of the Emergency Radiology Department (ERD). This study aimed to analyse the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on imaging studies, both in terms of the amount, frequency and subspecialty of different imaging modalities requested to the ERD of the Maggiore della Carità Hospital in Novara (Italy). METHODS: To this end, our observational study took into account the imaging studies requested by the emergency department during three-time spans. These were defined as phase 0 (pre-pandemic), phase 1 (pandemic peak with complete lockdown) and phase 2 (post-pandemic peak with partial lifting of restrictive measures), as derived from Italian urgent decrees by the President of the Council of Ministers (DPCM) which established the duration and entity of the lockdown measures throughout the pandemic. The dataset was processed and then compared with Pearson's chi-squared test. RESULTS: During the pandemic peak, our data showed a significant drop in the total number of studies requested and a significant rise in computed tomography (CT) studies. In particular, a statistically significant increase in chest CT studies was found, probably due to the high sensitivity of this imaging method in identifying pulmonary involvement during respiratory tract infection of possible viral etiology (SARS-Cov-2). Moreover, we observed a statistically significant decrease of X-ray (XR) and ultrasound (US) studies during phase 1 compared to phase 0 and phase 2 probably due to a reduction in the numbers of ER visits for minor traumas given the mobility restrictions and people hesitancy in visiting the ER due to fear of contagion. CONCLUSIONS: We can conclude that the activity of the ERD was heavily impacted by the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic. Further studies will be needed to estimate the impact of the pandemic on public health in terms of excess mortality related to delayed diagnosis and care of non-COVID diseases.","Garlisi, C; Licandro, D; Siani, A; Rodolfi, S; Pansini, S; Garcia Navarro, L I; Carriero, A; Avanzi, G C; Castello, L M",Emerg Radiol,,476

Here, we analyzed the impact of COVID-19 infection in renal patients to assess the time to viral clearance, together with the production and persistence of IgG and IgM antibody response, in consideration of the altered immune capacity of this fragile population. METHODS: Viral clearance and antibody kinetics were investigated in 49 renal patients recovered from COVID-19 infection: 7 of them with chronic decompensated renal failure, 31 under dialysis treatment, and 11 kidney transplant recipients. RESULTS: The time span between the diagnosis of infection and recovery based on laboratory testing (2 negative nasopharyngeal swabs in consecutive days) was 31.7 ± 13.3 days. Three new positive cases were detected from 8 to 13 days following recovery. At the first serological determination after swab negativization, all the patients developed IgG and IgM antibodies. The semiquantitative analysis showed a progressive increase in IgG and a slow reduction in IgM. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: In subjects with decompensated chronic kidney disease, under dialysis and in transplant recipients, viral clearance is lengthened compared to the general population. However, in spite of their common status of immunodepression, all of them were able to produce specific antibodies. These data might provide useful insights for monitoring and planning health-care activities in the weak category of patients with compromised renal function recovered from COVID-19.","Bruno, Paolo Ferdinando; Cappuccilli, Maria; Spazzoli, Alessandra; De Liberali, Matteo; Sejdiu, Brunilda; Napoli, Marianna; Minerva, Vera; Semprini, Simona; Dirani, Giorgio; Sambri, Vittorio; Buscaroli, Andrea; Rigotti, Angelo; Mancini, Elena; Masperi, Paolo; La Manna, Gaetano; Mosconi, Giovanni",Nephron,,476

We describe the clinic transition to virtual visits in April 2020 and reflect on our six-month experience in virtual visits. Clinic metrics were tracked. Electronic survey responses were collected from caregivers attending virtual visits. Input from the MGH DSP team was collected. From April to September 2020, we maintained patient volume (45 visits per month) and overall satisfaction score (6.7 out of 7) following a sudden, unanticipated transition to virtual visits. Survey of 17 caregivers attending virtual visits found that most were equipped with technology, had access to a private location, and most were able to access visit without any limitations. Caregivers appreciated the convenience of virtual visits but sometimes missed the personal connection of an in-person visit. Overall, though, virtual visits were frequently viewed as no different than office visits. Team members identified benefits and challenges of virtual visits, as well as lessons learned from this transition. We were able to maintain multidisciplinary, specialty care with optimal caregiver feedback and sustained number of patient visits.","Santoro, Stephanie L; Donelan, Karen; Haugen, Kelsey; Oreskovic, Nicolas M; Torres, Amy; Skotko, Brian G",,,476

We collected data from 214 dual working parents and analyzed the results using the IMB SPSS version 26.0 software. We found that positive psychological capital had significant effects on both family cohesion (ß = 0.19, p < 0.001) and health promotion behaviors (ß = 0.26, p < 0.001), while family cohesion showed a significant mediating effect on health promotion behaviors (ß = 0.34, p = 0.002). Positive psychological capital (independent variable) also had significant effects on health promotion behaviors (ß = 0.19, p < 0.001). Finally, a Sobel test showed that family cohesion had a significant partial mediating effect on the relationship between positive psychological capital and health promotion behaviors (Z = 2.70, p = 0.005) but no moderating effect. Thus, it is necessary to enhance health promotion behaviors through programs focused on both family cohesion and positive psychological capital.

METHODS: We analyzed data from monthly suicide statistics between January 2017 and October 2020 and from online surveys on mental health filled out by the general population in Japan. RESULTS: Compared to the 2017-19 period, the number of suicide deaths during the initial phase of the pandemic was lower than average but exceeded the past trend from July 2020. Female suicides, whose numbers increased by approximately 70% in October 2020 (incidence rate ratio: 1.695, 95% confidence interval: 1.558-1.843), were the main source of this increase. The largest increase was found among young women (less than 40 years of age). Our survey data indicated that the status of young women's mental health has been deteriorating in recent months and that young female workers were more likely to have experienced a job or income loss than any other group, suggesting adverse economic conditions surrounding them. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous monitoring of mental health, particularly that of the most vulnerable populations identified in this study, and appropriate suicide prevention efforts are necessary during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ueda, Michiko; Nordström, Robert; Matsubayashi, Tetsuya",J. public health (Oxf),,476

The virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. Human infection with SARS-CoV-2 leads to a wide range of clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic, mild, moderate to severe. The severe cases present with pneumonia, which can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome. The outbreak provides an opportunity for real-time tracking of an animal coronavirus that has just crossed species barrier to infect humans. The outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection is largely determined by virus-host interaction. Here, we review the discovery, zoonotic origin, animal hosts, transmissibility and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 in relation to its interplay with host antiviral defense. A comparison with SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, community-acquired human coronaviruses and other pathogenic viruses including human immunodeficiency viruses is made. We summarize current understanding of the induction of a proinflammatory cytokine storm by other highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, their adaptation to humans and their usurpation of the cell death programmes. Important questions concerning the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and host antiviral defence, including asymptomatic and presymptomatic virus shedding, are also discussed.","Fung, Sin-Yee; Yuen, Kit-San; Ye, Zi-Wei; Chan, Chi-Ping; Jin, Dong-Yan",Emerg Microbes Infect,,476

METHODS: From March 14 to April 6, 2020, 72 non-hospitalized patients referred by the emergency department to CTPA for COVID-19 pneumonia were retrospectively identified. Relevant clinical and laboratory data and CT scan findings were collected for each patient. CTPA scans were reviewed by two radiologists to determinate the presence or absence of APE. Clinical classification, lung involvement of COVID-19 pneumonia, and CT total severity score were compared between APE group and non-APE group. RESULTS: APE was identified in 13 (18%) CTPA scans. The mean age and D-dimer of patients from the APE group were higher in comparison with those from the non-APE group (74.4 vs. 59.6 years, p = 0.008, and 7.29 vs. 3.29 µg/ml, p = 0.011). There was no significant difference between APE and non-APE groups concerning clinical type, COVID-19 pneumonia lung lesions (ground-glass opacity: 85% vs. 97%; consolidation: 69% vs. 68%; crazy paving: 38% vs. 37%; linear reticulation: 69% vs. 78%), CT severity score (6.3 vs. 7.1, p = 0.365), quality of CTPA (1.8 vs. 2.0, p = 0.518), and pleural effusion (38% vs. 19%, p = 0.146). CONCLUSIONS: Non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia referred to CT scan by the emergency departments are at risk of APE. The presence of APE was not limited to severe or critical clinical type of COVID-19 pneumonia.

521377,Characteristics associated with hospitalisation for COVID-19 in people with rheumatic disease: data from the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance physician-reported registry,2020,"BACKGROUND: The global COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on European health and social care systems, with demands on testing, hospital and intensive care capacity exceeding available resources in many regions. This has led to concerns that some vulnerable groups, including autistic people, may be excluded from services. METHODS: We reviewed policies from 15 European member states, published in March-July 2020, pertaining to (1) access to COVID-19 tests; (2) provisions for treatment, hospitalisation and intensive care units (ICUs); and (3) changes to standard health and social care. In parallel, we analysed survey data on the lived experiences of 1301 autistic people and caregivers. RESULTS: Autistic people experienced significant barriers when accessing COVID-19 services. First, despite being at elevated risk of severe illness due to co-occurring health conditions, there was a lack of accessibility of COVID-19 testing. Second, many COVID-19 outpatient and inpatient treatment services were reported to be inaccessible, predominantly resulting from individual differences in communication needs. Third, ICU triage protocols in many European countries (directly or indirectly) resulted in discriminatory exclusion from lifesaving treatments. Finally, interruptions to standard health and social care left over 70% of autistic people without everyday support. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated existing healthcare inequalities for autistic people, probably contributing to disproportionate increases in morbidity and mortality, mental health and behavioural difficulties, and reduced quality of life. An urgent need exists for policies and guidelines on accessibility of COVID-19 services to be updated to prevent the widespread exclusion of autistic people from services, which represents a violation of international human rights law.","Oakley, Bethany; Tillmann, Julian; Ruigrok, Amber; Baranger, Aurélie; Takow, Christian; Charman, Tony; Jones, Emily; Cusack, James; Doherty, Mary; Violland, Pierre; Wroczynska, Agnieszka; Simonoff, Emily; Buitelaar, Jan K; Gallagher, Louise; Murphy, Declan G M",BMJ Open,,476

METHODS: A systematic review with network meta-analysis, surface under the cumulative ranking analysis and stochastic multicriteria acceptability analyses were performed. Searches were conducted in Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science without limits for time-frame or language. Randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy or safety of any PDE5i compared to a placebo or to other PDE5i in males with erectile disfunction were included. RESULTS: Overall, 184 articles representing 179 randomized controlled trials (50,620 patients) were included. All PDE5i were significantly more efficient than placebo. Sildenafil 25 mg was statistically superior to all interventions in enhancing IIEF (with a 98% probability of being the most effective treatment), followed by sildenafil 50 mg (80% of probability). Taladafil 10 mg and 20 mg also presented good profiles (73% and 76%, respectively). Avanafil and lodenafil were less effective interventions. Mirodenafil 150 mg was the treatment that caused more adverse events, especially flushing and headaches. Sildenafil 100 mg was more related to visual disorders, while vardenafil and udenafil were more prone to cause nasal congestion. CONCLUSION: Sildenafil at low doses and tadalafil should be the first therapeutic options. Avanafil, lodenafil and mirodenafil use are hardly justified given the lack of expressive efficacy or high rates of adverse events.","Madeira, Camilla R; Tonin, Fernanda S; Fachi, Mariana M; Borba, Helena H; Ferreira, Vinicius L; Leonart, Leticia P; Bonetti, Aline F; Moritz, Rogerio P; Trindade, Angela C L B; Gonçalves, Alan G; Fernandez-Llimos, Fernando; Pontarolo, Roberto",World j. urol,,476

We then performed additional lipidomics analyses of the 60 subjects with the lowest and highest body mass index, either COVID-19 positive or negative. Omics data were correlated to detailed data on patient characteristics and clinical laboratory assays measuring coagulation, hematology and chemistry analytes. Significant changes in arginine/proline/citrulline, tryptophan/indole/kynurenine, fatty acid and acyl-carnitine metabolism emerged as highly relevant markers of disease severity, progression and prognosis as a function of biological and clinical variables in these patients. Further, machine learning models were trained by entering all metabolomics and clinical data from half of the COVID-19 patient cohort and then tested on the other half yielding ~ 78% prediction accuracy. Finally, the extensive amount of information accumulated in this large, prospective, observational study provides a foundation for follow-up mechanistic studies and data sharing opportunities, which will advance our understanding of the characteristics of the plasma metabolism in COVID-19 and other acute critical illnesses.","D039,; Alessandro, A.; Akpan, I.; Thomas, T.; Reisz, J.; Cendali, F.; Gamboni, F.; Nemkov, T.; Thangaraju, K.; Katneni, U.; Tanaka, K.; Kahn, S.; Wei, A.; Valk, J.; Hudson, K.; Roh, D.; Moriconi, C.; Zimring, J.; Hod, E.; Spitalnik, S.; Buehler, P.; Francis, R.",,,476

This paper seeks to study the impact of innovations on OFD –new product/services– that aim to enhance the experiential value when ordering food online. Moreover, this paper analyses the willingness to order food delivery online during the COVID-19 pandemic. An experimental design survey was therefore used. The participants assessed one out of four OFD innovation options, its experiential value, and their own willingness to order it. Participants’ fear of COVID-19 was measured and used as a moderator variable. A conditional process analysis was used to reveal that innovation in the OFD business can increase the experiential value for the consumer, but this effect should be examined in light of customers’ fear of COVID-19. Managerial implications and future research lines are suggested.","Gavilan, Diana Balderas-Cejudo Adela Fernández-Lores Susana Martinez-Navarro Gema",International journal of gastronomy and food science,,476

524052,Coming Back from Covid-19: Lessons in Entrepreneurship from Disaster Recovery Research,2020,"Public health recommendations and governmental measures during the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic have enforced numerous restrictions on daily living including social distancing, isolation, and home confinement. While these measures are imperative to mitigate spreading of COVID-19, the impact of these restrictions on psychosocial health is undefined. Therefore, an international online survey was launched in April 2020 to elucidate the behavioral and lifestyle consequences of COVID-19 restrictions. This report presents the preliminary results from more than one thousand responders on social participation and life satisfaction. METHODS: Thirty-five research organizations from Europe, North-Africa, Western Asia, and the Americas promoted the survey through their networks to the general society, in 7 languages (English, German, French, Arabic, Spanish, Portuguese, and Slovenian). Questions were presented in a differential format with questions related to responses ""before"" and ""during"" confinement conditions. RESULTS: 1047 participations (54% women) from Asia (36%), Africa (40%), Europe (21%), and others (3%) were included in the analysis. Findings revealed psychosocial strain during the enforced COVID-19 home confinement. Large decreases (p < 0.001) in the amount of social activity through family (-58%), friends/neighbors (-44.9%), or entertainment (-46.7%) were triggered by the enforced confinement. These negative effects on social participation were also associated with lower life satisfaction (-30.5%) during the confinement period. Conversely, the social contact score through digital technologies significantly increased (p < 0.001) during the confinement period with more individuals (+24.8%) being socially connected through digital technology. CONCLUSION: These preliminary findings elucidate the risk of psychosocial strain during the early COVID-19 home confinement period in 2020. Therefore, in order to mitigate the negative psychosocial effects of home confinement, implementation of national strategies focused on promoting social inclusion through a technology-based solution is strongly suggested.","Ammar, Achraf; Chtourou, Hamdi; Boukhris, Omar; Trabelsi, Khaled; Masmoudi, Liwa; Brach, Michael; Bouaziz, Bassem; Bentlage, Ellen; How, Daniella; Ahmed, Mona; Mueller, Patrick; Mueller, Notger; Hsouna, Hsen; Aloui, Asma; Hammouda, Omar; Paineiras-Domingos, Laisa Liane; Braakman-Jansen, Annemarie; Wrede, Christian; Bastoni, Sophia; Pernambuco, Carlos Soares; Mataruna, Leonardo; Taheri, Morteza; Irandoust, Khadijeh; Khacharem, Aïmen; Bragazzi, Nicola L; Strahler, Jana; Washif, Jad Adrian; Andreeva, Albina; Khoshnami, Samira C; Samara, Evangelia; Zisi, Vasiliki; Sankar, Parasanth; Ahmed, Waseem N; Romdhani, Mohamed; Delhey, Jan; Bailey, Stephen J; Bott, Nicholas T; Gargouri, Faiez; Chaari, Lotfi; Batatia, Hadj; Ali, Gamal Mohamed; Abdelkarim, Osama; Jarraya, Mohamed; Abed, Kais El; Souissi, Nizar; Gemert-Pijnen, Lisette Van; Riemann, Bryan L; Riemann, Laurel; Moalla, Wassim; Gómez-Raja, Jonathan",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,476

Healthcare workers (HCWs) are among the first group to receive vaccination, so it is important to consider their attitudes about COVID-19 vaccination to better address barriers to widespread vaccination acceptance. METHODS: We conducted a cross sectional study to assess the attitude of HCWs toward COVID-19 vaccination. Data were collected between 7 October and 9 November 2020. We received 4080 responses out of which 3479 were complete responses and were included in the final analysis. RESULTS: 36% of respondents were willing to take the vaccine as soon as it became available while 56% were not sure or would wait to review more data. Only 8% of HCWs do not plan to get vaccine. Vaccine acceptance increased with increasing age, education, and income level. A smaller percentage of female (31%), Black (19%), Lantinx (30%), and rural (26%) HCWs were willing to take the vaccine as soon as it became available than the overall study population. Direct medical care providers had higher vaccine acceptance (49%). Safety (69%), effectiveness (69%), and speed of development/approval (74%) were noted as the most common concerns regarding COVID-19 vaccination in our survey.","Shekhar, Rahul; Sheikh, Abu Baker; Upadhyay, Shubhra; Singh, Mriganka; Kottewar, Saket; Mir, Hamza; Barrett, Eileen; Pal, Suman",,,476

Prospective comparative studies with non-CoViD-19 ICU patients are completely lacking. OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of the incidence of DVT in ICU patients with CoViD-19 compared to non-CoViD-19 ICU patients who were treated in the University Hospital Augsburg during the same period. In addition, the aim was to investigate what type of anticoagulation was present in CoViD-19 patients at the time the DVT occurred and to what extent DVT is associated with increased mortality in this patient population. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this prospective single center study, which was conducted between 18 April 2020 and 30 April 2020, 20 SARS-CoV2 positive patients were compared with 20 non-CoVid-19 patients in the ICU with respect to the occurrence of DVT. For this purpose, demographic data, laboratory parameters, and clinical outcomes were recorded and evaluated. RESULTS: The rate of DVT in the investigated patient collective was markedly higher in patients with SARS-CoV2 (CoViD-19 patients 20% vs. non-CoViD-19 patients 5%). Both DVT and elevated D­dimer levels were associated with increased mortality in the present study. CONCLUSION: We recommend the determination of D­dimer levels and, in the case of elevated levels, the broad indication for compression sonography of the deep leg veins on admission of patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV2. In this way DVT in the setting of CoViD-19 can be recognized early and therapeutic anticoagulation can be started. All inpatient CoViD-19 patients should receive thrombosis prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin. Further studies on point of care methods (TEG®, ROTEM®) for the detection of hypercoagulability in SARS-CoV2 are necessary.","Zerwes, Sebastian; Hernandez Cancino, F; Liebetrau, D; Gosslau, Y; Warm, T; Märkl, B; Hyhlik-Dürr, A",Chirurg,,476

589890,Crowdsourcing COVID-19: A brief analysis of librarian posts on Reddit,2021-07-09,"The Fourier representations (FRs) are indispensable mathematical formulations for modeling and analysis of physical phenomena and engineering systems. This study presents a new set of generalized Fourier representations (GFRs) and phase transforms (PTs). The PTs are special cases of the GFRs and true generalizations of the Hilbert transforms. In particular, the Fourier transform based kernel of the PT is derived and its various properties are discussed. The time derivative and integral, including fractional order, of a signal are obtained using the GFR. It is demonstrated that the general class of time-invariant and time-variant filtering operations, analog and digital modulations can be obtained from the proposed GFR. A narrowband Fourier representation for the time-frequency analysis of a signal is also presented using the GFR. A discrete cosine transform based implementation, to avoid end artifacts due to discontinuities present in the both ends of a signal, is proposed. A fractional-delay in a discrete-time signal using the FR is introduced. The fast Fourier transform implementation of all the proposed representations is developed. Moreover, using the analytic wavelet transform, a wavelet phase transform (WPT) is proposed to obtain a desired phase-shift in a signal under-analysis. A wavelet quadrature transform (WQT) is also presented which is a special case of the WPT with a phase-shift of [Formula: see text] radians. Thus, a wavelet analytic signal representation is derived from the WQT. Theoretical analysis and numerical experiments are conducted to evaluate effectiveness of the proposed methods.","Singh, Pushpendra",Digit Signal Process,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1051200420301755; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsp.2020.102830; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051200420301755?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834705/,476

Methods: Here we used data from proactive sampling carried out in New York City from fall 2016 to spring 2018. We combined weekly nasal swab collection with self-reports of respiratory symptoms from 191 participants to investigate the profile of recurring infections with endemic coronaviruses. Results: During the study, 12 individuals tested positive multiple times for the same coronavirus. We found no significant difference between the probability of testing positive at least once and the probability of a recurrence for the beta-coronaviruses HKU1 and OC43 at 34 weeks after enrollment/first infection. We also found no significant association between repeat infections and symptom severity but strong association between symptom severity and belonging to the same family. Conclusion: This study provides evidence that re-infections with the same endemic coronavirus are not atypical in a time window shorter than 1 year and that the genetic basis of innate immune response may be a greater determinant of infection severity than immune memory acquired after a previous infection.","Galanti, M.; Shaman, J.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.27.20082032v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.27.20082032,476

The disease will inevitably place an overwhelming burden on healthcare systems that cannot be effectively dealt with by existing facilities or responses based on conventional approaches. We believe that a rigorous clinical and societal response can only be mounted by using intelligence derived from a variety of data sources to better utilize scarce healthcare resources, provide personalized patient management plans, inform policy, and expedite clinical trials. In this paper, we introduce five of the most important challenges in responding to COVID-19 and show how each of them can be addressed by recent developments in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). We argue that the integration of these techniques into local, national, and international healthcare systems will save lives, and propose specific methods by which implementation can happen swiftly and efficiently.

Here we studied a prospective cohort of individuals with long COVID (the ADAPT study) compared to age/gender matched subjects without long COVID, healthy donors and individuals infected with other non-SARS CoV2 human coronaviruses (the ADAPT-C study). We found an elevated diffuse serum inflammatory cytokine profile in symptomatic long COVID subjects that was maintained at 8 months post-infection and was not observed in asymptomatic COVID-19 survivors. This inflammatory profile consisted of 15 cytokines that positively correlated; revealing an apparent diffuse, potentially coordinated, low level up regulation of a spectrum of immune and inflammatory mediators. In addition, we found an absence of subsets of un-activated naive T and B cells in peripheral blood of long COVID subjects, that did not reconstitute over time. In contrast, individual serum cytokines from the interferon I and III classes, T cell activation markers and plasma ACE2, while elevated in the serum of people previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 were not further elevated in subjects with long COVID symptoms.

Most disease is caused by a small number of meningococcal genotypes known as hyperinvasive lineages. As these are also carried asymptomatically, acquisition of them alone cannot explain why only some hosts develop meningococcal disease. Our aim was to determine whether genetic diversity in CEACAM is associated with susceptibility to meningococcal disease. Frequency distributions of alleles, genotypes and haplotypes were compared in four CEACAM genes in 384 case samples and 190 controls. Linkage disequilibrium among polymorphic sites, haplotype structures and relationships were also analysed. A number of polymorphisms were observed in CEACAM genes but the diversity of CEACAM1, to which most Opa proteins bind, was lower, and a small number of high-frequency haplotypes were detected. Dose-dependent associations of three CEACAM haplotypes with meningococcal disease were observed, with the effect of carrying these haplotypes amplified in homozygous individuals. Two haplotypes were protective while one haplotype in CEACAM6 was associated with a twofold increase in disease susceptibility. These data imply that human CEACAM may be one determinant of human susceptibility to meningococcal disease.","Callaghan, M J; Rockett, K; Banner, C; Haralambous, E; Betts, H; Faust, S; Maiden, M C J; Kroll, J S; Levin, M; Kwiatkowski, D P; Pollard, A J",Genes Immun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17960155/,476

It is unknown to which extent presymptomatic residents and staff contribute to the spread of the virus. AIMS: To assess the contribution of asymptomatic and presymptomatic residents and staff in SARS-CoV-2 transmission during a large outbreak in a Dutch NH. METHODS: Observational study in a 185-bed NH with two consecutive testing strategies: testing of symptomatic cases only, followed by weekly facility-wide testing of staff and residents regardless of symptoms. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal testing with RT-PCR for SARs-CoV-2, including sequencing of positive samples, was conducted with a standardized symptom assessment. RESULTS: 185 residents and 244 staff participated. Sequencing identified one cluster. In the symptom-based test strategy period 3/39 residents were presymptomatic versus 38/74 residents in the period of weekly facility-wide testing (p-value<0.001). In total, 51/59 (91.1%) of SARS-CoV-2 positive staff was symptomatic, with no difference between both testing strategies (p-value 0.763). Loss of smell and taste, sore throat, headache or myalga was hardly reported in residents compared to staff (p-value <0.001). Median Ct-value of presymptomatic residents was 21.3, which did not differ from symptomatic (20.8) or asymptomatic (20.5) residents (p-value 0.624). CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms in residents and staff are insufficiently recognized, reported or attributed to a possible SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, residents without (recognized) symptoms showed the same potential for viral shedding as residents with symptoms. Weekly testing was an effective strategy for early identification of SARS-Cov-2 cases, resulting in fast mitigation of the outbreak.","van den Besselaar, Judith H; Sikkema, Reina S; Koene, Fleur M H P A; van Buul, Laura W; Oude Munnink, Bas B; Frénay, Ine; te Witt, René; Koopmans, Marion P G; Hertogh, Cees M P M; Buurman, Bianca M",Age Ageing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33963830/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ageing/afab081,476

However, descriptions of such collaborations between the human, animal and environmental health sectors are still limited for French-speaking tropical countries. The objective of the current survey was to explore the diversity of OH experiences applied to research, surveillance and control of NTDs by scientists from French-speaking countries, and discuss their constraints and benefits. Six zoonotic NTDs were targeted: echinococcoses, trypanosomiases, leishmaniases, rabies, Taenia solium cysticercosis and leptospiroses. Invitations to fill in an online questionnaire were sent to members of francophone networks on NTDs and other tropical diseases. Results from the questionnaire were discussed during an international workshop in October 2019. The vast majority (98%) of the 171 respondents considered OH approaches relevant although only 64% had implemented them. Among respondents with OH experience, 58% had encountered difficulties mainly related to a lack of knowledge, interest and support for OH approaches by funding agencies, policy-makers, communities and researchers. Silos between disciplines and health sectors were still strong at both scientific and operational levels. Benefits were reported by 94% of respondents with OH experience, including increased intellectual stimulation, stronger collaborations, higher impact and cost-efficiency of interventions. Recommendations for OH uptake included advocacy, capacity-building, dedicated funding, and higher communities’ involvement. Improved research coordination by NTD networks, production of combined human-animal health NTD impact indicators, and transversal research projects on diagnostic and reservoirs were also considered essential.","Molia, Sophie; Saillard, Juliette; Dellagi, Koussai; Cliquet, Florence; Bart, Jean-Mathieu; Rotureau, Brice; Giraudoux, Patrick; Jannin, Jean; Debré, Patrice; Solano, Philippe",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0009246; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33661894/,476

Weather conditions can have an important impact on race time and we therefore examined the influence of environmental conditions (i.e., temperature, sunshine, precipitation, barometric pressure, and cloud cover) on WRs and elite (i.e., winner, top three and top 10 finishers) marathon performances of men and women at the “Berlin Marathon” between 1974 and 2019. Average world record marathon times in men were 2:03:52 ± 0:01:19 h:min:s and 2:25:05 ± 0:08:25 h:min:s in females (p < 0.05). Male competitions were held 44 times (mean winning time: 2:09:48 ± 0:09:15 h:min:s) and female competitions 41 times (mean winning time: 02:30:35 ± 0:19:09 h:min:s; p < 0.05). World record performances were set at mean temperatures of 18.61 ± 2.59°C for men and 13.07 ± 4.01°C for women (p > 0.05). The ideal environmental conditions for world record performances for men were temperatures of 18.61°C (p > 0.05), sunny, mostly dry days, with higher atmospheric pressure and little cloud cover (all p > 0.05). In women, ideal conditions for world records performances were temperatures of 13.07°C (p > 0.05), with low atmospheric pressure (p > 0.05), but significantly more rain (p < 0.05), and with no sunshine (p < 0.05) and cloud cover (p < 0.05).

593637,"Vignette on Canetti, crowds, and the self in times of COVID-19",2020-08-11,"BACKGROUND: An ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading globally. Recently, several articles have mentioned that the early acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by COVID-19 significantly differ from those of ARDS due to other causes. Actually, we newly observed that some mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients recovering from severe ARDS (more than 14 days after invasive ventilation) often experienced evidently gradual increases in CO(2) retention and minute ventilation. However, the underlying mechanics remain unclear. CASE PRESENTATION: To explain these pathophysiological features and discuss the ventilatory strategy during the late phase of severe ARDS in COVID-19 patients, we first used a metabolic module on a General Electric R860 ventilator (Engstrom Carestation; GE Healthcare, USA) to monitor parameters related to gas metabolism, lung mechanics and physiological dead space in two COVID-19 patients. We found that remarkably decreased ventilatory efficiency (e.g., the ratio of dead space to tidal volume 70–80%, arterial to end-tidal CO(2) difference 18–23 mmHg and ventilatory ratio 3–4) and hypermetabolism (oxygen consumption 300–400 ml/min, CO(2) elimination 200–300 ml/min) may explain why these patients experienced more severe respiratory distress and CO(2) retention in the late phase of ARDS caused by COVID-19. CONCLUSION: During the recovery period of ARDS among mechanically-ventilated COVID-19 patients, attention should be paid to the monitoring of physiological dead space and metabolism. Tidal volume (8–9 ml/kg) could be increased appropriately under the limited plateau pressure; however, barotrauma should still be kept in mind.","Xia, Jingen; Feng, Yingying; Li, Min; Yu, Xin; Zhang, Yi; Duan, Jun; Zhan, Qingyuan",BMC Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-020-05360-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32854630/,476

594039,Using Google Trends Data to Track Healthcare Use for Hand Osteoarthritis,2021-03-09,"The COVID-19 pandemic has posed unique challenges for families and caregivers, as well as for autism-focused clinicians, who are faced with providing a thorough and accurate evaluation of children's specific needs and diagnoses in the absence of in-person assessment tools. The shift to telehealth assessments has challenged clinicians to reconsider approaches and assumptions that underlie the diagnostic assessment process, and to adopt new ways of individualizing standard assessments according to family and child needs. Mandates for physical distancing have uncovered deficiencies in diagnostic practices for suspected autism and have illuminated biases that have posed obstacles preventing children and families from receiving the services that they truly need. This Commentary outlines several considerations for improving diagnostic practices as we move forward from the current pandemic and continue to strive to build an adaptable, sustainable, equitable, and family-centered system of care. LAY SUMMARY: Physical distancing and the abrupt end to in-person services for many children on the autism spectrum has forced clinicians to examine the existing challenges with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnostic assessment and consider things they want to keep and things that should be changed in the years ahead. New approaches such as telehealth both alleviated and exacerbated existing disparities, and brought into stark focus the importance of equitable and timely access to family-centered care. This commentary suggests ways of improving clinical practices related to ASD assessment to continue along this path.","Zwaigenbaum, Lonnie; Bishop, Somer; Stone, Wendy L; Ibanez, Lisa; Halladay, Alycia; Goldman, Sylvie; Kelly, Amy; Klaiman, Cheryl; Lai, Meng-Chuan; Miller, Meghan; Saulnier, Celine; Siper, Paige; Sohl, Kristin; Warren, Zachary; Wetherby, Amy",Autism research (Online),https://doi.org/10.1002/aur.2615; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34553489/,476
594581,Estimating the impact of interventions against COVID-19: from lockdown to vaccination,2021-03-26,"Sever acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) virus, responsible for severe acute respiratory disease (COVID-19). A large number of natural compounds are under trial for screening compounds, possessing potential inhibitory effect against the viral infection. Keeping in view the importance of marine compounds in antiviral activity, we investigated the potency of some marine natural products to target SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro)) (PDB ID 6MO3). The crystallographic structure of M(pro) in an apo form was retrieved from Protein Data Bank and marine compounds from PubChem. These structures were prepared for docking and the complex with good docking score was subjected to molecular dynamic (MD) simulations for a period of 100 ns. To measure the stability, flexibility, and average distance between the target and compounds, root mean square deviations (RMSD), root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), and the distance matrix were calculated. Among five marine compounds, C-1 (PubChem CID 11170714) exhibited good activity, interacting with the active site and surrounding residues, forming many hydrogen and hydrophobic interactions. The C-1 also attained a stable dynamic behavior, and the average distance between compound and target remains constant. In conclusion, marine natural compounds may be used as a potential inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 for better management of COVID-19.

594629,COVID‐19: Assessment of knowledge and awareness in Indian society,2020-08-27,"This review aims to substantiate attributions of priority for the discovery and first description of the levator palpebrae superioris (LPS) muscle to Matteo Realdo Colombo [Columbus] (1516–1559), and to describe the history of this muscle from ancient to modern times. METHODS: Relevant chapters on eyelid and eye muscles in Colombo’s De re anatomica (1559) were translated, and the work was further analyzed from a historical perspective. Literature on the anatomy of human eyelid and orbital striated muscles was reviewed from the publication of the Fabrica (1543) by Andreas Vesalius (1514–1564) through modern times. The discovery of the LPS was viewed in relation to other milestones along the road that led to the establishment of the subspecialty of oculofacial and orbital plastic surgery. RESULTS: The first description of the LPS appeared in De re anatomica (1559) by Colombo who correctly identified the LPS as a retractor of the (upper) eyelid and the orbicularis oculi as its protractor. The current lack of recognition of the priority of Colombo’s description of the LPS stemmed from his lifelong rivalries with other anatomists, improved descriptions of the orbital muscles by Gabriele Falloppio (1523–1562) that soon followed, and historical controversies over other anatomical discoveries. CONCLUSIONS: Colombo discovered the LPS and described the antagonistic functions of retractors and protractors of the eyelid, just a portion of his broader contributions to anatomy. Colombo’s discoveries of such ophthalmologic and oculofacial plastic surgical importance should be added to the ongoing reappraisals of Colombo by medical historians.","Reifler, David M.",Ophthalmic Plast Reconstr Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33315840/; https://doi.org/10.1097/iop.0000000000001867,476
594677,Adaptability Promotes Student Engagement Under COVID-19: The Multiple Mediating Effects of Academic Emotion,2021-01-06,"Macrophages are widely distributed in tissues and function in homeostasis. During cancer development, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) dominatingly support disease progression and resistance to therapy by promoting tumor proliferation, angiogenesis, metastasis, and immunosuppression, thereby making TAMs a target for tumor immunotherapy. Here, we started with evidence that TAMs are highly plastic and heterogeneous in phenotype and function in response to microenvironmental cues. We pointed out that efforts to tear off the heterogeneous “camouflage” in TAMs conduce to target de facto protumoral TAMs efficiently. In particular, several fate-mapping models suggest that most tissue-resident macrophages (TRMs) are generated from embryonic progenitors, and new paradigms uncover the ontogeny of TAMs. First, TAMs from embryonic modeling of TRMs and circulating monocytes have distinct transcriptional profiling and function, suggesting that the ontogeny of TAMs is responsible for the functional heterogeneity of TAMs, in addition to microenvironmental cues. Second, metabolic remodeling helps determine the mechanism of phenotypic and functional characteristics in TAMs, including metabolic bias from macrophages’ ontogeny in macrophages’ functional plasticity under physiological and pathological conditions. Both models aim at dissecting the ontogeny-related metabolic regulation in the phenotypic and functional heterogeneity in TAMs. We argue that gleaning from the single-cell transcriptomics on subclonal TAMs’ origins may help understand the classification of TAMs’ population in subclonal evolution and their distinct roles in tumor development. We envision that TAM-subclone-specific metabolic reprogramming may round-up with future cancer therapies.","Zhang, Xiao-Mei; Chen, De-Gao; Li, Shengwen Calvin; Zhu, Bo; Li, Zhong-Jun",Cells,https://doi.org/10.3390/cells10040903; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33919979/,476
594724,Rapid Uptake of Home-Based HIV Self-testing During Social Distancing for SARS-CoV2 Infection in Oregon,2020-06-27,"Viruses exploit the translation machinery of an infected cell to synthesize their proteins. Therefore, viral mRNAs have to compete for ribosomes and translation factors with cellular mRNAs. To succeed, eukaryotic viruses adopt multiple strategies. One is to circumvent the need for m(7)G-cap through alternative instruments for ribosome recruitment. These include internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs), which make translation independent of the free 5′ end, or cap-independent translational enhancers (CITEs), which promote initiation at the uncapped 5′ end, even if located in 3′ untranslated regions (3′ UTRs). Even if a virus uses the canonical cap-dependent ribosome recruitment, it can still perturb conventional ribosomal scanning and start codon selection. The pressure for genome compression often gives rise to internal and overlapping open reading frames. Their translation is initiated through specific mechanisms, such as leaky scanning, 43S sliding, shunting, or coupled termination-reinitiation. Deviations from the canonical initiation reduce the dependence of viral mRNAs on translation initiation factors, thereby providing resistance to antiviral mechanisms and cellular stress responses. Moreover, viruses can gain advantage in a competition for the translational machinery by inactivating individual translational factors and/or replacing them with viral counterparts. Certain viruses even create specialized intracellular “translation factories”, which spatially isolate the sites of their protein synthesis from cellular antiviral systems, and increase availability of translational components. However, these virus-specific mechanisms may become the Achilles’ heel of a viral life cycle. Thus, better understanding of the unconventional mechanisms of viral mRNA translation initiation provides valuable insight for developing new approaches to antiviral therapy.","Sorokin, Ivan I.; Vassilenko, Konstantin S.; Terenin, Ilya M.; Kalinina, Natalia O.; Agol, Vadim I.; Dmitriev, Sergey E.",Biochemistry (Mosc),https://doi.org/10.1134/s0006297921090042; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34565312/,476

595062,Could COVID-19 Cause ‘Biopharming’ to Bloom?: Research and Regulation,2020,"Introduction Le SARS-CoV-2, est apparu en Chine fin décembre 2019, pour se répandre dans le monde et en France en 2020. Pour faire face à cette pandémie, des mesures sanitaires de confinement national ont été appliquées en France, un premier confinement de mars à mai 2020, le second d’octobre à novembre 2020 et un troisième débuté en mars 2021. Cette pandémie et les mesures de confinement peuvent avoir un impact sur les patients ayant une pathologie chronique dont les patients vivants avec le VIH (PVVIH). Les objectifs de cette étude étaient de déterminer la prévalence déclarée de l’infection à SARS-CoV-2 dans une cohorte de PVVIH et d’évaluer l’impact de la pandémie et des mesures sanitaires sur leur suivi et leur prise en charge médicale. Matériels et méthodes Il s’agit d’une étude prospective, interventionnelle, multicentrique. Depuis le mois de janvier 2021, les PVVIH suivis dans 3 centres hospitaliers et disposant d’une adresse email dans leur dossier médical NADIS® ont été invités à compléter tous les mois un questionnaire en ligne (plateforme Limesurvey®). Ce questionnaire comporte des données socioprofessionnelles et médicales concernant la COVID-19 et leur suivi habituel. Les sérologies SARS-CoV-2 ont été proposées aux patients se rendant dans les centres dans le cadre de leur suivi. Résultats Au total, 421 PVVIH sur 1426 ont répondu au questionnaire. À la date du 26 mars 2021, la prévalence d’infection à SARS-CoV-2 était de 5,5 %. Sur les 23 PVVIH infectés, 12 ont été confirmés par PCR, 9 par sérologie et 3 (0,7 %) ont été hospitalisés. Cependant, 51 PVVIH (12,1 %) déclaraient avoir ressenti des signes d’infection à SARS-CoV-2. Lors du premier confinement national, 96 PVVIH (22,8 %) ont poursuivi une activité professionnelle présentielle totale et/ou partielle ; 17 PVVIH (4 %) ont exprimé une difficulté à accéder et poursuivre leur traitement antirétroviral et 87 (20 %) n’ont pas pu bénéficier de leur consultation de suivi du VIH. Durant le deuxième confinement, 176 PVVIH (41,8 %) ont poursuivi une activité professionnelle présentielle totale et/ou partielle. Ils étaient 9 patients (2,1 %) à avoir présenté des difficultés d’accès à leur traitement et 32 (7,6 %) à ne pas avoir pu bénéficier de leur consultation de suivi. Conclusion Dans cette étude, la prévalence de COVID-19 chez les PVVIH est similaire à celle de la population générale française évaluée entre 3 à 7 % sur la même période. Un impact des mesures sanitaires est démontré sur le suivi et la prise en charge des PVVIH, surtout lors du premier confinement national, plus strict que le second et probablement aussi en raison de la nécessité d’une réorganisation des services pour les accompagner au mieux. L’étude est toujours en cours et sera poursuivie jusqu’au 30/06/2022. Elle nous permettra d’évaluer l’évolution de la prévalence de la COVID-19 chez ces PVVIH mais aussi d’évaluer l’impact des modifications de l’organisation des services hospitaliers réalisées dans l’objectif d’optimiser la prise en charge des PVVIH en période de crise sanitaire.","Bronner, L.; Robineau, O.; Ajana, F.; Huleux, T.; Schmit, J.

595074,Considerations of coronavirus (COVID-19) impact and the management of the dead in Brazil,2020-05-28,"BACKGROUND: Influenza-like illness can cause excess paediatric morbidity and burden on parents. OBJECTIVES: We determined the quality of life (QoL) impact of children’s influenza-like illness (ILI) on their parents. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study in childcare centres and a general practice in Sydney, Australia. Using PAR-ENT-QoL, we measured QoL of parents of children aged 6 months–3 years before the 2010 influenza season, then again for parents of children with ILI (ILI group) using SF-12v2 Acute Form and PAR-ENT-QoL, and contemporaneously for parents of aged-matched children without ILI (non-ILI group). RESULTS: Of 381 children enrolled from 90 childcare centres, 105 developed ILI. PAR-ENT-QoL scores of the ILI group were significantly lower in the post-ILI follow-up interviews than at baseline (60.99 vs. 79.77, p < 0.001), and those of non-ILI group at follow-up interviews (60.99 vs. 84.05, p < 0.001). SF-12v2 scores of the ILI group were also significantly lower than those of non-ILI group: physical component summary (50.66 vs. 53.16, p = 0.011) and mental component summary (45.67 vs. 53.66, p < 0.001). Two factors were significantly associated with parental QoL: total time spent caring child during ILI and whether the child had severe ILI or not. Correlations between PAR-ENT-QoL and SF-12v2 scores were satisfactory. CONCLUSIONS: Parents had significantly lower QoL while their child had ILI, compared with before ILI and with parents of children without ILI. The public health impact of ILI in children on the QoL in families is far from negligible. QoL measurement can complement economic evaluation of ILI disease burden and provide a more complete picture of impact.","Chow, Maria Yui Kwan; Yin, Jiehui Kevin; Heron, Leon; Morrow, Angela; Dierig, Alexa; Booy, Robert; Leask, Julie",Qual Life Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24370954/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11136-013-0606-3,476

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the performances of a newly designed real-time RT-PCR (Simplexa™ COVID-19 Direct assay), that is established with an all-in-one reagent mix and no separate extraction required. RESULTS: The lower limit of detection (LOD) for both target genes resulted the same: 3.2 (CI: 2.9–3.8) log10 cp/mL and 0.40 (CI: 0.2–1.5) TCID50/mL for S gene while 3.2 log10 (CI: 2.9–3.7) log10 cp/mL and 0.4 (CI: 0.2–1.3) TCID50/mL for ORF1ab. The LOD obtained with extracted viral RNA for both S gene or ORF1ab was 2.7 log10 cp/mL. Crossreactive analysis performed in 20 nasopharyngeal swabs confirmed a 100% of clinical specificity of the assay. Clinical performances of Simplexa™ COVID-19 Direct assay were assessed in 278 nasopharyngeal swabs tested in parallel with Corman's method. Concordance analysis showed an ""almost perfect"" agreement in SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection between the two assays, being κ = 0.938; SE = 0.021; 95% CI = 0.896-0.980. CONCLUSIONS: The high sensitivity and specificity of this new assay indicate that it is promising for laboratory diagnosis, enabling highspeed detection in just over one hour, which is significantly faster than the up to five hours currently required by traditional extraction followed by amplification technologies, thus allowing prompt decision making regarding isolation of infected patients.","Bordi, Licia; Piralla, Antonio; Lalle, Eleonora; Giardina, Federica; Colavita, Francesca; Tallarita, Monica; Sberna, Giuseppe; Novazzi, Federica; Meschi, Silvia; Castilletti, Concetta; Brisci, Angela; Minnucci, Giulia; Tettamanzi, Veronica; Baldanti, Fausto; Capobianchi, Maria Rosaria",J Clin Virol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S138665322030158X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S138665322030158X?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388470/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104416,476

Methods This prospective observational cohort study enrolled 63 ventilated adult patients with ARDS; 50 as septic and 13 as non-septic, and followed them for 28 days in intensive care units at a university hospital in Taiwan. Serial serum sTREM-1 levels and cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-α, on days 1, 3, 5, 7 and 14 were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The association between biomarkers and clinical infectious diagnosis/outcome in ARDS was explored. Results Serum sTREM-1 and cytokine levels could not differentiate septic from non-septic ARDS. Serum log sTREM-1 and inflammatory cytokine levels were correlated positively (r = 0.325 for IL-1β; r = 0.247 for IL-8; r = 0.480 for tumor necrosis factor-α). As prognostic factors, higher serum sTREM-1 level on day 1 and increasing levels over time, especially in the first 5 days, were independent predictors of mortality on day 28, using a multivariate Cox regression model. Serum sTREM-1 levels remained stable or even increased in the non-surviving patients, but decreased in the survivors. Conclusion Serum sTREM-1 level might not be a reliable marker for infection in ARDS patients. However, as an inflammatory marker, initial serum sTREM-1 level and its trend over time, especially in the first 5 days, could be predictive of short-term mortality. A progressive decline in serum sTREM-1 levels during follow-up indicates a favorable outcome, whereas persistently elevated sTREM-1 indicates a poor prognosis and should lead to a re-evaluation of therapy.","Lin, Ming-Tzer; Wei, Yu-Feng; Ku, Shih-Chi; Lin, Chih-An; Ho, Chao-Chi; Yu, Chong-Jen",Journal of the Formosan Medical Association,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0929-6646(10)60125-8; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0929664610601258; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21126652/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929664610601258,476

However, there is no available tool that can rapidly and precisely distinguish between these two diseases in the absence of laboratory evidence of specific pathogens. METHODS: Laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and influenza patients between December 1, 2019 and February 29, 2020, from Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University (ZHWU) and Wuhan No.1 Hospital (WNH) located in Wuhan, China, were included for analysis. A machine learning-based decision model was developed using the XGBoost algorithms. RESULTS: Data of 357 COVID-19 and 1893 influenza patients from ZHWU were split into a training and a testing set in the ratio 7:3, while the dataset from WNH (308 COVID-19 and 312 influenza patients) was preserved for an external test. Model-based decision tree selected age, serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and circulating monocytes as meaningful indicators for classifying COVID-19 and influenza cases. In the training, testing and external sets, the model achieved good performance in identifying COVID-19 from influenza cases with a corresponding area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.94 (95% CI 0.93, 0.96), 0.93 (95% CI 0.90, 0.96), and 0.84 (95% CI: 0.81, 0.87), respectively. CONCLUSION: Machine learning provides a tool that can rapidly and accurately distinguish between COVID-19 and influenza cases. This finding would be particularly useful in regions with massive co-occurrences of COVID-19 and influenza cases while limited resources for laboratory testing of specific pathogens.","Zhou, Xianlong; Wang, Zhichao; Li, Shaoping; Liu, Tanghai; Wang, Xiaolin; Xia, Jian; Zhao, Yan",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,https://doi.org/10.2147/rmhp.s291498; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33623450/,476

The study used ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to examine the within-subject associations of day-level PA with same-day evening affect. Interactions between daily PA and overall stress related to COVID-19 predicting evening affect were also examined. Adults living in the U.S. (N = 157, M(age) = 31.7, 84.1% female) participated in a 28-day smartphone-based EMA study during the early months of the pandemic (April–June 2020). Evening EMA surveys assessed daily PA minutes, momentary positive activated and deactivated affect, and momentary negative activated and deactivated affect. An online questionnaire assessed demographics. Multi-level linear regression models assessed day-level associations between PA and evening affect, controlling for age, sex, income, body mass index, employment status, and morning affect. There were N = 2409 person-days in the analysis. Baseline COVID-19 stress was not associated with daily PA minutes (p = .09) or positive-activated affect (p = .14), but was associated with lower positive-deactivated affect (p < .001) and greater negative-activated and negative-deactivated affect (ps < .001) in the evenings. On days when individuals reported more PA than usual, they reported greater positive-activated and positive-deactivated affect, and lower negative-activated and negative-deactivated affect in the evening (ps < .001). The interaction of day-level PA and COVID-19 stress predicting evening positive-activated, positive-deactivated, negative-activated, and negative-deactivated affect was not significant (ps > .05). During the early months of the pandemic, adults experienced improved evening affect on days when they engaged in more PA. However, data did not show that PA counteracts detrimental effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on evening affect. Public health efforts should strategically promote and address barriers to PA during the pandemic.","Do, Bridgette; Wang, Shirlene D.; Courtney, Jimikaye B.; Dunton, Genevieve F.",Psychol Sport Exerc,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S146902922100128X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S146902922100128X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychsport.2021.102010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34366714/,476

We use a new class of satellite measurements acquired during several days in 2019 and 2020 to perform the first regional-scale and high-resolution survey of methane sources in the Permian. We find an unexpectedly large number of extreme point sources (37 plumes with emission rates >500 kg hour(−1)), which account for a range between 31 and 53% of the estimated emissions in the sampled area. Our analysis reveals that new facilities are major emitters in the area, often due to inefficient flaring operations (20% of detections).

The role of chemokines in rabies pathogenesis and protection has only recently been investigated. Expression of chemokines is induced by infection with laboratory-adapted, but not street, rabies viruses (RABVs), and it has been hypothesized that expression of chemokines is one of the mechanisms by which RABV is attenuated. To further define the role of chemokines in rabies pathogenesis and protection, chemokine genes such as MIP-1α, RANTES, IP-10, and macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC) have been cloned into RABV genome. It has been found that recombinant RABVs expressing RANTES or IP-10 induce high and persistent expression of these chemokines, resulting in massive infiltration of inflammatory cells into the central nervous system (CNS) and development of diseases and death in the mouse model. However, recombinant RABVs expressing MIP-1α, MDC, as well as GM-CSF further attenuate RABV by inducing a transient expression of chemokines, infiltration of inflammatory cells, enhancement of blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability. Yet, these recombinant RABVs show increased adaptive immune responses by recruiting/activating dendritic cells, T and B cells in the periphery as well as in the CNS. Further, direct administration of these recombinant RABVs into the CNS can prevent mice from developing rabies days after infection with street RABV. All these studies together suggest that chemokines are both protective and pathogenic in RABV infections. Those with protective roles could be exploited for development of future RABV vaccines or therapeutic agents.","Niu, Xuefeng; Wang, Hualei; Fu, Zhen F.",Adv Virus Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123870407000056; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21601043/; https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-387040-7.00005-6; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123870407000056,476

OBJECTIVES: This systematic review investigated the prognostic value of myocardial fibrosis as assessed by late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) on c-MRI in patients with ICM for ventricular tachyarrhythmia, sudden cardiac death (SCD), or all-cause mortality. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the electronic databases Pubmed and Embase for relevant prospective English-language studies published between January 1990 and February 2019. All included articles were prospective studies that comprised of human participants greater than 18 years old with ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) and a primary or secondary prevention ICD, had a sample size >30 participants, had at least 6 months follow-up, and reported on ventricular tachyarrhythmia, SCD and all-cause mortality. A total of 90 articles related to ICM were identified and were subsequently screened independently by two authors. Pooled sensitivity and specificity of LGE were calculated using random-effects model. RESULTS: Eight studies with 1085 participants were included in the final analysis. The mean age of patients varied from 43–83 years, with most patients being men. The most common comorbidities reported included history of diabetes mellitus (22–62%), hyperlipidemia (40–86%), and hypertension (35–88%). The ejection fraction of each study was reported as mean or median, and varied from 22–35%. During a follow-up that ranged from 8.5 to 65 months, there were 110 ventricular arrhythmic events reported. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of LGE for ICD therapy delivered for ventricular arrhythmias were 0.79 (95% Cl: 0.66–0.87) and 0.28 (95% Cl: 0.14–0.46) respectively. For all-cause mortality, the pooled sensitivity and specificity of LGE were 0.76 (95% Cl: 0.40–0.93) and 0.41 (95% Cl: 0.14–0.75) respectively. While SCD was of significant interest to our review, only one of the studies reported on the association between LGE and SCD leading to the subsequent exclusion of SCD from the endpoint analysis. CONCLUSION: LGE has high prognostic value in predicting adverse outcomes in patients with ICM and may provide helpful information for clinical decision-making related to SCD prevention. Our findings illustrate how LGE may improve current risk stratification, prognostication and selection of patients with ICM for ICD therapy.","Chery, Godefroy; Kamp, Nicholas; Kosinski, Andrzej S.; Schmidler, Gillian Sanders; Lopes, Renato D.; Patel, Manesh; Al-Khatib, Sana M.",Am Heart J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32916608/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002870320302271; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ahj.2020.08.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002870320302271?v=s5,476

The COVID-19 crisis has severely worsened the environment in which we live and in which our future generations are being shaped, and will lead to loss of future human potential and capital. It is clear that the COVID-19 pandemic does not only harm the current world population, but also affects our future, as well as that of future generations. The science of transgenerational plasticity demonstrates that investments in early life hold the promise of having beneficial effects across multiple generations. As governments are reopening societies and prioritising policies, their overarching goal should be to improve the environment in which future generations grow and develop, learn and live. This will change the lifetime trajectories of children for the better and affect future health, school success, behaviour, productivity and well-being.

A fundamental characteristic of the CD8 T lymphocyte pool is that it is composed of millions of clones; each with a unique T cell receptor capable of recognizing a limited number of peptides displayed at the cell surface bound to the grooves of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) molecules. Naïve CD8 T lymphocytes are normally resting and circulate between the blood and secondary lymphoid organs in search of their cognate peptide–MHC complexes. During viral infections, bone marrow–derived professional antigen-presenting cells (pAPCs) in secondary lymphoid organs display viral peptides on their MHC I molecules. Specific CD8 T lymphocytes that recognize these peptide–MHC adducts become activated (primed), proliferate extensively, and develop into effectors capable of killing infected cells, identified by the presence at their surface of the pertinent viral peptide–MHC complexes. This article describes how the process of priming naïve CD8 T lymphocytes occurs.","Sigal, Luis J.",Encyclopedia of Immunobiology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123742797140093; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123742797140093,476
602396,Student Nurses Undertaking Acute Hospital Paid Placements during COVID-19: Rationale for Opting-In? A Qualitative Inquiry,2021-08-05,"It is widely believed that infection with the SARS-CoV2 virus triggers a disproportionate immune response which causes a devastating systemic injury, particularly in individuals with obesity, itself a chronic, multi-organ inflammatory disease. Immune cells accumulate in visceral adipose tissue and together with paracrine adipocytes release a wide range of biologically active cytokines (including IL-1β, IL5, IL6 and IL8) that can result in both local, pulmonary and systemic inflammation. A more intense ‘cytokine storm’ is postulated as the mechanism behind the extreme immune response seen in severe COVID-19. It is striking how dangerous the combination of obesity and COVID-19 is, resulting in a greater risk of ICU admission and a higher mortality. Furthermore, patients from a BAME background appear to have increased mortality after SARS-CoV2 infection; they also have a higher prevalence of central obesity and its metabolic complications. In the absence of an effective vaccine, the therapeutic potential of immune-modulating drugs is a priority, but the development of new drugs is expensive and time-consuming. A more pragmatic solution would be to seek to repurpose existing drugs, particularly those that might suppress the heightened cytokine activity seen in obesity, the major risk factor for a poor prognosis in COVID-19. Montelukast is a cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist licensed to treat asthma and allergic rhinitis. It has been shown to diminish pulmonary response to antigen, tissue eosinophilia and IL-5 expression in inflammatory cells. It has also been shown to decrease elevated levels of IL-1β and IL8 in humans with viral upper respiratory tract infections compared with placebo-treated patients. In addition, in silico studies have demonstrated a high binding affinity of the montelukast molecule to the terminal site of the virus’s main protease enzyme which is needed for virus RNA synthesis and replication. Montelukast, which is cheap, safe and widely available would appear to have the potential to be an ideal candidate drug for clinical trials, particularly in early stage disease before irreparable tissue damage has already occurred. HYPOTHESIS: Through a direct anti-viral effect, or by suppression of heightened cytokine release in response to SARS-CoV2, montelukast will reduce the severity of immune-mediated multiorgan damage resulting from COVID-19, particularly in patients with central obesity and metabolic syndrome.","Qutayba Almerie, Muhammad; Daniel Kerrigan, David",Med Hypotheses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32492562/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109883; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987720311488?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987720311488,476
602544,Data Resource Profile: COVerAGE-DB: a global demographic database of COVID-19 cases and deaths,2021-05-15,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Globally, the ongoing pursuit in exploring an effective drug to combat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus has not met with significant success to date. Indian traditional medicines, especially polyherbal formulations like Nilavembu Kudineer (NVK) and Kaba Sura Kudineer (KSK) of the Siddha system of medicine, have been used as public health interventions for controlling viral epidemics like dengue and Chikungunya. These traditional therapies have been found safe, effective, and widely accepted. The current study evaluates the comparative efficacy of NVK and KSK as opposed to the placebo, in the management of mild to moderate COVID-19 disease. METHODS: The study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled comparative clinical trial, with the primary objective of determining the efficacy of KSK and NVK. Patients (n=125) diagnosed with mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms were enrolled in the study over a period of 4 months (Aug 2020—Dec 2020). Participants were randomized into 3 arms; placebo-decaffeinated tea in Arm I, NVK in Arm II, and KSK in Arm III. Each arm received 60 ml of the respective treatment twice a day, post morning and evening meals, along with standard allopathy treatment for a maximum of 10 days. The main outcome measures of the study were the reduction in SARS-CoV-2 viral load, hospital stay, and time taken by the patients to become asymptomatic from symptomatic. Efficacy assessments included clinical symptoms (fever, cough, and breathlessness) each day and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), liver function test (LFT), renal function test (RFT), and electrolytes and electrocardiogram (ECG) at baseline (day 0) and days 3, 6, and 10. Post-treatment, participants were followed up for 30 days via phone for adverse effects if any. Effects of drugs on inflammatory markers (IL6) at the end of treatment were also recorded. Adverse events (AE) were monitored throughout the study. RESULTS: The results revealed that when compared to patients in the placebo arm, those in NVK and KSK arms showed a statistically significant reduction in hospital stay time, reduction in viral load of SARS-CoV-2, and the time taken to become symptomatic from asymptomatic. Out of 125 COVID-19 patients recruited, 120 completed the study; two from the placebo group developed severe symptoms and were shifted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and three patients from Arms II and III withdrew from the study. The mean age of females (n=60) and males (n=60) enrolled was between 40.2 and 44.3 years, respectively. Results were more promising for all the patients in NVK and KSK arms as all enrolled participants (100%) under this group got discharged by day 6 as compared to only 42.5% (n=17) from the placebo group on that day. The hospital stay time for patients in Arm I was significantly longer (mean [SD]=8.4 [2.0] days) as compared to the Arms II and III (mean [SD]=4.7 [1.5] and 4.2 [1.5] days, respectively (Kruskal-Wallis test, P=0.0001). Patients in the three groups took a significantly different number of days to become asymptomatic. While Arm II and III patients took mean of 2.5 and 1.7 days, respectively, Arm I, patients took a mean of 4.2 days (Kruskal-Wallis test, P=0.0001). In all, two adverse events were recorded, one for vomiting and one for diarrhea lasting a day in Arm I and Arm II, respectively. The mean value of interleukin-6 (IL6) was significantly different in comparison to the placebo-decaffeinated tea arm (NVK=2.6 and KSK=2.2, placebo=4.0, P=0.02). The other blood biochemical parameters like C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), ferritin, and D-dimer that were analyzed at the baseline and at the time of discharge from the hospital, were not significantly different in the three arms. CONCLUSION: NVK and KSK arms showed a statistically significant reduction in hospital stay time, reduction in viral load of SARS-CoV-2, and time taken for patients to become asymptomatic from symptomatic, when compared to the placebo (decaffeinated tea). The primary outcome measures of the KSK arm were significantly better than those in the NVK arm.","Srivastava, Anurag; Rengaraju, Manickavasagam; Srivastava, Saurabh; Narayanan, Vimal; Gupta, Vivek; Upadhayay, Rashmi; Kumar, Jitender; Parameswaran, Sathiyarajeswaran; KanakavalliKadarkarai; AarthiVelmurugan",Trials,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34454572/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13063-021-05478-0,476

605236,The role of green roofs in post COVID-19 confinement: An analysis of willingness to pay,2021-10-01,"Abstract Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a major cause of lower respiratory infection in young children. Repeated infections occur throughout life, but its immune evasion mechanisms are largely unknown. We recently found that hMPV M2-2 protein elicits immune evasion by targeting mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), an antiviral signaling molecule. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying such inhibition are not known. Our mutagenesis studies revealed that PDZ-binding motifs, 29-DEMI-32 and 39-KEALSDGI-46, located in an immune inhibitory region of M2-2, are responsible for M2-2-mediated immune evasion. We also found both motifs prevent TRAF5 and TRAF6, the MAVS downstream adaptors, to be recruited to MAVS, while the motif 39-KEALSDGI-46 also blocks TRAF3 migrating to MAVS. In parallel, these TRAFs are important in activating transcription factors NF-kB and/or IRF-3 by hMPV. Our findings collectively demonstrate that M2-2 uses its PDZ motifs to launch the hMPV immune evasion through blocking the interaction of MAVS and its downstream TRAFs.","Chen, Yu; Deng, Xiaoling; Deng, Junfang; Zhou, Jiehua; Ren, Yuping; Liu, Shengxuan; Prusak, Deborah J.; Wood, Thomas G.; Bao, Xiaoyong",Virology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682216302860; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682216302860; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2016.09.026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27743962/,476

Yet, the impact of the pandemic on people with severe mental illness, including bipolar disorder (BD), remains unclear, warranting scoping review on the matter. METHODS: The MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were systematically searched from inception up to April 24, 2021, adopting broad inclusion criteria to assess a variety of clinical and public health themes related to people with a primary diagnosis of BD during the COVID-19 pandemics. The present work complying with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR) registered in the Open Science Framework (OSF) repository (https://osf.io/7evpx/). RESULTS: Fourteen papers informed the present scoping review. Four major themes were identified: (i) impact of COVID-19-related stressors on BD; (ii) impact of COVID-19 on mental health service utilization among people with BD; (iii) impact of BD on the risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection; (iv) engagement in preventative behaviors among people with BD. Additional themes warranting further research were nonetheless detected. LIMITATIONS: Further original studies are needed. CONCLUSION: The present study confirmed the high-vulnerability hypothesis concerning people with BD versus the general population, reinforcing the need for further research related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional information is warranted to compare the impact of the pandemic period among BD people against pre-pandemic records, the general population, and other severe mental illnesses, namely people with schizophrenia or major depressive disorder, to inform the public health and the delivery of patient-tailored interventions.","Fornaro, Michele; De Prisco, Michele; Billeci, Martina; Ermini, Eleonora; Young, Allan H; Lafer, Beny; Soares, Jair C.; Vieta, Eduard; Quevedo, Joao; de Bartolomeis, Andrea; Sim, Kang; Yatham, Lakshmi N; Bauer, Michael; Stein, Dan J.; Solmi, Marco; Berk, Michael; Carvalho, Andre F.",J Affect Disord,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016503272100896X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.08.091; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016503272100896X?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34517248/,476
605716,The value of telemedicine for the pediatric surgery patient in the time of COVID-19 and beyond,2021-02-19,"Antibiotic misuse is greatly contributing to an increase in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in humans and animals. Natural and synthetic alternative strategies are being investigated in human and veterinary medicine, but little attention is paid to the antimicrobial effects of edible lipids, such as medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) and monoglycerides. Among MCFAs, lauric acid (LA) and its monoglyceride derivative, glycerol monolaurate (GML), exhibit the strongest antimicrobial activity. Coconut and palm kernel oils are considered the main sources of LA. On the other hand, some edible insects (e.g., Hermetia illucens) are gaining interest as novel feed ingredients, due to the high amount of LA they contain as well as their numerous bioactive components, which provide many additional benefits to animal health. Although the beneficial effect of both MCFAs and LA is gradually being recognized, their high content within insects and, consequently, their possible role as antimicrobials, has not been well-reported. This mini review focuses on the anti-infective effects of the insect-derived MCFAs LA and its derivatives. We emphasize the potential of insect lipids, compared to the other vegetable sources, in the current global scenario where a sustainable and circular economy is required. Finally, we critically discuss the use and the benefits of edible insects such as favorable options as feed and food from the perspective of animal and human nutrition.","Borrelli, Luca; Varriale, Lorena; Dipineto, Ludovico; Pace, Antonino; Menna, Lucia F.; Fioretti, Alessandro",Front Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2021.620798; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33717009/,476

In this work, we built a two‐row four‐seat setup and an air duct system to simulate a cabin environment. A thermal manikin on the rear left‐hand seat was taken as the infected passenger (IP) and “coughed” three times through a cough generator. The deposited viruses and droplets on nearby seats were measured by a cultivation method and microscope, respectively. The effects of seat backrest and overhead gasper jet were studied. Results showed that the number of deposited virus on the front seat was one order of magnitude higher than that on other seats which only contained droplets smaller than 10 µm in diameter. When the backrest was 15 cm higher than the cough, the deposited number of viruses was reduced to 5% of that with the backrest at the same height with the cough. The gasper jet above the IP with a velocity of 1.5 m/s can reduce the deposited viruses to 4% of that with gasper off. It indicates that both the gasper jet and backrest can work as mitigation measures to block the cough jet and protect the nearby passengers.","Wang, Cunteng; Xu, Jingcui; Fu, Sau Chung; Chan, Ka Chung; Chao, Christopher Y.

In the case of the S2 domain of protein S, it has been found a highly hydrophobic and interfacial domain flanked by the heptad repeat 1 and 2 regions; significantly, different peptides pertaining to this domain have shown a significant leakage effect and an important plaque formation inhibition, which, similarly to HIV-1 gp41, support the role of this region in the fusion process. Therefore, we have carried out a study of the binding and interaction with model membranes of a peptide corresponding to segment 1073–1095 of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein, peptide SARS(L) in the presence of different membrane model systems, as well as the structural changes taking place in both the lipid and the peptide induced by the binding of the peptide to the membrane. Our results show that SARS(L) strongly partitions into phospholipid membranes and organizes differently in lipid environments, displaying membrane activity modulated by the lipid composition of the membrane. These data would support its role in SARS-CoV mediated membrane fusion and suggest that the region where this peptide resides could be involved in the merging of the viral and target cell membranes.","Guillén, Jaime; De Almeida, Rodrigo F.

SARS-CoV-2 infects much more people, especially the elder population, around the world than other coronavirus, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which is challenging current global public health system. Beyond the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, microbial coinfection plays an important role in the occurrence and development of SARS-CoV-2 infection by raising the difficulties of diagnosis, treatment, prognosis of COVID-19, and even increasing the disease symptom and mortality. We summarize the coinfection of virus, bacteria and fungi with SARS-CoV-2, their effects on COVID-19, the reasons of coinfection, and the diagnosis to emphasize the importance of microbial coinfection in COVID-19. KEY POINTS: • Microbial coinfection is a nonnegligible factor in COVID-19. • Microbial coinfection exacerbates the processes of the occurrence, development and prognosis of COVID-19, and the difficulties of clinical diagnosis and treatment. • Different virus, bacteria, and fungi contributed to the coinfection with SARS-CoV-2.","Chen, Xi; Liao, Binyou; Cheng, Lei; Peng, Xian; Xu, Xin; Li, Yuqing; Hu, Tao; Li, Jiyao; Zhou, Xuedong; Ren, Biao",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-020-10814-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32780290/,476

609289,"Education Crisis, Workforce Preparedness, and COVID‐19: Reflections and Recommendations",2021-03-31,"The use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) and vaping among adolescents has risen exponentially in the last decade. E-cigarette flavors has driven adolescents to use these convenient, USB-like devices, designed to create a desired social image, while being seemingly unaware of the serious health consequences of their behavior. Vaping impacts protective pulmonary barriers by attenuating the mucociliary clearance and by increasing peribronchial inflammation and fibrosis. The recent SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has been characterized by a plethora of unusual disease presentations. Among them, a unique presentation seen exclusively in children and adolescents was multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). Seventy percent of adolescents who had MIS-C also had acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and we speculate that there may exist common denominator that links MIS-C and adolescents: the use of e-cigarettes. The virus targets the angiotensin converting receptor (ACE receptor), and studies have shown nicotine-based e-cigarettes or vaping cause oxidative stress and resulting in the upregulation of ACE2, which might worsen ARDS in MIS-C. Our mini-review highlights that adolescents using e-cigarette have alterations in their pulmonary defenses against SARS-CoV-2: an upregulation of the ACE2 receptors, the primary target of SARS-CoV-2. Their compromised immune system makes them more uniquely vulnerable to Covid-19 related MIS-C, increasing their risk for ARDS and related morbidities. Currently, studies have shown an association between MIS-C and vaping, we speculate that adolescents who vape/smoke might be especially vulnerable to serious respiratory symptoms if they develop a hyper-inflammatory state MIS-C.","Brar, Esha; Saxena, Anish; Dukler, Claudia; Xu, Fangxi; Saxena, Deepak; Cheema Brar, Preneet; Guo, Yuqi; Li, Xin",Front Pediatr,https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2021.647925; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34055688/,476

METHODS: A 1-y observational study was performed of neonates admitted to an NMCU in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Nasopharyngeal samples were collected for the detection of respiratory viruses and bacteria by real-time PCR (RT-PCR). Cycle threshold (Ct) values were provided to estimate viral load. Predictors for the presence of study pathogens were identified. RESULTS: From October 2010 through September 2011, 334 neonates (median age 1.3 d, 53.6% male) were included. Overall, 37 respiratory pathogens were detected in 34 children (10.2%): parainfluenza-1 (n = 9), human rhinovirus (n = 7), parainfluenza-3 (n = 6), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, n = 6), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 3), adenovirus (n = 2), human coronavirus (n = 2), influenza A (n = 1), and bocavirus (n = 1). Neonates with higher viral loads (Ct <35; n = 11) were more often clinically ill than those with lower viral loads (Ct ≥35; n = 23). Two variables significantly contributed to the detection of study pathogens: age (odds ratio (OR) 1.21 for each day older; 95% confidence interval 1.12–1.30) and rhinorrhea (OR 6.71; 95% confidence interval 1.54–29.21).

One of the baffling aspects of this pandemic is the asymmetric increase in cases and case fatality rate (CFR) among countries. We analyze the time series of the infection and fatality numbers and found two interesting aspects. Firstly, the rate of spread in a region is directly connected to the population density of the region where the virus is spreading. For example, the high rate of increase in cases in the United States of America (USA) is related to the high population density of New York City. This is shown by scaling the cumulative number of cases with a measure of the population density of the affected region in countries such as Italy, Spain, Germany, and the USA and we see that the curves are coinciding. Secondly, we analyzed the CFR number as a function of the number of days, since the first death, and we found that there are two clear categories among countries: one category with high CFR numbers (around 10%) and the other category with low CFR numbers (2% to 4%). When we analyzed the results, we see that countries with lower CFR numbers more or less tend to have implemented active control measures such as aggressive testing, tracking down possible infections, effective quarantine measures, etc. Moreover, we did not see any convincing correlation between mortality rates and the median age of the population.","Iype, Eldhose; Gulati, Sadhya",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.21.20073791; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.21.20073791v1?rss=1,476

Its potential for automation has caused it to be used as a presence/absence diagnostic tool even when RNA quantification is not required. This technology has been pushed to the forefront of public awareness by the COVID-19 pandemic, as its global application has enabled rapid and analytically sensitive mass testing, with the first assays targeting three viral genes published within days of the publication of the SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence. One of those, targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene, has been heavily criticised for supposed scientific flaws at the molecular and methodological level, and this criticism has been extrapolated to doubts about the validity of RT-qPCR for COVID-19 testing in general. We have analysed this assay in detail, and our findings reveal some limitations but also highlight the robustness of the RT-qPCR methodology for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Nevertheless, whilst our data show that some errors can be tolerated, it is always prudent to confirm that the primer and probe sequences complement their intended target, since, when errors do occur, they may result in a reduction in the analytical sensitivity. However, in this case, it is unlikely that a mismatch will result in poor specificity or a significant number of false-positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnoses, especially as this is routinely checked by diagnostic laboratories as part of their quality assurance.","Bustin, Stephen; Kirvell, Sara; Huggett, Jim F.; Nolan, Tania",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34445406/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22168702,476

The aim of the study was to describe the clinical features of hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19 and to determine the prognostic factors associated with in-hospital mortality. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study among adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to Hospital Cayetano Heredia; a tertiary care hospital in Lima, Peru. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression was used to identify factors independently associated with in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: A total of 369 patients (median age 59 years [IQR:49–68]; 241 (65.31%) male) were included. Most patients (68.56%) reported at least one comorbidity; more frequently: obesity (42.55%), diabetes mellitus (21.95%), and hypertension (21.68%). The median duration of symptoms prior to hospital admission was 7 days (IQR: 5–10). Reported in-hospital mortality was 49.59%. By multiple Cox regression, oxygen saturation (SaO(2)) values of less than 90% on admission correlated with mortality, presenting 1.86 (95%CI: 1.02–3.39), 4.44 (95%CI: 2.46–8.02) and 7.74 (95%CI: 4.54–13.19) times greater risk of death for SaO(2) of 89–85%, 84–80% and <80%, respectively, when compared to patients with SaO(2) >90%. Additionally, age >60 years was associated with 1.88 times greater mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Oxygen saturation below 90% on admission is a strong predictor of in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19.

Thereafter, a global logarithmic expansion of the cases has occurred. Some countries have a higher rate of infections despite of early implementation of quarantine. Air pollution could be related to the high susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 and the associated case-fatality rates (deaths/cases*100). Lima, Peru has the second highest incidence of COVID-19 in Latin America and it is also one of the cities with highest levels of air pollution in the Region. METHODS: This study investigated the association of the levels of PM(2.5) exposure in the previous years (2010–2016) in 24 districts of Lima with the cases, deaths and case-fatality rates of COVID-19. RESULTS: Until June 12, 2020, there were 6,308 deaths and 220,749 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases in Peru. In Lima, the total number of COVID-19 deaths in all metropolitan areas was 2,382. The case-fatality rate at the national level was 2.58% and 1.93% in Lima. Higher PM(2.5) levels are associated with higher number of cases and deaths of COVID-19. The case-fatality rate (Deaths/cases*100) did not increase with the increase in PM(2.5) levels. A higher number of food markets was associated with higher incidence and mortality of COVID-19 (p < 0.01 for both); these associations persisted when cases (r = 0.49; p < 0.01) and deaths (r = 0.58; p < 0.01) were adjusted by the population density. The association of PM(2.5) with cases of COVID-19 was maintained after controlling analysis by age, sex and number of food markers. CONCLUSIONS: the higher rates of COVID-19 in Metropolitan Lima is attributable, among others, to the increased PM(2.5) exposure in the previous years after adjusting for age, sex and number of food markets. Reduction of air pollution since a long term perspective, and social distancing are needed to prevent spreads of virus outbreak.","Vasquez-Apestegui, Vanessa; Parras-Garrido, Enrique; Tapia, Vilma; Paz-Aparicio, Valeria M.; Rojas, Jhojan P.; Sánchez-Ccoyllo, Odón R.; Gonzales, Gustavo F.",Res Sq,https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-39404/v1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32702735/,476

Consequently the World Health Organization has designated respiratory viral infections as a priority for vaccine development. Despite enormous advances in understanding the attributes of a protective mucosal antiviral immune response, current vaccines continue to fail in effectively generating long-lived protective CD8(+) T-cell immunity. To date, the majority of licensed human vaccines afford protection against infectious pathogens through the generation of specific immunoglobulin responses. In recent years, the selective manipulation of specific costimulatory pathways, which are critical in regulating T-cell-mediated immune responses, has generated increasing interest. Impressive results in animal models have shown that the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family member OX40 (CD134) and its binding partner OX40L (CD252) are key costimulatory molecules involved in the generation of protective CD8(+) T-cell responses at mucosal surfaces such as the lung. In this review, we highlight these new findings with a particular emphasis on their potential as immunological adjuvants to enhance poxvirus-based CD8(+) T-cell vaccines.","Goulding, John; Tahiliani, Vikas; Salek-Ardakani, Shahram",Immunological Reviews,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22017437/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3422077?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-065x.2011.01062.x,476

612893,Assessing Differential Impacts of COVID-19 on Black Communities,2020-05-14,"The global lockdown to mitigate COVID-19 pandemic health risks has altered human interactions with nature. Here, we report immediate impacts of changes in human activities on wildlife and environmental threats during the early lockdown months of 2020, based on 877 qualitative reports and 332 quantitative assessments from 89 different studies. Hundreds of reports of unusual species observations from around the world suggest that animals quickly responded to the reductions in human presence. However, negative effects of lockdown on conservation also emerged, as confinement resulted in some park officials being unable to perform conservation, restoration and enforcement tasks, resulting in local increases in illegal activities such as hunting. Overall, there is a complex mixture of positive and negative effects of the pandemic lockdown on nature, all of which have the potential to lead to cascading responses which in turn impact wildlife and nature conservation. While the net effect of the lockdown will need to be assessed over years as data becomes available and persistent effects emerge, immediate responses were detected across the world. Thus initial qualitative and quantitative data arising from this serendipitous global quasi-experimental perturbation highlights the dual role that humans play in threatening and protecting species and ecosystems. Pathways to favorably tilt this delicate balance include reducing impacts and increasing conservation effectiveness.","Bates, Amanda E.; Primack, Richard B.; Duarte, Carlos M.",Biol Conserv,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320721002275?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34035536/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2021.109175; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006320721002275,476
613247,Summary of the proceedings of the International Forum 2020: “Radiologists fighting COVID-19: a united response to a global crisis”,2021-02-17,"Background. Novel coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19) is associated with significant cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, there have been very few reports on complete heart block (CHB) associated with COVID-19. This case series describes clinical characteristics, potential mechanisms, and short-term outcomes of critically ill COVID-19 patients complicated by CHB. Case Summary. We present three cases of new-onset CHB in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Patient 1 is a 41-year-old male with well-documented history of Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) who required mechanical ventilator support for acute hypoxic respiratory failure from severe COVID-19 pneumonia. He developed new-onset CHB without a hemodynamic derangement but subsequently had acute coronary syndrome complicated by cardiogenic shock. Patient 2 is a 77-year-old male with no past medical history who required intubation for severe COVID-19 pneumonia acute hypoxic respiratory failure. He developed CHB with sinus pause requiring temporary pacing but subsequently developed multiorgan failure. Patient 3 is 36-year-old lady 38 + 2 weeks pregnant, gravida 2 para 1 with no other medical history, who had an emergency Lower Section Caesarean Section (LSCS) as she required intubation for acute hypoxic respiratory failure. She exhibited new-onset CHB without hemodynamic compromise. The CHB resolved spontaneously after 24 hours. Discussion. COVID-19-associated CHB is a very rare clinical manifestation. The potential mechanisms for CHB in patients with COVID-19 include myocardial inflammation or direct viral infiltration as well as other causes such as metabolic derangements or use of sedatives. Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 should be monitored closely for the development of bradyarrhythmia and hemodynamic instability.","Ahmad, Farook; Gandre, Priti; Nguekam, Julien; Wall, Alanna; Ong, ShiYu; Karuppamakkantakath, Abdul N.; Tasopoulos, Konstantinos; Sadiq, Muhammad Athar; Kasim, Sazzli; Cuesta, Jeronimo M.",Case Rep Crit Care,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/9955466; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34422417/,476
613923,Anti-pan-neurofascin IgM in COVID-19-related Guillain-Barré syndrome: evidence for a nodo-paranodopathy,2020-10-08,"BACKGROUND: The relationships between human population movement (HPM) and health are a concern at global level. In the case of malaria, those links are crucial in relation to the spread of drug resistant parasites and to the elimination of malaria in the Greater Mekong sub-Region (GMS) and beyond. The mobile and migrant populations (MMP) who are involved in forest related activities are both at high risk of being infected with malaria and at risk of receiving late and sub-standard treatment due to poor access to health services. In Cambodia, in 2012, the National Malaria Control Programme (NMCP) identified, as a key objective, the development of a specific strategy for MMPs in order to address these challenges. A population movement framework (PMF) for malaria was developed and operationalized in order to contribute to this strategy. METHODS: A review of the published and unpublished literature was conducted. Based on a synthesis of the results, information was presented and discussed with experienced researchers and programme managers in the Cambodian NMCP and led to the development and refinement of a PMF for malaria. The framework was “tested” for face and content validity with national experts through a workshop approach. RESULTS: In the literature, HPM has been described using various spatial and temporal dimensions both in the context of the spread of anti-malarial drug resistance, and in the context of malaria elimination and previous classifications have categorized MMPs in Cambodia and the GMS through using a number of different criteria. Building on these previous models, the PMF was developed and then refined and populated with in-depth information relevant to Cambodia collected from social science research and field experiences in Cambodia. The framework comprises of the PMF itself, MMP activity profiles and a Malaria Risk Index which is a summation of three related indices: a vulnerability index, an exposure index and an access index which allow a qualitative ranking of malaria risk in the MMP population. Application of currently available data to the framework illustrates that the highest risk population are those highly mobile populations engaged in forest work. CONCLUSION: This paper describes the process of defining MMPs in Cambodia, identifying the different activities and related risks to appropriately target and tailor interventions to the highest risk groups. The framework has been used to develop more targeted behaviour change and outreach interventions for MMPs in Cambodia and its utility and effectiveness will be evaluated as part of those interventions.","Guyant, Philippe; Canavati, Sara E; Chea, Nguon; Ly, Po; Whittaker, Maxine Anne; Roca-Feltrer, Arantxa; Yeung, Shunmay",Malar J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26088924/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12936-015-0773-5,476

The health benefits are strain specific and could be due to the produced polysaccharides. The consumption of probiotics may prevent obesity, irritable bowel syndrome, eczema or atopic dermatitis, and asthma. Non-replicative strains of Bifidobacterium longum (NCC3001 and NCC2705) promote the differentiation of normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs), inducing a high expression of differentiation markers (keratin —KRT1—, and transglutaminase —TGM1—) and pro-regeneration markers (cathepsins), including β-defensin-1, which plays an important role in modulating the cutaneous immune response. Strains belonging to the genera Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus can increase tight-junction proteins in NHEKs and enhance barrier function. Bifidobacteria and lactobacilli may be used as prophylactic or therapeutic agents towards enteric pathogens, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, lactose intolerance, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, colorectal cancer, cholesterol reduction, and control of obesity and metabolic disorders. Bifidobacterium bifidum showed an in vitro capability of lowering cholesterol levels thanks to its absorption into the bacterial membrane. Several strains of the species Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, L. casei, and L. gasseri led to a reduced amount of serum cholesterol due to their ability to assimilate cholesterol (in vitro). Lactococcus lactis KF147 and Lactobacillus plantarum Lp81 have also been shown to reduce cholesterol levels by 12%. Clarifying the specific health mechanisms of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus strains in preventing high-cost pathologies could be useful for delineating effective guidelines for the treatment of infants and adults.","Marras, Luisa; Caputo, Michele; Bisicchia, Sonia; Soato, Matteo; Bertolino, Giacomo; Vaccaro, Susanna; Inturri, Rosanna",Microorganisms,https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms9040836; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33919907/,476

In this work, we aimed to assess the maintenance of immunological memory to SARS‐CoV‐2. METHODS: We evaluated the long‐term virus‐specific cellular and humoral immune response in the members of an Italian Serie A football team, who experienced a cluster of COVID‐19 in March 2020, which was strictly evaluated in the following months. RESULTS: Our results highlight a heterogeneous magnitude of immunological memory at 5 months after infection. Indeed, 20% of the subjects displayed a weak cellular and humoral memory to SARS‐CoV‐2, suggesting that they may be at higher risk of reinfection. In addition, a history of symptomatic COVID‐19 was associated with higher levels of SARS‐CoV‐2‐reactive CD4(+) T cells and specific antibody levels than in asymptomatic individuals. CONCLUSION: Collectively, these data demonstrate that immunity to SARS‐CoV‐2 is maintained five months postinfection even if the magnitude of response is heterogeneous among individuals. This finding suggests that some COVID‐19‐recovered subjects may benefit from vaccination.","Mazzoni, Alessio; Maggi, Laura; Capone, Manuela; Vanni, Anna; Spinicci, Michele; Salvati, Lorenzo; Tekle Kiros, Seble; Semeraro, Roberto; Pengue, Luca; Colao, Maria Grazia; Magi, Alberto; Rossolini, Gian Maria; Liotta, Francesco; Cosmi, Lorenzo; Bartoloni, Alessandro; Annunziato, Francesco",Clin Transl Immunology,https://doi.org/10.1002/cti2.1281; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33976879/,476

COVID-19 vaccines have become the new hope for stemming the pandemic. We aimed to assess pre-launch vaccine acceptance among hospital workers in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes Administrative Region of France. Methods. We performed a cross sectional study involving all hospital workers in 11 Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes hospitals in December 2020. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify factors associated with vaccine hesitancy. Results. We analyzed completed questionnaires from 1,964 respondents (78% women, mean age 42 years, 21.5% physicians, 41% private care centers). A total of 1,048 (53%) hospital workers were in favor of COVID-19 vaccination. Vaccine hesitancy was associated with: female gender; young age; paramedical, technical, and administrative professions (i.e., all non-medical professions); no prior flu vaccination; and employment in the private medical care sector (p<0.05). Distrust of health authorities and pharmaceutical lobbying were the main obstacles to vaccination. Inversely, creating herd immunity and protecting patients and household members were the most frequently cited reasons in favor of vaccination. More than two-thirds of participants feared that the clinical and biological research was too rapid and worried about serious adverse effects. Most participants were interested in written information on the available vaccines, but the most vaccine-hesitant categories preferred oral information. Only 35% supported mandatory vaccination (Figure 1). Conclusions. Targeted written and oral information campaigns will be necessary to improve vaccination coverage among hospital workers who show a surprisingly high hesitancy rate. Imposing mandatory vaccination could be counterproductive.","Navarre, C; Roy, P; Ledochowski, S; Fabre, M; Esparcieux, A; Issartel, B; Dutertre, M; Blanc-Gruyelle, A-L; Suy, F; Adelaide, L; Pariset, C; Kisterman, JP; Champagne, H; Saison, J",Infect Dis Now,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34492344/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idnow.2021.08.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666991921004887?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666991921004887,476

CLEC4M was previously reported to capture artificial HCVpp (pseudoparticle) and transmit it to hepatocytes (transinfection) via CLEC4M-positive cells. It is still not known whether CLEC4M acts as a receptor for HCVcc (cell-culture-produced HCV) transinfection or whether CLEC4M is an entry receptor for HCVcc. Initially, we established stably CLEC4M-positive and HCV-replication-permissive cell lines by introducing a CLEC4M expression vector into Huh7-25 cells (Huh7-25-CLEC4M) by transfection. Huh7-25 is a mutant cell line that is resistant to JFH-1 HCVcc due to the lack of expression of CD81 but permissive for replication of JFH1 HCV RNA. When Huh7-25-CLEC4M cells were infected with HCVcc and cultured for 6 days, none were positive for infection. Next, to examine whether CLEC4M functions as a receptor for transinfection, Huh7-25-CLEC4M cells were inoculated with HCVcc and thereafter co-cultured with Huh7-it cells, which are susceptible to HCV infection. The amount of HCV RNA was increased in Huh7-it cells co-cultured with Huh7-25-CLEC4M cells, and the transinfection was inhibited in the presence of anti-CLEC4M antibody during inoculation. Thus, CLEC4M cannot substitute for CD81 as an entry receptor for JFH-1 HCVcc. It just mediates transinfection without internalization of HCVcc. CD81 is still crucial for HCV entry into hepatocytes, and CLEC4M in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells may be responsible for hepatotropism of HCV infection by trapping circulating HCV to transmit it to adjacent hepatocytes.

METHODS: Sensitivity and dynamic trend to seropositivity were evaluated in 233 samples from 114 patients with moderate, severe or critical COVID-19 confirmed with PCR on nasopharyngeal swab. Specificity was evaluated in 113 samples collected before January 2020, including 24 samples from patients with non-SARS coronavirus infection. RESULTS: Sensitivity for all assays was 100% (95% confidence interval 83.7–100) 3 weeks after onset of symptoms. Specificity varied between 94.7% (88.7–97.8) and 100% (96.1–100). Calculated at the cut-offs that corresponded to a specificity of 95% and 97.5%, Roche had the highest sensitivity (85.0% (79.8–89.0) and 81.1% (76.6–85.7), p < 0.05 except vs. Abbott). Seroconversion occurred on average 2 days earlier for Roche total Ig anti-N and the three IgG anti-N assays (Abbott, Mikrogen, Euroimmun) than for the two IgG anti-S assays (Diasorin, Euroimmun) (≥50% seroconversion day 9–10 vs. day 11–12 and p < 0.05 for percent seropositive patients day 9–10 to 17–18). There was no significant difference in the IgG antibody time to seroconversion between critical and non-critical patients. DISCUSSION: Seroconversion occurred within 3 weeks after onset of symptoms with all assays and on average 2 days earlier for assays detecting IgG or total Ig anti-N than for IgG anti-S. The specificity of assays detecting anti-N was comparable to anti-S and excellent in a challenging control population.","Van Elslande, Jan; Decru, Bram; Jonckheere, Stijn; Van Wijngaerden, Eric; Houben, Els; Vandecandelaere, Patricia; Indevuyst, Christophe; Depypere, Melissa; Desmet, Stefanie; André, Emmanuel; Van Ranst, Marc; Lagrou, Katrien; Vermeersch, Pieter",Clin Microbiol Infect,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2020.07.038; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X20304468; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X20304468; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32745595/,476

Both Hp1036 and Hp1239 peptides exhibited potent virucidal activities against HSV-1 (EC(50) = 0.43 ± 0.09 and 0.41 ± 0.06 μM, respectively) and effective inhibitory effects when added at the viral attachment (EC(50) = 2.87 ± 0.16 and 5.73 ± 0.61 μM, respectively), entry (EC(50) = 4.29 ± 0.35 and 4.32 ± 0.47 μM, respectively) and postentry (EC(50) = 7.86 ± 0.80 and 8.41 ± 0.73 μM, respectively) steps. Both Hp1036 and Hp1239 peptides adopted α-helix structure in approximate membrane environment and resulted in the destruction of the viral morphology. Moreover, Hp1036 and Hp1239 peptides entered Vero cells and reduced the intracellular viral infectivity.

The INDSCI-SIM model is a 9-component, age-stratified, contact-structured compartmental model for COVID-19 spread in India. We use INDSCI-SIM, together with Bayesian methods, to obtain optimal fits to reported cases and deaths across the span of the first wave of the Indian pandemic, over the period Jan 30, 2020 to Feb 15, 2021. We account for lock-downs and other non-pharmaceutical interventions, an overall increase in testing as a function of time, the under-counting of cases and deaths, and a range of age-specific infection-fatality ratios. We first use our model to describe data from all individual districts of the state of Karnataka, benchmarking our calculations using data from serological surveys. We then extend this approach to aggregated data for Karnataka state. We model the progress of the pandemic across the cities of Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Bengaluru and Chennai, and then for India as a whole. We estimate that deaths were undercounted by a factor between 2 and 5 across the span of the first wave, converging on 2.2 as a representative multiplier that accounts for the urban-rural gradient across the country. We also estimate an overall under-counting of cases by a factor of between 20 and 25 towards the end of the first wave. Our estimates of the infection fatality ratio (IFR) are in the range 0.05 - 0.15, broadly consistent with previous estimates but substantially lower than values that have been estimated for other LMIC countries.

Visitors to African, Asian, or South American destinations, typically characterized by harsh environmental conditions and poor sanitation standards, are at risk of exposure to a large number of pathogens causing infectious diseases. The infections are transmitted from contaminated food and water, through the air, direct contact, or by insects. The main modes of RTIs transmission include droplet infection and direct contact. The clinical spectrum of RTIs in travelers is broad, from upper respiratory tract infections, pharyngitis, bronchitis, pneumonia, to influenza-like illness. The spectrum of microbial agents causing respiratory infections include numerous viruses and bacteria, rarely fungi, and parasites. Most travelers complain of mild infections, only a small minority seek medical assistance and report to health care facilities. Because of the risk of importing pathogens into Europe or North America and transferring them onto the local population, it is important to present the scale of the problem in relation to rapid development of tourism industry and an increasing number of intercontinental journeys. The aim of the study was to discuss the occurrence of travel-related respiratory infections among representatives of temperate climate traveling to and returning from the tropics.","Korzeniewski, Krzysztof; Nitsch-Osuch, Aneta; Lass, Anna; Guzek, Aneta",Environmental Biomedicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25381557/; https://doi.org/10.1007/5584_2014_89,476

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) program brings together data from 72 ongoing maternal–child cohort studies – involving more than 50,000 children and over 1200 investigators – to conduct transdisciplinary solution-oriented research that addresses how early environmental exposures influence child health. ECHO uses a multi-team system approach to consortium-wide data collection and analysis to generate original research that informs programs, policies, and practices to enhance children’s health. Here, we share two conceptual models informed by ECHO’s experiences and the Science of Team Science. The first conceptual model illuminates a system of teams and associated tasks that support collaboration toward shared scientific goals. The second conceptual model provides a framework for designing evaluations for continuous quality improvement of manuscript writing teams. Together, the two conceptual models offer guidance for the design, implementation, and evaluation of translational and transdisciplinary multi-team research initiatives.","Thompson, Leslie C.; Hall, Kara L.; Vogel, Amanda L.; Park, Christina H.; Gillman, Matthew W.",Journal of clinical and translational science,https://doi.org/10.1017/cts.2021.802; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34367683/,476
619764,COVID-19 Epidemic Outside China: 34 Founders and Exponential Growth,2020-03-03,"Anurans (frogs and toads) are among the most globally threatened taxonomic groups. Successful conservation of anurans will rely on improved data on the status and changes in local populations, particularly for rare and threatened species. Automated sensors, such as acoustic recorders, have the potential to provide such data by massively increasing the spatial and temporal scale of population sampling efforts. Analyzing such data sets will require robust and efficient tools that can automatically identify the presence of a species in audio recordings. Like bats and birds, many anuran species produce distinct vocalizations that can be captured by autonomous acoustic recorders and represent excellent candidates for automated recognition. However, in contrast to birds and bats, effective automated acoustic recognition tools for anurans are not yet widely available. An effective automated call recognition method for anurans must be robust to the challenges of real-world field data and should not require extensive labeled data sets. Here, we present the repeat interval-based bioacoustic identification tool (RIBBIT), which classifies anuran vocalizations in audio recordings based on their periodic structure. We apply this tool to field recordings to study two species, the boreal chorus frog (Pseudacris maculata) of temperate North American grasslands and the critically endangered variable harlequin frog (Atelopus varius) of tropical Central American rainforests. We show that RIBBIT can accurately identify boreal chorus frogs, even when they vocalize in heavily overlapping choruses, and can identify variable harlequin frog vocalizations at a field site where it has been very rarely encountered in visual surveys. Using relatively few simple parameters, RIBBIT can detect any vocalization with a periodic structure, including those of many anurans, insects, birds, and mammals. We provide open-source implementations of RIBBIT in Python and R to support its use for other taxa and communities.

MM manifestations are usually identified through hyperCalcemia, Renal failure, Anaemia, and lytic Bone lesions (CRAB). In particular, the extent of the bone disease is negatively related to a decreased quality of life in patients and, in general, bone disease in MM increases both morbidity and mortality. The detection of lytic bone lesions on imaging, especially computerized tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), is becoming crucial from the clinical viewpoint to separate asymptomatic from symptomatic MM patients and the detection of focal lytic lesions in these imaging data is becoming relevant even when no clinical symptoms are present. Therefore, radiology is pivotal in the staging and accurate management of patients with MM even in early phases of the disease. In this review, we describe the opportunities offered by quantitative imaging and radiomics in multiple myeloma. At the present time there is still high variability in the choice between various imaging methods to study MM patients and high variability in image interpretation with suboptimal agreement among readers even in tertiary centers. Therefore, the potential of medical imaging for patients affected by MM is still to be completely unveiled. In the coming years, new insights to study MM with medical imaging will derive from artificial intelligence (AI) and radiomics usage in different bone lesions and from the wide implementations of quantitative methods to report CT and MRI. Eventually, medical imaging data can be integrated with the patient’s outcomes with the purpose of finding radiological biomarkers for predicting the prognostic flow and therapeutic response of the disease.","Tagliafico, Alberto Stefano; Dominietto, Alida; Belgioia, Liliana; Campi, Cristina; Schenone, Daniela; Piana, Michele",Medicina (Kaunas),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33494449/; https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina57020094,476

As abnormal cortisol levels can induce various adverse effects, screening cortisol and cortisol analogues is important for monitoring stress levels and for identifying drug candidates. A novel cell-based sensing system was adopted for rapid screening of cortisol and its functional analogues under complex cellular regulation. We used glucocorticoid receptor (GR) fused to a split intein which reconstituted with the counterpart to trigger conditional protein splicing (CPS) in the presence of targets. CPS generates functional signal peptides which promptly translocate the fluorescent cargo. The sensor cells exhibited exceptional performance in discriminating between the functional and structural analogues of cortisol with improved sensitivity. Essential oil extracts with stress relief activity were screened using the sensor cells to identify GR effectors. The sensor cells responded to peppermint oil, and L-limonene and L-menthol were identified as potential GR effectors from the major components of peppermint oil. Further analysis indicated L-limonene as a selective GR agonist (SEGRA) which is a potential anti-inflammatory agent as it attenuates proinflammatory responses without causing notable adverse effects of GR agonists.","Ryu, Jeahee; Lee, Euiyeon; Kang, Chungwon; Lee, Minhyeong; Kim, Soyoun; Park, Seungil; Lee, Daeyeon; Kwon, Youngeun",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33947115/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22094747,476

As a result of the pandemic, a computer-based case simulation OSCE (CCS-OSCE) has been designed. The objective of this article is to describe the creation, administration, and development of the test. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This work is a descriptive study of the CCS-OSCE from its planning stages in April 2020 to its administration in June 2020. RESULTS: The CCS-OSCE evaluated the competences of anamnesis, exploration, clinical judgment, ethical aspects, interprofessional relations, prevention, and health promotion. No technical or communication skills were evaluated. The CCS-OSCE consisted of ten test sections, each of which had a 12-min time limit and ranged from six to 21 questions (mean: 1.1 min/question). The CCS-OSCE used the virtual campus platform of each of the 16 participating medical schools, which had a total of 2829 students in their sixth year of study.

Methods: Using publicly available data from South Korea, daily new COVID-19 cases were fitted with generalized additive models, assuming Poisson and negative binomial distributions. Epidemic dynamics by age and gender groups were explored with interactions between smoothed time terms and age and gender. Results: A negative binomial distribution fitted the daily case counts best. Interaction between the dynamic patterns of daily new cases and age groups was statistically significant (p<0.001), but not with gender group. People aged 20-39 years led the epidemic processes in the society with two peaks: one major peak around March 1 and a smaller peak around April 7, 2020. The epidemic process among people aged 60 or above was trailing behind that of younger people with smaller magnitude. After March 15, there was a consistent decline of daily new cases among elderly people, despite large fluctuations of case counts among young adults.

621929,COVID-19 impacts equine welfare: Policy implications for laminitis and obesity,2021-05-28,"BACKGROUND: With COVID-19 still in its pandemic stage, extensive research has generated increasing amounts of data and knowledge. As many studies are published within a short span of time, we often lose an integrative and comprehensive picture of host-coronavirus interaction (HCI) mechanisms. As of early April 2021, the ImmPort database has stored 7 studies (with 6 having details) that cover topics including molecular immune signatures, epitopes, and sex differences in terms of mortality in COVID-19 patients. The Coronavirus Infectious Disease Ontology (CIDO) represents basic HCI information. We hypothesize that the CIDO can be used as the platform to represent newly recorded information from ImmPort leading the reinforcement of CIDO. METHODS: The CIDO was used as the semantic platform for logically modeling and representing newly identified knowledge reported in the 6 ImmPort studies. A recursive eXtensible Ontology Development (XOD) strategy was established to support the CIDO representation and enhancement. Secondary data analysis was also performed to analyze different aspects of the HCI from these ImmPort studies and other related literature reports. RESULTS: The topics covered by the 6 ImmPort papers were identified to overlap with existing CIDO representation. SARS-CoV-2 viral S protein related HCI knowledge was emphasized for CIDO modeling, including its binding with ACE2, mutations causing different variants, and epitope homology by comparison with other coronavirus S proteins. Different types of cytokine signatures were also identified and added to CIDO. Our secondary analysis of two cohort COVID-19 studies with cytokine panel detection found that a total of 11 cytokines were up-regulated in female patients after infection and 8 cytokines in male patients. These sex-specific gene responses were newly modeled and represented in CIDO. A new DL query was generated to demonstrate the benefits of such integrative ontology representation. Furthermore, IL-10 signaling pathway was found to be statistically significant for both male patients and female patients. CONCLUSION: Using the recursive XOD strategy, six new ImmPort COVID-19 studies were systematically reviewed, the results were modeled and represented in CIDO, leading to the enhancement of CIDO. The enhanced ontology and further seconary analysis supported more comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanism of host responses to COVID-19 infection.","Huffman, Anthony; Masci, Anna Maria; Zheng, Jie; Sanati, Nasim; Brunson, Timothy; Wu, Guanming; He, Yongqun",J Biomed Semantics,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13326-021-00250-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34454610/,476

However, the importance of pet animals in the epidemiology of this infection is unclear. This study reports on a first large‐scale serosurvey of SARS‐CoV‐2 infections in dogs and cats in Europe. From 26 February 2020, just one day after the first confirmed human case of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in Croatia, to 15 June 2020, dog and cat serum samples were collected from animals admitted to three veterinary facilities in Croatia. Additionally, on 25 May 2020, a total of 122 serum samples from employees of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine University of Zagreb were collected. Total of 656 dogs and 131 cat serum samples were tested using an in‐house microneutralisation test (MNT). Human serum samples, as well as 172 randomly selected, dog sera were tested using enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). ELISA‐positive human sera were subsequently tested using MNT. Neutralising antibodies were confirmed in 0.76% cats and 0.31% dogs. ELISA reactivity was recorded in 7.56% tested dog sera. On the other hand, 5.19% of administrative, basic and pre‐clinical sciences department personnel and 5.13% of animal health service providers and laboratory personnel tested ELISA positive. Neutralising antibodies were not confirmed in any of the human samples. In conclusion, seropositivity among pet animals in Croatia is low, especially when compared to results from China. A small number of seropositive animals with a low titre of neutralising antibodies suggest infections are rare and are following infections in the human population.

Initial imaging revealed COVID-19 pneumonia but no pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) on CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA). The patient subsequently developed respiratory failure and left foot ischaemia associated with a rising D-dimer. Repeat CTPA and lower limb CT angiography revealed simultaneous bilateral PTE, biventricular cardiac thrombi and bilateral lower limb arterial occlusions. This case highlights a broad range of vascular sequalae associated with COVID-19 and the fact that these can occur despite a combination of prophylactic and treatment dose anticoagulation.","Ferguson, Katie; Quail, Nathaniel; Kewin, Peter; Blyth, Kevin G",BMJ Case Rep,https://doi.org/10.1136/bcr-2020-237460; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32747597/,476

Using input‐output tables (EORA 2016), our contribution is threefold. First, building on Pahl et al. (2021), we conceptually revise the approaches to analyse input‐output relationships. We underline the difference between the bilateral flow of value added and trade and distinguish between the producers and consumers of value‐added. Second, we distinguish between the supply and demand channels through which these countries can be affected by the disruptions in GVCs. Third, we apply this empirical exercise on an understudied region, namely, the Mediterranean region that is characterized by its involvement in several trade agreements that might boost their integration into GVCs. Our main findings show that, first, most of the countries have relatively larger backward GVC linkages than forward ones. Second, in the Northern shore of the Mediterranean, Italy and France are net suppliers of value added since they produce more value‐added absorbed abroad than the foreign value‐added they consume. Third, our results highlight also the limited integration between Southern shore partners, whose integration is almost completely driven by linkages with Southern European developed countries.","Ayadi, Rym; Giovannetti, Giorgia; Marvasi, Enrico; Vannelli, Giulio; Zaki, Chahir",World Econ,https://doi.org/10.1111/twec.13156; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34226790/,476

We conducted an observational retrospective cohort study using Optum(R) de-identified COVID-19 electronic health records from the United States to characterize patients who received a SARS-CoV-2 viral or antibody test between February 20, 2020 and July 10, 2020. We assessed temporal trends in testing and positivity by demographic and clinical characteristics; evaluated concordance between viral and antibody tests; and identified factors associated with positivity via multivariable logistic regression. Results. Our study population included 891,754 patients. Overall positivity rate for SARS-CoV-2 was 9% and 12% for viral and antibody tests, respectively. Positivity rate was inversely associated with the number of individuals tested and decreased over time across regions and race/ethnicities. Among patients who received a viral test followed by an antibody test, concordance ranged from 90%-93% depending on the duration between the two tests which is notable given uncertainties related to specific viral and antibody test characteristics. The following factors increased the odds of viral and antibody positivity in multivariable models: male, Hispanic or non-Hispanic Black and Asian, uninsured or Medicaid insurance, Northeast residence, dementia, diabetes, and obesity. Charlson Comorbidity Index was negatively associated with test positivity. We identified symptoms that were positively associated with test positivity, as well as, commonly co-occurring symptoms / conditions. Pediatric patients had reduced odds of a positive viral test, but conversely had increased odds of a positive antibody test. Conclusions. This study identified sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 testing and positivity within routine clinical practice from the United States.","Lindsay, L.; Secrest, M.

Using effective S-protein inhibitors may reduce the virulence of the virus. Molecular docking was performed to evaluate the binding affinity of 97 phenolic compounds (phenolics) with the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein receptor-binding domain (RBD). Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was carried out to assess the stability of interactions between top-ranked compounds and S-protein RBD. Pharmacokinetics and toxicity of top-ranked inhibitors were also studied. Furthermore, the essential residues involved in ligand binding, based on the degree of each amino acid in the ligand-amino acid interaction (LAI) network for S-protein, were identified. Molecular docking and MD simulations were performed utilizing the AutoDock and Discovery Studio Client version, respectively. The LAI network was analyzed using the Cytoscape software. Pharmacokinetics and toxicity of top-ranked compounds were studied using bioinformatics webservers. It was estimated that nine of the studied phenolics can bind to the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein at the nanomolar scale with a considerable estimated energy of binding (∆G binding Keywords: COVID-19; drug; molecular docking; molecular dynamics; SARS-CoV-2; spike protein.","Moradkhani, Shirin; Farmani, Abbas; Saidijam, Massoud; Taherkhani, Amir",Acta Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34565157/; https://doi.org/10.4149/av_2021_308,476

The Infectious Diseases Isolation Unit (IDIU) admits first opinion, second opinion and referred patients with a confirmed infectious disease (ID) or a clinically suspected ID that is awaiting laboratory diagnosis. The primary aims of this study were to describe the annual number and characteristics of patients referred to the IDIU and identify the most frequent IDs in referred dogs and cats. A secondary aim was to investigate possible differences in the length of the hospitalisation and the clinical outcome among referred cases and those admitted to the IDIU after first and second opinion appointments. METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out on patients hospitalised at the unit over 5 years from 9th October 2013 to 31st December 2018. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 365 dogs and 515 cats to give a total of 880 patients hospitalised at the IDIU from October 2013 to December 2018. Among the 96 referred dogs, parvovirosis (37.7%) and leptospirosis (31.1%) were the most frequent IDs. Feline upper respiratory tract infection (38.2%) and feline leukaemia virus infections (36.4%) were the main causes in the 80 referred cats. Worrying noncompliance rates of dog (51.0%) and cat (52.5%) vaccination schedules were identified. The analysis of the length of hospitalisation in the three groups of patients was not statistically different. In both animal species there were statistically significant higher clinical discharge rates on the first opinion patients’ group in comparison to referred patients and the second opinion group. CONCLUSIONS: Parvovirosis and leptospirosis in dogs and upper respiratory disease and feline leukaemia virus infection in cats were the most common diagnoses for patients admitted to the IDIU, reinforcing the need for accurate vaccination. Discharge rates results pinpoint the need for timely accurate reference.","Paulo, Catarina; Machado, Inês; Carvalho, Helena; Gomes, Joana; Deodato Mota, Ana; Tavares, Luís; Almeida, Virgílio; Gil, Solange",Vet Rec Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33981439/; https://doi.org/10.1002/vro2.5,476

R(0) is a derivative of the following variables—the duration of infectivity after the patient gets infected, the likelihood of transmission of infection per contact between a susceptible person and an infectious individual, and the contact rate. R(0) is usually estimated retrospectively from serial epidemiological data or using theoretical mathematical models. Epidemiologists can calculate R(0) using contact-tracing data, the most common method is to use cumulative incidence data. When mathematical models are used, R(0) values are estimated using ordinary differential equations. R(0) of COVID-19 as initially estimated by the World Health Organization (WHO) was between 1.4 and 2.4.

Changing challenges, perspectives, and practices in a new research culture by transferring it into a local context, namely in Italy’s inner areas, whose communities had already endured the 2016–2017 seismic swarm. We will look into the issue pragmatically, because we think that in front of a COVID-19 induced fast-changing institutional environment, science and technology studies researchers have some ideas to offer. These days, we are learning important lessons in citizen science. Today, local administrators must equip themselves with the management of infrastructures (unimaginable before COVID-19) for enforcing social distance and tracking positive cases. One of the tasks that we wish to take up is determining the levels of societal readiness and the levels of integration in society of new technologies, products, and services. The pandemic requires social and cultural innovation policies that make communities ready to respond to catastrophic events on their territory—our case-study is Italy’s inner areas—through access to data, communities of practice, co-creation, reflection, and inclusion.

A major obstacle in studying large-scale networks is that their size tends to increase exponentially. In addition, access to large network databases is limited for security or physical connection reasons. In this paper, we propose a novel sampling method that works effectively for large-scale networks. The proposed approach makes multiple heterogeneous Markov chains by adjusting random-walk traits on the given network to explore the target space efficiently. This approach provides better unbiased sampling results with reduced asymptotic variance within reasonable execution time than previous random-walk-based sampling approaches. We perform various experiments on large networks databases obtained from synthesis to real–world applications. The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing network sampling methods.","Lee, Jaekoo; Yoon, MyungKeun; Noh, Song",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33803175/; https://doi.org/10.3390/s21051905,476

Since the first bacterial genomes were sequenced in 1995 there have been several attempts to infer prokaryote phylogeny from complete genomes. Most of them depend on sequence alignment directly or indirectly and, in some cases, need fine-tuning and adjustment. The composition vector method circumvents the ambiguity of choosing the genes for phylogenetic reconstruction and avoids the necessity of aligning sequences of essentially different length and gene content. This new method does not contain ‘free’ parameter and ‘fine-tuning’. A bootstrap test for a phylogenetic tree of 139 organisms has shown the stability of the branchings, which support the small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) tree of life in its overall structure and in many details. It may provide a quick reference in prokaryote phylogenetics whenever the proteome of an organism is available, a situation that will become commonplace in the near future.","Qi, Ji; Luo, Hong; Hao, Bailin",Nucleic Acids Research,https://academic.oup.com/nar/article-pdf/32/suppl_2/W45/6207498/gkh362.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15215347/,476

METHODS: This was an anonymous internet-based survey study of applicants to the FPMRS fellowships in the United States, conducted from July 21, 2020, to August 5, 2020. A 34-item questionnaire queried applicants on satisfaction with interviews, comfort with creating a rank list and time, and financial cost of interviews. Applicants were invited to complete the survey via standardized emails distributed via the REDCap secure database. RESULTS: Forty-two (56.7%) of 74 applicants completed the survey. The majority of respondents were somewhat satisfied or very satisfied (92.9%) with the virtual interview process and felt comfortable ranking the programs (83.3%). A total of 9.8% of respondents found virtual interviews somewhat or much better than in-person interviews with regards to being informative and helpful, whereas 61% found them to be about the same. A majority (75.6%) found virtual interviews somewhat or much less stressful compared with in-person interviews. The majority (97.5%) spent less than $2,000 during the application process compared with more than $4,000 (87.8%) that they had anticipated spending if the interviews were in person.

626659,Covid-19: Junior doctors write to young people to acknowledge vaccine concerns.,2021-08-06,"Background: While social assistance through the federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act provided expanded UI benefits during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic until July 2020, it is unclear whether social assistance was in subsequent months sufficient to meet everyday spending needs and to curb adverse sequelae of financial hardship. Among working-aged Americans with job-related income loss during the pandemic, this study explored the associations of financial hardship with mental health outcomes and food and housing insecurity after accounting for receipt of social assistance. Methods: Using multivariable logistic regression and pooled repeated cross-sectional individual-level data on working-aged adults from nationally-representative surveys administered from September to November 2020, this study investigated the relationships between financial hardship and depressive and anxiety symptoms, food insufficiency, and, among housing renters, the likelihood of being evicted, controlling for the receipt of social assistance and other demographic and socioeconomic factors. Results: Experiencing somewhat of a financial hardship (vs no hardship) was linked to approximately 3-4 times higher odds of depressive or anxiety symptoms and a likely eviction, and a 15 times higher odds of food insufficiency. Experiencing considerable financial hardship (vs no hardship) predicted a 6-fold higher odds of depressive or anxiety symptoms, a 24-fold higher odds of a likely eviction, and a more than 50-fold higher odds of food insufficiency (all P values <.001). Conclusions: Even after accounting for receipt of social assistance, working-aged adults experiencing financial hardship had markedly greater odds of anxiety or depressive symptoms, food insufficiency, and an anticipated housing eviction. Across outcomes, these relationships were stronger at each successively higher level of financial hardship, and more than offset any corresponding benefits from social assistance. Overall, the findings from the present study point to the urgent need for direct and sustained cash relief well in excess of current levels of social assistance, as well as the imperative of extending housing renter eviction protections among Americans.","Kim, D.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.24.20248835; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.24.20248835v1?rss=1,476

Data were from the nationwide COVID-19 Coping Study of US adults aged ≥55 in April and May 2020 (n = 6548). We used population-weighted multivariable-adjusted multi-nomial logistic regression models to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for the associations between mental health (of depression, anxiety, and loneliness, each) and self-reported increased alcohol consumption (vs. no change in consumption). One in ten adults (717/6548; 11%) reported an increase in their alcohol consumption in the past week compared to their usual pre-COVID-19 drinking. Mental health symptomatology was associated with increased drinking since the pandemic onset (depression: OR = 2.66, 95% CI: 1.99–3.56; anxiety: OR = 1.80, 95% CI: 1.34–2.42; loneliness: OR = 2.45, 95% CI: 1.83–3.28).

Despite coronavirus infections were involved in previous epidemic outbreaks, no antiviral agent was developed for specific treatment. As a consequence, since the beginning of this pandemic, both repositioned and experimental drugs were used to treat the infected patients without evidence of clinical efficacy. Just based on experience coming from the use of antiviral agents to treat other viruses (eg, lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir) and supposed antiviral or immunomodulatory activities of drugs with no approved antiviral indications (eg hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab), clinicians have faced the ongoing pandemic. Currently, after about 9 months from the COVID-19 spread, there is still no antiviral agent capable of ensuring the cure of this syndrome. Clinical trials are beginning to confirm the benefits of some drugs, while for other compounds, efficacy and safety have not yet been confirmed. Randomized clinical trials (RCT) have denied or downsized the beneficial effects attributed to certain molecules, such as aminoquinolines, largely used in clinical practice at the beginning of COVID-19 spread. Conversely, at the same time, they have provided evidence for unexpected effectiveness of other agents that have been underutilized, such as steroids, which were not used in SARS treatment because of the threatened effect on viral replication. Evidence deriving from pathologic studies have demonstrated that the prothrombotic effects of SARS-CoV-2 can be prevented by heparin prophylaxis, underlining the need for personalized treatment for patients with severe disease. The main aim of this review is to synthesize the available information and evidence on both repositioned and experimental drugs for the treatment of COVID-19, focusing on the need to exercise caution on the use of unproven medical therapies.","Pagliano, Pasquale; Scarpati, Giuliana; Sellitto, Carmine; Conti, Valeria; Spera, Anna Maria; Ascione, Tiziana; Piazza, Ornella; Filippelli, Amelia",J Exp Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33442304/; https://doi.org/10.2147/jep.s255209,476

Currently, to our knowledge, there is no effective pharmacologic prophylaxis for individuals at risk. Objective To evaluate the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in hospital-based HCWs with exposure to patients with COVID-19 using a pre-exposure prophylaxis strategy. Design, Setting, and Participants This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (the Prevention and Treatment of COVID-19 With Hydroxychloroquine Study) was conducted at 2 tertiary urban hospitals, with enrollment from April 9, 2020, to July 14, 2020; follow-up ended August 4, 2020. The trial randomized 132 full-time, hospital-based HCWs (physicians, nurses, certified nursing assistants, emergency technicians, and respiratory therapists), of whom 125 were initially asymptomatic and had negative results for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal swab. The trial was terminated early for futility before reaching a planned enrollment of 200 participants. Interventions Hydroxychloroquine, 600 mg, daily, or size-matched placebo taken orally for 8 weeks. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection as determined by a nasopharyngeal swab during the 8 weeks of treatment. Secondary outcomes included adverse effects, treatment discontinuation, presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, frequency of QTc prolongation, and clinical outcomes for SARS-CoV-2-positive participants. Results Of the 132 randomized participants (median age, 33 years [range, 20-66 years]; 91 women [69%]), 125 (94.7%) were evaluable for the primary outcome. There was no significant difference in infection rates in participants randomized to receive hydroxychloroquine compared with placebo (4 of 64 [6.3%] vs 4 of 61 [6.6%]; P > .99). Mild adverse events were more common in participants taking hydroxychloroquine compared with placebo (45% vs 26%; P = .04); rates of treatment discontinuation were similar in both arms (19% vs 16%; P = .81). The median change in QTc (baseline to 4-week evaluation) did not differ between arms (hydroxychloroquine: 4 milliseconds; 95% CI, -9 to 17; vs placebo: 3 milliseconds; 95% CI, -5 to 11; P = .98). Of the 8 participants with positive results for SARS-CoV-2 (6.4%), 6 developed viral symptoms; none required hospitalization, and all clinically recovered. Conclusions and Relevance In this randomized clinical trial, although limited by early termination, there was no clinical benefit of hydroxychloroquine administered daily for 8 weeks as pre-exposure prophylaxis in hospital-based HCWs exposed to patients with COVID-19.

627770,Variation in COVID-19 Resource Allocation Protocols and Potential Implementation in the Chicago Metropolitan Area.,2021-10-01,"Macro domain is a highly conserved protein domain found in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Macro domains are also encoded by a set of positive-strand RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm of animal cells, including coronaviruses and alphaviruses. The functions of the macro domain are poorly understood, but it has been suggested to be an ADP-ribose-binding module. We have here characterized three novel human macro domain proteins that were found to reside either in the cytoplasm and nucleus [macro domain protein 2 (MDO2) and ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein 2] or in mitochondria [macro domain protein 1 (MDO1)], and compared them with viral macro domains from Semliki Forest virus, hepatitis E virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and with a yeast macro protein, Poa1p. MDO2 specifically bound monomeric ADP-ribose with a high affinity (K(d) = 0.15 μM), but did not bind poly(ADP-ribose) efficiently. MDO2 also hydrolyzed ADP-ribose-1″ phosphate, resembling Poa1p in all these properties. Ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein 2 did not show affinity for ADP-ribose or its derivatives, but instead bound poly(A). MDO1 was generally active in these reactions, including poly(A) binding. Individual point mutations in MDO1 abolished monomeric ADP-ribose binding, but not poly(ADP-ribose) binding; in poly(ADP-ribose) binding assays, the monomer did not compete against polymer binding. The viral macro proteins bound poly(ADP-ribose) and poly(A), but had a low affinity for monomeric ADP-ribose. Thus, the viral proteins do not closely resemble any of the human proteins in their biochemical functions. The differential activity profiles of the human proteins implicate them in different cellular pathways, some of which may involve RNA rather than ADP-ribose derivatives.","Neuvonen, Maarit; Ahola, Tero",J Mol Biol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S002228360801334X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2008.10.045; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002228360801334X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18983849/,476
627822,Cholinergic and lipid mediators crosstalk in Covid-19 and the impact of glucocorticoid therapy,2021-01-09,"Background Since beginning of Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there were contradictions and speculations around vitamin D and COVID-19 relationship. Given that there is association between vitamin D deficiency and some diseases including cancer, autoimmune disease and some infectious diseases, COVID-19 higher incidence rate and mortality in vitamin D deficient population was not a surprise. Conversely, some research would argue this relationship. Considering these contradictions, the aim of this study was to determine the relationship between prognosis and vitamin D level in cases with COVID-19. Methods In this cross-sectional study, 329 confirmed cases of COVID-19 which admitted to Kamkar-ArabNia Hospital in Qom city, Iran from March to July 2020 were categorized into three groups according to vitamin D serum levels (ng/ml): sufficient (>30), insufficient (20-30) and deficient (<20). Prognosis was determined across the groups. Results There was significant difference in hospital stay between patients with sufficient and insufficient vitamin D levels (P = 0.007). Adjusting vitamin D levels for confounding variables, linear regression underscored significant differences in the association between length of hospitalization and lower vitamin D levels, with a longer stay noted in insufficient groups (P = 0.002). However, there was no significant difference in the time interval to return to normal oxygen level (from SpO2 below 93%) or death rate between groups (P > 0.05). Conclusion There is significant association between hospital stay and lower serum vitamin D levels. However, the relationship between vitamin D status and death rate or the time interval to return to normal oxygen levels is not significant.","Nasiri, Maryam; Khodadadi, Javad; Molaei, Sedigheh",Int J Infect Dis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971221003957?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2021.04.083; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971221003957; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33940189/,476
627952,327P COVID-19 in patients with oncohematologic diseases in Kazakhstan,2020-11-30,"BACKGROUND: Unlike influenza viruses, little is known about the prevalence and seasonality of other respiratory viruses because laboratory surveillance for non-influenza respiratory viruses is not well developed or supported in China and other resource-limited countries. We studied the interference between seasonal epidemics of influenza viruses and five other common viruses that cause respiratory illnesses in Hong Kong from 2014 to 2017. METHODS: The weekly laboratory-confirmed positive rates of each virus were analyzed from 2014 to 2017 in Hong Kong to describe the epidemiological trends and interference between influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), adenovirus, enterovirus and rhinovirus. A sinusoidal model was established to estimate the peak timing of each virus by phase angle parameters. RESULTS: Seasonal features of the influenza viruses, PIV, enterovirus and adenovirus were obvious, whereas annual peaks of RSV and rhinovirus were not observed. The incidence of the influenza viruses usually peaked in February and July, and the summer peaks in July were generally caused by the H3 subtype of influenza A alone. When influenza viruses were active, other viruses tended to have a low level of activity. The peaks of the influenza viruses were not synchronized. An epidemic of rhinovirus tended to shift the subsequent epidemics of the other viruses. CONCLUSION: The evidence from recent surveillance data in Hong Kong suggests that viral interference during the epidemics of influenza viruses and other common respiratory viruses might affect the timing and duration of subsequent epidemics of a certain or several viruses.","Zheng, Xueying; Song, Zhengyu; Li, Yapeng; Zhang, Juanjuan; Wang, Xi-Ling",BMC Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-017-2888-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29246199/,476
627960,Using excess deaths and testing statistics to determine COVID-19 mortalities,2021-05-17,"Since its discovery in the Hubei province of China, the global spread of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in millions of COVID-19 cases and hundreds of thousands of deaths. The spread throughout Asia, Europe, and the Americas has presented one of the greatest infectious disease threats in recent history and has tested the capacity of global health infrastructures. Since no effective vaccine is available, isolation techniques to prevent infection such as home quarantine and social distancing while in public have remained the cornerstone of public health interventions. While government and health officials were charged with implementing stay-at-home strategies, many of which had little guidance as to the consequences of how quickly to begin them. Moreover, as the local epidemic curves have been flattened, the same officials must wrestle with when to ease or cease such restrictions as to not impose economic turmoil. To evaluate the effects of quarantine strategies during the initial epidemic, an agent based modeling framework was created to take into account local spread based on geographic and population data with a corresponding interactive desktop and web-based application. Using the state of Massachusetts in the United States of America, we have illustrated the consequences of implementing quarantines at different time points after the initial seeding of the state with COVID-19 cases. Furthermore, we suggest that this application can be adapted to other states, small countries, or regions within a country to provide decision makers with critical information necessary to best protect human health.","Kirpich, A.; Koniukhovskii, V.; Shvartc, V.; Skums, P.; Weppelmann, T.

METHODS: A 37-question online survey was designed and distributed to physician members of three NI physician organizations. RESULTS: A total of 151 individual survey responses were obtained. Reduced mechanical thrombectomy procedures compared with pre-pandemic were observed with 32% reporting a greater than 50% reduction in thrombectomy volumes. In concert with most (76%) reporting at least a 25% reduction in non-mechanical thrombectomy urgent NI procedures and a nearly unanimous (96%) cessation of non-urgent elective cases, 68% of physicians reported dramatic reductions (>50%) in overall NI procedural volume compared with pre-pandemic. Increased door-to-puncture times were reported by 79%. COVID-19-positive infections occurred in 1% of physician respondents: an additional 8% quarantined for suspected infection. Sixty-six percent of respondents reported increased career stress, 56% increased personal life/family stress, and 35% increased career burnout.

628336,Virtual academic detailing (e-Detailing): A vital tool during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020-07-31,"Background Studies have found different waning rates of neutralising antibodies compared with binding antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The impact of neutralising antibody waning rate at the individual patient level on the longevity of immunity remains unknown. We aimed to investigate the peak levels and dynamics of neutralising antibody waning and IgG avidity maturation over time, and correlate this with clinical parameters, cytokines, and T-cell responses. Methods We did a longitudinal study of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 up to day 180 post-symptom onset by monitoring changes in neutralising antibody levels using a previously validated surrogate virus neutralisation test. Changes in antibody avidities and other immune markers at different convalescent stages were determined and correlated with clinical features. Using a machine learning algorithm, temporal change in neutralising antibody levels was classified into five groups and used to predict the longevity of neutralising antibody-mediated immunity. Findings We approached 517 patients for participation in the study, of whom 288 consented for outpatient follow-up and collection of serial blood samples. 164 patients were followed up and had adequate blood samples collected for analysis, with a total of 546 serum samples collected, including 128 blood samples taken up to 180 days post-symptom onset. We identified five distinctive patterns of neutralising antibody dynamics as follows: negative, individuals who did not, at our intervals of sampling, develop neutralising antibodies at the 30% inhibition level (19 [12%] of 164 patients); rapid waning, individuals who had varying levels of neutralising antibodies from around 20 days after symptom onset, but seroreverted in less than 180 days (44 [27%] of 164 patients); slow waning, individuals who remained neutralising antibody-positive at 180 days post-symptom onset (52 [29%] of 164 patients); persistent, although with varying peak neutralising antibody levels, these individuals had minimal neutralising antibody decay (52 [32%] of 164 patients); and delayed response, a small group that showed an unexpected increase of neutralising antibodies during late convalescence (at 90 or 180 days after symptom onset; three [2%] of 164 patients). Persistence of neutralising antibodies was associated with disease severity and sustained level of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. By contrast, T-cell responses were similar among the different neutralising antibody dynamics groups. On the basis of the different decay dynamics, we established a prediction algorithm that revealed a wide range of neutralising antibody longevity, varying from around 40 days to many decades. Interpretation Neutralising antibody response dynamics in patients who have recovered from COVID-19 vary greatly, and prediction of immune longevity can only be accurately determined at the individual level. Our findings emphasise the importance of public health and social measures in the ongoing pandemic outbreak response, and might have implications for longevity of immunity after vaccination.

Methods: One hundred and thirty-eight patients with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection at Wuhan Union Hospital, between February 8 and March 31, 2020, were included in the study analysis. General information and data on clinical characteristics were collected from patients' medical records. Participants' responses to self-report measures of psychological status were also collected. Results: Anxiety levels, depression levels, and recovery rates were significantly higher among women compared to men. Conversely, chronic disease history and smoking rates, dry cough incidence, C-reactive protein levels, and disease severity were significantly higher among men than women (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Female patients experienced more severe psychological issues, due to higher levels of anxiety and stress, than male patients; indicating that more attention should be paid to the psychological care of female patients. In contrast, the general condition of male patients was more severe, particularly among elderly male patients with a history of chronic disease and smoking, suggesting that, to prevent and control 2019-nCoV infection, male patients should be encouraged to quit smoking as soon as possible to reduce the risk of severe pneumonia.","Han, Huiwu; Peng, Xiaobei; Zheng, Fan; Deng, Guiyuan; Cheng, Xiaocui; Peng, Liming",Front Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34211948/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.619482,476

629077,Participatory syndromic surveillance as a tool for tracking COVID-19 in Bangladesh,2020-09-01,"Fish production has been practiced since ancient Egypt and China. It has become a fast-growing agricultural sector that provides animal protein for most people globally. While China is the leading country in the world, Egypt and Nigeria stand on the top in Africa. The overall fishery production potential of Ethiopian water bodies is estimated to be 94,500 tons per year, while the actual production is 38,370 tons. Despite more water bodies and more fish diversity in the region, fish production and marketing is very low. This review is undertaken to assess the main factors affecting fish production and the marketing chain in Gambella region. Despite the known water and fish potential of the region, fish production is very low. Major factors contributing to a reduction in fish production in the region include inefficient fishing gears, poor transportation access, poor postharvest handling, low price at the landing site, and improper market place. Drying is the predominant postharvest technique and fishing methods are of a subsistence basis. All the fishing activities take place in the natural environment, and aquaculture is not yet established. Enough modern and efficient gears need to be made available. Other modern postharvest handling techniques need to be introduced to ensure a longer shelf life of fish after harvest. Infrastructures need to be constructed to access all water bodies in the region. Because the region has such water resource potential and incredible fish species diversity, the aquaculture needs to be established and popularized. Traceability needs to be adopted in the region to prevent food-borne diseases. Based on this paper, the government and other stakeholders could develop policy considering the issue of the fishery status of the region.","Deng, Gatriay Tut",ScientificWorldJournal,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/5260693; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32607080/,476

Although most COVID‐19 cases are characterised by a mild, self‐limiting disease course, a considerable subset of patients develop a more severe condition, varying from pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) to multi‐organ failure (MOF). Progression of COVID‐19 is thought to occur as a result of a complex interplay between multiple pathophysiological mechanisms, all of which may orchestrate SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and contribute to organ‐specific tissue damage. In this respect, dissecting currently available knowledge of COVID‐19 immunopathogenesis is crucially important, not only to improve our understanding of its pathophysiology but also to fuel the rationale of both novel and repurposed treatment modalities. Various immune‐mediated pathways during SARS‐CoV‐2 infection are relevant in this context, which relate to innate immunity, adaptive immunity, and autoimmunity. Pathological findings in tissue specimens of patients with COVID‐19 provide valuable information with regard to our understanding of pathophysiology as well as the development of evidence‐based treatment regimens. This review provides an updated overview of the main pathological changes observed in COVID‐19 within the most commonly affected organ systems, with special emphasis on immunopathology. Current management strategies for COVID‐19 include supportive care and the use of repurposed or symptomatic drugs, such as dexamethasone, remdesivir, and anticoagulants. Ultimately, prevention is key to combat COVID‐19, and this requires appropriate measures to attenuate its spread and, above all, the development and implementation of effective vaccines. © 2021 The Authors.

Currently, air toxicity is monitored only for single or limited number of known toxicants, thus failing to fully warn against possible hazardous air. Here, using a photoionization detector (PID) or GC-MS/FID we found that within minutes living rats emitted distinctive profiles of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) via breath when exposed to various airborne toxicants such as endotoxin, O3, ricin, and CO2. Compared to background indoor air, when exposed to ricin or endotoxin aerosols breath-borne VOC levels, especially that of carbon disulfide, were shown to decrease, while elevated levels were observed for O3 and CO2 exposures. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed a clear contrast in breath-borne VOCs profiles of rats among different toxicant exposures. MicroRNA regulations such as miR-33, miR-146a and miR-155 from rats’ blood samples also suggested varying mechanisms used by the rats in combating different air toxicant challenges. By integrating living rats, breath sampling, and VOC online detection, we pioneered a system that can real-time monitor air toxicity without the need of detecting specific species. Importantly, rats were shown to be able to sniff off toxic air. Abstract Graphic","Chen, Haoxuan; Li, Xinyue; Yao, Maosheng",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/739003,476
632933,Clozapine and COVID-19,2020-08-11,"BACKGROUND & PURPOSE: Pandemics such as COVID-19 can lead to severe shortages in healthcare resources, requiring the development of evidence-based Crisis Standard of Care (CSC) protocols. A protocol that limits the resuscitation of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA) to events that are more likely to result in a positive outcome can lower hospital burdens and reduce emergency medical services resources and infection risk, although it would come at the cost of lives lost that could otherwise be saved. Our primary objective was to evaluate candidate OHCA CSC protocols involving known predictors of survival and identify the protocol that results in the smallest resource burden, as measured by the number of hospitalizations required per favorable OHCA outcome achieved. Our secondary objective was to describe the effects of the CSC protocols in terms of health outcomes and other measures of resource burden. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adult patients in the Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival (CARES) database. Non-traumatic OHCA events from 2018 were included (n = 79,533). Candidate CSC protocols involving combinations of known predictors of good survival for OHCA were applied to the existing dataset to measure the resulting numbers of resuscitation attempts, transportations to hospital, hospital admissions, and favorable neurological outcomes. These outcomes were also assessed under Standard Care, defined as no CSC protocol applied to the data. RESULTS: The CSC protocol with the smallest number of hospitalizations per survivor with a favorable neurological outcome was that an OHCA resuscitation should only be attempted if the arrest was witnessed by emergency medical services or the first monitored rhythm was shockable (number of hospitalizations: 2.26 [95% CI: 2.21–2.31] vs. 3.46 [95% CI: 3.39–3.53] under Standard Care). This rule resulted in significant reductions in resource utilization (46.1% of hospitalizations and 29.2% of resuscitation attempts compared to Standard Care) while still preserving 70.5% of the favorable neurological outcomes under Standard Care. For every favorable neurological outcome lost under this CSC protocol, 6.3 hospital beds were made free that could be used to treat other patients. CONCLUSION: In a pandemic scenario, pre-hospital CSC protocols that might not otherwise be considered have the potential to greatly improve overall survival, and this study provides an evidence-based approach towards selecting such a protocol. As this study was performed using data generated before the COVID-19 pandemic, future studies incorporating pandemic-era data will further help develop evidence-based CSC protocols.","Natalzia, Peter; Murk, William; Thompson, Jeffrey J.; Dorsett, Maia; Cushman, Jeremy T.; Reed, Philip; Clemency, Brian M.",Resuscitation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32758516/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resuscitation.2020.07.021; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300957220302987; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0300957220302987,476

In 2020 with their cocirculation, coinfections began to be observed and reported in different countries. As expected, this syndemic is evident in different areas and deserves proper characterisation and studies in Peru. METHODS: We retrospectively assessed the clinical, epidemiological, diagnostic characteristics and outcomes in a Social Security Hospital of Chiclayo, Lambayeque, Peru, of patients that were diagnosed simultaneously with COVID-19 and dengue during May–August 2020. RESULTS: A total of 50 patients with COVID-19/dengue coinfection were identified. Of them, 60% presented thrombocytopenia, and 52% fever, among other findings. The case fatality rate in this group was 28%, being higher in those patients initially classified as severe dengue (100%), as well as in females (55%) than males (21%) (OR = 4.65; 95%CI 1.18–18.45). DISCUSSION: Co-occurrence of COVID-19/Dengue is growing as a consequence of the syndemic of these viral diseases in endemic areas, such as Latin America, and as both conditions may evolve to severe disease, their epidemiological but clinical interaction in terms of outcomes need further assessment in future studies in the region.","Mejía-Parra, Jorge Luis; Aguilar-Martinez, Sergio; Fernández-Mogollón, Jorge Luis; Luna, Camila; Bonilla-Aldana, D.

The practice of assisted reproduction during this pandemic presents unique challenges in addition to the risks that have been identified for general clinical care. The established good tissue practices employed in laboratories are not designed to protect gametes and embryos from an airborne virus, particularly one that may be shed by an asymptomatic staff member. Armed with theoretical risks, but lacking direct evidence, assisted reproduction teams must examine every aspect of their practice, identify areas at risk for exposure to the SARS-Cov-2 virus and develop a mitigation plan. Several professional fertility societies have created guidelines for best practices in patient care during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This study investigated seven commercially available SARS-CoV-2 serological assays in samples from non-infected individuals and hospitalized patients. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 qualitative serological assays by Abbott (IgG), Beckman (IgG), DiaSorin (IgG), EUROIMMUN (IgG and IgA), Roche and Bio-Rad (Total) were evaluated using specimens collected pre-December 2019 (n=393), from nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) negative patients (n=40), and from 53 patients with COVID-19 by NAAT collected 3-21 days post-onset of symptoms (POS) (N=83). Negative agreement (NA), positive agreement (PA), and positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) at prevalences of 5% and 10% were calculated. RESULTS: The overall %NA;95% CI in the negative samples were: Roche 99.8%; 99.3-100.2, Beckman 99.8%; 98.7-100.0, Abbott and Bio-Rad 99.3%; 98.0-99.9, DiaSorin 98.4; 97.2-99.6, EUROIMMUN IgG 97.5%; 95.5-98.7, and EUROIMMUN IgA 79.7%; 75.9-83.5), accounting for positive/equivocal results as false positives. The %PA; 95% CI in samples collected 14+days POS (n=24) were: Bio-Rad 83.3%; 68.4-98.2, Abbott and Roche 79.2%; 62.9-95.4, EUROIMMUN IgA 70.8%; 52.6-89.0, Beckman 58.3%; 38.6-78.1, DiaSorin 54.2; 34.2-74.1, and EUROIMMUN IgG 50.0%; 30.0-70.0, accounting for negative/equivocal results as false negatives.

The predicted AVPs have been docked against various host as well as viral proteins. The interaction of small AVPs seems capable of interfering with binding between viral protein and its host counterpart.

635163,COVID‐19 risk triage: Engaging residents in telephonic screening,2020-06-02,"BACKGROUND: Obesity, overweight and unemployment are interlinked, with debilitating effects on mortality, health, wellbeing and quality of life. Existing interventions to reduce overweight, obesity and unemployment have addressed these challenges independent of each other with limited success. The Adding to Social capital and individual Potential In disadvantaged REgions (ASPIRE) project will develop an innovative model using a combination of skills training and health and wellbeing interventions to improve health, wellbeing, quality of life and reduce overweight, obesity and unemployment in England and France. The aim of this paper is to outline the protocol for evaluating the ASPIRE project to examine the effectiveness of the intervention and clarify the mechanisms and contextual factors which interact to achieve outcomes. METHODS: A mixed-method realist evaluation using a single-group before-and-after design will be used. The evaluation will consist of development of an initial programme theory, theory validation and refinement using quantitative and qualitative data to understand the causal mechanisms, contexts of implementation and their interactions that result in outcomes observed in ASPIRE. Primary outcomes that will be assessed are change in body weight and body mass index, reemployment and a rise on the ASPIRE participation ladder. The ASPIRE participation ladders consists of a series of 5 steps to engage participants in the project. The first step on the ladder is joining an ASPIRE hub with paid employment as the final step on the ladder. Secondary outcomes will be physical activity, diet quality, self-efficacy and health-related quality of life. Both quantitative and qualitative approaches are appropriate in this study because the use of validated questionnaires and objective measures will demonstrate how much the intervention addressed outcomes related to weight loss and reemployment and the qualitative data (photovoice) will provide insights into the contexts and experiences that are unique to participants in the project. DISCUSSION: The results from this evaluation will provide an understanding of how a model of health-related interventions which improve health, wellbeing and maintenance of a healthy lifestyle could reduce overweight, obesity and unemployment. The findings will enable the adaptation of this model for effective implementation in different contexts and circumstances.

635925,"Reflections on COVID‐19 in Sydney, Australia",2020-04-22,"The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) has had multifaceted effects on students, their families, and the educators who support their learning. Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, one of the most notable changes for schools was the sudden move to distance learning-an unprecedented disruption to academic, social, and emotional instruction. Social and emotional learning (SEL) skills play an important role in human development by supporting academic success and overall well-being, including skills for effectively coping with stressors such as those imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Building on previous work, we created the Crisis Response Educator SEL Survey (CRESS) to examine predictors of SEL implementation during the pandemic. Structural equation models (SEMs) were used to predict: (a) educators' reported challenges implementing SEL during distance learning; (b) educator SEL implementation with students and use of social and emotional (SE) strategies for themselves; and (c) educator self-judgment and emotional exhaustion. Predictors included school/district guidance to support SEL, school/district support of educator SE needs, and the priority on SEL for the school and the educator. Our sample consisted of 219 educators committed to SEL who reported on their experience with SEL during distance learning toward the end of the 2019-2020 school year. Findings suggest that school/district support of educator SE needs predicts lower levels of challenge implementing SEL during distance learning and lower levels of educator burnout and self-judgment, whereas greater school/district guidance to support SEL was associated with more SEL implementation with students and more educator use of SE strategies for themselves.

Atrial fibrillation (AF), the arrhythmia most frequently diagnosed in older patients, associates with serious, thrombo-embolic, complications and high mortality. COVID-19 severely affects aged subjects, determining an important prothrombotic status. Purpose. Aim of this study was to evaluate mortality-related factors in older AF patients with COVID-19. Methods. We included 806 in-hospital COVID-19 patients aged 60 years or more hospitalized between March 1st and June 6th 2020 and enrolled in a multicenter observational study. Results. The prevalence of AF was 21.8%. In-hospital mortality was higher in the AF group (36.9 vs. 27.5%; p = 0.015). Among AF patients, those who survived were younger (81 ± 8 vs. 84 ± 7 years; p = 0.002), had a lower CHA2DS2-VASc score (3.9 ± 1.6 vs. 4.4 ± 1.3; p = 0.02) and were more frequently treated with oral anticoagulants at admission (63.1 vs. 32.3%; p < 0.001) than those who died in hospital. At multivariable logistic regression analysis, lower age (p = 0.042), a better functional profile (p = 0.007), less severe COVID-19 manifestations at admission (p = 0.001), and the use of Vitamin K antagonists (OR = 0.16, 95%CI: 0.03-0.84; p = 0.031) or DOACs (OR = 0.22, 95%CI: 0.08-0.56; p = 0.002), compared to antiplatelet therapy or no treatment at all, were associated with a lower chance of in-hospital death. Conclusions. AF is a prevalent condition and a severity factor in older COVID-19 patients. Advanced age, dependency and severe clinical manifestations of disease characterized older AF subjects with a worse prognosis.

636539,The Covid-19 Pandemics: why Intersectionality Matters,2021-03-26,"Abstract The hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) membrane glycoprotein is present only in some members of the coronavirus family, including some strains of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). In the JHM strain of MHV, expression of the HE gene is variable and corresponds to the number of copies of a UCUAA pentanucleotide sequence present at the 3′-end of the leader RNA. This copy number varies among MHV strains, depending on their passage history. The JHM isolates with two copies of UCUAA in their leader RNA showed a high level of HE expression, whereas the JHM isolate with three copies had a low-level expression. In this study, the analysis of HE gene expression was extended to other MHV strains. The synthesis of HE mRNA in these viruses also correlates with the copy number of UCUAA in the leader RNA and the particular intergenic sequence preceding the HE gene. In one MHV strain, MHV-1, no detectable HE mRNA was synthesized, despite the presence of a proper transcription initiation signal. This lack of HE mRNA expression was consistent with a leader RNA containing three UCUAA copies. However, mutations and deletions within the coding region of the MHV-1 HE gene have generated a stretch of sequence which resembled the transcriptional initiation motif, and was shown to initiate the synthesis of a novel smaller mRNA. These findings strengthened the theory that interactions between leader RNA and transcriptional initiation sequences regulate MHV subgenomic mRNA transcription. Sequence analysis revealed that most MHV strains, through extensive mutations, deletions, or insertions, have lost the complete HE open reading frame, thus turning HE into a pseudogene. This high degree of variation is unusual as the other three structural proteins (spike, membrane, and nucleocapsid) are well-maintained. In contrast to bovine coronavirus, which apparently requires HE for viral replication, the HE protein in MHV may be only an accessory protein which is not necessary for viral replication. JHM and MHV-S, however, have preserved the expression of HE protein.","Yokomori, Kyoko; Banner, Lisa R.; Lai, Michael M.C.",Virology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/004268229190994M; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004268229190994M; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1649505/,476

636708,COVID-19 Growth Rate Decreases with Social Capital,2020-04-29,"Simply monitoring movement of the tailings dam wall does not address the cause of tailings dam failures and will therefore never be an effective method to reduce or prevent failures. Monitoring the causes of failures is more effective. The main cause of tailings dam failure is slope instability, which is caused by too much water in the wrong place. Accurate pore pressure monitoring of the pressure (weight) of water in the tailings storage facility (TSF) slopes and plotting of flow lines beneath and upstream of the TSF can guide and enable early intervention to prevent or delay failure. Remote monitoring linked to artificial intelligence and robotics to turn on pumps and open drains to address and remove the cause of failure can help reduce risk. Installation of multiple point piezometers in an accurate pattern allows the plotting of equipotentials and flow lines in three dimensions. Each TSF is unique and requires its own monitoring design, which should be tailored to match the age, structure, and specific causes of risk. Once understood, the monitoring system can be coupled to a reporting system to significantly reduce the risk of failure at both legacy and active sites.","Morton, Kym Lesley",Mine Water Environ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33424193/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10230-020-00736-0,476
637033,Impact of temperature on Covid 19 in India,2020-09-02,"A novel coronavirus termed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new strain of coronavirus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease, which emerged as a global pandemic. Data regarding the implications of COVID-19 disease at early gestation on fetal and obstetric outcomes is scarce. Thus, our aim was to investigate the effect of first and second trimester maternal COVID-19 disease on fetal and perinatal outcomes. This was a prospective cohort study of pregnant women with a laboratory-proven SARS-COV-2 infection contracted prior to 26 weeks gestation. Women were followed at a single tertiary medical center by serial sonographic examinations every 4–6 weeks to assess fetal well-being, growth, placental function, anatomic evaluation and signs of fetal infection. Amniocentesis was offered to assess amniotic fluid SARS-COV-2-PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and fetal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was offered at 30–32 weeks gestation. Demographic, obstetric and neonatal data were collected from history intake, medical charts or by telephone survey. Perinatal outcomes were compared between women infected at first vs. second trimester. 55 women with documented COVID-19 disease at early gestation were included and followed at our center. The mean maternal age was 29.6 ± 6.2 years and the mean gestational age at viral infection was 14.2 ± 6.7 weeks with 28 (51%) women infected at the first trimester and 27 (49%) at the second trimester. All patients but one experienced asymptomatic to mild symptoms. Of 22 patients who underwent amniocentesis, none had evidence of vertical transmission. None of the fetuses exhibited signs of central nervous system (CNS) disease, growth restriction and placental dysfunction on serial ultrasound examinations and fetal MRI. Pregnancies resulted in perinatal survival of 100% to date with mean gestational age at delivery of 38.6 ± 3.0 weeks and preterm birth <37 weeks rate of 3.4%. The mean birthweight was 3260 ± 411 g with no cases of small for gestational age infants. The obstetric and neonatal outcomes were similar among first vs. second trimester infection groups. We conclude SARS-CoV-2 infection at early gestation was not associated with vertical transmission and resulted in favorable obstetric and neonatal outcomes.","Rosen, Hadar; Bart, Yossi; Zlatkin, Rita; Ben-Sira, Liat; Ben Bashat, Dafna; Amit, Sharon; Cohen, Carmit; Regev-Yochay, Gili; Yinon, Yoav",J Clin Med,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10102152; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34065646/,476

(2021), published in Environmental Research, vol.192, January 2021. The study was carried out under challenging conditions and provides original data of great value for exploratory purposes. Nevertheless, we found that the authors have not considered the potential effect of the multiple hypothesis testing carried out until obtaining the final model on the increased occurrence of false discoveries by mere chance. After adjusting the results provided in the paper for the effects of multiple testing, we conclude that only one of the five factors cited as statistically significant and relevant in the article, living with someone who has suffered from COVID-19, remained significantly related to the relative prevalence of COVID-19. Therefore, the preeminent role given in the analysed work to walking the dog as one of the main transmission routes of COVID-19 probably does not correspond to an actual effect. Instead, until replicated by other studies, it should be considered a spurious discovery.","Gutiérrez-Hernández, Oliver; García, Luis V.",Environ Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34214558/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.111600; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001393512100894X?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S001393512100894X,476

We present a diagnostic method for serotype-specific IgG identification of dengue infection by a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), using high-affinity unnatural-base-containing DNA (UB-DNA) aptamers that recognize the four categorized serotypes. Using UB-DNA aptamers specific to each serotype of dengue NS1 proteins (DEN-NS1), we developed our aptamer–antibody sandwich ELISA for dengue diagnostics. Furthermore, IgGs highly specific to DEN-NS1 inhibited the serotype-specific NS1 detection, inspiring us to develop the competitive ELISA format for dengue serotype-specific IgG detection. Blood samples from Singaporean patients with primary or secondary dengue infections confirmed the highly specific IgG detection of this format, and the IgG production initially reflected the serotype of the past infection, rather than the recent infection. Using this dengue competitive ELISA format, cross-reactivity tests of 21 plasma samples from Singaporean Zika virus-infected patients revealed two distinct patterns: 8 lacked cross-reactivity, and 13 were positive with unique dengue serotype specificities, indicating previous dengue infection. This antigen-detection ELISA and antibody-detection competitive ELISA combination using the UB-DNA aptamers identifies both past and current viral infections and will facilitate specific medical care and vaccine development for infectious diseases.","Matsunaga, Ken-ichiro; Kimoto, Michiko; Lim, Vanessa Weixun; Thein, Tun-Linn; Vasoo, Shawn; Leo, Yee-Sin; Sun, William; Hirao, Ichiro",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-97339-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34504185/,476

Therefore, the purpose of the present research is investigating the incidence of COVID-19 and laboratory data and epidemiologic factors in liver transplant recipients and the patients on the waiting list for liver transplantation. In this study, we evaluated the records of patients on the waiting list for liver transplantation and recipients of liver transplant. Demographic data, underlying disease, history of drug use and participants’ outcomes were collected. The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection for all patients was confirmed using a nasopharyngeal swab specimen with real-time RT-PCR. During the study period, 172 patients were enrolled, among whom 85 patients (49.4%) were on the waiting list for liver transplantation and 87 patients (50.6%) were recipients of liver transplant. Out of them, 10 (5.8%) had a positive result for SARS-CoV-2. Of these patients, 7.05% (6/85) and 4.6% (4/87) of patients on the waiting list and recipients of liver transplant were positive for SARS-CoV-2, respectively. Patients on the waiting list with COVID-19 infection had higher median of albumin, ALT, AST, TBIL, DBIL, HDL and LDL value. In summary, the incidence of COVID-19 in liver transplant patients was slightly high. The existence of underlying liver diseases should be well known as one of the poor predictive factors for worse outcomes in patients with COVID-19.

In this field, the literature shows that the combination of green and agile indicators has been ignored by researchers. Hence, this research attempts to study the SSP considering green and agile aspects, simultaneously. To do this, an efficient hybrid fuzzy decision-making approach is developed based on the Fuzzy Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (FDEMATEL), Fuzzy Best-Worst Method (FBWM), Fuzzy Analytic Network Process (FANP), and Fuzzy Vlse Kriterijumsk Optimizacija Kompromisno Resenje (FVIKOR) methods. Then, to show the efficiency and application of the proposed approach, a case study in the medical devices industry is investigated. After determining the main indicators and alternatives, the interrelationships between indicators are identified employing FDEMATEL. Then, the weights of indicators are calculated using integrated FBWM-FANP. Finally, the potential suppliers are ranked applying FVIKOR. Based on the obtained results, price and greenness are the more important aspects and also material costs, environmental performance evaluation, manufacture flexibility, service level, and system reliability are the most important criteria for the green-agile supplier selection problem in the medical devices industry.

644112,The uneven distribution of futurity: Slow emergencies and the event of COVID‐19,2021-08-19,"OBJECTIVE: There is mounting evidence in support of exercise and physical activity as a first-line approach to managing symptoms and potentially altering disease progression in people with Parkinson disease (PD). For many patients, a critical gap is the need for expert guidance to overcome barriers, set realistic goals, and provide personalized advice to optimize exercise uptake and adherence. The purpose of this case report is to describe a physical activity coaching program for individuals newly diagnosed with PD (Engage-PD) and to highlight rapid modifications made to this program in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS (CASE DESCRIPTION): Engage-PD is a single cohort implementation study of a coaching intervention grounded in self-determination theory being conducted at Columbia University Parkinson’s Foundation Center of Excellence in New York City, the early epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. The project was uniquely positioned to be adapted to telehealth delivery and to address an immediate need for support and guidance in the home environment, including people with early-mid stage PD. Participants completed baseline and follow up (3 months) assessments, and participated in up to four coaching sessions all delivered via telehealth platform. The intervention incorporated 1: 1 coaching, goal-setting, physical activity monitoring, and use of a disease-specific workbook to promote and support safe exercise uptake. RESULTS: While the program is ongoing, 52 referrals were reicieved and 27 individuals enrolled with PD in the first 2 months of the pandemic for a recruitment rate of 52%. Although direct comparisons with pre-coronavirus recruitment are difficult due to the recency of the Engage-PD implementation study, this recruitment rate was larger than expected, which may have been due to several factors (eg, most patients had limited, if any, access to in-person programs and therapy services during this time, so the Engage program filled an immediate need to provide exercise and activity guidance). There was a wide range of scores for both baseline physical activity and self-efficacy measures. CONCLUSION: Remotely-delivered interventions may serve as a sustainable platform for physical activity coaching programs for people with PD as well as other neurodegenerative diseases. IMPACT: With the uncertainty brought about by the current pandemic, this case report highlights the opportunity to shift the current model of care for individuals with neurodegenerative diseases such as PD.","Quinn, Lori; Macpherson, Chelsea; Long, Katrina; Shah, Hiral",Phys Ther,https://doi.org/10.1093/ptj/pzaa128; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32734298/,476

The primary aim is to determine, whether a lockdown is negatively associated with happiness, notwithstanding the characteristics of a country or the strictness of the lockdown regulations. Second, we compare the effect size of the lockdown on happiness between these countries. We use Difference‐in‐Difference estimations to determine the association between lockdown and happiness and a Least Squares Dummy Variable estimation to study the heterogeneity in the effect size of the lockdown by country. Our results show that a lockdown is associated with a decline in happiness, regardless of the characteristics of the country or the type and duration of its lockdown regulations.

Après revue de la littérature, nous retrouvons un cas similaire en Italie [1] également mal toléré avec nécessité de ponction en urgence. La mauvaise tolérance et l’évolution vers ce tableau clinique pourraient être expliquées par la décharge cytokinique inflammatoire liée au virus. L’atteinte péricardique semble rare mais reste non quantifiée, à ce jour. Les différentes études radiologiques relèvent des épanchements péricardiques peu fréquents [2]. Sur le plan thérapeutique, l’introduction d’anti-inflammatoire non stéroïdiens semble contre-indiquée compte tenu du risque d’aggravation respiratoire. La Colchicine a une place reconnue dans le traitement des péricardites et pourrait représenter une thérapeutique intéressante par le blocage de l’assemblage des inflammasomes NLRP3 et de la libération des cytokines [3]. Les limites de ce case report sont l’absence de confirmation diagnostique de COVID-19 au frottis naso-pharyngé (sensibilité de 59 % [4]) et l’absence d’analyse virologique du liquide péricardique.

From there it has been rapidly spreading to many cities inside and outside China. Nowadays more than 33 millions with deaths surpassing 1 million have been recorded worldwide thus representing a major health issue. Rapid development of a protective vaccine against COVID-19 is therefore of paramount importance. Here we demonstrated that recombinantly expressed receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein homologous to SARS binds to ACE2, the viral receptor. Higly repetitive display of RBD on immunologically optimized virus-like particles derived from cucumber mosaic virus (CuMVTT) resulted in a vaccine candidate that induced high levels of specific antibodies in mice which were able to block binding of spike protein to ACE2 and potently neutralized COVID-19 virus in vitro.","Zha, Lisha; Zhao, Hongxin; Mohsen, Mona O.; Hong, Liang; Zhou, Yuhang; Li, Zehua; Chen, Hongquan; Liu, Xuelan; Chang, Xinyue; Zhang, Jie; Li, Dong; Wu, Ke; Vogel, Monique; Bachmann, Martin F; Wang, Junfeng",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.06.079830,476

FA is found to bind to furin-protease and spike: ACE2 interface of SARS-CoV-2. In clinical studies, FA level was lowest among severe patients compared to mild and moderate disease. A single controlled study reported the benefit of combination of folic acid with Pyridoxine & cyanocobalamin in terms of clinical and laboratory cure parameters. One hypothesis associates the differences in geographical variation of disease severity with prevalence of methyl tertahydrofolic acid reductase (MTHFR) C677T polymorphism. Other possible domains, where FA is hypothesized to be beneficial are COVID-19 associated pulmonary hypertension and hyper-homocystinemia. So, scientific justification of using folic acid as placebo in COVID-19 trials seems scientifically not credible and this may be one of the major factors for failure of many agents.

Evolutionary and psychological research has shown that touch is an important part of bond-building and emotion communication; loneliness is intimately related to these elements as well. In this paper, we ask whether physical contact reduces feelings of loneliness —which might derive from evolutionary ancient bonding mechanisms—despite a cultural context that is relatively non-tactile. METHOD: An experimental study (40 participants, 13 males) tested for observable effects of touch on loneliness scores in a low-contact culture to analyse whether they respond positively to that stimulus despite cultural training against it. RESULTS: Participants exposed to physical contact reported significantly lower neglect scores from their close relationships in a short loneliness scale, thus suggesting that there is an underlying mechanism that persists despite enculturation. The effects were particularly strong among single people, which could mean that lower loneliness among married people might be partly explained by the regular availability of physical contact. Participants in the experimental condition also showed a faster reduction in heart rate, interpreted as a sign of physiological wellbeing. CONCLUSIONS: These findings help to specify mechanisms within the evolutionary theoretical framework of loneliness that link internal feelings to environmental cues. This article aims at contributing to a more complex discussion on the interactions between emotions, cultural practices and psychological well-being.","Heatley Tejada, A.; Dunbar, R. I.

Airborne transmission has been recognized as one of the major transmission routes for SARS-CoV-2. This paper presents a systematic approach for evaluating the effectiveness of multi-scale IAQ control strategies in mitigating the infection risk in different scenarios. The IAQ control strategies across multiple scales from a whole building to rooms, and to cubical and personal microenvironments and breathing zone, are introduced, including elevated outdoor airflow rates, high-efficiency filters, advanced air distribution strategies, standalone air cleaning technologies, personal ventilation and face masks. The effectiveness of these strategies for reducing the risk of COVID-19 infection are evaluated for specific indoor spaces, including long-term care facility, school and college, meat plant, retail stores, hospital, office, correctional facility, hotel, restaurant, casino and transportation spaces like airplane, cruise ship, subway, bus and taxi, where airborne transmission are more likely to occur due to high occupancy densities. The baseline cases of these spaces are established according to the existing standards, guidelines or practices. Several integrated mitigation strategies are recommended and classified based on their relative cost and effort of implementation for each indoor space. They can be applied to help meet the current challenge of ongoing COVID-19, and provide better preparation for other possible epidemics and pandemics of airborne infectious diseases in the future.","Shen, Jialei; Kong, Meng; Dong, Bing; Birnkrant, Michael J.; Zhang, Jianshun",Build Environ,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2021.107926; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33967376/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360132321003309; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132321003309?v=s5,476

Although individuals may be confronted with multidimensional stressors during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, their appraisal of the impact and severity of these events might vary. In this study, connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM) with leave-one-out cross-validation was conducted to predict individual perceived stress (PS) from whole-brain functional connectivity data from 817 participants. The results showed that the feeling of stress could be predicted by the interaction between the default model network and salience network, which are involved in emotion regulation and salience attribution, respectively. Key nodes that contributed to the prediction model comprised regions mainly located in the limbic systems and temporal lobe. Critically, the CPM model of PS based on regular days can be generalized to predict individual PS levels during the COVID-19 pandemic, which is a multidimensional, uncontrollable stressful situation. The stability of the results was demonstrated by two independent datasets. The present work not only expands existing knowledge regarding the neural mechanism of PS but also may help identify high-risk individuals in healthy populations.","Liu, Peiduo; Yang, Wenjing; Zhuang, Kaixiang; Wei, Dongtao; Yu, Rongjun; Huang, Xiting; Qiu, Jiang",Neurobiol Stress,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385021/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ynstr.2020.100285,476

Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are often used by healthcare professionals to assess the impact of a patient’s condition (and treatment) on quality of life. However, we are not aware of any measures developed specifically for people requiring lower limb reconstructive surgery. Consequently, it is not clear the extent to which current PROMs accurately and specifically measure the outcomes that are important to these patients. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The ‘PROLLIT’ (Patient-Reported Outcome Measure for Lower Limb Reconstruction) involves three phases: to explore what is important to patients with regard to quality of life (phase 1), ascertain whether current measures adequately capture these experiences (phase 2) and if not begin, the development of a new PROM (phase 3). The population of interest is people requiring, undergoing or after undergoing reconstructive surgery for a lower limb condition. In this paper, we describe phase 1, which aims to develop a conceptual framework to identify and map what is important to this group with regard to social interactions, employment, perceived health and quality of life after condition onset/injury and throughout recovery. The conceptual framework will be developed through three steps: (step A) a qualitative evidence synthesis, (step B) a qualitative study with patients and staff to explore patient’s views and experiences of lower limb reconstructive surgery and (step C) a round table discussion with key stakeholders where findings from step A and step B will be brought together and used to finalise the conceptual framework. ETHICS CONSIDERATION AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been granted for the qualitative data collection (step B) from South Central Berkshire Research Ethics committee (REF:20/SC/0114).

653600,Acute Limb Ischemia Complicated by Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia in an Asymptomatic COVID-19 Patient,2021-07-04,"Seasonality of acute viral respiratory diseases is a well-known and yet not fully understood phenomenon. Several models have been proposed to explain the regularity of yearly recurring outbreaks and the phase-differences observed at different latitudes on Earth. Such models consider known internal causes, primarily the periodic emergence of new virus variants that evade the host immune response. Yet, this alone, is generally unable to explain the regularity of recurrences and the observed phase-differences. Here we show that seasonality of viral respiratory diseases, as well as its distribution with latitude on Earth, can be fully explained by the virucidal properties of UV-B and A Solar photons through a daily, minute-scale, resonant forcing mechanism. Such an induced periodicity can last, virtually unperturbed, from tens to hundreds of cycles, and even in presence of internal dynamics (host’s loss of immunity) much slower than seasonal will, on a long period, generate seasonal oscillations.","Nicastro, Fabrizio; Sironi, Giorgia; Antonello, Elio; Bianco, Andrea; Biasin, Mara; Brucato, John R.; Ermolli, Ilaria; Pareschi, Giovanni; Salvati, Marta; Tozzi, Paolo; Trabattoni, Daria; Clerici, Mario",iScience,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004220307975?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2589004220307975; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2020.101605; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32995710/,476

The overall death rate of COVID-19 pneumonia in the Chinese population was 4%. Objectives: To describe the process of hospitalization and critical care of patients who died of COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: This was a multicenter observational study of 109 decedents with COVID-19 pneumonia from three hospitals in Wuhan. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were collected and analyzed, and the final date of follow-up was February 24, 2020. Results: The mean age of 109 decedents with COVID-19 pneumonia was 70.7 years, 35 patients (32.1%) were female, and 85 patients (78.0%) suffered from one or more underlying comorbidities. Multiple organ failure, especially respiratory failure and heart failure, appeared in all patients even at the early stage of disease. Overall, the mean time from onset of symptoms to death was 22.3 days. All 109 hospitalized patients needed admission to an intensive care unit (ICU); however, because of limited availability, only 51 (46.8%) could be admitted. The period from hospitalization to death in the ICU group and non-ICU group was 15.9 days (standard deviation = 8.8 d) and 12.5 days (8.6 d, P = 0.044), respectively. Conclusions: Mortality due to COVID-19 pneumonia was concentrated in patients above the age of 65 years, especially those with major comorbidities. Patients who were admitted to the ICU lived longer than those who were not. Our findings should aid in the recognition and clinical management of such infections, especially with regard to ICU resource allocation.","Du, Rong-Hui; Liu, Li-Min; Yin, Wen; Wang, Wen; Guan, Lu-Lu; Yuan, Ming-Li; Li, Yu-Lei; Hu, Yi; Li, Xu-Yan; Sun, Bing; Peng, Peng; Shi, Huan-Zhong",Ann Am Thorac Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32255382/; https://doi.org/10.1513/annalsats.202003-225oc,476

We assessed the ability of laboratory-confirmed deaths to capture mortality in the EU during the 2009 pandemic, and examined the likelihood that these findings are applicable to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Methods We present unpublished results from the Global Pandemic Mortality (GLaMOR) project, in which country-specific mortality estimates were made for the 2009 influenza H1N1p pandemic. These estimates were compared to laboratory-confirmed deaths during the 2009 pandemic to estimate the ability of surveillance systems to capture pandemic mortality. Results For the 2009 influenza H1N1p pandemic, we estimated that the proportion of true pandemic deaths captured by laboratory-confirmed deaths was approximately 67%. Several differences (e.g. age groups affected) between the two pandemics make it unlikely that this capture rate will be equally high for SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion The surveillance of laboratory-confirmed deaths in the EU during the 2009 pandemic was more accurate than previously assumed. We hypothesize that this method is less reliable for SARS-CoV-2. Near-real-time excess all-cause mortality estimates, routinely compiled by EuroMOMO, probably form a better indicator of pandemic mortality.

Design This retrospective cohort study utilized a gradient boosting algorithm to evaluate risk of COVID-19 infection (i.e., presence of at least one confirmed COVID-19 resident) in NHs. Setting and participants: The model was trained on outcomes from 1,146 NHs in Massachusetts, Georgia, and New Jersey, reporting COVID-19 case data on April 20th, 2020. Risk indices generated from the model using data from May 4th were prospectively validated against outcomes reported on May 11th from 1,021 NHs in California. Methods Model features, pertaining to facility and community characteristics, were obtained from a self-constructed dataset based on multiple public and private sources. The model was assessed via out-of-sample area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity in the training (via 10-fold cross-validation) and validation datasets. Results The model’s mean AUC, sensitivity, and specificity over 10-fold cross-validation were 0.729 (95% CI: 0.690-0.767), 0.670 (95% CI: 0.477-0.862), and 0.611 (95% CI: 0.412-0.809), respectively. Prospective out-of-sample validation yielded similar performance measures (AUC: 0.721; sensitivity: 0.622; specificity: 0.713). The strongest predictors of COVID-19 infection were identified as the NH’s county’s infection rate and the number of separate units in the NH; other predictors included the county’s population density, historical Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services cited health deficiencies, and the NH’s resident density (in persons per 1,000 square feet). Additionally, the NH’s historical percentage of non-Hispanic White residents was identified as a protective factor. Conclusions and Implications A machine-learning model can help quantify and predict NH infection risk. The identified risk factors support the early identification and management of presymptomatic and asymptomatic individuals (e.g., staff) entering the NH from the surrounding community and the development of financially sustainable staff testing initiatives in preventing COVID-19 infection.","Sun, Christopher L.F.; Zuccarelli, Eugenio; Zerhouni, El Ghali A.; Lee, Jason; Muller, James; Scott, Karen M.; Lujan, Alida M.; Levi, Retsef",J Am Med Dir Assoc,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2020.08.030; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1525861020307362; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33032935/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1525861020307362?v=s5,476

DESIGN: A qualitative study using semistructured interviews. Data were analysed using framework analysis. SETTING: One large National Health Service integrated care trust. PARTICIPANTS: A purposive sample of 19 qualified health professionals (doctors, nurses or allied health professionals), working with patients with COVID-19 admitted to the hospitals between March and May 2020 were eligible to take part. RESULTS: Eight major categories were identified: (1) Working in a ‘war zone’, (2) ‘Going into a war zone without a weapon’, (3) ‘Patients come first’, (4) Impact of COVID-19, (5) Leadership and management, (6) Support systems, (7) Health professionals’ support needs, and (8) Camaraderie and pride. Health professionals reported increased levels of stress, anxiety and a lack of sleep. They prioritised their patients’ needs over their own and felt a professional obligation to be at work. A key finding was the reported camaraderie among the health professionals where they felt that they were ‘fighting this war together’. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a valuable insight into the experiences of some of the frontline health professionals working in a large London-based hospital trust during the first COVID-19 peak. Findings from this study could be used to inform how managers, leaders and organisations can better support their health professional staff during the current pandemic and beyond.","Baldwin, Sharin; George, Joicy",BMJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-054377; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34489298/,476

The theme of the humanization of care, understood as attention to the person as a whole, is a highly topical issue today. The humanization in the healthcare is intended as the ability to make the places of care and the same medical care practices more open, safer and painless, reconciling hospitality, information and comfort with care paths as much as possible in sharing with the patient and his family. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pursuing the purposes inherent in the concept of humanization of care and assistance, with the aim of offering Apulian citizens a complementary, but also fundamental, service in clinical-therapeutic assistance to the patient affected by COVID-19, in the hope of improving the quality of care, also in relation to the perception of the user, the Strategic Management of the AOU Policlinico of Bari has launched an experimental project that fits into the context of care quality, a crucial and not negligible issue, despite the extreme difficulties dictated by the ongoing medical emergency. RESULTS: The experimental project proposes an innovative clinical-organizational model which, through Information and Communications Technology (ICT), intends to make the management of COVID-19 patients optimal, safe and better, in all the spheres that jointly define the concept of Health.

656370,Online Involvement for Georgia Student Teachers During Covid-19,2021-06-03,"CK2 is a constitutively active Ser/Thr protein kinase, which phosphorylates hundreds of substrates, controls several signaling pathways, and is implicated in a plethora of human diseases. Its best documented role is in cancer, where it regulates practically all malignant hallmarks. Other well-known functions of CK2 are in human infections; in particular, several viruses exploit host cell CK2 for their life cycle. Very recently, also SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, has been found to enhance CK2 activity and to induce the phosphorylation of several CK2 substrates (either viral and host proteins). CK2 is also considered an emerging target for neurological diseases, inflammation and autoimmune disorders, diverse ophthalmic pathologies, diabetes, and obesity. In addition, CK2 activity has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, as cardiac ischemia–reperfusion injury, atherosclerosis, and cardiac hypertrophy. The hypothesis of considering CK2 inhibition for cystic fibrosis therapies has been also entertained for many years. Moreover, psychiatric disorders and syndromes due to CK2 mutations have been recently identified. On these bases, CK2 is emerging as an increasingly attractive target in various fields of human medicine, with the advantage that several very specific and effective inhibitors are already available. Here, we review the literature on CK2 implication in different human pathologies and evaluate its potential as a pharmacological target in the light of the most recent findings.","Borgo, Christian; D’Amore, Claudio; Sarno, Stefania; Salvi, Mauro; Ruzzene, Maria",Signal Transduct Target Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33994545/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-021-00567-7,476
656540,Managing the pandemic from the radiology department’s point of view,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Histone acetylation is a ubiquitous and reversible post-translational modification in eukaryotes and prokaryotes that is co-regulated by histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC). HAT activity is important for the modification of chromatin structure in eukaryotic cells, affecting gene transcription and thereby playing a crucial regulatory role in plant development. Comprehensive analyses of HAT genes have been performed in Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, barley, grapes, tomato, litchi and Zea mays, but comparable identification and analyses have not been conducted in wheat (Triticum aestivum). RESULTS: In this study, 31 TaHATs were identified and divided into six groups with conserved gene structures and motif compositions. Phylogenetic analysis was performed to predict functional similarities between Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa and Triticum aestivum HAT genes. The TaHATs appeared to be regulated by cis-acting elements such as LTR and TC-rich repeats. The qRT–PCR analysis showed that the TaHATs were differentially expressed in multiple tissues. The TaHATs in expression also responded to temperature changes, and were all significantly upregulated after being infected by barley streak mosaic virus (BSMV), Chinese wheat mosaic virus (CWMV) and wheat yellow mosaic virus (WYMV). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that TaHATs may have specific roles in the response to viral infection and provide a basis for further study of TaHAT functions in T. aestivum plant immunity.

656676,The impact of the Covid-19 lockdown on the experiences and feeding practices of new mothers in the UK: Preliminary data from the COVID-19 New Mum Study,2020-10-07,"The morbidity, mortality, and blistering pace of transmission of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to an unprecedented worldwide health crisis. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease produced by SARS-CoV-2 infection, is remarkable for persistent, severe respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation that places considerable strain on critical care resources. Because recovery from COVID-19–associated respiratory failure can be prolonged, tracheostomy may facilitate patient management and optimize the use of mechanical ventilators. Several important considerations apply to plan tracheostomies for COVID-19–infected patients. After performing a literature review of tracheostomies during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreaks, we synthesized important learning points from these experiences and suggested an approach for perioperative teams involved in these procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Multidisciplinary teams should be involved in decisions regarding timing and appropriateness of the procedure. As the theoretical risk of disease transmission is increased during aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs), stringent infectious precautions are warranted. Personal protective equipment (PPE) should be available and worn by all personnel present during tracheostomy. The number of people in the room should be limited to those absolutely necessary. Using the most experienced available operators will minimize the total time that staff is exposed to an infectious aerosolized environment. An approach that secures the airway in the safest and quickest manner will minimize the time any part of the airway is open to the environment. Deep neuromuscular blockade (train-of-four ratio = 0) will facilitate surgical exposure and prevent aerosolization due to patient movement or coughing. For percutaneous tracheostomies, the bronchoscopist should be able to reintubate if needed. Closed-loop communication must occur at all times among members of the team. If possible, after tracheostomy is performed, waiting until the patient is virus-free before changing the cannula or downsizing may reduce the chances of health care worker infection. Tracheostomies in COVID-19 patients present themselves as extremely high risk for all members of the procedural team. To mitigate risk, systematic meticulous planning of each procedural step is warranted along with strict adherence to local/institutional protocols.","Gosling, Andre F.; Bose,, Somnath; Gomez, Ernest; Parikh,, Mihir; Cook, Charles; Sarge, Todd; Shaefi, Shahzad; Leibowitz, Akiva",Anesth Analg,https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0000000000005009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32459668/,476

OBJECTIVES: To measure the association of closures and restrictions with aggregate mobility and the association of mobility with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections and to characterize community spread of COVID-19. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study used aggregated anonymized mobility data from smartphone users in Nigeria who opted to provide location history (from a pool of up to 40 million individuals) collected between February 27 and July 21, 2020. The analyzed data included daily counts of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and daily changes in aggregate mobility across 6 categories: retail and recreation, grocery and pharmacy, parks, transit stations, workplaces, and residential. Closures and restrictions were initiated on March 30, 2020, and partially eased on May 4, 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Interrupted time series were used to measure associations of closures and restrictions with aggregate mobility. Negative binomial regression was used to evaluate associations between confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and mobility categories. Averted infections were estimated by subtracting cumulative confirmed infections from estimated infections assuming no closures and restrictions. RESULTS: Closures and restrictions had negative associations with mean change in daily aggregate mobility in retail and recreation (–46.87 [95% CI, –55.98 to –37.76] percentage points; P < .001), grocery and pharmacy (–28.95 [95% CI, –40.12 to –17.77] percentage points; P < .001), parks (–43.59 [95% CI, –49.89 to –37.30] percentage points; P < .001), transit stations (–47.44 [95% CI, –56.70 to –38.19] percentage points; P < .001), and workplaces (–53.07 [95% CI, –67.75 to –38.39] percentage points; P < .001) and a positive association with mobility in residential areas (24.10 [95% CI, 19.14 to 29.05] percentage points; P < .001). Most of these changes reversed after closures and restrictions were partially eased (retail and recreation: 14.63 [95% CI, 10.95 to 18.30] percentage points; P < .001; grocery and pharmacy: 15.29 [95% CI, 10.90 to 19.67] percentage points; P < .001; parks: 6.48 [95% CI, 3.98 to 8.99] percentage points; P < .001; transit stations: 17.93 [95% CI, 14.03 to 21.83] percentage points; P < .001; residential: –5.59 [95% CI, –9.08 to –2.09] percentage points; P = .002). Additionally, every percentage point increase in aggregate mobility was associated with higher incidences of SARS-CoV-2 infection in residential areas (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.03 [95% CI, 1.00 to 1.07]; P = .04), transit stations (IRR, 1.02 [95% CI, 1.00 to 1.03]; P = .008), and workplaces (IRR, 1.01 [95% CI, 1.00 to 1.02]; P = .04). Lastly, closures and restrictions may have been associated with averting up to 5.8 million SARS-CoV-2 infections over the study period. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study, closures and restrictions had significant associations with aggregate mobility and were associated with decreased SARS-CoV-2 infections. These findings suggest that future anticontagion measures need better infection control and contact tracing in residential areas, transit stations, and workplaces.","Erim, Daniel O.; Oke, Gbemisola A.; Adisa, Akinyele O.; Odukoya, Oluwakemi; Ayo-Yusuf, Olalekan A.; Erim, Theodora Nawa; Tsafa, Tina N.; Meremikwu, Martin M.; Agaku, Israel T.",JAMA Netw Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33471117/; https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.32101,476

EV71 epidemics have been reported in Hong Kong in recent years, and yet the genetic information of EV71 strains circulating in our locality is limited. The objective of this study was to investigate the genetic evolution of these EV71 isolates in Hong Kong over a 7-year period. METHODS: Twenty-two EV71 isolates from Hong Kong during 2004–2010 were included for phylogenetic analysis using partial VP2-VP3, 2C and 3D regions. Eight EV71 strains were selected for complete genome sequencing and recombination analysis. RESULTS: Among the 22 EV71 isolates, 20 belonged to subgenotype C4 and 2 belonged to subgenotype C2 based on the phylogenetic analysis of partial VP2-VP3, 2C and 3D gene regions. Phylogenetic, similarity plot and bootscan analyses using complete genome sequences of seven EV71 isolates of subgenotype C4 supported that the “double-recombinant” strains of subgenotype C4 persistently circulating in Hong Kong should belong to a newly proposed genotype D. Further analysis revealed two clusters, subgenotypes C4b and C4a (proposed genotypes D1a and D1b respectively), with “genotype D1b” strains being predominant in recent years in Hong Kong. A distinct lineage of EV71 subgenotype C2 has emerged in Hong Kong in 2008. The evolutionary rate of EV71 was 3.1 × 10(-3) nucleotide substitutions per site per year similar to that of other enterovirus, such as EV68, but was relatively lower than those of echovirus 30 and poliovirus. Molecular clock analysis using VP1 gene dated the time to the most recent common ancestor of all EV71 genotypes to 1900s, while the EV71 “double-recombinant” strains of “genotype D” were detected as early as 1998. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the molecular basis for proposing a new “genotype D” of EV71 and assigning a discrete lineage of subgenotype C2. EV71 strains of “genotype D” have been circulating in Hong Kong for over 7 years, with “genotype D1b” being predominant.","Yip, Cyril CY; Lau, Susanna KP; Lo, Janice YC; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Woo, Patrick CY; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Virol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23822185/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-10-222,476

Surprisingly, a broad range of symptoms has been reported since COVID-19 emergence. Individual variations in susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 can be due to non-genetic and genetic factors. Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is an inherited condition that is associated with an increased risk of liver and lung diseases which may increase susceptibility to COVID-19 infection. At the same time, there could be a possibility of developing non-hereditary AATD. DISCUSSION: In addition to some evidence showing the role of vitamin D deficiency in COVID-19 pathology, it has been recognized that there is a biological link between AAT and vitamin D. Therefore, here we offer a new perspective that lower vitamin D levels in COVID-19 patients can cause acquired AATD that provide a condition with more disease severity and a higher risk of death. As a consequence, COVID-19 individuals with vitamin D deficiency may have a higher risk of morbidity and mortality. CONCLUSION: Therefore, early vitamin D and AAT assessments and optimal interventions could be helpful to prevent severe COVID-19 outcomes.","Shimi, Ghazaleh; Zand, Hamid",Inflamm Res,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00011-021-01456-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33740066/,476

A total of 100 COVID-19 patients diagnosed by nucleic acid test and chest CT examination in our hospital were collected in this study. They were divided into 2 groups: non-severe group (mild and moderate patients, n = 57 cases), and severe group (severe and critical patients, n = 43 cases) based on the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (Trial Version 7) published by the World Health Organization (WHO). The general clinical data, blood routine indexes, cellular immune and humoral immune function test indexes, and the composition of hospitalization costs of the two groups of patients were collected and analyzed. The results showed that the average age, proportion of males, smoking history, and the number and proportion of patients in the non-severe group were smaller than those in the severe group (P < 0.05); the severe group had significantly more shortness of breath patients than the non-severe group (P < 0.05). Compared with the non-severe group, the number of white blood cells (WBC), the number and proportion of neutrophils, and the count of neutrophils/lymphocytes in the severe group increased obviously (P < 0.05), and the number of lymphocytes and the proportion of monocytes decreased dramatically (P < 0.05); the number and proportion of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and CD19+ in the severe group were much lower in contrast to those in the non-severe group (P < 0.05), while the ratio of CD4+/CD8+ was greatly higher in contrast to that of non-severe patients (P < 0.05). Compared with the non-severe group, the bed fee, laboratory test fee, diagnosis fee, and medicine fee of the severe group were increased observably (P < 0.05). The changes in hospitalization cost of patients in the severe group was related to bed fees, laboratory fees, and expenses of proprietary Chinese medicines, while the hospitalization cost of patients in the severe group was related to bed fees, laboratory fees, and examination fees. The results revealed that elderly COVID-19 patients with basic diseases were prone to develop severe disease, immune cell depletion may be one of the reasons for the development of severe patients, and the medical insurance policy greatly reduced the hospitalization costs of COVID-19 patients.","Zhao, Jie; Yao, Yuan; Lai, Shaoyang; Zhou, Xuan",Results Phys,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211379721000164; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33527070/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211379721000164?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rinp.2021.103829,476

661444,Determinants of COVID-19 Incidence and Mortality in the US: Spatial Analysis,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been going on for over a year and has reemerged in several regions. Therefore, understanding the covertness of COVID-19 is critical to more precisely estimating the pandemic size, especially the population of hidden carriers (those with very mild or no symptoms). METHODS: A stochastic dynamic model was proposed to capture the transmission mechanism of COVID-19 and to depict the covertness of COVID-19. The proposed model captured unique features of COVID-19, changes in the diagnosis criteria, and escalating containment measures. RESULTS: The model estimated that, for the epidemic in Wuhan, 79.8% (76.7%–82.7%) of the spread was caused by hidden carriers. The overall lab-confirmation rate in Wuhan up until March 8, 2020 was 0.17 (0.15–0.19). The diagnostic rate among patients with significant symptoms went up to 0.82 on March 8, 2020 from 0.43 on January 1, 2020 with escalating containment measures and nationwide medical supports. The probability of resurgence could be as high as 0.72 if containment measures were lifted after zero new reported (lab-confirmed or clinically confirmed) cases in a consecutive period of 14 days. This probability went down to 0.18 and 0.01 for measures lifted after 30 and 60 days, respectively. DISCUSSION: Consistent with the cases detected in Wuhan in mid-May, 2020, this study suggests that much of the COVID-19 pandemic is underreported and highly covert, which suggests that strict measures must be enforced continuously to contain the spread of the pandemic.","You, Chong; Gai, Xin; Zhang, Yuan; Zhou, Xiaohua",China CDC Wkly,https://doi.org/10.46234/ccdcw2021.048; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34595036/,476

Applying this algorithm to data from Greece, we extend it to the case of two subpopulations, namely, those consisting of individuals below and above 40 years of age. After supplementing the Greek data for deaths with the data for the number of individuals reported to be infected by SARS-CoV-2, we estimated the effect on deaths and infections in the case that the easing of the lockdown measures is different for these two subpopulations. We found that if the lockdown measures are partially eased only for the young subpopulation, then the effect on deaths and infections is small.

Method : In 2018/2019, the glaucoma fellowship interviews were conducted in-person and one-to-one, whereas in 2020, interviews were virtual and multiple (interviewers)-to-one (candidate). We compared ranking ranges of interviewers within the same virtual room (WSR) and not within the same virtual room (NWSR) to assess the effect of this change on ranking variabilities. We also compared ranking categories (“accept,” “alternate,” and “pass”) agreements between in-person and virtual interviews to assess the effect of this change on ranking variabilities. Results : NWSR and WSR mean rankings differed by 1.33 (95% confidence interval difference 0.61 to 2.04, p = 0.0003), with WSR interviewers having less variability than NWSR pairs. The variability of in-person interviews and later virtual interviews showed no differences (weighted Kappa statistic 0.086 for 2018, 0.158 for 2019, and 0.101 for 2020; p < 0.05 for all years). The overall least attractive candidate has the lowest variability; the most attractive candidate has the second lowest variability. Conclusion: Grouping interviewers decreased ranking variabilities, while a change from in-person to virtual interview format did not increase the ranking variabilities.","Chang, Ta Chen; Hodapp, Elizabeth A.; Parrish, Richard K.; Grajewski, Alana L.; Gedde, Steven J.; Lee, Richard K.; Wellik, Sarah R.; Junk, Anna K.; Vazquez, Luis; Swaminathan, Swarup S.; Bitrian, Elena; Rothman, Adam L.; Vanner, Elizabeth A.",Res Sq,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34013249/; https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-415697/v1,476

To work as a currency, it must be stable or be backed by a government. In this paper, we show that the volatility of Bitcoin prices is extreme and almost 10 times higher than the volatility of major exchange rates (US dollar against the euro and the yen). The excess volatility even adversely affects its potential role in portfolios. Our analysis implies that Bitcoin cannot function as a medium of exchange and has only limited use as a risk-diversifier. In contrast, we use the deflationary design of Bitcoin as a theoretical basis and demonstrate that Bitcoin displays store of value characteristics over long horizons.","Baur, Dirk G.; Dimpfl, Thomas",Empir Econ,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00181-020-01990-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33424101/,476

Many college students were told to leave campus at spring break and to complete the semester remotely. This study evaluates effects of this disruption on student well-being. Measures of psychological symptoms, perceived stress, and alcohol use during the pandemic were completed by 148 students in spring 2020 and 352 students in fall 2020 at a university in the southeastern U.S. Results from both cohorts were compared to 240 students who completed the same measures in the fall 2019 semester. Participants in spring 2020 reported more mood disorder symptoms, perceived stress, and alcohol use than did pre-pandemic participants and worry about COVID-19 was negatively associated with well-being. By fall 2020 symptoms had largely returned to pre-pandemic levels. In general, White students reported a greater effect of the pandemic on well-being than did African American students. Young adults appear to be less vulnerable to the most serious medical complications associated with COVID-19 but nonetheless experience psychological effects from the pandemic. Universities and practitioners who work with college students can help young adults manage their symptoms and avoid behaviors like risky alcohol use when confronted with stressors such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Charles, Nora E.; Strong, Stephanie J.; Burns, Lauren C.; Bullerjahn, Margaret R.; Serafine, Katherine M.",Psychiatry Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33482422/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165178121000032; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178121000032?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113706,476

The susceptible individ- uals are assumed to move stochastically from one place to another. The virus particle transmission rate is assumed to obey the Eyring rate process theory and also controlled by how much free volume available in a system. The transmission process is considered to be a sequential chemical reaction, and the concentrations or fractions of four epidemiological compartments, the susceptible, the exposed, the infected, and the removed, can be derived and calculated. The obtained equations show that the basic reproduction number, R0, is not a constant, dependent on the volume frac- tion of virus particles, virus particle size, and virus particle packing structure, the energy barrier associated with susceptible individuals, and environment temperature. The developed models are applied to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) transmission and make predictions on peak time, peak infected, and R0.

664817,Adaptation of international coronavirus disease 2019 and breast cancer guidelines to local context,2021-01-24,"BACKGROUND: Apolipoprotein D (ApoD) is a member of the lipocalin family known to transport small hydrophobic ligands. A major site of ApoD expression in mice is the central nervous system where evidence suggests that it plays a protective role. Gene expression of ApoD was reported in bone-forming osteoblasts but its impact on bone metabolism remains undocumented. METHODS: We compared basic bone parameters of ApoD(−/−) (null) and transgenic (tg) mice to wild-type (wt) littermates through microCT and histochemistry, as well as ApoD expression and secretion in osteoblasts under various culture conditions through real-time PCR and immunoblotting. RESULTS: ApoD-null females displayed progressive bone loss with aging, resulting in a 50% reduction in trabecular bone volume and a 23% reduction in cortical bone volume by 9 months of age. Only cortical bone volume was significantly reduced in ApoD-null males by an average of 24%. Histochemistry indicated significantly higher osteoblast surface and number of osteoclasts in femora from ApoD-null females. ApoD gene expression was confirmed in primary cultures of bone marrow mesenchymal cells (MSC), with higher expression levels in MSC from females compared to males. ApoD-null MSC exhibited impaired proliferation and differentiation potentials. Moreover, exogenous ApoD partially rescued the osteogenic potential of null MSC, which were shown to readily uptake the protein from media. ApoD expression was upregulated under low proliferation conditions, by contact inhibition and osteoblastic differentiation in MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cells. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that ApoD influences bone metabolism in mice in a gender-specific manner, potentially through an auto-/paracrine pathway.","Martineau, Corine; Najyb, Ouafa; Signor, Céline; Rassart, Éric; Moreau, Robert",Metabolism,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.metabol.2016.05.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27506732/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0026049516300221; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0026049516300221,476

Soon after the pandemic was recognized by epidemiologists, a group of biologists comprising the ARTIC Network, has devised a multiplexed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol and primer set for targeted whole-genome amplification of SARS-CoV-2. The ARTIC primer set amplifies 98 amplicons, which are separated only in two PCRs, across a nearly entire viral genome. The original primer set and protocol showed a fairly small amplification bias when clinical samples with relatively high viral loads were used. However, as sample’s viral load become low, rapid decrease in abundances of several amplicons were seen. In this report, we will show that dimer formations between some primers are the major cause of coverage bias in the multiplex PCR. Based on this, we propose 12 alternative primers in total in the ARTIC primer set that were predicted to be involved in 14 primer interactions. The resulting primer set, version N1 (NIID-1), exhibits improved overall coverage compared to the ARTIC Network’s original (V1) and modified (V3) primer set.","Itokawa, Kentaro; Sekizuka, Tsuyoshi; Hashino, Masanori; Tanaka, Rina; Kuroda, Makoto",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0239403; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32946527/,476

Objective By investigating this relationship through a multi-omics approach, we sought to ascertain whether patients with skin conditions are more susceptible to COVID-19. Methods We conducted an epidemiological study and then compared gene expression across nine different inflammatory skin conditions and SARS-CoV-2 infected bronchial epithelial cell lines, then performed a GWAS trans-disease meta-analysis between COVID-19 susceptibility and two skin diseases (psoriasis and atopic dermatitis). Results Skin conditions, including psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, increase the risk of COVID-19 (OR=1.55, p=1.4x10 -9 ), but decrease the risk of mechanical ventilation (OR=0.22, p=8.5x10 -5 ). We observed significant overlap in gene expression between the infected normal bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) and inflammatory skin diseases, such as psoriasis, and atopic dermatitis. For genes that are commonly induced in both the SARS-CoV-2 infection and skin diseases, there are four S100 family members located in the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC), and we also identified the ‘IL-17 signaling pathway’ (p=4.9x10 -77 ) as one of the most significantly enriched pathways. Furthermore, a shared genome-wide significant locus in the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC) was identified between psoriasis and SARS-CoV-2 infection, with the lead marker being a significant eQTL for S100A12 (p=3.3x10 -7 ). Conclusion Together our findings suggest association between inflammatory skin conditions and higher risk of COVID-19, but with less severe course, and highlight shared components involved in anti-COVID19 immune response.","Patrick, Matthew T.; Zhang, Haihan; Wasikowski, Rachael; Prens, Errol P.; Weidinger, Stephan; Gudjonsson, Johann E.; Elder, James T.; He, Kevin; Tsoi, Lam C.",J Allergy Clin Immunol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2021.01.006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674921000841; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33485957/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674921000841?v=s5,476

In this paper, we show how a shift in perspective has impacted our lab's ability to successfully transition to virtual work during the COVID-19 shut-down. This begins by recognizing that any lab that relies on local communities to engage in human research is itself a community organization. From this, we introduce a community-engaged lab model, and explain how it works using our own activities during the pandemic as an example. To begin, we introduce the vocabulary of mission-driven community organizations and show how we applied the key ideas of mission, vision, and culture to discussions of our own lab's identity. We contrast the community-engaged lab model with a traditional bi-directional model of recruitment from and dissemination to communities and describe how the community-engaged model can be used to reframe these and other ordinary lab activities. Our activities during the pandemic serve as a case study: we formed new community partnerships, engaged with child “citizen-scientists” in online research, and opened new avenues of virtual programming. One year later, we see modest but quantifiable impact of this approach: a return to pre-pandemic diversity in our samples, new engagement opportunities for trainees, and new sustainable partnerships. We end by discussing the promise and limitations of the community-engaged lab model for the future of developmental research.","Liu, Judy; Partington, Scott; Suh, Yeonju; Finiasz, Zoe; Flanagan, Teresa; Kocher, Deanna; Kiely, Richard; Kortenaar, Michelle; Kushnir, Tamar",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34489817/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.715914,476

We conducted a real-world retrospective cohort study in 688 primary-to-tertiary medical units in Mexico City; 395,343 patients were evaluated for suspected COVID-19 between February 24 and September 14, 2020. All patients with a positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 (n=137,012) were included; those receiving unspecified antivirals (n=137), excluded, and groups of antivirals with <30 patients (n=20), eliminated. Survival and mortality risk analyses were done for patients receiving antivirals, antibiotics, both, or none (exposition groups). 136,855 patients were analyzed; mean age 44.2 (SD:16.8) years; 51.3% were men. 16.6% received an antiviral (3%), antibiotic (10%), or both (3.6%). More symptomatic patients received antivirals and antibiotics more often. Antivirals studied were Oseltamivir (n=8414), Amantadine (n=319), Lopinavir-Ritonavir (n=100), Rimantadine (n=61), Zanamivir (n=39), and Acyclovir (n=36). Survival with antivirals (73.7%, P<.001) and antibiotics (85.8%, P<.001) was lower than no antiviral/antibiotic (93.6%) in the general population. Increased risk of death was observed with antivirals in ambulatory (HR=4.7, 95%CI:3.94-5.62) and non-critical (HR=2.03, 95%CI:1.86-2.21) patients; no benefit in hospitalized and critical patients. Oseltamivir was associated with increased mortality in the general population (HR=1.72, 95%CI:1.61-1.84), ambulatory (HR=4.79, 95%CI:4.01-5.75), non-critical (HR=2.05, 95%CI:1.88-2.23), and pregnancy (HR=8.35, 95%CI:1.77-39.30).

In conclusion, oseltamivir was associated with increased mortality or no benefit in all groups. Common antivirals for COVID-19 should be avoided.

METHODS: A randomized, parallel-group, controlled trial was undertaken in patients aged 65 and above who were admitted to a tertiary hospital geriatric unit from January 1, 2016 to June 30, 2018 for an acute non-respiratory illness. Participants were randomized by to receive either a multi-component intervention (consisting of reverse Trendelenburg position, dysphagia screening, oral care and vaccinations), or usual care. The outcome measures were the proportion of patients who developed hospital-acquired pneumonia during hospitalisation, and mean time from randomization to the next hospitalisation due to respiratory infections in 1 year. RESULTS: A total of 123 participants (median age, 85; 43.1% male) were randomized, (n = 59) to intervention group and (n = 64) to control group. The multi-component interventions did not significantly reduce the incidence of hospital-acquired pneumonia but did increase the mean time to next hospitalisation due to respiratory infection (11.5 months vs. 9.5 months; P = 0.049), and reduced the risk of hospitalisation in 1 year (18.6% vs. 34.4%; P = 0.049). Implementation of multi-component interventions increased diagnoses of oropharyngeal dysphagia (35.6% vs. 20.3%; P < 0.001) and improved the influenza (54.5% vs 17.2%; P < 0.001) and pneumococcal vaccination rates (52.5% vs. 20.3%; P < 0.001).

669587,"Covid-19: Cummings, Johnson, Hancock, and a maelstrom of avoidable harm",2021,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Compounding pre-existing diverse vulnerabilities, pet owners living with (dis)abilities are expected to confront more challenges than their peers without (dis)abilities. However, there is a paucity of literature investigating COVID-19-specific impacts on access to veterinary medical and behavioral services from the lens of persons with (dis)abilities (PWDs). Through semi-structured in-depth interviews, this study highlights PWDs’ difficulties, three-fold: (1) COVID-19 has worsened PWDs’ already precarious financial capacity to pay for veterinary services, (2) existing assistance and support programs do not effectively address PWDs’ unique requirements to support their companion animals’ health needs, and (3) public health protocols triggered public transportation challenges for PWDs who must now also adapt to complicated curbside services. Building PWD-driven social assistance and support programs would help reduce these challenges and promote health and well-being for both PWDs and their companion animals. ABSTRACT: The research aims to explore COVID-19 health and safety protocol impacts on companion animal guardians living with (dis)abilities relating to veterinary medical and behavioral service access. The COVID-19 global public health crisis has impacted almost all international communities; however, vulnerable and marginalized groups have been disproportionately affected. Within the human–companion animal domain, COVID-19-driven societal impacts (e.g., social, health, and economic) not only boomed with new companion animal guardians, but also negatively influenced guardians’ access to veterinary services. Although studies have examined guardian-related COVID-19-specific challenges, there is a paucity of concentration on vulnerable populations, such as persons with disabilities (PWDs). Responding to this research deficit, this study recruited twelve companion animal guardians to participate in semi-structured in-depth interviews, and eight (67%) of the twelve participants self-identified as PWDs. From a PWD perspective, this research reveals three pandemic-triggered primary barriers, preventing PWDs from pursuing veterinary services: (1) service affordability, (2) assistance program feasibility, and (3) veterinary service accessibility. This article argues that PWD-driven approaches could improve existing assistance and support programs to address PWDs’ unique requirements, promoting a healthy human–animal bond.","Wu, Haorui; Bains, Ravinder Sarah; Morris, Amy; Morales, Celeste",Animals (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34438816/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ani11082359,476

The results show that air quality improved significantly during the lockdown phases, with the most significant changes occurring in the transportation and industrially dominated areas. A pronounced decline in PM(2.5 and) PM(10) up to 63% and 58%, respectively, was observed during the lockdown compared to the pre-lockdown period in 2020. When compared to 2018 and 2019, they were lower by up to 51% and 61%, respectively, dropping by 56% during unlock. Some pollutants (NOx and CO) dropped significantly during lockdown, while SO(2) and O(3) declined only slightly. Moreover, when compared between the different phases of lockdown, the maximum decline for most of the pollutants and air quality index occurred during the lockdown phase 1; thus, this period was used to report the COVID-19 baseline threshold values (CBT; threshold value is the upper limit of baseline variation). Of the various statistical methods used median + 2 median absolute deviation (mMAD) was most suitable, indicating CBT values of 143 and 75 ug/m(3) for PM(10) and PM(2.5), respectively. This results although preliminary, but it gives a positive indication that temporary lockdown can be considered as a boon to mitigate the damage we have done to the environment. Also, this baseline levels can be helpful as a first line of information to set future target limits or to develop effiective management policies for achieving better air quality in urban centres like Delhi.

A 2015 pilot study demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of using medical and nursing students to administer DMPA-SC (the subcutaneous injection) among other methods at the community level. The more far-reaching discovery was the potential of clinically trained students to increase access to low-cost contraception in the short-run, while improving the quality of service delivery for future generations of healthcare providers. Scale-up involved integrating the family planning curriculum into the training of nursing students, including classroom instruction in contraceptive technology and service delivery, coupled with a year-long field practicum in which students offered a range of contraceptive methods during intermittent outreach events, door-to-door distribution or sales from their homes. Starting in 2015, a multi-agency team consisting of an international non-governmental organizations (NGO), several Ministry of Health directorates and a local NGO used the ExpandNet/WHO framework to guide this scale-up. This article details the nine steps in the scale-up process. It presents results on increases in contraceptive uptake, feedback from participating nursing school personnel and the employment experience of the graduates from this programme. Between 2015 and 2019, the family planning curriculum was incorporated into 30.8% of the 477 nursing schools in 7 of the 26 provinces in the DRC. Students delivered 461 769 couple-years of protection (the key output indicator for family planning programmes). Nursing school personnel were strongly favourable to the approach, although they needed continued support to adequately implement a set of additional interventions related to the service delivery components of the new training approach. Post-graduation, only 40.1% of graduates had paid employment (reflecting the staggering unemployment in the DRC); among those, over 90% used their family planning training in their work. We describe the multiple challenges faced during the scale-up process and in planning for expansion to additional schools.","Ntabona, Alexis; Binanga, Arsene; Bapitani, Mr Désiré Josué; Bobo, Beatrice; Mukengeshayi, Bitshi; Akilimali, Pierre; Kalong, Gloria; Mujani, Zenon; Hernandez, Julie; Bertrand, Jane T",Health Policy Plan,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34009259/; https://doi.org/10.1093/heapol/czab014,476

This study investigated the relationship between economic stressors and mental health symptoms among Bangladeshi rehabilitation professionals. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 420 rehabilitation professionals between July 2020 and October 2020. Economic stressors were measured using Economic Hardship Questionnaire, Financial Threat Scale, and Financial Well-Being Scale. Mental health symptoms were measured using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to find associated factors on mental health problems after adjusting confounders. RESULTS: Among 420 rehabilitation professionals 62.1% were male, 38.6% were post-graduated and 75% were in practice. The overall prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress was 51.0%, 58.6%, and 33.6%, respectively. The multivariable regression analysis indicated that without a high professional degree, lack of opportunity to practice, and loss of income were the associated factors for mental health symptoms. The modelling of the structural equation showed that financial threat is significantly associated with mental health symptoms. CONCLUSION: During the era of COVID-19, a high prevalence of mental health symptoms was observed among rehabilitation professionals. To minimize the burden of mental health, we recommend that all rehabilitation organizations and the government come together to create equal opportunities to practice and enable individuals to obtain high professional degrees.","Ali, Mohammad; Uddin, Zakir; Hossain, Ahmed",Heliyon,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e06715; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33898834/,476

However, the mechanism by which the intolerance of COVID-19-related uncertainty (COVID-19 IU) affects negative emotions in adolescents remains unclear. This study explored the underlying mechanism from COVID-19 IU to negative emotions using a moderated mediation model in adolescents. In total, 3037 teenagers completed a cross-sectional survey including measures of COVID-19 IU, risk perception, social exclusion, perceived efficacy, and negative emotions. The results showed that COVID-19 IU positively predicted negative emotions and that risk perception and social exclusion mediated this relationship. In addition, both the direct effect of COVID-19 IU on negative emotions and the mediating effect of risk perception on this relationship were moderated by perceived efficacy; in particular, COVID-19 IU had a greater impact on negative emotions among adolescents with lower levels of perceived efficacy. These findings suggest that COVID-19 IU is closely associated with negative emotions among adolescents and that effective measures should be taken to enable adolescents to improve their perceived efficacy and develop a reasonable perception of risk, help them eliminate the stigma of the disease, and strengthen their connections with society.","Li, Qi; Luo, Ronglei; Zhang, Xiaoya; Meng, Guangteng; Dai, Bibing; Liu, Xun",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18062864; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33799731/,476

OBJECTIVE: By way of illustration, the microbial metabolite of aromatic amino acid tryptophan, a biogenic amine tryptamine inducing neurodegeneration in cell and animal models, also induces necrosis. METHODS: This report includes analysis of COVID-19 positivity by zip codes in Florida and relation of the positivity to population density, possible effect of ecological and social factors on spread of COVID-19, autopsy analysis of COVID-19 cases from around the world, serum metabolomics analysis, and evaluation of autoantigenome related to COVID-19. RESULTS: In the present estimations, COVID-19 positivity percent per zip code population varied in Florida from 4.65% to 44.3% (February 2021 data). COVID-19 analysis is partially included in my book Microbial Metabolism and Disease (2021). The autoantigenome related to COVID-19 is characterized by alterations in protein biosynthesis proteins including aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Protein biosynthesis alteration is a feature of Alzheimer’s disease. Serum metabolomics of COVID-19 positive patients show alteration in shikimate pathway metabolism, which is associated with the presence of Alzheimer’s disease-associated human gut bacteria.

The health needs of these countries’ populations are unmet because there is a shortage in drug research and development, as well as a lack of access to essential drugs. This health disparity is especially problematic for diseases associated with poverty, namely neglected tropical diseases and microbial infections. Currently, the pharmaceutical landscape focuses on innovations determined by profit margins and intellectual property protection. To expand drug accessibility and catalyze research and development for neglected diseases, a team of researchers proposed the Health Impact Fund as a potential solution. However, the fund is predominantly considering partnerships with pharmaceutical giants in high-income countries. This commentary explores the limitations and benefits in partnering with pharmaceutical companies based in Brazil, Russia, India, and China (BRIC), with the goal of expanding the Health Impact Fund’s vision to incorporate long-term, local partnerships. Identified limitations to a BRIC country partnership include lower levels of drug development expertise compared to their high-income pharmaceutical counterparts, and whether the Health Impact Fund and the participating stakeholders have the financial capability to assist in bringing a new drug to market. However, potential benefits include the creation of new incentives to fuel competitive local innovation, more equitable routes to drug discovery and development, and a product pipeline that could involve stakeholders in lower- and middle-income countries. Our commentary explores how partnership with pharmaceutical firms in BRIC countries might be advantageous for all: The Health Impact Fund, pharmaceutical companies in BRIC economies, and stakeholders in low- and middle- income countries.","Lee, Vivian Chia-Jou; Yao, Jacqueline; Zhang, William",Global Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34488801/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-021-00744-x,476

Lung function tests are also indispensable in evaluating the response to medical treatment, in monitoring patient respiratory and systemic pathologies, and in evaluating preoperative risk in cardiothoracic and major abdominal surgeries. However, lung function testing represents a potential route for COVID-19 transmission, due to the aerosol generated during the procedures and the concentration of patients with pulmonary diseases in lung function laboratories.

671752,Common and uncommon chest computed tomography findings at hospital admission with COVID-19 pneumonia,2020-09-16,"INTRODUCTION: Thrombosis occurs frequently in COVID-19. While the exact mechanism is unclear, 3 processes seem to play important roles in sepsis-related thrombosis and mortality: tissue factor expression on circulating monocytes and microparticles, hypercoagulability (increased clot firmness), and hypofibrinolysis. Rotational thromboelastometry is a point-of-care viscoelastic technique that uses the viscoelastic properties of blood to monitor coagulation. Using various assays, viscoelastometry could monitor this triad of changes in severely ill, COVID-19-positive patients. Similarly, with the increased incidence of coagulopathy, many patients are placed on anticoagulants, making management more difficult depending on the agents utilized. Viscoelastometry might also be used in these settings to monitor anticoagulation status and guide therapy, as it has in other areas. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case series of 6 patients with different stages of disease and different management plans. These cases occurred at the height of the pandemic in New York City, which limited testing abilities. We first discuss the idea of using the NaHEPTEM test as a marker of tissue factor expression in COVID-19. We then present cases where patients are on different anticoagulants and review how viscoelastometry might be used in a patient on anticoagulation with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: In a disease such as COVID-19, which has profound effects on hemostasis and coagulation, viscoelastometry may aid in patient triage, disease course monitoring, and anticoagulation management.","Katz, Daniel; Maher, Patrick; Getrajdman, Chloe; Hamburger, Joshua; Zhao, Shan; Madek, Jonathan; Bhatt, Himani; Levin, Matthew; Görlinger, Klaus",Transfus Med Hemother,https://doi.org/10.1159/000514486; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34177421/,476

To produce and provide safe, secure and nutritious food, consumers and food businesses must abide by a set of shared values known as food safety culture. In Nigeria, food safety culture is a complex subject due to Nigeria’s heterogeneous and diverse nature, as demonstrated by its over 250 ethnic groups. As Nigeria becomes more urbanized and incomes continue to fluctuate at robust rates, few Nigerians are conscious of food safety issues. In addition, oversight from government regulators around food safety require improvement. Public engagement in food safety issues has not witnessed a promising trajectory in recent years. In this article, we provide a review of the food safety culture in Nigeria and its role and influence on various cases of food safety issues in Nigeria. Of interest to this paper are studies exploring consumer and food handler perceptions and behavior regarding food safety. In addition, keen attention is devoted to areas that are in need of additional research to help address practical and on-the-ground challenges associated with Nigeria’s food safety practices.

Gammacoronaviruses were detected more often than deltacoronaviruses, with detection rates of 3.5% and 0.7%, respectively. Gammacoronaviruses were detected in birds belonging to six orders, including Anseriformes, Charadriiformes, Columbiformes, Galliformes, Gruiformes, and Passeriformes, indicating a relatively wide host range. Interestingly, this was the only coronavirus detected in Anseriformes (3.51%), while in Charadriiformes, the prevalence was 3.1%. The identified gammacoronaviruses belonged to the Igacovirus and Brangacovirus subgeneras. Most of these were igacoviruses and formed a common phylogenetic group with a Duck Coronavirus 2714 and two with an Avian Coronavirus/Avian Coronavirus9203, while the viruses from the pigeons formed a distinct “pigeon-like” group, not yet officially represented. The presence of deltacoronaviruses was detected in birds belonging to three orders, Charadriiformes, Galliformes, and Suliformes indicating a narrower host range. Most identified deltacoronaviruses belonged to the Buldecovirus subgenus, while only one belonged to Herdecovirus. Interestingly, the majority of buldecoviruses were identified in gulls, and they formed a distinct phylogenetic lineage not represented by any officially ratified virus species. Another separate group of buldecoviruses, also not represented by the official species, was formed by a virus identified in a common snipe. Only one identified buldecovirus (from common pheasant) formed a group with the ratified species Coronavirus HKU15. The results obtained indicate the high diversity of detected coronaviruses, and thus also the need to update their taxonomy (establishing new representative virus species).

673904,Uncertainty and COVID-19: how are we to respond?,2020-06-11,"The scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SR-B1), a high-density lipoprotein (HDL) receptor, is a membrane glycoprotein that mediates selective uptake of HDL-cholesterol and cholesterol ester (CE) into cells. SR-B1 is subject to posttranslational regulation; however, the underlying mechanisms still remain obscure. Here, we identified a novel SR-B1-interacting protein, GIPC1 (GAIP-interacting protein, C terminus 1) that interacts with SR-B1 and stabilizes SR-B1 by negative regulation of its proteasomal and lysosomal degradation pathways. The physiological interaction between SR-B1 and GIPC1 was supported by co-immunoprecipitation of wild-type and mutant GIPC1 constructs in SR-B1 ± GIPC1 overexpressing cells, in native liver cells, and in mouse liver tissues. Overexpression of GIPC1 increased endogenous SR-B1 protein levels, subsequently increasing selective HDL-cholesterol/CE uptake and cellular triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) levels, whereas silencing of GIPC1 in the mouse liver was associated with blunted hepatic SR-B1 levels, elevated plasma TG and TC, and attenuated hepatic TG and TC content. A positive correlation was identified between GIPC1 and SR-B1 expression, and both expressions of GIPC1 and SR-B1 from human liver samples were inversely correlated with body mass index (BMI) from human subjects. We therefore conclude that GIPC1 plays a key role in the stability and function of SR-B1 and can also effectively regulate hepatic lipid and cholesterol metabolism. These findings expand our knowledge of the regulatory roles of GIPC1 and suggest that GIPC1 exerts a major effect on cell surface receptors such as SR-B1 and its associated hepatic lipid and cholesterol metabolic processes.","Zhang, Ziyu; Zhou, Qian; Liu, Rui; Liu, Li; Shen, Wen-Jun; Azhar, Salman; Qu, Yan-Fu; Guo, Zhigang; Hu, Zhigang",J Biol Chem,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2021.100616; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33811857/,476

Systemic racism, including public perceptions about people who use opioids, inadequate substance abuse prevention and treatment efforts, heightened risks for COVID-19 exposure, and inadequate access to testing and health care, has contributed to the ongoing disparities underlying these health crises. Thus, the authors propose an integrative framework for conceptualizing the COVID-19, opioid use, and racism (COR) syndemic, with traumatic stress as a critical underpinning of this model.

Une enquête a été mise en place afin d’objectiver l’impact de la pandémie sur cette population spécifique. Matériels et méthodes Un web questionnaire a été proposé mi-avril 2020 à tous les établissements de santé (ES) publics ou privés. Les ES volontaires saisissent de manière hebdomadaire le nombre de nouveaux PES infectés et les décès attribuables. Un cas est défini comme tout salarié, symptomatique ou non, testé positif pour le SARS-CoV-2 par RT-PCR, ou par sérologie (à partir de juillet 2020) ou par test antigénique (à partir de novembre 2020) ou reconnu comme infecté par la cellule « COVID-19 » ou le référent infectiologue de l’ES. La région, le type d’ES, la catégorie professionnelle et le service sont également recueillis. Les proportions de PES infectés ont été estimées en rapportant le nombre de cas aux données de la Statistique annuelle des établissements de santé 2019. Résultats Plus de 1300 ES ont participé au moins une fois à l’enquête. Entre le 1er mars 2020 et le 29 mars 2021, 76 089 PES, correspondant à 8 % des PES exerçant dans les ES participants ont été infectés par le SARS-CoV2, avec 19 décès attribuables. Parmi ces PES, la majorité (72 %) étaient des soignants. La répartition hebdomadaire du nombre de cas montre 3 pics de contamination en mars, octobre 2020 et janvier 2021. Les 2 professions ayant déclaré le plus de cas étaient les infirmiers (24 % des cas) et les aides-soignants (21 % des cas). Les aides-soignants et les kinésithérapeutes rapportaient les plus grandes proportions de PES infectés, respectivement 9,5 % et 9,0 % que ce soit pendant la 1re vague ou la 2e vague. Les PES contaminés déclaraient principalement avoir travaillé dans des services de MCO (33 %) ou SSR/SLD (12 %). Des disparités régionales dans la proportion de PES infectés ont été observées. Conclusion Cette enquête met en évidence l’impact important de la pandémie parmi les PES, avec les mêmes tendances temporelles et géographiques qu’en population générale. Peu de pays rapportent ainsi une proportion de PES infectés estimée à l’échelle nationale. Les professions avec des contacts fréquents et prolongés avec les patients (aides-soignants, kinésithérapeutes) sont les plus touchées proportionnellement.

Many of the Chechen migrants settled in Europe where cultural, religious, and social differences compelled them to go through the daunting process of identity negotiation. Although most of the first-generation Chechen migrants managed to preserve their original identity, this was not always the case for their children. This article aims to identify the factors that determine the identity preferences of second-generation Chechens in Europe. The paper presents three cases which illustrate very different outcomes of the identity formation and negotiation processes.

675308,Of pathogens and party lines: Social conservatism positively associates with COVID-19 precautions among U.S. Democrats but not Republicans,2021-06-29,"INTRODUCTION: Fewer than half of all people in the USA have a documented advance care plan (ACP). Hospitalisation offers an opportunity for physicians to initiate ACP conversations. Despite expert recommendations, hospital-based physicians (hospitalists) do not routinely engage in these conversations, reserving them for the critically ill. The objective of this study is to test the effect of a novel behavioural intervention on the incidence of ACP conversations by hospitalists practicing at a stratified random sample of hospitals drawn from 220 US acute care hospitals staffed by a large, nationwide acute care physician practice with an ongoing ACP quality improvement initiative. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We developed Hopewell Hospitalist, a theory-based adventure video game, to modify physicians' attitudes towards ACP conversations and to increase their motivation for engaging in them. The planned study is a pragmatic stepped-wedge crossover phase III trial, testing the efficacy of Hopewell Hospitalist for increasing ACP conversations. We will randomise 40 hospitals to the month (step) in which they receive the intervention. We aim to recruit 30 hospitalists from up to eight hospitals each step to complete the intervention, playing Hopewell Hospitalist for at least 2 hours. The primary outcome is ACP billing for patients aged 65 and older managed by participating hospitalists. We hypothesise that the intervention will increase ACP billing in the quarter after dissemination, and have 80% power to detect a 1% absolute increase and 99% power to detect a 3.5% absolute increase. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Dartmouth’s Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects has approved the study protocol, which is registered on clinicaltrials.gov. We will disseminate the results through manuscripts and the trials website. Hopewell Hospitalist will be made available on the iOS Application Store for download, free of cost, at the conclusion of the trial.

675930,COVID‐19 and the Unequalizing Infrastructures of Financial Inclusion in Tamil Nadu,2021-08-16,"In 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic is characterized by global spread of several lineages with evidence for increased transmissibility. Russia is among the countries with the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, making it a potential hotspot for emergence of novel variants. Here, we show that among the globally significant variants of concern, B.1.1.7 (501Y.V1), B.1.351 (501Y.V2) or P.1 (501Y.V3), none have been sampled in Russia before January 2021. Instead, since summer 2020, the epidemic in Russia has been characterized by the spread of two lineages that are rare elsewhere: B.1.1.317 and a sublineage of B.1.1 including B.1.1.397 (hereafter, B.1.1.397+). In February-March 2021, these lineages reached frequencies of 26.9% (95% C.I.: 23.1%-31.1%) and 32.8% (95% C.I.28.6%-37.2%) respectively in Russia. Their frequency has increased in different parts of Russia. Together with the fact that these lineages carry several spike mutations of interest, this suggests that B.1.1.317 and B.1.1.397+ may be more transmissible than the previously predominant B.1.1, although there is no direct data on change in transmissibility. Comparison of frequency dynamics of lineages carrying subsets of characteristic mutations of B.1.1.317 and B.1.1.397+ suggests that, if indeed some of these mutations affect transmissibility, the transmission advantage of B.1.1.317 may be conferred by the (S:D138Y+S:S477N+S:A845S) combination; while the advantage of B.1.1.397+ may be conferred by the S:M153T change. On top of these lineages, in January 2021, B.1.1.7 emerged in Russia, reaching the frequency of 17.4% (95% C.I.: 12.0%-24.4%) in March 2021. Additionally, we identify three novel distinct lineages, AT.1, and two lineages prospectively named B.1.1.v1 and B.1.1.v2, that have started to spread, together reaching the frequency of 11.8% (95% C.I.: 7.5%-18.1%) in March 2021. These lineages carry combinations of several notable mutations, including the S:E484K mutation of concern, deletions at a recurrent deletion region of the spike glycoprotein (S:{Delta}140-142, S:{Delta}144 or S:{Delta}136-144), and nsp6:{Delta}106-108 (also known as ORF1a:{Delta}3675-3677). Community-based PCR testing indicates that these variants have continued to spread in April 2021, with the frequency of B.1.1.7 reaching 21.7% (95% C.I.: 12.3%-35.6%), and the joint frequency of B.1.1.v1 and B.1.1.v2, 15.2% (95% C.I.: 7.6%-28.2%). The combinations of mutations observed in B.1.1.317, B.1.1.397+, AT.1, B.1.1.v1 and B.1.1.v2 together with frequency increase of these lineages make them candidate variants of interest.","Klink, G.; Safina, K.

Nurse practitioner, medical, and pharmacy students participated in virtual patient contact, geriatric case-based learning, and team-based interprofessional development. We conducted pre-and post-outreach assessments with students and geriatric providers to determine the effects of this initiative. After participating in the 3-month outreach initiative, interprofessional students reported increased confidence in conducting outreach calls, participating in interdisciplinary team discussions, and reviewing geriatric cases. This student-led telephone-based outreach to older adults improved students' exposure to and confidence with interprofessional teamwork and geriatric medicine.

The basis for these reference values is unclear but one argument is that it should be based on the health opportunity costs of funding decisions. Empirical estimates of the marginal cost per unit of health produced by a healthcare system have been proposed to capture the health opportunity costs of new funding decisions. Based on a systematic search, we identified eight studies that have sought to estimate a reference value through empirical estimation of the marginal cost per unit of health produced by a healthcare system for England, Spain, Australia, The Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa and China. We review these eight studies to provide an overview of the key methodological approaches taken to estimate the marginal cost per unit of health produced by the healthcare system with the aim to help inform future estimates for additional countries. The lead author for each of these papers was invited to contribute to the current paper to ensure all the key methodological issues encountered were appropriately captured. These included consideration of the key variables required and their measurement, accounting for endogeneity of spending to health outcomes, the inclusion of lagged spending, discounting and future costs, the use of analytical weights, level of disease aggregation, expected duration of health gains, and modelling approaches to estimating mortality and morbidity effects of health spending. Subsequent research estimates for additional countries should (1) carefully consider the specific context and data available, (2) clearly and transparently report the assumptions made and include stakeholder perspectives on their appropriateness and acceptability, and (3) assess the sensitivity of the preferred central estimate to these assumptions.

Array-based methods have proven utility to detect in a single assay at a reasonable cost any microbe from the thousands that have been sequenced. METHODS: We designed a pan-Microbial Detection Array (MDA) to detect all known viruses (including phages), bacteria and plasmids and developed a novel statistical analysis method to identify mixtures of organisms from complex samples hybridized to the array. The array has broader coverage of bacterial and viral targets and is based on more recent sequence data and more probes per target than other microbial detection/discovery arrays in the literature. Family-specific probes were selected for all sequenced viral and bacterial complete genomes, segments, and plasmids. Probes were designed to tolerate some sequence variation to enable detection of divergent species with homology to sequenced organisms, and to have no significant matches to the human genome sequence. RESULTS: In blinded testing on spiked samples with single or multiple viruses, the MDA was able to correctly identify species or strains. In clinical fecal, serum, and respiratory samples, the MDA was able to detect and characterize multiple viruses, phage, and bacteria in a sample to the family and species level, as confirmed by PCR.

677715,Intraocular Pressure Telemetry for Managing Glaucoma during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-02-04,"BACKGROUND: Interferon inducible transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) have diverse roles, including the control of cell proliferation, promotion of homotypic cell adhesion, protection against viral infection, promotion of bone matrix maturation and mineralisation, and mediating germ cell development. Most IFITMs have been well characterised in human and mouse but little published data exists for other animals. This study characterised IFITMs in two distantly related marsupial species, the Australian tammar wallaby and the South American grey short-tailed opossum, and analysed the phylogeny of the IFITM family in vertebrates. RESULTS: Five IFITM paralogues were identified in both the tammar and opossum. As in eutherians, most marsupial IFITM genes exist within a cluster, contain two exons and encode proteins with two transmembrane domains. Only two IFITM genes, IFITM5 and IFITM10, have orthologues in both marsupials and eutherians. IFITM5 arose in bony fish and IFITM10 in tetrapods. The bone-specific expression of IFITM5 appears to be restricted to therian mammals, suggesting that its specialised role in bone production is a recent adaptation specific to mammals. IFITM10 is the most highly conserved IFITM, sharing at least 85% amino acid identity between birds, reptiles and mammals and suggesting an important role for this presently uncharacterised protein. CONCLUSIONS: Like eutherians, marsupials also have multiple IFITM genes that exist in a gene cluster. The differing expression patterns for many of the paralogues, together with poor sequence conservation between species, suggests that IFITM genes have acquired many different roles during vertebrate evolution.","Hickford, Danielle; Frankenberg, Stephen; Shaw, Geoff; Renfree, Marilyn B",BMC Genomics,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-13-155; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22537233/,476
678361,What is the future of advanced human capital formation in Chile ? Current and post-COVID-19 scenarios,2021,"COVID-19 pandemic is inducing acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure, and eventual death. Respiratory failure is the leading cause of mortality in the elderly population with pre-existing medical conditions. This group is particularly vulnerable to infections due to a declined immune system, comorbidities, geriatric syndrome, and potentially inappropriate polypharmacy. These conditions make the elderly population more susceptible to the harmful effects of medications and the deleterious consequences of infections, including MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. Chronic diseases among elderlies, including respiratory diseases, hypertension, diabetes, and coronary heart diseases, present a significant challenge for healthcare professionals. To comply with the clinical guidelines, the practitioner may prescribe a complex medication regimen that adds up to the burden of pre-existing treatment, potentially inducing adverse drug reactions and leading to harmful side-effects. Consequently, the geriatric population is at increased risk of falls, frailty, and dependence that enhances their susceptibility to morbidity and mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 respiratory syndrome, particularly interstitial pneumonia. The major challenge resides in the detection of infection that may present as atypical manifestations in this age group. Healthy aging can be possible with adequate preventive measures and appropriate medication regimen and follow-up. Adherence to the guidelines and recommendations of WHO, CDC, and other national/regional/international agencies can reduce the risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Better training programs are needed to enhance the skill of health care professionals and patient’s caregivers.

The global propagation of the viral disease, denoted COVID-19 (“coronavirus disease 2019”), has unified the scientific community in searching for possible inhibitory small molecules or polypeptides. A holistic understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 vs. human inter-species interactome promises to identify putative protein-protein interactions (PPI) that may be considered targets for the development of inhibitory therapeutics. METHODS: We leverage two state-of-the-art, sequence-based PPI predictors (PIPE4 & SPRINT) capable of generating the comprehensive SARS-CoV-2 vs. human interactome, comprising approximately 285,000 pairwise predictions. Three prediction schemas (all, proximal, RP-PPI) are leveraged to obtain our highest-confidence subset of PPIs and human proteins predicted to interact with each of the 14 SARS-CoV-2 proteins considered in this study. Notably, the use of the Reciprocal Perspective (RP) framework demonstrates improved predictive performance in multiple cross-validation experiments. RESULTS: The all schema identified 279 high-confidence putative interactions involving 225 human proteins, the proximal schema identified 129 high-confidence putative interactions involving 126 human proteins, and the RP-PPI schema identified 539 high-confidence putative interactions involving 494 human proteins. The intersection of the three sets of predictions comprise the seven highest-confidence PPIs. Notably, the Spike-ACE2 interaction was the highest ranked for both the PIPE4 and SPRINT predictors with the all and proximal schemas, corroborating existing evidence for this PPI. Several other predicted PPIs are biologically relevant within the context of the original SARS-CoV virus. Furthermore, the PIPE-Sites algorithm was used to identify the putative subsequence that might mediate each interaction and thereby inform the design of inhibitory polypeptides intended to disrupt the corresponding host-pathogen interactions. CONCLUSION: We publicly released the comprehensive sets of PPI predictions and their corresponding PIPE-Sites landscapes in the following DataVerse repository: https://www.doi.org/10.5683/SP2/JZ77XA.

This study aimed to determine the factors related to the occupational balance in the Spanish population during home confinement as a consequence of the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic. A total of 3261 subjects completed an online survey, which was disseminated through the mainstream social media platforms in Spain and included the Occupational Balance Questionnaire (OBQ), sociodemographic variables, and factors related to COVID-19 infection. The mean age of the participants (81.69% women) was 40.53 years (SD ± 14.05). Sociodemographic variables were related to a greater occupational balance, and the multivariate analysis showed that age (β = 0.071; p = 0.001), the perception of having received enough information (β = 0.071; p ≤ 0.001), not telecommuting (β = −0.047; p = 0.022), and not being infected by COVID-19 (β = 0.055; p = 0.007) contributed to a better occupational balance. There were profiles of people less likely to suffer disturbances in occupational balance during home confinement, but more studies are needed to help understand and analyze the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on people’s occupational and mental health.","González-Bernal, Jerónimo J.; Santamaría-Peláez, Mirian; González-Santos, Josefa; Rodríguez-Fernández, Paula; León del Barco, Benito; Soto-Cámara, Raúl",J Clin Med,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9113606; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33182379/,476

Many drug molecules can bind to plasma proteins to different extents in vivo, whereas only the free drug can reach the site of action to exert a pharmacological effect and cause toxicity. However, free MTX concentrations in plasma have not been reported. Traditional analyses of free drugs are both cumbersome and inaccurate. We collected 92 plasma samples from 52 children diagnosed with ALL or NHL or other lymphomas that were treated with HD-MTX. The hollow fiber centrifugal ultrafiltration (HFCF-UF) was used to prepare plasma samples for analysis of the free MTX concentration. Protein precipitation was employed to measure the total MTX concentration. The HFCF-UF is a simple method involving a step of ordinary centrifugation; the validation parameters for the methodological results were satisfactory and fell within the acceptance criteria. A linearity coefficient r (2) of 0.910 was obtained for the correlation between the free and total MTX plasma concentrations in 92 plasma samples. However, the free and total MTX concentrations was only weakly correlated in 16 clinical plasma specimens with total MTX concentrations >2 μmol L(−1) (r (2) = 0.760). Both the free and total MTX concentrations at 42 h were negatively correlated with the creatinine clearance (CCr) level (P = 0.023, r = −0.236 for total MTX and P = 0.020, r = −0.241for free MTX, respectively). The free MTX concentration could not be accurately estimated from the total MTX concentration for patients with high MTX levels which are conditions under which toxic reactions are more likely to occur. High plasma MTX levels could become a predictor of the occurrence of MTX nephrotoxicity to draw people's attention. The proposed HFCF-UF method is a simple and accurate way to evaluate efficacy and toxicity in clinical therapeutic drug monitoring.","Dong, Wei-Chong; Guo, Jia-Liang; Wu, Xi-Kun; Zhao, Meng-Qiang; Li, Hao-Ran; Zhang, Zhi-Qing; Jiang, Ye",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33995039/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2021.636975,476
678896,Does coronavirus pose a challenge to the diagnoses of anxiety and depression? A view from psychiatry,2020-09-03,"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic has had a profound, lasting impact on the world’s population. A key aspect to providing care for those with COVID-19 and checking its further spread is early and accurate diagnosis of infection, which has been generally done via methods for amplifying and detecting viral RNA molecules. Detection and quantitation of peptides using targeted mass spectrometry-based strategies has been proposed as an alternative diagnostic tool due to direct detection of molecular indicators from non-invasively collected samples as well as the potential for high-throughput analysis in a clinical setting; many studies have revealed the presence of viral peptides within easily accessed patient samples. However, evidence suggests that some viral peptides could serve as better indicators of COVID-19 infection status than others, due to potential misidentification of peptides derived from human host proteins, poor spectral quality, high limits of detection etc. In this study we have compiled a list of 639 peptides identified from Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) samples, including from in vitro and clinical sources. These datasets were rigorously analyzed using automated, Galaxy-based workflows containing tools such as PepQuery, BLAST-P, and the Multi-omic Visualization Platform as well as the open-source tools MetaTryp and Proteomics Data Viewer (PDV). Using PepQuery for confirming peptide spectrum matches, we were able to narrow down the 639 peptide possibilities to 87 peptides which were most robustly detected and specific to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The specificity of these sequences to coronavirus taxa was confirmed using Unipept and BLAST-P. Applying stringent statistical scoring thresholds, combined with manual verification of peptide spectrum match quality, 4 peptides derived from the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein and membrane protein were found to be most robustly detected across all cell culture and clinical samples, including those collected non-invasively. We propose that these peptides would be of the most value for clinical proteomics applications seeking to detect COVID-19 from a variety of sample types. We also contend that samples taken from the upper respiratory tract and oral cavity have the highest potential for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection from easily collected patient samples using mass spectrometry-based proteomics assays.","Rajczewski, Andrew T.; Mehta, Subina; Nguyen, Dinh Duy An; Grüning, Björn A.; Johnson, James E.; McGowan, Thomas; Griffin, Timothy J.; Jagtap, Pratik D.",medRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33688669/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.09.21251427,476
679223,Geospatial analysis of misinformation in COVID-19 related tweets,2021-06-04,"The role of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), its lipid metabolite prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and Eicosanoid (EP) receptors (EP; 1-4) underlying the proinflammatory mechanistic aspects of Burkitt’s lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, cervical cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, and Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) is an active area of investigation. The tumorigenic potential of COX-2 and PGE2 through EP receptors forms the mechanistic context underlying the chemotherapeutic potential of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Although role of the COX-2 is described in several viral associated malignancies, the biological significance of the COX-2/PGE2/EP receptor inflammatory axis is extensively studied only in Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV/HHV-8) associated malignancies such as KS, a multifocal endothelial cell tumor and primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), a B cell-proliferative disorder. The purpose of this review is to summarize the salient findings delineating the molecular mechanisms downstream of COX-2 involving PGE2 secretion and its autocrine and paracrine interactions with EP receptors (EP1-4), COX-2/PGE2/EP receptor signaling regulating KSHV pathogenesis and latency. KSHV infection induces COX-2, PGE2 secretion, and EP receptor activation. The resulting signal cascades modulate the expression of KSHV latency genes (latency associated nuclear antigen-1 [LANA-1] and viral-Fas (TNFRSF6)-associated via death domain like interferon converting enzyme-like- inhibitory protein [vFLIP]). vFLIP was also shown to be crucial for the maintenance of COX-2 activation. The mutually interdependent interactions between viral proteins (LANA-1/vFLIP) and COX-2/PGE2/EP receptors was shown to play key roles in the biological mechanisms involved in KS and PEL pathogenesis such as blockage of apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, transformation, proliferation, angiogenesis, adhesion, invasion, and immune-suppression. Understanding the COX-2/PGE2/EP axis is very important to develop new safer and specific therapeutic modalities for KS and PEL. In addition to COX-2 being a therapeutic target, EP receptors represent ideal targets for pharmacologic agents as PGE2 analogues and their blockers/antagonists possess antineoplastic activity, without the reported gastrointestinal and cardiovascular toxicity observed with few a NSAIDs.","Paul, Arun George; Chandran, Bala; Sharma-Walia, Neelam",Transl Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23567332/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trsl.2013.03.004; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1931524413000777; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931524413000777,476

A genome wide association study (GWAS) on this population suggested that resistance was polygenic but failed to identify any strong specific associations. In order to enhance the power of GWAS or whole genome sequencing to identify strong genetic associations, a decision was made to positively select for resistance over three generations. The inbreeding experiment began with a genetically related parental (P) population consisting of three toms and four queens identified from among the survivors of the earlier study and belonging to a closely related subgroup (B). The subsequent effects of inbreeding were measured using 42 genome-wide STR markers. P generation cats produced 57 first filial (F1) kittens, only five of which (9.0%) demonstrated a natural resistance to FIPV infection. One of these five F1 survivors was then used to produce six F1/P-backcrosses kittens, only one of which proved resistant to FIP. Six of eight of the F1 and F1/P survivors succumbed to a secondary exposure 4–12 months later. Therefore, survival after both primary and secondary infection was decreased rather than increased by positive selection for resistance. The common genetic factor associated with this diminished resistance was a loss of heterozygosity.","Pedersen, Niels C.; Liu, Hongwei; Durden, Monica; Lyons, Leslie A.",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242716300022; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26964713/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242716300022; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2016.01.002,476

Targeted approaches to change prescription behavior are scarce. This study aimed at identifying specific barriers and facilitators for prudent antibiotic use in German dentistry by using qualitative methods. Nine in-depth interviews and two focus group discussions with another nine dentists were conducted and analyzed thematically. Dentists described being conflicted by the discordance of available treatment time and the necessity of thorough therapy. Lacking the opportunity of follow-up led to uncertainty. Dentists felt a lack of medical competency concerning prophylaxis for infectious endocarditis. A lack of empowerment to make therapeutic decisions interfered with guideline-conformity. The communication with fellow physicians is conflictual and improvement was wished for. In consequence, dentists felt pressure by potential medico-legal liability. Patients demanding quick and easy pain relief put extra strain on the interviewed dentists. Our hypotheses concord with preliminary data, mainly from the UK, but highlighted specifically medico-legal concerns and interprofessional communication as even greater barriers as described before. Tailored interventional concepts based on our findings may have the potential to lower antibiotic prescriptions in German primary dental care.","Böhmer, Femke; Hornung, Anne; Burmeister, Ulrike; Köchling, Anna; Altiner, Attila; Lang, Hermann; Löffler, Christin",Antibiotics (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/antibiotics10080987; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34439037/,476
684076,COVID-19 in the Greater Mekong Subregion: how resilient are rural households?,2020-07-13,"Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) is highly polymorphic and plays a key role in guiding adaptive immune responses by presenting foreign and self peptides to T cells. Each HLA variant selects a minor fraction of peptides that match a certain motif required for optimal interaction with the peptide-binding groove. These restriction rules define the landscape of peptides presented to T cells. Given these limitations, one might suggest that the choice of peptides presented by HLA is non-random and there is preferential presentation of an array of peptides that is optimal for distinguishing self and foreign proteins. In this study we explore these preferences with a comparative analysis of self peptides enriched and depleted in HLA ligands. We show that HLAs exhibit preferences towards presenting peptides from certain proteins while disfavoring others with specific functions, and highlight differences between various HLA genes and alleles in those preferences. We link those differences to HLA anchor residue propensities and amino acid composition of preferentially presented proteins. The set of proteins that peptides presented by a given HLA are most likely to be derived from can be used to distinguish between class I and class II HLAs and HLA alleles. Our observations can be extrapolated to explain the protective effect of certain HLA alleles in infectious diseases, and we hypothesize that they can also explain susceptibility to certain autoimmune diseases and cancers. We demonstrate that these differences lead to differential presentation of HIV, influenza virus, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 proteins by various HLA alleles. Finally, we show that the reported self peptidome preferences of distinct HLA variants can be compensated by combinations of HLA-A/HLA-B and HLA-A/HLA-C alleles in frequent haplotypes.","Karnaukhov, Vadim; Paes, Wayne; Woodhouse, Isaac B.; Partridge, Thomas; Nicastri, Annalisa; Brackenridge, Simon; Scherbinin, Dmitrii; Chudakov, Dmitry M.; Zvyagin, Ivan V.; Ternette, Nicola; Koohy, Hashem; Borrow, Persephone; Shugay, Mikhail",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33619495/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.16.431395,476

CTE cannot yet be diagnosed during life. In December 2015, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke awarded a seven-year grant (U01NS093334) to fund the “Diagnostics, Imaging, and Genetics Network for the Objective Study and Evaluation of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (DIAGNOSE CTE) Research Project.” The objectives of this multicenter project are to: develop in vivo fluid and neuroimaging biomarkers for CTE; characterize its clinical presentation; refine and validate clinical research diagnostic criteria (i.e., traumatic encephalopathy syndrome [TES]); examine repetitive head impact exposure, genetic, and other risk factors; and provide shared resources of anonymized data and biological samples to the research community. In this paper, we provide a detailed overview of the rationale, design, and methods for the DIAGNOSE CTE Research Project. METHODS: The targeted sample and sample size was 240 male participants, ages 45–74, including 120 former professional football players, 60 former collegiate football players, and 60 asymptomatic participants without a history of head trauma or participation in organized contact sports. Participants were evaluated at one of four U.S. sites and underwent the following baseline procedures: neurological and neuropsychological examinations; tau and amyloid positron emission tomography; magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy; lumbar puncture; blood and saliva collection; and standardized self-report measures of neuropsychiatric, cognitive, and daily functioning. Study partners completed similar informant-report measures. Follow-up evaluations were intended to be in-person and at 3 years post-baseline. Multidisciplinary diagnostic consensus conferences are held, and the reliability and validity of TES diagnostic criteria are examined. RESULTS: Participant enrollment and all baseline evaluations were completed in February 2020. Three-year follow-up evaluations began in October 2019. However, in-person evaluation ceased with the COVID-19 pandemic, and resumed as remote, 4-year follow-up evaluations (including telephone-, online-, and videoconference-based cognitive, neuropsychiatric, and neurologic examinations, as well as in-home blood draw) in February 2021. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from the DIAGNOSE CTE Research Project should facilitate detection and diagnosis of CTE during life, and thereby accelerate research on risk factors, mechanisms, epidemiology, treatment, and prevention of CTE.

Since its emergence, the virus has spread rapidly and has been declared a global pandemic. As of the end of January 2021, there are almost 100 million cases worldwide with over 2 million confirmed deaths. Widespread testing is essential to reduce further spread of the disease, but due to a shortage of testing kits and limited supply, alternative testing methods are being evaluated.

An intelligent system can help the radiologists to detect COVID-19 from these CXR images which can come in handy at remote locations in many developing nations. In this work, we propose a pipeline that uses CXR images to detect COVID-19 infection. The features from the CXR images were extracted and the relevant features were then selected using Hybrid Social Group Optimization algorithm. The selected features were then used to classify the CXR images using a number of classifiers.

In Turkey, which has a strong health system, most hospitals have been turned into pandemic hospitals, elective procedures have been postponed, and doctors have been reassigned to treat COVID-19. Efforts to limit spread of COVID-19 have been effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19. Behind this success was not only the intrinsic strength of the health system but also the strict changes in everyday life wrought by the crisis. It is an inescapable fact that these new measures, such as the imposition of curfew and lockdown, have had a significant effect on the mental health of the general population. Anxiety caused by COVID-19 has spread to the mental state of everyone. Although coronavirus-related diseases will end soon, it is predicted that serious psychiatric disorders will be a lasting consequence of the pandemic. Despite the many negatives brought by COVID-19, it has led to a positive unity between the public and healthcare professionals, and in spite of significant risks to their own health, healthcare workers have risen to the challenge of COVID-19.","Öğütlü, Hakan",Irish journal of psychological medicine,https://doi.org/10.1017/ipm.2020.57; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32434621/,476

We explored the safe and effective management of tracheostomy in COVID‐19 patients, to benefit patients and protect health care workers at the same time. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 11 hospitalized COVID‐19 patients undergoing tracheostomy. Clinical features of patients, ventilator withdrawal after tracheostomy, surgical complications, and nosocomial infection of the health care workers associated with the tracheostomy were analyzed. RESULTS: The tracheostomy of all the 11 cases (100%) was performed successfully, including percutaneous tracheostomy of 6 cases (54.5%) and conventional open tracheostomy of 5 cases (45.5%). No severe postoperative complications occurred, and no health care workers associated with the tracheostomy are confirmed to be infected by SARS‐CoV‐2. CONCLUSION: Comprehensive evaluation before tracheostomy, optimized procedures during tracheostomy, and special care after tracheostomy can make the tracheostomy safe and beneficial in COVID‐19 patients.","Zhang, Xiaomeng; Huang, Qiling; Niu, Xun; Zhou, Tao; Xie, Zhen; Zhong, Yi; Xiao, Hongjun",Head Neck,https://doi.org/10.1002/hed.26261; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32427403/,476

Methods The efficacy of anticoagulation therapy in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was evaluated using a nationwide registry, the COVID-19 Registry Japan. Inverse probability of weight treatment method was used to adjust for baseline confounders in the anticoagulation and non-anticoagulation groups. Results Of the 1748 patients included, anticoagulants were used in 367 patients (treatment group). The patients in the anticoagulant group were older and predominantly male and often presented with obesity, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, and elevated D-dimer levels. The 29-day mortality was 7.6% in the whole cohort (treatment group, 11.2%; no treatment group, 6.6%), 6% in patients who were not treated with steroids (treatment group, 12.3%; no treatment group, 5.2%), and 11.2% in patients treated with steroids (treatment group, 10.5%; no treatment group, 11.8%). Mortality in the whole cohort was similar between the treatment and no treatment groups (p=0.99), and an insignificant decreasing trend in mortality was observed in those treated with steroids (p=0.075).

688517,Transmission potential of COVID-19 in South Korea,2020-02-29,"BackgroundAntibody testing can help define how protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is and how long this immunity lasts. Many antibody tests have been evaluated in hospitalised rather than community based COVID-19 cases. Virtus Respiratory Research Ltd (Virtus) has developed its own quantitative IgM and IgG SARS CoV-2 antibody assay. We report its validation and performance characteristics and compare its performance with the Abbott Architect and Roche Elecsys assays in community COVID cases. MethodsWe developed a quantitative antibody test to detect IgM and IgG to the SARS-CoV-2 S1 spike protein (the Virtus test) and validated this test in 107 ""true positive"" sera from 106 community-managed and 1 hospitalised COVID-19 cases and 208 ""true negative"" serum samples. We validated the Virtus test against a neutralising antibody test. We determined sensitivities of the Abbott test in the 107 true positive samples and the Roche test in a subset of 75 true positive samples. ResultsThe Virtus quantitative test was positive in 93 of 107 (87%) community cases of COVID-19 and both IgM and IgG levels correlated strongly with neutralising antibody titres (r=0.75 for IgM, r=0.71 for IgG, P<0.0001 for both antibodies). The specificity of the Virtus test was 98.6% for low level antibody positives, 99.5% for moderate positives and 100% for high or very high positives. The Abbott test had a sensitivity of 68%. In the 75 sample subset, the Virtus test was positive in 91%, the Roche test in 69%. ConclusionsThe Abbott and Roche tests had sensitives of 68% and 69% respectively in this community set of COVID-19 sera, while the Virtus test had sensitivities of 87% and 91% in the same sample sets. The strong positive correlation with virus neutralization suggests a positive Virtus quantitative antibody test is likely predictive of protective against recurrent COVID-19. FundingThe development of the Virtus test and sample testing with all antibody tests was funded by Virtus Respiratory Research Ltd.

688661,Mitral Annular Plane Systolic Excursion: An Early Marker of Mortality in Severe COVID-19 Infection,2020-08-18,"INTRODUCTION: Exercise training is strongly recommended as a therapeutic approach to treat individuals with heart failure. High-intensity exercise training modalities still controversial in this population. The study aims to preliminary assess the consequences of high-intensity exercise training modalities, aerobic interval training (HIIT) and progressive high circuit-resistance training (CRT), on primarily endothelial function and cardiorespiratory fitness, and secondly on muscle strength and physical performance in heart failure patients. METHODS: This preliminary multicentric randomized controlled trial comprised 23 heart failure patients, aged 56 ± 10 years old, mainly New York Heart Association classification I and II (%), hemodynamically stable, who compromise at least 36 exercise sessions of a randomly assigned intervention (HIIT, CRT or control group). Endothelial function, cardiopulmonary exercise testing, muscle strength and physical performance were completed at baseline and post-intervention. RESULTS: Although no effects on endothelial function; both HIIT and CRT modalities were able to produce a positive effect on [Image: see text] peak (HIIT = +2.1±6.5, CRT = +3.0±4.2 and control group = -0.1± 5.3 mL/kg/min, time*group p-value<0,05) and METs (HIIT = +0.6±1.8, CRT = +0.9±1.2 and control group = 0±1.6, time*group p-value<0,05). Only HIIT increased isokinetic torque peak (HIIT = +8.8±55.8, CRT = 0.0±60.7 and control group = 1.6±57.6 Nm) matched p-value<0,05. Regarding the physical performance, the CRT modality reduced chair stand test completion time (HIIT = -0.7±3.1, CRT = -3.3±3.2 and control group = -0.3±2.5 s, matched p-value<0,05 and HIIT improved global physical performance(time*group p<0,05). CONCLUSION: This preliminary study trends to indicate for the first time that high-intensity interval training promotes a jointly superior effect compared to progressive high intensity circuit-resistance training by improving cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular strength, and physical performance. Further research with larger cohort is necessary.

Immunodeficiency, precariousness and promiscuity could increase the risk of COVID-19 in HIV-infected patients and in preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) users. No epidemiological data are available in these two populations. We report COVID-19 attack rate in HIV-infected patients and in PrEP users in the Rhône department, France, and compared it with the general population. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of a laboratory database. METHODS: COVID-19 testing strategy in France was centered on symptomatic infections, hospitalized patients and symptomatic healthcare workers while most asymptomatic cases were not confirmed. SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate on PCR assays and COVID-19 attack rate were determined in HIV-infected patients and in PrEP users. COVID-19 attack rate in the general population was estimated from health authorities’ database and demographic data. A corrected attack rate taking into account the laboratory representativeness was calculated. RESULTS: From March to April 2020, 24 860 samples from 19 113 patients (HIV-infected 77, PrEP users 27, others 19 009) were assessed for SARS-CoV-2 PCR assay. The positivity rate appeared similar in HIV-infected patients (15.6%), in PrEP users (14.8%) and in other patients (19.1%). The crude/corrected COVID-19 attack rate appeared similar in HIV-infected patients (0.31/0.38%) and in PrEP users (0.38/0.42%), and of the same order as the estimated attack rate in the general population (0.24%).

Tobacco use is a risk factor common to most NCDs. This article discusses tobacco control policies and highlights major achievements and open challenges to reduce smoking prevalence and attributable morbidity and mortality in the 21st century. The introduction of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in 2005 has been a key achievement in the field and has already facilitated a drop in both smoking prevalence and exposure to secondhand smoke. Indicatively, the size of the worldwide population benefiting from at least one cost‐effective tobacco control policy has quadrupled since 2007. In addition, plain cigarette packaging has been successfully introduced as a tobacco control policy, surmounting efforts of the tobacco industry to challenge this based on trade and investment law. Nevertheless, tobacco control still faces major challenges. Smoking prevalence needs to be further reduced in a rather expedited manner. Smoke‐free environments should be extended, and the use of plain tobacco packaging with large pictorial health warnings for all tobacco products should be further promoted in some parts of the world. Some of these measures will require prompt determination and diligence. For example, bold political decisions are needed to significantly increase real prices of tobacco products through excise taxes, ban added ingredients that are currently used to increase the attractiveness of tobacco products and ban the tobacco industry's corporate social responsibility initiatives. Finally, the debate on harm reduction strategies for tobacco control still needs to be resolved.","Peruga, Armando; López, María José; Martinez, Cristina; Fernández, Esteve",Mol Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33533185/; https://doi.org/10.1002/1878-0261.12918,476

Necropolitics: The Chaotic Judicialization of COVID-19 in Brazil,2021-06-11,"Single‐domain antibodies (sdAbs) offer the affinity and therapeutic value of conventional antibodies, with increased stability and solubility. Unlike conventional antibodies, however, sdAbs do not benefit from a platform manufacturing process. While successful production of a variety of sdAbs has been shown in numerous hosts, purification methods are often molecule specific or require affinity tags, which generally cannot be used in clinical manufacturing due to regulatory concerns. Here, we have developed a broadly applicable production and purification process for sdAbs in Komagataella phaffii (Pichia pastoris) and demonstrated the production of eight different sdAbs at a quality appropriate for nonclinical studies. We developed a two‐step, integrated purification process without the use of affinity resins and showed that modification of a single process parameter, pH of the bridging buffer, was required for the successful purification of a variety of sdAbs. Further, we determined that this parameter can be predicted based only on the biophysical characteristics of the target molecule. Using these methods, we produced nonclinical quality sdAbs as few as 5 weeks after identifying the product sequence. Nonclinical studies of three different sdAbs showed that molecules produced using our platform process conferred protection against viral shedding of rotavirus or H1N1 influenza and were equivalent to similar molecules produced in Escherichia coli and purified using affinity tags.","Crowell, Laura E.; Goodwine, Chaz; Holt, Carla S.; Rocha, Lucia; Vega, Celina; Rodriguez, Sergio A.; Dalvie, Neil C.; Tracey, Mary K.; Puntel, Mariana; Wigdorovitz, Andrés; Parreño, Viviana; Love, Kerry R.; Cramer, Steven M.; Love, J.

While the recent focus has been on newly emerged agents, several well‐established pathogens provide timely reminders that other agents continue to pose threats, but invariably ‘fly under the radar’, thereby failing to elicit adequate measures to prevent their transmission by blood transfusion. Perhaps foremost among this group of agents are the Babesia spp., which have been known to cause human disease, in the USA, for close to 40 years. B. microti, B. divergens and several Babesia‐like agents are responsible for a growing number of human babesiosis infections. Concomitantly, in the USA, there has been a sharp rise in the number of transfusion‐transmitted infections of Babesia spp., attributable almost exclusively to B. microti. Despite the obvious public health issues posed by Babesia spp., options for preventing their transmission by blood transfusion remain limited. However, recognition that the Babesia spp. are indeed an ongoing and expanding blood safety threat will probably prove instrumental in the development of viable interventions to limit transmission of these agents.","Leiby, D.
