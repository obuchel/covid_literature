65379,65379,65379,Smoking and comorbidities are associated with COVID-19 severity and mortality in 565 patients treated in Turkey: a retrospective observational study.,20.70435,-1.0274249,2020-12-01,"Emerging diseases are frequently caused by novel or previously unrecognised zoonotic viral pathogens, which tend to originate in and emerge from wildlife. When human or animal cases are first recognised, molecular or serological diagnostic assays specific to them do not yet exist, causing a delay in the identification of an outbreak's aetiologic agent as well as its source. Preparing for the next virus to emerge is a major public health challenge, impeded by a poor understanding of the diversity of potential candidates that exist in wildlife reservoirs. Characterising the diversity of viruses in key wildlife species will help to reduce the time between detection and response in an outbreak situation, and inform public health strategies that reduce the risk of spillover from animal reservoirs. Pathogen discovery techniques such as consensus polymerase chain reaction (cPCR) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) have been used to identify known and novel viruses in animals and humans, but have not been widely used in surveillance programmes. Metagenomic studies have identified novel viruses, new strains of known viruses, and have characterised host microbiomes. While NGS represents an unbiased approach to viral sequence detection, it is constrained by lower sensitivity than conventional PCR, requires substantial bioinformatics capabilities, and is cost prohibitive and therefore not widely available in the regions of the world that are most vulnerable to zoonotic disease emergence. In contrast, consensus PCR uses standard and widely available technologies, has greater sensitivity than NGS, and has also been used to identify novel viruses in wildlife, livestock and humans, though it is limited to detecting target genetic sequences conserved across known groups of viruses. The use of cPCR, in combination, if possible, with NGS and serology, can offer a powerful approach to rapidly identifying aetiologic agents in an outbreak and characterising the virome of key wildlife known to carry zoonotic viruses. Here, the authors review pathogen discovery techniques currently being used in human and animal surveillance programmes and the challenges of using viral discovery to identify novel zoonotic pathogens.","Epstein, J H; Anthony, S J",Revue scientifique et technique,871,1

Two pairs of specific primers were designed targeting the N gene sequence of PEDV and VP1 gene sequence of PBoV3/4/5. PEDV and PBoV3/4/5 could be distinguished by their different melting temperatures (Tm) in one sample. The Tm value of PEDV was 83.5 °C, and the Tm value of PBoV3/4/5 was 78.5 °C, while other swine pathogens showed no specific melting peaks. The detection limits of this assay were 10 copies/μL for both PEDV and PBoV3/4/5. A total of sixty-three intestinal tissue samples were collected from piglets suffering from diarrhea, and the viral nucleic acids detected and identified by the real-time PCR assay and conventional PCR assay. The duplex real-time PCR detection results showed that the prevalence of PEDV and PBoV3/4/5 was 85.7% and 46%, respectively, and the co-infection rate of the two viruses was 28.6%. These results indicated that this duplex real-time PCR assay was a sensitive, specific and reproducible method for differentiating PEDV and PBoV3/4/5 or their co-infection.","Zheng, Lan-Lan; Cui, Jian-Tao; Han, Hao-Ying; Hou, Hua-Lin; Wang, Le-Yi; Liu, Fang; Chen, Hong-Ying",Molecular and cellular probes,871,1

We report on our RY reconstruction technique and special approaches, and evaluate the usefulness of our reconstruction method based on the surgical results of 100 patients we have experienced to date. METHODS We performed LTG in 100 patients with gastric cancer. After total gastrectomy using five ports, the resected stomach was extracted through a small laparotomy. Through that, we performed sacrifice of the jejunum, Y limb anastomosis, creation of the lifted jejunum. As the OL, a side-to-side anastomosis of the lifted jejunum to the esophageal stump was laparoscopically performed using a linear stapler in an isoperistaltic direction, and the entry hole was closed with full-thickness suturing. The lifted jejunum was fixed with suture to the duodenal stump at a location where the esophagojejunostomy site was made linear, and the duodenal stump was buried. The mesenteric gap was laparoscopically closed with suture. RESULTS The median operative time in 100 patients undergoing LTG was 385 min, the median blood loss was 65 mL, and the median time required for the OL was 32 min. The mean hospitalization period was 10 days, and postoperative complications included bleeding requiring reoperation in one patient; other complications such as pancreatic fistula in five patients (5 %) were treated conservatively. No complication associated with anastomosis occurred. CONCLUSION In RY reconstruction using the OL, there were no complications associated with the anastomosis site in 100 consecutive patients, such as anastomotic leak or stenosis, indicating that it is a very useful and safe reconstruction method.","Kitagami, Hidehiko; Morimoto, Mamoru; Nakamura, Kenichi; Watanabe, Takahiro; Kurashima, Yo; Nonoyama, Keisuke; Watanabe, Kaori; Fujihata, Shiro; Yasuda, Akira; Yamamoto, Minoru; Shimizu, Yasunobu; Tanaka, Moritsugu",Surgical endoscopy,871,1

The existing literature on COVID-19 vaccination-related cutaneous adverse reactions largely focused on messenger RNA vaccines and mainly included type 1 hypersensitivity reactions, such as urticaria and angioedema. Other cutaneous manifestations are still poorly characterized and have been classified as delayed hypersensitivity rash. Our prospective observational study on a sample of 2740 subjects who underwent the COVID-19 vaccination aimed at defining the prevalence of cutaneous adverse reactions and at identifying their timing of onset and their correlation with the administered dose. Vaccine-related cutaneous adverse reactions occurred in 50 subjects. Patients were asked to complete a questionnaire on the type of COVID-19 vaccine received, the time of onset of cutaneous reactions, the dates of administration. Out of 2740 individuals who received the COVID-19 vaccination, 50 were diagnosed with cutaneous adverse reactions to vaccine, after the first dose in 28 patients, after the second in 20 and after both in 2. We reported localized injection site erythema in 12 patients and generalized cutaneous reactions in 38 patients. Our study shows that cutaneous adverse reactions to COVID-19 vaccination are not common and most often occur after the first dose, recurring infrequently after the second dose. These reactions are usually easily manageable and, even in severe generalized cases, oral antihistamines and corticosteroids were sufficient for resolution. Therefore, except for immediate hypersensitivity reactions, cutaneous adverse reactions do not represent a contraindication to the completion of the vaccination cycle.","Grieco, Teresa; Maddalena, Patrizia; Sernicola, Alvise; Muharremi, Rovena; Basili, Stefania; Alvaro, Domenico; Cangemi, Roberto; Rossi, Alfredo; Pellacani, Giovanni",Dermatologic therapy,871,1

The estimation of the unemployment rate has drawn researchers' attention in recent years. This investigation's key objective is to inquire about the impact of COVID-19 on the unemployment rate in selected, developed and developing countries of Asia. For experts and policymakers, effective prediction of the unemployment rate is an influential test that assumes an important role in planning the monetary and financial development of a country. Numerous researchers have recently utilized conventional analysis tools for unemployment rate prediction. Notably, unemployment data sets are nonstationary. Therefore, modeling these time series by conventional methods can produce an arbitrary mistake. To overcome the accuracy problem associated with conventional approaches, this investigation assumes intelligent-based prediction approaches to deal with the unemployment data and to predict the unemployment rate for the upcoming years more precisely. These intelligent-based unemployment rate strategies will force their implications by repeating diversity in the unemployment rate. For illustration purposes, unemployment data sets of five advanced and five developing countries of Asia, essentially Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, and five agricultural countries (i.e., Pakistan, China, India, Bangladesh and Indonesia) are selected. The hybrid ARIMA-ARNN model performed well among all hybrid models for advanced countries of Asia, while the hybrid ARIMA-ANN outperformed for developing countries aside from China, and hybrid ARIMA-SVM performed well for China. Furthermore, for future unemployment rate prediction, these selected models are utilized. The result displays that in developing countries of Asia, the unemployment rate will be three times higher as compared to advanced countries in the coming years, and it will take double the time to address the impacts of Coronavirus in developing countries than in developed countries of Asia.","Lai, Han; Khan, Yousaf Ali; Thaljaoui, Adel; Chammam, Wathek; Abbas, Syed Zaheer",Soft comput,871,5

With weak fiscal base and inelasticity in budget spending, when these countries face a catastrophe like COVID-19, there is a whole situation of havoc and lack of finances emerges as the biggest issue in such crises. Pakistan has been no exception to this kind of situation. Government funds allocated to other public sector development schemes are diverted to deal with the health emergency. Hence, the result is an overall socioeconomic shock that a country has to face. Amid such crises, other international commitments also face a state of uncertainty.

This solution phase complexity impacts industries such as nuclear waste treatment, where NO2- significantly affects the solubility of other constituents present in sodium hydroxide (NaOH)-rich nuclear waste. This work provides molecular scale information into sodium nitrite (NaNO2) and NaOH ion-pairing processes to provide a physical basis for later development of thermodynamic models. Solubility isotherms of NaNO2 in aqueous mixtures with NaOH and total alkalinity were also measured. Spectroscopic characterization of these solutions utilized high-field nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and Raman spectroscopy, with additional solution structure detailed by X-ray total scattering pairwise distribution function analysis (X-ray PDF). Despite the NO2- deformation Raman band's insensitivity to added NaOH in saturated NaNO2 solutions, 23Na and 15N NMR studies indicated the Na+ and NO2- chemical environments change likely due to ion pairing. The ion pairing correlates with a decrease in diffusion coefficient of solution species as measured by pulsed field gradient 23Na and 1H NMR. Two-dimensional correlation analyses of the 2800-4000 cm-1 Raman region and X-ray PDF indicated that saturated NaNO2 and NaOH mixtures disrupt the hydrogen network of water into a new structure where the length of the OO correlations is contracted relative to the typical H2O structure. Beyond describing the solubility of NaNO2 in a multicomponent electrolyte mixture, these results also indicate that nitrite exhibits greater ion pairing in mixtures of concentrated NaNO2 and NaOH than in comparable solutions with only NaNO2.","Graham, Trent R; Dembowski, Mateusz; Wang, Hsiu-Wen; Mergelsberg, Sebastian T; Nienhuis, Emily T; Reynolds, Jacob G; Delegard, Calvin H; Wei, Yihui; Snyder, Michelle; Leavy, Ian I; Baum, Steven R; Fountain, Matthew S; Clark, Sue B; Rosso, Kevin M; Pearce, Carolyn I",,871,20

Both these events trigger ""cytokine storm"" leading to acute lung and cardiovascular injury. A selective therapy for COVID-19 has not yet been identified. Clinical trials with remdesivir gave discordant results. Thus, healthcare systems have focused on ""multi-targeted"" therapeutic strategies aiming at relieving systemic inflammation and thrombotic complications. No randomized clinical trial has demonstrated the efficacy of renin angiotensin system antagonists in reducing inflammation related to COVID-19. Dexamethasone and tocilizumab showed encouraging data, but their use needs to be further validated. The still-controversial efficacy of these treatments highlighted the importance of organ injury prevention in COVID-19. Neprilysin (NEP) might be an interesting target for this purpose. NEP expression is increased by cytokines on lung fibroblasts surface. NEP activity is elevated in acute respiratory distress syndrome and it is conceivable that it is also high in COVID-19. NEP is implicated in the degradation of natriuretic peptides, bradykinin, substance P, adrenomedullin, and apelin that account for prevention of organ injury. Thus, NEP/angiotensin receptor type 1 (AT1R) inhibitor sacubitril/valsartan (SAC/VAL) may increase levels of these molecules and block AT1Rs required for ACE2 endocytosis in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, SAC/VAL has a positive impact on acute heart failure that is very frequently observed in deceased COVID-19 patients. The current review aims to summarize actual therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 and to examine the data supporting the potential benefits of SAC/VAL in COVID-19 treatment.","Bellis, Alessandro; Mauro, Ciro; Barbato, Emanuele; Trimarco, Bruno; Morisco, Carmine",Int. j. mol. sci.

The first manufacturer-independent head-to-head comparison of two rapid high-throughput automated electrochemiluminescence double-antigen sandwich immunoassays targeting total anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies against two different viral proteins, Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (Elecsys-N) and Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S (Elecsys-S) (Roche Diagnostics), was performed in a routine setting during the exponential growth phase of the epidemic's second wave. METHODS: The diagnostic specificity of Elecsys-N and Elecsys-S was initially evaluated on a panel of 572 pre-COVID-19 samples, showing 100 % specificity of both assays. Elecsys-N/Elecsys-S head-to-head comparison used 3,416 consecutive blood samples from individuals that were tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 within commercial out-of-pocket serologic testing. RESULTS: Elecsys-N/Elecsys-S head-to-head comparison showed overall agreement of 98.68 % (3,371/3,416; 95 % CI, 98.23-99.03 %), positive agreement of 95.16 % (884/929; 95 % CI, 93.52-96.41 %), and a high kappa value of 0.996 (95 % CI, 0.956-0.976).

The models are denoted SIR-$\omega$ and SEIR-$\omega$, and we focus attention on the early stages of an outbreak, where we derive expression for the basic reproduction number $R_0$ and the expected degree of the infectious nodes $E(D_I)$ using two different approximation approaches. The first approach approximates the early spread of an epidemic by a branching process, whereas the second one uses pair approximation. The expressions are compared with the corresponding empirical means obtained from stochastic simulations of SIR-$\omega$ and SEIR-$\omega$ epidemics on Poisson and scale-free networks. Without rewiring of exposed nodes, the two approaches predict the same epidemic threshold and the same $E(D_I)$ for both types of epidemics, the latter being very close to the mean degree obtained from simulated epidemics over Poisson networks. Above the epidemic threshold, pairwise models overestimate the value of $R_0$ computed from simulations, which turns out to be very close to the one predicted by the branching process approximation. When exposed individuals also rewire with $\alpha>0$ (perhaps unaware of being infected), the two approaches give different epidemic thresholds, with the branching process approximation being more in agreement with simulations.","Britton, Tom; Juher, David; Saldana, Joan",,871,30
307266,307266,307266,Kawasaki and COVID-19 disease in children: a systematic review,20.87031,-0.9093998,2020,"Worldwide, there were 463 million adults (20-79 years) with diabetes in 2019. These figures are expected to increase to 700 million by 2045. Additionally, approximately 4.2 million deaths worldwide were attributable to diabetes, and global health care expenditures on individuals with diabetes were estimated to be 760 billion U.S. dollars. One of the most effective ways to control this debilitating disease is to prevent it before it happens, which, based on evidence from the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) randomized controlled trial and other studies in different countries, is feasible with a change in weight, dietary habits, and physical activity levels. While many studies have shown the benefits of plant-based diets in diabetes prevention, no DPP studies have been found that have incorporated a plant-based diet for their dietary component. The purpose of this pilot study was to explore the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of implementing a worksite plant-based diabetes prevention program to inform larger randomized trials to be conducted in the future. This was a mixed-methods pilot study using a one group pretest-posttest design. The study was delivered to Teachers College, Columbia University employees and staff and was designed to use a modified version of the CDC's national curriculum, one that emphasizes plant-based eating patterns. The sessions ran during lunch hour where a healthy lunch that supported the behavior change goal of the session was provided. The Health Action Process Approach (HAPA) framework was used for both curriculum design and program evaluation. The principles of facilitated group discussion in a safe environment were used to deliver the sessions. The program was conducted in the spring semester of 2020, once a week, for a series of 13 weeks plus two voluntary booster sessions held 1 and 2 months after the program was completed. Midway through the semester, the program went virtual using synchronous video-conferencing technology due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Data on consumption of healthy and unhealthy plant- and animal-based foods, physical activity, and psychosocial variables were measured pre and post program using validated questionnaires;blood glucose values were measured as HbA1c using A1CNow SELFCHECK;and weights were measured weekly using Tanita SC-331S scales when classes were in-person and home scales when classes went virtual. Evaluations of participants' acceptability and satisfaction were assessed at the end of the program both quantitatively and through interviews. Finally, fidelity to the plant-based curriculum and evaluation of educational plan completion and engagement were done weekly. Forty-one individuals expressed interest in the study, but only 18 met the eligibility criteria, of whom 14 were finally enrolled, constituting 78%. The participants were ethnically/racially diverse. Attrition was very low with only one dropout, and this did not change when the program went virtual. Program delivery was in fact feasible and all 13 lessons and booster sessions were completed. The plant-based DPP was received with a high degree of acceptability and satisfaction by the participants. Participants described the safe environment created and the facilitated dialogue approach in the sessions, along with peer support as instrumental for their behavior changes. There were some significant improvements in the physiological, behavioral, and psychosocial outcome measures explored in the study which included: weight, diet quality in terms of plant-based and animal-based foods, physical activity levels, blood glucose levels, and behavioral and psychosocial determinants of behavior change of the Health Action Process Approach (HAPA) theoretical framework.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: A designated hospital for patients with covid-19 in Zhejiang province, China. PARTICIPANTS: 96 consecutively admitted patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection: 22 with mild disease and 74 with severe disease. Data were collected from 19 January 2020 to 20 March 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Ribonucleic acid (RNA) viral load measured in respiratory, stool, serum, and urine samples. Cycle threshold values, a measure of nucleic acid concentration, were plotted onto the standard curve constructed on the basis of the standard product. Epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory characteristics and treatment and outcomes data were obtained through data collection forms from electronic medical records, and the relation between clinical data and disease severity was analysed. RESULTS: 3497 respiratory, stool, serum, and urine samples were collected from patients after admission and evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 RNA viral load. Infection was confirmed in all patients by testing sputum and saliva samples. RNA was detected in the stool of 55 (59%) patients and in the serum of 39 (41%) patients. The urine sample from one patient was positive for SARS-CoV-2. The median duration of virus in stool (22 days, interquartile range 17-31 days) was significantly longer than in respiratory (18 days, 13-29 days; P=0.02) and serum samples (16 days, 11-21 days; P<0.001). The median duration of virus in the respiratory samples of patients with severe disease (21 days, 14-30 days) was significantly longer than in patients with mild disease (14 days, 10-21 days; P=0.04). In the mild group, the viral loads peaked in respiratory samples in the second week from disease onset, whereas viral load continued to be high during the third week in the severe group. Virus duration was longer in patients older than 60 years and in male patients. CONCLUSION: The duration of SARS-CoV-2 is significantly longer in stool samples than in respiratory and serum samples, highlighting the need to strengthen the management of stool samples in the prevention and control of the epidemic, and the virus persists longer with higher load and peaks later in the respiratory tissue of patients with severe disease.","Zheng, Shufa; Fan, Jian; Yu, Fei; Feng, Baihuan; Lou, Bin; Zou, Qianda; Xie, Guoliang; Lin, Sha; Wang, Ruonan; Yang, Xianzhi; Chen, Weizhen; Wang, Qi; Zhang, Dan; Liu, Yanchao; Gong, Renjie; Ma, Zhaohui; Lu, Siming; Xiao, Yanyan; Gu, Yaxi; Zhang, Jinming; Yao, Hangping; Xu, Kaijin; Lu, Xiaoyang; Wei, Guoqing; Zhou, Jianying; Fang, Qiang; Cai, Hongliu; Qiu, Yunqing; Sheng, Jifang; Chen, Yu; Liang, Tingbo",BMJ,871,16

Although telemedicine's use had been steadily increasing, the COVID-19 pandemic prompted an unprecedented interest and urgency among patients, health care professionals, and policymakers to facilitate health care devoid of the need for in-person contact. The growth in personal access to telecommunications technology meant an unprecedented number of people in the United States and around the world had access to the equipment and technology that would make virtual care possible from the home. As the mass implementation of telemedicine unfolded, it became quickly apparent that scaling up the use of telemedicine presented considerable new challenges, some of which worsened disparities. This article describes those challenges by examining the history of telemedicine, its role in both supporting access and creating new barriers to access in trying to get everyone connected, frameworks for thinking about those barriers, and facilitators that may help overcome them, with a particular focus on older adults and patients with cancer in rural communities.","Lopez, Ana Maria; Lam, Kenneth; Thota, Ramya",Am Soc Clin Oncol Educ Book,871,14

We estimate the viral dynamics using viral copy number at first detection combined with considerations arising from aerosol transmission. We take into account the recent findings that infected vaccinated adults may have live viral loads at the same level as infected unvaccinated adults. Our estimates suggest that twice weekly testing, which was adequate for the original strains of SARS-CoV-2 will be insufficient on its own to contain the spread of the Delta variant of concern. We exclude consideration of contact tracing since the rapidity of the onset of viral titre in the case of the Delta variant suggests that unless contact tracing and quarantine are performed very rapidly (i.e., much less than a day), these mitigations will be of minimal impact in reducing transmission. These crude estimates do not take into account heterogeneity of susceptibility, social activity, and compliance, nor do they include the additional reduction in transmission that could be achieved by masking and social distancing. In the setting of a large public university, these considerations suggest that risk-targeted testing of vaccinated students, staff and faculty combined with surveillance testing of all unvaccinated individuals is the most efficient way to reduce transmission of COVID-19.","Elbanna, Ahmed; Goldenfeld, Nigel",,871,21

There is still no specific medicine for COVID-19, which leaves a critical gap for the identification of new drug candidates for the disease. Recent studies have reported that the small-molecule enoxacin exerts an antiviral activity by enhancing the RNAi pathway. The aim of this study is to analyze if enoxacin can exert anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects. We exploit multiple computational tools and databases to examine (i) whether the RNAi mechanism, as the target pathway of enoxacin, could act on the SARS-CoV-2 genome, and (ii) microRNAs induced by enoxacin might directly silence viral components as well as the host cell proteins mediating the viral entry and replication. We find that the RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2 might be a suitable substrate for DICER activity. We also highlight several enoxacin-enhanced microRNAs which could target SARS-CoV-2 components, pro-inflammatory cytokines, host cell components facilitating viral replication, and transcription factors enriched in lung stem cells, thereby promoting their differentiation and lung regeneration. Finally, our analyses identify several enoxacin-targeted regulatory modules that were critically associated with exacerbation of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Overall, our analysis suggests that enoxacin could be a promising candidate for COVID-19 treatment through enhancing the RNAi pathway.","Ahmadi, Amirhossein; Moradi, Sharif",Sci Rep,871,20

This study aimed to implement an actuarial approach to classifying MCI in the Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly (ACTIVE) study. Method: ACTIVE study participants (N = 2,755) were classified as cognitively normal (CN) or as having MCI using NP criteria. Estimated proportion of MCI participants and reversion rates were examined as well as baseline characteristics by MCI subtype. Mixed effect models examined associations of MCI subtype with 10-year trajectories of self-reported independence and difficulty performing instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). Results: The proportion of MCI participants was estimated to be 18.8%. Of those with MCI at baseline, 19.2% reverted to CN status for all subsequent visits. At baseline, the multidomain-amnestic MCI group generally had the greatest breadth and depth of cognitive impairment and reported the most IADL difficulty. Longitudinally, MCI participants showed faster IADL decline than CN participants (multidomain-amnestic MCI > single domain-amnestic MCI > nonamnestic MCI). Conclusion: NP criteria identified a proportion of MCI and reversion rate within ACTIVE that is consistent with prior studies involving community-dwelling samples. The pattern of everyday functioning change suggests that being classified as MCI, particularly amnestic MCI, is predictive of future loss of independence. Future work will apply these classifications in ACTIVE to better understand the relationships between MCI and health, social, and cognitive intervention-related factors.

We aim to report the challenges and good practices recorded in the management of psychiatric conditions and delirium coexisting with COVID-19 and during the COVID-19 era across continents. Material and Methods: Early Career Psychiatrists (ECPs) from across five continents were approached to provide their perspective on the management of psychiatric conditions in patients with COVID-19 and during the current pandemic. Results: We collected information about the experiences from ten countries. Commonalities were similar psychiatric presentations and poor preparedness across countries. Differences were varying innovations and adjustments made in the management of psychiatric conditions coexisting with COVID-19. Good practices which can be adopted by other countries are novel approaches such as telepsychiatry, proactive consultation-liaison units and enhanced community services targeted at circumventing challenges faced yet providing mental health services. Conclusions: This publication highlights the need for global preparedness in the mental health sector during outbreaks of infectious diseases. With our results we can conclude that there is the need for concerted efforts targeted at global and locally sensitive adaptation of existing protocols and the development of new guidelines for the management of psychiatric conditions for the present pandemic and subsequent occurrences.","Ojeahere, Margaret Isioma; de Filippis, Renato; Ransing, Ramdas; Karaliuniene, Ruta; Ullah, Irfan; Bytyçi, Drita Gashi; Abbass, Zargham; Kilic, Ozge; Nahidi, Mahsa; Hayatudeen, Nafisatu; Nagendrappa, Sachin; Shoib, Sheikh; Jatchavala, Chonnakarn; Larnaout, Amine; Maiti, Tanay; Ogunnubi, Oluseun Peter; El Hayek, Samer; Bizri, Maya; Schuh Teixeira, Andre Luiz; Pereira-Sanchez, Victor; Da Costa, Mariana Pinto",Brain Behav Immun Health,871,18

One hundred fifty (N=150) officially enrolled students participated in the study, from private and state universities, composed of athletes, non-athletes, and inactive athletes. With the use of the Barriers to Being Active Quiz, comprising seven (7) barriers (Lack of Time (LT), Social Influence (SI), Lack of Energy (LE), Lack of Willpower (LW), Fear of Injury (FI), Lack of Skill (LS) and Lack of Resources (LR)), responses were collected adapted through online administration. After the response collection, results show high mean scores in LR and significantly low scores in FI and LS barriers among private and state university students. Private and State University students differ from each other significantly (p&lt;0.05) in the barriers SI, LW and LR, with state university students exhibiting greater mean scores. Active athletes possessed significantly lower scores during quarantine in most barriers (LT, SI, LE, LW, LS and LR), while inactive athletes exhibited the highest in FI. Further studies and examination of online physical education programmes are recommended to help students counter the reduced physical activity during quarantine, aside from strengthening government encouragement to those without access to exercise opportunities. © 2021 Montenegrin Sports Academy.

There is concern about whether cancer patients represent a especially vulnerable to population to this disease, and about the potential influence of different antineoplastic treatments on the risk of contracting the infection and its evolution. With this work, we intend to evaluate the impact of the first wave of the pandemic in our population of cancer patients, analyzing the characteristics and evolution of those patients admitted at our hospital with confirmed diagnosed of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as the presence of symptoms and acquired seroprevalence among patients under treatment with different antineoplastic drugs. This knowledge could help to optimize cancer patient management during this period of time, providing information on the risk and outcome of the infection for our patients, and the safety of cancer treatments. ABSTRACT: Background: Studies of patients with cancer affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are needed to assess the impact of the disease in this sensitive population, and the influence of different cancer treatments on the COVID-19 infection and seroconversion. Material and Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of all patients hospitalized with RT-PCR positive for COVID-19 in our region to assess the prevalence of cancer patients and describe their characteristics and evolution (Cohort 1). Concurrently, a transversal study was carried out in patients on active systemic cancer treatment for symptomatology and seroprevalence (IgG/IgM by ELISA-method) against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Cohort 2). Results: A total of 215 patients (Cohort 1) were admitted to hospital with a confirmed COVID-19 infection between February 28 and April 30, 2020, and 17 died (7.9%). A medical record of cancer was noted in 43 cases (20%), 6 of them required Intensive care unit ICU attention (14%), and 7 died (16%). There were thirty-six patients (83%) who tested IgG/IgM positive for SARS-CoV-2. Patients on immunosuppressive therapies presented a lower ratio of seroconversion (40% vs. 8%; p = 0.02). In Cohort 2, 166 patients were included in a symptoms-survey and tested for SARS-CoV-2. Any type of potential COVID-19-related symptom was referred up to 67.4% of patients (85.9% vs. 48.2% vs. 73.9%, for patients on chemotherapy, immunotherapy and targeted therapies respectively, p < 0.05). The seroprevalence ratio was 1.8% for the whole cohort with no significant differences by patient or treatment characteristics. Conclusion: Patients with cancer present higher risks for hospital needs for COVID-19 infection. The lack of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion may be a concern for patients on immunosuppressive therapies. Patients receiving systematic therapies relayed a high rate of potentially COVID-19-related symptoms, particularly those receiving chemotherapy. However, the seroconversion rate remains low and in the range of general population.","Garde-Noguera, Javier; Fernández-Murga, M.

However, since 2008 it seems that a new neonatal diarrhoeic syndrome unresponsive to antibiotics and common management practices has emerged. Routine laboratory examinations have not detected any pathogen related to this syndrome. The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate if well-known enteric pathogens could be associated with outbreaks of neonatal diarrhoea, thus question the hypotheses of a new syndrome. Furthermore, we wanted to evaluate macroscopic and microscopic findings associated with these outbreaks and if possible propose a preliminary piglet-level case-definition on syndrome New Neonatal Porcine Diarrhoea syndrome (NNPDS). RESULTS: Four well-managed herds experiencing neonatal diarrhoea with no previously established laboratory conclusion and suspected to suffer from New Neonatal Porcine Diarrhoea Syndrome, were selected. Within these herds, 51 diarrhoeic and 50 non-diarrhoeic piglets at the age of three to seven days were necropsied and subjected to histological and microbiological examination. Faeces were non-haemorrhagic. Neither enterotoxigenic E. coli, Clostridium perfringens type A or C, Clostridium difficile, rotavirus, coronavirus, Cryptosporidium spp, Giardia spp, Cystoisospora suis nor Strongyloides ransomi were associated with diarrhoea in the investigated outbreaks. Macroscopically, the diarrhoeic piglets were characterized by filled stomachs and flaccid intestines without mucosal changes. The predominant histological lesions were villous atrophy in jejunum and ileum. Epithelial lesions in colon were seen in one third of the case piglets. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study supported the hypothesis that a new neonatal porcine diarrhoea was present in the investigated herds, since no known pathogen(s) or management factors could explain the diarrhoeal outbreaks. Based on the findings in the four herds the following case-definition of NNPDS was suggested: Non-haemorrhagic diarrhoea during the first week of life, without detection of known infectious pathogens, characterized by milk-filled stomachs and flaccid intestines at necropsy.","Kongsted, Hanne; Jonach, Beata; Haugegaard, Svend; Angen, Øystein; Jorsal, Sven E; Kokotovic, Branko; Larsen, Lars E; Jensen, Tim K; Nielsen, Jens P",BMC Vet Res,871,22

Our purpose is to identify the frequency of atypical presentation and compare demographic and clinical factors, and short-term outcomes, between typical versus atypical presentations in OAs hospitalized with COVID-19 during the first surge of the pandemic. METHODS: Data from the inpatient electronic health record were extracted for patients aged 65 and older, admitted to our health systems’ hospitals with COVID-19 between March 1 and April 20, 2020. Presentation as reported by the OA or his/her representative is documented by the admitting professional and includes both symptoms and signs. Natural language processing was used to code the presence/absence of each symptom or sign. Typical presentation was defined as words indicating fever, cough, or shortness of breath; atypical presentation was defined as words indicating functional decline or altered mental status. RESULTS: Of 4 961 unique OAs, atypical presentation characterized by functional decline or altered mental status was present in 24.9% and 11.3%, respectively. Atypical presentation was associated with older age, female gender, Black race, non-Hispanic ethnicity, higher comorbidity index, and the presence of dementia and diabetes mellitus. Those who presented typically were 1.39 times more likely than those who presented atypically to receive intensive care unit–level care. Hospital outcomes of mortality, length of stay, and 30-day readmission were similar between OAs with typical versus atypical presentations. CONCLUSION: Although atypical presentation in OAs is not associated with the same need for acute intervention as respiratory distress, it must not be dismissed.","Marziliano, Allison; Burns, Edith; Chauhan, Lakshpaul; Liu, Yan; Makhnevich, Alex; Zhang, Meng; Carney, Maria T; Dbeis, Yasser; Lindvall, Charlotta; Qiu, Michael; Diefenbach, Michael A; Sinvani, Liron",J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci,871,21

Objectives: To assess the incidence of pulmonary cavitation and describe its characteristics and evolution. Methods: A retrospective review of all patients admitted to our institution with COVID-19 was undertaken and imaging reviewed to identify patients who developed pulmonary cavitation. Results: Twelve out of 689 (1.7%) patients admitted to our institution with COVID-19 developed pulmonary cavitation, comprising 3.3% (n=12/359) of those with COVID-19 pneumonia, and 11% (n=12/110) of those admitted to the intensive care unit. We describe the imaging characteristics of the cavitation and present the clinical, pharmacological, laboratory, and microbiological parameters for these patients. In this cohort six patients have died while another remains critically ill and unlikely to survive. Conclusion: Cavitary lung disease in patients with severe COVID-19 disease is not uncommon, and is associated with a high level of morbidity and mortality.","Zoumot, Z.; Bonilla, M.-F.; Wahla, A.
