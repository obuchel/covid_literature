548,548,548,Monitoring Influenza Activity in the United States: A Comparison of Traditional Surveillance Systems with Google Flu Trends,15.381232,5.252165,2011-04-27,"BACKGROUND: Google Flu Trends was developed to estimate US influenza-like illness (ILI) rates from internet searches; however ILI does not necessarily correlate with actual influenza virus infections. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Influenza activity data from 2003–04 through 2007–08 were obtained from three US surveillance systems: Google Flu Trends, CDC Outpatient ILI Surveillance Network (CDC ILI Surveillance), and US Influenza Virologic Surveillance System (CDC Virus Surveillance). Pearson's correlation coefficients with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated to compare surveillance data. An analysis was performed to investigate outlier observations and determine the extent to which they affected the correlations between surveillance data. Pearson's correlation coefficient describing Google Flu Trends and CDC Virus Surveillance over the study period was 0.72 (95% CI: 0.64, 0.79). The correlation between CDC ILI Surveillance and CDC Virus Surveillance over the same period was 0.85 (95% CI: 0.81, 0.89). Most of the outlier observations in both comparisons were from the 2003–04 influenza season. Exclusion of the outlier observations did not substantially improve the correlation between Google Flu Trends and CDC Virus Surveillance (0.82; 95% CI: 0.76, 0.87) or CDC ILI Surveillance and CDC Virus Surveillance (0.86; 95%CI: 0.82, 0.90). CONCLUSIONS: This analysis demonstrates that while Google Flu Trends is highly correlated with rates of ILI, it has a lower correlation with surveillance for laboratory-confirmed influenza. Most of the outlier observations occurred during the 2003–04 influenza season that was characterized by early and intense influenza activity, which potentially altered health care seeking behavior, physician testing practices, and internet search behavior.","Ortiz, Justin R.; Zhou, Hong; Shay, David K.; Neuzil, Kathleen M.; Fowlkes, Ashley L.; Goss, Christopher H.",PLoS One,207,1
1502,1502,1502,Plasma kallistatin levels in patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia,15.526093,10.245729,2013-02-08,"INTRODUCTION: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) requiring intensive care unit (ICU) treatment commonly causes acute respiratory failure with high mortality. Kallistatin, an endogenous tissue kallikrein inhibitor, has been reported to be protective in various human diseases. The aim of this study was to assess the correlations of kallistatin with other biomarkers and to determine whether kallistatin levels have a prognostic value in severe CAP. METHODS: Plasma samples and clinical data were prospectively collected from 54 patients with severe CAP requiring ICU admission. Seventeen healthy control subjects were included for comparison. Plasma kallistatin, kallikrein, and other biomarkers of inflammation (tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, C-reactive protein (CRP)), and anti-coagulation (protein C, anti-thrombin III) were measured on days 1 and 4 of ICU admission. Comparison between survivors (n = 41) and nonsurvivors (n = 13) was performed. RESULTS: Plasma kallistatin was significantly consumed in severe CAP patients compared with healthy individuals. Lower day 1 kallistatin levels showed a strong trend toward increased mortality (P = 0.018) and higher day 1 CURB-65 scores (P = 0.004). Plasma kallistatin levels on day 1 of ICU admission were significantly decreased in patients who developed septic shock (P = 0.017) and who had acute respiratory distress syndrome (P = 0.044). In addition, kallistatin levels were positively correlated with anti-thrombin III and protein C and inversely correlated with IL-1β, IL-6, and CRP levels. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, higher day 1 CURB-65 scores were independent predictors of mortality (odds ratio = 29.9; P = 0.009). Also, higher day 1 kallistatin levels were independently associated with a decreased risk of death (odds ratio, 0.1) with a nearly significant statistical difference (P = 0.056). Furthermore, we found that a cutoff level of 6.5 μg/ml of day 1 kallistatin determined by receiver operating characteristic curves could be used to distinguish between patients who survived in 60 days and those who did not. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that kallistatin may serve as a novel marker for severe CAP prognosis and may be involved in the pathogenesis of CAP through antiinflammatory and anticoagulation effects.

Here, we evaluated whether the sequence similarity of various antigens to the microbiota dampens or increases immunogenicity of T cell epitopes. Sets of epitopes and control sequences derived from 38 antigenic categories (infectious pathogens, allergens, autoantigens) were retrieved from the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB). Their similarity to microbiome sequences was calculated using the BLOSUM62 matrix. We found that sequence similarity was associated with either dampened (tolerogenic; e.g. most allergens) or increased (inflammatory; e.g. Dengue and West Nile viruses) likelihood of a peptide being immunogenic as a function of epitope source category. Ten-fold cross-validation and validation using sets of manually curated epitopes and non-epitopes derived from allergens were used to confirm these initial observations. Furthermore, the genus from which the microbiome homologous sequences were derived influenced whether a tolerogenic versus inflammatory modulatory effect was observed, with Fusobacterium most associated with inflammatory influences and Bacteroides most associated with tolerogenic influences. We validated these effects using PBMCs stimulated with various sets of microbiome peptides. “Tolerogenic” microbiome peptides elicited IL-10 production, “inflammatory” peptides elicited mixed IL-10/IFNγ production, while microbiome epitopes homologous to self were completely unreactive for both cytokines. We also tested the sequence similarity of cockroach epitopes to specific microbiome sequences derived from households of cockroach allergic individuals and non-allergic controls. Microbiomes from cockroach allergic households were less likely to contain sequences homologous to previously defined cockroach allergens. These results are compatible with the hypothesis that microbiome sequences may contribute to the tolerization of T cells for allergen epitopes, and lack of these sequences might conversely be associated with increased likelihood of T cell reactivity against the cockroach epitopes. Taken together this study suggests that microbiome sequence similarity influences immune reactivity to homologous epitopes encoded by pathogens, allergens and auto-antigens.","Carrasco Pro, Sebastian; Lindestam Arlehamn, Cecilia S.; Dhanda, Sandeep K.; Carpenter, Chelsea; Lindvall, Mikaela; Faruqi, Ali A.; Santee, Clark A.; Renz, Harald; Sidney, John; Peters, Bjoern; Sette, Alessandro",PLoS One,207,17

A multicenter prospective cohort study was carried out. All adult patients admitted to 13 hospitals in Spain with confirmed influenza A 2009 (H1N1) virus infection from June 12, 2009 to November 11, 2009 were included. Risk factors for complicated influenza infection were studied in immunosuppressed patients. Overall, 559 patients were included, of which 56 were immunosuppressed, nine with solid or hematological malignancies, 18 with solid-organ transplant recipients, 13 with corticosteroid therapy, and six with other types of immunosuppression. Clinical findings at diagnosis were similar in both groups. Nineteen immunosuppressed patients had pneumonia (33.9%). Immunosuppressed patients with pandemic influenza had bacterial co-infection more frequently (17.9% vs. 6.4%, p = 0.02), specifically, gram-negative bacilli and Staphylococcus aureus infections. Mortality was higher in immunosuppressed patients (7.1% vs. 1.8%, p < 0.05). The only modifiable risk factor of complicated influenza A 2009 (H1N1) was delayed antiviral therapy. In immunosuppressed patients, influenza A 2009 (H1N1) virus infection has higher mortality than in non-immunosuppressed individuals. Bacterial co-infection is common in complicated cases.","Cordero, E.; Aydillo, T.; Fariñas, M. C.; Paño-Pardo, J.

Membrane segregated cultures were used so that the influences of direct B-T cell contact and T cell factors on B cell differentiation could be independently evaluated. B-T cell contact was not absolutely required for Pb's enhancement of B cell maturation to antibody forming cells (AFCs); however, enhancement of the AFC response by Pb was optimal when B-T cell interactions were allowed. These results were corroborated by use of anti-L3T4 (mouse CD4) to block CD4(+) T cell-B cell interaction. Blockade of B-T cell contact with anti-L3T4 did not inhibit the enhancement of the AFC response by Pb. Additional experimentation showed that Pb enhanced the AFC response and Ig production in the presence of antigen-specific T cell help, suggesting that Pb enhances B cell differentiation by augmenting cognate help rather than by inducing a response to Pb-altered-self. In studies employing antigen-specific T cell clones, Pb was found to differentially modulate antigen presentation to T(H1) versus T(H2) T cell clones, in that T(H1) activation was inhibited and T(H2) activation was enhanced by Pb.","McCabe, Michael J.; Lawrence, David A.",Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,207,16

These changes will impact on the dynamics of riverine carbon cycles and food web structure and function. Here we investigate the principal sources of organic carbon supporting local shredder communities across a gradient in different levels of anthropogenic development along riverine reaches, in South Australia. In forested/wooded reaches with minimum to limited development, semi‐emergent macrophytes were the principal sources of organic carbon supporting the local shredder communities. However, in developed reaches, course particulate organic matter and filamentous algae were the principal food sources. The C:N ratios of the food sources in developed reaches were higher than those of their consumers indicating a stoichiometric mismatch. This imbalanced consumer‐resource nutrient ratio in those developed reaches is likely to impose constraints on the growth and reproduction of their aquatic shredder communities with probable knock‐on effects to higher trophic levels.","DEEGAN, BRIAN M.; GANF, GEORGE G.",Austral Ecol,207,1

RECENT FINDINGS: A profibrotic immune response characterizes TBP, with low levels of AcSDKP, high levels of γ-interferon and IL-10 in the pericardium, and high levels of TGF-β and IL-10 in the blood. These findings may have implications for future therapeutic targets. Despite advances in nucleic acid amplification approaches, these tests remain disappointing for TBP. Trials of corticosteroids and colchicine have had mixed results, with no impact on mortality, evidence of a reduction in rates of constrictive pericarditis and potential harm in those with advanced HIV. Small studies suggest that ATT penetrates the pericardium poorly. Given that there is a close association between high bacillary burden and mortality, a rethink about the optimal drug doses and duration may be required. SUMMARY: The high mortality and morbidity from TBP despite use of anti-tuberculous drugs call for researches targeting host-directed immunological determinants of treatment outcome. There is also a need for the identification of steps in clinical management where interventions are needed to improve outcomes.

The association of burnout with compassion satisfaction, secondary stress, emotional coping strategies and many psychosocial variables, such as institutional support, friendship, and spirituality, have not been well studied. A convenience sample of internal medicine physicians was emailed a survey using validated instruments to explore these associations. The response rate was 337/1021 (33%), with a burnout prevalence of 175/337 (52%). Grit, acceptance, active coping, positive reframing, and strategy planning were associated with lower burnout domains and greater compassion satisfaction. Certain emotional coping strategies such as denial, disengagement, self-blame, substance abuse, and venting were associated with greater burnout and lower compassion satisfaction. Greater institutional support was associated with lower burnout (r = − .35, p < .001), secondary stress (r = − .14, p < .05), and compassion satisfaction (r = .28, p < .0001). Friendship was associated with lower burnout (r = − .25, p < .0001) and greater compassion satisfaction (r = .28, p < .0001).

The aims were to describe the characteristics of different types of hospital-at-home (HaH), assess their results, and examine which factors could be related to these results. A cross-sectional study based on data from all 2014 HaH contacts from Catalonia was designed. The following HaH modalities were considered—admission avoidance (n = 7214; 75.1%) and early assisted discharge (n = 2387; 24.9%). The main outcome indicators were readmission, mortality, and length of stay (days). Multivariable models were fitted to assess the association between explanatory factors and outcomes. Hospital admission avoidance is a scheme in which, instead of being admitted to acute care hospitals, patients are directly treated in their own homes. Early assisted discharge is a scheme in which hospital in-care patients continue their treatment at home. In the hospital avoidance modality, there were 8.3% readmissions, 0.9% mortality, and a mean length of stay (SD) of 9.6 (10.6) days. In the early assisted discharge modality, these figures were 7.9%, 0.5%, and 9.8 (11.1), respectively. In both modalities, readmission and mean length of stay were related to comorbidity and type of hospital, and mortality with age. The results of HaH in Catalonia are similar to those observed in other contexts. The factors related to these results identified might help to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the different HaH modalities.","Arias-de la Torre, Jorge; Zioga, Evangelia Anna María; Macorigh, Lizza; Muñoz, Laura; Estrada, Oriol; Mias, Montse; Estrada, Maria-Dolors; Puigdomenech, Elisa; Valderas, Jose M.; Martín, Vicente; Molina, Antonio J.; Espallargues, Mireia",J Clin Med,207,1

Yet, while the former has been extensively characterized, the computational organization of the latter remains largely unknown. Here, we use magneto-encephalography to localize, track and decode the feedforward and recurrent processes of reading, as elicited by letters and digits whose level of ambiguity was parametrically manipulated. We first confirm that a feedforward response propagates through the ventral and dorsal pathways within the first 200 ms. The subsequent activity is distributed across temporal, parietal and prefrontal cortices, which sequentially generate five levels of representations culminating in action-specific motor signals. Our decoding analyses reveal that both the content and the timing of these brain responses are best explained by a hierarchy of recurrent neural assemblies, which both maintain and broadcast increasingly rich representations. Together, these results show how recurrent processes generate, over extended time periods, a cascade of decisions that ultimately accounts for subjects’ perceptual reports and reaction times.","Gwilliams, Laura; King, Jean-Remi",,207,12

Under normal conditions, vWF is cleaved by the metalloprotease ADAMTS-13. After trauma, ADAMTS-13 levels are reduced. OBJECTIVES: To assess whether recombinant human ADAMTS-13 inhibits endothelial injury and organ failure in a rat trauma-transfusion model. METHODS: Blood products were prepared from syngeneic rat blood according to blood bank standards. Polytrauma was induced in rats by crush injury to the intestines and liver and by fracture of the femur. The rats were hemorrhaged until a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 40 mmHg was reached. Rats were randomized to receive transfusion of RBCs, FFPs, and platelets in a 1:1:1 ratio to achieve a MAP of 70 mmHg, with or without the addition of ADAMTS-13 (50 μg/kg). Blood samples were assessed for biochemistry and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM). Syndecan-1 and VE-cadherin levels were measured as a reflection of endothelial integrity. The amount of leakage of dextran-FITC from the vascular system to the parenchyma in lungs was quantified. To assess inflammation, IL-6 and IL-8 levels were determined. Organ damage was assessed by histopathology. RESULTS: All rats were severely shocked, with no significant differences in shock parameters between groups. Rats treated with ADAMTS-13 showed signs of a more effective shock reversal (higher blood pressure, lower lactate levels) compared to controls. Also, ROTEM parameters of clot formation in rats receiving ADAMTS-13 improved compared to controls, which was mainly platelet-dependent. Syndecan-1 levels relative to baseline trended to be lower in ADAMTS-13 treated rats compared to controls (107 vs 149%, p = 0.08). ADAMTS-13 reduced albuminuria (1.7 vs 4.4 g/L, p < 0.01) and organ-specific inflammation (pulmonary IL-6 243 vs 369 pg/mL, p = 0.08; splenic IL-6 253 vs 307, p = 0.03) compared to controls, but did not improve histopathological scores. CONCLUSIONS: The use of ADAMTS-13 in a rat trauma-transfusion model improves parameters of shock, platelet-driven coagulation, endothelial damage, and organ inflammation. These results suggest that ADAMTS-13 is important in mediating outcome of trauma. Whether ADAMTS-13 can be used as a therapeutic adjunct to treat bleeding trauma patients remains to be determined.","Wirtz, Mathijs R.; van den Brink, Daan P.; Roelofs, Joris J. T. H.; Goslings, J.

Lactoferrin (Lf) is a cationic nonheme multifunctional glycoprotein of the innate immune system of mammals that provides numerous benefits. Lf is bacteriostatic and/or bactericidal, can stimulate cell proliferation and differentiation, facilitate iron absorption, improve neural development and cognition, promote bone growth, prevent cancer and exert anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory effects. Lactoferrin is present in colostrum and milk and is also produced by the secondary granules of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, which store this glycoprotein and release it at sites of infection. Lf is also present in many fluids and exocrine secretions, on the surfaces of the digestive, respiratory and reproductive systems that are commonly exposed to pathogens. Apo-Lf (an iron-free molecule) can be microbiostatic due to its ability to capture ferric iron, blocking the availability of host iron to pathogens. However, apo-Lf is mostly microbicidal via its interaction with the microbial surface, causing membrane damage and altering its permeability function. Lf can inhibit viral entry by binding to cell receptors or viral particles. Lf is also able to counter different important mechanisms evolved by microbial pathogens to infect and invade the host, such as adherence, colonization, invasion, production of biofilms and production of virulence factors such as proteases and toxins. Lf can also cause mitochondrial and caspase-dependent regulated cell death and apoptosis-like in pathogenic yeasts. All of these mechanisms are important targets for treatment with Lf. Holo-Lf (the iron-saturated molecule) can contain up to two ferric ions and can also be microbicidal against some pathogens. On the other hand, lactoferricins (Lfcins) are peptides derived from the N-terminus of Lf that are produced by proteolysis with pepsin under acidic conditions, and they cause similar effects on pathogens to those caused by the parental Lf. Synthetic analog peptides comprising the N-terminus Lf region similarly exhibit potent antimicrobial properties. Importantly, there are no reported pathogens that are resistant to Lf and Lfcins; in addition, Lf and Lfcins have shown a synergistic effect with antimicrobial and antiviral drugs. Due to the Lf properties being microbiostatic, microbicidal, anti-inflammatory and an immune modulator, it represents an excellent natural alternative either alone or as adjuvant in the combat to antibiotic multidrug-resistant bacteria and other pathogens. This review aimed to evaluate the data that appeared in the literature about the effects of Lf and its derived peptides on pathogenic bacteria, protozoa, fungi and viruses and how Lf and Lfcins inhibit the mechanisms developed by these pathogens to cause disease.","Zarzosa-Moreno, Daniela; Avalos-Gómez, Christian; Ramírez-Texcalco, Luisa Sofía; Torres-López, Erick; Ramírez-Mondragón, Ricardo; Hernández-Ramírez, Juan Omar; Serrano-Luna, Jesús; de la Garza, Mireya",Molecules,207,1

METHODS: In the Einstein Aging Study, a diverse community cohort (n = 428; mean age = 78.1; 66% female; 54% non‐White), equivalence testing was used to examine concordance between the T‐MoCA and the corresponding in‐person MoCA assessment. Receiver operating characteristic analyses examined the diagnostic ability to discriminate between mild cognitive impairment and normal cognition. Conversion methods from T‐MoCA to the MoCA are presented. RESULTS: Education, race/ethnicity, gender, age, self‐reported cognitive concerns, and telephone administration difficulties were associated with both modes of administration; however, when examining the difference between modalities, these factors were not significant. Sensitivity and specificity for the T‐MoCA (using Youden's index optimal cut) were 72% and 59%, respectively. DISCUSSION: The T‐MoCA demonstrated sufficient psychometric properties to be useful for screening of MCI, especially when clinic visits are not feasible.","Katz, Mindy J.; Wang, Cuiling; Nester, Caroline O.; Derby, Carol A.; Zimmerman, Molly E.; Lipton, Richard B.; Sliwinski, Martin J.; Rabin, Laura A.",Alzheimers Dement (Amst),207,1

For example, this is true in combustion models (many transient chemical species are not of interest in a given reaction) and in epidemiological models (only certain subpopulations are consequential). Thus, it is common to use greatly reduced or partial models in which only the interactions among the species of interest are known. In this work, we explore the use of an embedded, sparse, and data-driven discrepancy operator to augment these partial interaction models. Preliminary results show that the model error caused by severe reductions—e.g., elimination of hundreds of terms—can be captured with sparse operators, built with only a small fraction of that number. The operator is embedded within the differential equations of the model, which allows the action of the operator to be interpretable. Moreover, it is constrained by available physical information and calibrated over many scenarios. These qualities of the discrepancy model—interpretability, physical consistency, and robustness to different scenarios—are intended to support reliable predictions under extrapolative conditions.","Morrison, Rebecca E.",Entropy (Basel),207,22

Health information technologies (HITs) show promising potential to overcome these barriers. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify how best to improve a mental health and well-being HIT for culturally diverse Australians in nonurban areas. METHODS: We conducted 10 co-design workshops (N=105 participants) in primary youth mental health services across predominantly nonurban areas of Australia and conducted template analysis on the workshop outputs. Owing to local (including service) demographics, the workshop participants naturalistically reflected culturally diverse groups. RESULTS: We identified 4 main themes: control, usability, affirmation, and health service delivery factors. The first 3 themes overlap with the 3 basic needs postulated by self-determination theory (autonomy, competence, and relatedness) and describe participant recommendations on how to design an HIT. The final theme includes barriers to adopting HITs for mental health care and how HITs can be used to support care coordination and delivery. Hence, it describes participant recommendations on how to use an HIT. CONCLUSIONS: Although culturally diverse groups have specific concerns, their expressed needs fall broadly within the relatively universal design principles identified in this study. The findings of this study provide further support for applying self-determination theory to the design of HITs and reflect the tension in designing technologies for complex problems that overlap multiple medical, regulatory, and social domains, such as mental health care. Finally, we synthesize the identified themes into general recommendations for designing HITs for mental health and provide concrete examples of design features recommended by participants.","Cheng, Vanessa Wan Sze; Piper, Sarah E; Ottavio, Antonia; Davenport, Tracey A; Hickie, Ian B",J Med Internet Res,207,1

Despite significant advances in the diagnosing and treatment of OSA, patients’ overall survival has not improved within the last twenty years. Lately, advances in modern nanotechnology have spurred development in OSA management and offered several advantages to overcome the drawbacks of conventional therapies. This technology has allowed the practical design of nanoscale devices combined with numerous functional molecules, including tumor-specific ligands, antibodies, anti-cancer drugs, and imaging probes. Thanks to their small sizes, desirable drug encapsulation efficiency, and good bioavailability, functionalized nanomaterials have found wide-spread applications for combating OSA progression.

Therefore, in this study, we aimed to assess the incidence of syncope associated with acute principal diseases (APDs) and to identify predictive factors reflecting the presence of these underlying conditions. We retrospectively evaluated all patients presenting with syncope during a 6-month period to the local emergency department, collecting incidence of syncopal cases associated with APDs, personal information, clinical features, and laboratory abnormalities, which were compared between syncopal patients with or without APDs. A syncope-associated APD could be diagnosed in 346/1279 patients (27.1%). In the majority of cases, the cause was a non-cardiovascular acute condition (67%), mostly non-life-threatening such as infectious diseases (34.4%) and acute diseases with pain, fluid loss or hypotension (23.7%). Severe acute cardiovascular conditions were less frequent (4.2%). Cardiogenic syncope, no previous history of syncopal episodes, not full agreement with typical clinical features of syncope, alterations of vital parameters, and laboratory abnormalities were also found to be independently associated with syncope-associated APDs. Syncope may be frequently associated with APDs of varying severity, though mostly non-clinically threatening, thus confirming that this condition shall be considered a symptom and not a disease. Emergency physicians should hence be first engaged in troubleshooting an underlying pathology when facing patients with syncope, for timely identifying patients at higher risk of short-term adverse events and reducing inappropriate admissions and diagnostic investigations, especially in the presence of hypotensive syncope elicited by non-severe concurrent conditions.

Here we aim to validate using the INSPIRIS RESILIA valve with minimally invasive RAMT. METHODS: Between April 2017 and June 2019, 100 patients underwent video-assisted minimally invasive AVR by RAMT, using the INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic valve. Cannulation for cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was through femoral vessels. Clinical data were prospectively entered into our institutional database. RESULTS: Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and cross-clamping times were 79 ± 38 and 41 ± 17 min. Surgical access was successful in 100% of cases. There were no cases of intraoperative mortality, 30-day mortality, cerebrovascular events, rethoracotomy for bleeding, valve-related reoperation, right internal mammary artery injury, or conversion to sternotomy. Intensive care and hospital stays were 2 ± 1 and 6 ± 3 days, respectively. One patient had a pacemaker fitted. Postoperative dialysis was necessary in one patient. Trace to mild aortic valve regurgitation occurred in two patients. No structural valve deterioration (SVD) and paravalvular leak were seen. At 1-year follow-up mean effective orifice area (EOA) was 1.8 ± 0.1 cm(2), peak gradient was 22.1 ± 3.1 mmHg, and mean gradient was 11.5 ± 2.3 mmHg. CONCLUSION: Our preliminary experience suggests that RAMT for AVR using the INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic valve is safe, effective, and reproducible.

We aimed to assess HIV incidence and HIV mortality for all second-level administrative units across sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: In this modelling study, we developed a framework that used the geographically specific HIV prevalence data collected in seroprevalence surveys and antenatal care clinics to train a model that estimates HIV incidence and mortality among individuals aged 15–49 years. We used a model-based geostatistical framework to estimate HIV prevalence at the second administrative level in 44 countries in sub-Saharan Africa for 2000–18 and sought data on the number of individuals on antiretroviral therapy (ART) by second-level administrative unit. We then modified the Estimation and Projection Package (EPP) to use these HIV prevalence and treatment estimates to estimate HIV incidence and mortality by second-level administrative unit. FINDINGS: The estimates suggest substantial variation in HIV incidence and mortality rates both between and within countries in sub-Saharan Africa, with 15 countries having a ten-times or greater difference in estimated HIV incidence between the second-level administrative units with the lowest and highest estimated incidence levels. Across all 44 countries in 2018, HIV incidence ranged from 2·8 (95% uncertainty interval 2·1–3·8) in Mauritania to 1585·9 (1369·4–1824·8) cases per 100 000 people in Lesotho and HIV mortality ranged from 0·8 (0·7–0·9) in Mauritania to 676·5 (513·6–888·0) deaths per 100 000 people in Lesotho. Variation in both incidence and mortality was substantially greater at the subnational level than at the national level and the highest estimated rates were accordingly higher. Among second-level administrative units, Guijá District, Gaza Province, Mozambique, had the highest estimated HIV incidence (4661·7 [2544·8–8120·3]) cases per 100 000 people in 2018 and Inhassunge District, Zambezia Province, Mozambique, had the highest estimated HIV mortality rate (1163·0 [679·0–1866·8]) deaths per 100 000 people. Further, the rate of reduction in HIV incidence and mortality from 2000 to 2018, as well as the ratio of new infections to the number of people living with HIV was highly variable. Although most second-level administrative units had declines in the number of new cases (3316 [81·1%] of 4087 units) and number of deaths (3325 [81·4%]), nearly all appeared well short of the targeted 75% reduction in new cases and deaths between 2010 and 2020. INTERPRETATION: Our estimates suggest that most second-level administrative units in sub-Saharan Africa are falling short of the targeted 75% reduction in new cases and deaths by 2020, which is further compounded by substantial within-country variability. These estimates will help decision makers and programme implementers expand access to ART and better target health resources to higher burden subnational areas.

In light of recent concerns, the aim of this research was to explore contemporary influences on dentists' health and wellbeing in England, drawing on their lived experience. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of dentists working in England, taking into account age, gender, career stage, work sector, geographical area, position and route of entry to registration. A topic guide, informed by the literature, was used to guide the discourse. Dentists were approached via gatekeepers, supported by snowball sampling. Interviews were recorded and transcribed for analysis. Framework analysis was used, taking an interpretative phenomenological approach to develop theory. Results Twenty dentists, from a range of backgrounds, participated in this research. While health and wellbeing was reported to be more positive among dentists in their later career, those in their early career and/or with high NHS work commitments shared concerns about their physical, psychological and emotional health. Influences ranged from macro-level issues relating to professional regulation and health systems, through meso-level, notably their workplace and job specification, to micro-level issues relating to their professional careers, relationships and personal life. Dentists highlighted ethical concerns and feeling driven to deliver, together with being demoralised by a survival culture, all leading to perceived lack of control and reduced professional fulfilment. In contrast, being able to deliver quality care, innovate and effect change, as well as being valued for their delivery, were perceived to positively contribute to general health and wellbeing. Conclusion Dentists have a vital role in providing care for patients, so there are serious public health implications if urgent action is not taken to improve and sustain their health and wellbeing. This study confirms that dentists are affected by multiple contemporary influences, and although greater support is needed for individuals, organisational, system and policy changes may be required to fully address the challenges they face.

METHODS: First, we developed a competency draft by reviewing the literature on oral hygiene care of patients in the intensive care unit. Next, we developed expert validity test questionnaires using this draft and conducted expert validity tests twice on 18 experts. We determined competency as a content validity index of 0.8 or more and received expert additive opinions about competency through an open-questionnaire expert validity test paper in this methodology study. RESULTS: The content validity index ranged from 0.8 ~ 1.0 for all items. The competency of ‘professionalism’ comprised 2 sub-competencies with 7 behavioral indicators. ‘POHC preparation’ comprised 3 sub-competencies with 10 behavioral indicators. ‘POHC implementation’ comprised 3 sub-competencies with 6 behavioral indicators. ‘POHC evaluation’ comprised 2 sub-competencies with 8 behavioral indicators. Lastly ‘Cooperation among experts’ comprised 3 sub-competencies with 7 behavioral indicatiors.

This study aims to offer novel information on the mode of action of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)-modulating drug by assessing lung structure and function using functional respiratory imaging (FRI). METHODS: CF patients aged ⩾12 years homozygous for F508del were recruited in an open-label study. Before and after 12 weeks of treatment with LUM/IVA, FRI was used to visualize regional information, such as air trapping, lobar volume and airway wall volume. Secondary outcomes included the CF-CT scoring system, spirometry, the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire–Revised (CFQ-R) questionnaire, exercise tolerance and nutritional status. RESULTS: Of the 12 patients enrolled in the study, 11 completed all study visits. Concerning the FRI parameters, hyperinflation of the lung decreased, indicated by a reduction in air trapping and lobar volume at expiration. Also, a decrease in airway wall volume and a redistribution of pulmonary blood volume were noted, which might be related to a decrease in mucus impaction. Airway resistance, airway volume, internal airflow distribution and aerosol deposition pattern did not show significant changes. No significant improvements were found in any of the CF-CT scores or in the spirometric parameters. Other secondary outcomes showed similar results compared with previous research. Correlations at baseline were found between FRI and conventional outcomes, including physical functioning, spirometry and CF-CT scores. CONCLUSIONS: LUM/IVA decreased lung hyperinflation in combination with a potential decrease in mucus impaction, which can be related to an improved mucociliary transport. These results indicate that several FRI parameters, reflecting regional and distal lung structures, are more sensitive to changes caused by LUM/IVA than conventional respiratory outcomes.","Lauwers, Eline; Belmans, Dennis; Mignot, Benjamin; Ides, Kris; Van Hoorenbeeck, Kim; Snoeckx, Annemiek; Van Holsbeke, Cedric; Nowé, Vicky; Van Braeckel, Eva; De Backer, Wilfried; De Backer, Jan; Verhulst, Stijn",Ther Adv Respir Dis,207,1

Studies have suggested the individual role of probiotics and metformin Met in protecting intestinal barrier function from injuries induced by ethanol. The objective of the current study is to investigate the potential mechanism by which coadministration of probiotic Visbiome® (V) and Met blocks the ethanol-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction/gut leakiness utilizing Caco-2 monolayers, a rat model with chronic ethanol injury, and in silico docking interaction models. In Caco-2 monolayers, exposure to ethanol significantly disrupted tight junction (TJ) localization, elevated monolayer permeability, and oxidative stress compared with controls. However, cotreatment with probiotic V and Met largely ameliorated the ethanol-induced mucosal barrier dysfunction, TJ disruption, and gut oxidative stress compared with ethanol-exposed monolayers and individual treatment of either agent. Rats fed with ethanol-containing Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet showed decreased expression of TJ proteins, and increased intestinal barrier injury resulting in pro-inflammatory response and oxidative stress in the colon. We found that co-administration of probiotic V and Met improved the expression of intestinal TJ proteins (ZO-1 and occludin) and upregulated the anti-inflammatory response, leading to reduced ER stress. Moreover, co-administration of probiotic V and Met inhibited the CYP2E1 and NOX gene expression, and increase the translocation of Nrf-2 as well as anti-oxidative genes (SOD, catalase, Gpx, and HO-1), leading to reduced colonic ROS content and malondialdehyde levels. The combined treatment of probiotic V and Met also improved their binding affinities towards HO-1, Nrf-2, SLC5A8, and GPR109A, which could be attributed to their synergistic effect. Our findings based on in-vitro, in-vivo, and in-silico analyses suggest that the combination of probiotic V and Met potentially acts in synergism, attributable to their property of inhibition of inflammation and oxidative stress against ethanol-induced intestinal barrier injury.","Patel, Farhin; Parwani, Kirti; Rao, Priyashi; Patel, Dhara; Rawal, Rakesh; Mandal, Palash",Mediators Inflamm,207,19

Of note, one or more of these objectives may be pursued in a particular situation; for example, in a patient with acute leukemia, transplantation aims to replace the neoplastic hematopoiesis by administering high-dose cytotoxic therapy and taking advantage of the graft-versus-leukemia effect of donor T-lymphocytes from the graft.

Assessing the BW threat is challenging, however, because illicit development and production can be concealed at dual-use industrial sites such as vaccine plants, and only tens of kilograms of an agent like dried anthrax spores can be militarily significant. The lack of unambiguous technical signatures of BW-related activity means that most estimates of foreign capabilities draw heavily on human intelligence sources, yet spies and defectors are notoriously unreliable. A key factor driving BW proliferation is the perceived military utility of biological weapons, which may include strategic deterrence, asymmetric warfare, or covert operations. Globalization of the biotechnology industry has expanded trade in dual-use materials and production equipment, increasing the risks of diversion and misuse for BW purposes. With the advent of flexible biological manufacturing systems, it has also become possible for countries to acquire a “latent” capacity for BW production during a crisis or war. Since the 2001 anthrax letter attacks, sub-state actors have become a prominent part of the threat matrix, but terrorist acquisition and use of BW requires both the motivation to use disease as a weapon and the technical capability to do so, a combination that is quite rare. At present the threat of mass-casualty BW attacks emanates primarily from nation-states, while terrorist use of biological weapons will likely remain limited in scale and impact. Nevertheless, the emergence of new biotechnologies with a potential for misuse could result in more damaging incidents of bioterrorism in the future.","Tucker, Jonathan B.",Biopreparedness and Public Health,207,12

The proposed model is validated on sampled and real remote sensing images and the results obtained outperform those produced by conventional hidden Markov fields.","Boudaren, Mohamed El Yazid; Hamache, Ali; Debicha, Islam; Sadouk, Hamza Tarik",Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems,207,16

While several studies have explored this gender gap, none has attempted to isolate the psychological processes underpinning this phenomenon. In this research note, I suggest that sexism partly explains these differences. Using data from a large (N = 100,689) survey of American adults conducted between March and June 2020 by the Democracy Fund and the University of California, Los Angeles (Nationscape), I find that sexist beliefs, a component of masculine norms, are consistently the strongest predictor of coronavirus-related emotions, behaviors, policy attitudes, and ultimately contracting COVID-19. This study highlights how gender ideology can impact health and impede government public health efforts.","Reny, Tyler T.",,207,31

With support from social identity theory, the current study sheds light on the understudied role of the dark side of organizational identification by investigating its indirect effects on (a) psychological entitlement, (b) unethical pro-organizational behavior, and (c) pro-social rule-breaking through externally motivated organizational citizenship behavior, taking leader–member exchange as a boundary condition. Two surveys were conducted to test the proposed moderated mediation model. Data for the study 1 was collected from employees (N = 356) working in the service sector (i.e., Universities, Banks and Telecommunication Organizations), whereas responses for study 2 were taken from employees (N = 259) working in the hospitality industry. A time-lagged research design was selected for both surveys to avoid common method bias. The results demonstrate that organizational identification leads to adverse outcomes in the form of psychological entitlement, pro-social rule-breaking and unethical pro-organizational behavior through externally motivated organizational citizenship behavior. Furthermore, a high-quality leader–member exchange relationship enhances these indirect effects of organizational identification. Several theoretical and practical implications, along with limitations and future research directions, are also discussed.","Irshad, Muhammad; Bashir, Sajid",Front Psychol,207,1

We aimed to describe clinical characteristics and early outcomes of the older Covid-19 patients hospitalized in our center comparatively with the younger patients, and also to analyze the triage factors that were related to the in-hospital mortality of older adults. DESIGN: Retrospective; observational study. SETTING: Istanbul Faculty of Medicine hospital, Turkey. PARTICIPANTS: 362 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from March 11 to May 11, 2020. MEASUREMENTS: The demographic information; associated comorbidities; presenting clinical, laboratory, radiological characteristics on admission and outcomes from the electronic medical records were analyzed comparatively between the younger (<65 years) and older (≥65 years) adults. Factors associated with in-hospital mortality of the older adults were analyzed by multivariate regression analyses. RESULTS: The median age was 56 years (interquartile range [IQR], 46–67), and 224 (61.9%) were male. There were 104 (28.7%) patients ≥65 years of age. More than half of the patients (58%) had one or more chronic comorbidity. The three most common presenting symptoms in the older patients were fatigue/myalgia (89.4%), dry cough (72.1%), and fever (63.5%). Cough and fever were significantly less prevalent in older adults compared to younger patients (p=0.001 and 0.008, respectively). Clinically severe pneumonia was present in 31.5% of the study population being more common in older adults (49% vs. 24.4%) (p<0.001). The laboratory parameters that were significantly different between the older and younger adults were as follows: the older patients had significantly higher CRP, D-dimer, TnT, pro-BNP, procalcitonin levels, higher prevalence of lymphopenia, neutrophilia, increased creatinine, and lower hemoglobin, ALT, albumin level (p<0.05). In the radiological evaluation, more than half of the patients (54.6%) had moderate-severe pneumonia, which was more prevalent in older patients (66% vs. 50%) (p=0.006). The adverse outcomes were significantly more prevalent in older adults compared to the younger patients (ICU admission, 28.8% vs. 8.9%; mortality, 23.1% vs. 4.3%, p<0.001). Among the triage evaluation parameters, the only factor associated with higher mortality was the presence of clinically severe pneumonia on admission (Odds Ratio=12.3, 95% confidence interval=2.7–55.5, p=0.001). CONCLUSION: Older patients presented with more prevalent chronic comorbidities, less prevalent symptomatology but more severe respiratory signs and laboratory abnormalities than the younger patients. Among the triage assessment factors, the clinical evaluation of pulmonary involvement came in front to help clinicians to stratify the patients for mortality risk.","Medetalibeyoglu, A.; Senkal, N.; Kose, M.; Catma, Y.; Caparali, E.

This has resulted in various difficult experiences which includes financial loss, separation from loved ones, grief, uncertainty over disease status and loss of freedom. During these stressful situations, interpersonal violence is likely to be aggravated. To avoid the occurrence of adverse events such as impulsive acts, homicide, or suicide, it is important to identify high-risk individuals. METHODS: This is a descriptive cross-sectional, questionnaire-based, online survey by convenience sampling. The prevalence of different types of interpersonal violence with socio-demographic factors, substance use, and overall mental wellbeing was assessed by using descriptive statistical tests. RESULTS: Out of total 556 participants included in the analysis, 50.9% (283) were male and 48.7% (271) were female. There were 100 (18.0%) participants who reported being a victim of interpersonal violence and 101 (18.2%) participants who reported being a perpetrator during the lockdown. The victims of violence were more likely to be living with their spouse alone. The victims and perpetrators were also more likely to have increased alcohol and tobacco use. More number of victims and perpetrators had lower mental wellbeing scores on the WHO wellbeing index. CONCLUSIONS: There was prevalence of interpersonal violence during the COVID-19 lockdown. In addition to the fear regarding pandemic, victims have to face domestic violence placing them at a double injustice. Identification of vulnerable groups and proper management of survivors must be prioritized given the unanimous consensus on the rise of interpersonal violence during periods of heightened stress.","Ghimire, Calvin; Acharya, Sajan; Shrestha, Carmina; KC, Prabhat; Singh, Swarndeep; Sharma, Pawan",JNMA J Nepal Med Assoc,207,28

Our objective is to describe the clinical presentations and outcomes of COVID-19 infection early in the pandemic at our institution. METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of children up to 18 years who underwent testing for SARS CoV-2 from March 1(st) to May 10(th) 2020 at our pediatric emergency department. We abstracted patient’s demographics, clinical presentation, diagnostic studies and patient disposition. We classified the severity of clinical illness based on published criteria. We excluded patients diagnosed with Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19. RESULTS: SARS CoV-2 testing was performed on 481 patients of whom 43 (8.9%) tested positive. Of these, 4 were diagnosed with MIS-C. Data of 39 patients were analyzed. Patients’ demographics, co-morbidities, presenting signs and symptoms and disposition are shown in Table 1. Age range was 47 days – 18 years. Infants representing one third (14/39; 35.9%) of our study cohort. There was equal sex distribution. Asthma or obesity was present in 17 (44%). The most common presenting symptoms included fever, cough, shortness of breath and diarrhea. Chest radiograph showed pneumonia in 12 (30.8%) patients. Two thirds (27/39; 69.2%) were asymptomatic or had mild disease; six patients (15.4%) had severe or critical illness (Figure 1). Nineteen (48%) patients were admitted to the general pediatric service. Eleven (28%) were admitted to the Intensive Care Units (ICU). The characteristics, presenting symptoms and interventions performed in the PICU cohort are shown in Table 2. Half of these patients required mechanical ventilation. There was one death in a 3 month old infant unrelated to SARS CoV-2. Majority of the infants required hospitalization (12/14; 85.7%), including 4 to the PICU (one each for non accidental trauma, ingestion, seizure and pneumonia). Table 1. Patient demographics, signs and symptoms of COVID-19 infection in Children [Image: see text] Table 2: PICU patients: Characteristics, Interventions and pharmacotherapy [Image: see text] Figure 1: Severity of Ill ness in the study cohort [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Majority (17; 43%) of our children with COVID-19 had a mild disease. Eleven (28%) including 4 infants required critical care; 5 required mechanical ventilation. There was no COVID-19 related mortality. Larger studies are needed to further define the spectrum of COVID- 19 and risk factors associated with severe disease in children.

The social policy in India too has followed the dichotomy of organised and unorganised sector by developing a dual system of social security—a comprehensive, portable social security for organised sector employees who usually have regular salaried jobs and a minimalist social security for unorganised sector workers who are the most vulnerable groups—socially as well as economically. Building upon the ILO Social Protection Floor recommendation, the paper argues for reimagining social security as an intervention to make drastic improvements in the living standard of the entire workforce of India. It highlights three weaknesses in the existing social security system—one, they are based on a reductionist package of social insurance and social assistance; two, they lack a threshold push to make a real change in the lives of beneficiaries and three, the prevailing policy environment seeks to keep workers in abominable conditions in the name of expanding employment opportunities. However, both high as well as some low-income countries have shown that social security can be successfully used to uplift the living standard of vast majority of masses. Rather than treating growth and social security as binaries, a developing country like India, the paper argues, needs to make departure from the growth objectives it has hitherto followed and invest massively into people’s lives. To overcome the historic weaknesses of social security programmes in India, the gap between formal and informal sector must be minimised. The paper strongly argues for making Employees Provident Fund (EPF) and Employees State Insurance (ESI)—the two flagship programmes designed for the organised sector—universal social security programmes in India. This would require work at several levels—right from working out technical details, registration of a very unstable workforce, finding resources and bringing similar initiatives by a host of public actors under a common ‘threshold’ framework. The paper also recognises the need for other securities that can be derived from schemes and programmes related to food and nutrition security; work security in rural and urban areas; cash support; and improvement in housing, surrounding settlement and workplace; and call for combining these with universal EPF and ESI, is termed by the authors as ‘threshold security’. For migrants, all social security programmes and schemes must have an inbuilt portability clause. This would require investing into technology platforms, overcoming exclusions created by the requirements of domicile, adhering to the principle of non-discrimination and equal citizenship, recognising the contributions made by migrants in the growth and development of the country, and amending the basic design of some crucial funds for inter-state portability of resources so that they finally reach the workers.","Pushpendra; Singh, Dipak Kumar",Development Challenges of India After Twenty Five Years of Economic Reforms,207,19

In this work, a set of small molecules were identified as Cdc25 modulators by applying a mixed ligand-structure-based approach and taking advantage of the correlation between the chemosensitivity of selected structures and the protein expression pattern of the proposed target. In the first step of the in silico protocol, a set of molecules acting as Cdc25 inhibitors were identified through a new ligand-based protocol and the evaluation of a large database of molecular structures. Subsequently, induced-fit docking (IFD) studies allowed us to further reduce the number of compounds biologically screened. In vitro antiproliferative and enzymatic inhibition assays on the selected compounds led to the identification of new structurally heterogeneous inhibitors of Cdc25 proteins. Among them, J3955, the most active inhibitor, showed concentration-dependent antiproliferative activity against HepG2 cells, with GI(50) in the low micromolar range. When J3955 was tested in cell-cycle perturbation experiments, it caused mitotic failure by G2/M-phase cell-cycle arrest. Finally, Western blotting analysis showed an increment of phosphorylated Cdk1 levels in cells exposed to J3955, indicating its specific influence in cellular pathways involving Cdc25 proteins.","Lauria, Antonino; Martorana, Annamaria; La Monica, Gabriele; Mannino, Salvatore; Mannino, Giuseppe; Peri, Daniele; Gentile, Carla",Int J Mol Sci,207,16

We aim to review its effects on our theatre output and risk of encountering COVID 19 cases. METHOD: Serial record of operations performed locally were reviewed from start of UK COVID19 pandemic lockdown on 23rd March 2020 to 13th July 2020 after it was lifted. A weekly average by month of operations and the percentage of COVID19 cases diagnosed within 30 days of the procedure were noted. RESULTS: 733 operations performed through this period. In March, 33 operations/week performed, 88.4% emergency and 7% diagnosed with COVID19. April, 31 operations /week performed, 95.9% emergency and 10.6% diagnosed with COVID19. May 46 operations /week performed, 94.5% emergency and 3.3% diagnosed with COVID19. June 56 operations /week, 80.9% emergency and less than 0.01% diagnosed with COVID19. By July 80 operations/week, 59.4% emergency and none diagnosed with COVID 19. Since testing capacity increased, only 6 of the 27 operated were diagnosed with COVID19.

After the preliminary tests of data description, unit root analysis and cointegration test, we find that positive and negative components of both the crude oil and petroleum prices move together in the long run. The result suggests evidence of long-run asymmetry in Nigeria. The empirical findings from both the long-run and short-run results show that petroleum prices in Nigeria respond asymmetrically to changes in crude oil prices. Specifically, the outcomes from the study reveal that positive changes (increase) in crude oil prices produce a larger and stronger effect on petroleum prices than the effect of negative changes (decrease) in crude oil prices indicating evidence of an asymmetric relationship between the two prices in Nigeria. Thus, the findings confirm the existence of the rocket and feather hypothesis in the retail energy market in Nigeria. Overall, the study finds convincing evidence to support the hypothesis of “rocket and feather” in the pass-through effect of crude oil prices on petroleum prices in Nigeria. The study advocates for more government intervention in the energy market to reduce the welfare loss associated with an increase in crude oil prices on the citizens.","Olayungbo, D. O.; Ojeyinka, T.

Unlike most LMIC countries, the prevalence of smoking in Mexico is higher among the well-off than among the poor. Yet, tobacco tax rates in Mexico are lower than those in most LMIC countries. There is room, thus, to implement tax reforms and compensating policies to mitigate their impact on the poor. Our analysis is based on the stochastic dominance approach. More precisely, several tax reforms are analyzed through the so-called Consumption Dominance curves. In addition, the reforms are assumed to be revenue neutral and to give rise to compensating subsidies on specific goods. Our results show that if the Mexican government were to implement a WHO-type reform, poverty among households with at least one smoking member would increase by 2.6 % points. Yet, the deleterious effects are entirely mitigated by price subsidies on staple foods.

Fundoscopy revealed diffuse optic disc swelling in the right eye, which was prominent above the optic disc. Goldmann visual field testing identified an inferior altitudinal visual field defect with I/2 isopter in the right eye. Although typical complete inferior visual field defect was not detected, a diagnosis of NA-AION was made. The patient was followed without any treatment. During the 2-month follow-up period, the optic disc swelling was gradually improved, and visual acuity was maintained 20/20; however, the optic disc looked diffusely pale in the right eye. Although it is uncertain whether the development of NA-AION after COVID-19 vaccination was consequential or coincidental, we speculate that the close temporal relationship with COVID-19 vaccination suggests the possibility of vasculopathy on the microvascular network of optic nerve head as background of inflammatory or immune-mediated element to the timing of the onset of NA-AION. The aim of this case report is to present this biological plausibility and to elucidate potential ophthalmological complications.","Tsukii, Rika; Kasuya, Yuka; Makino, Shinji",Case Rep Ophthalmol Med,207,19

DATA SOURCES PubMed, Embase, Scopus, PsycINFO (EBSCO), CINAHL (EBSCO), and CENTRAL (Cochrane Library) electronic databases were searched from inception until October 4, 2018. REVIEW METHODS Articles were reviewed for inclusion by 2 independent reviewers. The references of included articles were hand-searched for additional relevant articles. Data were extracted by 2 independent extractors. RESULTS Of 2092 articles imported from the search, 81 were included for the review. Nearly a third (31%, n = 25) included patients with profound hearing loss. In total, 23 unique tools were used for 105 unique applications. The Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE) was the most commonly used (54%, n = 55), followed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) (19%, n = 10). Nearly half of the tools were used to define patient inclusion or exclusion in a study (48%, n = 50), followed by examination of a change after an intervention (26%, n = 27). Two articles attempted to study the validity of the MMSE and MoCA for screening patients with mild to moderate hearing loss and found mixed effects of the auditory components. There were no validation studies identified from the search. CONCLUSION Many different cognitive screening tools have been used to study patients with postlingual hearing loss. The effects of the auditory components of these tools may be deleterious but ultimately remain unclear from the available evidence. To date, there has been no validation of any cognitive screening tool to be used for adults with postlingual hearing loss.","Raymond, Mallory; Barrett, Devon; Lee, Daniel Juno; Peterson, Shenita; Raol, Nikhila; Vivas, Esther X",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,207,28

However, circulatory stability may be compromised by the obstruction of venous return. The aim was to explore which combinations of arterial and venous endovascular balloon occlusions, and the Pringle maneuver, are hemodynamically possible in a normovolemic pig model. The hypothesis was that lower body venous blood pooling from REBOVC can be avoided by prior resuscitative endovascular aortic balloon occlusion (REBOA). METHODS Nine anesthetized, ventilated, instrumented and normovolemic pigs were used to explore the hemodynamic effects of eleven combinations of REBOA and REBOVC, with or without the Pringle maneuver, in randomized order. The occlusions were performed for 5 minutes but interrupted if systolic blood pressure dropped below 40 mmHg. Hemodynamic variables were measured. RESULTS Proximal REBOVC, isolated or in combination with other methods of occlusion, caused severely decreased systemic blood pressure and cardiac output, and had to be terminated before 5 min. The decreases in systemic blood pressure and cardiac output were avoided by REBOA at the same or a more proximal level. The Pringle maneuver had similar hemodynamic effects to proximal REBOVC. CONCLUSIONS A combination of REBOA and REBOVC provides hemodynamic stability, in contrast to REBOVC alone or with the Pringle maneuver, and may be a possible adjunct in severe retrohepatic venous bleedings.Level of evidenceBasic science study, therapeutic.","Wikström, Maria B; Krantz, Johannes; Hörer, Tal M; Nilsson, Kristofer F",The journal of trauma and acute care surgery,207,31

There are few studies on the contamination pathway of PAEs from labels or tapes to food stuff. In this study, the concentrations of eleven PAEs in adhesive labels, tapes, labeled fruits and vegetables on the market were investigated. The eleven PAEs were detected with the total concentration of 7.44-30.51 mg/m2 in labels and tapes. Diethyl phthalate (DEP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DIBP), dimethyl phthalate (DMP), Bis (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) had the highest detection frequency in adhesive material samples. The concentrations of PAEs in labeled fruits were higher than that in unlabeled fruits, especially in the peel, indicating PAEs could transfer from labels or tapes to fruits and vegetables. Furthermore, the migration behaviors of PAEs from labels or tapes to apples, avocados and celery were investigated. It was found that the PAEs could penetrate to apple and avocado pulp through the peel, resulting in the residue of the PAEs in the whole fruit. Unlike apple peel, the thick avocado peel was more difficultly penetrated by the PAEs. Due to the high lipid content, the PAEs distributed more evenly in avocado pulp than in apple pulp. The migrations up to a maximum of 4.16 mg/kg were found for butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP) in avocado peel and up to a maximum of 0.188 mg/kg in avocado pulp. The average migration of the PAEs in celery ranged from 0.3 to 26.1 μg/kg in three days and the low migration might result from the rough surface and less contacting area. These findings suggest that the use of labels or tapes in direct contact may increase the risk of PAEs exposure to humans through fruits and vegetables.","Hou, Haonan; Min, Yihao; Liu, Xueke; Wang, Peng; Zhou, Zhiqiang; Liu, Donghui",Journal of hazardous materials,207,16

Here, we characterized and quantified SARS-CoV-2 specific immune responses in patients with different clinical courses.

Strikingly, however, in these patients the specific IgG antibody response was remarkably strong. Furthermore, in these critically ill patients, a massive influx of circulating T cells into the lungs was observed, overwhelming the local T cell compartment, and indicative of vascular leakage.

METHOD The patient was a 28-year-old female with a BMI of 48.75 with no prior surgery but with numerous comorbidities. With the patient placed in a split-leg position and in steep reverse Trendelenburg, a 12-mm optical trocar is placed 12 cm distal to the xiphoid process in the left paramedian location. A Nathanson liver retractor is placed through a midepigastric 5-mm incision. Two 5-mm low-profile trocars are placed next to the 12-mm trocar through separate incisions (this maintains stability of each cannula) and a 5-mm 45 ° laparoscope is used. Using an automated suturing device, a stay suture is placed high on the fundus and externalized for retraction. An articulating band passer dissects the phrenogastric attachments at the angle of His. The 12-mm port is removed and the gastric band is inserted. The GE junction fat pad is excised and the Pars Flaccida membrane is divided using conventional instruments. A second traction suture is placed to retract the lesser curve fat and right crus fat pad. A peritoneal bite is also taken in the left lateral subcostal area such that when this suture is externalized, it acts as a pulley. An articulating 5-mm grasper is used to develop the retrogastric tunnel. Then the band is fed into position and its buckle is locked. Three interrupted sutures are placed to create an anterior gastric plication and a fourth antislippage suture is placed below the band along the lesser curve. The band tubing is externalized and the port is implanted by joining the three working trocar incisions into a single 4.5-cm incision. RESULTS The patient did well postoperatively with no complications. CONCLUSIONS A modified single incision approach for laparoscopic gastric band placement is feasible and provides patients with improved cosmesis.","Scott, Daniel J; Castellvi, Antonio O; Varela, J Esteban; Rivas, Homero",Surgical endoscopy,207,1

DESIGN This was a prospective, randomized trial of a convenience sample of patients. This study was approved by the institutional review board and Food and Drug Administration as a physician-sponsored trial (FDA investigational new drug no. 68762). SETTING The study was conducted in a large urban, academic emergency department. PATIENTS Patients aged 18 to 100 with simple, uncomplicated lacerations requiring repair that were less than 8 hours old were enrolled. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized to receive either NS or CD wound irrigation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Demographics, infection, and cosmesis were analyzed and assessed. Cosmetic outcome was assessed at 3 to 4 months using a visual analog scale (VAS), wound evaluation score (WES), patient VAS (VASPt), and digital imaging VAS by 2 plastic surgeons (VASPlast). MAIN RESULTS One hundred ninety-three patients were enrolled. Data analysis was available for 175 cases (86 NS and 89 CD). Wound infection follow-up was obtained in 74.9% of the patients. The 3- to 4-month cosmesis follow-up was 37.7% for VAS/WES, 40.0% for VASPt, and 37.7% for VASPlast. There were no significant differences in demographics, key wound characteristics, infection, adverse reactions, and cosmesis. CONCLUSION The authors report the use of a novel antimicrobial irrigation solution. Chlorine dioxide appears to be a safe biologically acceptable antiseptic wound irrigant that does not appear to interfere with cosmetic outcomes.","Valente, Jonathan H; Jay, Gregory D; Zabbo, Christopher P; Reinert, Steven E; Bertsch, Karina",Advances in skin & wound care,207,28

METHODS On-demand telehealth requests made to a large healthcare system in the USA between 15 March 2020 and 31 May 2020 were included for analysis with a focus on patients who were defined as left without being seen (LWBS). As part of a pilot program a registered nurse attempted to call LWBS patients within 24 hours of their telehealth request and asked if they were ok, if they sought care for their original visit reason, what that care was, or if they still needed guidance. This information and patient demographics were analyzed. RESULTS During the study period there were 21,610 completed on-demand telehealth visits and 1852 patients for whom there were LWBS attempted follow-ups. Most patients LWBS for a reason that originated from the patient and not associated with the provider or telehealth platform. The mean wait time for LWBS patients was 12.4 min compared to patients waiting 15.1 min before engaging with a provider to complete a visit. Of the 1852 total LWBS patients in the follow-up programme, 819 (44.2%) were successfully contacted with a follow-up phone call. Most of these patients (63.2%) already completed or planned to complete a telehealth visit, 13.6% indicated they no longer needed to see a provider, and 12.8% planned or already completed an in-person visit. Only 2.2% went to an emergency department.

Stents placed across the transverse and sigmoid sinuses often cover the vein of Labbé (VOL), a major anastomotic vein draining the cerebral hemisphere. The patency of the VOL after stenting and its clinical implications are poorly understood. METHODS A retrospective analysis was performed of a prospectively collected database of patients undergoing venous sinus stenting. Pre- and post-stent angiography were compared to assess changes in VOL patency, clinical and radiographic outcomes. RESULTS The study cohort comprised 56 patients. The stent covered the VOL in 92.9% of cases. Thirty-two cases with VOL coverage had evaluable angiograms immediately after stent placement. Among these, VOL filled normally in 75.0%, exhibited diminished caliber with normal transit time in 3.1%, filled sluggishly in 18.8%, and was occluded in 3.1%. Follow-up was assessed in patients with at least 3 months' angiographic follow-up (46 patients, mean 7.2 months). Of these, normal filling was seen in 71.7%, diminished caliber in 26.1%, and sluggish filling in 2.2% of cases. Neither stent coverage of the VOL nor its patency immediately after stenting or at follow-up correlated with stent-adjacent stenosis. There were no neurological sequelae from coverage of the VOL or alteration of its drainage pattern. CONCLUSIONS In the majority of venous stenting cases involving the transverse and sigmoid sinuses, the VOL remains widely patent. Complete VOL occlusion rarely occurs after stenting and may not result in clinical sequelae. Stent coverage of the VOL should not deter the therapeutic use of venous sinus stenting.","Raper, Daniel M S; Ding, Dale; Chen, Ching-Jen; Buell, Thomas J; Crowley, R Webster; Liu, Kenneth C",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,207,19

Yet, results from studies describing associations between chaos and childhood obesity are mixed. New approaches to studying the environments of young children may help to clarify chaos-obesity relationships. METHODS We conducted a concurrent mixed methods analysis of quantitative and qualitative data describing home and neighborhood chaos among a diverse cohort of 283 caregiver-toddlers dyads from Ohio. We examined the underlying structure of environmental and household chaos using exploratory factor analysis then sought to validate the structure using qualitative field notes. We generated total scores for factors of chaos and described their distributions overall and according to cohort characteristics. Additionally, we conducted a thematic content analysis of brief ethnographies to provide preliminary construct validity for our indicators of chaos. RESULTS Dyads varied according to household composition, income, education, and race/ethnicity. We found evidence for a multi-factor structure for chaos, which included disorganization and neighborhood noise. Household disorganization scores ranged from 0 to 7.3 and were on average 2.1 (SD = 1.8). Neighborhood noise scores ranged from 0 to 4 and were on average 1.1 (SD = 1.1). Both disorganization and neighborhood noise were associated with indicators of socioeconomic disadvantage, such as lower educational attainment and household income. Qualitative data from households with high and low scores on the two identified factors were aligned in ways that were supportive of construct validity and further contextualized the social and material environments in which chaos occurred. CONCLUSIONS Chaos represents a complex construct with implications spanning various disciplines, including childhood obesity research. Previous studies suggest challenges associated with measuring chaos may limit the conclusions that can be drawn about which aspect of chaos (if any) matter most of early childhood weight development. We advance the literature by demonstrating chaos may be comprised of conceptually distinct subdomains. Future childhood obesity prevention research may benefit from more contemporary measure of chaos, such as those relying on direct observations that account for a multifaceted underlying structure.","Krupsky, Kathryn L; Parrott, Andria; Andridge, Rebecca; Zvara, Bharathi J; Keim, Sarah A; Anderson, Sarah E",BMC public health,207,29

This study aimed to analyze the impact of CVP drop after HP on intraoperative blood loss and postoperative renal function. METHODS A retrospective review of a prospective database including 100 consecutive patients (43 males and 57 females; mean age, 65 years; range 23-89 years) undergoing liver resection with HP was performed. The primary outcome variable was estimated blood loss (EBL), and the secondary outcome was postoperative serum creatinin (Scr). A multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of intraoperative blood loss. RESULTS The median CVP before blood salvage was 8 mmHg (range 4-30 mmHg). The median volume of hypovolemic phlebotomy was 400 ml (range 200-1000 ml). After HP, CVP decreased to a median of 3 mmHg (range -2 to 16 mmHg), resulting in a median CVP drop of 5.5 mmHg (range 2-14 mmHg). The median EBL during liver resection was 165 ml (range 0-800 ml). The median preoperative serum creatinin (Scr) was 0.82 g/dl (range 0.5-1.74 g/dl), and the postoperative Scr on day 1 was 0.74 g/dl (range 0.44-1.68 g/dl). The CVP drop was associated with EBL (P < 0.001). There was no significant impact of CVP drop on postoperative Scr. CONCLUSION A CVP drop after HP is a strong independent predictor of EBL during liver resection. The authors advocate the routine use of HP to reduce perioperative blood loss and transfusion rates in liver surgery. As a predictive tool, CVP drop might help surgeons decide whether a laparoscopic approach is safe.","Ryckx, Andries; Christiaens, Claudine; Clarysse, Mathias; Vansteenkiste, Franky; Steelant, Pieter Jan; Sergeant, Gregory; Parmentier, Isabelle; Pottel, Hans; D'Hondt, Mathieu",Annals of surgical oncology,207,1

METHODS Sputum or nasal wash specimens obtained from 490 previously healthy children < or =2 years of age hospitalized with AB between December 1, 2005 and March 31, 2006 were tested: (1) For RSV, by rapid antigen detection test; (2) For RSV, influenza A, B, Parainfluenza 1 to 3, and adenovirus antigens by direct fluorescent assay; (3) For influenza A and B, RSV, Parainfluenza 1 to 3 viruses RNA by reverse transcription (RT) PCR assay; (4) For human metapneumovirus and rhinovirus RNA by RT real-time PCR assay; (5) For adenovirus, and Bordetella pertussis DNA by conventional PCR assays; (6) For human bocavirus DNA by real-tine PCR assays. RESULTS At least 1 organism was detected in 465 (91%) children. In 283 (61%), 117 (25%), and 23 (5%) children, 1, 2, and 3/4 organisms were detected, respectively. The most commonly detected organism was RSV, detected in 76%, and as a sole organism in 49%. Rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza virus A, bocavirus, Bordetella pertussis, and adenovirus were detected as a sole organism in 7%, 2.1%, 1%, 0.6%, 0.6%, and 0.2% of the children, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Respiratory organisms were detected in the majority of the children, of whom about one third suffered from mixed organism infection. RSV was the most prevalent sole detected organism. The relevance of all other organisms may be much less than previously suggested.","Miron, Dan; Srugo, Isaac; Kra-Oz, Zipi; Keness, Yoram; Wolf, Dana; Amirav, Israel; Kassis, Imad",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,207,28

To ensure continuity of cancer genetic counseling at a large academic medical center while also promoting the safety of patients and staff, our team transitioned to fully remote telephone genetic counseling and testing services within 48 hr. We compare differences in the six weeks following the shift to telephone genetic counseling (post-COVID) to the six weeks preceding the pandemic (pre-COVID). We maintained 99% of our total visit capacity and saw a decrease in patient no-show rate from 9.5% to 7.3%. Of all patients who received telephone genetic counseling, fewer consented to genetic testing as compared to patients seen in-person prior to the pandemic (79% pre-COVID v. 72% post-COVID; p = .012). Four weeks after this cohort was closed for analysis, 96 out of 303 samples (32%) had not been received by the genetic testing laboratory, despite at least one reminder phone call to the patient. In 13 reported instances, a second sample was required (quality not sufficient, lost or mislabeled sample), thus delaying test results. We conclude that a rapid transition to remote genetic counseling and testing allowed uninterrupted access to cancer genetics services during to the COVID-19 pandemic. Patient compliance with sample return and higher rates of sample failure emerge as potential barriers to timely genetic testing under this service delivery model.","Shannon, Kristen M; Emmet, Margaret M; Rodgers, Linda H; Wooters, Mackenzie; Seidel, Meredith L",Journal of genetic counseling,207,1

The asymptomatic coexistence with viruses is thought to be connected to the unique immune system of bats. MHC class I (MHC I) presentation is closely related to cytotoxic lymphocyte immunity, which plays an important role in viral resistance. To investigate the characteristics of MHC I presentation in bats, the crystal structures of peptide-MHC I complexes of Pteropus alecto, Ptal-N*01:01/HEV-1 (DFANTFLP) and Ptal-N*01:01/HEV-2 (DYINTNLVP), and two related mutants, Ptal-N*01:01/HEV-1PΩL (DFANTFLL) and Ptal-N*01:01ΔMDL/HEV-1, were determined. Through structural analysis, we found that Ptal-N*01:01 had a multi-Ala-assembled pocket B and a flexible hydrophobic pocket F, which could accommodate variable anchor residues and allow Ptal-N*01:01 to bind numerous peptides. Three sequential amino acids, Met, Asp, and Leu, absent from the α1 domain of the H chain in other mammals, were present in this domain in the bat. Upon deleting these amino acids and determining the structure in p/Ptal-N*01:01ΔMDL/HEV-1, we found they helped form an extra salt-bridge chain between the H chain and the N-terminal aspartic acid of the peptide. By introducing an MHC I random peptide library for de novo liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis, we found that this insertion module, present in all types of bats, can promote MHC I presentation of peptides with high affinity during the peptide exchange process. This study will help us better understand how bat MHC I presents high-affinity peptides from an extensive binding peptidome and provides a foundation to understand the cellular immunity of bats.","Qu, Zehui; Li, Zibin; Ma, Lizhen; Wei, Xiaohui; Zhang, Lijie; Liang, Ruiying; Meng, Geng; Zhang, Nianzhi; Xia, Chun",Journal of immunology,207,27

Implementing case management functions can support delivery of PPC and help patients and their families navigate health, social and fiscal environments that become more complex at end-of-life. A realist synthesis was conducted to understand how multi-level contexts affect case management functions related to initiating end-of-life conversations, assessing patient and caregiver needs, and patient/family centred planning in primary care practices to improve outcomes. The synthesis also explored how these functions aligned with critical community resources identified by patients/families dealing with end-of-life. METHODS A realist synthesis is theory driven and iterative, involving the investigation of proposed program theories of how particular contexts catalyze mechanisms (program resources and individual reactions to resources) to generate improved outcomes. To assess whether program theories were supported and plausible, two librarian-assisted and several researcher-initiated purposive searches of the literature were conducted, then extracted data were analyzed and synthesized. To assess relevancy, health system partners and family advisors informed the review process. RESULTS Twenty-eight articles were identified as being relevant and evidence was consolidated into two final program theories: 1) Making end-of-life discussions comfortable, and 2) Creating plans that reflect needs and values. Theories were explored in depth to assess the effect of multi-level contexts on primary care practices implementing tools or frameworks, strategies for improving end-of-life communications, or facilitators that could improve advance care planning by primary care practitioners. CONCLUSIONS Primary care practitioners' use of tools to assess patients/families' needs facilitated discussions and planning for end-of-life issues without specifically discussing death. Also, receiving training on how to better communicate increased practitioner confidence for initiating end-of-life discussions. Practitioner attitudes toward death and prior education or training in end-of-life care affected their ability to initiate end-of-life conversations and plan with patients/families. Recognizing and seizing opportunities when patients are aware of the need to plan for their end-of-life care, such as in contexts when patients experience transitions can increase readiness for end-of-life discussions and planning. Ultimately conversations and planning can improve patients/families' outcomes.","Warner, Grace; Baird, Lisa Garland; McCormack, Brendan; Urquhart, Robin; Lawson, Beverley; Tschupruk, Cheryl; Christian, Erin; Weeks, Lori; Kumanan, Kothai; Sampalli, Tara",BMC palliative care,207,26

Whether donor or recipient sex and sex-hormone levels impact alloimmune responses remains unclear. In uni- and multifactorial analyses of more than 400.000 SRTR listed kidney transplant patients, we found that younger female recipients had an inferior death-censored graft survival that was independent of donor sex. In contrast, graft survival was superior in older female recipients, suggesting the impact of recipient sex-hormones over chromosomal sex mismatches. Those clinical changes were delineated in experimental skin and heart transplant models showing a prolongation of graft survival in ovariectomized young female recipients. In contrast, graft survival was comparable in ovariectomized and naïve old female recipients. Young ovariectomized mice showed reduced amounts and a compromised T cell proliferation. Deprivation of female hormones dampened the production of IFN-ɣ and IL-17+ by CD4+ T cells while augmenting systemic counts of T regs. Increasing estradiol concentrations in-vitro promoted the switch of naïve CD4+ T-cells into Th1 cells; high physiological estradiol concentrations dampening Th1 responses, promoted T regs, and prolonged graft survival. Thus, clinical observations demonstrate age-specific graft survival patterns in female recipients. Estrogen levels, in turn, impact the fate of T-cell subsets, providing relevant and novel information on age and sex-specific alloimmunity.","Maenosono, Ryoichi; Nian, Yeqi; Iske, Jasper; Liu, Yang; Minami, Koichiro; Rommel, Tabea; Martin, Friederike; Abdi, Reza; Azuma, Haruhito; Rosner, Bernhard A; Zhou, Hao; Milford, Edgar; Elkhal, Abdallah; Tullius, Stefan G",American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,207,1

Here, we report a stepwise protocol for an RNA-extraction-free nano-amplified colorimetric test for rapid and naked-eye molecular diagnosis of COVID-19. The test employs a unique dual-prong approach that integrates nucleic acid (NA) amplification and plasmonic sensing for point-of-care detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with a sample-to-assay response time of <1 h. The RNA-extraction-free nano-amplified colorimetric test utilizes plasmonic gold nanoparticles capped with antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) as a colorimetric reporter to detect the amplified nucleic acid from the COVID-19 causative virus, SARS-CoV-2. The ASOs are specific for the SARS-CoV-2 N-gene, and binding of the ASOs to their target sequence results in the aggregation of the plasmonic gold nanoparticles. This highly specific agglomeration step leads to a change in the plasmonic response of the nanoparticles. Furthermore, when tested using clinical samples, the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the test were found to be >98.4%, >96.6% and 100%, respectively, with a detection limit of 10 copies/μL. The test can easily be adapted to diagnose other viral infections with a simple modification of the ASOs and primer sequences. It also provides a low-cost, rapid approach requiring minimal instrumentation that can be used as a screening tool for the diagnosis of COVID-19 at point-of-care settings in resource-poor situations. The colorimetric readout of the test can even be monitored using a handheld optical reader to obtain a quantitative response. Therefore, we anticipate that this protocol will be widely useful for the development of biosensors for the molecular diagnostics of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases.","Alafeef, Maha; Moitra, Parikshit; Dighe, Ketan; Pan, Dipanjan",Nature protocols,207,11

In recent years, key improvements to the vaccinia virus leading to a safer version (Modified Vaccinia Ankara, MVA) and the discovery that some viruses can be used as carriers of heterologous genes encoding for pathological antigens of other infectious agents (the concept of 'viral vectors') has spurred a new wave of clinical research potentially providing for a solution for the long sought after vaccines against major diseases such as HIV, TB, RSV and Malaria, or emerging infectious diseases including those caused by filoviruses and coronaviruses. The unique ability of some of these viral vectors to stimulate the cellular arm of the immune response and, most importantly, T lymphocytes with cell killing activity, has also reawakened the interest toward developing therapeutic vaccines against chronic infectious diseases and cancer. To this end, existing vectors such as those based on Adenoviruses have been improved in immunogenicity and efficacy. Along the same line, new vectors that exploit viruses such as Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV), Measles Virus (MV), Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV), have emerged. Furthermore, technological progress toward modifying their genome to render some of these vectors incompetent for replication has increased confidence toward their use in infant and elderly populations. Lastly, their production process being the same for every product has made viral vectored vaccines the technology of choice for rapid development of vaccines against emerging diseases and for 'personalised' cancer vaccines where there is an absolute need to reduce time to the patient from months to weeks or days. Here we review the recent developments in viral vector technologies, focusing on novel vectors based on primate derived Adenoviruses and Poxviruses, Rhabdoviruses, Paramixoviruses, Arenaviruses and Herpesviruses. We describe the rationale for, immunologic mechanisms involved in, and design of viral vectored gene vaccines under development and discuss the potential utility of these novel genetic vaccine approaches in eliciting protection against infectious diseases and cancer.","Sasso, Emanuele; D'Alise, Anna Morena; Zambrano, Nicola; Scarselli, Elisa; Folgori, Antonella; Nicosia, Alfredo",Seminars in immunology,207,16

Several authors reported significantly better early outcomes when compared to the posterior approach (PA). Nevertheless, controversy exists regarding longer-term benefits of the DAA. METHODS Data was prospectively collected and retrospectively reviewed for primary THAs conducted between July 2008 and July 2016. Patients who underwent DAA and PA with minimum 2-year follow-up for Harris Hip Score (HHS), Forgotten Joint Score-12 (FJS-12), Veteran RAND 12 Mental (VR-12 Mental), Veteran RAND 12 Physical (VR-12 Physical), 12-Item Short Form Survey Mental (SF-12 Mental), 12-Item Short Form Survey Physical (SF-12 Physical), visual analogue scale, and patient satisfaction were included. Propensity score matching was performed on the DAA and PA cohorts (1:1) based on the following variables: age, sex, body mass index, and laterality. RESULTS 205 DAA hips were satisfactorily matched to 205 PA hips.

Because of the risk of distal wire perforation associated with exchange maneuvers, we sought to find an alternative technique. METHODS Our experience shows that a microcatheter tends to preferentially follow a previously placed microcatheter, even if the initial catheterization might be challenging. Accessing an artery with two microcatheters simultaneously may thus be an alternative to an exchange maneuver. Because of this tendency for catheters to behave like sheep following one another, we named this method the sheeping technique (ST). The ST consists of (a) first placing a 1.7 French microcatheter into the division branch requiring balloon or stent protection to straighten the course of the arteries in order to facilitate and (b) positioning in the same artery of a larger and stiffer balloon or stent microcatheter. Once the second balloon or stent microcatheter is in place, the first microcatheter can be pulled back and used to coil the aneurysm. RESULTS Between January 2009 and December 2012, The ST was successfully used in 208/246 procedures (85%). Conversion to an exchange maneuver was necessary in 38/246 (15%). There were no arterial perforations or ischemic events related to the handling of both microcatheters. CONCLUSION The sheeping technique may improve safety by replacing the need for an exchange maneuver during difficult balloon- or stent-assisted coiling.","Chapot, René; Nordmeyer, Hannes; Heddier, Markus; Velasco, Aglaé; Schooss, Petra; Stauder, Michael; Stracke, Paul; Mosimann, Pascal J",Neuroradiology,207,1

This study aimed to investigate the effect of brief hyperoxic exposures on regional cerebral tissue oxygen saturation (rStO2 ) and to evaluate whether any observed prolonged cerebral vasoconstriction was related to maturity. METHODS The study included 30 infants with a postmenstrual age of more than 32 weeks, who were treated with nasal continuous positive airway pressure and a fraction of inspired oxygen of ≤0.3. The INVOS 5100C oximeter was used to measure rStO2 before, during and after two hyperoxic exposures. If hyperoxia induced a prolonged cerebral vasoconstriction, posthyperoxic rStO2 would be expected to decrease. RESULTS rStO2 increased slightly after the first hyperoxic exposure, with a mean difference of 1.37% (95% CI 0.15, 2.6). After the second oxygen exposure, rStO2 remained unchanged with a mean difference of -0.4% (95% CI -1.6, 0.78). Differences in rStO2 were not related to gestational age in either of the two hyperoxic episodes.

CONCLUSION Disaster policies and procedures are needed that will alleviate leadership angst, maximize nursing resources, heighten trust, and enhance communications. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT In 2020, we witnessed a previously inconceivable media and public focus on the value of nursing care. Leaders can use this pivotal moment in time as a catalyst toward securing the support needed in planning for the next pandemic.","Freysteinson, Wyona M; Celia, Tania; Gilroy, Heidi; Gonzalez, Kimberly",Journal of nursing management,207,6

NF2 is characterized by bilateral vestibular schwannomas (VSs) that cause progressive and debilitating hearing loss, leading to social isolation and increased rates of depression. A major limitation in NF2 basic and translational research is the lack of animal models that allow the full spectrum of research into the biology and molecular mechanisms of NF2 tumor progression, as well as the effects on neurological function. In this protocol, we describe how to inject schwannoma cells into the mouse brain cerebellopontine angle (CPA) region. We also describe how to apply state-of-the-art intravital imaging and hearing assessment techniques to study tumor growth and hearing loss. In addition, ataxia, angiogenesis, and tumor-stroma interaction assays can be applied, and the model can be used to test the efficacy of novel therapeutic approaches. By studying the disease from every angle, this model offers the potential to unravel the basic biological underpinnings of NF2 and to develop novel therapeutics to control this devastating disease. Our protocol can be adapted to study other diseases within the CPA, including meningiomas, lipomas, vascular malformations, hemangiomas, epidermoid cysts, cerebellar astrocytomas, and metastatic lesions.

However, after detachment of the line of fusion of the pericardium to the diaphragm (LFPD), the intrathoracic IVC can be exposed easily. We herein present this novel surgical method, an approach to the intrathoracic IVC through the abdominal cavity. A 66 year-old man was referred to our hospital because of high-grade fever. Computed tomography revealed a large tumor of the left hepatic lobe with tumor thrombus extending into the intrathoracic IVC through the left hepatic vein. Laboratory data showed elevated levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) (726 ng/ml) and protein induced by vitamin K absence (114 AU/ml). The patient was diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) of the left hepatic lobe with tumor thrombus extending into the IVC. He underwent left hepatectomy with partial resection of the IVC and intravascular tumor thrombectomy under total hepatic vascular exclusion (THVE) without the use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Before THVE, we approached the IVC through the abdominal cavity with vertical dissection of the diaphragm after detachment of the LFPD without cutting the pericardium or performing median sternotomy.

Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems operate at high-strength magnetic fields (1.5-3 T) that require strict, access-controlled environments. Limited access to timely neuroimaging remains a key structural barrier to effectively monitor the occurrence and progression of neurological injury in intensive care settings. Recent advances in low-field MRI technology have allowed for the acquisition of clinically meaningful imaging outside of radiology suites and in the presence of ferromagnetic materials at the bedside. Objective To perform an assessment of brain injury in critically ill patients in intensive care unit settings, using a portable, low-field MRI device at the bedside. Design, Setting, and Participants This was a prospective, single-center cohort study of 50 patients admitted to the neuroscience or coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) intensive care units at Yale New Haven Hospital in New Haven, Connecticut, from October 30, 2019, to May 20, 2020. Patients were eligible if they presented with neurological injury or alteration, no contraindications for conventional MRI, and a body habitus not exceeding the scanner's 30-cm vertical opening. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was determined by positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 polymerase chain reaction nasopharyngeal swab result. Exposures Portable MRI in an intensive care unit room. Main Outcomes and Measures Demographic, clinical, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Brain imaging findings are described. Results Point-of-care MRI examinations were performed on 50 patients (16 women [32%]; mean [SD] age, 59 [12] years [range, 20-89 years]). Patients presented with ischemic stroke (n = 9), hemorrhagic stroke (n = 12), subarachnoid hemorrhage (n = 2), traumatic brain injury (n = 3), brain tumor (n = 4), and COVID-19 with altered mental status (n = 20). Examinations were acquired at a median of 5 (range, 0-37) days after intensive care unit admission. Diagnostic-grade T1-weighted, T2-weighted, T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, and diffusion-weighted imaging sequences were obtained for 37, 48, 45, and 32 patients, respectively. Neuroimaging findings were detected in 29 of 30 patients who did not have COVID-19 (97%), and 8 of 20 patients with COVID-19 (40%) demonstrated abnormalities. There were no adverse events or complications during deployment of the portable MRI or scanning in an intensive care unit room. Conclusions and Relevance This single-center series of patients with critical illness in an intensive care setting demonstrated the feasibility of low-field, portable MRI. These findings demonstrate the potential role of portable MRI to obtain neuroimaging in complex clinical care settings.","Sheth, Kevin N; Mazurek, Mercy H; Yuen, Matthew M; Cahn, Bradley A; Shah, Jill T; Ward, Adrienne; Kim, Jennifer A; Gilmore, Emily J; Falcone, Guido J; Petersen, Nils; Gobeske, Kevin T; Kaddouh, Firas; Hwang, David Y; Schindler, Joseph; Sansing, Lauren; Matouk, Charles; Rothberg, Jonathan; Sze, Gordon; Siner, Jonathan; Rosen, Matthew S; Spudich, Serena; Kimberly, W Taylor",JAMA neurology,207,24

Intensified chemotherapy regimens have increased the probability of converting unresectable metastasis to resectable. Here, we report the result of combining intensive chemotherapy (triplet) and surgical resection of metastatic lesions in patients with metastatic CRC. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with unresectable metastatic CRC were enrolled in phase I/II trial of triplet chemotherapy consisting of capecitabine, oxaliplatin, irinotecan, and bevacizumab. Patients were given 5-8 cycles induction chemotherapy of the above regimen followed by maintenance capecitabine and bevacizumab until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient request. All patients were assessed at a multidisciplinary conference for possible surgical resection of their metastatic disease at the time of inclusion in the trial and 2 monthly intervals thereafter. Patients who underwent R0 resection of their metastatic disease received adjuvant oxaliplatin and capecitabine to complete a total of 6 months of chemotherapy. RESULTS Fifty-three patients were enrolled. The median age was 52 years (range 23-74), 29 (55%) were males, ECOG PS 0-1 was 13 (66%), 11 (42%) had a right-sided tumor, 29 (55%) had resection of their primary tumor, 22 (42%) had a single metastatic site, and 8 (15.1%) had a liver-limited disease. Thirteen patients (24.5%) underwent surgical resection of residual metastatic disease +/- the primary tumor with 10 (18.9%) of them were R0. The surgical group had a higher incidence of males compared to the non-surgical group (69.3% vs 47.2%, p = 0.2), equal performance status, lower median number of metastatic sites (1 vs 2, p = 0.09), higher mutant Kras (53.8% vs 34.2%, p = 0.3), and higher response rate (84.6% vs 56.2%, p = 0.3). With a median follow-up duration of 89 months, the median PFS for the whole group was 16.1 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 9.1-20] and the median OS was 28.2 months (95% CI 22.5-53.3). The median PFS for the surgery group was 18.9 months (95% CI 12.6-not reached) compared to 9.6 months (95% CI 7.0-18.3) for the non-surgical group, log-rank p = 0.0165. The median OS for both groups was not reached (95% CI 53.3-not reached) and 23.2 months (95% CI 17.0-28.4) respectively, log-rank p = 0.0006. Five-year PFS and OS for the surgery group were 46.2% and 67.6% respectively. CONCLUSIONS Patients with unresectable metastatic CRC and fit for triplet chemotherapy should have the benefit of combining this intensified regimen and surgical resection of their metastatic disease if possible.

However, it has been challenged in some corners of bioethics based on concerns about various harms-to participants, to scientific integrity, and to research bystanders-that may stem from withdrawal. These concerns have become particularly salient in emerging debates about the ethics of controlled human infection (CHI) studies in which participants are intentionally infected with pathogens, often in inpatient settings with extensive follow-up. In this article, I provide support for preserving the right to withdraw from research without penalty and demonstrate that it is also typically justified in the specific context of CHI studies. The right is well aligned with individual freedoms outside the research setting, where autonomous individuals are permitted to engage in behaviors that will foreseeably cause them harm; where they cannot be compelled to satisfy contracts for their services, nor penalized for failure to do so; and where their behavior is not constrained by public health authorities except in extreme circumstances. These freedoms are supported by U.S. law, as well as by ethical analysis that is more globally relevant. The problems associated with the right to withdraw, however, remain. The best approach to addressing them is not to restrict the right but rather to avoid initiating research when withdrawal would be especially problematic. If research proceeds, steps can still be taken to minimize participant withdrawal without infringing the right. Investigators can avoid participant surprise through informed consent focused on a study's most burdensome aspects and promote study completion through financial incentives. Should participants nonetheless seek to withdraw, investigators may attempt to persuade them not to do so by encouraging consideration of the range of potential harms that may result. Researchers conducting CHI studies and other research from which withdrawal might be especially problematic should prepare for the possibility of participant withdrawal, respect participant requests to withdraw without penalty, and incorporate various measures to avoid such requests.","Fernandez Lynch, Holly",Bioethics,207,1

Serologic testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthcare workers (HCWs) may quantify the rate of clinically significant exposure in an institutional setting and identify those HCWs who are at greatest risk. METHODS We conducted a survey and SARS-CoV-2 serologic testing among a convenience sample of HCWs from 79 non-COVID and 3 dedicated COVID hospitals in District Srinagar of Kashmir, India. In addition to testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG), we collected information on demographics, occupational group, influenza-like illness (ILI) symptoms, nasopharyngeal reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing status, history of close unprotected contacts, and quarantine/travel history. RESULTS Of 7,346 eligible HCWs, 2,915 (39.7%) participated in the study. The overall prevalence of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies was 2.5% (95% CI, 2.0%-3.1%), while HCWs who had ever worked at a dedicated COVID-19 hospital had a substantially lower seroprevalence of 0.6% (95% CI, 0.2%-1.9%). Higher seroprevalence rates were observed among HCWs who reported a recent ILI (12.2%), a positive RT-PCR (27.6%), a history of being put under quarantine (4.9%), and a history of close unprotected contact with a person with COVID-19 (4.4%). Healthcare workers who ever worked at a dedicated COVID-19 hospital had a lower multivariate-adjusted risk of seropositivity (odds ratio, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.06-0.66). CONCLUSIONS Our investigation suggests that infection-control practices, including a compliance-maximizing buddy system, are valuable and effective in preventing infection within a high-risk clinical setting. Universal masking, mandatory testing of patients, and residential dormitories for HCWs at COVID-19-dedicated hospitals is an effective multifaceted approach to infection control. Moreover, given that many infections among HCWs are community-acquired, it is likely that the vigilant practices in these hospitals will have spillover effects, creating ingrained behaviors that will continue outside the hospital setting.","Khan, Muhammad Salim; Haq, Inaamul; Qurieshi, Mariya Amin; Majid, Sabhiya; Bhat, Arif Akbar; Qazi, Tanzeela Bashir; Chowdri, Iqra Nisar; Sabah, Iram; Kawoosa, Misbah Ferooz; Lone, Abdul Aziz; Nabi, Shahroz; Sumji, Ishtiyaq Ahmad; Obaid, Muhammad; Kousar, Rafiya",Journal of hospital medicine,207,16

As these conditions are associated with high risk of myocardial dysfunction, we investigated the effects of IFNγ on 3D fibrin-based engineered human cardiac tissues (""cardiobundles""). Cardiobundles were fabricated from human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes, exposed to 0-20ng/ml of IFNγ on culture days 7-14, and assessed for changes in tissue structure, viability, contractile force and calcium transient generation, action potential propagation, cytokine secretion, and expression of select genes and proteins. We found that application of IFNγ induced a dose-dependent reduction in contractile force generation, deterioration of sarcomeric organization, and cardiomyocyte disarray, without significantly altering cell viability, action potential propagation, or calcium transient amplitude. At molecular level, the IFNγ-induced structural and functional deficits could be attributed to altered balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, upregulation of JAK/STAT signaling pathway (JAK1, JAK2, and STAT1), and reduced expression of myosin heavy chain, myosin light chain-2v, and sarcomeric α-actinin. Application of clinically used JAK/STAT inhibitors, tofacitinib and baricitinib, fully prevented IFNγ-induced cardiomyopathy, confirming the critical roles of this signaling pathway in inflammatory cardiac disease. Taken together, our in vitro studies in engineered myocardial tissues reveal direct adverse effects of pro-inflammatory cytokine IFNγ on human cardiomyocytes and establish the foundation for a potential use of cardiobundle platform in modeling of inflammatory myocardial disease and therapy. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, sepsis, lupus erythematosus, Chagas disease, and others, as well as viral infections including H1N1 influenza and COVID-19 show increased systemic levels of a pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon-γ (IFNγ) and are associated with high risk of heart disease. Here we explored for the first time if chronically elevated levels of IFNγ can negatively affect structure and function of engineered human heart tissues in vitro. Our studies revealed IFNγ-induced deterioration of myofibrillar organization and contractile force production in human cardiomyocytes, attributed to decreased expression of multiple sarcomeric proteins and upregulation of JAK/STAT signaling pathway. FDA-approved JAK inhibitors fully blocked the adverse effects of IFNγ, suggesting a potentially effective strategy against human inflammatory cardiomyopathy.","Zhan, Ren-Zhi; Rao, Lingjun; Chen, Zhaowei; Strash, Nicholas; Bursac, Nenad",Acta biomaterialia,207,1

During this process, cells often suffer from exposure to suboptimal life-sustaining conditions (e.g. temperature, pH), as well as damage due to shear stress. We have developed a transport device for shipping intact cell/tissue constructs from one facility to another that overcomes these obstacles. Our transport device maintained three different cell lines (Caco2, A549, and HepG2 C3A) individually on transwell membranes with high viability (above 97%) for 48 h under simulated shipping conditions without an incubator. The device was also tested by actual overnight shipping of blood brain barrier constructs consisting of human induced pluripotent brain microvascular endothelial cells and rat astrocytes on transwell membranes to a remote facility (approximately 1200 miles away). The blood brain barrier constructs arrived with high cell viability and were able to regain full barrier integrity after equilibrating in the incubator for 24 h; this was assessed by the presence of continuous tight junction networks and in vivo-like values for trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER). These results demonstrated that our cell transport device could be a useful tool for long-distance transport of membrane-bound cell cultures and functional tissue constructs. Studies that involve various cell and tissue constructs, such as the ""Multi-Organ-on-Chip"" devices (where multiple microscale tissue constructs are integrated on a single microfluidic device) and studies that involve microenvironments where multiple tissue interactions are of interest, would benefit from the ability to transport or receive these constructs. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

In the setting of virtual interviews for residency in 2020, the online availability of program information is of heightened importance. We sought to assess how academic versus community-based general surgery residency programs compared with respect to certain details on their websites. METHODS A total of n = 268 surgery residency programs were investigated. Our database of website characteristics included: direct link to residency website from the American Council on Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) program page, resident research requirement, listing of residents' publications, availability of residents' demographic information, program alumni information, board pass rates, attrition rate, detail of educational/academic activities, residents' evaluation methods, diversity, and mentorship. Inter-group analyses between academic and community-based programs were performed using Pearson's Chi-squared test. RESULTS Academic and community-based general surgery residency program websites were compared based on twelve (12) different parameters. Statistically significant differences were observed for eight of these comparisons: direct website access from ACGME (p = 0.007), research highlighted (p < 0.001), resident research requirement (p = 0.002), resident demographic information available (p=0.004), alumni information (p = 0.005), resident evaluation methods (p = 0.016), diversity (p < 0.001), and mentorship (p = 0.012). Across these domains, academic programs had more information available on their websites than the community programs did. The program websites did not differ significantly based on the frequency of mentioning resident publications, board pass rate, attrition rate, or resident education. CONCLUSION Many general surgery programs are lacking detailed information on their websites. The amount of website information available on general surgery residency programs differs when comparing academic and community-based programs.","Chinedozi, Ifeanyi; Martin, Olivia; Hays, Nicole; Kubicki, Natalia S; Kidd-Romero, Sarah; Kavic, Stephen M",Journal of surgical education,207,11

The 7MS consists of four subtests (Temporal Orientation, Enhanced Cued Recall, Clock Drawing, and Verbal Fluency), each measuring a different aspect of cognition. The present study is designed to examine the predictive validity of the 7MS to distinguish between patients with early-stage AD and healthy control subjects. METHODS Sixty-three patients who were diagnosed as having probable or possible AD and 91 community-dwelling elderly individuals of comparable age, sex distribution, and education were administered the 7MS (paper-and-pencil version) and other screening batteries. All patients were rated Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) 0.5-1, categorized as early-stage AD, and all participants obtained a score of less than 6 for the Geriatric Depression Scale (15-item version). RESULTS Mean scores for patients and controls on all the four subtests were significantly different. When using the total score of the 7MS, which was calculated by the original logistic regression formula based on all of the four subtests, the sensitivity for early-stage AD was 90.5% with a specificity of 92.3%. Correlation analysis indicated high concurrent validity between the 7MS and existing standard cognitive screening batteries (e.g., MMSE, HDS-R). In correlation analysis and multiple regression analysis, demographic effects (age, sex, and education) were not significantly associated with the total score of the 7MS in controls. CONCLUSIONS The results showed that the 7MS had a high level of sensitivity and specificity. We also found that the 7MS was not affected by demographic characteristics. These findings demonstrated that the 7MS is a useful screening tool for discriminating patients with early-stage AD from intact individuals.","Ijuin, Mutsuo; Homma, Akira; Mimura, Masaru; Kitamura, Shin; Kawai, Yoshiko; Imai, Yukimichi; Gondo, Yasuyuki",Dementia and geriatric cognitive disorders,207,26

Eleven patients (26.2%) presented with tandem occlusions and 31 patients (73.8%) had a single anterior circulation occlusion. Baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups. Recanalization status also did not differ significantly (P=0.76), but patients with tandem occlusions had poorer functional outcomes (18.2% vs. 67.7% for single occlusions; P=0.01), a higher mortality rate at 3 months (45.5% vs. 12.9%, respectively; P=0.03) and more symptomatic intracranial hemorrhages at 24h (9.7% vs. 0%, respectively; P=0.01). A high rate of early proximal re-occlusion or severe residual stenosis (66%) was also observed in the tandem group. CONCLUSION Tandem occlusions had poor clinical outcomes after mechanical thrombectomy compared with single occlusions. The retrograde approach (treatment of distal occlusion first) used in patients under conscious sedation may have contributed to these poor outcomes.","Soize, Sébastien; Kadziolka, Krzysztof; Estrade, Laurent; Serre, Isabelle; Barbe, Coralie; Pierot, Laurent",Journal of neuroradiology.

In addition to testing/contact tracing, behavioural and social responses such as handwashing and social distancing or cocooning are effective tools for mitigating the spread of the disease. Psychological (e.g., risk perceptions, self-efficacy) and contextual factors (government, public health messaging, etc.) are likely to drive these behaviours. Collated real-time information of these indicators strengthens local, national and international public health advice and messaging. Further, understanding how well public health and government messages and measures are understood, communicated via (social) media and adhered to is vital. There are two governments and public health jurisdictions on the island of Ireland, the Republic of Ireland (ROI) and Northern Ireland (NI). This represents an opportunity to explore implications of differing measures and messaging across these two jurisdictions as they relate to COVID-19 on two similar populations. The expert research team are drawn from a range of disciplines in the two countries. This project has four nested studies: Assessment of key behavioural, social and psychological factors through a large, prospective representative telephone survey of individuals aged over-18 on a weekly basis over eight weeks (n=3072); and conduct qualitative focus groups over the same period.Interrogation of social media messaging and formal media responses in both jurisdictions to investigate the spread of (mis)information.Modelling data from Studies 1 and 2, plotting the psychosocial/behavioural and media messaging information with international, ROI and NI incidence and mortality data.

Using an Internet-based remote meeting technology, we transitioned to a virtual platform in April. METHODS We have conducted 12 PFAC meetings across 4 sites to date. Virtual PFAC meeting topics over the past few months include communication about the coronavirus, community resources needed by patients during the pandemic, telehealth visit troubleshooting, current office policy, and changing work flow. A convenience sample of advisors generated qualitative responses on the transition from in-person meetings to a virtual platform. RESULTS Attendance increased as we transitioned to a virtual platform from 13.2 advisors to 14.7 advisors. Advisors affirm the value of a PFAC and importance of patient engagement, especially during this pandemic. Patient advisors confirm the role of patient voice in pandemic-induced practice changes. DISCUSSION The transition of our PFACs to a virtual platform continues to generate critically important partnerships between patients and providers. In this time of health care uncertainty and stress for patients, providers, and staff, this partnership remains our most valuable asset. CONCLUSION Patient voice provides reliable and relevant information for practices through virtual PFAC meetings.","Schlaudecker, Jeffrey D; Goodnow, Keesha",Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine : JABFM,207,1

Rationale for this action includes the changing nature of health care; a greater emphasis on person and family-centered care; nurses' background and experience in health care delivery; and that boards with a more diverse composition are associated with better organizational performance. Several national organizations have come forward to support this, among them the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, American Hospital Association, the Institute of Medicine, and several industry leaders in health care. While progress has been made, however, nurses still occupy only 4% of board seats.

METHODS This cross-sectional study recruited patients with diabetes from 50 institutional/private clinics. DPNP was diagnosed using Douleur Neuropathique 4 (DN4) questionnaire (score ≥4). Health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) and sleep were assessed with EQ-5D and Daily Sleep Interference Scale (DSIS), respectively. RESULTS Prevalence of DPNP was 30.3% (n = 1046). Risk of DPNP was significantly increased in people aged 50-64 years (odds ratio [OR] 1.71, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.21, 2.41), with diabetes for ≥10 years (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.15, 2.08), female patients (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.18, 2.12), and black patients (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.19, 2.46). Mean ± SD EQ-5D and DSIS scores were 0.84 ± 0.16 and 0.83 ± 1.90, respectively, in participants without DPNP versus 0.64 ± 0.25 and 3.62 ± 2.96, respectively, in those with DPNP. CONCLUSIONS DPNP is widely prevalent in South Africa. Despite its negative impact on HRQoL and sleep, DPNP is inadequately treated. DN4 is an easy-to-use, validated questionnaire that can be used widely as a DPNP screening tool in clinical practice.","Jacovides, Andrew; Bogoshi, Mampedi; Distiller, Larry A; Mahgoub, Ehab Y; Omar, Mahomed Ka; Tarek, Ismail A; Wajsbrot, Dalia B",The Journal of international medical research,207,16

Feeding back summarised PROs data, aggregated at the health-service level, to healthcare professionals may inform clinical practice and quality improvement efforts. However, little is known about the best methods for providing these summarised data in a way that is meaningful for this audience. Therefore, the aim of this scoping review was to summarise the emerging approaches to PROs data for 'service-level' feedback to healthcare professionals. SETTING Healthcare professionals receiving PROs data feedback at the health-service level. DATA SOURCES Databases selected for the search were Embase, Ovid Medline, Scopus, Web of Science and targeted web searching. The main search terms included: 'patient-reported outcome measures', 'patient-reported outcomes', 'patient-centred care', 'value-based care', 'quality improvement' and 'feedback'. Studies included were those that were published in English between January 2009 and June 2019. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES Data were extracted on the feedback methods of PROs to patients or healthcare providers. A standardised template was used to extract information from included documents and academic publications. Risk of bias was assessed using Joanna Briggs Institute Levels of Evidence for Effectiveness. RESULTS Overall, 3480 articles were identified after de-duplication. Of these, 19 academic publications and 22 documents from the grey literature were included in the final review. Guiding principles for data display methods and graphical formats were identified. Seven major factors that may influence PRO data interpretation and use by healthcare professionals were also identified. CONCLUSION While a single best format or approach to feedback PROs data to healthcare professionals was not identified, numerous guiding principles emerged to inform the field.","Hancock, Shaun L; Ryan, Olivia F; Marion, Violet; Kramer, Sharon; Kelly, Paulette; Breen, Sibilah; Cadilhac, Dominique A",BMJ open,207,1

Methods HSCs were obtained from feline bone marrow and replicated in vitro. Three lentiviruses were constructed, each expressing a different anti-FCoV miRNA. HSCs were stably transduced with the miRNA-expressing lentivirus vector that produced the most effective viral inhibition in a feline cell line. The effectiveness of the transduction and the expression of anti-FCoV miRNA were tested by infecting the HSCs with two different strains of FCoV. The inhibition of coronavirus replication was determined by relative quantification of the inhibition of intracellular viral genomic RNA synthesis using real-time, reverse-transcription PCR. The assessment of virus replication inhibition was determined via titration of extracellular virus using the TCID50 assay. Results Inhibition of FCoV was most significant in feline cells expressing miRNA-L2 that targeted the viral leader sequence, 48 h postinfection. miRNA-L2 expression in stably transduced HSCs resulted in 90% and 92% reductions in FIPV WSU 79-1146 genomic RNA synthesis and extracellular virus production, respectively, as well as 74% and 80% reduction in FECV WSU 79-1683 genomic RNA synthesis and extracellular virus production, respectively, as compared with an infected negative control sample producing non-targeting miRNA. Conclusions and relevance These preliminary results show that genetic modification of HSCs for constitutive production of anti-coronavirus miRNA will reduce FCoV replication.","Anis, Eman A; Dhar, Madhu; Legendre, Alfred M; Wilkes, Rebecca P",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,207,19

The purpose of the current study was to assess caregiver preferences for on-campus versus virtual learning at home during the fall and factors associated with these preferences. METHODS Participants were caregivers of 4436 children and adolescents who were enrolled in pre-kindergarten through high school at a large, public school district in Texas. Caregivers were asked to complete an anonymous, online survey about their initial preferences for their student's back to the school learning environment. RESULTS Caregivers of high- and middle-school students were more likely to endorse a preference for an on-campus/virtual hybrid instructional format and less likely to endorse a preference for a traditional, face-to-face instructional format compared to caregivers of elementary school students. Regardless of the school level, concerns about child health and safety were the factor most strongly associated with caregiver preferences for on-campus versus virtual learning at home during the fall.

The enzyme catalyzes condensation of farnesyl diphosphate and isopentenyl diphosphate to generate a C(20) product as a precursor for chlorophylls, carotenoids, and geranylgeranylated proteins. The 3D structure of GGPPs from Saccharomyces cerevisiae reveals an unique positioning of the N-terminal helix A, which protrudes into the other subunit and stabilizes dimerization, although it is far from the main dimer interface. Through a series of mutants that were characterized by analytic ultracentrifugation (AUC), the replacement of L8 and I9 at this helix with Gly was found sufficient to disrupt the dimer into a monomer, leading to at least 10(3)-fold reduction in activity. Molecular dynamics simulations and free energy decomposition analyses revealed the possible effects of the mutations on the protein structures and several critical interactions for maintaining dimerization. Further site-directed mutagenesis and AUC studies elucidated the molecular mechanism for modulating dimerization and activity by long-range interactions.","Lo, Chia-Hsiang; Chang, Ying-Hsuan; Wright, Jon D; Chen, Shih-Hsun; Kan, Daphne; Lim, Carmay; Liang, Po-Huang",Journal of the American Chemical Society,207,13

METHODS Twenty-four female 7-week old Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups: Con, administered with vehicle solutions; Cy, treated with Cy; Res + Cy, treated with Cy + Res combined; Res, treated with Res. After 21 d of treatments, the rats were euthanized and blood samples were collected to evaluate the levels of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH). The Ovaries were processed for immunohistochemical and western blotting. RESULTS Cy-treat caused the decrease of body weights and ovarian weight. AMH was lower in Cy group, whereas AMH levels were similar among other groups. Histomorphology showed a large number of primordial follicles were activated in Cy groups, whereas the primordial follicles were inhibited in the Res and Res + Cy groups. The expressions of Sirt1, Foxo3a were up-regulated and p53, Caspase-3, and Bax were down-regulated in Res + Cy and Res groups (p < .05). CONCLUSIONS Res can prevent the primordial follicle activation and decrease apoptosis induced by Cy.

METHODS A cadaveric model with fresh-frozen forearms was used to simulate pinch under two immobilization conditions: (1) forearm-based thumb spica splint alone and (2) forearm-based thumb spica splint with supplemental transarticular MP Kirschner wire fixation. Pinch was simulated by thumb valgus loading and flexor pollicis longus (FPL) loading. Ulnar collateral ligament displacements were measured and strain values calculated. Statistical analysis was performed using a repeated measures analysis of variance model. RESULTS With valgus thumb loading, we noted a significantly lower UCL strain in the splint and pin group compared to splint immobilization alone. Increased load was associated with a statistically significant increase in UCL strain within each immobilization condition. FPL loading resulted in negative displacement, or paradoxical shortening, of the UCL in both immobilization groups. CONCLUSIONS While immobilized, valgus thumb force, as opposed to MP flexion, is a likely contributor to UCL strain during simulated pinch representing noncompliance during the postoperative period. Supplemental thumb MP pin fixation more effectively protects the UCL from valgus strain. UCL shortening with FPL loading likely represents paradoxical MP extension due to flexion of the distal phalanx against the distal splint, suggesting attempted thumb flexion with splint immobilization alone does not jeopardize UCL repair. CLINICAL RELEVANCE This study provides a foundation to aid clinical decision-making after UCL repair. It reinforces the practice of surgeons who routinely pin their MP joints, but also brings to attention that the use of temporary MP pin fixation may be considered in difficult cases, such as those with potential noncompliance or tenuous repair.","Lien, John R; Brunfeldt, Alexander; Julka, Abhishek; Hughes, Richard E; Ozer, Kagan; Lawton, Jeffrey N",Hand,207,19

These sudden control measures led to radical changes in human activities in the Greater London Area (GLA). During this lockdown, transportation use was significantly reduced and non-key workers were required to work from home. This study aims to understand how population exposure to PM2.5 and NO2 changed spatially and temporally across London, in different microenvironments, following the lockdown period relative to the previous three-year average in the same calendar period. Our research shows that population exposure to NO2 declined significantly (52.3% ±6.1%), while population exposure to PM2.5 showed a smaller relative reduction (15.7% ±4.1%). Changes in population activity had the strongest relative influence on exposure levels during morning rush hours, when prior to the lockdown a large percentage of people would normally commute or be at the workplace. In particular, a very high exposure decrease was observed for both pollutants (approximately 66% for NO2 and 19% for PM2.5) at 08:00am, consistent with the radical changes in population commuting. The infiltration of outdoor air pollution into housing modifies the degree of exposure change both temporally and spatially. Moreover, this study shows that the impacts on air pollution exposure vary across groups with different socioeconomic status (SES), with a disproportionate positive effect on the areas of the city home to more economically deprived communities.","Kazakos, Vasilis; Taylor, Jonathon; Luo, Zhiwen",Environmental research,207,24

Eight primary antibodies were tested for immunohistochemistry in formalin-fixed tissues: anti-CD3, anti-CD79α, anti-CD20, anti-HLA-DR, anti-lysozyme, anti-CD163, anti-SWC3, and anti-Mac387. The anti-CD3 antibody labeled T cells mainly in interfollicular and paracortical areas of lymph nodes, cortex and thymic medulla, and periarteriolar lymphoid sheaths in the spleen. The anti-CD79α and anti-CD20 antibodies immunolabeled B cells located in lymphoid follicles at lymph nodes, spleen, and Peyer patches. The CD79α and CD20 antibodies also labeled cells with nonlymphoid morphology in atypical B-cell locations. The anti-HLA-DR antibody labeled macrophages, some populations of B and T lymphocytes, and different populations of dendritic cells in lymph nodes, Peyer patches, spleen, and thymus. The anti-lysozyme antibody immunolabeled macrophages in the liver, lymph nodes, spleen, and thymus. The Mac-387, CD163, and SWC3 antibodies did not show any positive reaction in formalin-fixed or frozen tissues. To elucidate the origin of the uncommon CD79α/CD20 positive cells, a double immunohistochemistry was carried out using the anti-HLA-DR + the anti-CD79α, the anti-HLA-DR + the anti-CD20, and the anti-lysozyme + the anti-CD79α antibodies. Double labeling was mainly observed when the anti-HLA-DR + the anti-CD79α antibodies were combined.

To control the neural activities of BarN, glutamatergic and GABAergic inputs from multiple sources have been demonstrated; however, it is not clear how modulatory neurotransmitters affect the activity of BarN neurons. We have employed knock-in mice, CRH-expressing neurons of which are labeled with a modified yellow fluorescent protein (Venus). Using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, we examined the responses of Venus-expressing (putative CRH-expressing) neurons in BarN (BarCRH), as well as non-CRH-expressing neurons (BarCRH-negative), following bath application of cholinergic agonists. According to the present study, the activity of BarCRH neurons could be modulated by dual cholinergic mechanisms. First, they are inhibited by a muscarinic receptor-mediated mechanism, most likely through the M2 subclass of muscarinic receptors. Second, BarCRH neurons are excited by a nicotinic receptor-mediated mechanism. BarCRH-negative neurons also responded to cholinergic agents. Choline transporter-immunoreactive nerve terminals were observed in close proximity to the neurites, as well as the somata of BarCRH. The present results suggest that BarN neurons are capable of responding to cholinergic input.","Kawatani, Masahiro; Itoi, Keiichi; Talukder, Ashraf Hossain; Uchida, Katsuya; Sakimura, Kenji; Kawatani, Masahito",Journal of neurophysiology,207,8

Costs were extrapolated for a treatment period of 6 months. RESULTS Of the 62 regimens included, the 6-month mean cost of chemotherapy was $26,989 ± $29,971, and the median cost was $9,611 (interquartile range, $6,305-$39,383). The mean cost of metastatic cancer therapy regimens (n = 32) was $35,315 ± 32,962 compared with $18,107 ± 23,873 for curative therapy (P = .02). Of the 13 regimens with biologics used, the mean costs were $77,278 versus $13,646 for 49 regimens that did not use biologics (P<.001). The cost differential between extremes of costs for regimens with presumed similar efficacy was $90,843 ($79,165 for curative therapy and $90,210 for metastatic cancer therapy). The highest cost differential was noted in breast cancer regimens at $71,041 for metastatic cancer therapy and $63,926 for curative therapy. CONCLUSION A significant cost differential exists between chemotherapeutic regimens for the most common solid tumors. Incorporation of costs and incremental effectiveness in current guidelines may encourage socially responsible practice patterns.","Nadeem, Hasan; Jayakrishnan, Thejus T; Rajeev, Rahul; Johnston, Fabian M; Gamblin, T Clark; Turaga, Kiran K",Journal of oncology practice,207,1

The tumour incidence decreases with age, whereas more aggressive behaviour tends to increase. Haemorrhage as a presenting feature of pilocytic astrocytomas is a rare phenomenon, especially in the adult population. We present a case of a 55-year-old patient with progressive headaches and dizziness. MRI confirmed a sellar and predominantly retrochiasmal suprasellar lesion with heterogeneous signal, enhancement and blood products. Management via transsphenoidal approach was performed, and histopathology revealed the unexpected diagnosis of haemorrhagic pilocytic astrocytoma. Haemorrhagic pilocytic astrocytoma is an infrequent entity in the adult population and it is essential to recognise the peculiarities regarding diagnostic evaluation and management, which differ from the paediatric population.

These consist of a reticular mesh coated or interwoven/knitted with inert materials. This study assesses the performance of two reticular polypropylene-containing hybrid meshes, TiMESH (coated with titanium) and DynaMesh (interwoven with polyvinylidene fluoride), in vitro, as well as their efficiency in adhesion prevention and tissue incorporation in an intraperitoneal model. METHODS The mesothelialization capacity of TiMESH and DynaMesh was evaluated in vitro and compared to that of Surgipro (reticular bare polypropylene) and Preclude (laminar expanded polytetrafluoroethylene). Mesh fragments were placed on the intact parietal peritoneum of New Zealand white rabbits (n = 24), and laparoscopy performed 7 days post-surgery. Fourteen days post-implantation, adhesions were evaluated and host tissue incorporation, macrophage response, collagen expression (immunohistochemistry/RT-PCR) and neoperitoneum formation assessed. Adhesions and omental tissue were also examined. RESULTS Mesh pores in reticular meshes were devoid of cells in the in vitro study. TiMESH, DynaMesh and Surgipro showed similar adhesion rates at 7/14 days and optimal tissue integration, with significant differences in comparison to Preclude. The greatest presence of macrophages was observed for TiMESH and was significant versus that for Preclude. Hybrid meshes revealed significantly higher collagen 1 mRNA expression in implants, with no differences in the levels of collagen 3. Omental samples from animals with a reticular mesh showed significantly greater collagen 1 mRNA levels. CONCLUSIONS The reticular structure of a mesh limits the formation of a continuous mesothelial monolayer in vitro, regardless of its composition. The presence of titanium as a coating or polyvinylidene fluoride interwoven with polypropylene in a reticular structure did not prevent adhesions. The hybrid meshes showed proper integration and an increase in the mRNA Col 1 levels in the implant area compared to Surgipro or Preclude.","Gómez-Gil, Verónica; Rodríguez, Marta; García-Moreno Nisa, Francisca; Pérez-Köhler, Bárbara; Pascual, Gemma",PloS one,207,16

The principal receptor for MHV is murine CEACAM1 (mCEACAM1). Susceptible strains of mice are homozygous for the 1a allele of mCeacam1, while SJL mice are homozygous for the 1b allele. mCEACAM1a (1a) has a 10- to 100-fold-higher receptor activity than does mCEACAM1b (1b). To explore the hypothesis that MHV susceptibility is due to the different MHV receptor activities of 1a and 1b, we established a chimeric C57BL/6 mouse (cB61ba) in which a part of the N-terminal immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain of the mCeacam1a (1a) gene, which is responsible for MHV receptor function, is replaced by the corresponding region of mCeacam1b (1b). We compared the MHV susceptibility of these chimeric mice to that of SJL and B6 mice. B6 mice that are homozygous for 1a are highly susceptible to MHV-A59 infection, with a 50% lethal dose (LD(50)) of 10(2.5) PFU, while chimeric cB61ba mice and SJL mice homozygous for 1ba and 1b, respectively, survived following inoculation with 10(5) PFU. Unexpectedly, cB61ba mice were more resistant to MHV-A59 infection than SJL mice as measured by virus replication in target organs, including liver and brain. No infectious virus or viral RNA was detected in the organs of cB61ba mice, while viral RNA and infectious virus were detected in target organs of SJL mice. Furthermore, SJL mice produced antiviral antibodies after MHV-A59 inoculation with 10(5) PFU, but cB61ba mice did not. Thus, cB61ba mice are apparently completely resistant to MHV-A59 infection, while SJL mice permit low levels of MHV-A59 virus replication during self-limited, asymptomatic infection. When expressed on cultured BHK cells, the mCEACAM1b and mCEACAM1ba proteins had similar levels of MHV-A59 receptor activity. These results strongly support the hypothesis that although alleles of mCEACAM1 are the principal determinants of mouse susceptibility to MHV-A59, other as-yet-unidentified murine genes may also play a role in susceptibility to MHV.","Hirai, Asuka; Ohtsuka, Nobuhisa; Ikeda, Toshio; Taniguchi, Rie; Blau, Dianna; Nakagaki, Keiko; Miura, Hideka S; Ami, Yasushi; Yamada, Yasuko K; Itohara, Shigeyoshi; Holmes, Kathryn V; Taguchi, Fumihiro",Journal of virology,207,1

Host defense peptides (HDPs), previously known as antimicrobial peptides, are emerging as a group of promising antimicrobial candidates for combatting AMR due to their rapid and unique antimicrobial action. Decades of research have advanced our understanding of the relationship between the physicochemical properties of HDPs and their underlying antimicrobial and non-antimicrobial functions, including immunomodulatory, anti-biofilm, and wound healing properties. However, the mission of translating novel HDP-derived molecules from bench to bedside has yet to be fully accomplished, primarily attributed to their intricate structure-activity relationship, toxicity, instability in host and microbial environment, lack of correlation between in vitro and in vivo efficacies, and dwindling interest from large pharmaceutical companies. Based on our previous experience and the expanding knowledge gleaned from the literature, this review aims to summarize the novel strategies that have been employed to enhance the antimicrobial efficacy, proteolytic stability, and cell selectivity, which are all crucial factors for bench-to-bedside translation of HDP-based treatment. Strategies such as residues substitution with natural and/or unnatural amino acids, hybridization, L-to-D heterochiral isomerization, C- and N-terminal modification, cyclization, incorporation with nanoparticles, and ""smart design"" using artificial intelligence technology, will be discussed.

Robotic-assisted thoracic surgery (RATS) is considered a safe and practical method for segmentectomy. Few studies have compared robotic surgery and video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) for lung segmentectomy. METHOD We retrospectively examined 215 consecutive patients who underwent typical (88 patients) or atypical (128 patients) segmentectomy by either robotic surgery or VATS. The postoperative characteristics including operation time, blood loss, pneumonia, tumor size, lymph nodes harvested, chest tube duration, prolonged air leak, atrial fibrillation, and postoperative hospital stay were recorded. RESULTS A total of 88 patients underwent typical segmentectomy, while 127 patients underwent atypical segmentectomy. A greater number of lymph nodes were resected via RATS than by VATS (13.24 ± 4.84 vs. 11.71 ± 3.89; P = 0.018). The operation time for typical segmentectomy was shorter than that for atypical segmentectomy (115.69 ± 22.32 vs. 131.68 ± 22.52; P = 0). No significant differences were found between RATS and VATS in terms of chest drainage duration and postoperative hospital stay. The incidence of postoperative complications including prolonged air leak and atrial fibrillation was not significantly different between typical segmentectomy and atypical segmentectomy. CONCLUSION Atypical segmentectomy is more complicated than typical segmentectomy, which may lead to increases in complications and operation time. Robotic surgery was safe and practical for segmentectomy compared to VATS and more lymph nodes could be dissected by RATS without increasing the risk of postoperative complications.","Xie, Boheng; Sun, Xiao; Qin, Yi; Liu, Ao; Miao, Shuncheng; Jiao, Wenjie",Thoracic cancer,207,1

This study aimed to explore the trajectories of perinatal depressive symptoms, their heterogeneity of onsets and peaks, and relations to demographic and psychological factors. METHOD A longitudinal study was conducted at two hospitals in China amongst 1,126 participants. Perinatal depression was measured using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Demographic and psychological factors were collected by self-developed questionnaire and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7. Women completing at least three depression screens (n = 879) were included. Latent Growth Curve Model and Growth Mixture Model were performed to identify the depression trajectories and logistic regression was used to analyse factors of trajectories. RESULTS Three trajectories were identified: 90.0% of women never presented with depressive symptoms (""Low-throughout""); 5.1% presented with depressive symptoms mainly during the antenatal period (""Antenatal-high""); 4.9% presented with depressive symptoms mainly during the postpartum period (""Postpartum-high""). 52.4% of women experienced their first depressive symptoms during early pregnancy. Suffering from anxiety and being unsatisfied with their marriage were associated with the ""Antenatal-high"" and ""Postpartum-high"" trajectories, respectively. LIMITATIONS Response rate was not high. We also do not have information on clinical diagnoses or changes in some variables over time. CONCLUSIONS We identified three trajectories and heterogeneity existed concerning the timing of their peaks. Women should be considered for depression screening and intervention in early pregnancy.

Recently, histone lysine methylation has been demonstrated to be involved in the development of human solid tumors due to its epigenetic stability and some other advantages. The 90-kb protein methyltransferase nuclear receptor SET domain-containing 2 (NSD2) is a member of nuclear receptor SET domain-containing (NSD) protein lysine methyltransferase (KMT) family, which can cause epigenomic aberrations via altering the methylation states. Studies have shown that NSD2 is frequently over-expressed in multiple types of aggressive solid tumors, including breast cancer, renal cancer, prostate cancer, cervical cancer, and osteosarcoma, and such up-regulation has been linked to poor prognosis and recurrence. Further studies have identified that over-expression of NSD2 promotes cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT), suggesting its potential oncogenic role in solid tumors. Moreover, Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) was searched for validation of prognostic value of NSD2 in human solid tumors. However, the underlying specific mechanism remains unclear. In our present work, we summarized the latest advances in NSD2 expression and clinical applications in solid tumors, and our findings provided valuable insights into the targeted therapeutic regimens of solid tumors.","Chen, Rui; Chen, Yan; Zhao, Weiqing; Fang, Cheng; Zhou, Wenjie; Yang, Xin; Ji, Mei",OncoTargets and therapy,207,16

Lower socioeconomic status often occurs in concert with lower educational attainment, for example. Because literacy provides access to information needed to avoid infection and content can be made more accessible, it is essential to determine to what extent health literacy contributes to successful containment of a pandemic. By incorporating this information into clinical data, we have isolated literacy and geographic location as SDoH factors uniquely related to the risk of COVID-19 infection. For patients with comorbidities linked to higher illness severity, residents of rural areas associated with lower health literacy at the zip code level had a greater likelihood of positive COVID-19 results unrelated to their economic status.","Greer, Melody L; Sample, Steven; Jensen, Hanna K; McBain, Sacha; Lipschitz, Riley; Sexton, Kevin W",Studies in health technology and informatics,207,1

The purpose of this study was to evaluate weight and comorbidity outcomes comparing revisional LRYGB (rLRYGB) with primary LRYGB (pLRYGB). METHODS Retrospective single-centre case-matched analysis was conducted at a bariatric tertiary referral centre. Between January 2009 and July 2013, 239 patients were entered into a prospective database, and 32 patients undergoing rLRYGB (cases) were matched with 32 patients undergoing pLRYGB (controls) for sex, age and BMI. The end point was data at 3 years of follow-up. Thirty-one patients (12.9%) were lost to follow-up during the study period. RESULTS There were no significant differences in patient demographics or median BMI (kg/m2) for pLRYGB or rLRYGB (42.8 ± 12.1 vs. 42.3 ± 11.5, respectively; p = 0.748). Coexisting comorbidities were rated similarly in both groups. At 3 years, the percentage of excess weight loss (74.4 ± 23.3 vs 52.0 ± 26, respectively; p = 0.007) was higher for pLRYGB than rLRYGB, while similar improvements of coexisting comorbidities could be observed. CONCLUSION rLRYGB is a feasible and practical surgical approach that allows effective weight loss at 3 years of follow-up and alleviates refractory reflux symptoms. Although weight loss is lower compared to pLRYGB, resolution or improvement of coexisting comorbidities appears similar. Therefore, rLRYGB seems to be a reliable procedure to address failure after LSG.","Malinka, Thomas; Zerkowski, Jens; Katharina, Itskovich; Borbèly, Yves Michael; Nett, Philipp; Kröll, Dino",Obesity surgery,207,24

DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL from 1997 until November 2018. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Controlled and uncontrolled studies in LTCFs measuring intervention effects on rates of overall antibiotic use and/or appropriateness of use were included. Secondary outcomes were intervention implementation barriers from process evaluations. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two reviewers independently applied the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care group's resources to classify interventions and assess risk of bias. Meta-analyses used random effects models to pool results. RESULTS Of include studies (n=19), 10 had a control group and 17 had a high risk of bias. All interventions had multiple components. Eight studies (with high risk of bias) showed positive impacts on outcomes and included one of the following interventions: audit and feedback, introduction of care pathways or an infectious disease team. Meta-analyses on change in the percentage of residents on antibiotics (pooled relative risk (RR) (three studies, 6862 residents): 0.85, 95% CI: 0.61 to 1.18), appropriateness of decision to treat with antibiotics (pooled RR (three studies, 993 antibiotic orders): 1.10, 95% CI: 0.64 to 1.91) and appropriateness of antibiotic selection for respiratory tract infections (pooled RR (three studies, 292 orders): 1.15, 95% CI: 0.95 to 1.40), showed no significant intervention effects. However, meta-analyses only included results from intervention groups since most studies lacked a control group. Insufficient data prevented meta-analysis on other outcomes.

This high mortality rate leads many providers to feel that the treatment of pTBI is futile. Contrary to this point of view, several studies have shown that victims of pTBI who present with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) ≥6 have a reasonable chance of a meaningful outcome. This study sought to investigate outcomes of pTBI patients based on GCS score who underwent neurosurgical intervention (craniotomy or craniectomy) and compare them with patients who did not undergo surgical intervention. MATERIALS AND METHODS The study represents a secondary analysis of the data that were collected from 2006 to 2016 from 17 institutions as part of a multi-center study, investigating clinical outcomes for adult patients sustaining pTBI and surviving >72 h. Patients were divided into those with GCS 3-5 and those with GCS ≥6. Within these groups, patients were stratified by whether they received surgical intervention, compared with standard non-surgical care. Patient level data (age and gender), clinical data (Injury Severity Score and Abbreviated Injury Score), GCS on admission, post-op infection rates, and outcomes data (mortality, length of stay [LOS], intensive care unit LOS) were collected. Both groups were compared using independent sample t-test or chi-squared test. RESULTS Seven hundred twenty patients with pTBI were identified over 11 y, out of which 336 (46.7%) underwent surgery. The mean Injury Severity Score and Abbreviated Injury Score on admission were higher in the surgical intervention group than their non-surgical counterpart in patients with a GCS ≥6 (P < 0.0001). Patients with GCS of 3-5 with surgical intervention demonstrated a higher survival rate than non-surgical patients (P < 0.0001). In the GCS ≥6 group, surgical intervention did not impact near-term mortality. Intensive care unit LOS was significantly longer in the surgical intervention group in patients with GCS ≥ 6 (P < 0.0001) and GCS of 3-5 (P < 0.0001), as was total hospital LOS (P < 0.0001). Patients with a GCS 3-5 and ≥6 who underwent surgical intervention were more likely to develop a central nervous system infection (P = 0.016; P = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS Surgical intervention in pTBI patients with GCS 3-5 results in improved mortality but comes at a cost of increased resource utilization in the form of longer LOS and higher infection rate. On the other hand, in patients with GCS ≥6, surgery does not provide significant benefits in patient survival. Future prospective studies providing insight as to the impact of surgery on the resource utilization and quality of survival would be beneficial in determining the need for surgical intervention in this population.","D'Agostino, Robyn; Kursinskis, Alexandra; Parikh, Priti; Letarte, Peter; Harmon, Laura; Semon, Gregory",The Journal of surgical research,207,1

The data regarding palliative team involvement in patients with COVID-19, however, remains scarce. We aimed to investigate outcomes of palliative team involvement for the patients with COVID-19 in NYC. METHODS Consecutive 225 patients with confirmed COVID-19 requiring hospitalization in our urban academic medical center in NYC were analyzed. Patients were divided into 2 groups, those with a palliative care consult (palliative group: 14.2% [n = 32]) versus those with no palliative care consult (no palliative group: 85.8% [n = 193]). RESULTS The palliative group was older and had more comorbidities. During the hospital course, the palliative group had more intensive care unit stays, rapid response team activations, and more use of vasopressors (P < .05). Patients with palliative care had higher rates of invasive mechanical ventilation than those without (46.9% vs 10.4%, P < .001). Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed in 12 patients (6.5% vs 5.2%, P = .77) and death rate was 100% in both subsets. Notably, initial code status was not different between the 2 groups, however, code status at discharge was significantly different between them (P < .001). The rate of full code decreased by 70% in the palliative group and by 47.5% in the no palliative care group from admission to the time of death. CONCLUSIONS Critically ill patients hospitalized for COVID-19 benefit from palliative team consults by helping to clarify advanced directives and minimize futile resuscitative efforts.","Obata, Reiichiro; Maeda, Tetsuro; Rizk, Dahlia; Kuno, Toshiki",The American journal of hospice & palliative care,207,28

COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown from 9 March to 16 May 2020 have potentially influenced several activities, including ECs. OBJECTIVES to assess the impact of COVID-19 outbreak on Italian ECs and their performance during the lockdown. DESIGN cross-sectional survey. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS the survey was conducted in mid-June 2020 in Italy contacting all the 90 local ECs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES amount and kind of activities performed during the lockdown, characteristics of submitted studies and adoption of standard protocols of evaluation of research applications during the pandemic. Chi-square test was used to estimate the differences between territories with higher incidence (HI) and lower incidence (LI) of COVID-19. RESULTS 258 questionnaires were collected from 46 ECs that participated in the study. Ten were excluded due to missing substantial data. Responses were divided into two groups according to location of EC: the HI (125 responses) and the LI (123 responses). Seventy-five percent of the HI describe an increase in the number of studies submitted, while 53% of the LI does not (p=0.001). Due to the pandemic and its effects on research, the 15% of participants belonging to HI territories reported that consideration and respect of research-related and general ethical principles could have decreased, as well the adoption of standard protocols of evaluation of research applications. EC secretariats located in HI Regions moved to smart working more than in LI ones (75% vs 59%; p=0.001). Where the EC workload increased significantly, it was reported that it was impossible to perform an accurate analysis of the submitted documentation, with the effect of providing a favorable opinion to studies of not excellent quality, though always ensuring the respect of ethical principles and patients' safety. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 impact on ECs has been heavier in HI territories, but smart working has been effective in ensuring EC activities and the subsequent activation of clinical studies potentially useful to face the pandemic. Clear differences arise between ECs belonging to the Italian Regions that have recorded a HI of COVID-19 cases compared to those located in Regions with a LI of cases. In some EC members' perception, the high number of studies in the most affected Regions together with the emergency experienced during the lockdown may have exposed ECs to the risk of decreasing the adoption of ethical principles and standard protocols of evaluation of research applications.","Monaco, Eleonora; Pisano, Lorenza; Nasato, Laura; Lorenzoni, Giulia; Gregorio, Dario; Martinato, Matteo",Epidemiologia e prevenzione,207,16

A point-of-care biochemical marker for AMS could have widespread utility. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) rises in response to renal injury, inflammation and oxidative stress. We investigated whether NGAL rises with HA and if this rise was related to AMS, hypoxia or exercise. NGAL was assayed in a cohort (n = 22) undertaking 6 hours exercise at near sea-level (SL); a cohort (n = 14) during 3 hours of normobaric hypoxia (FiO2 11.6%) and on two trekking expeditions (n = 52) to over 5000 m. NGAL did not change with exercise at SL or following normobaric hypoxia. During the trekking expeditions NGAL levels (ng/ml, mean ± sd, range) rose significantly (P < 0.001) from 68 ± 14 (60-102) at 1300 m to 183 ± 107 (65-519); 143 ± 66 (60-315) and 150 ± 71 (60-357) at 3400 m, 4270 m and 5150 m respectively. At 5150 m there was a significant difference in NGAL between those with severe AMS (n = 7), mild AMS (n = 16) or no AMS (n = 23): 201 ± 34 versus 171 ± 19 versus 124 ± 12 respectively (P = 0.009 for severe versus no AMS; P = 0.026 for mild versus no AMS). In summary, NGAL rises in response to prolonged hypobaric hypoxia and demonstrates a relationship to the presence and severity of AMS.","Mellor, Adrian; Boos, Christopher; Stacey, Mike; Hooper, Tim; Smith, Chris; Begley, Joe; Yarker, Jo; Piper, Rick; O'Hara, John; King, Rod; Turner, Steve; Woods, David R",Disease markers,207,5

AIM To identify tools used to assess for the presence or risk of problematic opioid use in palliative care. DESIGN Scoping review. DATA SOURCES Bibliographic databases (inception to January 31, 2020), reference lists, and grey literature were searched to find primary studies reporting on adults receiving palliative care and prescription opioids to manage symptoms from advanced cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, or end-stage organ diseases; and included tools to assess for problematic opioid use. There were no restrictions based on study design, location, or language. RESULTS We identified 42 observational studies (total 14,431 participants) published between 2009 and 2020 that used questionnaires (n = 32) and urine drug tests (n = 21) to assess for problematic opioid use in palliative care, primarily in US (n = 38) and outpatient palliative care settings (n = 36). The questionnaires were Cut down, Annoyed, Guilty, and Eye-opener (CAGE, n = 8), CAGE-Adapted to Include Drugs (CAGE-AID, n = 6), Opioid Risk Tool (n = 9), Screener and Opioid Assessment for Patients with Pain (SOAPP; n = 3), SOAPP-Revised (n = 2), and SOAPP-Short Form (n = 5). Only two studies' primary objectives were to evaluate a questionnaire's psychometric properties in patients receiving palliative care. There was wide variation in how urine drug tests were incorporated into palliative care; frequency of abnormal urine drug test results ranged from 8.6% to 70%. CONCLUSION Given the dearth of studies using tools developed or validated specifically for patients receiving palliative care, further research is needed to inform clinical practice and policy regarding problematic opioid use in palliative care.","Lau, Jenny; Mazzotta, Paolo; Fazelzad, Rouhi; Ryan, Suzanne; Tedesco, Alissa; Smith, Andrew J; Sud, Abhimanyu; Furlan, Andrea D; Zimmermann, Camilla",Palliative medicine,207,16

Additionally, the cerebral fractional tissue oxygen extraction (cFTOE) was calculated to analyze whether cerebral activity is linked to cFTOE. METHODS A total of 244 term neonates delivered by primary cesarean section were studied. In addition to routine monitoring with pulse oximetry, aEEG and NIRS measurements were performed during the first 15min after birth. The mean minimum (Vmin) and maximum (Vmax) amplitude of the cerebral activity as well as crSO2 and cFTOE for each minute was determined. Neonates with initial Vmin<5μV or Vmax<10μV, which normalized during transition (study group) were compared to neonates with normal aEEG values throughout the whole monitoring period (control group). RESULTS 9 neonates fulfilled inclusion criteria to the study group and were compared to 50 neonates in the control group. Vmin, Vmax, crSO2, SpO2 and cFTOE were compared from the 4th to 15thmin after birth. During our study period, Vmin and Vmax were significantly lower in the study group than in the control group. crSO2 was significantly lower in the study group until minute 11, dropping below the 10th centile in minute 8. cFTOE was significantly higher in the study group until minute 10, rising above the 90th centile in minutes 8 and 9. SpO2 was within normal ranges in both groups. crSO2 and cFTOE were within normal ranges in the control group. CONCLUSION The present study demonstrates that neonates with initially low cerebral activity during immediate transition after birth concurrently showed low crSO2 (<10th percentile), but increased cerebral oxygen extraction (cFTOE>90th percentile). Cerebral monitoring with aEEG and NIRS might provide useful information on the neonates' condition during immediate transition.","Tamussino, Anna; Urlesberger, Berndt; Baik, Nariae; Schwaberger, Bernhard; Binder-Heschl, Corinna; Schmölzer, Georg M; Avian, Alexander; Pichler, Gerhard",Resuscitation,207,31

MATERIALS AND METHODS A questionnaire was designed and used to survey medical services for liver transplant recipients seen at our center in terms of COVID-19 infection. RESULTS Twenty-five patients infected with COVID-19 were identified from 265 liver transplant recipients. Most patients were male and had COVID-19 despite quarantine at home. All patients received modified immunosuppressive drugs during infection with COVID-19 with minor changes in routine immunosuppressive therapy. Among the identified patients, 21 recovered and 4 patients died. One of the dead patients, in addition to having a liver transplant, had brain cancer with metastasis to the lungs. CONCLUSIONS In liver transplant recipients infected with COVID-19, immunosuppressive drugs seemed to cause only mild to moderate illnesses or even helped them recover from the disease. However, more evidence is needed to prove this hypothesis. It is also recommended that transplant recipients should be warned about personal hygiene and be monitored closely by organ transplant centers.","Sheikhalipour, Zahra; Kermani, Touraj Asvadi; Kakaei, Farzad; Farshbaf Khalili, Azizeh; Vahedi, Leila",Experimental and clinical transplantation : official journal of the Middle East Society for Organ Transplantation,207,22

A failure of conservative therapy requires surgical ligation to prevent continued fluid and protein losses. This article examines a 15-year experience with thoracoscopic ligation of the thoracic duct. PATIENTS AND METHODS From June 1999 to December 2013, 21 patients presented with chylothorax refractory to conservative management. Sixteen patients presented following cardiac procedures, 1 after tracheoesophageal fistula repair, 1 after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation cannulation, and 1 after trauma, and 2 had congenital chylothorax. Ages ranged from 3 weeks to 5 years, and weights ranged from 2.6 to 12.7 kg. All procedures were performed in the right chest with three ports. All cases consisted of sealing of the duct at the level of the diaphragm, a mechanical pleurodesis, and fibrin glue. RESULTS All cases were completed successfully thoracoscopically. Operative time ranged from 20 to 55 minutes. There were no intraoperative complications. One patient with congenital bilateral chylothorax required a left partial pleurectomy. The chest tube duration postoperatively ranged from 4 to 14 days. Ligation failed in 2 patients, requiring a subsequent thoracoscopic pleurectomy and chemical pleurodesis, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Thoracoscopic thoracic duct ligation is a safe and effective procedure even in post-cardiac surgery patients. The site of the leak can be identified in the majority of cases, and tissue-sealing technology appears to be effective. The minimally invasive nature of the procedure has led to more expedient operative repair to avoid the morbidity associated with chyle leak.","Slater, Bethany J; Rothenberg, Steven S",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

METHODS In total, 51 adult patients who were scheduled for varicose vein stripping surgery were sedated with propofol and remifentanil during the surgery, after administration of midazolam. Target concentrations at the effect site of the two drugs were changed based on the patient's status. Respiratory support was applied in the order of oxygen supply, chin lift, and assisted mask ventilation. Target concentrations at the effect site of propofol and remifentanil, the need for respiratory support, and a six-point rating scale satisfaction score were the outcome measurements. RESULTS Only one patient did not require oxygen, eight patients needed oxygen alone, 22 patients required use of the chin lift technique, and 20 patients were assisted with mask ventilation. There was no significant difference in the target concentration of propofol or remifentanil between the patients who required mask ventilation and those who did not. Fifty of the 51 patients reported a satisfaction score of 6. CONCLUSIONS Although MAC using low target concentrations of propofol and remifentanil during vein stripping surgery was satisfactory to patients, close observation regarding the need for respiratory assistance was necessary.","Cho, Sooyoung; Han, Jong In; Baik, Hee Jung; Kim, Dong Yeon; Chun, Eun Hee",Korean journal of anesthesiology,207,16

OBJECTIVE To synthesize available evidence on the state of the implementation of family-centered rounds (FCRs), including identified barriers to stakeholder acceptance and participation in FCRs in pediatric inpatient settings and implementation strategies to increase adherence and related outcomes. DATA SOURCES PubMed and Medline and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. STUDY SELECTION Observational and experimental studies from January 2009 to July 2020. DATA EXTRACTON Two reviewers independently screened each study to determine eligibility and extract data. Initial evidence quality was evaluated on the basis of study design. RESULTS A total of 53 studies were included in the final synthesis. FCRs are increasingly accepted by stakeholders, although participation lags. Structural barriers to nurse and family attendance persist. Limited high-quality evidence exists regarding the effectiveness of FCRs and related implementation strategies in improving patient outcomes. The lack of a clear, consistent definition of the elements that combine for a successful FCR encounter remains a significant barrier to measuring its effect. CONCLUSIONS Standardized research methods for improving the quality and comparability of FCR studies are needed to enhance the existing guidelines for FCR use.

METHODS AND MATERIALS Patients diagnosed with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (cT2-4a,N0/X,M0/X) without nodal or distant metastases between 2008 and 2016 were identified through the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Multilevel logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the hospital specific probability of undergoing a cystectomy. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to assess the case-mix adjusted effect of hospital-specific probabilities on survival. RESULTS Of the 9,215 included patients, 4,513 (49%) underwent a RC. The percentage of RCs varied between 7% and 83% by hospital of diagnosis before the introduction of the first volume criteria (i.e., 2008-2009; minimum of 10 RCs). This variation decreased slightly to 17%-77% after establishment of the second volume criteria (i.e., 2015-2016; minimum of 20 RCs). Age, cT-stage and comorbidity were inversely and socioeconomic status was positively associated with RC. Both being diagnosed in a community hospital and/or being diagnosed in a hospital fulfilling the RC volume criteria were associated with increased use of RC compared to academic hospitals and hospitals not fulfilling the volume criteria. For each 10% increase in the percentage of RC in the hospital of diagnosis, 2-year case-mix adjusted survival increased 4% (hazard ratio 0.96, 95% confidence interval 0.94-0.98). CONCLUSION Probability of RC varied between hospitals of diagnosis and affected 2-year overall survival. Undergoing a RC was associated with age, cT-stage, socioeconomic status, type of hospital, and whether the hospital of diagnosis fulfilled the RC volume criteria. Future research is needed to identify patient, tumor, and hospital characteristics affecting utilization of curative treatment as this may benefit overall survival.","Ripping, Theodora M; Witjes, J Alfred; Meijer, Richard P; van Rhijn, Bas W G; Oddens, Jorg R; Goossens-Laan, Catharina A; Mulder, Sasja F; van Moorselaar, Reindert J A; Kiemeney, Lambertus A; Aben, Katja K H",Urologic oncology,207,11

METHODS A systematic search of the literature in MEDLINE, PubMed Central and EMBASE databases between 1990 and 2020 was carried out to identify all cases of BEF. The initial database search identified 19,452 articles, of which 183 (251 individual patient cases) were included in the final analysis. RESULTS Main causes of BEF were congenital malformations (97/251, 38.7%) and infections (82/251, 32.7%), while 33/251 (13.1%) fistulae were regarded as idiopathic and 39/251 (15.5%) attributed to other causes. Esophagograpy was the most sensitive method of diagnosis (97.4%) compared with esophagoscopy (78.9%), computed tomography (49.6%) and bronchoscopy (46.0%). Definitive treatment was surgical for 176 patients (70%), endoscopic for 25 (10%) and medical for 37 (14.7%). Compared with congenital BEFs, infective BEFs had shorter median symptom duration and were distributed more proximally over the bronchial tree. Definitive treatment was almost only surgical for congenital BEFs, while infective BEFs were treated also endoscopically (12%) and by medical therapy (38%). Morbidity, treatment failure and recurrence rates were higher for infective BEFs. CONCLUSIONS BEFs are rare. Symptoms are non-specific and a high index of suspicion is necessary for diagnosis. Patients with infective BEF tend to have a more severe clinical picture than those with congenital BEF. Surgery is the main treatment for patients affected by congenital BEF, while infective BEFs may heal conservatively.","Mammana, Marco; Pangoni, Alessandro; Lorenzoni, Giulia; Catelli, Chiara; Natale, Giuseppe; Gregori, Dario; Dell'Amore, Andrea; Rea, Federico",World journal of surgery,207,5

The patches in the lower row should be calorimetrically identical, while the color of the patches in the upper row should vary progressively in constant steps of CIELAB color difference along selected color space vector directions. Prospective observers are instructed to indicate the patch pair number for which they begin to perceive a slight color difference between corresponding patches. The frequency data obtained from the observers was used to build a threshold color-difference model. The intention was to validate the method with theoretical data to determine the effect of the precision with which the strips are constructed, on the accuracy of the estimated parameters. Theoretical frequency data was generated using the CIE94 color difference formula, whose associated color discrimination ellipsoid parameters are very easy to determine, associated with a hypothetical logistic psychometric curve for different color centers. The proposed method allows to determine color discrimination parameters with a precision nearby 4% and an accuracy of 3% with respect to the simulated theoretical parameters, for color samples generated with a standard deviation of ΔEab∗=0.2 of the superimposed error around the ideal color difference of pairs of patches.","Brusola, Fernando; Tortajada, Ignacio; Lengua, Ismael; Jordá, Begoña; Peris-Fajarnés, Guillermo",Optics express,207,19

METHODS To estimate state demand, we applied the methodology from our 2005 analysis to calculate full-time equivalent (FTE) EMBC EP demand for each emergency department (ED). The 2017 National Emergency Department Inventory-USA provided visit volumes for all EDs, while the American Board of Medical Specialties supplied the 2017 number of EMBC EPs per state. Assuming at least one EMBC EP should be present 24/7 in each ED (requiring 5.35 FTEs minimum), we calculated the total FTEs required by dividing each ED's visit volume by the estimated average visits seen by an EMBC EP (3,548 visits per year), and then summed FTEs by state. The U.S. Census Bureau provided state demographic characteristics. We used multivariable linear regression to examine the association between state demographics and the density of EMBC EPs per state, and compared 2017 results to our prior 2005 analysis. RESULTS There were 40,716 total EMBC EPs in 2017, fulfilling 77% of the estimated national demand. This was a substantial increase from 23,035 total EMBC EPs fulfilling 58% of demand in 2005. The 2017 supply ranged from 24% of demand in North Dakota to 142% in Hawaii. A lower density of EMBC EPs was associated with states in the Midwest and South (p<0.001) and with a more rural population (p=0.02). The absolute shortage of EMBC EPs worsened or remained the same in one-fourth of states. CONCLUSION While the total number of EMBC EPs nearly doubled between 2005 and 2017, a shortage of full-time coverage persists. The supply and demand vary greatly by state. Worsening absolute shortages in several states show that the distribution of EMBC EPs is not meeting demand across the U.S, particularly in rural areas.","Clay, Carson E; Sullivan, Ashley F; Bennett, Christopher L; Boggs, Krislyn M; Espinola, Janice A; Camargo, Carlos A",Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine,207,33

However, the heterogeneity of cohorts and the lack of consideration of confounding in the published literature raise potential biases. The aim of this study was to pool all available matched data comparing outcomes of mitral valve repair and replacement in the setting of primary mitral regurgitation. RECENT FINDINGS We searched Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Library Central Register of Controlled Trials to identify propensity-matched studies or reports with multivariable adjustment comparing repair and replacement in patients with primary mitral regurgitation. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. DerSimonian and Laird random effects were used to perform the meta-analysis. Eight observational studies were selected including 4599 patients (3064 mitral repairs and 1535 replacements). Mean age ranged from 62 to 69 years, and the mean follow-up duration ranged between 3 and 9 years. Replacement was associated with an increased risk of long-term all-cause mortality compared to repair (HR of 1.68, 95% confidence interval 1.35-2.09, p < 0.001, τ2 = 0.03). Surgical era and atrial fibrillation impacted the risk of mortality but not mitral anatomy. Neither repair nor replacement impacted significantly on the risk of re-operation after mitral surgery (HR 1.18, 95% CI 0.85-1.63, p = 0.33, τ2 < 0.01). Mitral valve replacement is possibly associated with higher long-term mortality than mitral valve repair in primary mitral regurgitation but often used as a bailout option in more complex anatomy. Despite this observation, both techniques have similar risk of re-operation.","Overtchouk, P; Ben-Ali, W; Prendergast, B; Conradi, L; Hahn, R; Granada, J; Modine, T",Current cardiology reports,207,6

Although there are many studies proving that a subset of tumors strongly links to the changes of IFITMs, the link between different IFITMs mutant types and diverse tumors has not been studied thoroughly. To investigate the law of expression among IFITMs internal members and the linking of IFITMs mutant types and cancers, online databases were used to pool together relevant data for bioinformatics analysis. Here, we summarize mutations, expression, and functions of human IFITMs, analyze diverse expression levels of IFITMs in physiological and pathological tissues, predict protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, and target miRNAs and relevant signaling pathways of IFITMs. The results show that IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 have similar motif pattern constructions and physiological functions, while IFITM5 and IFITM10 show far diversity from them. Particularly, IFITM1-3, in conjunction with interacting proteins, is strongly related to development and overall survival rates of a portion of cancers, including renal cancer and uveal melanoma (UVM). This trait may make IFITM1-3 become a prognostic marker of cancers.

With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, orthopedic surgery practices nationwide have accelerated adaptation to telemedicine. Telehealth can be effectively applied to total joint arthroplasty, with the ability to perform preoperative consultations, postoperative follow-up, and telerehabilitation in a virtual, remote manner with similar outcomes to in-person visits. New technologies that have emerged, such as virtual goniometers, wearable sensors, and app-based patient questionnaires, have improved clinicians' ability to conduct telehealth visits. Benefits of using telehealth include high patient satisfaction, cost-savings, increased access to care, and more efficiency. Notably, some challenges still exist, including widespread accessibility and adaptation of new technologies, inability to conduct an in-person orthopedic physical examination, and regulatory barriers, such as insurance reimbursement, increased medicolegal risk, and privacy and confidentiality concerns. Despite these hurdles, telehealth is here to stay and can be successfully incorporated in any total joint arthroplasty practice with the appropriate adjustments.","Windsor, Eric N; Sharma, Abhinav K; Gkiatas, Ioannis; Elbuluk, Ameer M; Sculco, Peter K; Vigdorchik, Jonathan M",HSS journal : the musculoskeletal journal of Hospital for Special Surgery,207,1

However, this does not consider demographic changes and temporal trends in mortality. OBJECTIVE To estimate the excess mortality in 2020 in Italy considering demographic changes and temporal trends in mortality. METHODS We used daily mortality and population data for the 2011-2019 period to estimate the expected deaths in 2020. Expected deaths were estimated, separately by sex, through an over-dispersed Poisson regression model including calendar year and age group as covariates, a smooth function of the year's week, and the logarithm of the population as offset. The difference between observed and expected deaths was considered a measure of excess mortality. RESULTS In 2020, 746,146 deaths occurred in Italy. We estimated an excess mortality of 90,725 deaths (95% CI: 86,503-94,914), which became 99,289 deaths after excluding January and February, when mortality was lower than expected. The excess was higher among men (49,422 deaths) than women (41,303 deaths) and it was mostly detected at ages ≥80 (60,224 deaths) and ages 65-79 (25,791 deaths), while among the population aged 25-49 and 50-64 we estimated an excess of 281 and 4764 deaths, respectively. CONCLUSIONS After considering demographic changes and temporal improvement in mortality the excess deaths in 2020 still remains above 90,000 deaths. More important, considering these factors, the excess at ages <80 years is revised upwards, while the excess at older ages is revised downwards.","Alicandro, Gianfranco; LA Vecchia, Carlo; Remuzzi, Giuseppe; Gerli, Alberto; Centanni, Stefano",Panminerva medica,207,1

However, no studies have compared the efficacy of traditional versus mastery learning methods in residency point-of-care ultrasound education. We hypothesized that mastery learning would improve residents' skills in performing the extended focused assessment with sonography in trauma (eFAST). Methods All first-year emergency medicine (EM) resident physicians at a single university hospital underwent a crossover randomized controlled trial to receive mastery-learning eFAST training either at the beginning of the academic year or 6 months into intern year. Participants were taught using a checklist validated by a panel of experts using Mastery Angoff methods and were given feedback on missed tasks until each trainee completed the eFAST with a minimum passing standard (MPS). Our primary outcome was technical proficiency between the two groups for eFAST examinations performed in the emergency department during the academic year. Results Sixteen interns were enrolled; eight were randomized to each group. The group that received mastery training at the beginning of the year had mean clinical eFAST proficiency scores above the MPS in the first two quarters of the academic year, while the control group did not. Once the control group underwent eFAST mastery training at the midpoint of the year, both groups had mean proficiency scores above the MPS for the remainder of the year. Conclusion Simulation-based mastery learning is an effective method of teaching the eFAST examination. This training during intern orientation conferred early proficiency in clinical performance of eFAST among EM residents. This difference in proficiency was no longer present after the control group received mastery learning education halfway through the academic year.","Smith, Siobhan; Lobo, Viveta; Anderson, Kenton L; Gisondi, Michael A; Sebok-Syer, Stefanie S; Duanmu, Youyou",AEM education and training,207,16

In times of the Covid-19 pandemic, safe and effective strategies have to be chosen to minimize hospitalization times and severe courses. In this single-center retrospective analysis, safety and efficacy of cyclophosphamide plus etoposide (CE) and growth-factor support (n = 33) was compared to cyclophosphamide mono treatment and growth-factor support (n = 49) in 82 patients with multiple myeloma at first diagnosis. CE was superior to cyclophosphamide mono with a significantly higher number of collected CD34+ cells (15.46 × 106 CD34+ cells/kg vs. 9.92 × 106 CD34+ cells/kg), significantly faster engraftment of granulocytes after stem cell transplantation (day 10.5 vs. day 11.6), shorter duration of the inpatient stay (17.47 days vs. 19.16 days) and significantly less transfusions (8.82 % vs. 30.61 % patients receiving transfusions).

STUDY DESIGN Single-blinded, randomized, controlled trial. METHODS Subjects were randomized to a control and study group. The control group viewed a video about inflating tracheostomy tube cuffs to safe pressure levels. The study group viewed the same video and also got to palpate the pilot balloons of tracheostomy tube cuffs inflated to three different pressures. All subjects inflated tracheostomy tube cuffs to pressures they believed to be appropriate based on palpation of the pilot balloon preintervention, and immediately, 2 weeks, and 3 months postintervention. RESULTS Forty-nine health care providers participated in the study. There was no significant difference in the mean preintervention cuff inflation pressures between the two groups (36 cm H2 O vs. 38 cm H2 O, P = 0.4888), with both initially overinflating. Postintervention, the study group inflated the cuffs to significantly lower pressures than the control group, closer to the ideal of 25 cm H2 O (26 cm H2 O vs. 35 cm H2 O, P = 0.0001). This difference was also observed 2 weeks (28 cm H2 O vs. 37 cm H2 O P <0.0001) and 3 months (28 cm H2 O vs. 36 cm H2 O, P = 0.0002) postintervention. CONCLUSIONS The novel teaching tool evaluated in this study is simple, easily reproducible, and low-cost.

Among others, a restriction of mobility and a change in the way of carrying out work, going from being face-to-face to non-contact (teleworking). OBJECTIVE to get to know the usual dietary pattern prior to confinement, and to assess the evolution of adherence to the Mediterranean diet weekly until its conclusion. METHODS data were collected using a weekly anonymous online questionnaire that monitored adherence to the Mediterranean diet in real time in an initial sample of 490 adults from Spain. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was assessed using the MEDAS (Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener) and modified PREDIMED questionnaires. RESULTS confinement due to the COVID-19 pandemic influenced the eating habits of the participants, so that adherence to the Mediterranean diet increased at the end of the confinement period, which is of special interest, since it was based on a good initial adherence (MEDAS adherence: 10.03 ± 1.9 initial and 10.47 ± 2.1 final; p = 0.016; modified PREDIMED adherence: 9.26 ± 2.0 initial and 9.89 ± 2.1 final; p < 0.001), without observing clinically relevant changes in body composition as measured by body mass index (BMI) except in women (23.3 kg/m2 ± 2.9 initial and 23.4 kg/m2 ± 2.9 final; p < 0.001), with a slight increase in this parameter, but maintaining on average the healthy values recommended by the guidelines.

Climate change occurs as a result of imbalances between incoming and outgoing radiation in the atmosphere. This process generates heat. As concentrations of atmospheric gases reach record levels, global temperatures are expected to increase significantly. The hydrologic cycle will be altered, since warmer air can retain more moisture than cooler air. This means that some geographic areas will have more rainfall, whereas others have more drought and severe weather. The potential consequences of significant and permanent climatic changes are altered patterns of diseases in animal and human populations, including the emergence of new disease syndromes and changes in the prevalence of existing diseases. A wider geographic distribution of known vectors and the recruitment of new strains to the vector pool could result in infections spreading to more and potentially new species of hosts. If these predictions turn out to be accurate, there will be a need for policymakers to consider alternatives, such as adaptation. This review explores the linkages between climate change and animal diseases, and examines interrelated issues that arise from altered biological dynamics. Its aim is to consider various risks and vulnerabilities and to make the case for policies favoring adaptation.","Cáceres, Sigfrido Burgos",Animal health research reviews,207,1

We compared the accuracy of PtcCO2 with that of PaCO2 measurements in critically ill children, and we investigated whether clinical conditions associated with low cardiac output or increased subcutaneous tissue affect this accuracy. METHODS We performed a single-center prospective study of critically ill children placed on transcutaneous monitoring. RESULTS There were 184 children enrolled with paired PaCO2 and PtcCO2 values. Subjects had a median age of 31.8 mo (interquartile range 3.5-123.3 mo). Most children were mechanically ventilated (n = 161, 87.5%), and many had cardiac disease (n = 76, 41.3%). The median PaCO2 was 44 mm Hg (interquartile range 39-51 mm Hg). The mean bias between PaCO2 and PtcCO2 was 0.6 mm Hg with 95% limits of agreement from -13.6 to 14.7 mm Hg. The PtcCO2 and PaCO2 were within ±5 mm Hg in 126 (68.5%) measurements. In multivariable modeling, cyanotic heart disease (odds ratio 3.5, 95% CI 1.2-10, P = .02) and monitor number 2 (odds ratio 3.8 95% CI 1.3-10.5, P = .01) remained associated with PtcCO2 ≥ 5 mm Hg higher than PaCO2 . Serum lactate, fluid balance, renal failure, obesity, vasoactive-inotrope score, and acyanotic heart disease were not associated with high or low PtcCO2 values. In 130 children with a second paired PtcCO2 and PaCO2 measurement, predicting the second measured PaCO2 by subtracting the initial observed difference between the PtcCO2 and PaCO2 from the subsequent measured PtcCO2 decreased the mean bias between observed and predicted PaCO2 to 0.2 mm Hg and the 95% limits of agreement to -9.4 to 9.7 mm Hg. CONCLUSIONS PtcCO2 provides an acceptable estimate of PaCO2 in many critically ill children, including those with clinical conditions that may be associated with low cardiac output or increased subcutaneous tissue, although it does not perform as well in children with cyanotic heart disease. PtcCO2 may be a useful adjunct monitoring method, but it cannot reliably replace PaCO2 measurement.","Bhalla, Anoopindar K; Khemani, Robinder G; Hotz, Justin C; Morzov, Rica P; Newth, Christopher Jl",Respiratory care,207,27

The eligibility criteria were defined based on the elements of population, context, and concept, without restrictions on the period, language, and type of publication. Twenty-four papers were included, from 1997 to 2020, totalling 29 tests/instruments for the assessment of the tactical domain, with the majority of studies having an European sample. Twelve terms were used to nominate the tactical component, regardless of the assessment method and approach. Six tests met eight or nine criteria in the critical appraisal: TCTOF, TACSIS Spanish version, Semi-Structured Interview, TCTP-OE, GPET, and FUTSAT. Thus, it is concluded that studies and tests for the assessment of the tactical domain of young soccer players are recent and mainly European; there is no consensus about the adopted terminology; and few tests met the majority of the quality criteria. Therefore, we suggest: a) the construction/adaptation of tests with samples from other continents; b) the use of the proposed criteria; and c) that the terms tactical knowledge and tactical performance are adopted.","Rechenchosky, Leandro; Menegassi, Vanessa Menezes; Jaime, Matheus de Oliveira; Borges, Paulo Henrique; Sarmento, Hugo; Mancha-Triguero, David; Serra-Olivares, Jaime; Rinaldi, Wilson",Journal of sports sciences,207,1

Unlike nucleic acids, proteins cannot be amplified, making detection of minute quantities from single cells difficult. Here, we develop a strategy to detect targeted protein and its PTM isoforms in single cells. We barcode the proteins from single cells by tagging them with oligonucleotides, pool barcoded cells together, run bulk gel electrophoresis to separate protein and its PTM isoform and quantify their abundances by sequencing the oligonucleotides associated with each protein species. We used this strategy, iDentification and qUantification sEparaTion (DUET), to measure histone protein H2B and its monoubiquitination isoform, H2Bub, in single yeast cells. Our results revealed the heterogeneities of H2B ubiquitination levels in single cells from different cell-cycle stages, which is obscured in ensemble measurements.","Zhang, Yandong; Sohn, Changho; Lee, Seoyoen; Ahn, Heejeong; Seo, Jinyoung; Cao, Junyue; Cai, Long",Communications biology,207,1

Six reviewers conducted a comprehensive search of four literature databases using terms that pertained to a caregiver and trust to investigate the role trust plays when caregivers use HIT. While trust is a key factor for the use of HIT, it the researchers only identified ten articles that met the research question thresholds. Four main topics of trust surfaced including perceived confidentiality, perceived security, technological malfunction, and trustworthiness of the information. Trust is a critical factor for informal caregivers when using HIT to assist in the care of their patient (child, loved one, parent, or acquaintance). Based on the findings, it is clear that more research on the use of HIT by caregivers is needed.","Noblin, Alice; Hewitt, Barbara; Moqbel, Murad; Sittig, Scott; Kinnerson, Lakesha; Rulon, Vera",Informatics for health & social care,207,16

We describe how the narrative of war has further dented social cohesion, an important social determinant of health, and created a rift in the healthcare system at a time of immense crisis. We express concern that such systemic instability threatens to drive a deeper wedge into the already precarious physician-patient relationship, while also putting the future of medicine at stake.

The aim of this study is to figure out the benefits of transumbilical single-port laparoscopic appendectomy (TULA) compared with conventional three-port laparoscopic appendectomy (CTLA). METHODS From 2010 to 2012, 89 patients who were diagnosed as acute appendicitis and then underwent laparoscopic appendectomy a single surgeon were enrolled in this study and with their medical records were reviewed retrospectively. Cases of complicated appendicitis confirmed on imaging tools and patients over 3 points on the American Society of Anesthesia score were excluded. RESULTS Among the total of 89 patients, there were 51 patients in the TULA group and 38 patients in the CTLA group. The visual analogue scale (VAS) of postoperative day (POD) #1 was higher in the TULA group than in the CTLA group (P = 0.048). The operative time and other variables had no statistical significances (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION Despite the insufficiency of instruments and the difficulty of handling, TULA was not worse in operative time, VAS after POD #2, and the total operative cost than CTLA. And, if there are no disadvantages of TULA, TULA may be suitable in substituting three-port laparoscopic surgery and could be considered as one field of natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery with the improvement and development of the instruments and revised studies.","Baik, Seung Min; Hong, Kyung Sook; Kim, Yong Il",Journal of the Korean Surgical Society,207,19

One of these is the need to (re)assess the occupational risks, particularly, biological risks. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this work is to promote guidance to occupational safety and health practitioners when conducting a biological risk assessment in this context. METHODS The main steps of the biological risk assessment are explained with some inputs regarding the novelty posed by SARS-CoV-2 and an example of a qualitative risk assessment method is presented. Also, its application to two different activities was exemplified. RESULTS In both cases, the assessment considered that vulnerable workers were working from home or in medical leave. The results showed low or medium risk level for the assessed tasks. For medium risk level, additional controls are advised, such maintain social distancing, sanitize instruments/equipment before use, use proper and well-maintained PPE (when applicable), and promote awareness sessions to spread good practices at work. Employers must be aware of their obligations regarding biological risk assessment and OSH practitioners must be prepared to screen and link the abundance of scientific evidence generated following the outbreak, with the technical practice. CONCLUSIONS This paper could be an important contribution to OSH practice since it highlights the need to (re)assess occupational risks, especially biological risk, to ensure a safe return to work, providing technical guidance.","Carvalhais, Carlos; Querido, Micaela; Pereira, Cristiana C; Santos, Joana",Work,207,16

Our objective was to compare the pharmacokinetics of these 2 tracers in healthy volunteers. METHODS (99m)Tc(CO)(3)(NTA) was prepared with commercially available NTA and a commercially available kit and isolated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Approximately 74 MBq (2 mCi) of (99m)Tc(CO)(3)(NTA) were coinjected with 9.25 MBq (250 microCi) of (131)I-OIH in 9 volunteers, and simultaneous imaging of each tracer was performed for 24 min. Plasma clearances were determined from 8 blood samples obtained 3-90 min after injection using the single-injection, 2-compartment model. Plasma protein binding, red cell uptake, and percentage injected dose in the urine at 30 and 180 min were determined. RESULTS There was no difference in the plasma clearances of (99m)Tc(CO)(3)(NTA) and (131)I-OIH, 475 +/- 105 mL/min versus 472 +/- 108 mL/min, respectively. The plasma protein binding and red cell uptake of (99m)Tc(CO)(3)(NTA) were 43% +/- 5% and 9% +/- 6%, respectively; both values were significantly lower (P < 0.001) than the plasma protein binding (75% +/- 3%) and red cell uptake (17% +/- 5%) of (131)I-OIH. There was no significant difference in the percentage injected dose recovered in the urine at 30 min and at 3 h; for comparison, the percentage dose in the urine at 3 h was 91% +/- 4% for (99m)Tc(CO)(3)(NTA) and 91% +/- 6% for (131)I-OIH (P = 0.96). Image quality with (99m)Tc(CO)(3)(NTA) was excellent, and the renogram parameters were similar to those of (131)I-OIH.

For intravenous infusion-related errors, ""smart infusion devices"" incorporating dose error reduction software are widely advocated. Our aim was to explore the role of smart infusion devices in preventing or contributing to medication administration errors using retrospective review of 2 complementary data sets that collectively included a wide range of errors with different levels of actual or potential harm. METHODS We reviewed 216 medication administration errors identified from an observational study in clinical practice and 123 medication incidents involving infusion devices reported to a national reporting system. The impact of smart infusion devices in preventing or contributing to these errors was assessed by the research team and an expert panel. RESULTS The data suggest that use of any infusion device rather than gravitational administration may have prevented 13% of observed errors and 8% of reported incidents; additional reductions may be possible with standalone smart infusion devices, and further potential reductions with smart infusion devices integrated with electronic prescribing and barcode administration systems. An estimated 52% to 73% of errors that occurred with traditional infusion pumps could be prevented with such integrated smart infusion devices. In the few cases where smart infusion devices were used, these contributed to errors in 2 of 58 observed errors and 7 of 8 reported incidents. CONCLUSIONS Smart infusion devices not only prevent some medication administration errors but can also contribute to them. Further evaluation of such systems is required to make recommendations for policy and practice.","Jani, Yogini H; Chumbley, Gillian M; Furniss, Dominic; Blandford, Ann; Franklin, Bryony",Journal of patient safety,207,7

In this paper we highlight the potentially disastrous consequences of naïve shared ventilation, in which patients are simply connected in parallel to a ventilator without any regard to their individual ventilatory requirements. We then examine possible approaches for individualization of mechanical ventilation, using modifications to the breathing circuit that may enable tuning of individual tidal volumes and driving pressures during either volume-controlled ventilation (VCV) or pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV). METHODS Breathing circuit modifications included a PEEP valve on each expiratory limb for both VCV and PCV, an adjustable constriction and one-way valve on the inspiratory limb for VCV, and a pressure relief valve for peak-inspiratory pressure reduction on the inspiratory limb for PCV. The ability to regulate individual tidal volumes using these breathing circuit modifications was tested both theoretically in computer simulations as well as experimentally in mechanical test lungs. RESULTS In both the simulations and experimental measurements, naïve shared ventilation resulted in large imbalances across individual tidal volume delivery, dependent on imbalances across patient mechanical properties. The proposed breathing circuit modifications for shared VCV and shared PCV enabled optimization of tidal volume distributions. Individual tidal volume for one patient during shared VCV was sensitive to changes in the mechanical properties of other patients. By contrast, shared PCV enabled independent control of individual patient received ventilation. CONCLUSIONS Of the shared ventilation strategies considered, shared PCV, with the inclusion of in-line pressure relief valves in the individual inspiratory and expiratory limbs, offers the greatest degree of safety and lowest risk of catastrophic mechanical interactions between multiple patients connected to a single ventilator.","Herrmann, Jacob; Fonseca da Cruz, Andrea; Hawley, Monica L; Branson, Richard D; Kaczka, David W",Respiratory care,207,1

Oral sucrose is frequently given to relieve procedural pain in neonates on the basis of its effect on behavioural and physiological pain scores. We assessed whether sucrose administration reduces pain-specific brain and spinal cord activity after an acute noxious procedure in newborn infants. METHODS In this double-blind, randomised controlled trial, 59 newborn infants at University College Hospital (London, UK) were randomly assigned to receive 0·5 mL 24% sucrose solution or 0·5 mL sterile water 2 min before undergoing a clinically required heel lance. Randomisation was by a computer-generated randomisation code, and researchers, clinicians, participants, and parents were masked to the identity of the solutions. The primary outcome was pain-specific brain activity evoked by one time-locked heel lance, recorded with electroencephalography and identified by principal component analysis. Secondary measures were baseline behavioural and physiological measures, observational pain scores (PIPP), and spinal nociceptive reflex withdrawal activity. Data were analysed per protocol. This study is registered, number ISRCTN78390996. FINDINGS 29 infants were assigned to receive sucrose and 30 to sterilised water; 20 and 24 infants, respectively, were included in the analysis of the primary outcome measure. Nociceptive brain activity after the noxious heel lance did not differ significantly between infants who received sucrose and those who received sterile water (sucrose: mean 0·10, 95% CI 0·04-0·16; sterile water: mean 0·08, 0·04-0·12; p=0·46). No significant difference was recorded between the sucrose and sterile water groups in the magnitude or latency of the spinal nociceptive reflex withdrawal recorded from the biceps femoris of the stimulated leg. The PIPP score was significantly lower in infants given sucrose than in those given sterile water (mean 5·8, 95% CI 3·7-7·8 vs 8·5, 7·3-9·8; p=0·02) and significantly more infants had no change in facial expression after sucrose administration (seven of 20 [35%] vs none of 24; p<0·0001). INTERPRETATION Our data suggest that oral sucrose does not significantly affect activity in neonatal brain or spinal cord nociceptive circuits, and therefore might not be an effective analgesic drug. The ability of sucrose to reduce clinical observational scores after noxious events in newborn infants should not be interpreted as pain relief.

ADHD is associated with an increased risk of seizures and, in this context, concerns have been expressed that stimulant drugs, including MPH, may increase the seizure risk. However, 4 large observational studies have found that ADHD drugs in general and stimulant drugs in particular are not associated with increased seizure risk and may, in fact, be associated with a reduced risk of seizures; these studies were largely conducted in children and adolescents, including those with epilepsy, with or without other brain comorbidities. The findings were obtained in both between-subjects and within-subjects analyses; the latter controlled for time-invariant inadequately measured, unmeasured, and unknown confounds. These reassuring results support the results of many small, short-duration trials that found that MPH was not associated with increased seizure risk. One other observational study however found that MPH was indeed associated with an increased risk of seizures, but only during the first 30 days after drug initiation; there was no increase in risk in earlier or later time windows. There are many reasons why this single finding should be viewed with reservation; in any case, even if the finding is valid, the absolute risk of seizures with MPH appears to be very low. It is therefore reasonable to conclude that MPH may be safely used in children and adolescents, even those with a current or past history of epilepsy; however, prudence dictates that attention be paid to potential seizure triggers during the first month of treatment. This risk needs to be specifically reexamined in future research.","Andrade, Chittaranjan",The Journal of clinical psychiatry,207,24

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess and quantify the value of in-hospital systems-based interventions in streamlining reperfusion therapy delivery following AIS. MATERIAL & METHODS Articles from the following databases were retrieved: Medline, Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. The primary endpoint was in-hospital time metrics between the intervention and control group. The secondary endpoint included the rate of good functional outcome at 90 days. RESULTS 393 Systems intervention studies published after 2015 were screened, and 231 full articles were then read. In total, 35 studies with 35,815 patients were included in the final systematic review and 26 studies with 7,089 patients were used in the meta-analysis. The greatest time reductions from in-hospital system interventions were achieved in door-to-needle (DTN) time (SMD: -2.696, 95% CI: -2.976, -2.416, z = 3.03, p = 0.002). Systems interventions were also associated with a statistically significant improvement in mortality (RR: 0.25, 95% CI: 0.18, 0.38), rate of symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage (RR: 0.07, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.1) and ≤60-minute reperfusion rates (RR: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.51, 0.79). CONCLUSIONS The use of in-hospital workflow optimization is imperative to expedite reperfusion therapy delivery and improving patient outcomes. To reduce the morbidity and mortality of stroke globally, in-hospital workflow guidelines should be adhered to and incorporated including the optimal elements identified in this study.","Baskar, Prithvi Santana; Chowdhury, Seemub Zaman; Bhaskar, Sonu Menachem Maimonides",Acta neurologica Scandinavica,207,31

Schools worldwide have been forced to close due to illness and absenteeism, transmission and risk to vulnerable members of the school community, and community concerns. The decision to reopen school during a pandemic will have a tremendous impact on children's safety, growth, and well-being. Not opening invites social isolation and suboptimal educational experiences, especially for youth whose computing assets and online access are limited and those with special needs. The opening has hazards as well, and the mitigation of these risks is the topic of this chapter. Opening schools requires careful considerations of benefits, risks, and precautions. Guiding principles for safety and strategic application of the principles in each educational niche are critical issues to consider during school reopening. The fundamental principles of disease control involve school-directed initiatives (physical distancing and mask use, hand/face and surface cleansing, administrative controls, engineering controls) and individual-level risk reduction approaches to maximize adherence to new guidelines. The school-initiated ""top-down"" approaches and the individual-level ""bottom-up"" approaches must be synergized, as no single method will ensure safety. We discuss how to effectively layer strategies in each educational space to increase safety. Since the vulnerability of children has been heightened during this pandemic crisis, we highlight the special considerations for mental health support that should be considered by schools. The safety principles, disease control strategies, and other critical issues discussed here will serve as a starting point for developing a safe, comprehensive, and feasible reopening plan.","Li, Dan; Lin, Elizabeth Z; Brault, Marie A; Paquette, Julie; Vermund, Sten H; Godri Pollitt, Krystal J",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,207,1

METHODS Nine women between 51 and 59 years old with climacteric syndrome in menopause or perimenopause were included. Patients with hormone replacement therapy, psychiatric treatment with antidepressants, or acupuncture treatment in the last 3 months were excluded. A 4 Hz EA treatment was performed at acupoints Shenshu (BL-23), Pishu (BL-20), Guanyuan (REN-4), Taixi (KID-3), Fuliu (KID-7), Sanyinjiao (SP-6) and Neiguan (P-6) points. Women were treated two times a week for five consecutive weeks for a total treatment of 10 sessions. The menopause rating scale (MRS) was used to evaluate symptoms reduction and CGRP gene expression was measured before and after 10 EA session. RESULTS The results shown that climacteric symptoms diminish significantly after EA therapy. CGRP gene expression was down-regulated, evidencing a decrease of 5-fold after EA therapy respect to the initial condition. CONCLUSION EA treatment was associated with improvement in patients with climacteric syndrome and may be related to modulation of CGRP levels.","Pinzón-Galvis, Camilo Alberto; Román-García, Karina; Rosas-Martínez, María Isabel; Becerril-Chávez, Flavia; Medel-Flores, Olivia; Sánchez-Monroy, Virginia",Explore,207,1

However, improper and unregulated disposals of these DPFs has been and will continue to intensify the plastic pollution problem we are already facing. This study focuses on the emission of pollutants from 7 DPF brands that were submerged in water to simulate environmental conditions if these DPFs were littered. The DPF leachates were filtered by inorganic membranes, and both particle-deposited organic membranes and the filtrates were characterized using techniques such as FTIR, SEM-EDX, Light Microscopy, ICP-MS and LC-MS. Micro and nano scale polymeric fibres, particles, siliceous fragments and leachable inorganic and organic chemicals were observed from all of the tested DPFs. Traces of concerning heavy metals (i.e. lead up to 6.79 µg/L) were detected in association with silicon containing fragments. ICP-MS also confirmed the presence of other leachable metals like cadmium (up to 1.92 µg/L), antimony (up to 393 µg/L) and copper (up to 4.17 µg/L). LC-MS analysis identified polar leachable organic species related to plastic additives and contaminants; polyamide-66 monomer and oligomers (nylon-66 synthesis), surfactant molecules, dye-like molecules and polyethylene glycol were all tentatively identified in the leachate. The toxicity of some of the chemicals found and the postulated risks of the rest of the present particles and molecules, raises the question of whether DPFs are safe to be used on a daily basis and what consequences are to be expected after their disposal into the environment.","Sullivan, G L; Delgado-Gallardo, J; Watson, T M; Sarp, S",Water research,207,31

We consider virtual device deployment and hemodynamics as well as thrombus formation, with the scope to assess pre-operatively the efficacy of specific devices in treating particular aneurysms. An algorithm based on a linear and torsional spring analogy is developed for the fast virtual deployment of stents and similar minimally invasive devices in patient-specific vessel geometries. The virtual deployment algorithm is used to accurately deploy a total of four stent designs in three aneurysm geometries. A variety of different flow-diverting stent designs, representing the commercially available and the entirely novel, are presented, varying in both mesh design and porosity. Transient computational hemodynamics simulations are performed on multiple patient-specific geometries to predict the reduction in aneurysm inflow after the deployment of each device. Further, a thrombosis initiation and growth model is implemented, coupled with the hemodynamic computations. Hemodynamic simulations show large variations in flow reduction between devices and across different aneurysm geometries. The industry standard of flow-diverters with 70% porosity, assumed to offer the best compromise in flexibility and flow reduction, is challenged in at least one aneurysm geometry.","Peach, T W; Ngoepe, M; Spranger, K; Zajarias-Fainsod, D; Ventikos, Y",International journal for numerical methods in biomedical engineering,207,1

The pain could be explained by the anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome (ACNES). However, the incidence of ACNES after laparoscopic bariatric surgery is unclear. We report the cases of two patients with unexplained abdominal pain after laparoscopic bariatric surgery and a significant delay in the diagnosis of ACNES. In both cases, clinical signs of ACNES were demonstrated by a centralized trigger point in the abdominal wall and specific neuropathic aspects during examination. Both patients were temporary pain-free after a diagnostic local lidocaine injection. A neurectomy was performed in both cases, after which they remained pain-free. There was a significant delay (six months and three years, respectively) in the diagnosis of ACNES, and many additional imaging procedures including a diagnostic laparoscopy were performed. ACNES is difficult to diagnose due to its relatively unknown entity. This case report confirms that the diagnosis of ACNES is still frequently overlooked as a cause of chronic abdominal pain. Earlier diagnosis recognition can probably prevent unnecessary investigations and may improve the quality of life in bariatric patients with unexplained abdominal pain.","Smelt, Hendrika; Pouwels, Sjaak; Apers, J A; Said, Mohammed; Smulders, Johannes",Cureus,207,1

An automatic construction method was used that considered explanation adequacy and inference accuracy. In addition, we evaluated the usefulness of prior experts' (radiologists') knowledge while constructing the models. In total, 179 patients with lung nodules were included and divided into 79 and 100 cases for training and test data, respectively. F-measure and accuracy were used to assess explanation adequacy and inference accuracy, respectively. For F-measure, reasons were defined as proper subsets of Evidence that had a strong influence on the inference result. The inference models were automatically constructed using the Bayesian network and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, selecting only those models that met the predefined criteria. During model constructions, we examined the effect of including radiologist's knowledge in the initial Bayesian network models. Performance of the best models in terms of F-measure, accuracy, and evaluation metric were as follows: 0.411, 72.0%, and 0.566, respectively, with prior knowledge, and 0.274, 65.0%, and 0.462, respectively, without prior knowledge. The best models with prior knowledge were then subjectively and independently evaluated by two radiologists using a 5-point scale, with 5, 3, and 1 representing beneficial, appropriate, and detrimental, respectively. The average scores by the two radiologists were 3.97 and 3.76 for the test data, indicating that the proposed computer-aided diagnosis system was acceptable to them. In conclusion, the proposed method incorporating radiologists' knowledge could help in eliminating radiologists' distrust of computer-aided diagnosis and improving its performance.","Kawagishi, Masami; Kubo, Takeshi; Sakamoto, Ryo; Yakami, Masahiro; Fujimoto, Koji; Aoyama, Gakuto; Emoto, Yutaka; Sekiguchi, Hiroyuki; Sakai, Koji; Iizuka, Yoshio; Nishio, Mizuho; Yamamoto, Hiroyuki; Togashi, Kaori",PloS one,207,1

The accessibility of lung epithelium to inhaled therapies makes it possible to stimulate local antimicrobial defences with aerosolized innate immune ligands. This strategy has been shown to be effective in preclinical models, as delivery of innate immune ligands to the lungs of laboratory animals results in protection from subsequent challenge with microbial pathogens. Survival of the animal host in this setting correlates directly with killing of pathogens within the lungs, indicating the induction of a resistance mechanism. Resistance appears to be mediated primarily by activated epithelial cells rather than recruited leucocytes. Resistance reaches a peak within hours and persists for several days. Innate immune ligands can interact synergistically under some circumstances, and synergistic combinations of innate ligands delivered by aerosol are capable of inducing a high level of broad host resistance to bacteria, fungi and viruses. The induction of innate antimicrobial resistance within the lungs could have clinical applications in the prevention of lower respiratory tract infection in subjects transiently at high risk. These include cancer patients undergoing myeloablative chemotherapy, intubated patients being mechanically ventilated, vulnerable individuals during seasonal influenza epidemics, asthmatic subjects experiencing a respiratory viral infection, and healthy subjects exposed to virulent pathogens from a bioterror attack or emergent pandemic. In summary, stimulation of the lung epithelium to induce localized resistance to infection is a novel strategy whose clinical utility will be assessed in the near future.","Evans, Scott E; Tuvim, Michael J; Fox, Cory J; Sachdev, Nidhi; Gibiansky, Leonid; Dickey, Burton F",British journal of pharmacology,207,1

This presents a concern because physical inactivity can lead to obesity and a host of comorbidities. This qualitative study explores hair experiences of black adolescent girls and how they maintain their cultural hair practices in hopes of promoting PA among this at-risk population. METHODS Focus groups were conducted for 37 black adolescent girls attending a public high school in Newark, New Jersey. RESULTS The participants reported increasing hair knowledge via social media, sociocultural influences of family and culture, and the driving force of their peer group, a concept identified in the focus groups as Hair IQ (intelligence quotient).

In recent years, the Full Matrix Capture (FMC) technique has been implemented to extract the signals for post-processing to form an image. The inherent anisotropy and the layering of the structure pose challenges for the interpretation of this FMC data. To overcome this challenge, modeling techniques are required that take into account the diffraction caused by finite-size transducers and the response of the structure to these bounded beams. Existing models either homogenize the entire structure, use computationally expensive finite difference time domain (FDTD) methods, or do not consider the shape of the bounded beam, which is used to test such structures. This paper proposes a modeling technique based on combining the Multi-Gaussian beam model with the recursive stiffness matrix method to simulate the FMC signals for layered anisotropic media. The paper provides the steps required for the modeling technique, the extraction of the system efficiency factor, and validation of the model with experimentally determined signals for aluminum as an isotropic material such as aluminum and Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic (CFRP) laminate as a layered material. The proposed method is computationally inexpensive, shows good agreement with the experimentally determined FMC data, and enables us to understand the effects of various transducer and material parameters on the extracted FMC signals.","Anand, Chirag; Groves, Roger; Benedictus, Rinze",Sensors,207,31

Our aims were to determine (1) if novices can be trained to a basic proficiency level of lung isolation skills, (2) whether video-didactic and simulation-based trainings are comparable in teaching lung isolation basic skills, and (3) whether novice learners' lung isolation skills decay over time without practice. METHODS First, five board certified anesthesiologist with experience of more than 100 successful lung isolations were tested on Human Airway Anatomy Simulator (HAAS) to establish Expert proficiency skill level. Thirty senior medical students, who were naive to bronchoscopy and lung isolation techniques (Novice) were randomized to video-didactic and simulation-based trainings to learn lung isolation skills. Before and after training, Novices' performances were scored for correct placement using pass/fail scoring and a 5-point Global Rating Scale (GRS); and time of insertion was recorded. Fourteen novices were retested 2 months later to assess skill decay. RESULTS Experts' and novices' double lumen endobronchial tube and bronchial blocker passing rates showed similar success rates after training (P >0.99).

Methods Samples from sick (n = 96) and dead ( n = 15) cats were analysed using reverse transcription PCR. Blood and urine analyses and histopathology were also performed. Results FmoPV RNA was detected in six cats (5.4%), including three sick (in the urine) and three dead cats (tissues). A significantly greater proportion of FmoPV RNA-positive cats had street access compared with non-infected cats. Blood samples from the morbillivirus-positive cats were negative for morbillivirus RNA. Tubular parenchymal cells, lymphoid and plasma cells in kidney and hepatocytes, lymphoid and plasma cells in liver from dead cats were also positive by immunohistochemistry for the viral N protein. Two FmoPV-positive cats were also positive for feline coronavirus RNA and one cat for feline immunodeficiency virus RNA and feline leukaemia virus proviral DNA. Phylogenetic analysis of the six FmoPV-positive cats showed that the strains were grouped into cluster D and had high similarity (98.5-100%) with strains from Japan and Germany. In the three FmoPV RNA-positive sick cats, respiratory, urinary and digestive system signs were observed as well as weight loss, fever and depression in some cats. Similar clinical signs were also seen in the morbillivirus RNA-negative sick cats. FmoPV RNA-positive cats had lower median red blood cell count, haemoglobin, albumin, albumin/globulin and urobilinogen and higher alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin compared with non-infected cats. Significant histopathology of FmoPV RNA-positive dead cats included tubulointerstitial nephritis characterised by severe granular and vacuolar degeneration of the epithelial cells of the cortical and medullary tubules as well as mononuclear cell infiltrates. Widespread lymphoid cell infiltrates were detected in the renal cortex and medullary regions of the kidneys. Cellular infiltration, cholangiohepatitis and focal necrosis in the liver were also found. Although virus-infected cells were found in the kidney and liver of FmoRV RNA-positive cats, tubulointerstitial nephritis, cholangiohepatitis and focal necrosis seen in FmoRV RNA-positive cats were similar to those observed in FmoRV RNA-negative cats. Conclusions and relevance This is the first study to show the presence of FmoPV infection in cats in Turkey. Sick cats, particularly those with kidney disease, should be tested for this virus. The genotypes found in this study were similar to previously reported strains, indicating that circulating morbilliviruses in Turkey are conserved.","Yilmaz, Huseyin; Tekelioglu, Bilge K; Gurel, Aydin; Bamac, Ozge E; Ozturk, Gulay Y; Cizmecigil, Utku Y; Altan, Eda; Aydin, Ozge; Yilmaz, Aysun; Berriatua, Eduardo; Helps, Chris R; Richt, Juergen A; Turan, Nuri",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,207,31

The bacterium Brucella abortus generates a host endoplasmic reticulum-derived vacuole (rBCV) that supports its intracellular growth, via VirB Type IV secretion system-mediated delivery of effector proteins, whose functions and mode of action are mostly unknown. Here, we show that the effector BspF specifically promotes Brucella replication within rBCVs by interfering with vesicular transport between the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and recycling endocytic compartment. BspF targeted the recycling endosome, inhibited retrograde traffic to the TGN, and interacted with the Arf6 GTPase-activating Protein (GAP) ACAP1 to dysregulate Arf6-/Rab8a-dependent transport within the recycling endosome, which resulted in accretion of TGN-associated vesicles by rBCVs and enhanced bacterial growth. Altogether, these findings provide mechanistic insight into bacterial modulation of membrane transport used to promote their own proliferation within intracellular vacuoles.","Borghesan, Elizabeth; Smith, Erin P; Myeni, Sebenzile; Binder, Kelsey; Knodler, Leigh A; Celli, Jean",The EMBO journal,207,29

We therefore tested and compared the efficiency of 16 different brands of Ca(OH)2 based CO2 absorbents used as loose fill or a cartridge in a refillable canister under identical low flow conditions. CO2 absorbents efficiency was tested by flowing 160 mL/min CO2 into the tip of a 2 L balloon that was ventilated with an ADU anesthesia machine (GE, Madison, WI, USA) with a tidal volume of 500 mL and a respiratory rate of 10/min while running an O2/air FGF of 300 mL/min. After the 1020 mL refillable container was filled with a known volume of CO2 absorbent (derived from weighing the initial canister content and the product's density), the time for the inspired CO2 concentration (FICO2) to rise to 0.5% was measured. This test was repeated 4 times for each product. Because the two SpiraLith Ca® products (one with and one without indicator) are delivered as a cartridge, they had to be tested using their proprietary canister. The time (min) for FICO2 to reach 0.5% was normalized to 100 mL of product, and defined as the efficiency, which was compared amongst the different brands using ANOVA. Efficiency ranged from 50 to 100 min per 100 mL of product, and increased with increasing NaOH content (a catalyst), the exception being SpiraLith Ca® cartridge with color indicator (performing as well as the most efficient granular products) and the SpiraLith Ca® cartridge without color indicator (outperforming all others). Results indicated a spherical or bullet shape is less efficient in absorbing CO2 than broken fragments or cylinders, which in turn is less efficient than a hemispherical (disc) shape, which is in turn less efficient than a solid cartridge with a molded channel geometry. The efficiency of Ca(OH)2 based CO2 absorbent differs up to 100% on a volume basis. Macroscopic arrangement (cylindrical wrap with preformed channels versus granules), chemical composition (NaOH content), and granular shape all affect efficiency per volume of product.

The present study, informed by the pathogen-prevalence hypothesis, tested the influence of individualism and collectivism on xenophobic response to the threat of Ebola. A nationally representative sample of 1,000 Americans completed a survey, indicating their perceptions of their vulnerability to Ebola, ability to protect themselves from Ebola (protection efficacy), and xenophobic tendencies. Overall, the more vulnerable people felt, the more they exhibited xenophobic responses, but this relationship was moderated by individualism and collectivism. The increase in xenophobia associated with increased vulnerability was especially pronounced among people with high individualism scores and those with low collectivism scores. These relationships were mediated by protection efficacy. State-level collectivism had the same moderating effect on the association between perceived vulnerability and xenophobia that individual-level value orientation did. Collectivism-and the set of practices and rituals associated with collectivistic cultures-may serve as psychological protection against the threat of disease.","Kim, Heejung S; Sherman, David K; Updegraff, John A",Psychological science,207,7

A multicenter ambispective analysis was performed in nine centers in Spain during a 4-month period. Data were collected from every patient, including changes in treatments, referrals or delays in surgeries, changes in surgical approaches, postoperative outcomes and perioperative SARS-CoV-2 status. The hospital's response to the outbreak and available resources were categorized, and outcomes were divided into periods based on the timeline of the pandemic. A total of 301 patients were included by the study centers and 259 (86%) underwent surgery. Five hospitals went into phase III during the peak of incidence period, one remained in phase II and three in phase I. More than 60% of patients suffered some form of change: 48% referrals, 39% delays, 4% of rectal cancer patients had a prolonged interval to surgery and 5% underwent neoadjuvant treatment. At the time of study closure, 3% did not undergo surgery. More than 85% of the patients were tested preoperatively for SARS-CoV-2. A total of 9 patients (3%) developed postoperative pneumonia, three of them had confirmed SARS-CoV-2. The observed surgical complications and mortality rates were similar as expected in a usual situation. The present multicenter study shows different patterns of response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and collateral effects in managing CRC patients. Knowing these patterns could be useful for planning future changes in surgical departments in preparation for new outbreaks.","Tejedor, Patricia; Simó, Vicente; Arredondo, Jorge; López-Rojo, Irene; Baixauli, Jorge; Jiménez, Luis Miguel; Gómez-Ruiz, Marcos; Pastor, Carlos",Revista espanola de enfermedades digestivas : organo oficial de la Sociedad Espanola de Patologia Digestiva,207,8

Capnography frequently detects hypoventilation and apnea among children recovering from anesthesia. Although children are routinely monitored with capnography during anesthesia, reducing the rate of adverse events, it is not routinely used in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), where patients remain at risk for respiratory depression. AIM We hypothesized that children monitored with capnography would have more frequent staff interventions and fewer adverse events than children monitored with pulse oximetry alone. METHODS Otherwise healthy children of age 1-20 years undergoing general anesthesia for elective surgery were eligible for enrollment upon entering the pediatric PACU. Subjects were randomized as to whether PACU staff could view the capnography monitor (intervention group) or not (control group). All children received standard monitoring with pulse oximetry. Vital signs and patient interventions were recorded every 30 s by a portable monitor or a research associate. RESULTS Data from 201 children were analyzed. The rates of hypopneic hypoventilation [5% (95% CI: 2-8%) per minute vs 1% (95% CI: -1% to 3%) per minute, difference 4% (95% CI: 0.2-8%) per minute; P = 0.04] and apnea [11% (95% CI: 8-14%) per minute vs 1.5% (95% CI: -2% to 5%) per minute, difference 9% (5-14%) per minute; P < 0.001] decreased significantly faster in our intervention group as compared to the control group. The rates of bradypnea decreased faster in our control group [5% (95% CI: 2-8%) per minute vs 1% (95% CI: 0-4%) per minute, difference 4% per minute, 95% CI: 0-9%; P = 0.05]. Rates of respiratory events over time between groups were affected by the presence or absence of interventions. There were no differences in rates of hypoxemia between groups over time. CONCLUSIONS Children monitored with capnography have different rates of adverse respiratory events over time than children monitored solely with pulse oximetry. The addition of capnography improved the efficacy of staff interventions, however did not impact rates of oxygen desaturation.","Langhan, Melissa L; Li, Fang-Yong; Lichtor, J Lance",Paediatric anaesthesia,207,1

The goal was to provide animals with selected microbiota compatible with sustained health. Sixty years later, SPF status has become a variable itself in biomedical research. Alterations in the gut microbiome-host relationship can profoundly influence basic physiology, immune/inflammatory function, susceptibility to infection and disease, and behavior. In addition, it can influence the translational success of a drug or technology from animal models to humans. We discuss this aspect of SPF status in animal models used for military or civilian trauma and shock research. Currently, there is a broad spectrum of SPF exclusion and inclusion criteria which vary from one supplier or animal husbandry facility. If translation to humans is the end-game of trauma research, we recommend replicating a gut microbiome similar to the wild-type for optimal success. We further suggest that at the end of each publication a URL access be provided on Animal Microbial/Pathogen Exclusion Status that a study was based upon. This may help address the differences in results within a single laboratory or between laboratories around the world and improve translation success.","Dobson, Geoffrey P; Morris, Jodie L; Biros, Erik; Letson, Hayley L",Shock,207,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS The following parameters were investigated: type of vascular injury, anticoagulation therapy at time of procedure, anatomical district, caliper of the target artery, course of the landing zone, additional embolics, technical and clinical success, device related clinical complications. Technical success was defined as complete embolization without deployment of additional embolics after MVP release. Primary clinical success was considered as hemodynamic stability in emergency setting and resolution of the underlying vascular pathology in elective cases; secondary clinical success was considered clinical success after a second embolization session. RESULTS 116 MVP have been released in 104 patients (67 males and 37 females; mean age 61.3 years). The pullback release technique was adopted in each case. 85 patients were treated in emergent settings while in 19 patients the procedure was scheduled. The overall technical success was 75%. Primary clinical success was 96.1%, secondary clinical success 3% and clinical failure 0.9%. No statistical differences in terms of effectiveness were observed among patients assuming anticoagulation (p-value = 0.6). A straight and longer landing zone were statistically associated with higher technical success compared to curved and shorter ones, (p-values < 0.001 and = 0.048 respectively). MVP-3 and MVP-5 were the most frequently adopted models in this sample, in 29.8% and 49% of the patients respectively. No clinically adverse events directly related to MVP occurred; in 3 cases device migration was registered without clinical complications. CONCLUSION MVP is a safe and effective embolic agent. While eventual concomitant anticoagulation therapy did not influence the technical outcome, straight course and length of the landing zone are essential parameters to evaluate before deployment.","Giurazza, Francesco; Ierardi, Anna Maria; Contegiacomo, Andrea; Corvino, Fabio; Carrafiello, Giampaolo; Niola, Raffaella",CVIR endovascular,207,24

AIMS To provide additional information which may help clinicians target IPC on the most appropriate patients by exploring the variation in its effects on subgroups defined by predicted prognosis. METHODS A multicentre, parallel group, randomized trial enrolled immobile acute stroke patients and allocated them to IPC or no IPC. The primary outcome was proximal DVT at 30 days. Secondary outcomes at six-months included survival, disability, quality of life, and hospital costs. We stratified patients into quintiles according to their predicted prognosis at randomization, based on the Six Simple Variable model. RESULTS Between December 2008 and September 2012, we enrolled 2876 patients in 94 UK hospitals. Patients with the best predicted outcome had the lowest absolute risk of proximal DVT (6·7%) and death by six-months (9·3%). Allocation to IPC had little effect on DVT, survival, disability, quality of life, hospital length of stay, or costs. In patients with the worst predicted outcomes, the overall risk of DVT and death was 16·0% and 51·3%, respectively. IPC reduced DVT (odds reduction 34%) and improved survival 17% and significantly increased length of stay and hospital costs. In the three intermediate quintiles, IPC reduced the odds of DVT (35-43%) and improved survival (11-13%). Disability and quality of life at six-months depended on baseline severity but was not influenced significantly by IPC. CONCLUSIONS IPC appears to reduce the risk of DVT and probably improves survival in all immobile stroke patients, other than the fifth with the best prognosis. It therefore seems reasonable to recommend that IPC should be considered in all immobile stroke patients, but that the final decision should be based on a judgment about the individual's prognosis. In some, their prognosis for survival with an acceptable quality of life will be so poor that use of IPC might be considered futile, while at the other end of the spectrum, patients' risk of DVT, and of dying from VTE, may not be high enough to justify the modest cost and inconvenience of IPC use.","Dennis, Martin; Graham, Catriona; Smith, Joel; Forbes, John; Sandercock, Peter",International journal of stroke : official journal of the International Stroke Society,207,24

MATERIAL AND METHODS The records of 178 patients aged above 2 years who presented to pediatric emergency outpatient clinic with fever and respiratory tract infection findings between December 2013 and April 2014 were examined retrospectively. RESULTS At least one respiratory tract pathogen was detected by polymerase chain reaction in 78.6% (n=140) of the patients: influenza A 33.5%, influenza B 16.4%, respiratory syncytial virus 9.2%, adenovirus 7.8%, rhinovirus 7.1%, coronavirus 7.1%, human metapneumovirus 5.7%, human bocavirus 5.7%, parainfluenza virus 3.5%, coinfection 2.8%. The mean age of the patients was 6.3±3.6 years. Sixty-nine patients (49.2%) were aged between 2 and 5 years. Seventy-one patients (50.7%) were aged 5 years and above. Upper respiratory tract infection was found with a rate of 65.7% and lower respiratory tract infection was found with a rate of 34.2%. It was observed that the distribution of respiratory tract viruses showed variance by age groups. Influenza A infection was observed with the highest rate in both age groups. Influenza B was the second leading agent (p=0.008) above the age of 5 years and respiratory syncytial virus was the second leading agent in the 2-5 year age group (p=0.003). Influenza viruses were detected in 55.9% of 118 patients who were found to be compatible with the definition of ""influenza-like illness"" specified in the Center for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines and other viral agenst were detected in 44%. No difference could be found between the clinical pictures and radiological findings caused by influenza and other respiratory tract viruses. CONCLUSIONS In this study, it was concluded that influenza and other respiratory viruses can not be differentiated definitely by clinical and radiological findings, though there are some differences.","Aktürk, Hacer; Sütçü, Murat; Badur, Selim; Törün, Selda Hançerli; Çıtak, Agop; Erol, Oğuz Bülent; Somer, Ayper; Salman, Nuran",Turk pediatri arsivi,207,0

Infant RSV infection was determined by biweekly respiratory illness surveillance plus RSV PCR testing in their first RSV season and serum RSV antibodies after the season at ~ 1 year of age. RSV antibodies were detected by RSV A and B lysate enzyme immunoassay (lysate EIA). Antibody and PCR results on 1707 children included 327 RSV PCR positive (PCR+) and 1380 not RSV+. Of 327 PCR+ children, 314 (96%) were lysate EIA positive and 583/1380 (42%) children not PCR+ were positive.

However, whether this blood-pressure target is more or less effective than a higher target is unknown. METHODS In a multicenter, open-label trial, we randomly assigned 776 patients with septic shock to undergo resuscitation with a mean arterial pressure target of either 80 to 85 mm Hg (high-target group) or 65 to 70 mm Hg (low-target group). The primary end point was mortality at day 28. RESULTS At 28 days, there was no significant between-group difference in mortality, with deaths reported in 142 of 388 patients in the high-target group (36.6%) and 132 of 388 patients in the low-target group (34.0%) (hazard ratio in the high-target group, 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.84 to 1.38; P=0.57). There was also no significant difference in mortality at 90 days, with 170 deaths (43.8%) and 164 deaths (42.3%), respectively (hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.30; P=0.74). The occurrence of serious adverse events did not differ significantly between the two groups (74 events [19.1%] and 69 events [17.8%], respectively; P=0.64). However, the incidence of newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation was higher in the high-target group than in the low-target group. Among patients with chronic hypertension, those in the high-target group required less renal-replacement therapy than did those in the low-target group, but such therapy was not associated with a difference in mortality. CONCLUSIONS Targeting a mean arterial pressure of 80 to 85 mm Hg, as compared with 65 to 70 mm Hg, in patients with septic shock undergoing resuscitation did not result in significant differences in mortality at either 28 or 90 days.

Once formed and released from producer cells, these pseudovirions incorporate a luciferase reporter gene. Since they only contain the heterologous coronavirus spike protein on their surface, the particles behave like their native coronavirus counterparts for entry steps. As such, they are the excellent surrogates of native virions for studying viral entry into host cells. Upon successful entry and infection into target cells, the luciferase reporter gets integrated into the host cell genome and is expressed. Using a simple luciferase assay, transduced cells can be easily quantified. An important advantage of the procedure is that it can be performed in biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) facilities instead of BSL-3 facilities required for work with highly pathogenic coronaviruses such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Another benefit comes from its versatility as it can be applied to envelope proteins belonging to all three classes of viral fusion proteins, such as the class I influenza hemagglutinin (HA) and Ebola virus glycoprotein (GP), the class II Semliki forest virus E1 protein, or the class III vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein. A limitation of the methodology is that it can only recapitulate virus entry steps mediated by the envelope protein being investigated. For studying other viral life cycle steps, other methods are required. Examples of the many applications these pseudotype particles can be used in include investigation of host cell susceptibility and tropism and testing the effects of virus entry inhibitors to dissect viral entry pathways used.","Millet, Jean K; Tang, Tiffany; Nathan, Lakshmi; Jaimes, Javier A; Hsu, Hung-Lun; Daniel, Susan; Whittaker, Gary R",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,207,27

Several studies identified crucial barriers such as insufficient financial reimbursement. In contrast to the barriers-account, we assume that low implementation readiness of GPs may be less attributed to external barriers but rather more so to inherent characteristics of SBI. To test our assumption, we conducted a vignette study assessing the GPs' readiness to implement SBI in comparison to a pharmacological intervention also designed for the treatment of excessive drinkers in relation to standard or above-standard financial reimbursement. According to our hypothesis GPs should be less ready to implement SBI regardless of financial reimbursement. METHODS A convenience sample of GPs was recruited to answer the questionnaire. To assess the GPs' implementation readiness a 4-item 6-point Likert scale was developed and pretested. RESULTS One hundred forty GPs completed the questionnaire. GPs were more ready to implement the pharmacological intervention than SBI, F(1,132) = 27.58, p > .001 (main effect).

METHODS Prospective review of the first 50 patients who underwent LSG. Percentage change in body mass index (BMI), comorbidities, serum glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), lipid profiles, and medications were recorded. RESULTS Mean age was 52 years. Average BMI was 46 kg/m(2). There were no mortalities or staple line leaks. The percentage excess BMI loss was 47% and 54% at 6 and 12 months, respectively. After 6 months, fasting glucose level decreased from 127 to 93 mg/dL, and mean glycosylated hemoglobin decreased from 6.8% to 5.7%. At 1-year follow-up evaluation, serum cholesterol decreased from 182 to 168 mg/dL, mean triglycerides from 179 to 93 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein from 110 to 94 mg/dL, and high-density lipoprotein increased from 42 to 50 mg/dL.

Another important complication of peritoneal catheter insertion includes infection, which can prompt removal of the catheter. METHODS We performed a retrospective study between January 2005 and July 2011 of 61 patients who underwent laparoscopic placement of a Tenckhoff catheter and peritoneal dialysis at our institution using a single-port technique. We analysed complications of Tenckhoff insertion, specifically infection and the formation of hernias requiring operative management. RESULTS Infections noted in our patients included peritonitis (10%) and exit-site infection (5%). Of the five patients who required re-insertion of Tenckhoff catheter, four were for infective complications. A total of seven hernias developed in five (8%) of patients, mostly inguinal or umbilical near the Hassan port entry site. DISCUSSION With infection and hernia formation being the main contributors to failure of the procedure, actively addressing the entry site and areas predisposed to hernia formation, observing aseptic technique and meticulous attention to early signs of complications during follow-up are vital to improve success rates. The outcomes of the laparoscopic single-port insertion technique shows promise compared with conventional Tenckhoff catheter insertion techniques.","Bunker, Daniel; Ilie, Victor; Fisher, Dean",ANZ journal of surgery,207,12

The first positive case in Switzerland was confirmed on 25 February 2020 in a patient from canton Tessin, who most likely caught the virus during a visit to Milan, Italy [2]. The country has since been preparing for an imminent public health emergency caused by the pandemic. As of 14 May 2020, the Swiss healthcare system is facing a total of 30,463 corona virus-positive people [3]. With numbers of new infections decreasing after the first pandemic wave, the continuing endemic situation will continue to be a major challenge for the Swiss healthcare system. It remains crucial to separate the clinically low-symptomatic from the severely affected patients in order to offer a specific therapeutic strategy to every SARS-CoV-2 patient. Reports from Chinese cohorts describe an increasing role of imaging strategies in the detection and surveillance of COVID-19 patients because of insufficient testing sensitivity of real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests [4]. Chest computed tomography (CT), with a reported sensitivity of up to 97% [5, 6], gained importance particularly in patients with false negative RT-PCR results. In this short communication, we describe our first clinical experiences with 55 COVID-19 patients in Central Switzerland, who were either imaged with a standard chest x-ray, chest CT, or both. We provide an illustrative and schematic description of typical COVID-19 imaging features and suggest that imaging plays an important role in the clinical work-up of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients.

In this study we examined cross phosphorylation of RprY on tyrosine residues and its importance for RprY function. We show that RprY reacts with phosphotyrosine antibodies, and a tyrosine (Y) residue at position 41 is predicted to be solvent accessible. Loss of RprY increased the level of heterotypic community development with Streptococcus gordonii, and the community-suppressive function of RprY required Y41. Expression of the Mfa1 fimbrial adhesin was increased in the rprY mutant and in the mutant complemented with rprY containing a Y41F mutation. In a microscale thermophoresis assay, recombinant RprY protein bound to the promoter region of mfa1, and binding was diminished in RprY with a Y41F substitution. RprY was required for virulence of P. gingivalis in a murine model of alveolar bone loss. Transcriptional profiling indicated that RprY can control the expression of genes encoding the type IX secretion system (T9SS) machinery and virulence factors secreted through the T9SS, including the gingipain proteases and peptidylarginine deiminase (PPAD). Collectively, these results establish the RprY response regulator as a component of the tyrosine phosphorylation regulon in P. gingivalis, which can independently control heterotypic community development through the Mfa1 fimbriae, and virulence through the T9SS.","Shen, Daonan; Perpich, John D; Stocke, Kendall S; Yakoumatos, Lan; Fitzsimonds, Zackary R; Liu, Chengcheng; Miller, Daniel P; Lamont, Richard J",Molecular oral microbiology,207,17

Little is known about the experiences of critical care physicians caring for the sickest coronavirus disease 2019 patients. Our goal is to understand how high stress levels and shortages faced by these physicians during Spring 2020 have evolved. DESIGN We surveyed (October 23, 2020 to November 16, 2020) U.S. critical care physicians treating coronavirus disease 2019 patients who participated in a National survey earlier in the pandemic (April 23, 2020 to May 3, 2020) regarding their stress and shortages they faced. SETTING ICU. PATIENTS Coronavirus disease 2019 patients. INTERVENTION Irrelevant. MEASUREMENT Physician emotional distress/physical exhaustion: low (not at all/not much), moderate, or high (a lot/extreme). Shortage indicators: insufficient ICU-trained staff and shortages in medication, equipment, or personal protective equipment requiring protocol changes. MAIN RESULTS Of 2,375 U.S. critical care attending physicians who responded to the initial survey, we received responses from 1,356 (57.1% response rate), 97% of whom (1,278) recently treated coronavirus disease 2019 patients. Two thirds of physicians (67.6% [864]) reported moderate or high levels of emotional distress in the Spring versus 50.7% (763) in the Fall. Reports of staffing shortages persisted with 46.5% of Fall respondents (594) reporting a staff shortage versus 48.3% (617) in the Spring. Meaningful shortages of medication and equipment reported in the Spring were largely alleviated. Although personal protective equipment shortages declined by half, they remained substantial. CONCLUSIONS Stress, staffing, and, to a lesser degree, personal protective equipment shortages faced by U.S. critical care physicians remain high. Stress levels were higher among women. Considering the persistence of these findings, rising levels of infection nationally raise concerns about the capacity of the U.S. critical care system to meet ongoing and future demands.","Gray, Bradley M; Vandergrift, Jonathan L; Barnhart, Brendan J; Reddy, Siddharta G; Chesluk, Benjamin J; Stevens, Jennifer S; Lipner, Rebecca S; Lynn, Lorna A; Barnett, Michael L; Landon, Bruce E",Critical care medicine,207,31

This systematic review summarises the evidence of follow-up studies of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) reporting on long-term effects of prenatal exposure to OADs on offspring. METHODS The MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL databases were searched from inception to April 2018 for the concepts antidiabetic agents and prenatal exposure (or pregnancy and offspring/child) in combination with an RCT search filter. RCTs evaluating post-neonatal health effects in offspring and comparing maternal treatment with an OAD with no treatment, placebo, an alternative OAD or insulin during pregnancy were eligible for inclusion. Two independent researchers selected, extracted and assessed the data. Meta-analyses were performed using a random effects model and the Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool was used for quality assessment. RESULTS Ten studies were included, with a maximal follow-up duration of 9 years, comprising 778 children of mothers with GDM or PCOS who were randomised to either metformin or insulin/placebo during pregnancy. Meta-analysis showed that children prenatally exposed to metformin were heavier compared to controls (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.26 [95% CI 0.11-0.41]), but not taller (SMD 0.10 [95% CI -0.14-0.33]). Additionally, offspring body mass index (BMI) z scores did not differ according to metformin exposure (mean difference 0.30 [95% CI -0.01-0.61]). Individual small studies reported that prenatal exposure to metformin was associated with greater mid-upper arm, head and waist circumferences, biceps skinfolds, waist-to-height ratio, more arm fat, higher fasting glucose, ferritin and lower LDL cholesterol in offspring. CONCLUSION Prenatal exposure to metformin is associated with increased offspring weight, but not with height or BMI. Larger follow-up studies are needed to confirm and look into the implications of these findings.

Few data are available on SDB and cardiac adrenergic impairment evaluated at myocardial level. The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between SDB, cardiac sympathetic innervation assessed by 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG) imaging and prognosis in HF. METHODS Observational, prospective study enrolling patients with HF and reduced systolic function. Patients underwent nocturnal cardiorespiratory monitoring to assess SDB presence by apnoea/hypopnoea index (AHI), and 123I-MIBG imaging to calculate heart-to-mediastinum (H/M) ratios and washout rate. Patients were prospectively followed for 29±18 months for the combined endpoint of cardiovascular death and HF hospitalisation. RESULTS Ninety-four patients (66.1±9.8 years; left ventricular ejection fraction 32±7%) were enrolled; 72 (77%) showed SDB and, compared with non-SDB, significantly reduced early (1.67±0.22 vs 1.77±0.13; p=0.019) and late H/M ratios (1.50±0.22 vs 1.61±0.23; p=0.038). Dividing patients into two groups according to SDB severity, patients with a moderate-severe disturbance (AHI >15; n=43) showed significantly worse survival for the composite study outcome (log-rank test, p=0.001) with respect to patients with mild or no disorder (AHI ≤15; n=51). Adding SDB variables to the already known prognostic role of 123I-MIBG imaging, we observed a worse survival in patients with both SDB and H/M impairment. CONCLUSIONS Patients with systolic HF and SDB show more impaired cardiac adrenergic innervation assessed by 123I-MIBG imaging, and more adverse prognosis compared with HF patients without SDB.","Scala, Oriana; Paolillo, Stefania; Formisano, Roberto; Pellegrino, Teresa; Rengo, Giuseppe; Gargiulo, Paola; De Michele, Fausto; Starace, Antonio; Rapacciuolo, Antonio; Parisi, Valentina; Prastaro, Maria; Piscopo, Valentina; Dellegrottaglie, Santo; Bruzzese, Dario; De Martino, Fabiana; Parente, Antonio; Leosco, Dario; Trimarco, Bruno; Cuocolo, Alberto; Perrone-Filardi, Pasquale",Heart,207,14

We have noted a paucity of lymph nodes in rectal cancer specimens after neoadjuvant therapy, positing that the number of lymph nodes depends on the response to radiation and may not be an appropriate benchmark. Our purpose was to determine whether the number of lymph nodes harvested after neoadjuvant therapy is a useful quality indicator. METHODS A database of rectal cancer patients was queried to identify patients undergoing total mesorectal excision after neoadjuvant chemoradiation between January 1997 and August 2007. We compared patients with <12 lymph nodes to those with >or=12 lymph nodes relative to multiple patient and treatment factors. RESULTS One hundred seventy-six patients were identified (119 men; mean age, 60.4 y (range, 22-87)). Mean lymph node harvest was 10.1 (range, 1-38). Only 28% had >or=12 lymph nodes and 32% had <6 lymph nodes. There was no statistically significant difference in lymph node harvest relative to radiation dosage, age, tumor response, or type of surgery. There was no correlation between the number of lymph nodes harvested and the number of nodes positive for cancer. CONCLUSIONS With a standardized surgical technique and pathologic evaluation, the number of lymph nodes present after neoadjuvant chemoradiation and total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer varies greatly.","Marks, J H; Valsdottir, E B; Rather, A A; Nweze, I C; Newman, D A; Chernick, M R",Diseases of the colon and rectum,207,1

Yet, the settings, goals, scale, and key features of these programs are not widely known. OBJECTIVE To identify and synthesize research on in-service nurse mentoring programs. METHODS We reviewed nurse mentoring research from six databases. Studies either referred explicitly to in-service nurse mentoring programs, were reviews of such programs, or concerned nurse training/education in which mentoring was an essential component. RESULTS We included 69 articles from 11 countries, published from 1995 to 2019. Most articles were from high-income countries (n = 46) and in rural areas (n = 22). Programs were developed to strengthen clinical care (particularly maternal and neonatal care), promote evidence-based practice, promote retention, support new graduate nurses, and develop nurse leaders. Of the articles with sufficient data, they typically described small programs implemented in one facility (n = 23), with up to ten mentors (n = 13), with less than 50 mentees (n = 25), meeting at least once a month (n = 27), and lasting at least a year (n = 24). While over half of the studies (n = 36) described programs focused almost exclusively on clinical skills acquisition, many (n = 33) specified non-clinical professional development activities. Reflective practice featured to a varying extent in many articles (n = 29). Very few (n = 6) explicitly identified the theoretical basis of their programs. CONCLUSIONS Although the literature about in-service nurse mentoring comes mostly from small programs in high-income countries, the largest nurse mentoring programs in the world are in low- and middle-income countries. Much can be learned from studying these programs in greater detail. Future research should analyze key features of programs to make models of mentoring more transparent and translatable. If carefully designed and flexibly implemented, in-service nurse mentoring represents an exciting avenue for enhancing the role of nurses and midwives in people-centered health system strengthening.

BACKGROUND A global team from Ireland and the United States collaborated with stakeholders, using a practice doctorate approach to identify geographic healthcare needs, the current state of the education and the evolving roles of advanced nursing practice. In Ireland, current policy initiatives call for expanding the capacity for advanced nurse practitioners to meet healthcare needs in community settings. SOURCES OF EVIDENCE Further assessment data were required from stakeholders to inform graduate nursing education to prepare advanced practice nurses to fulfil increasingly complex healthcare needs. The practice doctorate approach included review of literature, current policy and assessment with interviews, dialogue and the development of working relationships with policymakers, academics and practitioners. DISCUSSION The current state and future vision of graduate nursing education are evolving. A force field analysis identified promoting and restraining factors to the desired state of development of the primary care advanced practice role. Relationship building with stakeholders and sharing of expertise was key to engage academia and policymakers to address identified restraining forces. Short-term outcomes included development of collaborative relationships between practice, academia and policymakers, curricular development for the primary care nurse practitioner and intentionally shared dissemination to promote community graduate nursing education. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE This innovative practice scholarship approach was used to assess and promote advanced nursing practice impact and promote the nursing profession globally. IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY Successful collaboration between two global partners was achieved to promote policy objectives for both nursing and health care, with the ultimate goal of improving health outcomes and population health.","Conrad, Dianne; Burson, Rosanne; Moran, Katherine; Kesten, Karen; Corrigan, Catherine; Hussey, Pamela; Pohl, Elizabeth",International nursing review,207,1

METHODS RE-SPECT CVT was a Phase 3, prospective, randomized, parallel-group, open-label, multicenter, exploratory trial with blinded end point adjudication. We allocated patients with acute CVT to dabigatran 150 mg twice daily or dose-adjusted warfarin, for 24 weeks and obtained a standardized MR protocol including time-of-flight MR angiography, 3-dimensionalphase-contrast venography, and 3-dimensional contrast-enhanced MR venography at the end of the treatment period. A blinded adjudication committee assessed the presence of dAVF in a predefined substudy of the trial. RESULTS We analyzed development of dAVF in 112 of 120 randomized patients; 57 allocated to dabigatran and 55 to warfarin. For 3 (2.7%) of these 112 patients, quality of follow-up imaging was insufficient to evaluate dAVF. A dAVF (Borden I) was found in 1 patient (0.9%) allocated to warfarin; however, this dAVF was already present at baseline. The patient did not present with hemorrhage at baseline or during the trial and was asymptomatic at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Despite systematic imaging, we found no new dAVF 6 months after CVT. Routine follow-up cerebral MR angiography aiming to detect new dAVF 6 months after CVT has a very low yield. REGISTRATION URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

Article 82 of the Spanish Law 29/2006 on Guarantees and Rational Use of Medicines and Medical Devices establishes that it is the responsibility of Hospital Pharmacy Services ""to participate in and coordinate the purchase of medicines and medical devices in the hospital to ensure an efficient acquisition and rational use of medical devices"". For this reason, working groups of the Spanish Society of Hospital Pharmacy and other scientific societies have issued technical guidelines and consensus statements to provide technical support and updated information on the use of masks, individual protection equipments and other medical devices. In addition, the shortage of medical devices caused by the high demand has resulted in the uncontrolled production and distribution of medical devices. This phenomenon, added to the fraudulent selling of medical devices, highlights the need for a closer surveillance of the market to guarantee the efficacy and safety of available medical devices. A rational use of medical devices is necessary to ensure the availability and safety of these products, which requires the involvement of different stakeholders, including hospital pharmacists. Thus, it is essential that hospital pharmacists receive specific training in technical aspects concerning the possession and use of medical devices. This will help guarantee an effective and safe use of medical products. The acquisition and use of medical devices requires a keen understanding of the technical and legal aspects concerning these products, which makes hospital pharmacists essential for the integral management of medical devices.","Climent-Ballester, Seira; Selva-Otaolaurruchi, Juan",Farmacia hospitalaria : organo oficial de expresion cientifica de la Sociedad Espanola de Farmacia Hospitalaria,207,23

Objective To characterize mental state and ocular surface state of ophthalmologists and ophthalmic nurses in Wuhan, China, and similar areas during the COVID-19 outbreak. Design, Setting, and Participants This survey study assessed ophthalmologists and ophthalmic nurses in Wuhan, China, and Jiangxi, China, a province approximately 300 km south of Wuhan. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Van Dream Anxiety Scale, and the Ocular Surface Disease Index were used to conduct questionnaire surveys via a messaging and social media app. Main Outcomes and Measures Mean scores from the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (0-10 points), the Van Dream Anxiety Scale (0-100 points), and the Ocular Surface Disease Index (0-100 points). Results Of 126 individuals, there were 42 ophthalmologists (33.3%) and 21 ophthalmic nurses (16.7%) from Wuhan and 42 ophthalmologists (33.3%) and 21 nurses (16.7%) from Jiangxi. The mean (SD) age of ophthalmologists was 36.1 (7.6) years in Wuhan and 41.2 (8.8) years in Jiangxi. For ophthalmic nurses, the mean (SD) age was 35.2 (7.4) years in Wuhan and 33.4 (7.9) years in Jiangxi. The response rate for ophthalmologists was 90.3% (84 of 93) and for nurses was 91.3% (42 of 46). The participation rate of ophthalmologists and nurses in Wuhan was 0.06% (42 of 70 000) and 0.07% (21 of 30 000), respectively; the participation rate in Jiangxi was 0.06% (42 of 70 000; 21 of 35 000) for both groups. In Wuhan, the mean (SD) Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (anxiety and depression were counted as separate scores), Van Dream Anxiety Scale, and the Ocular Surface Disease Index scores were 6.90 (2.30), 7.38 (2.19), 24.52 (5.86), and 43.90 (3.74), respectively, in ophthalmologists and 8.67 (3.04), 9.38 (2.64), 21.48 (6.15), and 40.05 (6.67), respectively, in ophthalmic nurses. In Jiangxi, these scores were 5.67 (2.89), 4.90 (3.15), 12.76 (7.27), and 38.79 (7.78), respectively, in ophthalmologists and 4.67 (3.20), 4.33 (3.23), 10.10 (7.62), and 41.52 (5.92), respectively, in ophthalmic nurses. The difference (95% CI) between the 2 regions for these scores in ophthalmologists was 2.48 (95% CI, 1.30-3.65), 11.76 (95% CI, 8.90-14.63), 5.12 (95% CI, 2.45-7.79), and 5.12 (95% CI, 2.47-7.77), respectively, and in ophthalmic nurses was 4.16 (95% CI, 2.05-5.95), 5.05 (95% CI, 3.21-6.89), 11.38 (95% CI, 7.06-15.70), and -1.48 (95% CI, -5.41 to 2.25), respectively. Conclusions and Relevance These findings suggest that ophthalmologists and ophthalmic nurses in Wuhan experienced more anxiety and depression and reported greater ocular surface abnormalities than counterparts outside of Wuhan, but the wide CIs preclude concluding confidently that there were differences.","Shao, Yi; Zhang, Wei",JAMA ophthalmology,207,1

Rather than cooperate to contain and respond to a common threat, the world's leading powers, the United States and China, increasingly blamed each other through wildly speculative theories about the origins of the virus. The World Health Organization (WHO) sought to coordinate a global response but it has been hamstrung and come under attack. Given past cooperation between major powers to mobilize and eradicate smallpox and previous U.S. leadership to fight HIV/AIDS and the 2014 West African Ebola crisis, the limited cooperation and lack of leadership are puzzling. What explains the anemic global response to date? This paper draws from structural international relations theory to suggest a partial but somewhat dissatisfying answer. International organizations are inherently weak faced with opposition by major powers. The international system simultaneously incentivizes states to cooperate and address common threats but at the same time encourages countries to take care of themselves, potentially at the expense of others. Which of these motives dominates cannot be explained by structural theory, requiring us to look to other factors such as the attributes of states or of leaders themselves.","Busby, Joshua W","Journal of health politics, policy and law",207,2

As in previous pandemics, concerns for limited resources and a sustainable medical workforce have been on the forefront of infrastructure modifications. Consequently, surgical specialties have needed to consider each surgical case for necessity and safety during the COVID-19 outbreak. At our institution, availability of SARS-CoV-2 assay has allowed preoperative testing of asymptomatic surgical patients. Aim/Objective To better define the prevalence of asymptomatic carriers in a surgical population and to better understand the impact of testing on our personal protective equipment (PPE) supply. Methods We began routine, preoperative testing for all asymptomatic patients coming to our academic medical centre on 30 March 2020. Scheduled surgeries were deemed urgent by the surgeon with a review for appropriateness by a novel surgical committee. A retrospective patient chart review was performed. Emergency surgeries were excluded. Asymptomatic patients with positive test results had their surgeries rescheduled at the discretion of the surgeon and patient. Patients who tested negative underwent surgery with staff using standard PPE. Results Eighty-four asymptomatic surgical patients were tested preoperatively with three (3.6%) testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. Preoperative testing saved 498 N95 respirators over this time period. Discussion This is the first report of routine COVID-19 preoperative testing in an asymptomatic surgical population. Within this population, there is a 3.6% rate of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers. Through this practice, personnel exposure can be minimised and access to PPE can be preserved.","Bloom, Joshua A; Erlichman, Zachary; Tian, Tina; Doron, Shira; Chen, Lilian; Mansur, Kristen; Tarnoff, Michael E",Journal of infection prevention,207,16

Evaluating current implementation efforts and identifying current research gaps may inform future implementation. This scoping review explores studies implementing cancer-specific exercise programs to determine their pragmatic characteristics and evaluate potential for translation into practice. METHODS A systematic literature search was conducted using five databases (up to July 2020) to identify implementation studies that used qualitative or quantitative methods. Program pragmatism was evaluated using the PRECIS/RE-AIM tool. RESULTS Fourteen articles were included for review. While programs were moderately pragmatic (average: 3.4; range: 2.8-4.2), variability was observed between scoring domains. Programs scored higher (more pragmatic) in domains typical for effectiveness studies, including participant eligibility, follow-up intensity, primary trial outcome, and analysis of primary outcome. In contrast, programs scored lower (less pragmatic) in domains aligned with implementation science, including intervention flexibility, adoption, implementation, and maintenance. Limited information was reported regarding program fidelity, adaptations, and maintenance/sustainability. CONCLUSION Researchers should consider the pragmatism of interventions, the nuances of program adoption and implementation at the setting level, and the transition and integration of programming into the healthcare system. Future studies may benefit from the inclusion of decision-makers and implementation experts and shifting focus towards flexible programming. PRECIS/RE-AIM may facilitate the evaluation of programs throughout the study design and implementation process. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS The implementation of pragmatic exercise programs that are both scalable and sustainable is needed so that cancer survivors can experience exercise-related benefits beyond research settings.","Purdy, Graeme M; Sobierajski, Frances M; Dolgoy, Naomi D; McNeely, Margaret L",Journal of cancer survivorship : research and practice,207,1

However, traditional methods of disseminating and digesting medical information can be time-consuming and cumbersome. In a pilot study, the authors used social listening to quickly extract information from social media channels to explore what people with COVID-19 are talking about regarding symptoms and disease progression. The goal was to determine whether, by amplifying patient voices, new information could be identified that might have been missed through other sources. Two data sets from social media groups of people with or presumed to have COVID-19 were analyzed: a Facebook group poll, and conversation data from a Reddit group including detailed disease natural history-like posts. Content analysis and a customized analytics engine that incorporates machine learning and natural language processing were used to quickly identify symptoms mentioned. Key findings include more than 20 symptoms in the data sets that were not listed in online lists of symptoms from 4 respected medical information sources. The disease natural history-like posts revealed that people can experience symptoms for many weeks and that some symptoms change over time. This study demonstrates that social media can offer novel insights into patient experiences as a source of real-world data.

This is consistent with an increased abundance of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) compared with older children and adults. Using a murine model of neonatal bacterial sepsis, we demonstrate that MDSCs modulate their activity during an infection to enhance immune suppressive functions. A gene expression analysis shows that MDSCs increased NOS2, Arg-1 and IL-27p28 expression in vitro and in vivo in response to Escherichia coli O1:K1:H7 and this is regulated at the level of the gene expression. Changes in the effector gene expression are consistent with increased enzymatic activity and cytokine secretion. The neonatal MDSCs express toll-like receptor (TLR) 2, 4 and 5 capable of recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPS) on E. coli. However, a variable level of effector expression was achieved in response to LPS, peptidoglycan or flagellin. Individual bacterial PAMPs did not stimulate the expression of Arg-l and IL-27p28 equivalently to E. coli. However, the upregulation of NOS2 was achieved in response to LPS, peptidoglycan and flagella. The increased immune suppressive profile translated to an enhanced suppression of CD4+ T cell proliferation. Collectively, these findings increase our understanding of the dynamic nature of MDSC activity and suggest that these cells abundant in early life can acquire activity during an infection that suppresses protective immunity.","Vance, Jordan K; Rawson, Travis W; Povroznik, Jessica M; Brundage, Kathleen M; Robinson, Cory M",International journal of molecular sciences,207,1

An international comparison of potentially inappropriate treatments allows insight into common issues and country-specific challenges of end-of-life care in nursing homes and helps direct health care policy in this area. OBJECTIVES To estimate the prevalence of potentially inappropriate treatments in the last week of life in nursing home residents, and analyze the differences in prevalence between countries. METHODS A cross-sectional study of deceased residents in nursing homes (2015) in six European countries: Belgium (Flanders), England, Finland, Italy, the Netherlands and Poland. Potentially inappropriate treatments included: enteral administration of nutrition, parental administration of nutrition, artificial fluids, resuscitation, artificial ventilation, blood transfusion, chemotherapy/radiotherapy, dialysis, surgery, antibiotics, statins, antidiabetics, new oral anticoagulants. Nurses were questioned about whether these treatments were administered in the last week of life. RESULTS We included 1,384 deceased residents from 322 nursing homes. In most countries, potentially inappropriate treatments were rarely used, with a maximum of 18.3% of residents receiving at least one treatment in Poland. Exceptions were antibiotics in all countries (between 11.3% in Belgium and 45% in Poland), artificial nutrition and hydration in Poland (54.3%) and Italy (41%) and antidiabetics in Poland (19.7%). CONCLUSION Although the prevalence of potentially inappropriate treatments in the last week of life was generally low, antibiotics were frequently prescribed in all countries. In Poland and Italy, the prevalence of artificial administration of food/fluids in the last week of life was high, possibly reflecting country differences in legislation, care organization and culture, and the palliative care competences of staff.","Honinx, Elisabeth; Van den Block, L; Piers, R; Van Kuijk, S M J; Onwuteaka-Philipsen, B D; Payne, S; Szczerbińska, K; Gambassi, G G; Finne-Soveri, H; Deliens, L; Smets, T",Journal of pain and symptom management,207,30

The sample week of March 23, 2020. The sample was poststratification weighted to ensure a balanced representation across social and demographic subgroups (gender, age, income, race or ethnicity, geography). The sample comprised 51% female; 23% non-White; 18% Hispanic; 25% of households with children under 18 years of age; 55% unmarried; and nearly 20% unemployed, laid off, or furloughed at the time of the interview. Respondents were fearful, averaging a score of nearly 7 on a scale of 10 when asked how fearful they were of COVID-19. Preliminary analysis suggests clear spatial diffusion of COVID-19 fear. Fear appears to be concentrated in regions with the highest reported COVID-19 cases. Significant differences across several U.S. census regions are noted (p < .01). Additionally, significant bivariate relationships were found between socially vulnerable respondents (female, Asians, Hispanic, foreign-born, families with children) and fear, as well as with mental health consequences (anxiety and depressive symptoms). Depressive symptoms, on average, were high (16+ on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale), and more than 25% of the sample reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms. More in-depth psychosocial research is needed using nationally representative samples that can help to inform potential mental health risks, as well as by targeting specific mental health interventions.

It should be noted that among these drugs there is not a single new drug developed specifically for the treatment of COVID-19, the recommended and used drugs have previously been used to treat, as a rule, diseases of the viral etiology, less often another pathology. These suggestions are often based on analogy, the hypothesis of their supposed effectiveness for COVID-19.

Many viruses have evolved countermeasures to inhibit the IFN pathway, thereby subverting the innate antiviral response. Here, we demonstrate that the mildly myocarditic reovirus type 1 Lang (T1L), but not the nonmyocarditic reovirus type 3 Dearing, represses IFN induction of a subset of ISGs and that this repressor function segregates with the T1L M1 gene. Concordantly, the T1L M1 gene product, mu2, dramatically inhibits IFN-beta-induced reporter gene expression. Surprisingly, T1L infection does not degrade components of the ISGF3 complex or interfere with STAT1 or STAT2 nuclear translocation as has been observed for other viruses. Instead, infection with T1L or reassortant or recombinant viruses containing the T1L M1 gene results in accumulation of interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) in the nucleus. This effect has not been previously described for any virus and suggests that mu2 modulates IRF9 interactions with STATs for both ISGF3 function and nuclear export. The M1 gene is a determinant of virus strain-specific differences in the IFN response, which are linked to virus strain-specific differences in induction of murine myocarditis. We find that virus-induced myocarditis is associated with repression of IFN function, providing new insights into the pathophysiology of this disease. Together, these data provide the first report of an increase in IRF9 nuclear accumulation associated with viral subversion of the IFN response and couple virus strain-specific differences in IFN antagonism to the pathogenesis of viral myocarditis.","Zurney, Jennifer; Kobayashi, Takeshi; Holm, Geoffrey H; Dermody, Terence S; Sherry, Barbara",Journal of virology,207,1

In the present study, we have designed two multi-epitope vaccines (MEVs) composed of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL), helper T lymphocyte (HTL) and B cell epitopes overlap, bearing the potential to elicit cellular as well as humoral immune response. We have used truncated (residues 10-153) Onchocerca volvulus activation-associated secreted protein-1, as molecular adjuvants at N terminal of both the MEVs. Selected overlapping epitopes of both the MEVs were further validated for stable molecular interactions with their respective human leukocyte antigen class I and II allele binders. Moreover, CTL epitopes were further studied for their molecular interaction with Transporter associated with antigen processing. Furthermore, after tertiary structure modelling, both the MEVs were validated for their stable molecular interaction with Toll-Like Receptors 2 and 4. Codon-optimized cDNA of both the MEVs were analyzed for their potential high level of expression in the mammalian cell line (Human) needed for their further in-vivo testing.

We here report that the in vitro anti-norovirus activity of the protease inhibitor rupintrivir is extended to murine noroviruses and that rupintrivir clears human cells from their Norwalk replicon after only two passages of antiviral pressure. In addition, we demonstrate that rupintrivir inhibits the human norovirus (genogroup II [GII]) protease and further explain the inhibitory effect of the molecule by means of molecular modeling on the basis of the crystal structure of the Norwalk virus protease. The combination of rupintrivir with the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors 2'-C-methylcytidine and favipiravir (T-705) resulted in a merely additive antiviral effect. The fact that rupintrivir is active against noroviruses belonging to genogroup I (Norwalk virus), genogroup V (murine norovirus), and the recombinant 3C-like protease of a GII norovirus suggests that the drug exerts cross-genotypic anti-norovirus activity and will thus most likely be effective against the clinically relevant human norovirus strains.

RECENT FINDINGS Noninvasive ventilation is strongly advised for the treatment of hypercapnic respiratory failure and recent evidence justifies its use in patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure when delivered by helmet. Indeed, such interface allows alveolar recruitment by providing high level of positive end-expiratory pressure, which improves hypoxemia. On the other hand, high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy is effective in patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure and some articles support its use in patients with hypercapnia. However, early identification of noninvasive respiratory supports treatment failure is crucial to prevent delayed orotracheal intubation and protective invasive mechanical ventilation. SUMMARY Noninvasive ventilation is the first-line therapy in patients with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure because of pneumonia. Although an increasing amount of evidence investigated the application of noninvasive respiratory support to hypoxemic respiratory failure, the optimal ventilatory strategy in this setting is uncertain. Noninvasive mechanical ventilation delivered by helmet and high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy appear as promising tools but their role needs to be confirmed by future research.","Cutuli, Salvatore Lucio; Grieco, Domenico Luca; Menga, Luca Salvatore; De Pascale, Gennaro; Antonelli, Massimo",Current opinion in infectious diseases,207,24

APPROACH Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), charge storage capacity (CSC), charge injection limit (CIL), and voltage transient (VT) impedance were measured bench-top before and after implant and in vivo. Coated Pt-Ir and uncoated Pt electrode arrays were implanted into cochlea of normal hearing rats and stimulated for ~4 hours/day, 5 days/week for 5 weeks. Neural function was monitored using electrically-evoked auditory brainstem responses. After explant, the electrode surfaces were assessed, and cochleae examined histologically. MAIN RESULTS When measured on bench-top before and after stimulation, Pt-Ir coated electrodes had significantly lower VT impedance (p < 0.001) and significantly higher CSC (p < 0.001) and CIL (p < 0.001) compared to uncoated Pt electrodes. In vivo, the CSC and CIL of Pt-Ir were significantly higher than Pt throughout the implantation period (p = 0.047 and p < 0.001, respectively); however, the VT impedance (p = 0.3) was not. There was no difference in foreign body response between material cohorts, although cochleae implanted with coated electrodes contained small deposits of Pt-Ir. There was no evidence of increased neural loss or loss of neural function in either group. Surface examination revealed no Pt corrosion on any electrodes. SIGNIFICANCE Electrodeposited Pt-Ir electrodes demonstrated significant improvements in electrochemical performance on the bench-top and in vivo compared to uncoated Pt. Neural function and tissue response to Pt-Ir electrodes were not different from uncoated Pt, despite small deposits of Pt-Ir in the tissue capsule.

Previous efforts to create heterobifunctional protein conjugates suffered from heterogeneity in domain stoichiometry, which in part led to the failure of antibody-enzyme conjugates in clinical trials. We used the megamolecule approach to synthesize anti-HER2 nanobody-cytosine deaminase conjugates with tunable numbers of nanobody and enzyme domains in a single, covalent molecule. Linking two nanobody domains to one enzyme domain improved avidity to a human cancer cell line by 4-fold but did not increase cytotoxicity significantly due to lowered enzyme activity. In contrast, a megamolecule composed of one nanobody and two enzyme domains resulted in an 8-fold improvement in the catalytic efficiency and increased the cytotoxic effect by over 5-fold in spheroid culture, indicating that the multimeric structure allowed for an increase in local drug activation. Our work demonstrates that the megamolecule strategy can be used to study structure-function relationships of protein conjugate therapeutics with synthetic control of protein domain stoichiometry.","Metcalf, Kevin J; Kimmel, Blaise R; Sykora, Daniel J; Modica, Justin A; Parker, Kelly A; Berens, Eric; Dai, Raymond; Dravid, Vinayak P; Werb, Zena; Mrksich, Milan",Bioconjugate chemistry,207,1

METHODS A state-transition Markov model was developed, in which patients may experience surgery, post-surgery complications, diabetes mellitus type 2, cardiovascular diseases or die. Transition probabilities, costs, and utilities were obtained from the Italian and international literature. Three types of surgeries were considered: gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, and adjustable gastric banding. A base-case analysis was performed for the population, the characteristics of which were obtained from surgery candidates in Italy. RESULTS In the base-case analysis, over 10 years, bariatric surgery led to cost increment of EUR 2,661 and generated additional 1.1 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Over a lifetime, surgery led to savings of EUR 8,649, additional 0.5 life years and 3.2 QALYs. Bariatric surgery was cost-effective at 10 years with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of EUR 2,412/QALY and dominant over conservative management over a lifetime. CONCLUSION In a comprehensive decision analytic model, a current mix of surgical methods for bariatric surgery was cost-effective at 10 years and cost-saving over the lifetime of the Italian patient cohort considered in this analysis.","Lucchese, Marcello; Borisenko, Oleg; Mantovani, Lorenzo Giovanni; Cortesi, Paolo Angelo; Cesana, Giancarlo; Adam, Daniel; Burdukova, Elisabeth; Lukyanov, Vasily; Di Lorenzo, Nicola",Obesity facts,207,1

Main outcome measures included demographics, comorbidities, and post-operative complications. RESULTS 36 patients were identified. Post-operative wound complications included five surgical site infections. At a median of 27 months, there were five recurrent hernias (13.9%), 2 of which were parastomal, but no episodes of intestinal obstruction/fistula. CONCLUSIONS Utilization of AMB for large posterior layer deficits results in acceptable rates of perioperative wound morbidity, effective PCS repairs, and does not increase intestinal morbidity or fistula formation.","Winder, J S; Majumder, A; Fayezizadeh, M; Novitsky, Y W; Pauli, E M",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,207,1

We explored the association of serum selenium levels in early pregnancy with the risk of GDM and preterm birth among Chinese women. We included 398 women with a singleton pregnancy, who were followed up prospectively from the first prenatal visit until delivery. Serum selenium levels were measured in the first trimester. After delivery, data concerning mothers and their children were sourced from medical records by researchers who were blind to the participants' selenium status. Of the 398 women, 71 (17.8%) had GDM, 21(5.3%) had preterm birth, and 266 (66.8%) had selenium deficiency (serum selenium < 70 μg/L). Women in the upper three quartiles of serum selenium level did not have a significantly lower risk of GDM or preterm birth than those in the lowest quartile after adjustment for covariates (all p > 0.05). When serum selenium levels were classified as normal or deficient, the risk of GDM or preterm birth among women with normal serum selenium levels was still not lower than that of women with deficient serum selenium levels after adjustment for covariates (all p > 0.05). Although selenium deficiency was common in the Chinese women in our cohort, our results indicate that low serum selenium level during early pregnancy may not be a strong predictor of the risk of GDM and preterm birth. However, our sample size was small, and future studies with larger populations are warranted.","Liu, Peng Ju; Yao, Aimin; Ma, Liangkun; Chen, Xiao Yan; Yu, Song Lin; Liu, Yanping; Hou, Yi Xuan",Biological trace element research,207,27

This research employs preformulation studies to design an optimum dosage form for baclofen to enhance therapeutic outcomes. These studies include partition coefficient and ex-vivo permeation studies. Partition coefficient was found to be 1.27 at pH 7.4. Permeation studies confirmed the presence of specialized transport mechanism through the GIT. It was concluded that an ideal formulation of baclofen should provide slow-release of the drug to avoid sharp peaking. Modified-release floating extrudates of baclofen were prepared using Carbopol 934 and HPMC with different gas-forming agents. Different release-retarding materials (Eudragit L100, Eudragit RS100 and Cetyl alcohol) were used as ingredients in the binder solutions. The prepared extrudates were assessed for their drug content, floating ability, friability properties and in vitro release properties. The prepared extrudates recorded buoyance characteristics for 24 h with a floating lag time varying from 0 to 73.34 sec. The optimized extrudates manifested extended baclofen release for up to 8 h compared to 0.2 h for marketed baclofen tablets. This approach was found efficient to provide greater bioavailability and minimize hypotension associated with commercial baclofen tablets.","Ibrahim, Mohamed; Naguib, Youssef W; Sarhan, Hatem A; Abdelkader, Hamdy",Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,207,1

The aim of our study was to assess its implication in ARDS and its variation according to PEEP setting, considering that different cyclic stresses could alter GAS6 plasma levels. METHODS Our subjects were enrolled in the ExPress study comparing a minimal alveolar distention (low-PEEP) ventilatory strategy to a maximal alveolar recruitment (high-PEEP) strategy in ARDS. Plasma GAS6, interleukin-8 (IL-8), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels were measured at day 0 and day 3 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in blood samples prospectively collected during the study for a subset of 52 subjects included in 8 centers during year 2005. RESULTS We found that GAS6 plasma level was elevated in the whole population at day 0: median 106 ng/mL IQR 77-139 ng/mL, with significant correlations with IL-8, the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II and the Organ Dysfunction and Infection scores. Statistically significant decreases in GAS6 and IL-8 plasma levels were observed between day 0 and day 3 in the high-PEEP group (P = .02); while there were no differences between day 0 and day 3 in the low-PEEP group. CONCLUSIONS GAS6 plasma level is elevated in ARDS patients. The high-PEEP strategy is associated with a decrease in GAS6 and IL-8 plasma levels at day 3, without significant differences in day 28 mortality between the 2 groups.

Methods All emergent urological patients at Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, during the period of January 23 (the beginning of lockdown in Wuhan) to March 23, 2020, and the corresponding period in 2019 were recruited to form this study's COVID-19 group and control group, respectively. Tongji Hospital has the most concentrated and strongest Chinese medical teams to treat the largest number of severe COVID-19 patients. Patients in the control group were routinely treated, while patients in the COVID-19 group were managed following the optimized principles and strategies. The case incidence for each type of tube-related emergency was recorded. Baseline characteristics and management outcomes (surgery time, secondary complex operation rate, readmission rate, COVID-19 infection rate) were analyzed and compared across the control and COVID-19 periods. Results The total emergent urological patients during the COVID-19 period was 42, whereas during the control period, it was 124. The incidence of tube-related emergencies increased from 53% to 88% (P<0.001) during the COVID-19 period. In particular, the incidence of nephrostomy tube-related (31% vs. 15%, P=0.027) and single-J stent-related problems (19% vs. 6%, P=0.009) increased significantly. The mean surgery times across the two periods were comparable. The number of secondary complex operations increased from 12 (18%) to 14 (38%) (P=0.028) during the COVID 19-period. The number of 2-week postoperative readmission decreased from 10 (15%) to 1 (3%) (P=0.049). No participants contracted during the COVID-19 period. Conclusions Urological tube-related emergencies have been found to have a higher incidence and require more complicated and dangerous operations during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the optimized management strategies introduced in this study are efficient, and safe for both urologists and patients.","Luan, Yang; Zhang, Yan; Cui, Kai; Li, Fan; Qin, Baolong; Ruan, Yajun; Tang, Kun; Jiang, Hongyang; Li, Hao; Yuan, Xiaoyi; Liu, Zhuo; Liu, Xiaming; Yu, Gan; Xu, Shengfei; Chen, Ruibao; Yang, Huan; Guo, Xiaolin; Zeng, Xiaoyong; Chen, Zhong; Chen, Zhiqiang; Hu, Zhiquan; Song, Xiaodong; Wang, Zhihua; Wang, Shaogang; Liu, Jihong; Wang, Tao",Translational andrology and urology,207,19

We aimed to determine whether larger systolic BP (SBP) reductions were associated with better outcomes in participants of the Intensive Blood Pressure Reduction in Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage Trial (INTERACT2). INTERACT2 was an international, open, blinded end point, randomized controlled trial of patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (<6 hours) and elevated SBP (150-220 mm Hg) assigned to intensive (target SBP <140 mm Hg) or guideline-recommended (SBP <180 mm Hg) treatment. Associations of BP reduction (baseline minus average of achieved SBP) during 3 time periods post randomization (15-60 minutes, 1-24 hours, and 2-7 days) on poor outcome (death or major disability) at 90 days were analyzed in multivariable logistic regression models with odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Larger SBP reductions within the first hour after randomization were associated with lower risks of poor outcome: compared with minimal reduction (<10 mm Hg), odds ratios were 0.80 (95% confidence interval, 0.63-1.02) for moderate (10-20 mm Hg) and 0.65 (0.52-0.82) for large (≥20 mm Hg) reductions (P trend <0.01). Similar associations were also observed for SBP reductions during 1 to 24 hours (P<0.01) and 2 to 7 days (P 0.02). No heterogeneity in associations for patients above or below baseline SBP 180 mm Hg was reported (P>0.30). Optimal recovery from intracerebral hemorrhage was observed in hypertensive patients who achieved the greatest SBP reductions (≥20 mm Hg) in the first hour and maintained for 7 days.

Laryngology textbooks recommend the use of a small endotracheal tube (ETT) to help avoid these complications and optimize visualization. Case reports have suggested that the rigid stylet can lead to laryngeal injury. Given the additional risks, intubation without the stylet is our preferred practice. There is limited documentation in the literature regarding this viewpoint. Our study investigated the feasibility of and potential barriers to intubation using 5.0 ETT without a stylet. STUDY DESIGN Prospective study. METHODS Consecutive adult patients undergoing laryngeal surgery were recruited for intubation with a 5.0 ETT without a stylet. Demographic data, specialty and training level of the intubator, and factors that would predict a difficult intubation were recorded. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS Findings of the participants (n = 67) included average American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification (2.2), average Mallampati score (1.7), average Cormack-Lehane grade (1.5), and average body mass index (28.0). Five patients (7.4%) required intubation using a stylet, and one of these five participants was intubated initially with a stylet. Of these five participants, 80% required use of a GlideScope (P < .001), and they had significantly higher ASA classification (P = .047) and number of intubation attempts (P = .042). One patient sustained an oropharyngeal injury during intubation with a stylet. No participants had laryngeal injury. CONCLUSIONS Most patients can be intubated successfully using a 5.0 ETT without a stylet. There were no cases of laryngeal trauma with this technique.

We wished to describe COVID-19 intensive care patients who were treated with and without invasive ventilatory support. MATERIAL AND METHOD The material was retrieved from the local quality register and comprises data on patients with COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care department at Oslo University Hospital Ullevål from 5 March-28 May 2020. The patients were categorised in three groups on the basis of the treatment they received for respiratory failure (oxygen alone, supplemental non-invasive ventilation (NIV), and intubation/ventilator) and described using descriptive statistics. RESULTS Of 165 hospitalised COVID-19 patients, a total of 26 (16 %) were treated in our intensive care department. Four of them had do-not-resuscitate-orders and were excluded. The 22 patients included in this study had an average age of 56 years (range 25 to 78 years); 17 (77 %) were men. Eleven patients received ventilator treatment, seven oxygen by mask, and four supplemental NIV. In the ventilator group, as of 28 May 2020 two had died, and the remainder had been discharged alive from the intensive care department, with one remaining hospitalised on a ward. All patients treated with oxygen and NIV were alive and had been discharged from hospital. INTERPRETATION For many patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure and need for intensive care, increased oxygen and NIV are sufficient, but the need for intubation must be continuously assessed. More than 90 % of actively treated intensive care patients survived.","Gundem, Trine; Olasveengen, Theresa Mariero; Hovda, Knut Erik; Gaustad, Knut; Schøndorf, Christina; Rostrup, Morten; Frøyshov, Sten; Undseth, Øystein; Tonby, Kristian; Holten, Aleksander Rygh; Sunde, Kjetil","Tidsskrift for den Norske laegeforening : tidsskrift for praktisk medicin, ny raekke",207,24

Earlier identification of biomarkers for SARS can facilitate detection and reduce the mortality rate of the disease. Thus, by integrated network analysis and structural modeling approach, we aimed to explore the potential drug targets and the candidate drugs for coronavirus medicated SARS. Methods: Differentially expression (DE) analysis of CoV infected host genes (HGs) expression profiles was conducted by using the Limma. Highly integrated DE-CoV-HGs were selected to construct the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Results: Using the Walktrap algorithm highly interconnected modules include module 1 (202 nodes); module 2 (126 nodes) and module 3 (121 nodes) modules were retrieved from the PPI network. MYC, HDAC9, NCOA3, CEBPB, VEGFA, BCL3, SMAD3, SMURF1, KLHL12, CBL, ERBB4, and CRKL were identified as potential drug targets (PDTs), which are highly expressed in the human respiratory system after CoV infection. Functional terms growth factor receptor binding, c-type lectin receptor signaling, interleukin-1 mediated signaling, TAP dependent antigen processing and presentation of peptide antigen via MHC class I, stimulatory T cell receptor signaling, and innate immune response signaling pathways, signal transduction and cytokine immune signaling pathways were enriched in the modules. Protein-protein docking results demonstrated the strong binding affinity (-314.57 kcal/mol) of the ERBB4-3cLpro complex which was selected as a drug target. In addition, molecular dynamics simulations indicated the structural stability and flexibility of the ERBB4-3cLpro complex. Further, Wortmannin was proposed as a candidate drug to ERBB4 to control SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis through inhibit receptor tyrosine kinase-dependent macropinocytosis, MAPK signaling, and NF-kb singling pathways that regulate host cell entry, replication, and modulation of the host immune system. Conclusion: We conclude that CoV drug target ""ERBB4"" and candidate drug ""Wortmannin"" provide insights on the possible personalized therapeutics for emerging COVID-19.","Selvaraj, Gurudeeban; Kaliamurthi, Satyavani; Peslherbe, Gilles H; Wei, Dong-Qing",F1000Research,207,1

We also examined associations between social media and technology use and anxiety. On average, parents reported that both they and their children (especially teenagers aged 13-18) had increased technology and social media use since the beginning of social distancing. Moreover, even after controlling for demographic factors, structural equation models showed that parents and children with higher levels of anxiety (as reported by parents) were more likely to increase their technology use and use social media and phones to connect. Among parents, higher anxiety was related to using social media for both social support and information seeking. Based on these results, we advocate for the utilization of social media by public health officials for collecting, collating, and dispersing accurate crisis-related information. As social media use is widespread, and there is potential for false rumors to cause erroneous behavioral action and/or undue stress and anxiety, we also suggest that social media campaigns be thoughtfully designed to account for individual differences in developmental stages and psychological vulnerabilities.","Drouin, Michelle; McDaniel, Brandon T; Pater, Jessica; Toscos, Tammy","Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking",207,8

Patients and Methods We conducted a systematic literature search in MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science from inception to August 2020. References and abstracts were screened independently by two authors. Included studies were case reports and case series reporting endogenous TB endophthalmitis and panophthalmitis secondary to Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC). Available-case analysis was employed to handle missing data. Results A total of 1343 articles were found using the search strategy. Following abstract screening, 51 articles were selected for full text-review, from which 26 were deemed eligible for inclusion in the study. Forty-four cases from 26 articles were included in the quantitative analysis. The median age of presentation was 29.5 (range: 1 to 81), and 11/44 patients (25.0%) were pediatric. Immunosuppression was seen in 9/36 cases (25.0%). Most patients (24/38, 63.2%) had no prior history of tuberculosis. Systemic symptoms were absent in half of the patients (16/32, 50.0%). Visual acuity was poor, with 23/27 cases (85.2%) being 20/200 or worse at presentation. Poor organ and visual outcomes were reported: 36/43 cases (83.7%) resulted in enucleation/evisceration or exenteration. Intraocular tumors were suspected in 5/34 cases (14.7%). Pulmonary tuberculosis was seen in 15/35 cases (42.8%), and miliary tuberculosis was seen in 7/35 cases (20.0%). The earliest source of TB diagnosis was through histopathologic specimen after eye removal in 32/44 cases (72.7%), vitreous specimen in 6/44 cases (13.6%) and aqueous specimen in 3/44 cases (6.8%). Conclusion TB endophthalmitis is a rare and sight-threatening manifestation of ocular tuberculosis. It can occur in apparently healthy individuals and can mimic intraocular tumors and other infectious etiologies. Diagnosis remains a significant challenge, which, often delayed, leads to profound visual loss. Early detection and treatment of intraocular tuberculosis may be associated with better ocular and systemic outcomes.","Antaki, Fares; Javidi, Simon; Touma, Samir; Aubin, Marie-Josée",Clinical ophthalmology,207,24

Thus, the present research aims to investigate the impact of institutional pressures, such as human resource pressure, resources management pressure and operations management pressures, on the firm performance of the manufacturing industry in Vietnam. This research also examines the mediating impact of top management regulations among the relations of human resource pressure, resources management pressure, operations management pressures and firm performance of the manufacturing industry in Vietnam. The researchers followed the quantitative methods of data collection and used the questionnaires to obtain the data from respondents. A total of 610 questionnaires were sent to them, but only 380 were returned after three weeks and represented approximately 62.29 percent rate of response. This study also used the smart-PLS to examine the relations among the variables. The results indicated that human resource pressure, resources management pressure and operations management pressures positively associate with a firm performance of the manufacturing industry in Vietnam. The results also revealed that top management regulations positively mediate among the links of human resource pressure, resources management pressure, operations management pressures, and firm performance in Vietnam's manufacturing industry. This research has guided the regulators to increase their focus on managing institutional pressures that could enhance the firm performance. © 2021, Czestochowa University of Technology.

This study, which was commissioned by NASA headquarters, utilized satellite remote sensing data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensor onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) satellite to investigate whether these changes in activity led to any short-term changes in water quality in the Great Lakes region by comparing 2020 data to a historic baseline. The water quality parameters examined included chlorophyll-a (CHL) and total suspended solids (TSS) concentrations, water clarity, and harmful algal bloom (HAB) extent. These parameters were investigated in two Great Lakes basins which experience significant anthropogenic pressure: the western basin of Lake Erie (WBLE) and Saginaw Bay in Lake Huron (SBLH). TSS concentrations in April 2020 were below the historic baseline in both basins, and largely remained low until September. SBLH also experienced elevated CHL concentrations in April which persisted through the summer. Additionally, the WBLE HAB extent was down in 2020 after an early end to the growing season. However, this investigation found that the COVID-19 shutdowns were likely not a direct driver of these short-term anomalies. Instead, recent trends in the indicators and co-occurring anomalies in hydrological and meteorological conditions (e.g., lake temperature, river discharge, and wind speed) appeared to be more responsible for the detected water quality changes. Future work will investigate whether the shutdowns have a long-term or delayed impact on Great Lakes water quality.","Bosse, Karl R.; Sayers, Michael J.; Shuchman, Robert A.; Lekki, John Tokars Roger",Frontiers in Marine Science,207,24

The decrease in donations due to pandemic required regulation of blood supply in hospitals. In our study, we aimed to evaluate the blood center of our hospital during the pandemic period. Methods: Patients’ records of our hospital blood transfusion center were reviewed retrospectively before and during the pandemic. The patients were divided into two groups as pre-pandemic (11 March-30 June 2019) and pandemic period (11 March-30 June 2020). The groups were compared in terms of age range, gender, blood type, blood type of products, diseases causing transfusion, blood/ blood products transfusion/counts, transfusions performed to COVID-19 patients. Results: Four thousand two hundred seventy-one blood product transfusions were performed on 1, 290 patients. Evaluation of diseases that cause transfusion among statistically significant groups in some diseases such as gastrointestinal diseases, genitourinary system diseases, infectious diseases and other diseases was determined. Conclusion: While a decrease in our transfusion rates was observed during the pandemic period, the increase in gastrointestinal system diseases is a striking result. The modern world will encounter these and similar pandemics in the future and we think that each region should evaluate its own blood centers in order to prepare for them.","Yilmaz, A.; Zerde, H.

In British Columbia (BC), Canada second doses were deferred up to 16 weeks and ChAdOx1 was only initially recommended for adults 55 years of age and older. We compared single-dose vaccine effectiveness (VE) during the spring 2021 wave in BC when Alpha and Gamma variants of concern (VOC) predominated. Methods: VE was estimated against infection and hospitalization by test-negative design: cases were RT-PCR test-positive for SARS-CoV-2 and controls were test-negative. Adults 50-69 years old with specimen collection between April 4 and May 22 (weeks 14-20) were included. Variant-specific VE was estimated between weeks 17-20 when genetic characterization of all case viruses was performed, primarily through whole genome sequencing. Results: VE analyses included 7,116 (10%) cases and 60,958 controls. Three-quarters of vaccinated participants received mRNA vaccine (60% BNT162b2, 15% mRNA-1273) and 25% received ChAdOx1. Half of genetically characterized viruses were Alpha, with 38% Gamma, 4% Delta and 8% non-VOCs. Single-dose VE against any infection was 75% (95%CI: 72-78) for BNT162b2, 82% (95%CI: 76-87) for mRNA-1273 and 61% (95%CI: 54-66) for ChAdOx1. VE against hospitalization was 83% (95%CI: 76-89), 85% (95%CI: 63-94) and 96% (95%CI: 86-99), respectively. VE against Alpha vs. Gamma infections did not differ among mRNA (78%;95%CI: 73-82 and 80%;95%CI: 74-85) or ChAdOx1 (66%;95%CI: 57-74 and 60%;95%CI: 48-69) recipients. Conclusions: A single dose of mRNA vaccine reduced the SARS-CoV-2 infection risk by at least 75%, including infections due to early VOC. Although effectiveness of a single dose of ChAdOx1 was lower at 60% against infection, just one dose of any vaccine reduced the hospitalization risk by more than 80%. In the context of constrained vaccine supplies, these findings have implications for global vaccine deployment to reduce the overall burden of infections and hospitalizations due to SARS-CoV-2.","Skowronski, D.

The emergence of innovative practices that initially contributed to significantly lower rates of COVID-19 infection and mortality when compared to the city average is described. The analytical framework combines two conceptual perspectives in the study of complex systems. First, resilience in socio-ecological systems highlights the adaptation processes characterized by an interplay of previous experience and emerging new knowledge. Second, the metacontingency framework describes the interplay between a cultural milieu, as a context for cultural practices;an aggregate product;and a selecting environment that embed the acquisition and continuity of interlocking behavioral contingencies. Research methods that combine elements of the descriptive analysis and an exploratory basic qualitative study are employed to understand how the community has self-organized during this period. The findings demonstrate how previous experience with social challenges facilitated self-organization and the emergence of innovative practices in the context of uncoordinated public health measures during the pandemic in Brazil. Furthermore, findings from interviews indicate the existence of positive feedback loops at the community level that facilitated the emergence of innovative practices. This study aims at contributing to the understanding of community resilience by identifying the geographic, psychological, and ecological factors (contextual variables) that facilitate responses to the pandemic.","Bento, F.; Couto, K.

Activation of L1 in senescent cells triggers a type I interferon response and age-associated inflammation. Two open reading frames encode an ORF1 protein functioning as mRNA chaperone and an ORF2 protein providing catalytic activities necessary for retrotransposition. No function has been identified for the conserved, disordered N-terminal region of ORF1. Using microscopy and NMR spectroscopy, we demonstrate that ORF1 forms liquid droplets in vitro in a salt-dependent manner and that interactions between its N-terminal region and coiled-coil domain are necessary for phase separation. Mutations disrupting blocks of charged residues within the N-terminus impair phase separation while some mutations within the coiled-coil domain enhance phase separation. Demixing of the L1 particle from the cytosol may provide a mechanism to protect the L1 transcript from degradation. Statement of significance Over half of the human genome is comprised of repetitive sequences. The Long Interspersed Nuclear Element-1 (L1) is an autonomous mobile DNA element that can alter its genomic location, resulting in genomic instability and DNA damage. L1 encodes two proteins that are required for this function: the ORF1 RNA chaperone and the enzymatic ORF2. Here, we demonstrate that ORF1 forms liquid-liquid phase separated states in vitro, which is mediated by electrostatic interactions between the conserved, disordered N-terminus and coiled-coil domain. This work provides a framework to explore how L1 phase separation may enhance the ability of the retrotransposable element to colonize the genome by preventing degradation of the L1 transcript and evasion of host immune responses.","Newton, JC; Li, GY; Naik, MT; Fawzi, NL; Sedivy, JM; Jogl, G",bioRxiv,207,16

Development of broadly effective coronavirus vaccines that can mitigate these threats is needed 8,9. Notably, several recent studies have revealed that vaccination of recovered COVID-19 donors results in enhanced nAb responses compared to SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination alone 10–13. Here, we utilized a targeted donor selection strategy to isolate a large panel of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) to sarbecoviruses from two such donors. Many of the bnAbs are remarkably effective in neutralization against sarbecoviruses that use ACE2 for viral entry and also show strong binding to non-ACE2-using sarbecoviruses. The bnAbs are equally effective against SARS-CoV-2 VOCs compared to the original virus. Neutralization breadth is achieved by bnAb binding to epitopes on a relatively conserved face of the receptor binding domain (RBD) as opposed to strain-specific nAbs to the receptor binding site that are commonly elicited in SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination 14–18. The generation of a large panel of potent bnAbs provides new opportunities and choices for next-generation antibody prophylactic and therapeutic applications and, importantly, provides a basis for effective design of pan-sarbecovirus vaccines.","He, Wan-ting; Musharrafieh, Rami; Song, Ge; Dueker, Katharina; Callaghan, Sean; Yong, Peter; Beutler, Nathan; Torres, Jonathan L.; Volk, Reid M.; Zhou, Panpan; Yuan, Meng; Liu, Hejun; Anzanello, Fabio; Parren, Mara; Garcia, Elijah; Rawlings, Stephen A.; Smith, Davey M.; Wilson, Ian A.; Ward, Andrew B.; Rogers, Thomas F.; Burton, Dennis R.; Andrabi, Raiees",bioRxiv,207,16

This pandemic necessitated the development of protective and therapeutic measures against the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Foods containing representatives of the genus Lactobacillus are an integral part of the daily menu of the Bulgarian people. Our hypothesis is based on studies examining its potential for competitive inhibition of viruses and bacteria by attachment to the surface of enterocytes. Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is an integral part of the vaccination calendar in the Republic of Bulgaria. In the literature, many clinical studies show that the administration of BCG vaccine limits the SARS-CoV-2 antigens and, consequently, is able to induce protection for COVID-19, by activating the specific, innate immune system. The lack of definitively approved treatment necessitates finding ways to limit the spread of COVID-19 until final drug approval. We believe that the use of dietary components in the context of competitive inhibition and the vaccination schedule for protection in coronavirus-related diseases is applicable.

The transmission of the virus from the origin to humans is not known yet, but its rapid transmission from human to human has been widely confirmed. The virus increases the risk of mortality in people with a history of heart disease, diabetes, kidney problems and high blood pressure. Researchers found that the mortality rate is higher in men than women and elderly male patients above 60 are also at high risk. To date, no effective and approved antiviral medicine or vaccine is available for use against COVID-19. Therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend that humans should protect themselves and prevent the spread of the virus by taking personal hygiene, keeping a distance from people infected with the virus, and even quarantine.

In the Department of Infectious and Allergic Eye Diseases of the Helmholts National Medical Research Center of Eye Diseases, 88 patients with confirmed transferred new coronavirus infection COVID-19 of varying severity were observed. The main method of laboratory diagnostics is the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in swabs from the nasopharynx, the patient's sputum. Serodiagnostics of COVID-19 includes the determination of IgG-, IgM-antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in the blood in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results. Acute conjunctivitis associated with COVID-19 is quite rare and is an early sign of the disease. In the complex nonspecific topical therapy of viral conjunctivitis in COVID-19, along with etiopathogenetic systemic treatment, local eye medications with immunomodulatory and antiviral activity should be used. Conjunctivitis during a pandemic may be the only sign of COVID-19. The development of allergic conjunctivitis in COVID-19 is possibly associated not only with the effect of a viral agent, but also depends on the toxic effect of drugs used in the complex treatment of this disease. The increase in the number of patients with episcleritis after the postponed coronavirus infection needs further detailed study, with the analysis of laboratory data from this group of patients and the accumulation of clinical material. Conclusion. Ophthalmic manifestations in COVID-19 are very different, affecting various structures of the eye, occur at different periods - both during the course of the disease and after clinical recovery, and, of course, need further consideration, study and structuring. © 2021 Ophthalmology Publishing Group.

Yet, connecting these relationships to population growth, especially for multiple populations within a species, is lacking and precludes our understanding of how amphibians are distributed. Therefore, we constructed Integral Projection Models (IPM) for five populations along an elevational gradient to determine how climate and season affects population growth of a terrestrial salamander Plethodon montanus and the importance of demographic vital rates to population growth under varying climate scenarios. We found that population growth was typically higher at the highest elevation compared to the lower elevations whereas varying inactive season conditions, represented by the late fall, winter and early spring, produced a greater variation in population growth than varying active season conditions (late spring, summer, and early fall). Furthermore, survival and growth was consistently more important, as measured by elasticity, compared to fecundity and large females had the greatest elasticity compared to all other sizes. Our results suggest that changing inactive season conditions, especially those that would affect the survival of large individuals, may have the greatest impact on population growth. Therefore, we recommend experimental studies focused on the inactive season to determine the mechanism by which these conditions can affect survival.","Caruso, Nicholas M.; Staudhammer, Christina L.; Rissler, Leslie J.",bioRxiv,207,24

Behind its advantages, e-money has been influenced by the inflation rate, thus accelerating the country's money circulation. Moreover, the fragile Covid-19 economy triggers each country's need to anticipate the circulation of e-money to deter future inflation. Therefore, this paper deployed the Backpropagation approach integrated with the Genetic Algorithm to forecast the dissemination of e-money in Indonesia by exploiting time-series Bank Indonesia (BI) data from January 2009 to December 2019. Here, 120 data with 12 variables are considered to thoroughly predict the Year 2020 circulation focusing on the previous 12 months. This study reveals that e-money circulation in Indonesia is increasing monthly in 2020. The testing result shows that the lowest mean square error (MSE) is found at 0.000035 for data training division at 90%:10%, learning rate parameter at 0.8, the combination of crossover probability and mutation at 0.4:0.6, and the total generation and population at 350 and 200, respectively.

A major cause of morbidity among patients with SCD is the occurrence of severely painful episodes, known as vaso-occlusive crisis (VOCs), which can impact quality of life and cause organ damage or even death. This study assessed the impact of VOC events on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and associated utility of patients with SCD. Methods: The LEGACY registry (CICL670AUS38) is a prospective, multicenter, observational study that documented the outcomes of 498 SCD patients living in the United States. For the cohort of 181 adult patients (≥18 years), Short Form-36 (SF-36) Health Survey scores and VOCs were evaluated every 6 months for 3 years or until patient discontinuation. SF-36 scores were mapped to the EuroQoL five-dimension (EQ-5D) questionnaire. For each patient, the annualized rate of VOC events was calculated from first visit to each visit with HRQoL measures reported, and annualized VOC rates were subsequently grouped (<1, ≥1 to <3, ≥3 VOCs/year). Mean EQ-5D scores were compared between annualized VOC groups using generalized estimating equations to account for within-patient correlation across visits. Differences between the groups on the SF-36 component scores and SF-36 domains were also assessed. Results: Patients with ≥3 VOCs/year reported, on average, a mapped EQ-5D score 0.0697 lower (p = 0.014) than patients with <1 VOCs/year (0.6213 vs. 0.6910). Furthermore, patients who had ≥3 VOCs/year also showed, on average, a SF-36 Physical Component Score 2.480 lower (p = 0.025) compared to patients with <1 VOCs/year (48.684 vs. 51.164). Conclusions: This analysis demonstrates the long-term impact of VOC frequency on HRQoL. SCD patients who had a higher number of annual VOCs were shown to have a worse HRQoL compared to patients with <1 VOCs/year.","Bailey, M.; Bonner, A.; Brown, S.; Thompson, M.",Value in Health,207,20

A total of 10 years of data have been accumulated from the reactive gas and greenhouse gas detectors and the aerosol analyzers found at this Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) regional station. The data has been evaluated, resulting in trends in emissions from shipping recorded within the same region coming to the fore. The other source of emissions that was evident within the recorded data originated from Mt. Etna, located on the island of Sicily and representing the highest active volcano in Europe. The aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of ship emissions on trace gases and aerosol background measurements at Giordan Lighthouse, including the putative influence of COVID-19 on the same emissions. The model used to evaluate ship emissions was the Ship Traffic Emission Assessment Model (STEAM). From trace gas measurements at Giordan Lighthouse, a slowly decreasing trend in sulfur oxide (SOx) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions was noted. To better understand the air quality results obtained, the STEAM model was fed, as an input, an Automatic Identification System (AIS) dataset to describe the vessel activity in the area concerned.

The main treatment regimen currently in use requires a lumbar puncture as part of the diagnostic process to determine disease stage and hospital admission for drug administration. Fexinidazole is a new oral treatment for stage 1 and non-severe stage 2 human African trypanosomiasis. The World Health Organization has recently incorporated fexinidazole into its treatment guidelines for human African trypanosomiasis. The treatment does not require hospital admission or a lumbar puncture for all patients, which is likely to ease access for patients; however, it does require concomitant food intake, which is likely to reduce adherence. Here, we use a mathematical model calibrated to case and screening data from Mushie territory, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to explore the potential negative impact of poor compliance to an oral treatment, and potential gains to be made from increases in the rate at which patients seek treatment. We find that reductions in compliance in treatment of stage 1 cases are projected to result in the largest increase in further transmission of the disease, with failing to cure stage 2 cases also posing a smaller concern. Reductions in compliance may be offset by increases in the rate at which cases are passively detected. Efforts should therefore be made to ensure good adherence for stage 1 patients to treatment with fexinidazole and to improve access to passive care.","Das, A. M.; Chitnis, N.; Burri, C.; Paris, D.

In the alphavirus structural polyprotein, -1PRF is coordinated by a “slippery” sequence in the transcript, an RNA stem-loop, and a conformational transition in the nascent polypeptide chain. To characterize each of these effectors, we measured the effects of 4,530 mutations on -1PRF by deep mutational scanning. While most mutations within the slip-site and stem-loop disrupt -1PRF, mutagenic effects upstream of the slip-site are far more variable. Molecular dynamics simulations of polyprotein biogenesis suggest many of these mutations alter stimulatory forces on the nascent chain through their effects on translocon-mediated cotranslational folding. Finally, we provide evidence suggesting the coupling between cotranslational folding and -1PRF depends on the translation kinetics upstream of the slip-site. These findings demonstrate how -1PRF is coordinated by features within both the transcript and nascent chain.","Carmody, Patrick J.; Zimmer, Matthew H.; Kuntz, Charles P.; Harrington, Haley R.; Duckworth, Kate E.; Penn, Wesley D.; Mukhopadhyay, Suchetana; Miller, Thomas F.; Schlebach, Jonathan P.",bioRxiv,207,1

Here, we report a super-spreading transmission chain of SARS-CoV-2 involving an index patient, seven cancer patients, 40 health care workers and four family members. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study to identify the index patient and the exposed individuals linked to a chain of transmission associated with COVID-19. We collected and analyzed the data on demographic features, exposure history, clinical presentation, laboratory investigation, radiological examination, and disease outcome of these patients. Results: We identified the index patient and another presumptive super-spreader, who initiated and amplified a super-spreading transmission chain associated with COVID-19, respectively. There were 31 female and 21 male patients in this cohort, and the median age was 37 years (range: 22-79 years). Each of them had an exposure history with the index patient or his close contacts. Approximately 87% (45/52) of the patients had fever or other symptoms, 96% (50/52) had abnormal chest CT-scan findings, 86% of the tested patients (39/45) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the nasopharyngeal or throat swab specimen, 85% of the tested patients (29/34) were positive for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and/or IgG, 15% of the RT-PCR positive patients were tested negative for the specific IgM and/or IgG at the convalescent phase, and 15% of the RT-PCR negative patients were tested positive for the specific IgM and/or IgG. The severe patients experienced a significant decrease in oximetry saturation, lymphocyte, and platelet counts, along with a significant increase in C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and lactate dehydrogenase. All six fatal cases had comorbidities and five of the seven cancer patients (71%) died within 2-20 days of the disease onset. Conclusions: The super-spreading events were associated with the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan and its impact on disease transmission warrants further investigation. Cancer patients appeared highly vulnerable to COVID-19. The finding that a significant portion of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were tested negative for the serum specific IgM and IgG at the convalescent phase should be addressed by additional studies.","Hu, Ke; Zhao, Yang; Wang, Mengmei; Zeng, Qiqi; Wang, Xiaorui; Wang, Ming; Zheng, Zhishui; Li, Xiaochen; Zhang, Yunting; Wang, Tao; Zeng, Shaolin; Jiang, Yan; Liu, Dan; Yu, Wenzhen; Hu, Fang; Qin, Hongyu; Hao, Jingcan; Yuan, Jian; Shang, Rui; Jiang, Meng; Ding, Xi; Zhang, Binghong; Shi, Bingyin; Zhang, Chengsheng",,207,1

The first sensor was made of the piezoelectric membrane, and the second uses conductive elastic rubber that changes its resistance when stretched. Both sensors were placed on the patient's chest using a specially designed for this purpose belt.Simultaneous biomedical signals were recorded in laboratory conditions for various measurement methods, which showed chest movement during breathing in healthy people with the simulation of difficult measurement conditions, such as shallow and rapid breathing, slow deep breathing combined with apnea, and in the presence of motor disturbances. The obtained results for both measurement methods allow confirming a satisfactory immunity to movement disturbances and correct detection in extreme measurement conditions such as fast and shallow breathing and apnea while the piezoelectric method, enables recording with better resolution in conditions of fast and shallow breathing. Both piezoelectric and resistive methods are correct for creating sensors that monitor basic patients' respiratory parameters. Their additional advantage is the simplicity and low cost of production which may be important in examining geriatric patients and neonates however piezoelectric is cheaper and less burdensome during the long-term recording of respiratory parameters. © 2021 Lodz University of Technology.","Karpiel, I.; Woloszyn, J.; Olesz, K.; Mysinski, M.; Urzeniczok, M.; Feige, D.; Sobotnicki, A.; Czerw, M.","28th International Conference on Mixed Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems, MIXDES 2021",207,12

We obtained monthly demographic and mortality information of the TDCJ population from April 1, 2019 to March 31, 2021 from TDCJ monthly reports and open record requests filed by the Texas Justice Initiative. We estimated the risk of COVID-19 mortality for the Hispanic and Black population relative to the White population using a Bayesian regression framework, adjusting for sex and age. In the first 12 months of the pandemic, Hispanic and Black all-cause mortality rates were higher than that of the White population, reversing the pattern observed the 12 months prior. Adjusted risk of COVID-19 mortality relative to the White population was 1.96 (CI 1.32-2.93) for the Hispanic population and 1.66 (CI 1.10-2.52) for the Black population. We find that COVID-19 related mortality has disproportionately impacted Hispanic and Black individuals within the TDCJ population. As the proximal mechanisms which drive these inequalities are likely different than those which lead to racial inequalities in the non-incarcerated populations, future studies should look to assess and address the specific drivers of COVID-19 related disparities in carceral settings.","Marquez, N.; Moreno, D.; Klonsky, A.; Dolovich, S.",,207,12

It is composed of five layers: epithelium, Bowman’s layer, stroma, Descemet’s membrane and endothelium. The maintenance of its structure and transparency are determined by the functions of the different cell types populating each layer. Attempts to regenerate corneal tissue and understand disease conditions requires knowledge of how cell profiles vary across this heterogeneous tissue. We performed a single cell transcriptomic profiling of 19,472 cells isolated from eight healthy donor corneas. Our analysis delineates the heterogeneity of the corneal layers by identifying cell populations and revealing cell states that contribute in preserving corneal homeostasis. We identified that the expression of CAV1, CXCL14, HOMER3 and CPVL were exclusive to the corneal epithelial limbal stem cell niche, CKS2, STMN1 and UBE2C were exclusively expressed in highly proliferative transit amplifying cells, and NNMT was exclusively expressed by stromal keratocytes. Overall, this research provides a basis to improve current primary cell expansion protocols, for future profiling of corneal disease states, to help guide pluripotent stem cells into different corneal lineages, and to understand how engineered substrates affect corneal cells to improve regenerative therapies.","Català, Pere; Groen, Nathalie; Dehnen, Jasmin A.; Soares, Eduardo; van Velthoven, Arianne J.H.; Nuijts, Rudy M.M.A.; Dickman, Mor M.; LaPointe, Vanessa L.S.",bioRxiv,207,25

Obviously, most people would like to get a secure information related to their health. Therefore, with the recent growth of cloud computing privacy and data protection requirements have been evolving toto protect individuals from surveillance and data leakage. However, due to security concerns about frequent data breaches and recently upgraded legal data protection requirements (such as the EU's General Data Protection Regulation), it is recommended not to outsourcing unprotected sensitive data to public clouds. Cloud computing offers on-demand services including platforms, infrastructure and software that have been developed. To ensure confidentiality, the encryption algorithm is the most commonly used technique. However, Using a single algorithm is not effective for the high-level security of data in cloud computing. To fix this issue, we have introduced a new security mechanism using a built-in encrypted cloud storage system, which makes the proposed system strong against vulnerabilities. Various symmetric and asymmetric encryption techniques have been used to protect data from external threats. These techniques can help restrict the access to the stored data in order to be available for authorized users only. Combining Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Cryptographic Curve Cryptography (ECC), the sensitive files are stored in client side and uploaded to the server. The results show that the impact of this built-in approach is more important than the other secure algorithms. In addition, it also showed that in the built-in algorithm, adding additional layers of security did not cause an increase in the download and upload time from and to the cloud. © 2021 IEEE.","Shakor, M.

The process uses electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and base composition analysis of PCR amplification products from highly conserved genomic regions to identify and determine the relative quantity of pathogenic bacteria present in the sample. High-resolution genotyping of specific species is achieved by using additional primers targeted to highly variable regions of specific bacterial genomes. This method was used to examine samples taken from military recruits during respiratory disease outbreaks and for follow up surveillance at several military training facilities. Analysis of respiratory samples revealed high concentrations of pathogenic respiratory species, including Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. When S. pyogenes was identified in samples from the epidemic site, the identical genotype was found in almost all recruits.

Although these proteins likely are essential for viral replication, their specific roles in SARS-CoV entry have not been defined. In this report, we show that the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein mediates viral entry through pH-dependent endocytosis. Further, we define its cellular tropism and demonstrate that virus transmission occurs through cell-mediated transfer by dendritic cells. The S glycoprotein was used successfully to pseudotype replication-defective retroviral and lentiviral vectors that readily infected Vero cells as well as primary pulmonary and renal epithelial cells from human, nonhuman primate, and, to a lesser extent, feline species. The tropism of this reporter virus was similar to that of wild-type, replication-competent SARS-CoV, and binding of purified S to susceptible target cells was demonstrated by flow cytometry. Although myeloid dendritic cells were able to interact with S and to bind virus, these cells could not be infected by SARS-CoV. However, these cells were able to transfer the virus to susceptible target cells through a synapse-like structure. Both cell-mediated infection and direct infection were inhibited by anti-S antisera, indicating that strategies directed toward this gene product are likely to confer a therapeutic benefit for antiviral drugs or the development of a SARS vaccine.","Yang, Zhi-Yong; Huang, Yue; Ganesh, Lakshmanan; Leung, Kwanyee; Kong, Wing-Pui; Schwartz, Owen; Subbarao, Kanta; Nabel, Gary J",Journal of virology,207,1

Late preterm infants (LPIs, 34(0/7) to 36(6/7) weeks' gestational age) are at the greatest risk for failure, despite often being well. OBJECTIVE To determine the incidence of car seat testing failure in LPIs and associative factors. METHODS A retrospective chart review was performed of inborn LPIs admitted to all levels of newborn care between July 1, 2012 and June 30, 2013. Data collected included maternal demographics, labour and delivery history, and neonatal course. Data were analyzed using backward logistic regression. RESULTS A total of 511 charts were reviewed and 367 LPIs were eligible for inclusion. Of the 313 LPIs tested (mean [± SD] gestational age 36 weeks ±6 days and birth weight 2614±405 g), 80 (26%) failed (95% CI 21% to 31%). Most failed due to desaturations (≥2) of <88% for ≥10 s (n=33 [41%]). Multiple gestation was associated with failure (adjusted OR 2.45 [95% CI 1.44 to 4.18]; P=0.001), and there was a trend toward statistical significance for the variable postnatal age (0.996 [95% CI 0.99 to 1.00]; P=0.05). Infants who passed their car seat test had higher postnatal ages than those who failed (mean difference 39.4 h [95% CI 12.7 h to 66.0 h]; P=0.004). CONCLUSION Twenty-six percent of LPIs failed car seat testing. Ideally, infants should be tested after an appropriate transitional period. The authors identified factors that may be important in designing future, prospective studies in this area. Future research should evaluate the clinical significance of car seat testing and resource utilization.","Smith, Ryan W; Mohamed, Adel; Young, Jennifer; Jefferies, Ann; Shah, Vibhuti",Paediatrics & child health,207,9

The foundation of our treatment strategy was the triad of alpha-2 agonists (clonidine, dexmedetomidine, guanfacine), antipsychotic agents (quetiapine, haloperidol, olanzapine), and melatonin. Discharge planning required involvement from inpatient psychiatry, case management, social work, and the family. Both patients showed improvement after several weeks. DISCUSSION We believe these are the first reported cases of COVID-19-associated delirium in children outside of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).

The clinical features of patients with ARF were characterized, and the etiologies analyzed. RESULTS Patients were assigned to ARF (n = 13; 17%) and non-ARF groups (n = 65). Patients with ARF were older than their non-ARF counterparts. ARF developed 7.2 +/- 4.3 days after admission. The incidence of ARF was higher in males (77% vs 35%; p < 0.05). Comorbidities of diabetes and heart failure were more common in patients who developed ARF (38% vs 6%, p < 0.01 and 38% vs 2%, p < 0.001, respectively) and the incidence of respiratory failure (85% vs 26%, p < 0.001) and mortality (77% vs 8%, p < 0.001) were also higher. Multiple organ system failure usually accompanied ARF. Hypotension (77%) caused by nosocomial infections, gastrointestinal bleeding, or SARS per se, and rhabdomyolysis (43%) was associated with ARF in addition to pre-renal factors. Five patients in the ARF group and 1 female patient with end-stage renal failure underwent renal replacement therapy during hospitalization; however, both eventually died. Of the 16 medical staff performing renal replacement therapy, none was subsequently infected with SARS coronavirus. CONCLUSIONS Development of ARF during the disease course in SARS patients is associated with catastrophic outcome. The cause of ARF in SARS patients is often associated with pre-renal factors, hypotension, rhabdomyolysis, and previous comorbidities including diabetes and old age. Universal precautions to prevent viral transmission are mandatory for medical staff performing renal replacement therapy.","Huang, Jenq-Wen; Chen, Kuan-Yu; Tsai, Hung-Bin; Wu, Vin-Cent; Yang, Ya-Fei; Wu, Ming-Shiou; Chu, Tzong-Shinn; Wu, Kwan-Dun",Journal of the Formosan Medical Association = Taiwan yi zhi,207,16

It is commonly expected that the growing ability to detect and characterize trace proteins will result in discovery of novel therapeutics and biomarkers; however, the familiar, super-abundant plasma proteins remain a fundamental stumbling block. Furthermore, robust validation of proteomic data is a sometimes overlooked but always necessary component for the eventual development of clinical reagents.

Increases in quinolone resistance have followed loss of the penicillins and tetracyclines as useful treatments. Decreasing susceptibility to third-generation cephalosporins is also reported. Over-reliance on antibiotic treatment as a disease control measure in settings with high disease rates and poor control of antibiotic usage is a significant contributor to the antimicrobial resistance reported. Conversely, containment of resistance is more likely to be achieved when combined with disease control principles shown to be effective. However, until a higher priority is given to funding for sexually transmitted diseases, this prospect is unlikely to eventuate and the possibility of untreatable gonorrhea becomes more real.","Tapsall, John",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,207,17

Questions added for this study concerned respondents' knowledge of, worry about, and support of stigmatizing actions to control AIDS and SARS. RESULTS In general, respondents with greater personal resources (income, education, social support) and better mental health status had more knowledge, were less worried, and were less likely to stigmatize. This pattern held for both AIDS and SARS. CONCLUSIONS Personal resources and mental health factors are likely to influence the public's ability to learn about, rationally appraise the threat of, and minimize stigmatization of emerging infectious diseases such as AIDS and SARS.","Des Jarlais, Don C; Galea, Sandro; Tracy, Melissa; Tross, Susan; Vlahov, David",American journal of public health,207,28

Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) have been evaluated for detecting most respiratory pathogens, and commercial assays are available for some pathogens. However, standardized protocols are needed before these assays are introduced into routine diagnostic use. For pneumonia, NAATs offer advantages over conventional tests for the detection of Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella spp. and Chlamydia pneumoniae. For pneumococcal pneumonia in adults, PCR adds little to existing diagnostic tests, and is unable to distinguish pneumococcal colonization from infection when testing respiratory samples. Although less sensitive than culture-based methods, several commercial molecular diagnostic assays have been developed for tuberculosis and are useful rapid tests for selected patients. PCR can now be considered the rapid diagnostic test of choice for pertussis and some respiratory virus infections. Further work is required to better characterize the role of molecular diagnostic tests for diagnosing lower respiratory tract infections, and to develop standard assays that can be readily adopted by routine diagnostic laboratories.","Murdoch, David R","APMIS : acta pathologica, microbiologica, et immunologica Scandinavica",207,1

METHOD Dynamic changes of chest X-ray images and laboratory tests in 45 SARS patients managed from March to May, 2003 were analyzed. RESULTS (1) Chest X-ray image: among 45 cases, 23 were common type: the time to appearance of unilateral patched shadow of the lung were 2 to 5 (2.9 +/- 1.0) days. The time to appearance of bilateral patched shadow of the lungs were 2 to 12 (6.9 +/- 2.5) days. The time to appearance of ground glass or consolidation in the lung were 6 to 19 (11.0 +/- 2.0) days. The time to the beginning of absorption of X-ray changes were 10 to 21 (15.0 +/- 4.1) days. The time for chest X-ray image to be absorbed completely were 18 to 46 (25.9 +/- 7.2) days. Twenty-two patients were severe type, in which the time to the appearance of ground glass of the lung were (9.0 +/- 3.2) days, with no significant difference when compared with common type (P < 0.05). However, the time to the beginning of absorption and complete absorption were (19.0 +/- 4.6) days (P = 0.009) and (36.0 +/- 8.1) days (P = 0.001), respectively. Noticeably, the time to pan-consolidation of the lung were less than 7 days in 7 fatal cases. (2) Laboratory tests: decrease in the number of lymphocytes and T lymphocyte subset were seen in the early stage. While the account recovered in 10 to 14 days of disease course in the 38 patients who survived, there was no recovery in 7 patients who died. CONCLUSIONS SARS can be divided into five stages: incubation period 2 to 10 days, prodromal period 1 to 3 days, progressive period 4 to 7 days, advanced period 8 to 15 days were, convalescent period 16 to 24 days. The appearance of pan-consolidation in the lung in less than 7 days and/or unable to recover the number of lymphocytes and T lymphocyte subset will be associated with poor prognosis.","Guo, Xin-hui; Zhang, Ke; Zhao, Da-wei; Zhang, Tian-ge; Guo, Yan-bin",Zhonghua nei ke za zhi,207,5

Little is known, however, about the impact of indefinite deferral of transfused donors on blood safety and availability in the US. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Data were collected on allogeneic donations at five US blood centers during 1991 through 2000. Donation characteristics, prevalence, and incidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) were compared between transfused and nontransfused donors. Unreported deferrable risk (UDR) and reasons to donate were evaluated with data from a mail survey. RESULTS Transfusion history was reported by 4.2 percent of donors. Prevalence and incidence of HIV and HBV were comparable between transfused and nontransfused donors. Although HCV incidence was similar in both groups, HCV prevalence was nearly three times higher in transfused than in nontransfused first-time donors. UDR and reasons to donate were similar in the two groups, except transfused donors were less likely to donate for screening test results (odds ratio, 0.5; 95% confidence interval, 0.3-0.8). CONCLUSION Transfused and nontransfused donors had similar viral incidence and comparable UDR, suggesting that indefinite deferral of transfused donors would unlikely improve blood safety. Until more is known about the prevalence and transfusion transmissibility of emerging agents, indefinite deferral of previously transfused donors in the US does not appear warranted.","Wang, B; Higgins, M J; Kleinman, S; Schreiber, G B; Murphy, E L; Glynn, S A; Wright, D J; Nass, C C; Chang, D; Busch, M P",Transfusion,207,24

The stability of chelonian herpesviruses in the marine environment, which may influence transmission, has not been previously studied. In these experiments, LETD-associated herpesvirus (LETV) was used as a model chelonian herpesvirus to test viral infectivity after exposure to seawater. The LETV virus preparations grown in terrapene heart (TH-1) cells were dialyzed for 24 to 120 hr against aerated artificial or natural seawater or Hank's balanced salt solution (HBBS). Fresh TH-1 cells were inoculated with dialyzed LETV, and on day 10 post-infection cells were scored for cytopathic effect. Virus samples dialyzed up to 120 hr were positive for the herpesvirus DNA polymerase gene by polymerase chain reaction. Electron microscopy revealed intact LETV nucleocapsids after exposure of LETV to artificial seawater or HBSS for 24 hr at 23 C. LETV preparations remained infectious as long as 120 hr in natural and artificial seawater at 23 C. Similar results were obtained with a second culturable chelonian herpesvirus, HV2245. LETV infectivity could not be detected after 48 hr exposure to artificial seawater at 30 C. Since LETV and HV2245 remain infectious for extended periods of time in the marine environment, it is possible that FP-associated and GPD-associated herpesviruses also may be stable. These findings are significant both for researchers studying the epidemiological association of herpesviruses with diseases of marine turtles and for individuals who handle turtles in marine turtle conservation efforts.","Curry, S S; Brown, D R; Gaskin, J M; Jacobson, E R; Ehrhart, L M; Blahak, S; Herbst, L H; Klein, P A",Journal of wildlife diseases,207,4

SARS has caused an outbreak in the world during 2003 and 2004, with 8098 individuals being infected and a death toll of 774 in 28 regions around the world. Specific humoral responses to viral infection remain unclear. OBJECTIVE To analyse the antigenicity of the SARS-CoV genome and identify potential antigenic epitopes in the structural proteins. METHODS Potential antigenic epitopes were identified in the structural proteins (nucleocapsid, membrane, spike, and small envelope proteins) and hypothetical proteins (SARS3a, 3b, 6, 7a, and 9b) that are specific for SARS-CoV. A peptide chip platform was created and the profiles of antibodies to these epitopes were investigated in 59 different SARS patients' sera obtained 6-103 days after the onset of the illness. Serial sera from five additional patients were also studied. RESULTS Epitopes at the N-terminus of the membrane protein and the C-terminus of nucleocapsid protein elicited strong antibody responses. Epitopes on the spike protein were only moderately immunogenic but the effects were persistent. Antibodies were also detected for some putative proteins, noticeably the C-termini of SARS3a and SARS6. CONCLUSIONS Important epitopes of the SARS-CoV genome that may serve as potential markers for the viral infection are identified. These specific antigenic sites may also be important for vaccine development against this new fatal infectious disease.","Chow, S C S; Ho, C Y S; Tam, T T Y; Wu, C; Cheung, T; Chan, P K S; Ng, M H L; Hui, P K; Ng, H K; Au, D M Y; Lo, A W I",Journal of clinical pathology,207,24

An alternative is to supply plain alcohols (EtOH and IPA) or sodium hypochlorite (SH). AIM: There are few data showing the efficacy of multiple concentrations of EtOH, IPA, and SH on a human coronavirus (HCoV) dried on surfaces using short contact times. METHODS: Multiple concentrations of EtOH, IPA, and SH to inactivate high numbers of HCoV under real-life conditions were tested. High concentrations of infectious HCoV were dried on porcelain and ceramic tiles, then treated with multiple concentrations of the alcohols for contact times of 15 sec, 30 sec, and 1 min. Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommended three concentrations of SH were also tested. Reductions in titres were measured by using the tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50) assay. FINDINGS: Concentrations of EtOH and IPA from 62% to 80% were very efficient at inactivating high numbers of HCoV dried on tile surfaces even with a 15 sec contact time. Concentrations of 95% dehydrated the virus, allowing infectious virus to survive. The CDC recommended 1/10 and 1/50 dilutions of SH were efficient at inactivating high numbers of HCoV dried on tile surfaces, whereas, a 1/100 dilution had substantially lower activity. CONCLUSIONS: EtOH, IPA, and SH at multiple concentrations efficiently inactivated infectious virus on hard surfaces, typical of those found in public places. Often no remaining infectious HCoV could be detected.","Meyers, Craig; Kass, Rena; Goldenberg, David; Milici, Janice; Alam, Samina; Robison, Richard",J. hosp. infect,207,22

However, unavoidable inhomogeneities inherent to any material leads to pinning or repulsion of skyrmions that, in analogy to biology concepts, define the phenotype of the skyrmion-defect interaction, generating complexity in their motion and challenging their application as future bits of information. Here, we demonstrate that atom-by-atom manufacturing of multi-atomic defects, being antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic, permits the breeding of their energy profiles, for which we build schematically a Punnet-square. As established from first-principles for skyrmions generated in PdFe bilayer on Ir(111) surface, the resulting interaction phenotype is rich. It can be opposite to the original one and eventually be of dual pinning-repulsive nature yielding energy landscapes hosting multi-domains. This is dictated by the stacking site, geometry, size and chemical nature of the adsorbed defects, which control the involved magnetic interactions. This work provides new insights towards the development of disruptive device architectures incorporating defects into their design aiming to control and guide skyrmions.","Arjana, I Gede; Lima Fernandes, Imara; Chico, Jonathan; Lounis, Samir",Sci Rep,207,1

As a result, education could no longer be provided in its current form and was therefore provided online. This study discusses the consequences of online instruction in secondary education and how students perceived this new way of learning. Specifically, this research focuses on how online education was facilitated, how this differs from regular education and how students and teachers experienced these practices. In this study, qualitative and quantitative data were collected from teachers and students. Our findings revealed that the students were missing a proper structure in the lessons. There was a decline in the understanding and enjoyment by students in all courses. This study also shows that the variety of instructional strategies that the teachers used increased during the lockdown period. However, teachers were lacking in other aspects that define good instruction. Moreover, teacher data demonstrate that the teachers needed guidance from the schoolboard. It is remarkable that the schoolboard plays a key role in improving this situation. This research suggests that if the schoolboard provides guidelines on planning education, teachers could focus more on other aspects of a good instruction.","Lauret, Dirk Bayram-Jacobs Durdane",Education Sciences,207,24

SARS-CoV-2 causes the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Many of country are reporting the symptomatic characteristics of their cases to give better observations into the various clinical presentations of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the symptomatic literature is limited in Bangladesh. The aim of the study is to analyze the symptomatic characteristics of patients having the SARS-CoV-2 positive by real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT -PCR) test. Here, the data of 146 patients who were positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus and were residents of different districts of Mymensingh region were analyzed. Patients' demographics, symptoms, history of co-morbidities condition like DM, HTN, Hypothyroid etc, travel and contact were collected from MMC Daily Reported data from April 1, 2020 to April 30, 2020. Among the total 3184 patients' nasopharyngeal samples, we have got 146 (4.58%) positive for SARS-CoV-2.

In this context, an early and rapid diagnosis of infected patients that do not require expensive equipment or highly trained personnel is crucial in order to reduce the contagious rate. The aim of this study was to evaluate a chromatographic immunoassay's performance for the rapid diagnosis of SARS-CoV-antigen. METHODS: A cross-sectional study included 369 adults from Western México with diagnosis or suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Two samples were collected; a naso-oropharyngeal was used for a molecular determination of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The molecular analysis was carried out using DeCoV19 Kit Triplex (Genes2life S.A.P.I.) based on the CDC diagnostic panel for N1, N2, and N3 regions. The second sample was retrieved from a nasopharyngeal rub and used for the rapid diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 antigen employing the commercial STANDARD&#8482; Q COVID-19 Ag Test (SD BIOSENSOR). RESULTS: Overall, in 28.2% of the patients was detected the SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and 21.4% were positive for antigen detection. The rapid antigen test showed a sensitivity and specificity of 75.9% and 100%, respectively, with a positive predictive and negative values of 100% and 91%. Symptoms as anosmia presented a high OR for the positive diagnosis for both test, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and the rapid antigen test of 8.86 (CI = 4.91-16) and 6.09 (CI = 3.42-10.85), respectively. CONCLUSION: SD BIOSENSOR is a useful assay, but some caveats must be considered before the general implementation.","Peña-Rodríguez, Marcela; Viera-Segura, Oliver; García-Chagollán, Mariel; Zepeda-Nuño, José Sergio; Muñoz-Valle, José Francisco; Mora-Mora, Jesús; Espinoza-De León, Gabriela; Bustillo-Armendáriz, Gustavo; García-Cedillo, Fernanda; Vega-Magaña, Natali",J Clin Lab Anal,207,1

Now, although a few drugs and vaccines have been proved for its treatment and prevention, little systematic comments are made to explain its susceptibility to humans. A few scattered studies used bioinformatics methods to explore the role of microRNA (miRNA) in COVID-19 infection. Combining these timely reports and previous studies about virus and miRNA, we comb through the available clues and seemingly make the perspective reasonable that the COVID-19 cleverly exploits the interplay between the small miRNA and other biomolecules to avoid being effectively recognized and attacked from host immune protection as well to deactivate functional genes that are crucial for immune system. In detail, SARS-CoV-2 can be regarded as a sponge to adsorb host immune-related miRNA, which forces host fall into dysfunction status of immune system. Besides, SARS-CoV-2 encodes its own miRNAs, which can enter host cell and are not perceived by the host's immune system, subsequently targeting host function genes to cause illnesses. Therefore, this article presents a reasonable viewpoint that the miRNA-based interplays between the host and SARS-CoV-2 may be the primary cause that SARS-CoV-2 accesses and attacks the host cells.","Zhang, Song; Amahong, Kuerbannisha; Sun, Xiuna; Lian, Xichen; Liu, Jin; Sun, Huaicheng; Lou, Yan; Zhu, Feng; Qiu, Yunqing",Brief Bioinform,207,21

We aimed to evaluate the effect of HSYF on the progression to severe disease in mild and moderate COVID-19 patients. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with mild and moderate COVID-19 in a quarantine station in Wuchang District, Wuhan. Using the real-time Internet information collection application and Centers for Disease Control for the Wuchang District, patient data were collected through patient self-reports and follow-ups. HSYF intervention was defined as the exposure. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who progressed to a severe disease status, and a stratification analysis was performed. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to identify influencing factors that may affect the outcome. Further, we used propensity score matching (PSM) to assess the effect of HSYF intervention on the conversion of mild and moderate to a severe disease status. Totally, 721 mild and moderate COVID-19 patients were enrolled, including 430 HSYF users (exposed group) and 291 non-users (control group). No cases in the exposed group and 19 (6.5 %, P < 0.001) cases in the control group progressed to severe disease, and the difference between the two groups (exposed group-control group) was -6.5 % [95 % confidence interval (CI): (-8.87 %, -4.13 %)]. Univariate regression analysis revealed sex (male), age, fever, cough, and fatigue as risk factors for progression to severe disease. After PSM, none of the HSYF users and 7 (4.7 %, P = 0.022) non-users transitioned to severe disease, and the difference between the two groups (exposed group-control group) was -4.7 % [95 % CI: (-8.2 %, -1.2 %)]. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that sex (male) [OR: 3.145; 95 % CI: 1.036-9.545; P = 0.043] and age (> 48 years) [odds ratio (OR): 1.044; 95 % CI: 1.001-1.088; P = 0.044] were independent risk factors for conversion to severe disease. Therefore, HSYF can significantly reduce the progression to severe disease in patients with mild and moderate COVID-19, which may effectively prevent and treat the disease. However, further larger clinical studies are required to verify our results.","Tian, Jiaxing; Yan, Shiyan; Wang, Han; Zhang, Ying; Zheng, Yujiao; Wu, Haoran; Li, Xiuyang; Gao, Zezheng; Ai, Yanke; Gou, Xiaowen; Zhang, Lei; He, Liyun; Lian, Fengmei; Liu, Baoyan; Tong, Xiaolin",Pharmacol Res,207,1

A rapid overview revealed that many countries have similar strategies for controlling COVID-19, including the suspension of air travel, the lockdown on the cities with the most cases detected, active case findings, monitoring of close contacts, and raising public awareness. Also, they used a gradual and phased plan to reopen activities. So, the difference between countries in the burden of COVID-19 can be attributable to the strict mode and nonstrict mode of implementation of strategies.

Strong illness expectations may place COVID-19 essential workers at risk. It is unclear, however, whether knowledge can moderate the negative effects of pessimistic illness expectations on protective behaviors. We test COVID-19 knowledge as a moderator of the effects of (1) pessimistic illness expectations and (2) essential worker status on adherence to protective behaviors. Methods: Participants (n = 350) completed measures of knowledge, illness expectations, and protective behaviors. We used chi-square tests to examine associations between variables and logistic regressions to test the moderation models predicting adherence (low, high) while controlling for demographics. Results: Knowledge, illness expectations, and adherence were significantly associated with each other (p < 0.05). Essential workers had stronger illness expectations and lower knowledge than did non-essential workers (p < 0.001). Logistic regressions showed a non-significant Worker Status × Knowledge interaction (p = 0.59) but a significant Knowledge × Illness Expectations interaction (p < 0.05) indicating that those with strong illness expectations and low knowledge were disproportionately at risk of failing to adhere to recommended behaviors. Conclusions: Knowledge promotes protective behaviors by buffering the negative effects of pessimistic illness expectations. Essential workers are more likely to have low levels of knowledge with strong illness expectations, suggesting that educational policies may be warranted.","Miller, Lisa M Soederberg; Gee, Perry M; Katz, Rachael A",Front Public Health,207,16

Vaccine hesitancy may be fueled by health information obtained from a variety of sources, including new media such as the Internet and social media platforms. As access to technology has improved, social media has attained global penetrance. In contrast to traditional media, social media allow individuals to rapidly create and share content globally without editorial oversight. Users may self-select content streams, contributing to ideological isolation. As such, there are considerable public health concerns raised by anti-vaccination messaging on such platforms and the consequent potential for downstream vaccine hesitancy, including the compromise of public confidence in future vaccine development for novel pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2 for the prevention of COVID-19. In this review, we discuss the current position of social media platforms in propagating vaccine hesitancy and explore next steps in how social media may be used to improve health literacy and foster public trust in vaccination.","Puri, Neha; Coomes, Eric A; Haghbayan, Hourmazd; Gunaratne, Keith",Hum Vaccin Immunother,207,16

An age-stratified agent-based model was developed to explore the impact of shutdowns to control SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Canada under the assumption that current efforts to control the epidemic remains insufficient and in the absence of a vaccine. Methods: We estimated the current levels of interventions in Canada to generate a baseline scenario from 7 February to 7 September 2020. Four aspects of shutdowns were explored in scenarios that ran from 8 September 2020 to 7 January 2022, these included the impact of how quickly shutdowns are implemented, the duration of shutdowns, the minimum break (delays) between shutdowns and the types of sectors to shutdown. Comparisons among scenarios were made using cases, hospitalizations, deaths and shutdown days during the 700-day model runs. Results: We found a negative relationship between reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and the number of shutdown days. However, we also found that for shutdowns to be optimally effective, they need to be implemented fast with minimal delay, initiated when community transmission is low, sustained for an adequate period and be stringent and target multiple sectors, particularly those driving transmission. By applying shutdowns in this manner, the total number of shutdown days could be reduced compared to delaying the shutdowns until further into the epidemic when transmission is higher and/or implementing short insufficient shutdowns that would require frequent re-implementation. This paper contrasts a range of shutdown strategies and trade-offs between health outcomes and economic metrics that need to be considered within the local context. Interpretation: Given the immense socioeconomic impact of shutdowns, they should be avoided where possible and used only when other public health measures are insufficient to control the epidemic. If used, the time it buys to delay the epidemic should be used to enhance other equally effective, but less disruptive, public health measures.","Ng, V.; Fazil, A.; Waddell, L.

Of particular concern, yet understated, is the potential to increase the double burden of malnutrition (DBM) epidemic. This coexistence of undernutrition together with overweight and obesity, or diet-related non-communicable disease (NCD), within low- to middle-income countries (LMICs) is increasing rapidly. Although multiple factors contribute to the DBM, food insecurity (FI) and gut microbiota dysbiosis play a crucial role. Both under- and overnutrition have been shown to be a consequence of food insecurity. The gut microbiota has also been recently implicated in playing a role in under- and overnutrition, with altered community structure and function common to both. The pandemic has already caused significant shifts in food availability which has immediate effects on the gut microbiome. In this opinion paper, we discuss how COVID-19 may indirectly exacerbate the DBM through food insecurity and the gut microbiome. MAIN TEXT: The World Food Programme (WFP) estimates that 265 million people in LMICs will experience acute hunger in 2020 due to the pandemic, nearly doubling the original projection of 135 million. Global border closures to food trade, loss of food production, and stark decline in household income will exacerbate starvation while simultaneously necessitating that families resort to calorie-dense, nutrient-poor foods, thereby increasing obesity. While food insecurity, which is the persistent lack of consistent access to adequate and nutrient-rich foods, will primarily drive nutrition behavior, the gut microbiome is perhaps a key biological mechanism. Numerous human and animal studies describe low diversity and an increase in inflammatory species as characteristic features of the undernourished and overnourished gut microbiota. Indeed, fecal transplant studies show that microbiota transfer from undernourished and overnourished humans to germ-free mice lacking a microbiome transfers the physical and metabolic phenotype, suggesting a causal role for the microbiota in under- and overnutrition. The observed microbiome dysbiosis within severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) coupled with the DBM presents a viscous cycle. CONCLUSION: Low- to mid-income countries will likely see an increase in the DBM epidemic. Providing access to nutritious foods and protecting individuals' gut microbiome to ""flatten the curve"" of the DBM trajectory should be prioritized.","Littlejohn, Paula; Finlay, B Brett",BMC Med,207,16

The mobility and agility of UAVs along with intelligent on-board sensors (cameras, acoustics, and radar) are more effective during the early stages of disaster response. The ability of radars to penetrate through objects and operate during low visibility conditions enables detection of occluded human subjects on and under debris when other sensing modalities fail. Recently, radars have been deployed on UAVs to measure minute human physiological parameters such as respiratory and heart rates while sensing through clothing and building materials. Aggregating radar measurements with the information from other sensors is broadening the applications of drones in life-critical situations. Signal processing techniques are critical in enabling UAV-borne radars for human vital sign detection (VSD) in multiple operation modes. Novel radar configurations such as in a UAV swarm and tethered UAVs are required to facilitate multi-tasking and high endurance, respectively.

We constructed a VH-phage library and targeted the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding interface of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor-binding domain (Spike-RBD). Using a masked selection approach, we identified VH binders to two non-overlapping epitopes and further assembled these into multivalent and bi-paratopic formats.

Clinical management is still being studied, however, it is well documented that pronated patients with non-COVID ARDS can improve oxygenation and V/Q mismatch, as well as increase lung volume and recruitment of collapsed alveoli. We hypothesized that proning patients with COVID-19 pneumonia will have similar pathophysiologic advantages and lead to less need for mechanical ventilation, lower mortality, and shorter hospitalization time. Methods: We conducted a large retrospective, single-institution cohort analysis of adult patients with diagnosed SARS-CoV-19 pneumonia who were admitted to our medical intensive care unit (ICU) between 3/11/2020 and 8/19/2020. We categorized patients into proning (at least 4 hours daily) versus non-proning cohorts. The primary outcome of our study was progression to mechanical ventilation while secondary outcomes compared in-hospital mortality rates, ICU and hospital length of stay (HLOS). We used the quick-COVID Severity Index (qCSI) to assign baseline severity scores to all patients. Results: A total of 270 patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia were admitted to the ICU. Nine patients were excluded due to unrelated illness confounders, leaving a total of 261 patients (including 9 patients who were intubated before their first proning session). Of the patients who proned for 4 or more hours daily, 38.99% (23/59) required mechanical ventilation after proning compared with 41.97% (81/193) who were not proned (pvalue = .68). Secondary outcomes for those proned vs not proned include;in-hospital mortality of 22.06% (15/68) vs 33.12% (62/193) a p-value of .12, median HLOS 14 days vs 13 days, ICU LOS 6 days vs 4 days. The qCSI score for the proned group was 6.77 vs 6.68 for those not proned. Conclusions: Based on our analysis, there was not a statistically significant reduction in the progression to MV in patients with severe SARS-CoV-19 pneumonia who proned compared to those who did not prone. However, there was a positive correlation associated with proning and reduction in the in-hospital mortality rate of these patients, a difference of 11%. Additionally, there was no significant difference in ICU LOS or HLOS.","Pajak, A.; Gandhi, P.; Thakur, S.; Berg, B.; Liou, J.; Slaby, I.; Arsenault, H.; Valentino, D.; Deitchman, A.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,207,11

Results revealed that virus-related worries decreased over time, whereas economic worries remained largely constant. Moreover, the acceptance of NPIs considerably decreased over time. Virus-related worries were positively associated with acceptance of NPIs, whereas this relationship was negative regarding economic worries (albeit smaller and less consistent). Unexpectedly, no interactions between virus-related worries and economic worries were found.

ALVC was not included in the 2010 International Task Force Criteria (ITFC) for arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy diagnosis and data regarding this phenotype are scarce. Methods - clinical characteristics were reported from all consecutive patients diagnosed with ALVC, defined as a LV isolated late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and fibro-fatty replacement (FFR) at cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) plus genetic variants associated with ARVC and/or of an endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) showing FFR complying with the 2010 ITFC in the LV. Results - twenty-five ALVC patients (53 [48-59] years, 60% male) were enrolled. T-wave inversion in infero-lateral and left precordial leads were the most common ECG abnormalities. Overall arrhythmic burden at study inclusion was 56%. CMR showed LV LGE in the LV lateral and/or posterior basal segments in all patients. In 72% of the patients an invasive evaluation was performed, in which electroanatomical voltage mapping (EVM) and EVM-guided EMB showed low endocardial voltages and FFR in areas of LGE presence. Genetic variants in desmosomal genes (desmoplakin and desmoglein-2) were identified in 12/25 of the cohort presenting pathogenic/likely-pathogenic variants. A definite/borderline 2010 ITFC ARVC diagnosis was reached only in 11/25 patients.

COPD impairs body functioning, reduces quality of life, and creates a great economic burden for society. Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) has become an important nonpharmacological treatment for COPD. This paper systematically reviews economic evaluations of PR in COPD patients in different settings. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to understand the cost-effectiveness of PR in different settings for COPD to provide economic evidence for decision-makers. METHODS: We searched eight databases from their inception to 23 November 2019. The results were presented in terms of an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), and the decision uncertainty was expressed by cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs). We used the Consensus on Health Economic Criteria to assess study quality. RESULTS: This review included ten studies that matched the selection criteria. Five studies compared PR with usual care in primary healthcare or outpatient departments. Two studies compared community-based PR with hospital PR or usual care. In the other studies, PR was mainly carried out at home. Compared with usual care, PR was cost-effective in primary healthcare institutions or outpatient departments. According to CEACs, community-based PR had a 50% probability of cost-effectiveness at £30,000/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) compared with hospital PR in the UK. Based on the ICER, community-based PR was ""moderately"" cost-effective, with a ratio of 32,425/QALY compared with usual care in the Netherlands. Home-based PR was dominant compared with usual care, and tele-rehabilitation was dominant compared with traditional home PR. CONCLUSIONS: PR conducted in different settings can potentially be cost-effective, as measured using QALY or the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ).","Liu, Shengnan; Zhao, Qiheng; Li, Wenshuo; Zhao, Xuetong; Li, Kun",Appl. health econ. health policy,207,22

Nurses play a key role in the public health response to such crises, delivering direct patient care and reducing the risk of exposure to the infectious disease. The experience of providing nursing care in this context has the potential to have significant short and long term consequences for individual nurses, society and the nursing profession. Objectives: To synthesize and present the best available evidence on the experiences of nurses working in acute hospital settings during a pandemic. Design: This review was conducted using the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for systematic reviews. Data sources: A structured search using CINAHL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, MedNar, ProQuest and Index to Theses was conducted. Review methods: All studies describing nurses' experiences were included regardless of methodology. Themes and narrative statements were extracted from included papers using the SUMARI data extraction tool from Joanna Briggs Institute. Results: Thirteen qualitative studies were included in the review. The experiences of 348 nurses generated a total of 116 findings, which formed seven categories based on similarity of meaning. Three synthesized findings were generated from the categories: (i) Supportive nursing teams providing quality care; (ii) Acknowledging the physical and emotional impact; and (iii) Responsiveness of systematised organizational reaction. Conclusions: Nurses are pivotal to the health care response to infectious disease pandemics and epidemics. This systematic review emphasises that nurses' require Governments, policy makers and nursing groups to actively engage in supporting nurses, both during and following a pandemic or epidemic. Without this, nurses are likely to experience substantial psychological issues that can lead to burnout and loss from the nursing workforce.","Fernandez, Ritin; Lord, Heidi; Halcomb, Elizabeth; Moxham, Lorna; Middleton, Rebekkah; Alananzeh, Ibrahim; Ellwood, Laura",Int J Nurs Stud,207,17

The COVID-19 pandemic has distorted many informal caregivers' roles, which require serious adjustment for reducing caregiving stress and burden. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has created challenging situations in caregiving spaces, which have the tendency to cause informal caregivers to abuse older adults. However, research on elder abuse and mistreatment, up to this point, remains underexplored in Africa. We, therefore, call for a deeper research and interrogation on the pathways and dynamics of violence and abuse against older adults in Africa. We also raise awareness of increased risks of domestic elder abuse and neglect during COVID-19 to stimulate the interest of social welfare institutions in understanding this phenomenon and its prevalence in Africa. We argue that the COVID-19 pandemic should serve as an avenue for governments, social welfare institutions, public health authorities, civil society and traditional leaders in African countries to develop a comprehensive programme and create public awareness to protect older adults against abuse, violence and neglect. The practical ways of minimising the effect of COVID-19 on domestic elder abuse in African settings are further discussed.","Arthur-Holmes, Francis; Gyasi, Razak M",Glob Public Health,207,26

The retrospective analysis of the large scale tests of SARS-CoV-2 RNA may indicate some important information of this pandemic. We selected 12400 SARS-CoV-2 tests detected in Wuhan in the first semester of 2020 and made a systematic analysis of them, in order to find some beneficial clue for the consistent prevention and control of COVID-19.SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in suspected COVID-19 patients with real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). The patients' features including gender, age, type of specimen, source of patients, and the dynamic changes of the clinical symptoms were recorded and statistically analyzed. Quantitative and qualitive statistical analysis were carried out after laboratory detection.The positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 was 33.02% in 12,400 suspected patients' specimens in Wuhan at the first months of COVID-19 epidemics. SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR test of nasopharyngeal swabs might produce 4.79% (594/12400) presumptive results. The positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was significantly different between gender, age, type of specimen, source of patients, respectively (P < .05). The median window period from the occurrence of clinical symptom or close contact with COVID-19 patient to the first detection of positive PCR was 2 days (interquartile range, 1-4âdays). The median interval time from the first SARS-CoV-2 positive to the turning negative was 14âdays (interquartile range, 8-19.25âdays).This study reveals the comprehensive characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection from multiple perspectives, and it provides important clues and may also supply useful suggestions for future work of the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.","Wang, Jingwei; Bao, Anyu; Gu, Jian; He, Xiaoyun; Wu, Zegang; Qiao, Bin; Chen, Zhen; Xiong, Liang; Zhang, Yan; Zheng, Hongyun; Li, Feng; Zhao, Zhijun; Mei, Siqing; Tong, Yongqing",Medicine (Baltimore),207,16

Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a membrane-bound carboxypeptidase that forms a dimer and serves as the cellular receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). ACE2 is also a key negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system that modulates vascular functions. We report here the properties of a trimeric ACE2 ectodomain variant, engineered using a structure-based approach. The trimeric ACE2 variant has a binding affinity of ~60 pM for the spike protein of SARS­CoV­2 (compared with 77 nM for monomeric ACE2 and 12-22 nM for dimeric ACE2 constructs), and its peptidase activity and the ability to block activation of angiotensin II receptor type 1 in the renin-angiotensin system are preserved. Moreover, the engineered ACE2 potently inhibits SARS­CoV­2 infection in cell culture. These results suggest that engineered, trimeric ACE2 may be a promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent for treating COVID-19.","Xiao, Tianshu; Lu, Jianming; Zhang, Jun; Johnson, Rebecca I; McKay, Lindsay G A; Storm, Nadia; Lavine, Christy L; Peng, Hanqin; Cai, Yongfei; Rits-Volloch, Sophia; Lu, Shen; Quinlan, Brian D; Farzan, Michael; Seaman, Michael S; Griffiths, Anthony; Chen, Bing",Nat. struct. mol. biol,207,20

The spreading of a virus (such as SARS-CoV-2) in a community, spreading computer viruses in communication networks, or spreading gossip on a social network is the subject of epidemic modeling. The Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) is one of the most popular epidemic models. One crucial issue in epidemic modeling is the determination of the spreading ability of the nodes. Thus, for example, super spreaders can be detected in the early stages. However, the SIR is a stochastic model, and it needs heavy Monte-Carlo simulations. Hence, the researchers focused on combining several centrality measures to distinguish the spreading capabilities of nodes. In this study, we proposed a new method called Lexical Sorting Centrality (LSC), which combines multiple centrality measures. The LSC uses a sorting mechanism similar to lexical sorting to combine various centrality measures for ranking nodes. We conducted experiments on six datasets using SIR to evaluate the performance of LSC and compared LSC with degree centrality (DC), eigenvector centrality (EC), closeness centrality (CC), betweenness centrality (BC), and Gravitational Centrality (GC). Experimental results show that LSC distinguishes the spreading ability of nodes more accurately, more decisively, and faster.","Şimşek, Aybike",Journal of King Saud University - Computer and Information Sciences,207,9

Under non-intervention, peak caseload is maximised, but no differences are observed in infection rates across poor and non-poor. When we introduce different forms of social distancing interventions, peak caseloads are reduced, but infection rates of the poor are systematically higher than for non-poor across all scenarios. Larger populations, higher fractions of poor, and greater intensity of interventions are found to progressively worsen outcomes for the poor, vis-a-vis the non-poor. Increasing population leads to higher infection rates among the poor, supporting concerns that households in large high-density settlements like slums amongst the most at-risk population groups during an outbreak. Related to this, increasing population of the urban poor is found to worsen infection outcomes of the poor, and given the expansion of developing cities into large metropolises, this is an issue of significant concern for public health and economic wellbeing. The poor are also found disproportionately affected by increasing length and intensity of social distancing measures, pointing to the immediate need for countries to have clear guidelines on how social distancing can be practiced in high density slum settlements, given local contexts. Sustainable solutions for the long-term will require concerted investment in environmental and physical infrastructure to improve living conditions. Finally, addressing these iniquitous outcomes for the poor creates better outcomes for the whole population, including the non-poor.","Sahasranaman, Anand; Jensen, Henrik Jeldtoft",,207,16

At the forefront of the ICU are highly trained nurses with a professional obligation to care for patients with COVID-19 despite the potential to become infected. The aim of this study was to explore ICU nurses' willingness to care during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A prospective cross-sectional study to explore ICU nurses' willingness to provide care during the COVID-19 pandemic was undertaken between 25 March and 3 April 2020 at a large principal and referral teaching hospital in Sydney, NSW Australia. RESULTS: A total of 83 ICU nurses completed the survey. Approximately 60% reported receiving sufficient information from managers regarding COVID-19 and about caring for a patient with COVID-19. Ninety percent of nurses were concerned about spreading COVID-19 to their family. Sixty one percent of the nurses indicated that they were willing to care for patients with COVID-19. Receiving timely communication from managers was the only predictor of willingness to care among ICU nurses.

Performing surgical tracheostomy and tracheostomy care requires a strategy that mitigates these risks and maintains the quality of patient care. METHODS: This study is a multidisciplinary review of institutional tracheostomy guidelines and clinical pathways. Modifications to support clinical decision making in the context of COVID-19 were derived by consensus and available evidence. RESULTS: Modified guidelines for all phases of tracheostomy care at an academic tertiary care center in the setting of COVID-19 are presented. DISCUSSION: During the various phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, clinicians must carefully consider the indications, procedural precautions, and postoperative care for tracheostomies.

Primary outcomes included inpatient mortality, required ventilatory support, and duration of inpatient treatment. Pulmonary embolism sequala was the only secondary outcome. After balancing data, key variables were feature selected for each outcome using random forests. Predictive models were then learned and constructed using Bayesian networks. RESULTS: The proposed probabilistic models were able to predict, using feature selected risk factors, the probability of the mentioned outcomes. Overall, our findings demonstrate reliable, multivariable, quantitative predictive models for four outcomes, which utilise readily available clinical information for COVID-19 adult inpatients.

Fibrinogen and D-dimer levels are typically increased. The risk for venous thromboembolism is markedly increased, especially in patients in the intensive care unit despite prophylactic dose anticoagulation. Pulmonary microvascular thrombosis has also been described and the risk for arterial thrombotic diseases also appears to be increased while bleeding is less common than thrombosis, but it can occur. Evaluation for venous thromboembolism may be challenging because symptoms of pulmonary embolism overlap with COVID-19, and imaging studies may not be feasible in all cases. The threshold for evaluation or diagnosis of thromboembolism should be low given the high frequency of these events. Management and treatment are new challenges due to the paucity of high-quality evidence regarding efficacy and safety of different approaches to prevent or treat thromboembolic complications of the disease. All inpatients should receive thromboprophylaxis unless contraindicated.

The complement system is an important component of innate immunity and can stimulate inflammation, but its role in COVID-19 is unknown. METHODS: A prospective, longitudinal, single center study was performed in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Plasma concentrations of complement factors C3a, C3c, and terminal complement complex (TCC) were assessed at baseline and during hospital admission. In parallel, routine laboratory and clinical parameters were collected from medical files and analyzed. RESULTS: Complement factors C3a, C3c and TCC were significantly increased in plasma of COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls (p<0.05). These complement factors were especially elevated in ICU patients during the entire disease course (p<0.005 for C3a and TCC). More intense complement activation was observed in patients that deceased and in patients with thromboembolic events. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients demonstrate activation of the complement system, which is related to disease severity. This pathway may be involved in the dysregulated pro-inflammatory response associated with increased mortality and thromboembolic complications.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of indicators related to access to healthcare services, in COVID-19 surveillance. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A time series analysis was performed using the weekly incidence rate of COVID-19 in Mainland Portugal, between weeks 14/2020 (March 30 to April 5) and 25/2020 (June 15 to 21), and six indicators: 1) COVID-19 consultations in primary healthcare; 2) number of COVID-19 emergency department visits; 3) number of emergency department visits due to viral pneumonia; 4) number of hospitalizations due to viral pneumonia; 5) proportion of emergency department visits due to viral pneumonia; and 6) proportion of hospitalizations for viral pneumonia. Pearson correlation and cross-correlations were computed. RESULTS: A strong correlation was found between the weekly incidence rate of COVID-19 and all indicators. [(1) 0.76; (2) 0.82; (3) 0.77; (4) 0.84; (5) 0.86; e (6) 0.90]. Emergency department visits and hospitalizations for viral pneumonia detect variations in the frequency of the disease with a one week lag compared to the incidence rate of COVID-19, in one week. COVID-19 consultations in primary healthcare and emergency department visits trail behind the incidence rate of COVID-19, in one week. The proportion of viral pneumonias in emergency department visits, or hospitalizations, is temporally aligned with the weekly incidence rate of COVID-19. DISCUSSION: The delay found in the COVID-19 primary healthcare consultations and emergency department visits, may be related to changes in access to healthcare services and clinical coding. Emergency department visits and hospitalizations for viral pneumonia may be useful in the early detection of COVID-19. Viral pneumonia may have been coded as being of unknown origin. Future monitoring of these indicators is necessary to ascertain whether the incidence of COVID-19 is significantly influenced by changes in testing strategies. The indicators described in this study will be an asset for the optimization of testing strategies, allocation of healthcare resources to the communities that are most vulnerable to severe morbidity and assessing vaccination impact. As such, surveillance systems based on clinical data will be a valuable complementary tool to SINAVE. CONCLUSION: The indicators under analysis could be used regularly, with special attention to viral pneumonias, to detect outbreaks of COVID-19. Information on pneumonia of unknown etiology may be considered in the surveillance of COVID-19.","Torres, Ana Rita; Silva, Susana; Kislaya, Irina; Martins, João Pedro; Matias Dias, Carlos; Rodrigues, Ana Paula",Acta Med Port,207,16

While many surveys have been conducted, most are focused on drinking changes in the general population and validation with biological markers is lacking. METHOD: We performed a retrospective cohort study among patients with AUD attending a urine drug screening program. With mixed-effects logistic regression models, we assessed the probability of screening positive for ethyl glucuronide according to patients' main clinical characteristics and time of analysis (either prior to or after a lockdown was implemented in Spain). RESULTS: A total of 362 patients provided 2,040 urine samples (1,295 prior to lockdown, 745 during lockdown). The mean age of participants was 52.0 years (SD 12.6), and 69.2% were men. Of the 43% of patients tested for other drugs 22% screened positive. After adjusting for all covariates, the odds of screening positive for ethyl glucuronide during lockdown almost doubled (OR = 1.99, 95% CI 1.20 to 3.33, p = 0.008). Other significant covariates included testing positive for other drugs (OR = 10.79, 95% CI 4.60 to 26.97) and length of treatment (OR = 0.59, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.74). CONCLUSIONS: Our data support an association between the lockdown due to COVID-19 and increased alcohol use in patients with AUD. Thus, addiction healthcare systems could face significant challenges ahead. In light of these findings, it is essential to evaluate prospectively how patients with AUD are affected by the pandemic and how health systems respond to their needs.","Barrio, Pablo; Baldaquí, Nuria; Andreu, Magalí; Kilian, Carolin; Rehm, Jürgen; Gual, Antoni; Manthey, Jakob",Alcohol Clin Exp Res,207,33

We begin by observing that the principles of risk communication are regarded as basic best practices rather than as moral rules. We argue firstly, that they nonetheless encapsulate value commitments, and secondly, that these values should more explicitly underpin communication practices in a pandemic. Our focus is to explore the values associated with the principle of communicating early and often and how use of this principle can signal respect for people's self-determination whilst also conveying other values relevant to the circumstances. We suggest that doing this requires communication that explicitly acknowledges and addresses with empathy those who will be most directly impacted by any disease-control measures. We suggest further that communication in a pandemic should be more explicit about how values are expressed in response strategies and that doing so may improve the appraisal of new information as it becomes available.","Hooker, Claire; Leask, Julie",J Bioeth Inq,207,16

Although states play a major role in health care funding and administration, public and scholarly debates over these proposals have generally not addressed the potential disruption that reform proposals might create for the current state role in health care. We examine how potential reforms influence state-federal relations, and how outside factors like partisanship and exogenous shocks like the COVID-19 pandemic interact with underlying preferences of each level of government. All else equal, reforms that expand the ACA within its current framework would provide the least disruption for current arrangements and allow for smoother transitions for providers and patients, rather than the more radical restructuring proposed by Medicare for All or the cuts embodied in Republican plans.","O039,; Mahen, Patrick N; Petersen, Laura A",J. gen. intern. med,207,29

Lymph node metastasis is extremely rare in true gastrointestinal leiomyosarcoma, and there are no reports of malignant transformation from leiomyoma. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient was an old woman who had undergone endoscopic mucosal resection for an Is polyp on the left side of the transverse colon at the age of 73. She was diagnosed with leiomyoma with positive surgical margins. Subsequently, she presented to our institution with a sensation of pressure in the upper abdominal region as a chief complaint at the age of 76 years. Abdominal computed tomography and colorectal endoscopy showed a tumor lesion with invagination of the intestines in the transverse colon, the same site as that of the previously resected leiomyoma. A biopsy suggested a smooth muscle tumor, and we performed partial left transverse colectomy and lymph node dissection under a diagnosis of recurrence and enlargement of the previously incompletely resected leiomyoma. Histopathological examination revealed spindle-shaped tumor cells, and the mitotic activity was 30-40/10 high-power field. Tumor cells were immunohistologically positive for &#945;-smooth muscle actin and h-caldesmon; partially positive for desmin; negative for c-kit, CD34, DOG-1, and the S-100 protein; and showed a Ki-67 labeling index of 70-80%. She was diagnosed with leiomyosarcoma malignantly transformed from leiomyoma. Metastasis was found in 1 of the 14 resected lymph nodes. The patient did not undergo adjuvant chemotherapy, but has survived with no recurrence at 2 years after the surgery. CONCLUSIONS: We have reported a case of leiomyosarcoma of the transverse colon with lymph node metastasis that was malignantly transformed from a leiomyoma.","Tago, Tomoya; Suzuki, Shuji; Kuroda, Jun; Udou, Ryutaro; Nishida, Kiyotaka; Oshiro, Yukio; Shimazaki, Jirou; Kou, Keni; Morishita, Yukio; Shimoda, Mitsugi",Surg Case Rep,207,15

To reach this goal, the manufacturing and logistic processes should be affordable to all countries, irrespectively of economical and climatic conditions. Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are bacterial-derived vesicles that can be engineered to incorporate heterologous antigens. Given the inherent adjuvanticity, such modified OMVs can be used as vaccine to induce potent immune responses against the associated protein. Here we show that OMVs engineered to incorporate peptides derived from the receptor binding motif (RBM) of the spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 elicit an effective immune response in immunized mice, resulting in the production of neutralizing antibodies. The immunity induced by the vaccine is sufficient to protect K18-hACE2 transgenic mice from intranasal challenge with SARS-CoV-2, preventing both virus replication in the lungs and the pathology associated with virus infection. Furthermore, we show that OMVs can be effectively decorated with RBM peptides derived from a different genetic variant of SARS-CoV-2, inducing a similarly potent neutralization activity in vaccinated mice. Altogether, given the convenience associated with ease of engineering, production and distribution, our results demonstrate that OMV-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines can be a crucial addition to the vaccines currently available.","Grandi, Alberto; Tomasi, Michele; Accordini, Silvia; Bertelli, Cinzia; Vanzo, Teresa; Gagliardi, Assunta; Caproni, Elena; Tamburini, Silvia; Fantappie, Laura; Lascio, Gabriele Di; Bisoffi, Zeno; Piubelli, Chiara; Valenti, Maria Teresa; Carbonare, Luca Dalle; Zipeto, Donato; Rava, Micol; Fumagalli, Valeria; Lucia, Pietro Di; Marotta, Davide; Sala, Eleonora; Iannacone, Matteo; Cherepanov, Peter; Bolognesi, Martino; Pizzato, Massimo; Grandi, Guido",,207,9

This study was conducted to clarify the patient's characteristics whose disease progressed to severe status. METHODS: The medical records of all consecutive 300 Japanese patients hospitalized at our institution between February and November 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. The clinical characteristics were evaluated to compare between mild (no oxygen needed), moderate (oxygen needs of 1-4 L/min), and severe diseases (oxygen needs of 5 L/min or more). RESULTS: The median age was 68 years old, with 123 (41.0%) males and 177 (59.0%) females. Of these, 199 patients (66.3%), 55 patients (18.3%), 46 patients (15.3%) patients were in the mild disease, moderate disease, severe disease groups, respectively. Patients with severe disease were more likely to be older, have more comorbidities, and tended to have higher body mass index. In laboratory data, lymphocyte count, levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), LDH, and AST on admission were significantly associated with the severity. In multivariate analysis, age and CRP were the independent risk factors for severe disease (OR = 1.050, 1.130, respectively). The optimal cut-off value for age was 74 years old and that for CRP was 3.15 mg/dL. CONCLUSIONS: Age and CRP were independently associated with disease severity of COVID-19 in multivariate analysis. Additionally, the numbers of underlying disease, lymphocyte count, and inflammatory markers such as LDH and D-dimer may also be related to disease severity.","Otoshi, Ryota; Hagiwara, Eri; Kitayama, Takaaki; Yamaya, Takafumi; Higa, Katsuyuki; Murohashi, Kota; Sato, Yozo; Tabata, Erina; Shintani, Ryota; Okabayashi, Hiroko; Ikeda, Satoshi; Niwa, Takashi; Nakazawa, Atsuhito; Oda, Tsuneyuki; Okuda, Ryo; Sekine, Akiamasa; Kitamura, Hideya; Baba, Tomohisa; Komatsu, Shigeru; Ogura, Takashi",J Infect Chemother,207,24

To address this problem, integrated child health interventions that include support for the well-being of mothers must be adapted and assessed in humanitarian settings. Baby Friendly Spaces (BFS) is a holistic program that aims to improve the health and wellbeing of pregnant and lactating women and their children under two years of age by providing psychosocial support and enhancing positive infant and young child-care practices. Using a mixed-methods, pre-post design, this study explored ways to strengthen the implementation and acceptability of the BFS program, and assess outcomes associated with participation among South Sudanese mothers and their children living in the Nguenyyiel refugee camp in Gambella, Ethiopia. Discussion: A stronger evidence-base for integrated maternal and child health interventions, like BFS, in humanitarian emergencies is needed, but effectively conducting this type of research in unstable settings means encountering and working through myriad challenges. In this paper we discuss lessons learned while implementing this study, including, challenges related to ongoing local political and tribal conflicts and extreme conditions; implementation of a new digital data monitoring system; staff capacity building and turnover; and measurement were encountered. Strategies to mitigate such challenges included hiring and training new staff members. Regular weekly skype calls were held between Action Against Hunger Paris headquarters, the Action Against Hunger team in Gambella and Johns Hopkins' academic partners to follow study implementation progress and troubleshoot any emerging issues. Staff capacity building strategies included holding brief and focused trainings continuously throughout the study for both new and current staff members. Lastly, we engaged local Nuer staff members to help ensure study measures and interview questions were understandable among study participants. Conclusions: Research focused on strengthening program implementation is critically important for improving maternal and child health in humanitarian emergencies. Research in such settings demands critical problem-solving skills, strong supervision systems, flexibility in timeline and logistics, and tailor-made training for program and research staff members and context- adapted strategies for retaining existing staff.","Lasater, M E; Woldeyes, G M; Le Roch, K; Phan, X; Solomon-Osborne, A; Murray, S M",Confl Health,207,1

Data were extracted from the World Health Organization's (WHO) Global Health Observatory data repository regarding the polio immunization coverage estimates and correlated to the overall morbidity and mortality for COVID-19 among different countries. Data were analyzed using R software version 4.0.2. Mean and standard deviation were used to represent continuous variables while we used frequencies and percentages to represent categorical variables. The Kruskal-Wallis H test was used for continuous variables since they were not normally distributed. Moreover, the Spearman rank correlation coefficient (rho) was used to determine the relationship between different variables. There was a significantly positive correlation between the vaccine coverage (%) and both of total cases per one million populations (rho = 0.37; p-value < 0.001) and deaths per one million populations (rho = 0.30; p-value < 0.001).

A leading suspected risk factor is their role in the essential workforce. We aimed to describe COVID-19-related risk factors among Bhutanese and Burmese refugees in the United States. METHODS: We administered an anonymous online survey in May 2020 among community leaders of Bhutanese and Burmese refugees. Using a snowball sampling strategy, we invited community leaders to complete the survey and share the link with others who met inclusion criteria (English proficient, aged &#8805;18, currently living in the United States). We compared respondents with and without recent COVID-19 and identified risk factors for infection. RESULTS: Of 218 refugees in 23 states who completed the survey from May 15 through June 1, 2020, fifteen (6.9%) reported infection with COVID-19. Being an essential worker during the pandemic (odds ratio [OR] = 5.25; 95% CI, 1.21-22.78), having an infected family member (OR = 26.92; 95% CI, 5.19-139.75), and being female (OR = 5.63; 95% CI, 1.14-27.82) were risk factors for infection. Among 33 infected family members, 23 (69.7%) were essential workers. CONCLUSION: Although we had a small snowball sample, we found that working in essential industries was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 infection among Bhutanese and Burmese refugees.

SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious through saliva droplets. The structural analysis suggests that the virus enters human cells through the ligation of the spike protein to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The progression of Covid-19 has been divided into three main stages: stage I-viral response, stage II-pulmonary phase, and stage III-hyperinflammation phase. Once the patients enter stage III, it will likely need ventilation and it becomes difficult to manage. Thus, it will be of paramount importance to find therapies to prevent or slow down the progression of the disease toward stage III. The key event leading to hyperinflammation seems to be the activation of Th-17 immunity response and Cytokine storm. B2-adrenergic receptors (B2ARs) are expressed on airways and on all the immune cells such as macrophages, dendritic cells, B and T lymphocytes. Blocking (B2AR) has been proven, also in clinical settings, to reduce Th-17 response and negatively modulate inflammatory cytokines including IL-6 while increasing IFNÎ³. Non-selective beta-blockers are currently used to treat several diseases and have been proven to reduce stress-induced inflammation and reduce anxiety. For these reasons, we speculate that targeting B2AR in the early phase of Covid-19 might be beneficial to prevent hyperinflammation.","Barbieri, Antonio; Robinson, Nirmal; Palma, Giuseppe; Maurea, Nicola; Desiderio, Vincenzo; Botti, Gerardo",Front Immunol,207,24

The current gold standard for etiologic diagnosis is reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis of respiratory-tract specimens, but the test has a high false-negative rate owing to both nasopharyngeal swab sampling error and viral burden. Hence diagnostic imaging has emerged as a fundamental component of current management of COVID-19. Currently, high-resolution computed tomography is the main imaging tool for primary diagnosis and evaluation of disease severity in patients. Lung ultrasound (LUS) imaging has become a safe bedside imaging alternative that does not expose the patient to radiation and minimizes the risk of contamination. Although the number of studies to date is limited, LUS findings have demonstrated high diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy, comparable with those of chest computed tomography scans. In this note we review the current state of the art of LUS in evaluating pulmonary changes induced by COVID-19.

To properly understand and control this new epidemic, mathematical modelling is presented as a very effective tool that can illustrate the mechanisms of its propagation. In this regard, the use of compartmental models is the most prominent approach adopted in the literature to describe the dynamics of COVID-19. Along the same line, we aim during this study to generalize and ameliorate many existing works that consecrated to analyse the behaviour of this epidemic. Precisely, we propose an SQEAIHR epidemic system for Coronavirus. Our constructed model is enriched by taking into account the media intervention and vital dynamics. By the use of the next-generation matrix method, the theoretical basic reproductive number $R_0$ is obtained for COVID-19. Based on some nonstandard and generalized analytical techniques, the local and global stability of the disease-free equilibrium are proven when $R_0<1$. Moreover, in the case of $R_0>1$, the uniform persistence of COVID-19 model is also shown. In order to better adapt our epidemic model to reality, the randomness factor is taken into account by considering a proportional white noises, which leads to a well-posed stochastic model. Under appropriate conditions, interesting asymptotic properties are proved, namely: extinction and persistence in the mean. The theoretical results show that the dynamics of the perturbed COVID-19 model are determined by parameters that are closely related to the magnitude of the stochastic noise. Finally, we present some numerical illustrations to confirm our theoretical results and to show the impact of media intervention and quarantine strategies.","Kiouach, Driss; El-idrissi, Salim El Azami; Sabbar, Yassine",,207,26

Thus, viral cell entry in the sensitized mice seems to depend on viral RBD binding, albeit by a mechanism other than the canonical ACE2-mediated uptake route. This unique mode of viral entry, observed over a mildly injured tissue background, may contribute to the exacerbation of COVID-19 pathologies in patients with preexisting morbidities.","Falach, Reut; Bar-On, Liat; Lazar, Shlomi; Kadar, Tamar; Mazor, Ohad; Aftalion, Moshe; Gur, David; Evgy, Yentl; Shifman, Ohad; Aminov, Tamar; Israeli, Ofir; Cohen-Gihon, Inbar; Zaide, Galia; Gutman, Hila; Vagima, Yaron; Makdasi, Efi; Stein, Dana; Rosenfeld, Ronit; Alcalay, Ron; Zahavy, Eran; Levy, Haim; Glinert, Itai; Ben-Shmuel, Amir; Israely, Tomer; Melamed, Sharon; Politi, Boaz; Achdout, Hagit; Yitzhaki, Shmuel; Kronman, Chanoch; Sabo, Tamar",JCI insight,207,1

Limited data exist to guide the intensity of antithrombotic prophylaxis. Objective: To evaluate the effects of intermediate-dose vs standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation among patients with COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Design, Setting, and Participants: Multicenter randomized trial with a 2 × 2 factorial design performed in 10 academic centers in Iran comparing intermediate-dose vs standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation (first hypothesis) and statin therapy vs matching placebo (second hypothesis; not reported in this article) among adult patients admitted to the ICU with COVID-19. Patients were recruited between July 29, 2020, and November 19, 2020. The final follow-up date for the 30-day primary outcome was December 19, 2020. Interventions: Intermediate-dose (enoxaparin, 1 mg/kg daily) (n = 276) vs standard prophylactic anticoagulation (enoxaparin, 40 mg daily) (n = 286), with modification according to body weight and creatinine clearance. The assigned treatments were planned to be continued until completion of 30-day follow-up. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary efficacy outcome was a composite of venous or arterial thrombosis, treatment with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or mortality within 30 days, assessed in randomized patients who met the eligibility criteria and received at least 1 dose of the assigned treatment. Prespecified safety outcomes included major bleeding according to the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (type 3 or 5 definition), powered for noninferiority (a noninferiority margin of 1.8 based on odds ratio), and severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count <20 ×103/µL). All outcomes were blindly adjudicated. Results: Among 600 randomized patients, 562 (93.7%) were included in the primary analysis (median [interquartile range] age, 62 [50-71] years; 237 [42.2%] women). The primary efficacy outcome occurred in 126 patients (45.7%) in the intermediate-dose group and 126 patients (44.1%) in the standard-dose prophylaxis group (absolute risk difference, 1.5% [95% CI, -6.6% to 9.8%]; odds ratio, 1.06 [95% CI, 0.76-1.48]; P = .70). Major bleeding occurred in 7 patients (2.5%) in the intermediate-dose group and 4 patients (1.4%) in the standard-dose prophylaxis group (risk difference, 1.1% [1-sided 97.5% CI, -&#8734; to 3.4%]; odds ratio, 1.83 [1-sided 97.5% CI, 0.00-5.93]), not meeting the noninferiority criteria (P for noninferiority >.99). Severe thrombocytopenia occurred only in patients assigned to the intermediate-dose group (6 vs 0 patients; risk difference, 2.2% [95% CI, 0.4%-3.8%]; P = .01). Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients admitted to the ICU with COVID-19, intermediate-dose prophylactic anticoagulation, compared with standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation, did not result in a significant difference in the primary outcome of a composite of adjudicated venous or arterial thrombosis, treatment with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or mortality within 30 days. These results do not support the routine empirical use of intermediate-dose prophylactic anticoagulation in unselected patients admitted to the ICU with COVID-19.

We studied various statistical properties of the -PRRA- insertion at the RNA level (CCUCGGCGGGCA). The nucleotide composition and codon usage of this sequence are different from the rest of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. One of such features is two tandem CGG codons, although the CGG codon is the rarest codon in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. This suggests that the insertion sequence could cause ribosome pausing as the result of these rare codons. Due to population variants, the Nextstrain divergence measure of the CCU codon is extremely large. We cannot exclude that this divergence might affect host immune responses/effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, possibilities awaiting further investigation. Our experimental studies show that the expression level of original RNA sequence ""wildtype"" spike protein is much lower than for codon-optimized spike protein in all studied cell lines. Interestingly, the original spike sequence produces a higher titer of pseudoviral particles and a higher level of infection. Further mutagenesis experiments suggest that this dual-effect insert, comprised of a combination of overlapping translation pausing and furin sites, has allowed SARS-CoV-2 to infect its new host (human) more readily. This underlines the importance of ribosome pausing to allow efficient regulation of protein expression and also of cotranslational subdomain folding.","Postnikova, Olga A; Uppal, Sheetal; Huang, Weiliang; Kane, Maureen A; Villasmil, Rafael; Rogozin, Igor B; Poliakov, Eugenia; Redmond, T Michael",Int. j. mol. sci.

Pharmacists have the ability to perform certain point-of-care tests under federal regulations. On April 8, 2020, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health issued new guidance authorizing licensed pharmacists to order and administer COVID-19 tests. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study was to investigate the views of pharmacists about pharmacist-ordered and -administered COVID-19 testing. METHODS: A 13-item questionnaire was developed to survey pharmacists who currently hold an active license in Rhode Island. RESULTS: A total of 122 (13.8%) pharmacists consented and responded to at least 1 question of the survey. The results indicated that the primary concern of the pharmacists in regard to performing COVID-19 testing was spreading the infection to family members (71.3%). Becoming personally infected (59.8%) and not having access to appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) (62.3%) were the second and third most common concerns of the pharmacists. Almost all of the pharmacists (99.9%) responded that they would be willing to take part in the testing process if they had appropriate PPE. A total of 46% of the pharmacists expressed concern regarding reimbursement for their company, whereas 56% of the pharmacists requested personal compensation for this service. CONCLUSION: Expanding the pool of health care providers who can perform testing is critical to achieving and sustaining proposed testing thresholds. Rhode Island pharmacists are willing to take part in performing COVID-19 testing provided appropriate PPE is available and services are reimbursed. Pharmacists are the most accessible and essential health care providers willing to take on critically important roles during the COVID-19 pandemic provided appropriate safety measures can be met.","Uebbing, Emily; Lacroix, Matthew; Bratberg, Jeffrey; Federico, Christopher",,207,16

However, the function and potential regulatory mechanisms of SKA3 in breast cancer remain poorly understood. The present study was designed to gain a detailed relevance of SKA3 in breast cancer. METHODS: Expression of SKA3 in breast cancer was examined via real-time quantitative PCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry analysis. Malignant behaviors of breast cancer cells were investigated via cell counting kit-8, cell apoptosis, and transwell invasion assays. The activity of Wnt/ß-catenin signaling was monitored via luciferase reporter assay. The tumorigenicity of breast cancer cells in vivo was assessed via xenograft tumor assay. RESULTS: SKA3 expression was elevated in breast cancer tissue and was correlated with shorter survival rates in breast cancer patients. Knockdown of SKA3 caused marked reductions in cellular proliferation and invasion in breast cancer cells, whereas SKA3 overexpression accelerated proliferation and invasion. Knockdown of SKA3 resulted in decreased Akt and glycogen synthase kinase-3ß phosphorylation, and decreased expression of active ß-catenin, which lead to the inactivation of Wnt/ß-catenin signaling. Inhibition of Akt significantly reversed the SKA3 overexpression-induced activation of Wnt/ß-catenin signaling. Inhibition of Wnt/ß-catenin signaling markedly abrogated SKA3 overexpression-induced tumor-promotion effects, while re-activation of Wnt/ß-catenin signaling significantly reversed SKA3 knockdown-mediated tumor-inhibition effects. Knockdown of SKA3 resulted in a significant decrease in breast cancer tumor formation in vivo.

Specifically, the research examined how disparities in wealth might be associated with differences in emotional well-being before, during, versus after the nationwide COVID-19 outbreak in China. SETTING, PARTICIPANTS AND OUTCOME MEASURES: In this large-scale cross-sectional study, three rounds of nationally representative data collection (N=27 760) were conducted immediately before (December 2019), in the midst of (February 2020), versus immediately after (April 2020) the countrywide COVID-19 outbreak in China. Participants' emotional well-being, wealth (income, property ownership) and demographic information were measured using established instruments. Statistical analyses examined relationships between disparities in different types of wealth and emotional well-being across the pandemic phases. RESULTS: Although the onset of the coronavirus outbreak substantially degraded emotional well-being, having a higher income was associated with better emotional well-being during the outbreak. Property owners experienced a larger drop in emotional well-being during the outbreak than non-owners; however, the former was not emotionally worse off than the latter during the outbreak. After the nationwide COVID-19 outbreak had been contained and the economy reopened, those with more wealth of either type again became better off in emotional well-being than those with less. The highest income segment even experienced better emotional well-being after the end of the nationwide outbreak than prior to the outbreak. In contrast, the lowest income segment became worse off in emotional well-being after the nationwide outbreak ended than before the outbreak began. CONCLUSION: People with less wealth tend to be emotionally worse off throughout the different phases of a disease outbreak. In particular, even after an outbreak has been contained, the poor are less able to restore their psychological well-being.

The study here confronts this problem by developing a global analysis based on more than 160 countries. This paper proposes that Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, healthcare spending and air pollution of nations are critical factors associated with fatality rate of COVID-19. The statistical evidence seems in general to support that countries with a low average COVID-19 fatality rate have high expenditures in health sector >7.5% of GDP, high health expenditures per capita >$2,300 and a lower exposure of population to days exceeding safe levels of particulate matter (PM2.5). Another relevant finding here is that these countries have lower case fatality rates (CFRs) of COVID-19, regardless a higher percentage of population aged more than 65 years. Overall, then, this study finds that an effective and proactive strategy to reduce the negative impact of future pandemics, driven by novel viral agents, has to be based on a planning of enhancement of healthcare sector and of environmental sustainability that can reduce fatality rate of infectious diseases in society.","Coccia, Mario",Environ Res,207,5

In three psychiatry case-control cohorts, we compared the perceived mental health impact and coping and changes in depressive symptoms, anxiety, worry, and loneliness before and during the COVID-19 pandemic between people with and without lifetime depressive, anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive disorders. METHODS: Between April 1 and May 13, 2020, online questionnaires were distributed among the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety, Netherlands Study of Depression in Older Persons, and Netherlands Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Association cohorts, including people with (n=1181) and without (n=336) depressive, anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive disorders. The questionnaire contained questions on perceived mental health impact, fear of COVID-19, coping, and four validated scales assessing depressive symptoms, anxiety, worry, and loneliness used in previous waves during 2006-16. Number and chronicity of disorders were based on diagnoses in previous waves. Linear regression and mixed models were done. FINDINGS: The number and chronicity of disorders showed a positive graded dose-response relation, with greater perceived impact on mental health, fear, and poorer coping. Although people with depressive, anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive disorders scored higher on all four symptom scales than did individuals without these mental health disorders, both before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, they did not report a greater increase in symptoms during the pandemic. In fact, people without depressive, anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive disorders showed a greater increase in symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas individuals with the greatest burden on their mental health tended to show a slight symptom decrease. INTERPRETATION: People with depressive, anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive disorders are experiencing a detrimental impact on their mental health from the COVID-19 pandemic, which requires close monitoring in clinical practice. Yet, the COVID-19 pandemic does not seem to have further increased symptom severity compared with their prepandemic levels.

Clinical observations have shown that Qing-Fei-Da-Yuan (QFDY) granules have good anti-COVID-19 effects, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear. In this study, we explored the potential mechanism of QFDY with regard to its anti-COVID-19 effect. We first screened the active chemical constituents of QFDY based on the pharmacodynamic activity parameters, followed by screening with the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform. The Uniprot database was used for querying the corresponding genes of the target, and Cyoscape 3.6.1 software was used to construct the network of herb-compound-target. Protein interaction analysis, target gene function enrichment analysis, and signal pathway analysis were performed via STRING database, Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery, and KEGG Pathway database. Molecular docking was used to predict the binding capacity of the core compound with COVID-19 hydrolase 3CL and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The results showed that a network of herb-compound-target was successfully constructed, with key targets involving PTGS2, HSP90AA1, CAMKK2, NCOA2, and ESR1. Major metabolic pathways affected were those in cancer, procancer, nonsmall cell lung cancer, and apoptosis. The core compounds, such as quercetin, luteolin, and naringenin, showed a strong binding ability with COVID-19 3CL hydrolase; compounds such as anemasaponin C and medicocarpin showed a strong binding ability with ACE2. Thus, it is predicted that QFDY has the characteristics for multicomponent, multitarget, and multichannel overall control.

Nonetheless, explicit therapeutic drugs or clinically approved vaccines are not available for COVID-19. Thus, a comprehensive research is crucially needed to decode the pathogenic tools, plausible drug targets, committed to the development of efficient therapy. Host-pathogen interactions via host cellular components is an emerging field of research in this respect. miRNAs have been established as vital players in host-virus interactions. Moreover, viruses have the capability to manoeuvre the host miRNA networks according to their own obligations. Besides protein coding mRNAs, noncoding RNAs might also be targeted in infected cells and viruses can exploit the host miRNA network via ceRNA effect. We have predicted a ceRNA network involving one miRNA (miR-124-3p), one mRNA (Ddx58), one lncRNA (Gm26917) and two circRNAs (Ppp1r10, C330019G07RiK) in SARS-CoV infected cells. We have identified 4 DEGs-Isg15, Ddx58, Oasl1, Usp18 by analyzing a mRNA GEO dataset. There is no notable induction of IFNs and IFN-induced ACE2, significant receptor responsible for S-protein binding mediated viral entry. Pathway enrichment and GO analysis conceded the enrichment of pathways associated with interferon signalling and antiviral-mechanism by IFN-stimulated genes. Further, we have identified 3 noncoding RNAs, playing as potential ceRNAs to the genes associated with immune mechanisms. This integrative analysis has identified noncoding RNAs and their plausible targets, which could effectively enhance the understanding of molecular mechanisms associated with viral infection. However, validation of these targets is further corroborated to determine their therapeutic efficacy.","Arora, Shweta; Singh, Prithvi; Dohare, Ravins; Jha, Rishabh; Ali Syed, Mansoor",Gene,207,5

METHODS: This systematic review (PROSPERO: CRD42020210643) is according to PRISMA guidelines. PubMed, Cochrane, SciELO, Lilacs, Web of Science, and DOAJ databases were used. Clinical trials and research articles studying receptors related to COVID-19 were included in this review. R programming language was used to elaborate charts and receptors network and SPSS(26v) software was used to perform statistical analyses. RESULTS: The majority of studies regarding the involvement of receptors in COVID-19 included plasma receptors and G protein-coupled receptor families (p<0.05). These receptors are highly expressed in the brain (24%) and 80% of them can interact with each other in a protein network, exerting some regulatory effects in various tissues. The main influential receptor on the network of receptors involved in COVID-19 was the EGFR and the majority of receptors were associated with pathological processes in the disease (p<0.05), including the amplification of inflammatory responses in COVID-19, which may be related to neurological disorders in some cases. Humans from the United States, Spain, and Brazil were the most used model in studies adressing receptors involved in COVID-19 (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Plasma receptors and G protein-coupled receptors, especially the EGFR, and involved with pathological effects on the COVID-19 inflammatory process in the brain have shown significant importance in this review.","Câmara, Alice Barros; Brandão, Igor Augusto",Curr. med. chem,207,22

Palliative care consultation may benefit these patients and their families. Prior to the pandemic, our institution implemented a policy of automatic palliative care consultation for all patients on ECMO due to the high mortality, medical complexity, and psychosocial distress associated with these cases. OBJECTIVES: The main objective was to describe the role of the palliative care team for patients on ECMO for COVID-19 infection. The secondary objective was to describe the clinical outcomes for this cohort. DESIGN: Case series. SETTINGS/SUBJECTS: All patients age 18 or older infected by the novel coronavirus who required cannulation on ECMO from March through July of 2020, at an urban, academic medical center in the United States. Inter-disciplinary palliative care consultation occurred for all patients. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients (median age 43 years [range 28-64], mean body mass index 34.9 kg/m2 [SD 9.2], 65% Hispanic ethnicity) were cannulated on ECMO. Eleven patients died during the hospitalization (48%). Patients older than 50 years of age demonstrated a trend toward increased odds of death compared to those younger than 50 years of age (OR 9.1, P = 0.07). Patients received an average of 6.8 (SD 3.7) palliative clinical encounters across all disciplines. The actions provided by the palliative care team included psychosocial support and counseling, determination of surrogate decision maker (for 100% of patients), pain management (83%), and non-pain symptom management (83%). CONCLUSIONS: Here, we present one of the first studies describing the patient characteristics, outcomes, and palliative care actions for critically ill patients with COVID-19 on ECMO. Almost half of the patients in this cohort died during their hospitalization. Given the high morbidity and mortality of this condition, we recommend involvement of palliative care for patients/families with COVID-19 infection who are on ECMO. The impact of palliative care on patient and family outcomes, such as symptom control, satisfaction with communication, rates of anxiety, and grief experience merits further investigation.","Rao, Anirudh; Zaaqoq, Akram M; Kang, In Guk; Vaughan, Erin M; Flores, Jose; Avila-Quintero, Victor J; Alnababteh, Muhtadi H; Kelemen, Anne M; Groninger, Hunter",Am J Hosp Palliat Care,207,26

Little is known on whether and how patients regain the lost weight. We assessed changes in weight and abdominal adiposity over a three-month follow-up after discharge in COVID-19 survivors. METHODS: In this sub-study of a large prospective observational investigation, we collected data from individuals who had been hospitalized for COVID-19 and re-evaluated at one (V1) and three (V2) months after discharge. Patient characteristics upon admission and anthropometrics, waist circumference and hunger levels assessed during follow-up were analyzed across BMI categories. RESULTS: One-hundred-eighty-five COVID-19 survivors (71% male, median age 62.1 [54.3; 72.1] years, 80% with overweight/obesity) were included. Median BMI did not change from admission to V1 in normal weight subjects (-0.5 [-1.2; 0.6] kg/m2, p = 0.08), but significantly decreased in subjects with overweight (-0.8 [-1.8; 0.3] kg/m2, p < 0.001) or obesity (-1.38 [-3.4; -0.3] kg/m2, p < 0.001; p < 0.05 vs. normal weight or obesity). Median BMI did not change from V1 to V2 in normal weight individuals (+0.26 [-0.34; 1.15] kg/m2, p = 0.12), but significantly increased in subjects with overweight (+0.4 [0.0; 1.0] kg/m2, p < 0.001) or obesity (+0.89 [0.0; 1.6] kg/m2, p < 0.001; p = 0.01 vs. normal weight). Waist circumference significantly increased from V1 to V2 in the whole group (p < 0.001), driven by the groups with overweight or obesity.

They also examined whether findings differed between later versus earlier responders. METHODS: Between March 10 and March 31, 2020, a cross-sectional online survey was conducted with a nationally representative U.S. sample (n=6,684). Half responded before March 13, 2020 (versus later). Participants assessed their risks of COVID-19 infection and infection fatality (0%-100%) which were transformed into quartiles (1-4). They reported their implementation of protective behaviors like handwashing and social distancing (yes/no). Analyses were conducted in AprilâMay 2020. RESULTS: Median perceived risk was 10.00% for COVID-19 infection and 5.00% for infection fatality, but respondents showed large disagreement. An increase of 1 quartile in perceived infection risk was associated with being 1.45 times (95% CI=1.33, 1.58) more likely to report handwashing, with perceived infection fatality risk showing no significant association. When predicting social distancing behaviors such as avoiding crowds, both quartile-based risk perceptions were significant (OR=1.24, 95% CI=1.17, 1.30 for infection and OR=1.19, 95% CI=1.13, 1.26 for infection fatality). Perceived COVID-19 infection risk, protective behaviors, and their relationship increased among later (versus earlier) responders. CONCLUSIONS: Despite disagreements about the risks, people perceiving greater risks were more likely to implement protective behaviors-especially later (versus earlier) in March 2020. These findings have implications for risk communication.","Bruine de Bruin, Wändi; Bennett, Daniel",Am J Prev Med,207,20

Management of high-risk patients with early intervention is a key to lower the fatality rate of COVID-19 pneumonia, as a majority of patients recover naturally. Therefore, an accurate prediction of disease progression with baseline imaging at the time of the initial presentation can help in patient management. In lieu of only size and volume information of pulmonary abnormalities and features through deep learning based image segmentation, here we combine radiomics of lung opacities and non-imaging features from demographic data, vital signs, and laboratory findings to predict need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission. To our knowledge, this is the first study that uses holistic information of a patient including both imaging and non-imaging data for outcome prediction.

We recorded electroencephalography (EEG) of patients with right upper limb idiopathic focal dystonia and paired controls during resting state, writing-from-memory, and finger-tapping tasks. We applied power spectrum analyses considering the mu, beta and gamma rhythms of the motor cortex and analyzed brain connectivity networks and microstates. The power spectra results showed that patients had a loss of desynchronization of the beta rhythm during the writing task. We observed differences in the structure of the connective core in beta rhythm, as well as, in the intensity of the patient's hubs observed with basis in path length measures in mu and beta rhythms. Abnormalities were also identified in microstates of default mode networks of patients associated with its performances during motor tasks. The EEG connectivity analyses provided interesting insights about the cortical electrophysiological patterns in dystonia, such as loss of event-related desynchronization, changes in the effective connectivity with similar signature to other neurological diseases, indications of alterations in the default-mode-network.

METHODS: The Respiratory Protection Effectiveness Clinical Trial assessed respiratory infection incidence among HCP between 2011 and 2015. Research assistants obtained anterior nasal and oropharyngeal swabs from HCP in the workplace following development of respiratory illness symptoms and randomly while asymptomatic. Participants received take-home kits to self-collect swabs when absent from work. Samples mailed to a central laboratory were tested for respiratory viruses by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Among 2,862 participants, 3,467 swabs were obtained from symptomatic participants. Among symptomatic HCP, respiratory virus was detected in 904 of 3,467 (26.1%) samples. Self-collected samples by symptomatic HCP at home had higher rates of viral detection (40.3%) compared to 24% obtained by trained research assistants in the workplace (P < .001).

However, CQ and HCQ can have serious side effects, from psychiatric effects to sudden death. Therefore, a faster and more effective detection method is needed to monitor drug concentrations. In this review, a large study was conducted on the detection techniques and quantitative determination methods of CQ and its related metabolites. In this review, chromatography, electrophoresis, electroanalytical, spectroscopic, and immunological methods for CQ and related metabolites are discussed extensively.

Here, we highlight how COVID-19 threatens to jeopardize the tremendous gains made over the last few decades on improving children's health globally. Recent Findings: In contrast to adults, children with COVID-19 are less likely to develop severe disease requiring hospitalization or die as a direct result of infection. However, the pandemic will likely have other important health impacts disproportionately affecting vulnerable children globally. Possible effects include worsening of poverty and food insecurity; disruption of already strained routine child health services; damage to already imperiled healthcare workforces; a wave of mental health challenges; interruption of education; and increased risks of violence, abuse, exploitation, and neglect. These challenges notwithstanding, the response to COVID-19 may also provide opportunities, such as for health system strengthening, that could improve child health after the pandemic. Summary: The negative impacts of COVID-19 on global child health may be substantial. However, these are not foregone conclusions and much can be done to mitigate the worst outcomes. Child health providers should advocate for an equitable response to COVID-19 that prioritizes the health of vulnerable children and furthers the gains made in global child health.","Garcia-Prats, Anthony J; McAdams, Ryan M; Matshaba, Mogomotsi; Thahane, Lineo; Butteris, Sabrina M; Conway, James H; Slutsker, Mandy; St Clair, Nicole E; Haq, Heather",Curr Trop Med Rep,207,16

By performing a retrospective analysis, we evaluated the clinical data of recurrent positive coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients in multiple medical institutions in Wuhan. We recruited COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized from January 1 to March 10, 2020, in three tertiary hospitals in Wuhan, met the discharge criteria and received at least one additional nucleic acid test before leaving the hospital. According to the RT-PCR results, patients were split into a recurrent positive group (RPos group) and a nonrecurrent positive group (non-RPos group). Clinical characteristics, therapeutic schedules and antibody titers were compared between the two groups. AI-assisted chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) technology was applied to investigate pulmonary inflammatory exudation and compare the extent of lung areas with different densities. This study involved 122 COVID-19 patients. There were no significant differences in age, sex, preexisting diseases, clinical symptoms, clinical classification, course of disease, therapeutic schedules or serum-specific antibodies between the two groups. A higher proportion of patients who showed pulmonary inflammatory exudation on HRCT scans were recurrent positive at the time of discharge than other patients (81.6% vs 13.7%, P &lt; 0.01). In addition, the degree of pulmonary fibrosis was higher in the RPos group than in the non-RPos group (P &lt; 0.05). Subpleural exudation at the peripheral edge of the lung and extensive pulmonary fibrosis at the time of discharge represent risk factors for the recurrence of COVID-19. © 2021 E-Century Publishing Corporation.

This is unexpected for a virus with a low mutation rate due to an inherent proof-reading system. Could such a variant arise under very special conditions occurring in a host where the virus replicates and mutates in a rather unlimited fashion, such as in immune compromised patients? The virus was shown to replicate in an immunosuppressed cancer patient for more than 105 days and might be a source of new variants. These patients are asymptomatic and the virus may therefore escape detection and attention and be high-risk. Similarly, HIV-infected individuals may be immunocompromised and support coronavirus replication with increased mutation rates. The patients may promote ""within-host evolution"". Some of the viruses present in such a highly mutagenic swarm or quasispecies within one patient may become founders and cause a pandemic by further ""between-host evolution"". B.1.1.7 with 23 mutations may be such a case. Immunosuppressed patients can be identified and treated by the synthetic antibody cocktails as passive immunization and kept under control.

This meta-analysis aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of current option of therapies for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) besides COVID-19, in an attempt to identify promising therapy for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected patients. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Science and Technology Journal Database (VIP), and WANFANG DATA for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective cohort, and retrospective cohort studies that evaluated therapies (hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir-based therapy, and ribavirin-based therapy, etc.) for SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. The primary outcomes were mortality, virological eradication and clinical improvement, and secondary outcomes were improvement of symptoms and chest radiography results, incidence of acute respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS), utilization of mechanical ventilation, and adverse events (AEs). Summary relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random-effects models, and the quality of evidence was appraised using GRADEpro. Eighteen articles (5 RCTs, 2 prospective cohort studies, and 11 retrospective cohort studies) involving 4,941 patients were included. Compared with control treatment, anti-coronary virus interventions significantly reduced mortality (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.44-0.96; I2 = 81.3%), remarkably ameliorate clinical improvement (RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.05-2.19) and radiographical improvement (RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.11-2.36, I2 = 11.0 %), without manifesting clear effect on virological eradication, incidence of ARDS, intubation, and AEs. Subgroup analyses demonstrated that the combination of ribavirin and corticosteroids remarkably decreased mortality (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.27-0.68). The lopinavir/ritonavir-based combination showed superior virological eradication and radiographical improvement with reduced rate of ARDS. Likewise, hydroxychloroquine improved radiographical result. For safety, ribavirin could induce more bradycardia, anemia and transaminitis. Meanwhile, hydroxychloroquine could increase AEs rate especially diarrhea. Overall, the quality of evidence on most outcomes were very low. In conclusion, although we could not draw a clear conclusion for the recommendation of potential therapies for COVID-19 considering the very low quality of evidence and wide heterogeneity of interventions and indications, our results may help clinicians to comprehensively understand the advantages and drawbacks of each anti-coronavirus agents on efficacy and safety profiles. Lopinavir/ritonavir combinations might observe better virological eradication capability than other anti-coronavirus agents. Conversely, ribavirin might cause more safety concerns especially bradycardia. Thus, large RCTs objectively assessing the efficacy of antiviral therapies for SARS-CoV-2 infections should be conducted with high priority.","Zhong, Han; Wang, Yan; Zhang, Zai-Li; Liu, Yang-Xi; Le, Ke-Jia; Cui, Min; Yu, Yue-Tian; Gu, Zhi-Chun; Gao, Yuan; Lin, Hou-Wen",Pharmacol Res,207,16

We hypothesized that women giving birth to large-for-gestational-age (LGA) and small-for-gestational age (SGA) infants differed in longitudinal changes in lipoproteins, CETP activity and HDL-C and that placentas from women with higher or lower circulating HDL-C displayed differential expression of mRNAs involved in cholesterol/nutrient transport, insulin signaling, inflammation/ extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. Circulating lipids and CETP activity was measured during pregnancy, NMR lipidomics in late pregnancy, and associations with LGA and SGA infants investigated. RNA sequencing was performed in 28 placentas according to higher and lower maternal HDL-C levels. Lipidomics revealed high triglycerides in large VLDL and lipids/cholesterol/cholesteryl esters in small HDL in women giving birth to SGA infants. Placentas from women with higher HDL-C had decreased levels of CETP expression which was associated with mRNAs involved in cholesterol/nutrient transport, insulin signaling and inflammation/ECM remodeling. Both placental and circulating CETP levels were associated with growth of the fetus. Low circulating CETP activity at 36-38 weeks was associated with giving birth to SGA infants. Our findings suggest a link between increased maternal HDL-C levels, low CETP levels both in circulation and placenta, and SGA infants.","Roland, Marie Cecilie Paasche; Godang, Kristin; Aukrust, Pål; Henriksen, Tore; Lekva, Tove",Sci Rep,207,24

To uncover the SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome, we here develop a robust ribonucleoprotein (RNP) capture protocol and identify 109 host factors that directly bind to SARS-CoV-2 RNAs. Applying RNP capture on another coronavirus, HCoV-OC43, revealed evolutionarily conserved interactions between coronaviral RNAs and host proteins. Transcriptome analyses and knockdown experiments delineated 17 antiviral RBPs, including ZC3HAV1, TRIM25, PARP12, and SHFL, and 8 proviral RBPs, such as EIF3D and CSDE1, which are responsible for co-opting multiple steps of the mRNA life cycle. This also led to the identification of LARP1, a downstream target of the mTOR signaling pathway, as an antiviral host factor that interacts with the SARS-CoV-2 RNAs. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive list of RBPs regulating coronaviral replication and opens new avenues for therapeutic interventions.","Lee, Sungyul; Lee, Young-Suk; Choi, Yeon; Son, Ahyeon; Park, Youngran; Lee, Kyung-Min; Kim, Jeesoo; Kim, Jong-Seo; Kim, V Narry",Mol Cell,207,7

Results show that $mathcal{R}_t$ > 1 if the public's awareness to practice physical distancing is rela-tively low and $mathcal{R}_t$ < 1 otherwise. Simulations show that a reduced contact rate between the susceptible and asymptomatic/unreported symptomatic individuals is effective in mitigating the disease spread. Moreover, sensitivity analysis indicates that an increasing contact rate may lead to a second wave of disease outbreak. We also investigate the effectiveness of disease intervention strategies. Simulations demonstrate that enlarging the testing capacity and motivating infected individuals to test for an early diagnosis may facilitate mitigating the disease spread in a relatively short time. Results also indicate a significantly faster decline of confirmed positive cases if individuals practice strict physical distancing even if restricted measures are lifted.","Wang, Xiaoying",Math Biosci Eng,207,16

We recognize that many decisions are made based on the practical limitations that transplant programs face, especially at the extremes. As programs make the transition from a standard approach to a resource-constrained approach to transplantation, we utilize a framework for ethical decisions in settings of absolutely scarce resources to help guide programs in deciding which patients to transplant, which donors to accept, how to minimize risk, and how to ensure the best utilization of transplant team members.","Wall, Anji E; Pruett, Timothy; Stock, Peter; Testa, Giuliano",Am J Transplant,207,15

Additional cell receptors may be directly or indirectly involved, including integrins. The cytoplasmic tails of ACE2 and integrins contain several predicted short linear motifs (SLiMs) that may facilitate internalization of the virus as well as its subsequent propagation through processes such as autophagy. Here, we measured the binding affinity of predicted interactions between SLiMs in the cytoplasmic tails of ACE2 and integrin ß3 with proteins that mediate endocytic trafficking and autophagy. We validated that a class I PDZ-binding motif mediated binding of ACE2 to the scaffolding proteins SNX27, NHERF3, and SHANK, and that a binding site for the clathrin adaptor AP2 µ2 in ACE2 overlaps with a phospho-dependent binding site for the SH2 domains of Src family tyrosine kinases. Furthermore, we validated that an LC3-interacting region (LIR) in integrin ß3 bound to the ATG8 domains of the autophagy receptors MAP1LC3 and GABARAP in a manner enhanced by LIR-adjacent phosphorylation.

Here, we describe transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among >6800 youth and staff at YMCA of the Triangle day camps in North Carolina (March to August 2020). METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of deidentified SARS-CoV-2 cases reported by YMCA day camps in 6 counties (Chatham, Durham, Johnston, Lee, Orange, Wake) over 147 days. Inclusion criteria were youth and staff who enrolled or worked in camps during the study period. Individual-level youth and staff demographics (age, sex, race and ethnicity) were self-reported and linked to SARS-CoV-2 case data by using unique identifiers. RESULTS: Youth (n = 5344; 66% white, 54% male, mean age 8.5 years) had a mean camp attendance rate of 88%; staff (n = 1486) were 64% white and 60% female (mean age 22 years). Seventeen primary SARS-CoV-2 infections occurred during the study period among 9 youth (mean age 9.7 years) and 8 staff (mean age 27 years) who were linked to 3030 contacts present in-person during the week before positive cases. Only 2 secondary infections (1 youth and 1 staff) were linked to primary cases. SARS-CoV-2 primary case attack rate was 0.6% (17/3030), and secondary case transmission rate was 0.07% (2/3011). CONCLUSIONS: Extremely low youth and staff symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 attack and transmission rates were observed over a 147-day period across 54 YMCA camps from March to August 2020, when local coronavirus disease 2019 prevalence peaked. These findings suggest that the benefit of in-person programming in recreation settings with appropriate mitigation may outweigh the risk of viral transmission.","D039,; Agostino, Emily M; Armstrong, Sarah C; Humphreys, Lisa; Coffman, Stacey; Sinclair, Gordon; Permar, Sallie R; Akinboyo, Ibukunoluwa C",Pediatrics,207,0

METHODS: An instrumental study was carried out to assess the psychometric properties, validity, and reliability of the BSQ. The analysis of the measurement invariance was performed using the Least Squares Estimation, and weighted by adjusted variance and polychoric correlations after assessing different measurement models for BSQ in each group. The scores of the final version were correlated with anthropometric indicators by the Pearson correlation coefficient. RESULTS: As regards the dimensional analysis, all of the previous models for BSQ have favourable adjustment rates, although those with a single factor show more robust evidence. The configural invariance was accepted; suggesting that the one-dimensional structure is common for both men and women. However, 16-item factorial loadings were statistically different between the groups. Hence, they were discarded and an 18-item version (BSQ-18) was obtained, which is considered invariant as regards gender. In addition, there is a direct relationship between the scores of the BSQ-18 version and the body mass index, waist circumference, and fat percentage.

STUDY DESIGN: Children 1 month to 21 years of age with COVID-19 from a single tertiary care children's hospital between March 15 and April 13, 2020 were included. Demographic and clinical data were collected. RESULTS: In total, 67 children tested positive for COVID-19; 21 (31.3%) were managed as outpatients. Of 46 admitted patients, 33 (72%) were admitted to the general pediatric medical unit and 13 (28%) to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Obesity and asthma were highly prevalent but not significantly associated with PICU admission (P = .99). Admission to the PICU was significantly associated with higher C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and pro-B type natriuretic peptide levels and platelet counts (P < .05 for all). Patients in the PICU were more likely to require high-flow nasal cannula (P = .0001) and were more likely to have received Remdesivir through compassionate release (P < .05). Severe sepsis and septic shock syndromes were observed in 7 (53.8%) patients in the PICU. Acute respiratory distress syndrome was observed in 10 (77%) PICU patients, 6 of whom (46.2%) required invasive mechanical ventilation for a median of 9 days. Of the 13 patients in the PICU, 8 (61.5%) were discharged home, and 4 (30.7%) patients remain hospitalized on ventilatory support at day 14. One patient died after withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy because of metastatic cancer. CONCLUSIONS: We describe a higher than previously recognized rate of severe disease requiring PICU admission in pediatric patients admitted to the hospital with COVID-19.","Chao, Jerry Y; Derespina, Kim R; Herold, Betsy C; Goldman, David L; Aldrich, Margaret; Weingarten, Jacqueline; Ushay, Henry M; Cabana, Michael D; Medar, Shivanand S",J Pediatr,207,29

Mater. 7/2021),15.253499,5.5403666,2021,"Rationale: Immune stimulation with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has emerged as a highly effective treatment for several cancer types. Research also suggests these agents may be therapeutic for viral infections. However, by interrupting inhibitory signaling pathways, ICIs can cause immune-related adverse events including pneumonitis. A critical question during the present SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has been whether prior ICI treatment aggravates or improves virus-associated lung injury. Methods: To address this question, we first developed a lethal coronavirus acute lung injury model in A/J mice by infecting them intratracheally (IT) with mouse hepatitis virus-1 (MHV-1), a betacoronavirus that can be studied at Biosafety Level-2 (Study-1). We then investigated the effects of anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody (anti-PD-L1mAb;clone 10F.9G2, Bio X Cell) pretreatment on outcomes with MHV-1 lung challenge (Study-2). Results: In Study 1 testing 8 increasing doses of virus [5 to 2000 plaque forming units (PFU)/mouse], IT administration of 12.5 (n=8), 25 (n=8), or 50 (n=16) PFU/mouse produced lethality rates closest to 50% (Figure A). At 14d, surviving mice receiving any of these three doses had decreased circulating lymphocyte and increased lavage lymphocyte percentages and protein concentrations compared to diluent-challenged control animals (p≤0.04 averaged across the three MHV doses). Experiments in noninfected animals showed that compared to isotype-mAb (control) treatment, 4 doses of anti-PD-L1mAb (300μg/mouse) administered intraperitoneally every 3d significantly reduced lung immune cell PD-L1 expression (normalized mean fluorescence intensity, p=0.04;Figure B) and produced anti-PD-L1mAb levels at 14d consistent with those measured in ICI-treated cancer patients ( 283.2 ± 112.4 ug/mL). Therefore, in Study 2, mice were treated with either isotype-mAb or anti-PD-L1mAb (300ug/mouse, every 3 days) starting 12d before and continuing until 3d after IT challenge with 25 or 50PFU/mouse of MHV-1 (Experiments 1 and 2 respectively). Compared to control animals [12 survivors of 12 total animals in Experiment 1 (100%), and 4 of 12 in Experiment-2 (33%)], survival was decreased with PD-L1-mAb in both experiments [11 of 12, (91%) and 2 of 12 (17%), respectively] but these survival differences were not significant (p&gt;0.05) (Figure C). Conclusions: Intratracheal MHV-1 challenge in A/J mice produced lethality and late changes in circulating lymphocytes and lung lavage lymphocytes and protein that appear consistent with changes observed clinically with SARS-CoV2 infection. Prior treatment with anti-PD-L1mAb in this model did not improve and potentially aggravated the lethal effects of MHV-1, but requires further study.","Minkove, S.; Curan, C.

Aquatic and recreation centres in Victoria, Australia were recruited to co-develop and pilot pricing interventions within their onsite cafés, for 15 weeks from January 2019. A mixed method intervention evaluation was conducted. Interviews were conducted with food retail managers to understand the factors perceived to influence implementation, maintenance and effectiveness. Customer surveys assessed support for, and awareness of, interventions. Interrupted time series analysis estimated the impact of pricing interventions on food and beverage sales. Three centres each implemented a unique intervention: (i) discounted healthy bundles ('healthy combination deals'), (ii) offering deals at specific times of the day ('healthy happy hours') and (iii) increasing the prices of selected unhealthy options and reducing the prices of selected healthier options ('everyday pricing changes'). Café team leaders did not identify any significant challenges to implementation or maintenance of interventions, though low staff engagement was identified as potentially influencing the null effect on sales for healthy combination deals and healthy happy hours interventions. Customers reported low levels of awareness and high levels of support for interventions. Everyday pricing changes resulted in a significant decrease in sales of unhealthy items during the intervention period, though also resulted in a decrease in café revenue. Co-developed healthy food and beverage pricing interventions can be readily implemented with broad customer support. Everyday pricing changes have demonstrated potential effectiveness at reducing unhealthy purchases.","Huse, Oliver; Orellana, Liliana; Ferguson, Megan; Palermo, Claire; Jerebine, Alethea; Zorbas, Christina; Boelsen-Robinson, Tara; Blake, Miranda R; Peeters, Anna; Brimblecombe, Julie; Moodie, Marj; Backholer, Kathryn",Health promot. internation,207,1

Network DA exploits diverse sources of health data together with proximity data from mobile devices. In simulations of the early COVID-19 epidemic in New York City, network DA identifies up to a factor 2 more infections than contact tracing when harnessing the same diagnostic test data. Targeting contact interventions with network DA reduces deaths by up to a factor 4 relative to TTI, provided compliance reaches around 75%. Network DA can be implemented by expanding the backend of existing exposure notification apps, thus greatly enhancing their capabilities. Implemented at scale, it has the potential to precisely and effectively control the ongoing or future epidemics while minimizing economic disruption.","Schneider, Tapio; Dunbar, Oliver R.

There are quite many guidelines on COVID-19, but only a few on the management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) during COVID-19 pandemic. AIMS: We develop these recommendations to preserve adequate clinical practice for the management of HCC. METHODS: Experts of HCC in the Asia-Pacific region exchanged opinions via webinar, and these recommendations were formed. RESULTS: Close contact should be minimized to reduce possible exposure of both medical staff and patients to the novel coronavirus. To prevent transmission of the virus, meticulous hygiene measures are important. With the decrease in regular medical service, the medical staff may be mobilized to provide COVID-19-related patient care. However, diagnosis and treatment of HCC should not be delayed because of COVID-19 pandemic. The management of HCC should be the same as in non-pandemic circumstances. HCC is highly malignant, thus it is recommended not to delay curative treatment such as surgery and ablation. However, a kind of triage is necessary even among patients with HCC when resources are insufficient for all to be treated. Curative treatments should be periodized and cytoreductive or non-curative treatment such as vascular interventions and systemic therapy may be postponed until it can be performed safely with sufficient resources. For patients with confirmed or suspected to be infected with the novel coronavirus, diagnosis and treatment should be postponed until the virus is eliminated or they are confirmed as not being infected with it. CONCLUSIONS: These are collection of measures implemented by front-line medical professionals. We would evolve these recommendations over time as more real-world data becomes available.","Shiina, Shuichiro; Gani, Rino A; Yokosuka, Osamu; Maruyama, Hitoshi; Nagamatsu, Hiroaki; Payawal, Diana Alcantara; Dokmeci, A Kadir; Lesmana, Laurentius A; Tanwandee, Tawesak; Lau, George; Sarin, Shiv Kumar; Omata, Masao",Hepatol Int,207,15

The remote healthcare methodologies have achieved significant development based on reliable and low-latency transmissions of 5G. In remote health monitoring, the Internet of Things (IoT)-based physical monitoring devices need to transmit collected physical data in a real time and highly reliable manner to ensure accurate monitoring of patients. However, due to the unreliability of wireless link and the latency of data queue, it is a challenging issue to achieve high reliability communication and low delay transmission at the same time. Meanwhile, the available bandwidth is limited and the cost of renting spectrum is not negligible. Thus, it is essential for the devices to reduce communication costs while ensuring the efficient data transmission. Toward this end, our goal is to minimize the total costs of leasing bandwidth by jointly optimizing the access link and backhaul transmission, subject to the delay and reliability constraints. Considering the requirements of access link and queue together, a cost minimization problem is formulated, which is non-linear and non-convex and is hard to solve straightforwardly. Through problem equivalent transforming, a gradient descent-based algorithm is proposed to find a suboptimal solution. Simulation results validate the performance through cost, reliability, delay and those under harsh conditions.","Zheng, J. H.; Tian, H.; Ni, W.

We found a significant decrease of T lymphocyte subsets and an increase of inflammatory cytokines of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in clinical practice. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, single-center observational study of in-hospital adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Hubei Provincial Hospital of traditional Chinese and Western medicine (Wuhan, China) by Mar 1, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory information, especially T lymphocyte subsets and inflammatory cytokines were reported. For patients who died or discharge from hospital, the associations of T lymphocyte subsets on admission were evaluated by univariate logistic regression with odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), warning values to predict in-hospital death were assessed by Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: A total of 187 patients were enrolled in our study from Dec 26, 2019 to Mar 1, 2020, of whom 145 were survivors (discharge = 117) or non-survivors (in-hospital death ==28). All patients exhibited a significant drop of T lymphocyte subsets counts with remarkably increasing concentrations of SAA, CRP, IL-6, and IL-10 compared to normal values. The median concentrations of SAA and CRP in critically-ill patients were nearly 4- and 10-fold than those of mild-ill patients, respectively. As the severity of COVID-19 getting worse, the counts of T lymphocyte drop lower.28 patients died in hospital, the median lymphocyte, CD3+ T-cell, CD4+ T-cell, CD8+ T-cell and B-cell were significantly lower than other patients. Lower counts (/uL) of T lymphocyte subsets lymphocyte (<500), CD3+T-cell (<200), CD4+ T-cell (<100), CD8+ T-cell (<100) and B-cell (<50) were associated with higher risks of in-hospital death of CIVID-19. The warning values to predict in-hospital death of lymphocyte, CD3+ T-cell, CD4+ T-cell, CD8+ T-cell, and B-cell were 559, 235, 104, 85 and 82, respectively. CONCLUSION: We find a significant decrease of T lymphocyte subset is positively correlated with in-hospital death and severity of illness. The decreased levels of T lymphocyte subsets reported in our study were similar with SARS but not common among other virus infection, which may be possible biomarkers for early diagnosis of COVID-19. Our findings may shed light on early warning of high risks of mortality and help early intervention and treatment of COVID-19.","Xu, Bo; Fan, Cun-Yu; Wang, An-Lu; Zou, Yi-Long; Yu, Yi-Han; He, Cong; Xia, Wen-Guang; Zhang, Ji-Xian; Miao, Qing",J Infect,207,24

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Single academic medical center in New York City and Long Island. PARTICIPANTS: 5279 patients with laboratory confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) infection between 1 March 2020 and 8 April 2020. The final date of follow up was 5 May 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes were admission to hospital, critical illness (intensive care, mechanical ventilation, discharge to hospice care, or death), and discharge to hospice care or death. Predictors included patient characteristics, medical history, vital signs, and laboratory results. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to identify risk factors for adverse outcomes, and competing risk survival analysis for mortality. RESULTS: Of 11 544 people tested for SARS-Cov-2, 5566 (48.2%) were positive. After exclusions, 5279 were included. 2741 of these 5279 (51.9%) were admitted to hospital, of whom 1904 (69.5%) were discharged alive without hospice care and 665 (24.3%) were discharged to hospice care or died. Of 647 (23.6%) patients requiring mechanical ventilation, 391 (60.4%) died and 170 (26.2%) were extubated or discharged. The strongest risk for hospital admission was associated with age, with an odds ratio of >2 for all age groups older than 44 years and 37.9 (95% confidence interval 26.1 to 56.0) for ages 75 years and older. Other risks were heart failure (4.4, 2.6 to 8.0), male sex (2.8, 2.4 to 3.2), chronic kidney disease (2.6, 1.9 to 3.6), and any increase in body mass index (BMI) (eg, for BMI >40: 2.5, 1.8 to 3.4). The strongest risks for critical illness besides age were associated with heart failure (1.9, 1.4 to 2.5), BMI >40 (1.5, 1.0 to 2.2), and male sex (1.5, 1.3 to 1.8). Admission oxygen saturation of <88% (3.7, 2.8 to 4.8), troponin level >1 (4.8, 2.1 to 10.9), C reactive protein level >200 (5.1, 2.8 to 9.2), and D-dimer level >2500 (3.9, 2.6 to 6.0) were, however, more strongly associated with critical illness than age or comorbidities. Risk of critical illness decreased significantly over the study period. Similar associations were found for mortality alone. CONCLUSIONS: Age and comorbidities were found to be strong predictors of hospital admission and to a lesser extent of critical illness and mortality in people with covid-19; however, impairment of oxygen on admission and markers of inflammation were most strongly associated with critical illness and mortality. Outcomes seem to be improving over time, potentially suggesting improvements in care.","Petrilli, Christopher M; Jones, Simon A; Yang, Jie; Rajagopalan, Harish; O039,; Donnell, Luke; Chernyak, Yelena; Tobin, Katie A; Cerfolio, Robert J; Francois, Fritz; Horwitz, Leora I",BMJ,207,32

Interval breast cancer has a worse prognosis than cancers detected by screening; however, it is unknown whether the length of the interscreening period is associated with prognostic features and mortality. Objective: To compare the prognostic features and mortality rate of women with IBCs diagnosed within 1 year or between 1 and 2.5 years of a mammogram with negative results with the prognostic features and mortality rate of women with breast cancers detected by screening. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study used mammography data, tumor characteristics, and patient demographic data from the Women's Health Initiative study, which recruited participants from 1993 to 1998 and followed up with participants for a median of 19 years. The present study sample for these analyses included women aged 50 to 79 years who participated in the Women's Health Initiative study and includes data collected through March 31, 2018. There were 5455 incidents of breast cancer; only 3019 women compliant with screening were retained in analyses. Statistical analysis was performed from October 25, 2018, to November 24, 2019. Breast cancers detected by screening and IBCs were defined based on mammogram history, date of last mammogram, type of visit, and results of examination. Interval breast cancers were subdivided into those occurring within 1 year or between 1 and 2.5 years after the last protocol-mandated mammogram with negative results. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome of this study was breast cancer-specific mortality for each case of breast cancer detected by screening and IBCs detected within 1 year or between 1 and 2.5 years from a mammogram with negative results. Secondary outcomes included prognostic and tumor characteristics for each group. Comparisons between groups were made using the t test, the &#967;2 test, and Fine-Gray multivariable cumulative incidence regression analyses. Results: Among the 3019 participants in this analysis, all were women with a mean (SD) age of 63.1 (6.8) years at enrollment and 68.5 (7.1) years at diagnosis. A total of 1050 cases of IBC were identified, with 324 (30.9%) diagnosed within 1 year from a mammogram with negative results and 726 (69.1%) diagnosed between 1 and 2.5 years after last mammogram with negative results. The remaining 1969 cases were breast cancers detected by screening. Interval breast cancers diagnosed within 1 year from a mammogram with negative results had significantly more lobular histologic characteristics (13.0% vs. 8.1%), a larger tumor size (1.97 cm vs 1.43 cm), a higher clinical stage (28.4% vs 17.3% regional and 3.7% vs 0.6% distant), and more lymph node involvement (27.1% vs 17.0%) than cancers detected by screening. Unadjusted breast cancer-specific mortality hazard ratios were significantly higher for IBCs diagnosed within 1 year from a mammogram with negative results compared with breast cancers detected by screening (hazard ratio, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.39-2.65). Higher breast cancer-specific mortality remained statistically significant for IBCs diagnosed within 1 year after adjusting for trial group, molecular subtype, waist to hip ratio, histologic characteristics, and either tumor size (hazard ratio, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.03-2.08) or lymph node involvement (hazard ratio, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.03-2.01). However, significance was lost when tumor size and lymph node involvement were both included in the model (hazard ratio, 1.34; 95% CI, 0.96-1.88). Interval breast cancers diagnosed between 1 and 2.5 years from a mammogram with negative results were not different from breast cancers detected by screening based on prognostic factors or mortality. Conclusions and Relevance: Women with IBCs diagnosed within 1 year of negative mammogram results overall were associated with worse survival than women with breast cancers detected by screening. These differences in survival may be due to a uniquely aggressive biology among IBC cases.","Irvin, Veronica L; Zhang, Zhenzhen; Simon, Michael S; Chlebowski, Rowan T; Luoh, Shiuh-Wen; Shadyab, Aladdin H; Krok-Schoen, Jessica L; Tabung, Fred K; Qi, Lihong; Stefanick, Marcia L; Schedin, Pepper; Jindal, Sonali",JAMA Netw Open,207,26

Due to the recent outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia, novel chest X-ray (CXR) images that can be used for deep learning analysis are very rare. To solve this problem, we propose a deep learning framework that integrates a convolutional neural network and a capsule network. DenseCapsNet, a new deep learning framework, is formed by the fusion of a dense convolutional network (DenseNet) and the capsule neural network (CapsNet), leveraging their respective advantages and reducing the dependence of convolutional neural networks on a large amount of data. Using 750 CXR images of lungs of healthy patients as well as those of patients with other pneumonia and novel coronavirus pneumonia, the method can obtain an accuracy of 90.7% and an F1 score of 90.9%, and the sensitivity for detecting COVID-19 can reach 96%. These results show that the deep fusion neural network DenseCapsNet has good performance in novel coronavirus pneumonia CXR radiography detection.","Quan, Hao; Xu, Xiaosong; Zheng, Tingting; Li, Zhi; Zhao, Mingfang; Cui, Xiaoyu",Comput Biol Med,207,1

In radiology, social determinants of health lead to disparate use of imaging services through multiple intersecting contributors, on both the provider and patient side, affecting diagnosis and treatment. Disparities on the provider side include ordering of initial or follow-up imaging studies and providing standard-of-care interventional procedures, while patient factors include differences in awareness of screening exams and confidence in the healthcare system. Disparate utilization of mammography and lung cancer screening lead to delayed diagnosis, while differential provision of minimally invasive interventional procedures contributes to differential outcomes related to treatment. Interventions designed to mitigate social determinants of health could help to equalize the healthcare system. Here we review disparities in access and health outcomes in radiology. We investigate underlying contributing factors in order to identify potential policy changes that could promote more equitable health in radiology.","Abraham, Peter; Bishay, Anthony E; Farah, Isabella; Williams, Ellen; Tamayo-Murillo, Dorathy; Newton, Isabel G",Acad Radiol,207,10

The COVID-19 global pandemic is an ‘unprecedented crisis’ and has exposed the pitfalls of a hyper consumption model of economic growth and development. The scale of immediate economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic has shattered the myth of ‘catch up development’ and ‘perpetual growth’. The Crisis has brought unintended degrowth, presenting opportunities for an economic and social ‘reset’. In terms of long-term thinking post COVID-19, it is time to change the parameters of how we imagine a trajectory going forward, to prefigure possibilities for contesting capitalist imperatives that ‘there is no alternative’. In relation to tourism, the pandemic provides an opportunity for reimaging tourism otherwise, away from exploitative models that disregard people, places, and the natural environment, and towards a tourism that has positive impacts. Non-western alternatives to neo-colonial and neoliberal capitalism, such the South American concept of ‘Buen Vivir’, can help us to shift priorities away from economic growth, towards greater social and environmental wellbeing, and meaningful human connections. Taking a Buen Vivir approach to tourism will continue the degrowth momentum, for transformative change in society within the earth’s physical limits. Yet Buen Vivir also redefines the parameters of how we understand ‘limits’. In limiting unsustainable practices in development and tourism, a focus on Buen Vivir actually creates growth in other areas, such as social and environmental wellbeing, and meaningful human connection. Buen Vivir can reorient the tourism industry towards localised tourism, and slow tourism because the principles of Buen Vivir require these alternatives to be small-scale, local and benefiting host communities as well as tourists to increase the wellbeing for all.","Everingham, Phoebe; Chassagne, Natasha",Tour.

In 464 samples collected before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 (2017 and 2018), our virus neutralization assay had a 100% specificity. It was used to test 998 samples collected from blood donors during the last week of March or the first week of April 2020. As expected at this stage of the outbreak, the prevalence was low (2.7%) and, importantly, criteria for blood donation imply that the vast majority of seropositives had asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. Seroprevalence values did not differ significantly among age groups (but were slightly higher in donors <30yo and &#8805;60yo), and between males and females (2.82% vs 2.69%), unlike what has been observed regarding hospitalizations admission to ICU and death rates in France. By contrast, we observed that the proportion of seropositives was significantly lower in group O donors (1.32% vs 3.86% in other donors, p = 0.014). We conclude that virus infection seems to occur with a similar incidence in men and women among French blood donors, but that blood group O persons are less at risk of being infected and not only of suffering from severe clinical presentations, as previously suggested.","Gallian, Pierre; Pastorino, Boris; Morel, Pascal; Chiaroni, Jacques; Ninove, Laetitia; de Lamballerie, Xavier",Antiviral Res,207,20

ItOSS is a surveillance network that has been collecting data on maternal mortality and conducting population studies on obstetric near misses since 2013. At the beginning of the pandemic, ItOSS launched a new population-based project to monitor SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy and post-partum and promptly give back information useful to clinicians and decision-makers. All the regions and autonomous provinces, for a total of 289 birth units (PN), joined the study. Data relating to pregnant or post-partum women with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis addressing the maternities for outpatient visits or hospitalization were collected. The project methodology entails that each participating maternity reports the cases to ItOSS uploading data through an open-source platform. The on-line form includes sociodemographic and clinical data and maternal-neonatal outcomes. Biological samples to detect possible vertical transmission are also collected voluntarily. A total of 534 incident cases were reported from February 25th to July 10th 2020; 7 regions also collected biological samples for 227 cases; data collection is still ongoing.A preliminary analysis of the first 146 SARS-CoV-2 positive women who gave birth between February 25th to April 22nd shows an incidence rate of the infection equal to 2.1/1,000 in Italy and 6.9/1,000 in the Lombardy Region (Northern Italy). The brief time needed to setting up and operating the project, the national coverage, the adoption of shared tools for data collection, the quality and completeness of the information collected show how the availability of active networks like ItOSS represents a crucial element to hold a high level of preparedness in case of a health emergency.","Corsi, Edoardo; Maraschini, Alice; Perrone, Enrica; Salvatore, Michele Antonio; D039,; aloja, Paolo; Donati, Serana",Epidemiol Prev,207,16

Although less pathogenic than SARS-CoV, it has taken several lives and taken down the economies of many countries. Before this outbreak, the most recent coronavirus outbreaks were the SARS-CoV and the MERS-CoV outbreaks that happened in China and Saudi Arabia, respectively. Since the SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the same family as of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, they share several similarities. So, this review aims at understanding the new scenario of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and compares the epidemiology, clinical presentations, and the genetics of these coronaviruses. Studies reveal that SARS-CoV-2 is very similar in structure and pathogenicity with SARS-CoV, but the most important structural protein, i.e., the spike protein (S), is slightly different in these viruses. The presence of a furin-like cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 facilitates the S protein priming and might increase the efficiency of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 as compared to other beta coronaviruses. So, furin inhibitors can be targeted as potential drug therapies for SARS-CoV.","Rabaan, Ali A; Al-Ahmed, Shamsah H; Haque, Shafiul; Sah, Ranjit; Tiwari, Ruchi; Malik, Yashpal Singh; Dhama, Kuldeep; Yatoo, M Iqbal; Bonilla-Aldana, D Katterine; Rodriguez-Morales, Alfonso J",Infez Med,207,24

Currently, no effective treatment options are available for targeting SARS-CoV-2 infection. Repurposing of drugs such as chloroquine, thalidomide, and leflunomide alongside convalescent plasma is being employed as a therapeutic strategy. Clinical studies have shown that both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients can have an extremely active immune response that is largely attributable to immune system modulations. This includes cytokine storm syndrome (CSS), which affects the adaptive immune system, leading to exhaustion of natural killer (NK) cells and thrombocytopenia in some cases.

Due to high transmission levels, many governments implemented social distancing and confinement measures with different levels of required compliance to mitigate the COVID-19 epidemic. In several countries, these measures were effective, and it was possible to flatten the epidemic curve and control it. In others, this objective was not or has not been achieved. In far too many cities around the world, rebounds of the epidemic are occurring or, in others, plateaulike states have appeared, where high incidence rates remain constant for relatively long periods of time. Nonetheless, faced with the challenge of urgent social need to reactivate their economies, many countries have decided to lift mitigation measures at times of high incidence. In this paper, we use a mathematical model to characterize the impact of short duration transmission events within the confinement period previous but close to the epidemic peak. The model also describes the possible consequences on the disease dynamics after mitigation measures are lifted. We use Mexico City as a case study. The results show that events of high mobility may produce either a later higher peak, a long plateau with relatively constant but high incidence or the same peak as in the original baseline epidemic curve, but with a post-peak interval of slower decay. Finally, we also show the importance of carefully timing the lifting of mitigation measures. If this occurs during a period of high incidence, then the disease transmission will rapidly increase, unless the effective contact rate keeps decreasing, which will be very difficult to achieve once the population is released.","Santana-Cibrian, Mario; Acuña-Zegarra, Manuel A; Velasco-Hernandez, Jorge X",Math Biosci Eng,207,16

Fluorine introduction can be used for both purposes. Insights into how fluorine introduction affects lipophilicity are thus of importance, and systematic series of fluorinated compounds with measured octanol-water partition coefficients are a powerful way to enhance our qualitative understanding in this regard and are essential as input for computational logâ¯P estimation programs. Here, we report a detailed comparison of all possible vicinal and skipped (1,3-substituted) fluorination motifs when embedded in structurally equivalent environments (X-CFnH2-n-CFmH2-m-X versus X-CFnH2-n-CH2-CFmH2-m-X, with n,m &#8800; 0 and X = CH2OH) to compounds with isolated fluorination (n &#8800; 0; m = 0, and including X-CH2-CFnH2-n-CH2-X, n = 0-2). It is shown that skipped fluorination is more powerful for logâ¯P reduction purposes compared to single or vicinal fluorination. Efficient stereoselective syntheses of the compounds with skipped fluorination motifs are reported, which where relevant can be made enantioselective using known chiral building blocks. These compounds, and some intermediates, will be of interest as advanced fluorinated building blocks.","Troup, Robert I; Jeffries, Benjamin; Saudain, Raphael El-Bekri; Georgiou, Eleni; Fish, Johanna; Scott, James S; Chiarparin, Elisabetta; Fallan, Charlene; Linclau, Bruno",J Org Chem,207,20

The intravascular innate immune system (IIIS), including the complement, contact, coagulation, and fibrinolysis systems, which is crucial for recognizing and eliminating microorganisms and debris in the body, is likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 ARDS. Biomarkers for IIIS activation were studied in the first 66 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU in Uppsala University Hospital, both cross-sectionally on day 1 and in 19 patients longitudinally for up to a month, in a prospective study. IIIS analyses were compared with biochemical parameters and clinical outcome and survival. Blood cascade systems activation leading to an overreactive conjunct thromboinflammation was demonstrated, reflected in consumption of individual cascade system components, e.g., FXII, prekallikrein, and high molecular weight kininogen and in increased levels of activation products, e.g., C4d, C3a, C3d,g, sC5b-9, TAT, and D-dimer. Strong associations were found between the blood cascade systems and organ damage, illness severity scores, and survival. We show that critically ill COVID-19 patients display a conjunct activation of the IIIS that is linked to organ damage of the lung, heart, kidneys, and death. We present evidence that the complement and in particular the kallikrein/kinin system is strongly activated and that both systems are prognostic markers of the outcome of the patients suggesting their role in driving the inflammation. Already licensed kallikrein/kinin inhibitors are potential drugs for treatment of critically ill patients with COVID-19.","Lipcsey, Miklós; Persson, Barbro; Eriksson, Oskar; Blom, Anna M; Fromell, Karin; Hultström, Michael; Huber-Lang, Markus; Ekdahl, Kristina N; Frithiof, Robert; Nilsson, Bo",Front Immunol,207,28

METHODS: In June 2020, we conducted an online survey of parents and guardians of public school children in Illinois, Michigan, and Ohio. In a child-level analysis, we used linear regression to assess which demographic factors, health-related concerns, and parent/guardian views were associated with plans for in-person school attendance. In a respondent-level analysis, we used linear regression to assess factors associated with the number of risk mitigation measures supported. RESULTS: Among 2,202 children in the child-level analysis, in-person school attendance was planned for 71.0%. Such plans were less likely among children of Black respondents (-14.1 percentage points, 95% CI: -25.7, -2.6) and Asian respondents (-16.8, 95% CI: -31.3, -2.2), and among children with perceived high-risk health conditions (-9.7, 95% CI: -15.8, -3.6). Among 1,126 respondents in the respondent-level analysis, the mean number of measures supported was 8.0 (SD 4.4). Several factors were associated with support, but the magnitude of associations was generally modest. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, families of children with health conditions or who are of Black or Asian race/ethnicity may be less likely to opt for in-person learning. For these families, addressing barriers to remote education is critical. As schools plan for the 2020-2021 school year and beyond, they should respond to the desire among parents and guardians to implement substantial numbers of risk mitigation measures.","Chua, Kao-Ping; DeJonckheere, Melissa; Reeves, Sarah L; Tribble, Alison C; Prosser, Lisa A",,207,23

Given the easy access to multiple video conferencing platforms, many healthcare services have moved to an online delivery format (i.e. telehealth). It is important to monitor the behavioral and neural effects of telehealth interventions and resume neuroimaging research while adopting public health safety protocols to control the risk of COVID-19 transmission. We summarize existing safety protocols and our own experience from in-person functional near-infrared spectroscopy neuroimaging data collection (on-site, at home, and in outdoor settings), as well as potential opportunities of using online data sharing and low-cost, remote neuroimaging/electrophysiological techniques to continue brain research during the pandemic.","Su, Wan-Chun; Srinivasan, Sudha; Cleffi, Corina; Bhat, Anjana",Autism,207,1

Fangcang shelter hospital, which is converted from large-scale public venue, is proposed and proven to be an effective way for administering medical care and social isolation. This paper presents the practice in information technology support for a Fangcang shelter hospital in Wuhan, China. The experiences include the deployment strategy of IT infrastructure, the redesign of function modules in the hospital information system (HIS), equipment maintenance and medical staff training. The deployment strategy and HIS modules have ensured smoothness and efficiency of clinical work. The team established a quick response mechanism and adhered to the principle of nosocomial infection control. Deployment of network and modification of HIS was finished in the 48 hours before patient admittance. A repair hotline and remote support for equipment and software were available whenever medical workers met with any questions. No engineer ever entered the contaminated areas and no one was infected by the coronavirus during the hospital operation. Up to now, Fangcang shelter hospital is adopted by many regions around the world facing the collapse of their medical systems. This valuable experience in informatization construction and service in Wuhan may help participators involving in Fangcang shelter hospital get better information technology support, and find more practical interventions to fight the epidemic.","He, Qian; Xiao, Hui; Li, Han-Ming; Zhang, Bei-Bei; Li, Cheng-Wei; Yuan, Fang-Jian; Yu, Sha-Sha; Zhang, Fang; Kong, Ping",J Med Syst,207,23

With the COVID-19 pandemic showing a progressive spread throughout the countries of the world, there is emerging interest for the potential long-term consequences of suffering from a COVID-19 pneumonia. Imaging plays a central role in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 pneumonia, with chest X-ray examinations and computed tomography (CT) being undoubtedly the modalities most widely used, allowing for a fast and sensitive detection of infiltration patterns associated with COVID-19 pneumonia. For a better understanding of underlying pathomechanisms of pulmonary damage, longitudinal imaging series are warranted, for which CT is of limited usability due to repeated exposure of X-rays. Recent advances in MRI suggested that high-performance low-field MRI might represent a valuable method for pulmonary imaging without the need of radiation exposure. However, so far, low-field MRI has not been applied to study pulmonary damage after COVID-19 pneumonia. We present a case report of a patient who suffered from COVID-19 pneumonia using 0.55 T MRI for follow-up examinations three months after initial infection. Low-field MRI enables a precise visualization of persistent pulmonary changes including ground-glass opacities, which are consistent with CT performed on the same day. Low-field MRI seems to be feasible in the detection of pulmonary involvement in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and may have the potential for repetitive lung examinations in monitoring the reconvalescence after pulmonary infections.","Heiss, Rafael; Grodzki, David M; Horger, Wilhelm; Uder, Michael; Nagel, Armin M; Bickelhaupt, Sebastian",Magn Reson Imaging,207,16

A total of 1,097 participants residing in California who responded to at least one of three COVID-19 surveys were included in this analysis. Linear and generalized mixed-effects regression models were used to investigate relationships between individual contemplative practice behaviors (CPB) (embodied observing meditation, non-reactive mindfulness meditation, self-compassion cultivation, cultivation of compassion for others) and four psychosocial outcomes measured in the original WELL questionnaire (resilience, dealing with stress, positive emotions, and negative emotions). In addition, the associations between CPB and depression, distress, and compliance with local Shelter-In-Place orders were also investigated. Participants who engaged in any contemplative practice reported significantly more resilience and positive emotions, dealing better with stress, lower distress, and were less likely to report an experience with depression in the last week. Similar findings held when CPB was modeled as a continuous variable. Significant interactions between the duration of the SIP and CPB were also observed for resilience and SIP compliance outcomes, indicating that steeper declines were observed among participants with little or no CPB across the study period. Further investigation into the potential protective benefits of CPB during times of major disruption and uncertainty is warranted.","Chrisinger, Benjamin W.; Rich, Tia Lounsbury David Peng Katy Zhang Janice Heaney Catherine A.; Lu, Ying Hsing Ann W.",Preventive Medicine Reports,207,16

We use a mathematical model of viral coinfection to study SARS-CoV-2 coinfections, finding that SARS-CoV-2 replication is easily suppressed by many common respiratory viruses. According to our model, this suppression is because SARS-CoV-2 has a lower growth rate (1.8/d) than the other viruses examined in this study.

Nutritional therapy is a fundamental pillar in the management of hospitalized patients. It is broadly acknowledged that overfeeding and underfeeding of intensive care unit (ICU) patients are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to assess the energy demands of long-term ventilated COVID-19 patients using indirect calorimetry and to evaluate the applicability of established predictive equations to estimate their energy expenditure. METHODS: We performed a retrospective, single-center study in 26 mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients with resolved SARS-CoV-2 infection in three independent intensive care units. Resting energy expenditure (REE) was evaluated by repetitive indirect calorimetry (IC) measurements. Simultaneously the performance of 12 predictive equations was examined. Patient's clinical data were retrieved from electronic medical charts. Bland-Altman plots were used to assess agreement between measured and calculated REE. RESULTS: Mean mREE was 1687 kcal/day and 20.0 kcal relative to actual body weight (ABW) per day (kcal/kg/day). Longitudinal mean mREE did not change significantly over time, although mREE values had a high dispersion (SD of mREE ±487). Obese individuals were found to have significantly increased mREE, but lower energy expenditure relative to their body mass. Calculated REE showed poor agreement with mREE ranging from 33 to 54%. CONCLUSION: Resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by negative PCR leads to stabilization of energy demands at an average 20 kcal/kg in ventilated critically ill patients. Due to high variations in mREE and low agreement with calculated energy expenditure IC remains the gold standard for the guidance of nutritional therapy.","von Renesse, Janusz; von Bonin, Simone; Held, Hanns-Christoph; Schneider, Ralph; Seifert, Adrian M; Seifert, Lena; Spieth, Peter; Weitz, Jürgen; Welsch, Thilo; Meisterfeld, Ronny",Clin Nutr ESPEN,207,26

Os 100 dias da epidemia de COVID-19 resultaram em 52.213 casos e 4.235 óbitos entre 12 de março, correspondendo se 11, até 20 de junho de 2020 (semana epidemiológica 25). O pico da curva epidêmica ocorreu na semana epidemiológica 21 (23 de maio), seguido por desaceleração do número de casos. Detectou-se, inicialmente, a periferização dos casos na capital e região metropolitana, seguida por rápida disseminação para o interior do estado. Houve redução das taxas de crescimento médio diário a partir de abril, mas com patamar de mais de 6.000 casos semanais de COVID-19, em média. Ao final do período, a série de casos do estado indica persistência da circulação e transmissão comunitária do SARS-CoV-2.

Because of their epidemiological significance, vaccinations are considered compulsory in many countries and their evasion is penalized. Anti-vaccine movements may pose a threat to the epidemiological situation in many countries. The study presents the arguments formulated by opponents of vaccination and provides counter-arguments. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study is based on the analysis of data stored in scientific databases, information obtained from Google, Bing and Yahoo on the Internet, as well as newspapers, magazines and opinion-forming websites. RESULTS: The slogans propagated by anti-vaccination movements are usually based on easily proven erroneous theories and lies, although there are also arguments expressing belief in the conspiracy of governments, politicians and vaccine manufacturers, or incompetence of scientists and practitioners. CONCLUSIONS: In recent years in Poland, the activity of movements against vaccination has increased significantly, and their propaganda, through its negative impact on social attitudes, threatens to destabilize the epidemiological situation. Analysis of arguments used by the opponents of vaccination suggests a lack of reliable knowledge, religious overtones (addressed to people with fundamentalist personalities), or the ill-will attitudes of anti-vaccine individuals/groups used for their own purposes. Familiarization with the arguments of anti-vaccine propaganda is necessary in order to implement effective methods of fighting such attitudes and beliefs.","Kollataj, Witold Piotr; Kollataj, Barbara; Panasiuk, Lech; Sobieszczanski, Jaroslaw; Karwat, Irena Dorota",Ann Agric Environ Med,207,6

We use international comparisons as a starting point. METHODS: New York City, consisting of some 175 zip codes, is an ideal arena to pursue the above study given the large variation in case incidence rates across zip codes. We conducted systematic regression studies employing data with zip code granularity. Our model specifications are based on a well-established epidemiologic model that explains the effects of household sizes on R0. RESULTS: Average household size emerges as the single most important driver behind the large variation in COVID-19 incidence rates. It independently explains 62% of the variation. The percentage of the population above the age of 65 and the percentage below the poverty line are also strongly positively associated with zip code incidence rates. As to ethnic/racial characteristics, the percentages of African Americans, Hispanics and Asians within the population are significantly associated, but the magnitude of the impact is smaller. (The proportion of Asians within a zip code has a negative association.) Contrary to common belief, population density, by itself, does not have a significantly positive impact (other than when a high population is driven by large household sizes). CONCLUSION: Our findings support implemented and proposed policies to quarantine patients and separate infected individuals from families or dormitories; they also support newly revised nursing home admission policies.","Federgruen, Awi; Naha, Sherin",Int J Infect Dis,207,16

In January 2021, 200 participants under 50 years of age, located in 80 Chinese cities, participated in an online survey assessing risk perception, compliance with preventive behaviors, fear, anxiety, political trust, government dependency, and dispositional optimism. The results showed that the effect of risk perception on compliance with preventive behaviors was mediated by political trust and fear, and was moderated by government dependency. Anxiety and fear serially mediated the effect of optimism on compliance with preventive behaviors. Our study provided implications for future research to reduce negative emotions, strengthen confidence in the government, and sustain moderate government dependency accompanied by individual self-efficacy.","Wang, Jingjing; Rao, Nanyue; Han, Buxin",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),207,31

While a digital revolution has allowed for open access to large datasets enabling real-time tracking of the epidemic, detailed, locally-specific clinical data has been less readily accessible to a broad range of academic faculty and their trainees. This perpetuates the separation of the primary missions of clinically-focused and primary research faculty resulting in lost opportunities for improved understanding of the local epidemic; expansion of the scope of scholarship; limitation of the diversity of the research pool; lack of creation of initiatives for growth and dissemination of research skills needed for the training of the next generation of clinicians and faculty. ObjectivesCreate a common, easily accessible and up-to-date database that would promote access to local COVID-19 clinical data, thereby increasing efficiency, streamlining and democratizing the research enterprise. By providing a robust dataset, a broad range of researchers (faculty, trainees) and clinicians are encouraged to explore and collaborate on novel clinically relevant research questions. MethodsWe constructed a research platform called the Yale Department of Medicine COVID-19 Explorer and Repository (DOM-CovX), to house cleaned, highly granular, de-identified, continually-updated data from over 7,000 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (1/2020-present) across the Yale New Haven Health System. This included a front-end user interface for simple data visualization of aggregate data and more detailed clinical datasets for researchers after a review board process. The goal is to promote access to local COVID-19 clinical data, thereby increasing efficiency, streamlining and democratizing the research enterprise. Expected OutcomesO_LIAccelerate generation of new knowledge and increase scholarly productivity with particular local relevance C_LIO_LIImprove the institutional academic climate by: O_LIBroadening research scope C_LIO_LIExpanding research capability to more diverse group of stakeholders including clinical and research-based faculty and trainees C_LIO_LIEnhancing interdepartmental collaborations C_LI C_LI ConclusionsThe DOM-CovX Data Explorer and Repository have great potential to increase academic productivity. By providing an accessible tool for simple data analysis and access to a consistently updated, standardized and large-scale dataset, it overcomes barriers for a wide variety of researchers. Beyond academic productivity, this innovative approach represents an opportunity to improve the institutional climate by fostering collaboration, diversity of scholarly pursuits and expanding medical education.

CT is a widely used medical screening method used to obtain high resolution images of the human body. CT has been proven useful in the screening of the virus that is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic by allowing physicians to rule out suspected infections based on the appearance of the lungs from the CT scan. Based on this, we hereby propose an intelligent yet efficient CT scan-based COVID-19 classification algorithm that is able to discriminate negative from positive cases by evaluating the appearance of lungs. The algorithm is comprised of four main steps: preprocessing, features extraction, features reduction, and classification. In preprocessing, we employ the contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) to adjust the contrast of the image to enhance the details of the input image. We then apply the q-transform method to extract features from the CT scan. This method measures the grey level intensity of the pixels which reflects the features of the image. In the feature reduction step, we measure the mean, skewness and standard deviation to reduce overhead and improve the efficiency of the algorithm. Finally, “k-nearest neighbor”, “decision tree”, and “support vector machine” are used as classifiers to classify the cases. The experimental results show accuracy rates of 98%, 98%, and 98.25% for each of the classifiers, respectively. It is therefore concluded that the proposed method is efficient, accurate, and flexible. Overall, we are confident that the proposed algorithm is capable of achieving a high classification accuracy under different scenarios, which makes it suitable for implementation in real-world applications.","Al-Azawi, Razi J.; Al-Saidi, Nadia M.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to obtain more robust estimates of the incubation period, serial interval, frequency of presymptomatic transmission, and basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19 based on a large case series. METHODS: We systematically retrieved and screened 20,658 reports of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases released by the health authorities of China, Japan, and Singapore. In addition, 9942 publications were retrieved from PubMed and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) through April 8, 2020. To be eligible, a report had to contain individual data that allowed for accurate estimation of at least one parameter. Widely used models such as gamma distributions were fitted to the data sets and the results with the best-fitting values were presented. RESULTS: In total, 1591 cases were included for the final analysis. The mean incubation period (n=687) and mean serial interval (n=1015 pairs) were estimated to be 7.04 (SD 4.27) days and 6.49 (SD 4.90) days, respectively. In 40 cases (5.82%), the incubation period was longer than 14 days. In 32 infector-infectee pairs (3.15%), infectees' symptom onsets occurred before those of infectors. Presymptomatic transmission occurred in 129 of 296 infector-infectee pairs (43.58%). R0 was estimated to be 1.85 (95% CI 1.37-2.60). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides robust estimates of several epidemiological parameters of COVID-19. The findings support the current practice of 14-day quarantine of persons with potential exposure, but also suggest the need for additional measures. Presymptomatic transmission together with the asymptomatic transmission reported by previous studies highlight the importance of adequate testing, strict quarantine, and social distancing.","Ma, Shujuan; Zhang, Jiayue; Zeng, Minyan; Yun, Qingping; Guo, Wei; Zheng, Yixiang; Zhao, Shi; Wang, Maggie H; Yang, Zuyao",J Med Internet Res,207,24

Therefore, we analyzed the S gene sequences of SARS-CoV-2 to better understand the antigenicity and immunogenicity of this virus in this study. In phylogenetic analysis, two subtypes (SARS-CoV-2a and-b) were confirmed within SARS-CoV-2 strains. These two subtypes were divided by a novel synonymous mutation of D614G. This may play a crucial role in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 to evade the host immune system. The region containing this mutation point was confirmed as a B-cell epitope located in the S1 domain, and SARS-CoV-2b strains exhibited severe reduced antigenic indexes compared to SARS-CoV-2a in this area. This may allow these two subtypes to have different antigenicity. If the two subtypes have different serological characteristics, a vaccine for both subtypes will be more effective to prevent COVID-19. Thus, further study is urgently required to confirm the antigenicity of these two subtypes.","Kim, Sung-Jae; Nguyen, Van-Giap; Park, Yong-Ho; Park, Bong-Kyun; Chung, Hee-Chun",Vaccines,207,9

Protruding from the viral surface is a densely glycosylated spike (S) protein, which engages angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to mediate host cell entry. However, studies have reported viral susceptibility in intra- and extrapulmonary immune and non-immune cells lacking ACE2, suggesting that the S protein may exploit additional receptors for infection. Studies have demonstrated interactions between S protein and innate immune system, including C-lectin type receptors (CLR), toll-like receptors (TLR) and neuropilin-1 (NRP1), and the non-immune receptor glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78). Recognition of carbohydrate moieties clustered on the surface of the S protein may drive receptor-dependent internalization, accentuate severe immunopathological inflammation, and allow for systemic spread of infection, independent of ACE2. Furthermore, targeting TLRs, CLRs, and other receptors (Ezrin and dipeptidyl peptidase-4) that do not directly engage SARS-CoV-2 S protein, but may contribute to augmented anti-viral immunity and viral clearance, may represent therapeutic targets against COVID-19.","Gadanec, Laura Kate; McSweeney, Kristen Renee; Qaradakhi, Tawar; Ali, Benazir; Zulli, Anthony; Apostolopoulos, Vasso",Int. j. mol. sci.

The impact of COVID-19 on liver function is not well described. RESULTS: We found that the overall frequency of LFT abnormality was 17.6%. Frequency of LFT abnormality was significantly greater in patients with severe/critical (SC) COVID-19 compared to those with mild/moderate (MM) COVID-19 (32.4% vs 11.6%, p=0.011). Among patients with LFT abnormality, the median age was significantly higher in the SC group compared to the MM group (52 vs 39 years, p=0.021). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is frequently associated with mild liver function abnormality, particularly in individuals with severe/critical COVID-19 who were older. Liver function should be monitored carefully during infection, with judicious use of hepatotoxic agents where possible and avoidance of prolonged hypotension to minimize liver injury in older patients. METHODS: The No. 2 People's Hospital of Fuyang City in China has admitted a total of 159 patients with confirmed COVID-19 since the outbreak from January 2020 to March 2020. We analyzed the incidence of liver function test (LFT) abnormality in these patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection.","Li, Shasha; Li, Jinsong; Zhang, Zhenhua; Tan, Lin; Shao, Tuo; Li, Ming; Li, Xiuyong; Holmes, Jacinta A; Lin, Wenyu; Han, Mingfeng",Aging (Albany NY),207,24

There is a need to design a simple, low-cost, waterproof breath shield to minimise risk of infection.Dimensions of the Haag-Streit slit lamp (model BM 900) were recorded to guide accurate design of the breath shield. A questionnaire was circulated among slit lamp users on their perceived risk and concern about SARS-CoV-2 transmission and their perception of how effective different designs of breath shields would be at protecting them from an infection. A number of breath shield prototypes were designed and trialled. Plan, Do, Study, Act (PDSA) cycles were used to improve the design. Materials used to create the breath shields included transparent A3 laminating pouches and laminator, two sheets of A4 paper, scissors, hole punch and a ruler. The breath shield was designed to fit over the objective lens on the slit lamp after temporarily removing the standard, manufacturer-provided breath shield, before replacing it. The breath shields were cleaned after every patient with alcohol wipes and removed for deep cleaning with hand soap and water after each session. We used a proof of concept experiment using fluorescein instilled spray to test the effectiveness of each breath shield at preventing droplet transmission to the slit lamp user.Following four PDSA cycles, a breath shield that is user-friendly, easy to clean was produced. The percentage of confidence that the final design would be effective at preventing droplet transmission increased from 5.6% to 80%.Implementation of a low cost, simple to make, transparent, waterproof breath shield together with other forms of person protective equipment (PPE) creates a safe working environment for clinicians and patients. This intervention can be readily replicated and modified for other slit lamp models.","Wu, Clara Hoi Ka; Jarrar, Zakariya; Harsum, Steven",,207,8

Achieving optimal nutritional treatment during these phases in critically ill patients is challenging. COVID-19 patients seem particularly difficult to feed due to gastrointestinal problems. Our aim was to describe measured resting energy expenditure (mREE) and feeding practices and tolerance during the acute and late phases of critical illness in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Observational study including critically ill mechanically ventilated adult COVID-19 patients. Indirect calorimetry (Q-NRG+, Cosmed) was used to determine mREE during the acute (day 0-7) and late phase (>day 7) of critical illness. Data on nutritional intake, feeding tolerance and urinary nitrogen loss were collected simultaneously. A paired sample t-test was performed for mREE in both phases. RESULTS: We enrolled 21 patients with a median age of 59 years [44-66], 67% male and median BMI of 31.5 kg/m2 [25.7-37.8]. Patients were predominantly fed with EN in both phases. No significant difference in mREE was observed between phases (p = 0.529). Sixty-five percent of the patients were hypermetabolic in both phases. Median delivery of energy as percentage of mREE was higher in the late phase (94%) compared to the acute phase (70%) (p = 0.001). Urinary nitrogen losses were significant higher in the late phase (p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: In both the acute and late phase, the majority of the patients were hypermetabolic and fed enterally. In the acute phase patients were fed hypocaloric whereas in the late phase this was almost normocaloric, conform ESPEN guidelines. No significant difference in mREE was observed between phases. Hypermetabolism in both phases in conjunction with an increasing loss of urinary nitrogen may indicate that COVID-19 patients remain in a prolonged acute, catabolic phase.","Lakenman, P L M; van der Hoven, B; Schuijs, J M; Eveleens, R D; van Bommel, J; Olieman, J F; Joosten, K F M",Clin Nutr ESPEN,207,1

The health emergency caused closure of schools, and online distance education became a temporary solution, creating discomfort for many teachers for whom this was the first time engaged with online education. In our research we investigated two important dimensions, namely, how technology was used and what the newfound distance meant in terms of the teacher-student relationship. The article offers insights into experiences of teaching from lockdown reported by 41 teachers at primary, vocational and higher education level in the region of Vaud, Switzerland. This comparative qualitative research has provided an opportunity for an in-depth analysis of the main similarities and differences at three distinctly different educational levels and a possibility to learn more about common coping practices in teaching. The study gives a contribution to a lack of comparative studies of teacher experiences at different educational levels. Results show two dimensions in handling the lockdown crisis: mastering the digital tools and the importance of student-teacher interaction. Whilst the interviewed teachers largely overcame the challenges of mastering digital tools, optimizing the quality interaction and ensuring the transactional presence online remained a problem. This indicates the importance of the social aspect in education at all levels, and implies that teacher support needs to expand beyond technical pedagogical knowledge of online distance education.","Kovacs, Helena; Pulfrey, Caroline; Monnier, Emilie-Charlotte",Educ Inf Technol (Dordr),207,16

Colchicine is an anti-inflammatory drug that is being used in rheumatology for many years to treat mostly gout, calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease, and Familial Mediterranean Fever. Here, we present for the first time, two patients suffering from gout being treated with colchicine, who were affected from severe acute respiratory coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) syndrome. Both patients presented with mild symptoms of COVID-19 expressed with myalgias, arthralgias, and sore throat, while laboratory investigations showed only high acute phase reactants. Four weeks later, both patients were free of symptoms with negative SARS-CoV-2 tests and without any complications. To our knowledge, there are no other studies of gout arthritis and SARS-CoV-2 infection published so far. Thus, our preliminary conclusion is that chronic use of colchicine may mitigate the clinical picture and disease course of COVID-19 in gout arthritis patients. Further studies with a large number of patients are needed to confirm the above beneficial effect of colchicine.","Pelechas, Eleftherios; Drossou, Vassiliki; Voulgari, Paraskevi V; Drosos, Alexandros A",Rheumatol Int,207,29

Methods: Genome sequence information of SARS CoV-2-infected patients located in Turkey was obtained from the GISAID EpiCoV database. Structural analysis of spike proteins was done using bioinformatics tools (MAFFT, PSIPRED, ProMod3, PyMoL and DynOmics). Results: We identified 76 Thr&gt;Ile mutations in the N-terminal domain;468 Ile&gt;Val mutations in the receptor binding site and 614 Asp&gt;Gly, 679 Asn&gt;Lys, 771 Ala&gt;Val and 772 Val&gt;Ile mutations in the S1 subunit. It has been observed that the mutations, except those of residues 771 and 772, may cause significant conformational, topological and electrostatic changes in a protein quaternary structure. It has been determined that the mutations in the receptor binding site transform the protein structure into a formation that can mask the binding site and affect receptor affinity. Conclusions: It has been considered that SARS CoV-2 S glycoprotein mutations may cause changes in a protein functional structure that can affect the severity of disease. © 2021 Ekrem Akbulut, published by De Gruyter.

Ethical considerations prompt researchers to minimize the number of patients included in a trial. This gains particular importance when the disease is rare or lethal which is particularly so in the case of COVID-19. It is of paramount importance to explore some of the available tools that could help accelerate the adoption of any or some of the many proposed modalities for the treatment of diseases. These tools should be effective, yet efficient, for rapid testing of such treatments. Sequential analysis has not been frequently used in many clinical trials where it should have been used.

In addition to its usefulness when the results of new forms of treatment are quickly needed, other important benefit of sequential analysis includes the ability to reach a similar conclusion about the utility of a new drug without unduly exposing more patients to the side effect of the old drug, in particularly, for the treatment of a rare disease.","El Taguri, Adel; Nasef, Aisha",Libyan J Med,207,4

These positive influences are contextualized within extensive efforts within public health and healthcare management to calibrate community resilience frameworks and practices for utilization in everything from advancing community health to the continuity of facilities operations. Thereafter, the article shifts focus to speculate on how ongoing experiences under COVID might yield positive impacts for future resilience designs, plans and policies within housing and the built environment. Through this perspective, the article hopes to explore those often overlooked aspects of the physical and social parameters of the built environment that may be understood as providing opportunities to inform future disaster, public health, and climate change preparations and responses.","Keenan, Jesse M",Environ Syst Decis,207,16

The objective was to investigate the adherence of heads of French emergency departments (ED) and nursing departments on a potential vaccination campaign of healthcare workers (HCW) and patients in ED. METHOD: In February 2021, ED and nursing department heads were asked to answer a national survey. It included 24 questions designed to cover some dimensions, including characteristics of the hospital and emergency departments (ED) and questions on vaccination. RESULTS: 414 responses out of 800 questionnaires (51.8%) were collected. Scores out of 10 were, respectively, 7 (6-8) and 8 (6-9) for vaccination against influenza and COVID-19 for HCW and 2 (2-3) and 2 (2-4) for ED patients (H = 989.3;p &lt; 0.0001). Multivariate logistic regression found that the existence of a vaccine program in the hospital and the use of point of care influenza PCR in ED were positively associated with the acceptance of influenza vaccination campaign for HCW (p = 0.003) and patients (p = 0.015). Factors limiting adherence to a vaccination program of HCW and patients were lack of medical staff (p = 0.041 for HCW and p &lt; 0.0001 for patients), overcrowded ED (p &lt; 0.001), and the inability to follow up with patients after the ED visit (p &lt; 0.0001).

Vaccination campaigns in ED could help to improve vaccination coverage. ED staff are more likely to vaccinate HCW than patients. There are factors that support the implementation of such programs, which can be grouped into a culture of diagnosis, control, and prevention of viral infectious diseases within the hospital and ED.

Three major structural proteins, the spike, envelope and membrane proteins, are amongst several SARS-CoV-2 components synthesised at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of infected human cells prior to the assembly of new viral particles. Hence, the inhibition of membrane protein synthesis at the ER is an attractive strategy for reducing the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 and other obligate viral pathogens. Using an in vitro system, we demonstrate that the small molecule inhibitor ipomoeassin F (Ipom-F) potently blocks the Sec61-mediated ER membrane translocation and/or insertion of three therapeutic protein targets for SARS-CoV-2 infection; the viral spike and ORF8 proteins together with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the host cell plasma membrane receptor. Our findings highlight the potential for using ER protein translocation inhibitors such as Ipom-F as host-targeting, broad-spectrum antiviral agents.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.","O039,; Keefe, Sarah; Roboti, Peristera; Duah, Kwabena B; Zong, Guanghui; Schneider, Hayden; Shi, Wei Q; High, Stephen",J. cell. sci,207,32

Methods: Iron rod microdevices were constructed via template-guided synthesis and suspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 viruses were added to the samples and imaged with low-field MRI. Results: MRI of microdevices and viruses showed decreased signal intensity at low concentrations of viruses that recovered at higher concentrations. Electron micrographs suggest that reduced MRI intensity may be due to concentration-dependent shielding of water protons from local magnetic inhomogeneities caused by the iron microdevices.

METHODS: A 40-year-old man with bilateral acute conjunctivitis and no suspicious signs of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presented to the hospital. A detailed ophthalmic examination was performed. Samples obtained from conjunctival and nasopharyngeal swabs were tested by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) for detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Ocular findings and duration of the presence of viral RNA in the conjunctival specimens were evaluated at follow-up visits. RESULTS: Slit-lamp biomicroscopy revealed bilateral acute follicular conjunctivitis. The RT-PCR assay demonstrated the presence of viral RNA in the nasopharyngeal and conjunctival specimens at the initial visit and at the 4-day follow up. Conjunctivitis findings were decreased after 4 days and recovered completely without any sequelae within10 days. The PCR results of both nasopharyngeal and conjunctiva specimens were negative for the viral RNA at 10 days. CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral conjunctivitis is rare in patients infected with COVID-19. Although it is difficult to detect viral RNA from conjunctival swabs, conjunctival secretions may be a source of contamination and protective measures must be taken.","Sirakaya, Ender; Sahiner, Mustafa; Sirakaya, Hatice Aslan",Cornea,207,19

This retrospective cohort study was conducted on patients who were admitted to Ufuk University Hospital with dermatologic complaints/diseases before and during the pandemic. The patients were divided into two groups: (a) the pre-pandemic period (March-May 2019) and (b) the Pandemic period (March-May 2020). Demographic features, clinical characteristics, dermatologic diseases/complaints, dermatologic procedures/interventions, hospitalization rate, and use of biologic agents were compared between the two groups. Total number of hospital admissions have decreased from 1165 to 717. Admission rates for acne, dermatophytosis, and benign neoplasm of the skin significantly lower during the pandemic period (P values were .02, .04, and .006, respectively). Contact dermatitis, acne accompanying dermatitis, cicatricial hair loss, lichen planus, and zona zoster infection rates were significantly higher (P values were .007, <.001, .009, .04, and .03, respectively).

'Long COVID' involves the central nervous system (CNS), resulting in neuropsychiatric symptoms and signs, including cognitive impairment or 'brain fog' and chronic fatigue syndrome. There are similarities in these persistent complications between SARS-CoV-2 and the Ebola, Zika, and influenza A viruses. Normal CNS neuronal mitochondrial function requires high oxygen levels for oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production. Recent studies have shown that the SARS-CoV-2 virus can hijack mitochondrial function. Persistent changes in cognitive functioning have also been reported with other viral infections. SARS-CoV-2 infection may result in long-term effects on immune processes within the CNS by causing microglial dysfunction. This short opinion aims to discuss the hypothesis that the pathogenesis of long-term neuropsychiatric COVID-19 involves microglia, mitochondria, and persistent neuroinflammation.","Stefano, George B; Büttiker, Pascal; Weissenberger, Simon; Martin, Anders; Ptacek, Radek; Kream, Richard M",Med Sci Monit,207,16

Several gastrointestinal societies have released statements to protect patients and health care providers (HCPs). This study describes a barrier box that may be used as an adjunctive device in addition to personal protective equipment during endoscopies. Methods: A transparent acrylic box called ""Endoshield"" was created to place over patient's head and shoulders and was tested for its ease of use for the endoscopist and suitability for patient size and position. Results: Twelve children (66.67%, male) with a median age of 9 years (range, 2-11 years) underwent emergency or urgent endoscopy between April and June 2020 during the COVID-19 outbreak. The most common presenting symptom was life-threatening gastrointestinal bleeding (8/12, 66.67%), while the rest had urgent symptoms (4/12, 33.33%).

We sought to characterise patients discharged following a COVID-19 hospitalisation within a large integrated health system in the United States. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of 2180 COVID-19 patients discharged between 1 April 2020 and 31 July 2020. The primary endpoint was all-cause observation stay or inpatient readmission within 30 days from discharge. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to estimate the association between key socio-demographic and clinical characteristics with risk of 30-day readmission. RESULTS: The 30-day readmission rate was 7.6% (n = 166); 30-day mortality rate was 1% (n = 19). Most readmissions were respiratory-related (58%) and occurred at a median time of 5 days post discharge. Adjusted models showed that prior hospitalisations (Odds Ratio = 2.36, [95% Confidence Interval: 1.59-3.50]), chronic pulmonary disease (1.57 [1.09-2.28]), and discharge to home health (1.46 [1.01-2.11]) were significantly associated with 30-day readmission. Longer duration from diagnosis to index admission was borderline associated with lower odds of readmission (0.95 [0.91-1.00]). CONCLUSION: Readmission and mortality rates for COVID-19 following discharge are low. Most readmissions occur early and are due to respiratory causes and may reflect the prolonged acute disease course.","Huang, Cheng-Wei; Desai, Prashant P; Wei, Kenneth K; Liu, In-Lu Amy; Lee, Janet S; Nguyen, Huong Q",Infect Dis (Lond),207,6

This article studies multiple countries-based pandemic spread for the development of the COVID-19 originated in the China. This paper focuses on forecasting via real-time responses data to inherit an idea about the increase and maximum number of virus-infected cases for the various regions. In addition, it will help to understand the panic that surrounds this nCoV-19 for some intensely affecting states possessing different important demographic characteristics that would be affecting the disease characteristics. This study aims at developing soft-computing hybrid models for calculating the transmissibility of this genome viral. The analysis aids the study of the outbreak of this virus towards the other parts of the continent and the world. A hybrid of wavelet decomposed data into approximations and details then trained & tested through neuronal-fuzzification approach. Wavelet-based forecasting model predicts for shorter time span such as five to ten days advanced number of confirmed, death and recovered cases of China, India and USA. While data-based prediction through interpolation applied through moving average predicts for longer time spans such as 50–60 days ahead with lesser accuracy as compared to that of wavelet-based hybrids. Based on the simulations, the significance level (alpha) ranges from 0.10 to 0.67, MASE varying from 0.06 to 5.76, sMAPE ranges from 0.15 to 1.97, MAE varies from 22.59 to 6024.76, RMSE shows a variation from 3.18 to 8360.29 & R 2varying through 0.0018 to 0.7149. MASE and sMAPE are relatively lesser applied and novel measures that aimed to achieve increase in accuracy. They eliminated skewness and made the model outlier-free. Estimates of the awaited outburst for regions in this study are India, China and the USA that will help in the improvement of apportionment of healthcare facilities as it can act as an early-warning system for government policy-makers. Thus, data-driven analysis will provide deep insights into the study of transmission of this viral genome estimation towards immensely affected countries. Also, the study with the help of transmission concern aims to eradicate the panic and stigma that has spread like wildfire and has become a significant part of this pandemic in these times.","Bhardwaj, Rashmi; Bangia, Aashima",Chaos Solitons Fractals,207,24

Model outputs show strong qualitative-in some respects even quantitative-resemblance to the events of Spring 2020 in many cities worldwide. We then use this model to project forward in time to examine different paths in epidemic control after the initial surge is tamed and before the arrival of vaccines. Three very different control strategies are analyzed, leading to vastly different outcomes in terms of economic recovery and total infected population (or progress toward herd immunity). Our model, which is a version of the SEIQR model, is a time-dependent dynamical system with feedback-control.

While many COVID-19 trials have sought to manipulate SARS-CoV-2 or dampen the inflammatory response once patients are hospitalised, few examine therapeutics to prevent the need for hospitalisation. Colchicine is easily administered, generally well tolerated and inexpensive, and holds particular promise to reduce the risk of hospitalisation and mortality due to COVID-19 in the outpatient setting.

Here we investigated the relative efficiency of aerosol transmission of two variants of SARS-CoV-2, B.1.1.7 (alpha) and lineage A, in the Syrian hamster. A novel transmission caging setup was designed and validated, which allowed the assessment of transmission efficiency at various distances. At 2 meters distance, only particles <5 {micro}m traversed between cages. In this setup, aerosol transmission was confirmed in 8 out of 8 (N = 4 for each variant) sentinels after 24 hours of exposure as demonstrated by respiratory shedding and seroconversion. Successful transmission occurred even when exposure time was limited to one hour, highlighting the efficiency of this transmission route. Interestingly, the B.1.1.7 variant outcompeted the lineage A variant in an airborne transmission chain after mixed infection of donors. Combined, this data indicates that the infectious dose of B.1.1.7 required for successful transmission may be lower than that of lineage A virus. The experimental proof for true aerosol transmission and the increase in the aerosol transmission potential of B.1.1.7 underscore the continuous need for assessment of novel variants and the development or preemptive transmission mitigation strategies.","Port, Julia; Yinda, Kwe Claude; Avanzato, Victoria; Schulz, Jonathan; Holbrook, Myndi; Doremalen, Neeltje van; Shaia, Carl; Fischer, Robert; Munster, Vincent",,207,23

More than 6,973,427 confirmed cases were diagnosed in nearly 213 countries and territories around the world and two international conveyances, causing globally over 400,000 deaths. Epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients have been identified, but the factors influencing the immune system against COVID-19 have not been well established. Upon infection or cell damage, high amounts of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) are released from damaged cells, which serve as mediators of inflammation through purinergic cell surface receptor signaling. As a protective mechanism to prevent excessive damage to host tissue, adenosine counteracts ATP's effects by adenosine receptor stimulation to suppress the pro-inflammatory response. Adenosine is seen as a major obstacle to the efficacy of immune therapies, and the adenosinergic axis components are critical therapeutic targets for cancer and microbial infections. Pharmacologic inhibitors or antibodies specific to adenosinergic pathway components or adenosine receptors in microbial and tumor therapy have shown efficacy in pre-clinical studies and are entering the clinical arena. In this review, we provide a novel hypothesis explaining the potential for improving the efficiency of innate and adaptive immune systems by targeting adenosinergic pathway components and adenosine A2A receptor signaling for the treatment of COVID-19.","Abouelkhair, Mohamed A",Med Hypotheses,207,10

Adding on to the already existing burnout, an increase in incidents of violence and aggression against HCWs was seen in Pakistan and globally. Objectives: Primarily to review cases of violence against HCWs in Pakistan, highlighting and comparing the instigating factors seen within the country and globally. Secondly, to enlist possible interventions to counter workplace violence in healthcare during a pandemic and in general. Methods: Incidents of violence towards HCWs in Pakistan during the COVID-19 pandemic occurring between April 7, 2020, and August 7, 2020, were included. The incidents reported from local newspapers were reviewed. Findings and Conclusion: A total of 29 incidents were identified, with perpetrators of violence most commonly being relatives of COVID-19 patients. Most frequent reasons included mistrust in HCWs, belief in conspiracy theories, hospitals' refusal to admit COVID-19 patients due to limited space, COVID-19 hospital policies, and the death of the COVID-19 patients. Protests by doctors and other HCWs for provision of adequate PPE, better quarantine conditions for doctors with suspected COVID-19, and better compensation for doctors on COVID-19 patient duty resulted in police violence towards HCWs. To avoid such incidents in the future, institutions, healthcare policymakers, media organisations, and law enforcement agencies must work together for widespread public awareness to counter misconceptions and to exhibit responsible journalism. In hospitals, measures such as de-escalation training and increased security must be implemented. Furthermore, law enforcement agencies must be trained in non-violent methods of crowd dispersal and control to manage peaceful protests by HCWs over legitimate issues.","Bhatti, Omaima Anis; Rauf, Hareem; Aziz, Namrah; Martins, Russell Seth; Khan, Javaid A",Ann Glob Health,207,16

It is well known that despite the ease of bedside insertion, the use of nontunneled dialysis catheters (NTDCs) is associated with increased complications compared to tunneled dialysis catheters (TDCs). Our objective was to develop a strategy for TDC placement at the bedside to provide effective dialysis access, conserve resources and decrease personnel exposure at our medical center in an epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A technique for bedside TDC insertion with ultrasound and plain radiographs in the intensive care unit was developed. Test or clinically COVID-19-positive patients requiring RRT were evaluated for bedside emergent NTDC or nonemergent TDC placement. Patients who underwent NTDC placement were monitored for ongoing RRT needs and were converted to TDC at the bedside after 3-5 days. We prospectively collected patient data focusing on complications and mortality. RESULTS: Of the 36 consultations for dialysis access in COVID-positive patients from March 19 through June 5, 2020, a total of 24 bedside TDCs were placed. Only one patient developed a complication, which was pneumothorax and cardiac tamponade during line placement. In-hospital mortality in the cohort was 63.9%. CONCLUSIONS: Bedside TDC placement has served to conserve resources, prevent complications with transport to and from the operating room, and decrease personnel exposure during the COVID-19 pandemic. This strategy warrants further consideration and could be used in critically ill patients regardless of COVID status.","Williams, Austin D; Qaqish, Michael; Elnagar, Jaafar; Michos, Lia; Nantermet, Sebastian; Meisner, Robert; DiGiovanni, Vincent; Uribe, Alexander",Ann. vasc. surg,207,21

However, there is a need to identify best practices in the use of digital technologies to effectively reach, support, and manage care for patients living with SMDs. In this review, we summarize recent studies using digital technology to manage symptoms and support clinical care for this patient population and discuss new opportunities to advance digital psychiatry research and practice in LMICs. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies evaluating digital interventions for clinical populations living with SMDs in LMICs are limited. Yet, across recent articles surveyed, digital technology appears to yield diverse benefits for this at-risk patient population. These benefits include improved medication adherence, appointment adherence, reduced instances of relapse, and fewer re-hospitalizations. SUMMARY: Continued rigorous research evaluating effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of digital technologies in reaching, treating, and managing symptoms and supporting clinical care for patients with SMDs in LMICs is vital. The urgency for remote approaches for delivering specialized psychiatric care is particularly pronounced because of the immediate and long-term impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on access to in-person services. Future research should emphasize participatory approaches rooted in a process of codesign with target users, in order to achieve clinically effective remotely delivered digital mental health interventions.","Merchant, Rutvij; Torous, John; Rodriguez-Villa, Elena; Naslund, John A",Curr. opin. psychiatr,207,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a distributed, federated network of 12 health systems that harmonized their EHRs and submitted aggregate answers to consortia questions posted at https://www.covid19questions.org. Our consortium developed processes and implemented distributed algorithms to produce answers to a variety of questions. We were able to generate counts, descriptive statistics, and build a multivariate, iterative regression model without centralizing individual-level data. RESULTS: Our public website contains answers to various clinical questions, a web form for users to ask questions in natural language, and a list of items that are currently pending responses. The results show, for example, that patients who were taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers, within the year before admission, had lower unadjusted in-hospital mortality rates. We also showed that, when adjusted for, age, sex, and ethnicity were not significantly associated with mortality. We demonstrated that it is possible to answer questions about COVID-19 using EHR data from systems that have different policies and must follow various regulations, without moving data out of their health systems. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: We present an alternative or a complement to centralized COVID-19 registries of EHR data. We can use multivariate distributed logistic regression on observations recorded in the process of care to generate results without transferring individual-level data outside the health systems.","Kim, Jihoon; Neumann, Larissa; Paul, Paulina; Day, Michele E; Aratow, Michael; Bell, Douglas S; Doctor, Jason N; Hinske, Ludwig C; Jiang, Xiaoqian; Kim, Katherine K; Matheny, Michael E; Meeker, Daniella; Pletcher, Mark J; Schilling, Lisa M; SooHoo, Spencer; Xu, Hua; Zheng, Kai; Ohno-Machado, Lucila",J. am. med. inform. assoc,207,1

SUMMARY ANSWER: Adult offspring's receipt of identifying information about the sperm donor challenged the fathers' role as a parent, which was reflected in how parents positioned the donor in relation to the family. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: An increasing number of countries provide access to treatment with identity-release or 'open-identity' donors. However, there is limited knowledge about how parents experience and manage the situation when adult offspring obtain identifying information about the donor and may even establish contact with him. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This qualitative interview study included 23 parents whose offspring had obtained information about their sperm donor. Interviews were conducted from October 2018 to January 2019. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: A purposive sample of parents (15 mothers and 8 fathers) was recruited via adult offspring, who had requested identifying donor information at five Swedish University hospitals. All participating parents were part of a heterosexual couple who had conceived with sperm from an identity-release donor. Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted face-to face or via telephone, and transcribed audio recordings were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The parents expressed diverse experiences related to their parenthood and the presence of the donor after offspring had obtained information about him; these were described in two themes. The theme 'Navigating (in)visible markers of parenthood' describes parenthood as embedded with dichotomous meanings of nature and nurture that parents navigated in relation to social approval. The theme 'Positioning the donor in a new landscape' describes how parents managed the presence of the donor by positioning him at a distance or acknowledging him as a person or even as part of the family, while some struggled to position him, giving rise to ambivalent feelings. The absence of genetic connectedness challenged the father's role as parent, which was reflected in parents' positioning of the donor. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The study was performed within the context of the Swedish legislation on identity-release donation and is based on experiences of heterosexual couples who had used sperm donation and had informed their offspring about their donor conception. This, together with the fact that parents' accounts were predominantly represented by mothers, must be taken into consideration regarding transferability to other populations. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Negotiations of social and genetic parenthood are still present among parents many years after treatment and may resurface when adult offspring obtain the donor's identity. Access of the adult offspring to identifying information about the donor may have unexpected consequences for family relations, including expanding the family to include the donor. Challenges related to male infertility and family dynamics indicate that parents should have access to counseling and support to manage family life with varying genetic linkage within and outside the family unit. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): Financial support was from The Swedish Research Council (Grant 2013-2712). There are no conflicts of interest to declare.

Limited research has examined the role of built environments in relation to Indigenous health in remote Australia. This study engaged stakeholders to understand their perceptions of the influence of built environmental factors on chronic and infectious diseases in remote Northern Territory (NT) communities. A preliminary set of 1120 built environmental indicators were systematically identified and classified using an Indigenous Indicator Classification System. The public and environmental health workforce was engaged to consolidate the classified indicators (n = 84), and then sort and rate the consolidated indicators based on their experience with living and working in remote NT communities. Sorting of the indicators resulted in a concept map with nine built environmental domains. Essential services and Facilities for health/safety were the highest ranked domains for both chronic and infectious diseases. Within these domains, adequate housing infrastructure, water supply, drainage system, reliable sewerage and power infrastructure, and access to health services were identified as the most important contributors to the development of these diseases. The findings highlight the features of community environments amenable to public health and social policy actions that could be targeted to help reduce prevalence of chronic and infectious diseases.","Chakraborty, Amal; Howard, Natasha J; Daniel, Mark; Chong, Alwin; Slavin, Nicola; Brown, Alex; Cargo, Margaret",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),207,20

Scalp necrosis is very rare due to its rich vascularity. However, any post-traumatic wounds with secondary infection can lead to scalp necrosis. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 77-year-old Azerbaijani man with a history of diabetes who had a car accident and sustained a scalp wound. He underwent reconstructive surgery for the scalp wound. The wound became infected, and scalp necrosis developed following the surgery. There was no progress in wound healing in spite of conventional wound therapy. We combined maggot debridement therapy with negative-pressure wound therapy and amniotic membrane grafting for 7 months. Necrotic tissues began to be eliminated after the second use of larva therapy, and the wound became free of necrotic tissues with clear increase of granulated tissues after four treatments with maggot debridement therapy. Then, we applied negative-pressure wound therapy and amniotic membrane grafting to accelerate wound healing and improve wound closure. The patient's scalp wound recovered well, and he was discharged to home in good condition. CONCLUSIONS: Medical and wound care teams can benefit from this combination therapy when dealing with nonhealing necrotic wounds.","Hajmohammadi, Kazem; Esmaeili Zabihi, Roghayeh; Akbarzadeh, Kamran; Parizad, Naser",J Med Case Rep,207,2

We also constructed a predictive machine learning model based on chest CT and additional data to improve the diagnostic accuracy of chest CT. METHODS: This study's cohort consisted of 319 patients who underwent chest CT and RT-PCR testing at the ED. Patient characteristics, demographics, symptoms, vital signs, laboratory tests, and chest CT results (CO-RADS) were collected. With first RT-PCR as reference standard, the diagnostic performance of chest CT using the CO-RADS score was assessed. Additionally, a predictive machine learning model was constructed using logistic regression. RESULTS: Chest CT, with first RT-PCR as a reference, had a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 90.2%, 88.2%, 84.5%, and 92.7%, respectively. The prediction model with CO-RADS, ferritin, leucocyte count, CK, days of complaints, and diarrhea as predictors had a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 89.3%, 93.4%, 90.8%, and 92.3%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Chest CT, using the CO-RADS scoring system, is a sensitive and specific method that can aid in the diagnosis of COVID-19, especially if RT-PCR tests are scarce during an outbreak. Combining a predictive machine learning model could further improve the accuracy of diagnostic chest CT for COVID-19. Further candidate predictors should be analyzed to improve our model. However, RT-PCR should remain the primary standard of testing as up to 9% of RT-PCR positive patients are not diagnosed by chest CT or our machine learning model.","Hermans, Joep J R; Groen, Joost; Zwets, Egon; Boxma-De Klerk, Bianca M; Van Werkhoven, Jacob M; Ong, David S Y; Hanselaar, Wessel E J J; Waals-Prinzen, Lenneke; Brown, Vanessa",Emerg Radiol,207,26

Approximately half of the patients with discordant results (i.e., PCR positive and serology negative or vice versa) had mistimed tests in reference to the course of their disease. PCR-positive patients who were asymptomatic or pregnant were less likely to generate a detectable humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2.

Several vaccines have been approved by regulatory authorities and rolled out for use in different countries. Due to concerns of potential teratogenicity or adverse effect on maternal physiology, pregnancy has been a specific exclusion criterion for most vaccine trials with only two trials not excluding pregnant women. Thus, other than limited animal studies, gradually emerging development and reproductive toxicity data, and observational data from vaccine registries, there is a paucity of reliable information to guide recommendations for the safe vaccination of pregnant women. Pregnancy is a risk factor for severe COVID-19, especially in women with comorbidities, resulting in increased rates of preterm birth and maternal morbidity.

No available data exist so far regarding the safety, efficacy, and toxicology of these vaccines when administered during pregnancy. Most of the Obstetrics and Gynecology societies suggested that pregnant could agree to be vaccinated, after a thorough counseling of risks and benefits with their gynecologists, thus leading to an autonomous decision. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the attitude to coronavirus disease 2019 vaccination in pregnant and breastfeeding women in Italy. STUDY DESIGN: A survey was made at the University of Naples Federico II and the Ospedale Cristo Re, Tor Vergata University of Rome, on pregnant and breastfeeding women asking their perspectives on the available vaccines after reading the recommendations issued by our national Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Neonatology societies. The questionnaire included 12 items finalized to evaluate general features of the women and 6 items specifically correlated to their attitudes toward the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccination. Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests were used to compare group differences of categorical variables and Wilcoxon signed rank or Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables. The study was approved by the institutional review boards of the University of Naples Federico II (ref. no. 409/2020) and the Ospedale Cristo Re, Tor Vergata University of Rome (ref. #Ost4-2020). RESULTS: Most of the included women did not agree to eventually receive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccine during pregnancy (40 [28.2%] vs 102 [71.8%]). Being pregnant was considered a determinant factor to refuse the vaccine prophylaxis (99 [69.7%] vs 43 [30.3%]; chi-square test=24.187; P<.001), even if a very large percentage declared to be generally in favor of vaccines (128 [90.1%] vs 14 [9.9%]; chi-square test=6.091; P=.014) and most of them confirmed they received or would receive other recommended vaccines during pregnancy (75 [52.8%] vs 67 [47.2%]; chi-square test=10.996; P=.001). CONCLUSION: Urgent data are needed on the safety, efficacy, and toxicology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccines during pregnancy to modify this trend and to help obstetricians during the counseling.

Many nonurgent surgeries are delayed to preserve hospital resources, and patient visits to health care settings are limited to reduce exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Providers must carefully weigh risks and benefits of delivering immunosuppressive therapy during the pandemic. For breast cancer, a key difference is increased use of neoadjuvant systemic therapy due to deferral of many breast surgeries during the pandemic. In some cases, this necessitates increased use of genomic tumor profiling on core biopsy specimens to guide neoadjuvant therapy decisions. Breast cancer treatment during the pandemic requires multidisciplinary input and varies according to stage, tumor biology, comorbidities, age, patient preferences, and available hospital resources. We present here the Johns Hopkins Women's Malignancies Program approach to breast cancer management during the COVID-19 pandemic. We include algorithms based on tumor biology and extent of disease that guide management decisions during the pandemic. These algorithms emphasize medical oncology treatment decisions and demonstrate how we have operationalized the general treatment recommendations during the pandemic proposed by national groups, such as the COVID-19 Pandemic Breast Cancer Consortium.

The purpose of this quality improvement initiative was to identify lung cancer patients in our care who demonstrated increased levels of anxiety and distress directly related to the COVID-19 pandemic and to facilitate the acquisition of appropriate care to address their mental health needs. This initiative was designed to aid in the reduction of stress and anxiety in an already burdened population. Methods: The sample included 441 patients undergoing treatment for or surveillance of lung cancer who were screened from April 2020 to July 2020 through the Lung Cancer Evaluation Center. Using the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Distress Thermometer, patients were called and asked a series of questions regarding their distress levels in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. The NCCN tool uses a numeric scale from 0 to 10 to quantify level of distress, with 0 representing no distress and 10 indicating severe distress. Any patient scoring a 6 or greater was referred to the cancer center social worker. The social worker evaluated the patients' needs and formulated a plan. Any patient who reported a distress level between 3 and 5 was counseled by the nurse practitioner to evaluate further needs. Patients reported reasons for distress as fear of delayed testing, contracting the virus, and changes in their lifestyle (not seeing family, isolation, etc.). Results: We found that screening all patients during the pandemic yielded a higher than normal percentage of individuals who were in need of some level of mental health services. Cancer patients, particularly lung cancer patients, have increased fear due to the respiratory symptoms of COVID-19. After completion of this quality improvement initiative, we have incorporated distress assessment and triage protocols into our practice for all patients. Importance and Implications: Patients with underlying medical conditions including cancer know that they are at increased risk of complications from the COVID-19 virus. This may cause them increased anxiety, distress, and fear. Screening this population with phone calls can effectively identify patients at risk, and with the implementation of this initiative, we can ensure that those who feel isolated or experience heightened levels of distress receive the appropriate care they need.","Albano, Denise; Feraca, Melissa; Nemesure, Barbara",,207,1

DESIGN: Cross-sectional online survey. The participants filled out a questionnaire (developed by using Google Forms) that contained descriptive characteristics, nutritional behaviors, sleep patterns, physical activity status, anthropometric measurements, COVID-19-related level of knowledge, and the questions of the CES-Depression Scale through e-mail or social media (WhatsApp). SETTING: Turkey. PARTICIPANTS: 120 adult individuals who completed an online survey between April and May 2020. RESULTS: It was determined that 29.1% of the individuals showed mild, 34.2% moderate, and 23.4% severe depression symptoms during the pandemic period. A significant relationship was found between gender, age and educational status, marital status, and depression levels of the individuals, respectively (&#967;2=35.292, &#967;2=103.46, &#967;2=24.524, &#967;2=86.208 p<0.05).

The prevalence of co-infection and secondary infection in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 is not well understood. AIMS: To investigate the role of co-infections and secondary infections in disease severity of hospitalized individuals with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out between 11 January 2020 and 1 March 2020 among 408 laboratory confirmed COVID-19 patients in China. These patients were divided into three groups based on disease severity: mild or moderate, severe, or critically ill. Microbiological pathogens in blood, urine, and respiratory tract specimens were detected by the combination of culture, serology, polymerase chain reaction, and metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS). RESULTS: The median age of participants was 48 years (IQR 34-60 years). Fifty-two patients (12.7%) had at least one additional pathogen, 8.1% were co-infected, and 5.1% had a secondary infection. There were 13 Mycoplasma pneumoniae cases, 8 Haemophilus influenzae cases, 8 respiratory viruses, and 3 Streptococcus pneumoniae cases, primarily detected in mild and moderate COVID-19 patients. Hospital-acquired infection pathogens were more common in critically ill patients. Compared to those without additional pathogens, patients with co-infections and/or secondary infections were more likely to receive antibiotics (p < 0.001) and have elevated levels of d-dimer (p = 0.0012), interleukin-6 (p = 0.0027), and procalcitonin (p = 0.0002). The performance of conventional culture was comparable with that of mNGS in diagnosis of secondary infections. CONCLUSION: Co-infections and secondary infections existed in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and were relevant to the disease severity. Screening of common respiratory pathogens and hospital infection control should be strengthened.","Chen, Shuyan; Zhu, Qing; Xiao, Yanyu; Wu, Chi; Jiang, Zhaofang; Liu, Lei; Qu, Jiuxin",The clinical respiratory journal (Online),207,16

We investigated the association between IFN-&#945;-2b and the clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A total of 1401 patients were enrolled, with 852 (60.8%) patients receiving 5 000 000 U of IFN-&#945;-2b via aerosol inhalation twice daily. The primary outcome was a composite measure consisting of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death. A subgroup analysis was performed to investigate the impact of the IFN-&#945;-2b initiation schedule on symptom onset. RESULTS: The risk probability for crude endpoints was lower in the IFN-&#945;-2b group (3.8%) than in the non-IFN-&#945;-2b group (9.3%, P < .001). After adjusting the confounding factors, IFN-&#945;-2b therapy achieved a reduction of 64% in occurrence of endpoint events (hazard ratio, 0.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.21-0.62). In the subgroup analysis, compared with patients who received IFN-&#945;-2b treatment 0-2 days after symptom onset, the hazard ratio for endpoints was 2.2 (95% CI, 0.43-11.13) in patients who received the therapy 3-5 days after symptom onset, 5.89 (95% CI, 0.99-35.05) in patients who received the therapy 6-8 days after symptom onset, and remained at a high level thereafter. CONCLUSIONS: IFN-&#945;-2b aerosol inhalation therapy may be associated with improved clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19, and delayed IFN-&#945;-2b intervention was associated with increased probabilities of risk events. Further randomized clinical trials are needed to validate the preliminary findings of this study.","Yu, Jiong; Lu, Xuan; Tong, Ling; Shi, Xiaowei; Ma, Jing; Lv, Feifei; Wu, Jian; Pan, Qiaoling; Yang, Jinfeng; Cao, Hongcui; Li, Lanjuan",,207,32

The measures were widely believed to increase women's risk of violent victimization, most of which is by an intimate partner. We examined help-seeking during this period in a large U.S. city and used an interrupted time series analysis to assess the effects of three government interventions on domestic violence and sexual assault hotline calls and on ""911"" calls regarding domestic violence, assault, and rape. Declaration of an emergency appeared to reduce victim calls to the rape crisis hotline and the few ""911"" calls about rape. School closure was associated with a reduction in ""911"" calls about assault and rape and victim calls to the domestic violence hotline. Implementation of stay-at-home orders was associated with a gradual increase in domestic violence hotline calls. Although ""911"" calls regarding assault fell by nearly half, calls to police for domestic violence were unchanged. In sum, there was a decrease in help-seeking for sexual assault and assault in general but not for domestic violence during the initial phases of the COVID-19 outbreak. The analysis underscores the importance of distinguishing between the violence itself, calls to police, and calls to helplines when claims are made about changes over time in violence against women. The opportunities and constraints for each can differ widely under usual circumstances, circumstances that were altered by public health interventions related to the pandemic.","Sorenson, Susan B; Sinko, Laura; Berk, Richard A",J Interpers Violence,207,16

Two hundred and eighty-four patients completed a web-based or a paper survey on socio-demographic and clinical data. The psychiatric status was assessed using Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and MINI suicidality scale. Patients completed a checklist for the protracted symptoms that were experienced after the acute infection. After a mean of almost 50 days following the diagnosis, 98 patients (34.5%) reported clinically significant PTSD, anxiety, and/or depression, with PTSD being the most common condition reported (25.4%). One hundred and eighteen patients (44.3%) reported one or more protracted symptom(s). Predictors of PTSD symptom severity were the female gender, past traumatic events, protracted symptoms, stigmatization, and a negative view on the COVID-19 pandemic. PTSD symptom severity was the sole independent predictor of the protracted symptoms. Our results suggest that COVID-19 patients are prone to substantial psychological distress in the first few months after the infection. The protracted symptoms were frequent in this period, and these were closely related to the posttraumatic symptoms.","Poyraz, Burç Çagri; Poyraz, Cana Aksoy; Olgun, Yesim; Gürel, Özge; Alkan, Sena; Özdemir, Yusuf Emre; Balkan, Ilker Inanç; Karaali, Ridvan",Psychiatry Res,207,1

Nutrition composition was assessed using a software analyzing the frequency of food consumption. Two groups of children were distinguished: the main group (without dentoalveolar anomalies) and the comparison group (with bracket systems). The total sample size was 58 adolescents. It was found that in schoolchildren receiving orthodontic treatment the imbalance in the intake of macro- and micronutrients with diets is much higher than in schoolchildren of the main group. In the daily diet of the main group of children, adequate adequate energy value was noted (94.6% of the physiological requirements), in contrast to schoolchildren in the comparison group (76.7%). Diets in children of the main group are deficient in the content of total protein (90.1%) and carbohydrates (86.4%), and excess in fats (112.2%). In the comparison group, the intake of macronutrients with food averaged 77.7% of the norm. The limited use of certain foods in children with bracket systems has led to a significant deficit in diets of meat (70.0% of the recommended level of consumption), fish and seafood (37.6%), eggs (55.0%), bakery products (44.9%), potatoes (78.7%), vegetables (66.0%), fruits (51.6%). The installation of bracket systems for orthodontic treatment is necessary to eliminate dentoalveolar anomalies in children, but it becomes both a risk factor for the formation of nutritional disorders in patients and a risk factor for tooth enamel demineralization. Therefore, it is necessary to develop recommendations for correcting the nutrition of children during the period of orthodontic treatment.","Tapeshkina, M M; Kostritsin, A G; Tapeshkina, N V; Chernenko, S V",Stomatologiia (Mosk),207,1

In many cases this includes seeing patients through electronic means such as telehealth or telephone rather than seeing them in person. Asthma exacerbations cannot always be treated in this way. Problem: Current emergency unit asthma guidelines recommend bronchodilators be administered by metered dose inhaler (MDI) and spacer for mild-moderate asthma and include it as a choice even in severe asthma, but many emergency units continue to prefer nebulised therapy for patients who urgently require beta-agonists. The utilization of nebulised therapy potentially increases the risk of aerosolization of the coronavirus. Since nosocomial transmission of respiratory pathogens is a major threat in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, use of nebulised therapy is of even greater concern due to the potential increased risk of infection spread to nearby patients and health-care workers. Practical implications: We propose a risk stratification plan that aims to avoid nebulised therapy, when possible, by providing an algorithm to help better delineate those who require nebulised therapy. Protocols that include strategies to allow flexibility in using MDIs rather than nebulisers in all but the most severe patients should help mitigate this risk of aerosolised infection transmission to patients and health care providers. Furthermore, expedient treatment of patients with high dose MDI therapy augmented with more rapid initiation of systemic therapy may help ensure patients are less likely to deteriorate to the stage where nebulisers are required.","Levin, Michael; Morais-Almeida, Mario; Ansotegui, Ignacio J; Bernstein, Jonathan; Chang, Yoon-Seok; Chikhladze, Manana; Ebisawa, Motohiro; Fiocchi, Alessandro; Heffler, Enrico; Martin, Bryan; Papadopoulos, Nikolaos G; Peden, David; Wong, Gary W K",World Allergy Organ J,207,1

Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study included patients with clinically diagnosed or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 at 28 centers, representing 13 countries and 4 continents. The study was performed by the Global Consortium Study of Neurologic Dysfunction in COVID-19 (GCS-NeuroCOVID) from March 1 to September 30, 2020, and the European Academy of Neurology (EAN) Neuro-COVID Registry (ENERGY) from March to October 2020. Three cohorts were included: (1) the GCS-NeuroCOVID all COVID-19 cohort (n = 3055), which included consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19 with and without neurological manifestations; (2) the GCS-NeuroCOVID COVID-19 neurological cohort (n = 475), which comprised consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who had confirmed neurological manifestations; and (3) the ENERGY cohort (n = 214), which included patients with COVID-19 who received formal neurological consultation. Exposures: Clinically diagnosed or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Main Outcomes and Measures: Neurological phenotypes were classified as self-reported symptoms or neurological signs and/or syndromes assessed by clinical evaluation. Composite incidence was reported for groups with at least 1 neurological manifestation. The main outcome measure was in-hospital mortality. Results: Of the 3055 patients in the all COVID-19 cohort, 1742 (57%) were men, and the mean age was 59.9 years (95% CI, 59.3-60.6 years). Of the 475 patients in the COVID-19 neurological cohort, 262 (55%) were men, and the mean age was 62.6 years (95% CI, 61.1-64.1 years). Of the 214 patients in the ENERGY cohort, 133 (62%) were men, and the mean age was 67 years (95% CI, 52-78 years). A total of 3083 of 3743 patients (82%) across cohorts had any neurological manifestation (self-reported neurological symptoms and/or clinically captured neurological sign and/or syndrome). The most common self-reported symptoms included headache (1385 of 3732 patients [37%]) and anosmia or ageusia (977 of 3700 patients [26%]). The most prevalent neurological signs and/or syndromes were acute encephalopathy (1845 of 3740 patients [49%]), coma (649 of 3737 patients [17%]), and stroke (222 of 3737 patients [6%]), while meningitis and/or encephalitis were rare (19 of 3741 patients [0.5%]). Presence of clinically captured neurologic signs and/or syndromes was associated with increased risk of in-hospital death (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 5.99; 95% CI, 4.33-8.28) after adjusting for study site, age, sex, race, and ethnicity. Presence of preexisting neurological disorders (aOR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.80-2.75) was associated with increased risk of developing neurological signs and/or syndromes with COVID-19. Conclusions and Relevance: In this multicohort study, neurological manifestations were prevalent among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and were associated with higher in-hospital mortality. Preexisting neurological disorders were associated with increased risk of developing neurological signs and/or syndromes in COVID-19.","Chou, Sherry H-Y; Beghi, Ettore; Helbok, Raimund; Moro, Elena; Sampson, Joshua; Altamirano, Valeria; Mainali, Shraddha; Bassetti, Claudio; Suarez, Jose I; McNett, Molly",JAMA Netw Open,207,30

To this end, we describe how a computer-based monitoring system can support the delivery of the New Beginnings Program (NBP), a parent-focused evidence-based prevention program for divorcing parents. METHOD: We present NBP from a novel systems approach that incorporates social system informatics and engineering, both necessary when utilizing feedback loops, ubiquitous in implementation research and practice. Examples of two methodological challenges are presented: how to monitor implementation, and how to provide feedback by evaluating system-level changes due to implementation. RESULTS: We introduce and relate systems concepts to these two methodologic issues that are at the center of implementation methods. We explore how these system-level feedback loops address effectiveness, efficiency, and equity principles. These key principles are provided for designing an automated, low-burden, low-intrusive measurement system to aid fidelity monitoring and feedback that can be used in practice. DISCUSSION: As the COVID-19 pandemic now demands fewer face-to-face delivery systems, their replacement with more virtual systems for parent training interventions requires constructing new implementation measurement systems based on social system informatics approaches. These approaches include the automatic monitoring of quality and fidelity in parent training interventions. Finally, we present parallels of producing generalizable and local knowledge bridging systems science and engineering method. This comparison improves our understanding of system-level changes, facilitates a program's implementation, and produces knowledge for the field.

Potent humoral responses were detected within 3 weeks of onset of illness in all patients and the serological titre was elicited soon after or concomitantly with peripheral plasmablast response. An average of 13.7% and 13.0% of plasmablast-derived MAbs were reactive with virus spike glycoprotein or nucleocapsid, respectively. A subset of anti-spike (10 of 32) and over half of anti-nucleocapsid (19 of 35) antibodies cross-reacted with other betacoronaviruses tested and harboured extensive somatic mutations, indicative of an expansion of memory B cells upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Fourteen of 32 anti-spike MAbs, including five anti-receptor-binding domain (RBD), three anti-non-RBD S1 and six anti-S2, neutralised wild-type SARS-CoV-2 in independent assays. Anti-RBD MAbs were further grouped into four cross-inhibiting clusters, of which six antibodies from three separate clusters blocked the binding of RBD to ACE2 and five were neutralising. All ACE2-blocking anti-RBD antibodies were isolated from two recovered patients with prolonged fever, which is compatible with substantial ACE2-blocking response in their sera. At last, the identification of non-competing pairs of neutralising antibodies would offer potential templates for the development of prophylactic and therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2.","Huang, Kuan-Ying A; Tan, Tiong Kit; Chen, Ting-Hua; Huang, Chung-Guei; Harvey, Ruth; Hussain, Saira; Chen, Cheng-Pin; Harding, Adam; Gilbert-Jaramillo, Javier; Liu, Xu; Knight, Michael; Schimanski, Lisa; Shih, Shin-Ru; Lin, Yi-Chun; Cheng, Chien-Yu; Cheng, Shu-Hsing; Huang, Yhu-Chering; Lin, Tzou-Yien; Jan, Jia-Tsrong; Ma, Che; James, William; Daniels, Rodney S; McCauley, John W; Rijal, Pramila; Townsend, Alain R",PLoS Pathog,207,18

This study was aimed to report the impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak on visits and treatments for patients with ureteral stones in a general hospital ED. METHODS: The patients with ureteral stones were collected from 24 January to 24 March 2020 during the COVID-19 outbreak in Beijing. Two periods were divided for study: 24 January to 24 February (Period 1) and 25 February to 24 March (Period 2). Data on patients' characteristics, attendance, visual analog scale (VAS) scores, stone features, and final treatment choices were retrieved from the computer and compared with the data in the same periods in 2019. RESULTS: The study included 376 patients with ureteral stones during the COVID-19 outbreak periods in 2020 and 343 patients during the same periods in 2019. Compared with the same periods in 2019, the number of patients with ureteral stones was less in Period 1 (137 vs 163) but had a rebound phenomenon in Period 2 (239 vs 180). The visit frequency was significantly reduced (2.6 ± 0.4 vs 3.6 ± 0.8, p < 0.01) and the VAS scores and the onset time increased (7.7 ± 1.3 vs 5.5 ± 1.6, p < 0.01; 7.4 ± 1.8 vs 8.2 ± 1.5, p < 0.01, respectively) in Period 1. More patients chose oral analgesics medication to release from renal colic in the COVID-19 outbreak period instead of ESWL and intravenous analgesics medication (Period 1, 54.0% vs 20.2%, p < 0.01; Period 2, 20.9% vs 13.3%, p = 0.044; respectively). However, the percentage of patients underwent endoscopy surgery in outbreak period showed no significant difference compared with that in 2019. CONCLUSION: These results showed that the COVID-19 outbreak can directly affect the visits and final treatment choices for patients with ureteral stones.","Liu, Zhenhua; Man, Libo",Urologia,207,24

Registry data show that patients with cirrhosis may be at high risk. However, outcome comparisons among patients with cirrhosis+COVID-19 versus patients with COVID-19 alone and cirrhosis alone are lacking. The aim of this study was to perform these comparisons. DESIGN: A multicentre study of inpatients with cirrhosis+COVID-19 compared with age/gender-matched patients with COVID-19 alone and cirrhosis alone was performed. COVID-19 and cirrhosis characteristics, development of organ failures and acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) and mortality (inpatient death+hospice) were compared. RESULTS: 37 patients with cirrhosis+COVID-19 were matched with 108 patients with COVID-19 and 127 patients with cirrhosis from seven sites. Race/ethnicity were similar. Patients with cirrhosis+COVID-19 had higher mortality compared with patients with COVID-19 (30% vs 13%, p=0.03) but not between patients with cirrhosis+COVID-19 and patients with cirrhosis (30% vs 20%, p=0.16). Patients with cirrhosis+COVID-19 versus patients with COVID-19 alone had equivalent respiratory symptoms, chest findings and rates of intensive care unit transfer and ventilation. However, patients with cirrhosis+COVID-19 had worse Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI 6.5±3.1 vs 3.3±2.5, p<0.001), lower presenting GI symptoms and higher lactate. Patients with cirrhosis alone had higher cirrhosis-related complications, maximum model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score and lower BiPAP/ventilation requirement compared with patients with cirrhosis+COVID-19, but CCI and ACLF rates were similar. In the entire group, CCI (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.37, p<0.0001) was the only variable predictive of mortality on multivariable regression. CONCLUSIONS: In this multicentre North American contemporaneously enrolled study, age/gender-matched patients with cirrhosis+COVID-19 had similar mortality compared with patients with cirrhosis alone but higher than patients with COVID-19 alone. CCI was the only independent mortality predictor in the entire matched cohort.","Bajaj, Jasmohan S; Garcia-Tsao, Guadalupe; Biggins, Scott W; Kamath, Patrick S; Wong, Florence; McGeorge, Sara; Shaw, Jawaid; Pearson, Meredith; Chew, Micheal; Fagan, Andrew; de la Rosa Rodriguez, Randolph; Worthington, Janelle; Olofson, Amy; Weir, Vanessa; Trisolini, Calvin; Dwyer, Sarah; Reddy, K Rajender",Gut,207,24

It is therefore important to identify situations that carry high risk, and act early whenever such situations are identified. While a large number of mobile applications have been developed, they are aimed at obtaining information that can be used for contact tracing, but not at estimating the risk of social situations. In this paper, we introduce an infection risk score that provides an estimate of the infection risk arising from human contacts. Using a real-world human contact dataset, we show that the proposed risk score can provide a realistic estimate of the level of risk in the population. We also describe how the proposed infection risk score can be implemented on smartphones. Finally, we identify representative use cases that can leverage the risk score to minimize infection propagation.","Agarwal, Rachit; Banerjee, Abhik",,207,6

In Spain, the first wave was particularly severe among the population and health care professionals, many of whom were infected. These professionals required initial psychological supports that were gradual and in line with their conditions. OBJECTIVE: In the early days of the pandemic in Spain (March 2020), this study aimed to design and validate a scale to measure acute stress experienced by the health care workforce during the care of patients with COVID-19: the Self-applied Acute Stress Scale (EASE). METHODS: Item development, scale development, and scale evaluation were considered. Qualitative research was conducted to produce the initial pool of items, assure their legibility, and assess the validity of the content. Internal consistency was calculated using Cronbach &#945; and McDonald &#969;. Confirmatory factor analysis and the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test were used to assess construct validity. Linear regression was applied to assess criterion validity. Back-translation methodology was used to translate the scale into Portuguese and English. RESULTS: A total of 228 health professionals from the Spanish public health system responded to the 10 items of the EASE scale. Internal consistency was .87 (McDonald &#969;). Goodness-of-fit indices confirmed a two-factor structure, explaining 55% of the variance. As expected, the highest level of stress was found among professionals working in health services where a higher number of deaths from COVID-19 occurred (P<.05). CONCLUSIONS: The EASE scale was shown to have adequate metric properties regarding consistency and construct validity. The EASE scale could be used to determine the levels of acute stress among the health care workforce in order to give them proportional support according to their needs during emergency conditions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Mira, Jose Joaquin; Cobos, Angel; Martínez García, Olga; Bueno Domínguez, María José; Astier-Peña, María Pilar; Pérez Pérez, Pastora; Carrillo, Irene; Guilabert, Mercedes; Perez-Jover, Virtudes; Fernandez, Cesar; Vicente, María Asuncion; Lahera-Martin, Matilde; Silvestre Busto, Carmen; Lorenzo Martínez, Susana; Sanchez Martinez, Ascension; Martin-Delgado, Jimmy; Mula, Aurora; Marco-Gomez, Barbara; Abad Bouzan, Cristina; Aibar-Remon, Carlos; Aranaz-Andres, Jesus",JMIR Form Res,207,24

Given that, this study collected the most popular comments on 164 international COVID-19 events on Weibo to categorize different types of nationalism and measure the popularity index. The distribution of nationalism-categories across different topics was later estimated through semantic analysis, so as to explore how nationalism implies netizens' anti-globalization and pro-globalization sentiments. Specifically, the study categorized two different expressions of nationalism during the COVID-19 pandemic in China: a counterattack posture to external threats that is reflected as the Suppression of Ambivalent Attitudes, or a comparative response to global competition that serves as a stimulate to the Feeling of National Superiority. While the first expression is aligned with anti-globalization feelings, the second nationalistic sentiment stems from a sense of national superiority, which does not pose a threat to globalization.

The disease can evolve into acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ failure, due to viral spread in the blood and an excessive inflammatory reaction including cytokine storm. Antiviral and anti-cytokine drugs have proven to be poorly or in-effective in stopping disease progression, and mortality or serious chronic damage is common in severely ill cases. The low efficacy of antiviral drugs is probably due to late administration, when the virus has triggered the inflammatory reaction and is no longer the main protagonist. The relatively poor efficacy of anti-cytokine drugs is explained by the fact that they act on one or a few of the dozens of cytokines involved, and because other mediators of inflammation - reactive oxygen and nitrogen species - are not targeted. When produced in excess, reactive species cause extensive cell and tissue damage. The only drug known to inhibit the excessive production of reactive species and cytokines is methylene blue, a low-cost dye with antiseptic properties used effectively to treat malaria, urinary tract infections, septic shock, and methaemoglobinaemia. We propose testing methylene blue to contrast Covid-related acute respiratory distress syndrome, but particularly suggest testing it early in Covid infections to prevent the hyper-inflammatory reaction responsible for the serious complications of the disease.","Scigliano, Giulio; Scigliano, Giuseppe Augusto",Med Hypotheses,207,24

However, the role of a novel circRNA, circ_0079593, in melanoma is unclear. The expression levels of circ_0079593 and miR-516b were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Cell proliferation was measured by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, and cell migration and invasion were evaluated using transwell assay. Meanwhile, western blot (WB) analysis was employed to determine the levels of proliferation and metastasis-related proteins, as well as metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 (GRM3) protein. Furthermore, cell apoptosis was tested by detecting the cell apoptosis rate and Caspase-3 activity. The glucose consumption and lactate production of cells were measured to evaluate cell glucose metabolism. Moreover, dual-luciferase reporter assay and biotin-labeled RNA pull-down assay were used to confirm the interaction between miR-516b and circ_0079593 or GRM3. In addition, mice xenograft models were constructed to explore the effect of circ_0079593 on melanoma tumor growth in vivo. Our results discovered that circ_0079593 was highly expressed in melanoma, and its silencing suppressed melanoma cell proliferation, migration, invasion, glucose metabolism and promoted apoptosis. Moreover, we found that circ_0079593 could serve as a sponge of miR-516b, and miR-516b could target GRM3 in melanoma. The rescue experiments revealed that both miR-516b inhibitor and GRM3 overexpression could reverse the inhibition effect of circ_0079593 knockdown on melanoma progression. Additionally, in vivo experiments also revealed that circ_0079593 interference suppressed melanoma tumor growth. Our study concluded that circ_0079593 accelerated melanoma progression via upregulating GRM3 by sponging miR-516b, which suggested that circ_0079593 had the potential to be a new therapeutic biomarker for melanoma.","Lu, Jiajing; Li, Ying",Mol. cell. biochem,207,30

Understanding the relationships between health-system preparedness, responses to COVID-19, and the pattern of spread of the epidemic is particularly important in a country marked by wide inequalities in socioeconomic characteristics (eg, housing and employment status) and other health risks (age structure and burden of chronic disease). METHODS: From several publicly available sources in Brazil, we obtained data on health risk factors for severe COVID-19 (proportion of the population with chronic disease and proportion aged &#8805;60 years), socioeconomic vulnerability (proportions of the population with housing vulnerability or without formal work), health-system capacity (numbers of intensive care unit beds and physicians), coverage of health and social assistance, deaths from COVID-19, and state-level responses of government in terms of physical distancing policies. We also obtained data on the proportion of the population staying at home, based on locational data, as a measure of physical distancing adherence. We developed a socioeconomic vulnerability index (SVI) based on household characteristics and the Human Development Index. Data were analysed at the state and municipal levels. Descriptive statistics and correlations between state-level indicators were used to characterise the relationship between the availability of health-care resources and socioeconomic characteristics and the spread of the epidemic and the response of governments and populations in terms of new investments, legislation, and physical distancing. We used linear regressions on a municipality-by-month dataset from February to October, 2020, to characterise the dynamics of COVID-19 deaths and response to the epidemic across municipalities. FINDINGS: The initial spread of COVID-19 was mostly affected by patterns of socioeconomic vulnerability as measured by the SVI rather than population age structure and prevalence of health risk factors. The states with a high (greater than median) SVI were able to expand hospital capacity, to enact stringent COVID-19-related legislation, and to increase physical distancing adherence in the population, although not sufficiently to prevent higher COVID-19 mortality during the initial phase of the epidemic compared with states with a low SVI. Death rates accelerated until June, 2020, particularly in municipalities with the highest socioeconomic vulnerability. Throughout the following months, however, differences in policy response converged in municipalities with lower and higher SVIs, while physical distancing remained relatively higher and death rates became relatively lower in the municipalities with the highest SVIs compared with those with lower SVIs. INTERPRETATION: In Brazil, existing socioeconomic inequalities, rather than age, health status, and other risk factors for COVID-19, have affected the course of the epidemic, with a disproportionate adverse burden on states and municipalities with high socioeconomic vulnerability. Local government responses and population behaviour in the states and municipalities with higher socioeconomic vulnerability have helped to contain the effects of the epidemic. Targeted policies and actions are needed to protect those with the greatest socioeconomic vulnerability. This experience could be relevant in other low-income and middle-income countries where socioeconomic vulnerability varies greatly. FUNDING: None.

Comorbidities, in particular, diabetes and hypertension, clearly associated with age, besides obesity and smoke, are strongly associated with the need for intensive treatment and a dismal outcome. A weaker immunity of the elderly has been proposed as a possible explanation of this uneven age distribution. Thus, there is concern that children treated for cancer may allso be at risk for an unfavourable course of infection. Along the same line, anecdotal information from Wuhan, China, mentioned a severe course of COVID-19 in a child treated for leukaemia. AIM AND METHODS: We made a flash survey on COVID-19 incidence and severity among children on anticancer treatment. Respondents were asked by email to fill in a short Web-based survey. RESULTS: We received reports from 25 countries, where approximately 10,000 patients at risk are followed up. At the time of the survey, more than 200 of these children were tested, nine of whom were positive for COVID-19. Eight of the nine cases had asymptomatic to mild disease, and one was just diagnosed with COVID-19. We also discuss preventive measures that are in place or should be taken and treatment options in immunocompromised children with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Thus, even children receiving anticancer chemotherapy may have a mild or asymptomatic course of COVID-19. While we should not underestimate the risk of developing a more severe course of COVID-19 than that observed here, the intensity of preventive measures should not cause delays or obstructions in oncological treatment.","Hrusak, Ondrej; Kalina, Tomas; Wolf, Joshua; Balduzzi, Adriana; Provenzi, Massimo; Rizzari, Carmelo; Rives, Susana; Del Pozo Carlavilla, María; Alonso, Maria E V; Domínguez-Pinilla, Nerea; Bourquin, Jean-Pierre; Schmiegelow, Kjeld; Attarbaschi, Andishe; Grillner, Pernilla; Mellgren, Karin; van der Werff Ten Bosch, Jutte; Pieters, Rob; Brozou, Triantafyllia; Borkhardt, Arndt; Escherich, Gabriele; Lauten, Melchior; Stanulla, Martin; Smith, Owen; Yeoh, Allen E J; Elitzur, Sarah; Vora, Ajay; Li, Chi-Kong; Ariffin, Hany; Kolenova, Alexandra; Dallapozza, Luciano; Farah, Roula; Lazic, Jelena; Manabe, Atsushi; Styczynski, Jan; Kovacs, Gabor; Ottoffy, Gabor; Felice, Maria S; Buldini, Barbara; Conter, Valentino; Stary, Jan; Schrappe, Martin",Eur J Cancer,207,1

PATIENT(S): 1,347 pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 positive results registered consecutively between February 26 and November 5, 2020. INTERVENTION(S): The patients' information was collected from their medical records, and multivariable regression analyses were performed, controlling for maternal age and the clinical presentation of the infection. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Obstetrics and neonatal outcomes, pregnancy comorbidities, intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation need, and medical conditions. RESULT(S): The IVF group included 74 (5.5%) women whereas the spontaneous pregnancy group included 1,275 (94.5%) women. The operative delivery rate was high in all patients, especially in the IVF group, where cesarean section became the most frequent method of delivery (55.4%, compared with 26.1% of the spontaneous pregnancy group). The reason for cesarean section was induction failure in 56.1% of the IVF patients.

During decision-making, policymakers consider an estimate of the effective reproduction number Rt, which is the expected number of secondary infections spread by a single infected individual. Objective: We propose a simple method for estimating the time-varying infection rate and the Rt. Methods: We used a sliding window approach with a Susceptible-Infectious-Removed (SIR) model. We estimated the infection rate from the reported cases over a 7-day window to obtain a continuous estimation of Rt. A proposed adaptive SIR (aSIR) model was applied to analyze the data at the state and county levels. Results: The aSIR model showed an excellent fit for the number of reported COVID-19 cases, and the 1-day forecast mean absolute prediction error was &lt;2.6% across all states. However, the 7-day forecast mean absolute prediction error approached 16.2% and strongly overestimated the number of cases when the Rt was rapidly decreasing. The maximal Rt displayed a wide range of 2.0 to 4.5 across all states, with the highest values for New York (4.4) and Michigan (4.5). We found that the aSIR model can rapidly adapt to an increase in the number of tests and an associated increase in the reported cases of infection. Our results also suggest that intensive testing may be an effective method of reducing Rt.

There are many suggested ways to improve pain after rotator cuff surgery, but the effects of adopting a pathway that includes formal patient education, a long-acting nerve block, and extensive multimodal analgesia are unclear. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Does adoption of a clinical pathway incorporating patient education, a long-acting nerve block, and preemptive multimodal analgesia reduce the worst pain during the first 48 hours after surgery compared with current standard institutional practices? (2) Does adoption of the pathway reduce opioid use? (3) Does adoption of the pathway reduce side effects and improve patient-oriented outcomes? METHODS: From September 2018 to January 2020, 281 patients scheduled for arthroscopic ambulatory rotator cuff surgery were identified for this paired sequential prospective cohort study. Among patients in the control group, 177 were identified, 33% (58) were not eligible, for 11% (20) staff was not available, 56% (99) were approached, 16% (29) declined, 40% (70) enrolled, and 40% (70) were analyzed (2% [4] lost to follow-up for secondary outcomes after postoperative day 2). For patients in the pathway cohort, 104 were identified, 17% (18) were not eligible, for 11% (11) staff was not available, 72% (75) were approached, 5% (5) declined, 67% (70) enrolled, and 67% (70) were analyzed (3% [3] lost to follow-up for secondary outcomes after postoperative day 2). No patients were lost to follow-up for primary outcome; for secondary outcomes, four were lost in the control group and three in the pathway group after postoperative day 2 (p = 0.70). The initial 70 patients enrolled received routine care (control group), and in a subsequent cohort, 70 patients received care guided by a pathway (pathway group). Of the 205 eligible patients, 68% (140) were included in the analysis. This was not a study comparing two tightly defined protocols but rather a study to determine whether adoption of a pathway would alter patient outcomes. For this reason, we used a pragmatic (real-world) study design that did not specify how control patients would be treated, and it did not require that all pathway patients receive all components of the pathway. We developed the pathway in coordination with a group of surgeons and anesthesiologists who agreed to apply the pathway as much as was viewed practical for each individual patient. Patients in both groups received a brachial plexus nerve block with sedation. Major differences between the pathway and control groups were: detailed patient education regarding reasonable pain expectations with a goal of reducing opioid use (no formal educational presentation was given to the control), a long-acting nerve block using bupivacaine with dexamethasone (control patients often received shorter-acting local anesthetic without perineural dexamethasone), and preemptive multimodal analgesia including intraoperative ketamine, postoperative acetaminophen, NSAIDs, and gabapentin at bedtime, with opioids as needed (control patients received postoperative opioids but most did not get postoperative NSAIDS and no controls received gabapentin or separate prescriptions for acetaminophen). The primary outcome was the numerical rating scale (NRS) worst pain with movement 0 to 48 hours after block placement. The NRS pain score ranges from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain possible). The minimum clinically important difference (MCID) [12] for NRS that was used for calculation of the study sample size was 1.3 [18], although some authors suggest 1 [13] or 2 [5] are appropriate; if we had used an MCID of 2, the sample size would have been smaller. Secondary outcomes included NRS pain scores at rest, daily opioid use (postoperative day 1, 2, 7, 14), block duration, patient-oriented pain questions (postoperative day 1, 2, 7, 14), and patient and physician adherence to pathway. RESULTS: On postoperative day 1, pathway patients had lower worst pain with movement (3.3 ± 3.1) compared with control patients (5.6 ± 3.0, mean difference -2.7 [95% CI -3.7 to -1.7]; p < 0.001); lower scores were also seen for pain at rest (1.9 ± 2.3 versus 4.0 ± 2.9, mean difference -2.0 [95% CI -2.8 to -1.3]; p < 0.001). Cumulative postoperative opioid use (0-48 hours) was reduced (pathway oral morphine equivalent use was 23 ± 28 mg versus 44 ± 35 mg, mean difference 21 [95% CI 10 to 32]; p < 0.01). The greatest difference in opioid use was in the first 24 hours after surgery (pathway 7 ± 12 mg versus control 21 ± 21 mg, mean difference -14 [95% CI -19 to -10]; p < 0.01). On postoperative day 1, pathway patients had less interference with staying asleep compared with control patients (0.5 ± 1.6 versus 2.6 ± 3.3, mean difference -2.2 [95% CI -3.3 to -1.1]; p < 0.001); lower scores were also seen for interference with activities (0.9 ± 2.3 versus 1.9 ± 2.9, mean difference -1.1 [95% CI -2 to -0.1]; p = 0.03). Satisfaction with pain treatment on postoperative day 1 was higher among pathway patients compared with control patients (9.2 ± 1.7 versus 8.2 ± 2.5, mean difference 1.0 [95% CI 0.3 to 1.8]; p < 0.001). On postoperative day 2, pathway patients had lower nausea scores compared with control patients (0.3 ± 1.1 versus 1 ± 2.1, mean difference -0.7 [95% CI -1.2 to -0.1]; p = 0.02); lower scores were also seen for drowsiness on postoperative day 1 (1.7 ± 2.7 versus 2.6 ± 2.6, mean difference -0.9 [95% CI - 1.7 to -0.1]; p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Adoption of the pathway was associated with improvement in the primary outcome (pain with movement) that exceeded the MCID. Patients in the pathway group had improved patient-oriented outcomes and fewer side effects. This pathway uses multiple analgesic drugs, which may pose risks to elderly patients, in particular. Therefore, in evaluating whether to use this pathway, clinicians should weigh the effect sizes against the potential risks that may emerge with large scale use, consider the difficulties involved in adapting a pathway to local practice so that pathway will persist, and recognize that this study only enrolled patients among surgeons and the anesthesiologists that advocated for the pathway; results may have been different with less enthusiastic clinicians. This pathway, based on a long-lasting nerve block, multimodal analgesia, and patient education can be considered for adoption.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional internet-based survey was completed by 706 pregnant women (mean age 29.6 years ± 3.2) residing in the United States in May 2020 to assess self-reported changes in diet, physical activity, and sleep during the COVID-19 pandemic. Logistic regression analyses examined whether sociodemographic, clinical, and pandemic-related characteristics were associated with health behavior changes. RESULTS: Approximately 17% of women reported their diets worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic, 42% reported improvements, and 41% reported no change. For physical activity, 22% reported they stopped being active, 2% reported they became active, and 76% reported no change. Nearly one-third of participants reported getting less sleep. The factors consistently associated with adverse lifestyle changes (worse diet, stopped being active, and reduced sleep) were experiences of pregnancy complications, loss of income due to COVID-19, and changes in social connections due to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of pregnant women reported adverse lifestyle changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interventions during the pandemic to optimize health behaviors in pregnant women, especially among those with pregnancy complications, should address economic disadvantages and social support.","Whitaker, Kara M; Hung, Peiyin; Alberg, Anthony J; Hair, Nicole L; Liu, Jihong",Midwifery,207,16

To this end, viruses have adopted several strategies to harness cellular metabolism in accordance with their specific demands. Most viruses upregulate specific cellular anabolic pathways and are largely dependent on such alterations. RNA viruses, for example, upregulate both glycolysisand glycogenolysis providing TCA cycle intermediates essential for anabolic lipogenesis. Also, these infections usually induce the PPP, leading to increased nucleotide levels supporting viral replication. SARS-CoV-2 (the cause of COVID-19)that has so far spread from China throughout the world is also an RNA virus. Owing to the more metabolic plasticity of uninfected cells, a promising approach for specific antiviral therapy, which has drawn a lot of attention in the recent years, would be the targeting of metabolic changes induced by viruses. In the current review, we first summarize some of virus-induced metabolic adaptations and then based on these information as well as SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, propose a potential therapeutic modality for this calamitous world-spreading virus with the hope of employing this strategy for near-future clinical application.","Mansouri, Kamran; Rastegari-Pouyani, Mohsen; Ghanbri-Movahed, Maryam; Safarzadeh, Mehrnoush; Kiani, Sara; Ghanbari-Movahed, Zahra",Biomed Pharmacother,207,16

METHODS: IBD medications that were stopped due to COVID-19 were recorded in the SECURE-IBD registry in addition to demographic and clinical data. We conducted descriptive analyses to understand characteristics associated with stopping IBD medications in response to active COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: Of 1,499 patients, IBD medications were stopped in 518 (34.6%) patients. On bivariate and multivariable analyses, a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis or IBD-unspecified was associated with a lower odds of stopping medication compared with Crohn's disease [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.48, 0.75]. When evaluating specific medications, 5-aminosalicylic acid was more likely to be continued (p<0.001) while anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy and immunomodulator therapy were more likely to be stopped (global p <0.001). Other demographic and clinical characteristics did not impact prescription patters.

Blood-based biomarker (BBBM) tests are a promising tool to improve triaging at the primary care level. We projected their impact on cost of and wait times during the diagnostic process. Methods: We compare four scenarios for triaging patients at the primary care level from the perspective of the U.S. health care system: (1) cognitive test only (Mini Mental State Examination [MMSE]), (2) BBBM test only, (3) MMSE followed by BBBM if positive, and (4) BBBM followed by MMSE if positive. Results: Referring patients to dementa specialists based on MMSE or BBBM results alone would continuously require more specialist appointments than projected to be available until 2050. Combining MMSE and BBBM would eliminate wait lists after the first 3 years and reduce average annual cost by $400 to 700 million, while increasing correctly identified cases by about 120,000 per year. Discussion: The combination BBBM with MMSE is projected to increase the efficiency and value of the triage process for DMT eligibility.","Mattke, Soeren; Cho, Sang Kyu; Bittner, Tobias; Hlávka, Jakub; Hanson, Mark",Alzheimers Dement (Amst),207,20

METHODS: Specificity was evaluated in 103 samples collected before January 2020. Sensitivity and time to seropositivity was evaluated in 167 samples from 94 patients with COVID-19 confirmed with RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swab. RESULTS: Specificity (confidence interval) of lateral flow assays (LFAs) was &#8805;91.3% (84.0-95.5) for IgM, &#8805;90.3% (82.9-94.8) for IgG, and &#8805;85.4% (77.2-91.1) for the combination IgM OR IgG. Specificity of the ELISA was 96.1% (90.1-98.8) for IgG and only 73.8% (64.5-81.4) for IgA. Sensitivity 14-25 days after the onset of symptoms was between &#8805;92.1% (78.5-98.0) and 100% (95.7-100) for IgG LFA compared to 89.5% (75.3-96.4) for IgG ELISA. Positivity of IgM OR IgG for LFA resulted in a decrease in specificity compared to IgG alone without a gain in diagnostic performance, except for VivaDiag. The results for IgM varied significantly between the LFAs with an average overall agreement of only 70% compared to 89% for IgG. The average dynamic trend to seropositivity for IgM was not shorter than for IgG. At the time of hospital admission the sensitivity of LFA was <60%. CONCLUSIONS: Sensitivity for the detection of IgG antibodies 14-25 days after the onset of symptoms was &#8805;92.1% for all seven LFAs compared to 89.5% for the IgG ELISA.

However, many data sets that could inform science and policy during an emerging event do not exist or are only released months or years later. Here, we synthesize multiple data sources from across the seafood supply chain, including unconventional real-time data sets, to show the relative initial responses and indicators of recovery during the COVID-19 pandemic. We synthesized news articles from January to September 2020 that reported effects of COVID-19 on the US seafood sector, including processor closures, shortened fishing seasons and loss of revenue. Concerning production and distribution, we assessed past and present landings and trade data and found substantial declines in fresh seafood catches (-40%), imports (-37%) and exports (-43%) relative to the previous year, while frozen seafood products were generally less affected. Google search trends and seafood market foot traffic data suggest consumer demand for seafood from restaurants dropped by upwards of 70% during lockdowns, with recovery varying by state. However, these declines were partially offset by an increase (270%) in delivery and takeout service searches. Our synthesis of open-access data sets and media reports shows widespread, but heterogeneous, ramifications of COVID-19 across the seafood sector, implying that policymakers should focus support on states and sub-sectors most affected by the pandemic: fishery-dependent communities, processors, and fisheries and aquaculture that focus on fresh products.","White, Easton R; Froehlich, Halley E; Gephart, Jessica A; Cottrell, Richard S; Branch, Trevor A; Agrawal Bejarano, Rahul; Baum, Julia K",,207,1

However, current systems rely significantly on the high local oxygen levels and strongly acidic conditions (pH = 3.0-5.0). Simultaneously, the produced ROS can be rapidly consumed by intracellular glutathione (GSH) in the electron transport chain. Herein, an original and biomimetic CoO@AuPt nanocatalyst was prepared based on the assembly of Au and Pt nanoparticles (NPs) on the surface of hollow CoO nanocapsules. The as-synthesized nanozyme exhibits extremely high stability under physiological conditions, whereas it undergoes spontaneous disintegration in the unique tumor microenvironment (TME). Subsequently, the decomposition products can catalyze a cascade of biochemical reactions to produce abundant ROS without any external stimuli. Thus, the present nanoplatform can increase intracellular ROS levels through continuous supply of H2O2, relief of local hypoxia and depletion of GSH, which result in remarkable and specific tumor damage both in vitro and in vivo. The findings of this study highlight the promising potential of CoO@AuPt nanocatalyst as a TME-responsive CDT nanomagnet for highly efficient tumor therapy.","Fu, Shiyan; Yang, Ruihao; Zhang, Lei; Liu, Weiwei; Du, Guangyuan; Cao, Yang; Xu, Zhigang; Cui, Hongjuan; Kang, Yuejun; Xue, Peng",Biomaterials,207,24

In this context, we decided to rapidly design and implement a psychological support system for all hospital workers in Paris during the Covid-19 outbreak. Methods: We built a hotline in 3 days using the following steps: 1) official mandate, 2) request for the creation of hotline numbers, 3) formulation of psychological intervention materials and policies, 4) call for volunteer certified psychologists, 5) call for volunteer certified psychiatrists in case of psychiatric cases, 6) creation of an anonymous and protected database, and 7) communication and regular reminders about the existence of the hotline for hospital workers. Results: After the first 26 days, we received 149 calls with a mean of 5.73 calls/day (SD=3.22). The average call duration was 18.5 min (min=1; max=65min; SD=14.7), and mostly women (86%) called. The mean age was 32.7 years old (SD=11.0). Calls from hospital workers were from all professions; though mostly represented by frontline healthcare workers, non-frontline departments also called (total of 44 departments). Reasons for calling were anxiety symptoms (n=73, 49%), request for hotline information (n=31, 20.8%), worries about Covid-19 (n=23, 15.44%), exhaustion (n=17, 11.41%), trauma reactivation (n=10, 6.11%), insomnia (n=9, 6.0%), anger (n=8, 5.37%), depressive (n=6, 4.02%), and psychotic symptoms (n=3, 2.01%). Regarding referrals, 105 (70.47%) of them were referred to psychosocial, Covid, and general support. Conclusions: This psychological support system can be easily duplicated and seems to benefit all hospital professions that all appeared psychologically affected.","Geoffroy, Pierre A.; Le Goanvic, Véronique; Sabbagh, Olivier; Richoux, Charlotte; Weinstein, Aviv; Dufayet, Geoffrey; Lejoyeux, Michel",Front.

The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been proven to be used by SARS-CoV-2 for host cell entry. Considering that angiotensin receptor blockers and ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) upregulate the expression of ACE2 in animal studies, there may be a concern about whether these drugs may increase COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. Recently, there has been a debate among clinicians about whether to continue or to stop ACEIs and angiotensin receptor blockers in the context of COVID-19. Also, some media outlets and health systems have called for the discontinuation of these drugs in the context of suspected COVID-19. This has necessitated an urgent release of guidance on the use of such medications in COVID-19 patients. To date, multiple theories relating to the pure effects of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors on COVID-19 infections have been postulated. Favorable effects include blocking the ACE2 receptors, preventing viral entry into the heart and lungs, and protecting against lung injury in COVID-19. Adverse effects include a possible retrograde feedback mechanism that upregulates ACE2 receptors. This review provides greater insight into the role of the RAAS axis in acute lung injury and the effects of RAAS inhibitors on SARS-CoVs. The hypothesis that RAAS inhibitors facilitate viral insertion and the alternative hypothesis of the beneficial role of these drugs are discussed. Up-to-date published data concerning the RAAS inhibitors and COVID-19 are summarized.","Albashir, Ahmed Abdalazim Dafallah",South Med J,207,19

The purpose of the studyAssessment of significance of online queries regarding smell impairment to evaluate the epidemiological status and effectiveness of COVID-19 epidemic control measures. Materials and methodsWeekly online queries from Yandex Russian users regarding smell impairment were analysed in regions and large cities of Russia from 16/3/2020 to 21/2/2021. A total of 81 regions of Russia and several large cities, such as Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Nizhny Novgorod, were included in the study. ResultsA strong positive direct correlation (r>0.7) was found between the number of smell-related queries in Yandex new cases of COVID-19 in 59 out of 85 Russian regions and large cities (70%). During the ""first"" peak of COVID-19 incidence in Russia (April-May 2020), the increase in the number of smell-related queries outpaced the increase in the number of new cases by 1-2 weeks in 23 out of 59 regions of Russia. During the ""second"" peak of COVID-19 incidence in Russia (October-December 2020), the increase in the number of smell-related queries outpaced the increase in the number of new cases by 1-2 weeks in 36 regions of Russia, including Moscow. We also estimated the increase in the query/new case ratio during the ""second"" peak of incidence for 45 regions. It was found that the query/new case ratio increased by more than 100% in 24 regions. The regions where the increase in queries was more than 160% compared to new infection cases during the ""second"" peak of incidence demonstrated significantly higher search activity related to levofloxacin than the regions where the increase in queries was lower than 160% compared to the increase in new infection cases. ConclusionThe sudden interest in smell impairment and growing frequency of online queries among the population can be used as an indicator of the spread of coronavirus infection among the population as well as for evaluation of the effectiveness of COVID-19 epidemic control measures.","Momynaliev, Kuvat; Khoroshun, Dimash; Akimkin, Vasiliy",,207,16

In 2018, we conducted a systematic review to identify priority research questions for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Here, we review information available on COVID-19 and provide an evidenced-based framework for priority clinical research in the current outbreak. Methods: Three bibliographic databases were searched to identify clinical studies published on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in the outbreak setting. Studies were grouped thematically according to clinical research questions addressed. In February 2020, available information on COVID19 was reviewed and compared to the results of the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV systematic review. Results: From the research objectives for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, ten themes in the literature were identified: Clinical characterisation, prognosis, diagnosis, clinical management, viral pathogenesis, epidemiological characterisation, infection prevention and control/transmission, susceptibility, psychosocial, and aetiology. For COVID19, some information on clinical presentation, diagnostic testing, and aetiology is available but many clinical research gaps have yet to be filled. Conclusions: Based on a systematic review of other severe coronaviruses, we summarise the state of clinical research for COVID-19, highlight the research gaps, and provide recommendations for the implementation of standardised protocols.

Findings revealed that belief in 5G COVID-19 conspiracy theories was positively correlated with state anger, which in turn, was associated with a greater justification of real-life and hypothetical violence in response to an alleged link between 5G mobile technology and COVID-19, alongside a greater intent to engage in similar behaviours in the future. Moreover, these associations were strongest for those highest in paranoia. Furthermore, we show that these patterns are not specific to 5G conspiratorial beliefs: General conspiracy mentality was positively associated with justification and willingness for general violence, an effect mediated by heightened state anger, especially for those most paranoid in the case of justification of violence. Such research provides novel evidence on why and when conspiracy beliefs may justify the use of violence.","Jolley, Daniel; Paterson, Jenny L",Br J Soc Psychol,207,16

AIM: Summarize the most relevant data from a literature systematic review on the impact on youths' physical health of the 2020 school closure and social distances measures implemented in response to covid-19 pandemic. METHODS: Authors of the original review searched on 11 international databases up to 1st September 2020 to retrieve cohort studies, cross sectional surveys, uncontrolled pre-post studies and modelling studies. Methodological quality has been assessed with validated checklists. RESULTS: Forty-two studies reporting the impact on physical health have been finally included. They have been conducted in 14 countries, most of which in Italy (30.9%) and UK (30.9%). The majority were cohort studies (40.5%) and the overall methodological quality, irrespective of study designs, was high for the 71.4% of the studies. Twenty-seven studies assessed the impact on health services utilization, whose results showed a relevant reduction of Emergency Departments accesses (64%-89.3%) and hospital admissions (31%-85%); however, an increase of acute cases was observed together with delayed admission. An important reduction of vaccine services utilization was also noted during the first period of lockdown. Domestic accidents and head trauma for suspected domestic violence increased. Health related behaviours worsened, with a relevant increase of screen time (mean of 2.9 hours to 5.1 hours), an important reduction of physical activity (up to 64%). Finally, sleep problems and increase of food consumption, particularly the unhealthy food were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Relevant negative effects of school closure and social distances measures have observed. All the studies have been conducted during the first wave of pandemic and assessed the short-term effect of closures implemented for relatively short periods. If school closure and rigid social distances measures imposition will extend for a long time, an even more pronounced negative effect can be expected. In the context of health policies, in addition to the potential benefits of school closures and social distancing measures on the containment of infection, the potential damage on the physical health of young people should be taken into account by implementing policies to safeguard their health.","Saulle, Rosella; Minozzi, Silvia; Amato, Laura; Davoli, Marina",Recenti Prog Med,207,24

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted problems of sustainable infection prevention and control measures worldwide, particularly the emerging issues with an insufficient supply of personal protective equipment. The aim of this study was to provide an action plan for mitigation of occupational hazards and nosocomial spread of SARS-CoV-2 through a failure mode analysis based on observations during in situ simulations. METHODS: A multicenter, cross-sectional, observational, simulation-based study was performed in Latvia from March 2 to 26, 2020. This study was conducted at 7 hospitals affiliated with Riga Stradins University. The presentation of a COVID-19 patient was simulated with an in situ simulations, followed by a structured debrief. Healthcare Failure Modes and Effects Analysis is a tool for conducting a systematic, proactive analysis of a process in which harm may occur. We used Healthcare Failure Modes and Effects Analysis to analyze performance gaps and systemic issues. RESULTS: A total of 67 healthcare workers from 7 hospitals participated in the study (range = 4-17). A total of 32 observed failure modes were rated using a risk matrix. Twenty-seven failure modes (84.4%) were classified as either medium or high risk or were single-point weaknesses, hence evaluated for action type and action; 11 (40.7%) were related to organizational, 11 (40.7%) to individual, and 5 (18.5%) to environmental factors. CONCLUSIONS: Simulation-based failure mode analysis helped us identify the risks related to the preparedness of the healthcare workers and emergency departments for the COVID-19 pandemic in Latvia. We believe that this approach can be implemented to assess and maintain readiness for the outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases in the future.","Balmaks, Reinis; Gramatniece, Alise; Vilde, Aija; Lulla, Martins; Dumpis, Uga; Gross, Isabel Theresia; Slezina, Ieva",Simul. healthc,207,16

We hypothesized that continuous telemetry- based QT monitoring is associated with better detection of prolonged QT episodes. Methods: We introduced Continuous Cardiac Telemetry (CCT) with an algorithm for automated QT interval monitoring to our designated COVID-19 units. The daily maximum automated heart-rate corrected QT (Auto-QTc) measurements were recorded. We compared the proportion of marked QTc prolongation episodes (Long-QTc), defined as QTc > 500 ms, in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted before and after CCT was implemented (control group vs CCT group, respectively). Manual QTc measurement by electrophysiologists (EP-QTc) was used to verify Auto-QTc. Charts were reviewed to describe the clinical response to Long-QTc episodes. Results: We included 33 consecutive patients (total of 451 monitoring days). Long-QTc episodes were detected more frequently in the CCT group [69/206 (34%) vs 26/245 (11%), P < 0.0001] and ECGs were performed less frequently [32/206 (16%) vs 78/245 (32%), P < 0.0001]. Auto-QTc correlated well with EP-QTc with an excellent agreement in detecting Long-QTc (Kappa=0.8, P<0.008). Only 28% of Long-QTc episodes were treated with recommended therapies. There was one episode of Torsade de Pointes (TdP) in the control group and none in the CCT group. Conclusion: Continuous QT interval monitoring is superior to standard of care in detecting episodes of Long-QTc with minimal need for ECGs. The clinical response to Long-QTc episodes is suboptimal.","Alqarawi, Wael; Birnie, David H; Golian, Mehrdad; Nair, Girish M; Nery, Pablo B; Klein, Andres; Davis, Darryl R; Sadek, Mouhannad M; Neilipovitz, David; Johnson, Christopher B; Green, Martin S; Redpath, Calum",,207,30

Our objective was to determine the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on decision making and the resulting outcomes for patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent intracranial tumors. METHODS: We performed a multicenter prospective study of all adult patients discussed in weekly neuro-oncology and skull base multidisciplinary team meetings who had a newly diagnosed or recurrent intracranial (excluding pituitary) tumor between 01 April and 31 May 2020. All patients had at least 30-day follow-up data. Descriptive statistical reporting was used. RESULTS: There were 1357 referrals for newly diagnosed or recurrent intracranial tumors across 15 neuro-oncology centers. Of centers with all intracranial tumors, a change in initial management was reported in 8.6% of cases (n = 104/1210). Decisions to change the management plan reduced over time from a peak of 19% referrals at the start of the study to 0% by the end of the study period. Changes in management were reported in 16% (n = 75/466) of cases previously recommended for surgery and 28% of cases previously recommended for chemotherapy (n = 20/72). The reported SARS-CoV-2 infection rate was similar in surgical and non-surgical patients (2.6% vs. 2.4%, P &gt; .9). CONCLUSIONS: Disruption to neuro-oncology services in the UK caused by the COVID-19 pandemic was most marked in the first month, affecting all diagnoses. Patients considered for chemotherapy were most affected. In those recommended surgical treatment this was successfully completed. Longer-term outcome data will evaluate oncological treatments received by these patients and overall survival.","Fountain, D. M.; Piper, R. J.; Poon, M. T. C.; Solomou, G.; Brennan, P.

Understanding the root cause of the instability of these vaccines may help to rationally improve mRNA-LNP product stability and thereby ease the temperature conditions for storage. In this review we discuss proposed structures of mRNA-LNPs, factors that impact mRNA-LNP stability and strategies to optimize mRNA-LNP product stability. Analysis of mRNA-LNP structures reveals that mRNA, the ionizable cationic lipid and water are present in the LNP core. The neutral helper lipids are mainly positioned in the outer, encapsulating, wall. mRNA hydrolysis is the determining factor for mRNA-LNP instability. It is currently unclear how water in the LNP core interacts with the mRNA and to what extent the degradation prone sites of mRNA are protected through a coat of ionizable cationic lipids. To improve the stability of mRNA-LNP vaccines, optimization of the mRNA nucleotide composition should be prioritized. Secondly, a better understanding of the milieu the mRNA is exposed to in the core of LNPs may help to rationalize adjustments to the LNP structure to preserve mRNA integrity. Moreover, drying techniques, such as lyophilization, are promising options still to be explored.","Schoenmaker, Linde; Witzigmann, Dominik; Kulkarni, Jayesh A; Verbeke, Rein; Kersten, Gideon; Jiskoot, Wim; Crommelin, Daan J A",Int J Pharm,207,23

METHODS: In 2020, the team developed a computational model that represents the U.S. population, COVID-19 coronavirus spread, and vaccines with different possible efficacies (to prevent infection or to reduce severe disease) and vaccination timings to estimate the clinical and economic value of vaccination. RESULTS: Except for a limited number of situations, mainly early on in a pandemic and for a vaccine that prevents infection, when an initial vaccine is available, waiting for a vaccine with a higher efficacy results in additional hospitalizations and costs over the course of the pandemic. For example, if a vaccine with a 50% efficacy in preventing infection becomes available when 10% of the population has already been infected, waiting until 40% of the population are infected for a vaccine with 80% efficacy in preventing infection results in 15.6 million additional cases and 1.5 million additional hospitalizations, costing $20.6 billion more in direct medical costs and $12.4 billion more in productivity losses. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that there are relatively few situations in which it is worth foregoing the first COVID-19 vaccine available in favor of a vaccine that becomes available later on in the pandemic even if the latter vaccine has a substantially higher efficacy.","Bartsch, Sarah M; O039,; Shea, Kelly J; Wedlock, Patrick T; Strych, Ulrich; Ferguson, Marie C; Bottazzi, Maria Elena; Randall, Samuel L; Siegmund, Sheryl S; Cox, Sarah N; Hotez, Peter J; Lee, Bruce Y",Am. j. prev. med,207,22

407295,407295,407295,A versatile web app for identifying the drivers of COVID-19 epidemics,15.350675,5.537909,2021,"OBJECTIVE: The ""Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)"" disease has caused a worldwide challenging and threatening pandemic (COVID-19), with huge health and economic losses. The US Food and Drug Administration, (FDA) has granted emergency use authorization for treatment with the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. Many people have a history of a significant allergic reaction to a specific food, medicine, or vaccine; hence, people all over the world have great concerns about these two authorized vaccines. This article compares the pharmacology, indications, contraindications, and adverse effects of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The required documents and information were collected from the relevant databases, including Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics), PubMed, EMBASE, World Health Organization (WHO), Food and Drug Authorities (FDA) USA, Local Ministries, Health Institutes, and Google Scholar. The key terms used were: Coronavirus, SARS-COV-2, COVID-19 pandemic, vaccines, Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, Moderna vaccine, pharmacology, benefits, allergic responses, indications, contraindications, and adverse effects. The descriptive information was recorded, and we eventually included 12 documents including research articles, clinical trials, and websites to record the required information. RESULTS: Based on the currently available literature, both vaccines are beneficial to provide immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pfizer/BioNTech Vaccine has been recommended to people 16 years of age and older, with a dose of 30 µg (0.3 m) at a cost of $19.50. It provides immunogenicity for at least 119 days after the first vaccination and is 95% effective in preventing the SARS-COV-2 infection. However, Moderna Vaccine has been recommended to people 18 years of age and older, with a dose of 50 µg (0.5 mL) at a cost of $32-37. It provides immunogenicity for at least 119 days after the first vaccination and is 94.5% effective in preventing the SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, some associated allergic symptoms have been reported for both vaccines. The COVID-19 vaccines can cause mild adverse effects after the first or second doses, including pain, redness or swelling at the site of vaccine shot, fever, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting, itching, chills, and joint pain, and can also rarely cause anaphylactic shock. The occurrence of adverse effects is reported to be lower in the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine compared to the Moderna vaccine; however, the Moderna vaccine compared to the Pfizer vaccine is easier to transport and store because it is less temperature sensitive. CONCLUSIONS: The FDA has granted emergency use authorization for the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. These vaccines can protect recipients from a SARS-CoV- 2 infection by formation of antibodies and provide immunity against a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Both vaccines can cause various adverse effects, but these reactions are reported to be less frequent in the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine compared to the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine; however, the Moderna vaccine compared to the Pfizer vaccine is easier to transport and store because it is less temperature sensitive.","Meo, S A; Bukhari, I A; Akram, J; Meo, A S; Klonoff, D C",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,207,24

Due to the shortage of these devices, they should be prioritised for use in healthcare settings when aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) are performed. Several different procedures have been tested for decontamination of respirators in the event of shortage. The most useful methods are highlighted in the overview table in the conclusions. Guiding principles for reuse are: Respirators which have been visibly contaminated (e.g. during procedure at intubated patients, such as suction cleaning of airways, taking probes, extubation attempts, etc.) or are damaged or not fitting, should be discarded and cannot be taken for re-use or decontamination procedures;Respirators may be protected by a medical face mask in order to prevent soiling;Use of new 'expired respirators' (manufacturers expiry date) is possible if they were properly stored until use. A quite feasible approach for reuse of respirators seems to be providing each healthcare worker with a set of minimum five respirators (potential SARS-CoV-2 contamination of the four respirators not in use will be inactivated after five days). Irrespective of which method of decontamination is applied, a fit-check prior to re-use is necessary. If the fit check is not passed, the respirator should be discarded.

Severe asthma is more susceptible to virus-induced asthma exacerbations, especially in the presence of high IgE levels. In the course of immune responses to viruses, an initial activation of innate immunity typically occurs and the production of type I and III interferons is essential in the control of viral spread. However, the Th2 inflammatory environment still appears to be protective against viral infections in general and in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections as well. As for now, literature data, although extremely limited and preliminary, show that severe asthma patients treated with biologics don't have an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or progression to severe forms compared to the non-asthmatic population. Omalizumab, an anti-IgE monoclonal antibody, exerts a profound cellular effect, which can stabilize the effector cells, and is becoming much more efficient from the point of view of innate immunity in contrasting respiratory viral infections. In addition to the antiviral effect, clinical efficacy and safety of this biological allow a great improvement in the management of asthma.","Menzella, Francesco; Ghidoni, Giulia; Galeone, Carla; Capobelli, Silvia; Scelfo, Chiara; Facciolongo, Nicola Cosimo",,207,16

However, it is unclear whether such a trend in treatment complexity can accelerate treatment centralization. The aim of this study was to reveal the current trend in the treatment of GBM in Japan. METHODS: We used diagnostic procedure combination (DPC) database to analyze the data of 1,774 patients from 305 institutions between April 2016 and March 2019. To analyze the situations associated with first-line BEV use during concurrent TMZ (temozolomide)-radiotherapy, we compared TMZ alone and TMZ-BEV groups. RESULTS: Of the 1,774 patients with GBM, tumor removal by craniotomy was performed in 1,572 (88.6%) patients, and stereotactic biopsy was performed in 156 (8.8%) patients. A total of 1,229 (69.3%) patients underwent radiotherapy, and 1,287 (72.5%) patients underwent chemotherapy. TMZ alone was administered to 878 (68.2%) and TMZ combined with BEV in 381 (29.6%) patients. In the TMZ-BEV group, as compared to the TMZ-alone group, the rate of discharge to home was significantly lower (P = 0.0044), and the rate of stereotactic biopsy was significantly higher (P < 0.0001). No significant difference was observed in the distribution of patients between the TMZ alone and TMZ-BEV groups depending on the scale of institution (P = 0.1240). CONCLUSION: First-line BEV administration seems to be selected properly regardless of the institutional scale.

Children have not suffered as much from the direct effects of COVID-19 infection as older adults. Still, there is mounting evidence that their health and welfare are being adversely affected. Closure of schools has been a critical component of social isolation but has a far broader impact than the diminution of educational opportunities, as important as these are. Reopening of schools is therefore essential to recovery, with some countries already tentatively implementing it. Children's interests are vital considerations in any recovery plan, but the question remains as to how to address them within the context of how society views children; should they be regarded as pawns, pathfinders or partners in this enterprise?","Larcher, Victor; Brierley, Joe",J. med. ethics,207,1

These measures overcome the challenges incurred by patients’ signature on paper-based records and medical records archiving during the epidemic. On the other hand, they can not only downsize the paper-based medical records, minimize the risk of infection caused by paper-based medical records via contacts, but also effectively save the hospital of its operating costs and improve its efficiency of clinical work.","NAI, Cunjian; REN, Yufei; ZHANG, Xiaoxiang; Yi, HE; PEI, Yi; MOU, Lan",Chinese Journal of Hospital Administration,207,16

The experiment primes decision-makers on the pandemic's negative financial and economic prospects vis-à-vis its impact on health and well-being. When negative economic prospects are emphasized, the study finds decreased preferences for a directive state and increased preferences for a coping state. The study concludes that how decision-makers interpret the nature of a crisis determines their preferred response: An emphasis on the negative economic prospects of the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to increase preferences for renewed policies of austerity.","van der Voet, Joris",Public adm,207,29

Common practice includes administering neuromuscular blockade [paralytic medication] when proning this population, despite equivocal data regarding benefits of routine paralysis in ARDS. During the COVID19 pandemic, drug shortages and other factors have driven clinicians to prone patients without therapeutic paralysis. Recent publications also suggest prone positioning may be beneficial for non-intubated (non-paralyzed patients). We hypothesized that intubated patients with COVID19-related ARDS can be safely proned without therapeutic paralysis and would experience similar improvement in gas exchange (as evidenced by improved PF [Pa02/Fi02] and SF [Sp02/Fi02] ratios). Methods: Observational data on ICU patients were collected at a large tertiary university hospital from March to September 2020. Clinical teams directed use of sedatives, paralytics, mechanical ventilation settings, and timing of prone vs. supine positioning and blood draws. Comparison of demographics, gas exchange in supine and prone positions (within the same subjects), as well as oxygen requirements, ventilator settings, adverse events and hemodynamic parameters were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: Among our cohort of 156 patients, a total of 15 patients were identified that changed from supine to prone position with and without the use of paralytics while in the ICU. All 15 patients had moderate to severe ARDS per the Berlin Criteria, secondary to COVID19. PF and SF ratios were compared in the same patient before and after proning with and without paralytics (within subject comparisons). All groups had an improvement in both average PF ratio (34.7% with and 24.0% without paralysis, p=0.52) and average SF ratio (5.2% with and 6.1% without paralysis, p=0.92) after proning (Figure 1). There were no serious adverse events associated with prone positioning with or without paralytics. Conclusions: When proning patients with COVID19 ARDS, we found no statistically significant difference to support routine use of paralytics when proning. Safety and efficacy were similar when COVID19 patients were being proned with or without neuromuscular blockade. Use of paralytic medication should be an individualized decision rather than given routinely. Larger randomized controlled trials comparing proning with or without paralysis are needed to identify the optimal approach in this population.","Cotton, S.; Husain, A.

DATA SOURCES: Eligible studies published until May 28, 2020, were retrieved from PubMed, EMBASE, medRxiv, and bioRxiv collection databases. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: This systematic review included cohort studies, case series, and case reports of pregnant women who received a coronavirus disease 2019 diagnosis using severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 viral RNA test and had reported data regarding the testing of neonates or fetuses for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 immediately after birth and within 48 hours of birth. A total of 30 eligible case reports describing 43 tested neonates and 38 cohort or case series studies describing 936 tested neonates were included. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: The methodological quality of all included studies was evaluated by a modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Quantitative synthesis was performed on cohort or case series studies according to the neonatal biological specimen site to reach pooled proportions of vertical transmission. RESULTS: Our quantitative synthesis revealed that of 936 neonates from mothers with coronavirus disease 2019, 27 neonates had a positive result for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 viral RNA test using nasopharyngeal swab, indicating a pooled proportion of 3.2% (95% confidence interval, 2.2-4.3) for vertical transmission. Of note, the pooled proportion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positivity in neonates by nasopharyngeal swab in studies from China was 2.0% (8/397), which was similar to the pooled proportion of 2.7% (14/517) in studies from outside of China. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 viral RNA testing in neonatal cord blood was positive in 2.9% of samples (1/34), 7.7% of placenta samples (2/26), 0% of amniotic fluid (0/51), 0% of urine samples (0/17), and 9.7% of fecal or rectal swabs (3/31). Neonatal serology was positive in 3 of 82 samples (3.7%) (based on the presence of immunoglobulin M). CONCLUSION: Vertical transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is possible and seems to occur in a minority of cases of maternal coronavirus disease 2019 infection in the third trimester. The rates of infection are similar to those of other pathogens that cause congenital infections. However, given the paucity of early trimester data, no assessment can yet be made regarding the rates of vertical transmission in early pregnancy and potential risk for consequent fetal morbidity and mortality.","Kotlyar, Alexander M; Grechukhina, Olga; Chen, Alice; Popkhadze, Shota; Grimshaw, Alyssa; Tal, Oded; Taylor, Hugh S; Tal, Reshef",Am. j. obstet. gynecol,207,15

In this study, analysis of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of adult worms and larval stages of T. hydatigena isolated from dogs, sheep and a wild boar in China showed that the population structure consists of two major haplogroups with very high nucleotide substitutions involving synonymous and non-synonymous changes. Compared with other cestodes such as Echinococcus spp., the genetic variation observed between the haplogroups is sufficient for the assignment of major haplotype or genotype division as both groups showed a total of 166 point-mutation differences between the 12 mitochondrial protein-coding gene sequences.

We aimed to (1) differentiate the burden caused by the pandemic versus the tumor and (2) establish topics relevant for brain tumor patients (BTPs) and caregivers. METHODS: Patients and caregivers were prospectively assessed from April 2020-July 2020 by a 10-item comprising interview over the phone, including qualitative and quantitative questions. They were quantitatively evaluated i.a. by the distress thermometer (DT, score 1-10). The qualitative questions were analyzed using structured content analysis: The interview questions defined the main categories. Subcategories were derived by an inductive approach assessing the frequency of patients' and caregivers' answers. RESULTS: A total of 69 patients and 20 caregivers were interviewed; n = 36 were female (49%), mean age was 53 years (range 32-81). Patients' disease-related DT scores were higher than the COVID-19-related DT scores: the median of the disease-related DT score was 7 (range 2-10) versus median of COVID-19-related distress: 5.0 (range 2-7). Caregivers perceived a higher burden due to the disease (DT median disease: 8; range 2-10 vs. DT pandemic: 3, range 0-10). A total of five main and 21 subcategories were elaborated, most frequently mentioned were ""restrictions in public and private affairs"" (28%), ""changes in the psychological well-being"" (23%), ""limited social interaction by contact restriction"" (25%). Subcategories relevant for caregivers were similar to those of BTPs. CONCLUSION: A considerable proportion of patients and caregivers still perceived the brain tumor disease as more burdensome than the pandemic. We established main and subcategories of interview items possibly of great relevance to patients during these difficult times, which could be implemented in the content-related adaption of the psychosocial assessment.","Binswanger, Julia; Kohl, Carolin; Behling, Felix; Noell, Susan; Hirsch, Sophie; Hickmann, Anne-Katrin; Tatagiba, Marcos Soares; Tabatabai, Ghazaleh; Hippler, Melina; Renovanz, Mirjam",Psycho-oncol.

Finally, we want it to highlight a non-exhaustive, yet representative set of showcase examples about how to use IQA to shed light in different chemical problems. To accomplish this, we start by providing a brief context to justify the development of IQA as a real space alternative to other existent energy partition schemes of the non-relativistic energy of molecules. We then introduce a self-contained algebraic derivation of the methodological IQA ecosystem as well as an overview of how these formulations vary with the level of theory employed to obtain the molecular wavefunction upon which the IQA procedure relies. Finally, we review the several applications of IQA as examined by different research groups worldwide to investigate a wide variety of chemical problems.","Guevara-Vela, José Manuel; Francisco, Evelio; Rocha-Rinza, Tomás; Martín Pendás, Ángel",Molecules (Basel),207,22

Methods: In this single center, retrospective case-control study, we included all COVID-19 inpatients transferred or admitted to Wuhan Tongji Hospital from January 3 to March 30 2020 who had definite clinical outcomes (cured or deceased) with complete laboratory and radiological results. Clinical data were extracted from the electronic medical records, and compared between the cured and deceased patients. ROC curves were used to evaluate the prognostic value of the clinical parameters, and multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the risk factors for mortality. The correlation between the variables was evaluated by Spearman correlation analysis. Results: 208 patients were included in this study, 182 patients were cured and discharged, 26 patients died from COVID-2019. Most patients had comorbidities, with hypertension as the most common chronic disease (80; 38%). The most common symptoms at onset were fever (149; 72%), cough (137; 66%), and dyspnea (113; 54%). Elevated leucocytes, neutrophils, inflammatory biomarkers (CRP, ferritin, IL6, IL8, procalcitonin), PT, D-dimer, myocardial enzymes, BUN, decreased lymphocyte and subsets (T cells, CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, NK cells, T cells + B cells + NK cells), and immunological factors (C3, C4) indicated poor outcome. PT, C3, and T cells were confirmed as independent prognostic factors for mortality by logistic regression models. IL6 and CPR were positively correlated with neutrophils, but negatively with lymphocytes and lymphocyte subsets except B cells. IL8 and ferritin were negatively related to T cells and CD4 T cells. Positive associations existed between C3 and T cells, CD4 T cells, and CD8 T cells, whereas there was no significant correlation between C4 and lymphocyte subsets. PT was found positively correlated with IL6, IL8, and CRP. Reverse correlations were explored between C3, C4, and PT, CK-MB, total bilirubin. Conclusions: T cells, C3, and PT were identified as independent prognostic factors for mortality. Decreased C3 and C4, dysregulation of lymphocyte subsets and cytokines may lead to death after SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Zhang, Jing; Wang, Zhihua; Wang, Xiong; Hu, Zhiquan; Yang, Chunguang; Lei, Ping",Front Immunol,207,1

This study aimed to assess the expression of NKG2A inhibitory receptor on natural killer (NK) cells and CD8+ T lymphocytes in COVID-19 patients and correlate the results with disease severity defined according to the criteria established by the world health organization, in a trial to understand the immunological response towards COVID-19 infection. The study enrolled 30 COVID-19 patients classified into 2 groups that comprised 15 subjects each;moderate and severe based on clinical, radiological, and laboratory findings. Ten age and sex matched apparently healthy individuals were included in this study as a control group. About 1 ml EDTA anti-coagulated blood samples were collected for measuring expression of NKG2A/CD159a on CD56+ CD3- NK and CD3+CD8+ T cells by flow cytometry. Results revealed that COVID-19 patients had significantly lower NK and CD8+ T cell counts compared to healthy subjects. Severe cases had significantly lower CD8+ T counts compared to moderate ones. Percentages of NK and CD8+T cells expressing NKG2A receptor were significantly higher in cases compared to controls. Comparison between severe and moderate cases revealed that although the percentages of NK cells expressing NKG2A receptor were not significantly higher in severe cases, the mean fluorescence intensity was significantly higher. The percentages of CD8 +T cells expressing NKG2A receptor were significantly higher in severe cases with higher mean fluorescence intensity. In conclusion, our results indicate that elevated NKG2A expression on cytotoxic lymphocytes correlates with disease severity in COVID-19 patients, and may serve as a potential marker for prognosis. Additionally, the blockade of NKG2A should be investigated as means of enhancing NK cell and cytotoxic T cells antiviral immunity in patients with severe COVID-19 infection.","Yasin, M.

The sweeping whole-of-society measures introduced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may represent a unique opportunity to examine the impact of large-scale changes in work practices on sleep timing. As such, we examined the impact of the travel restrictions and work from home orders imposed in Ireland in March 2020 on sleep timing and quality. METHODS: We utilized a cross-sectional survey deployed shortly after the imposition of restrictions which assessed current and retrospective ratings of sleep timing and quality; the final response set analysed was from 797 adults. Participants completed the ultra-short Munich Chronotype Questionnaire, the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index, and answered questions pertaining to work status such as working from home during the period of restrictions. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: There was a significant shift to later sleep start and end times, as well as delayed time of midsleep on both work and free days, during the period of restrictions. Sleep duration was longer for work days, while free day sleep duration was shorter and there was a reduction in social jetlag during the restrictions. Those who worked from home during restrictions had longer sleep duration on work day and had a significantly larger difference in sleep end on work day than ""essential"" workers who continued to attend their normal place of work.","Raman, Sudha; Coogan, Andrew N",Sleep medicine,207,16

Animal experiments have shown that a variety of animals can become infected with the virus. While coronaviruses have been known to infect animals for decades, the true intermediate host of the virus has not been identified, with no cases of SARS-CoV-2 in wild animals. The screening of wild, farmed, and domesticated animals is necessary to help us understand the virus and its origins and prevent future outbreaks of both COVID-19 and other diseases. There is intriguing evidence that farmed mink infections (acquired from humans) have led to infection of other farm workers in turn, with a recent outbreak of a mink variant in humans in Denmark. A thorough examination of the current knowledge and evidence of the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect different animal species is therefore vital to evaluate the threat of animal to human transmission and reverse zoonosis.","Prince, Tessa; Smith, Shirley L; Radford, Alan D; Solomon, Tom; Hughes, Grant L; Patterson, Edward I",Viruses,207,13

Molecular design is particularly important owing to its broad application domains and boundless creativity attributed to progresses in generative models. The recent maturity of molecular generative models has stimulated expectations for practical use among potential users, who are not necessarily familiar with coding or scripting, such as experimental engineers and students in chemical domains. However, most of the existing molecular generative models are Python libraries on GitHub, that are accessible for only IT-savvy users. To fill this gap, we newly developed a graphical user interface (GUI)-based web application of molecular generative models, Molecule Generation Experience, that is open to the general public. This is the first web application of molecular generative models enabling users to work with built-in datasets to carry out molecular design.

Compared with traditional models, this model is characterized by an urban network perspective and emphasizes the important role of intercity population mobility and high-speed transportation networks. The results show that the model could simulate the inter-city spread of COVID-19 at the early stage in China with high precision. Through scenario simulation, the paper quantitatively evaluated the effect of control measures ""city lockdown"" and ""decreasing population mobility"" on containing the spatial spread of the COVID-19 epidemic. According to the simulation, the total number of infectious cases in China would have climbed to 138,824 on February 2020, or 4.46 times the real number, if neither of the measures had been implemented. Overall, the containment effect of the lockdown of cities in Hubei was greater than that of decreasing intercity population mobility, and the effect of city lockdowns was more sensitive to timing relative to decreasing population mobility.","Wei, Ye; Wang, Jiaoe; Song, Wei; Xiu, Chunliang; Ma, Li; Pei, Tao",Cities,207,16

Recent political and pandemic events have shown the vulnerability to supply chains, highlighting the need for localised manufacturing capabilities to better respond flexibly to national demand. In this paper, we have used the spinning mesh disc reactor (SMDR) as a case study to demonstrate the path forward for manufacturing in the post-Covid world. The SMDR uses centrifugal force to allow the spread of thin film across the spinning disc which has a cloth with immobilised catalyst. The modularity of the design combined with the flexibility to perform a range of chemical reactions in a single equipment is an opportunity towards sustainable manufacturing. A global approach to market research allowed us to identify sectors within the chemical industry interested in novel reactor designs. The drivers for implementing change were identified as low capital cost, flexible operation and consistent product quality. Barriers include cost of change (regulatory and capital costs), limited technical awareness, safety concerns and lack of motivation towards change. Finally, applying the key features of a Sustainable Business Model (SBM) to SMDR, we show the strengths and opportunities for SMDR to align with an SBM allowing for a low-cost, sustainable and regenerative system of chemical manufacturing.","Emma Anna Carolina, Emanuelsson Charles Aurelie Shivaprasad Parimala",Sustainability,207,1

Previous research has demonstrated the passage of time becomes distorted for many people during these lockdowns. To date, research has only examined how time was experienced early in initial lockdowns. The current study examined whether distortions to the passage of time were also present later into the global pandemic. An online questionnaire was used to collect passage of time judgments for the day, week and 8 month period since the first UK lockdown. In addition, measures of affect, social satisfaction, task-load, compliance and health status were also recorded. The results show that over 80% of people reported experiencing distortion to the passage of time during the second English lockdown in comparison with normal. Depression, satisfaction with social interaction and shielding status were found to be significant predictors of temporal distortion. A slower passage of time was associated with greater depression, shielding and greater dissatisfaction with social interactions. Feeling like it was longer than 8 months since the UK's first lockdown was associated with greater depression, increased dissatisfaction with social interaction and greater change of life as a result of lockdown. The results suggest that distortions to the passage of time are an enduring feature of lockdown life and that different factors predict temporal experience during different points in lockdown.","Ogden, Ruth",PLoS One,207,14

CDC at the end of April 2020. These data were subjected to analysis of the current status and correlation between indigenous and imported COVID-19 cases. A phylogenetic tree was created to analyze the phylogeny of Taiwanese SARS-CoV-2 isolates. RESULTS: The first case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Taiwan was detected on January 21, 2020. Epidemiological data indicate that by April 30, there were a total of 429 COVID-19 confirmed cases with the death rate of 1.3%. Most cases were identified as imported (79.9%; 343/429), with the majority originating from the United States of America (22.1%) and the United Kingdom (17.6%). Results from phylogenetic tree analyses indicate that the Taiwanese SARS-CoV-2 isolates were clustered with the SARS-CoV-2 isolates from other countries (bootstrap value 98%) and sub-clustered with bat SARS-like coronaviruses (bootstrap value 99%).

Most mutations are deleterious for RBD expression and ACE2 binding, and we identify constrained regions on the RBD's surface that may be desirable targets for vaccines and antibody-based therapeutics. But a substantial number of mutations are well tolerated or even enhance ACE2 binding, including at ACE2 interface residues that vary across SARS-related coronaviruses.

In addition, the foreseeable shortage of supplies and an increasing flow of suspected and real cases of COVID-19 contribute to the pressures and concerns of health professionals. METHOD: The studies were identified in well-known international journals found in two electronic databases: Scopus and Embase. The data were cross-checked with information from the main international newspapers. RESULTS: Work-related stress is a potential cause of concern for health professionals. It has been associated with anxiety including multiple clinical activities, depression in the face of the coexistence of countless deaths, long work shifts with the most diverse unknowns and demands in the treatment with patients with COVID-19. Therefore, it is an important indicator of psychic exhaustion. CONCLUSIONS: As coronavirus cases increase and deaths surge in Italy, new figures show an ""enormous"" level of contagion among the country's medical personnel. At least 2,629 health workers have been infected with coronavirus since the outbreak onset in February, representing 8.3% of total cases. The percentage of infected health workers has almost doubled the number registered in China throughout the epidemic. Intensive care unit physicians are on their stress limit, especially when dealing with older patients and with death prospects.

In the present study, we performed a comprehensive in silico screening for 16,776 potential molecules from recently established drug libraries based on two important pharmacophores (3-amino-4-phenylbutan-2-ol and piperazine). Based on initial assessment, 4042 molecules were obtained suitable as drug candidates, which were following Lipinski's rule. Molecular docking implemented for the analysis of molecular interactions narrowed this number of compounds down to 19. Subsequent to screening filtering criteria and considering the critical parameters viz. docking score and MM-GBSA binding free energy, 1-(4-((2S,3S)-3-amino-2-hydroxy-4-phenylbutyl)piperazin-1-yl)-3-phenylurea (compound 1) was accomplished to score highest in comparison to the remaining 18 shortlisted drug candidates. Notably, compound 1 displayed higher docking score (-8.069 kcal/mol) and MM-GBSA binding free energy (-49.56 kcal/mol) than the control drug, remdesivir triphosphate, the active form of remdesivir as well as adenosine triphosphate. Furthermore, a molecular dynamics simulation was carried out (100 ns), which substantiated the candidacy of compound 1 as better inhibitor. Overall, our systematic in silico study predicts the potential of compound 1 to exhibit a more favourable specific activity than remdesivir triphosphate. Hence, we suggest compound 1 as a novel potential drug candidate, which should be considered for further exploration and validation of its potential against SARS-CoV-2 in wet lab experimental studies.Communicated by Ramasawamy H.

Studies come from various disciplines in the field of the humanities and social sciences. They show in particular that adherence to CT rebounds at every moment of ""crisis"". The health crisis we are experiencing is no exception: COVID-19 pandemic entails an ""infodemic"", according to Tedros Ghebreyesus, General Director of the World Health Organization. Indeed, we are witnessing the production, and international dissemination, of false informations, including conspiracy explanations of the coronavirus and its consequences. This outbreak of CT is an opportunity to examine the psychological and psychopathological issues of this phenomenon in the face of the ""crisis"", whether collective or individual, health or existential. Methodology: We present a review of the important international scientific literature regarding CT related to the health crisis of the COVID-19. Results: Work that addresses CT related to the COVID-19 crisis has resulted in more than fifty publications in recent months. This research is mainly in the fields of social psychology, medical psychology, differential psychology, political science and public health. The rates of adherence to CT related to COVID-19 are of great concern. The literature mentions predisposing factors to the adherence or diffusion of CT on COVID-19: inclination for CT in general, low level of education, low knowledge of the disease, high level of anxiety, acceptance of xenophobic policies, unfavourable attitude towards marginal groups, nationalist stance. Unsurprisingly, there is widespread agreement in the literature that the conspiracy-prone fringe of the population is less likely to comply with government recommendations related to contamination risks, such as handwashing, social distancing, wearing masks, and using diagnostic tests. This crisis thus demonstrates once again that the circulation of false news and adherence to CT is not just a marginal and inconsequential thinking: it concerns a very large part of the population, with a potentially tragic impact in terms of public health. While there is usually no significant difference in adherence to CT according to gender, it would seem that women are less affected by CT related to the COVID than men, regardless of their political affiliation. Finally, studies on the links between adherence to COVID-related CT and stress levels do not seem to reach a consensus. The same uncertainty can be found in work on other types of CT. Conclusion: These results suggest that in order to understand the psychological causes of CT, it may be useful to address the psychodynamic issues underlying adherence to these beliefs. In particular, a psychopathological approach to this phenomenon enables to understand these beliefs as a defensive solution to cope with psychic vulnerability. CT involves overproducing meaning, as delusion does: CT can be considered as the collective, cultural equivalent of a delusional production. Moreover, it is impervious to arguments and evidences, in the same manner as delusion. However, it differs from it by at least two major characteristics: it is shareable and socializing; it gives rise to a consistent attitude.","Poupart, Florent; Bouscail, Manon",Ann. med.-psychol,207,2

This study aimed to identify its effects on sports medicine physicians during the early phase of this pandemic. DESIGN: Survey study. SETTING: Sports medicine providers. PARTICIPANTS: Physician members of the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine were surveyed between March 25 and April 4, 2020. A total of 810 responses were obtained from 2437 physicians who viewed the survey. INTERVENTIONS: The survey consisted of questions examining demographics, prepandemic practice patterns, anxiety and depression screening, and new beliefs and behaviors following government-based medical policy changes resulting from the pandemic. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in clinical volume and treatment practices, Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4). RESULTS: The mean in-person clinic visits reduced to 17.9%, telephone visits to 24.4%, telemedicine (video) visits to 21.8%, and procedural visits to 13.8% of prepandemic practice volume. The mean PHQ-4 scores for physicians were 2.38 ± 2.40. Clinic and procedural volumes were reduced less by male physicians, as well as more experienced physicians, nonphysical medicine and rehabilitation training background, in government or private practice, and in the Southern region of the United States (P < 0.05).

The evidence related to the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 on pregnancy is limited to the second and third trimester of pregnancy, whereas data on the first trimester are scant. Many viral infections can be harmful to the fetus during the first trimester of pregnancy, and whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is one of them is still unknown. OBJECTIVE: With this study, we evaluated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection as a risk factor for early pregnancy loss in the first trimester of pregnancy. Furthermore, coronavirus disease 2019 course in the first trimester was assessed. STUDY DESIGN: Between February 22 and May 21, 2020, we conducted a case-control study at S. Anna Hospital, Turin, among pregnant women in their first trimester, paired for last menstruation. The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 was compared between women with spontaneous abortion (case group, n=100) and those with ongoing pregnancy (control group, n=125). Current or past infection was determined by the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 from nasopharyngeal swab and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M antibodies in a blood sample. Patient demographics, coronavirus disease 2019-related symptoms, and the main risk factors for abortion were collected. RESULTS: Of 225 women, 23 (10.2%) had a positive test result for coronavirus disease 2019. There was no difference in the cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 between the cases (11/100, 11%) and the controls (12/125, 9.6%) (P=.73). Logistic regression analysis confirmed that coronavirus disease 2019 was not an independent predictor of early pregnancy loss (odds ratio, 1.28; confidence interval, 0.53-3.08). Coronavirus disease 2019-related symptoms in the first trimester were fever, anosmia, ageusia, cough, arthralgia, and diarrhea; no cases of pneumonia or hospital admission owing to coronavirus disease 2019-related symptoms were recorded. No difference in the incidence of symptoms was noted between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection during the first trimester of pregnancy does not seem to predispose to early pregnancy loss; its cumulative incidence did not differ between women with spontaneous abortion and women with ongoing pregnancy. Coronavirus disease 2019 appears to have a favorable maternal course at the beginning of pregnancy, consistent with what has been observed during the second and third trimesters.","Cosma, Stefano; Carosso, Andrea R; Cusato, Jessica; Borella, Fulvio; Carosso, Marco; Bovetti, Marialuisa; Filippini, Claudia; D039,; Avolio, Antonio; Ghisetti, Valeria; Di Perri, Giovanni; Benedetto, Chiara",Am. j. obstet. gynecol,207,16

However, they are urgently needed to manage anaesthesia drug supply in times of drug shortages due to the pandemic. METHODS: We surveyed all Swiss anaesthesia institutions in April 2020 to determine their annual anaesthesia activity. Together with a detailed analysis on anaesthetic drug use of a large, representative Swiss anaesthesia index institution, calculations and projections for the annual need of anaesthetics in Switzerland were made. Only those drugs have been analysed that are either being used very frequently or that have been classified critical with regard to their supply by the pharmacy of the index institution or the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health. RESULTS: The response rate to our questionnaire was 98%. Out of the present 188 Swiss anaesthesia institutions, 185 responded. In Switzerland, the annual number of anaesthesias was 1'071'054 (12'445 per 100'000 inhabitants) with a mean anaesthesia time of 2.03 hours. Teaching hospitals (n = 54) performed more than half (n = 572'231) and non-teaching hospitals (n = 103) provided almost half of all anaesthesias (n = 412'531). Thereby, private hospitals conducted a total of 290'690 anaesthesias. Finally, office-based anaesthesia institutions with mainly outpatients (n = 31) administered 86'292 anaesthesias. Regarding type of anaesthesia provided, two thirds were general anaesthesias (42% total intravenous, 17% inhalation, 8% combined), 20% regional and 12% monitored anaesthesia care. Projecting for example the annual need for propofol in anaesthesia, Switzerland requires 48'573 L of propofol 1% which corresponds to 5'644 L propofol 1% per 100'000 inhabitants every year. CONCLUSIONS: To actively manage anaesthesia drug supply in the context of the current pandemic, it is mandatory to have a detailed understanding of the number and types of anaesthesias provided. On this basis, the Swiss annual consumption of anaesthetics could be projected and the replenishment organized.","Hofer, Christoph Karl; Wendel Garcia, Pedro David; Heim, Christof; Ganter, Michael Thomas",PLoS One,207,26

A standardized terminology was recommended recently for common age-related TDP-43 proteinopathy: limbic-predominant, age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE) and the underlying neuropathological changes, LATE-NC. LATE-NC may be co-morbid with Alzheimer's disease neuropathological changes (ADNC). However, there currently are ill-defined diagnostic classification issues among LATE-NC, ADNC, and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP). A practical challenge is that different autopsy cohorts are composed of disparate groups of research volunteers: hospital- and clinic-based cohorts are enriched for FTLD-TDP cases, whereas community-based cohorts have more LATE-NC cases. Neuropathological methods also differ across laboratories. Here, we combined both cases and neuropathologists' diagnoses from two research centres-University of Pennsylvania and University of Kentucky. The study was designed to compare neuropathological findings between FTLD-TDP and pathologically severe LATE-NC. First, cases were selected from the University of Pennsylvania with pathological diagnoses of either FTLD-TDP (n = 33) or severe LATE-NC (mostly stage 3) with co-morbid ADNC (n = 30). Sections from these University of Pennsylvania cases were cut from amygdala, anterior cingulate, superior/mid-temporal, and middle frontal gyrus. These sections were stained for phospho-TDP-43 immunohistochemically and evaluated independently by two University of Kentucky neuropathologists blinded to case data. A simple set of criteria hypothesized to differentiate FTLD-TDP from LATE-NC was generated based on density of TDP-43 immunoreactive neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions in the neocortical regions. Criteria-based sensitivity and specificity of differentiating severe LATE-NC from FTLD-TDP cases with blind evaluation was â¼90%. Another proposed neuropathological feature related to TDP-43 proteinopathy in aged individuals is 'Alpha' versus 'Beta' in amygdala. Alpha and Beta status was diagnosed by neuropathologists from both universities (n = 5 raters). There was poor inter-rater reliability of Alpha/Beta classification (mean &#954; = 0.31). We next tested a separate cohort of cases from University of Kentucky with either FTLD-TDP (n = 8) or with relatively 'pure' severe LATE-NC (lacking intermediate or severe ADNC; n = 14). The simple criteria were applied by neuropathologists blinded to the prior diagnoses at University of Pennsylvania. Again, the criteria for differentiating LATE-NC from FTLD-TDP was effective, with sensitivity and specificity â¼90%. If more representative cases from each cohort (including less severe TDP-43 proteinopathy) had been included, the overall accuracy for identifying LATE-NC was estimated at >98% for both cohorts. Also across both cohorts, cases with FTLD-TDP died younger than those with LATE-NC (P < 0.0001). We conclude that in most cases, severe LATE-NC and FTLD-TDP can be differentiated by applying simple neuropathological criteria.","Robinson, John L; Porta, Sílvia; Garrett, Filip G; Zhang, Panpan; Xie, Sharon X; Suh, EunRan; Van Deerlin, Vivianna M; Abner, Erin L; Jicha, Gregory A; Barber, Justin M; Lee, Virginia M-Y; Lee, Edward B; Trojanowski, John Q; Nelson, Peter T",Brain,207,22

Those of current concern harbor mutations within the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) that may be associated with viral escape to immune responses. In our geographical area a viral variant we named Marseille-4 harbors a S477â¯N substitution in this RBD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We aimed to implement an in-house one-step real-time reverse transcription-PCR (qPCR) assay with a hydrolysis probe that specifically detects the SARS-CoV-2 Marseille-4 variant. RESULTS: All 6 cDNA samples from Marseille-4 variant strains identified in our institute by genome next-generation sequencing (NGS) tested positive using our Marseille-4 specific qPCR, whereas all 32 cDNA samples from other variants tested negative. In addition, 39/42 (93 %) respiratory samples identified by NGS as containing a Marseille-4 variant strain and 0/26 samples identified as containing non-Marseille-4 variant strains were positive. Finally, 2018/3960 (51%) patients SARS-CoV-2-diagnosed in our institute, 10/277 (3.6 %) respiratory samples collected in Algeria, and none of 207 respiratory samples collected in Senegal, Morocco, or Lebanon tested positive using our Marseille-4 specific qPCR. DISCUSSION: Our in-house qPCR system was found reliable to detect specifically the Marseille-4 variant and allowed estimating it is involved in about half of our SARS-CoV-2 diagnoses since December 2020. Such approach allows the real-time surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 variants, which is warranted to monitor and assess their epidemiological and clinical characterics based on comprehensive sets of data.","Bedotto, Marielle; Fournier, Pierre-Edouard; Houhamdi, Linda; Levasseur, Anthony; Delerce, Jeremy; Pinault, Lucile; Padane, Abdou; Chamieh, Amanda; Tissot-Dupont, Hervé; Brouqui, Philippe; Sokhna, Cheikh; Azar, Eid; Saile, Rachid; Mboup, Souleymane; Bitam, Idir; Colson, Philippe; Raoult, Didier",J Clin Virol,207,24

However, in 2020 the threat of extremely contagious SARS CoV-2 or COVID-19 in Indonesia emerged, which has infected more than 100.303 persons by July 28, 2020, and expected to grow exponentially except if very strict measures were implemented. There are similar symptoms and laboratory findings with both dengue fever and COVID-19, paving way to dangerous possibilities such as incorrect or delayed initial treatment. This is especially worrisome in the context of the pandemic, where COVID-19 positive patients must be promptly identified, isolated and contact-traced, and eluded diagnosis might possibly endanger communities and healthcare workers. We present cases of patients who initially presented with symptoms and laboratory findings of dengue fever, including positive NS1 and/or IgM serology results. During the course of illness these patients fail to show characteristic dengue symptoms, and two cases begin to show respiratory symptoms. Upon further investigation with chest X-ray or contact tracing, the patients were indicated for COVID-19 swab test, which yielded positive results. Repeat dengue IgM/IgG returned positive in one case, suggesting dengue coinfection; however in all other cases, the repeat testing returned negative, suggesting that the initial serologies were false positives. These cases highlight the importance of comprehensively studying patients with apparent dengue fever symptoms and serology, and using the appropriate adjuvant test according to the course of the disease, since a serological overlap may exist between the two diseases.","Kembuan, Gabriele Jessica",IDCases,207,10

Pregnant women are more susceptible to severe coronavirus disease 2019 and are at higher risk of preterm birth than uninfected pregnant women. Despite this evidence, the immunologic effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection during pregnancy remain understudied. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection during pregnancy on inflammatory and humoral responses in maternal and fetal samples and compare antibody responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 among pregnant and nonpregnant women. STUDY DESIGN: Immune responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 were analyzed using samples from pregnant (n=33) and nonpregnant (n=17) women who tested either positive (pregnant, 22; nonpregnant, 17) or negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (pregnant, 11) at Johns Hopkins Hospital. We measured proinflammatory and placental cytokine messenger RNAs, neonatal Fc receptor expression, and tetanus antibody transfer in maternal and cord blood samples. In addition, we evaluated antispike immunoglobulin G, antispike receptor-binding domain immunoglobulin G, and neutralizing antibody responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in serum or plasma collected from nonpregnant women, pregnant women, and cord blood. RESULTS: Pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection expressed more interleukin-1 beta, but not interleukin 6, in blood samples collected within 14 days vs >14 days after performing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 test. Pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection also had reduced antispike receptor-binding domain immunoglobulin G titers and were less likely to have detectable neutralizing antibody than nonpregnant women. Although severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection did not disrupt neonatal Fc receptor expression in the placenta, maternal transfer of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 neutralizing antibody was inhibited by infection during pregnancy. CONCLUSION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection during pregnancy was characterized by placental inflammation and reduced antiviral antibody responses, which may impact the efficacy of coronavirus disease 2019 treatment in pregnancy. In addition, the long-term implications of placental inflammation for neonatal health require greater consideration.","Sherer, Morgan L; Lei, Jun; Creisher, Patrick S; Jang, Minyoung; Reddy, Ramya; Voegtline, Kristin; Olson, Sarah; Littlefield, Kirsten; Park, Han-Sol; Ursin, Rebecca L; Ganesan, Abhinaya; Boyer, Theresa; Elsayed, Nada; Brown, Diane M; Walch, Samantha N; Antar, Annukka A R; Manabe, Yukari C; Jones-Beatty, Kimberly; Golden, William Christopher; Satin, Andrew J; Sheffield, Jeanne S; Pekosz, Andrew; Klein, Sabra L; Burd, Irina",Am. j. obstet. gynecol,207,20

However, clinical decision-making and health management policies often are based additionally on cycle threshold (C t) values (i.e., quantitative results) to guide patient care, segregation and discharge management of individuals testing positive. Therefore, an analysis of inter-protocol variability is needed to assess the comparability of the quantitative results. METHODS: C t values reported in a SARS-CoV-2 virus genome detection external quality assessment challenge were analyzed. Three positive and two negative samples were distributed to participating test laboratories. Qualitative results (positive/negative) and quantitative results (C t values) were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 66 laboratories participated, contributing results from 101 distinct test systems and reporting C t values for a total of 92 different protocols. In all three positive samples, the means of the C t values for the E-, N-, S-, RdRp-, and ORF1ab-genes varied by less than two cycles. However, 7.7% of reported results deviated by more than ±4.0 (maximum 18.0) cycles from the respective individual means. These larger deviations appear to be systematic errors. CONCLUSIONS: In an attempt to use PCR diagnostics beyond the identification of infected individuals, laboratories are frequently requested to report C t values along with a qualitative result. This study highlights the limitations of interpreting C t values from the various SARS-CoV genome detection protocols and suggests that standardization is necessary in the reporting of C t values with respect to the target gene.","Buchta, Christoph; Görzer, Irene; Chiba, Peter; Camp, Jeremy V; Holzmann, Heidemarie; Puchhammer-Stöckl, Elisabeth; Mayerhofer, Maximilian; Müller, Mathias M; Aberle, Stephan W",Clin. chem. lab. med,207,1

Since then, the virus has spread rapidly worldwide, with sharp daily increase in the numbers of infected persons and deaths. COVID-19 spreads via airborne transmission, which renders dental treatment a potential source of virus transmission. Dental treatments require the use of handpieces, ultrasonic devices, and/or air-water syringes, which generate considerable amounts of aerosols. Jordan, being one of the affected countries, instituted preventive lockdown measures from 17 March 2020. Emergency dental treatments were only allowed in dental clinics of the Royal Medical Services of Jordan Armed Forces and Ministry of Health and were prohibited in other sectors such as private clinics and universities. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the dental treatments performed in three military hospitals during the 44-day lockdown period in Jordan. The investigation explores the impact of COVID-19 on the number of patients and types of performed dental treatments. METHODS: Data such as number of patients, patients' age and gender, and performed dental treatments were collected retrospectively from the hospital records and were analysed. RESULTS: Our results showed a 90% decrease in patient visits during the lockdown period compared to regular days. Total number of treatments (1689) during lockdown period varied between endodontic (877/1689, 51.9% cases), extraction and other surgical (374/1689, 22.1% cases), restorative (142/1689, 8.4% cases), and orthodontic treatments (4/1689, 0.2% cases) and other procedures (292/1689, 17.3%). The differences in gender and age group among all clinics were statistically significant (P<.001 and P=.02, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant effect on the number of patients seeking dental treatments. It also affected the types of treatments performed. Endodontic treatment accounted for almost 50% patient load during the lockdown compared to approximately 20% during regular days.","Obeidat, Lina; Masarwa, Nader; AlWarawreh, Amjad; El Naji, Waddah",,207,16

A direct consequence of this inflammatory state in the lungs is the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), frequently observed in severe COVID-19 patients. The ""cytokine storm"" is associated with severe forms of COVID-19 and poor prognosis for COVID-19 patients. Sulforaphane (SFN), one of the main components of Brassica oleraceae L. (Brassicaceae or Cruciferae), is known to possess anti-inflammatory effects in tissues from several organs, among which joints, kidneys and lungs. PURPOSE: The objective of the present study was to determine whether SFN is able to inhibit IL-6 and IL-8, two key molecules involved in the COVID-19 ""cytokine storm"". METHODS: The effects of SFN were studied in vitro on bronchial epithelial IB3-1 cells exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S-protein). The anti-inflammatory activity of SFN on IL-6 and IL-8 expression has been evaluated by RT-qPCR and Bio-Plex analysis. RESULTS: In our study SFN inhibits, in cultured IB3-1 bronchial cells, the gene expression of IL-6 and IL-8 induced by the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2. This represents the proof-of-principle that SFN may modulate the release of some key proteins of the COVID-19 ""cytokine storm"". CONCLUSION: The control of the cytokine storm is one of the major issues in the management of COVID-19 patients. Our study suggests that SFN can be employed in protocols useful to control hyperinflammatory state associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Gasparello, Jessica; D039,; Aversa, Elisabetta; Papi, Chiara; Gambari, Laura; Grigolo, Brunella; Borgatti, Monica; Finotti, Alessia; Gambari, Roberto",Phytomedicine,207,16

The identification of ACE2 in as many as 72 tissues suggests that extrapulmonary invasion and damage is likely, which indeed has already been demonstrated by cardiovascular and gastrointestinal symptoms. On the other hand, identifying ACE2 dysregulation in patients with comorbidities may offer insight as to why COVID-19 symptoms are often more severe in these individuals. This may be attributed to a pre-existing proinflammatory state that is further propelled with the cytokine storm induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection or the loss of functional ACE2 expression as a result of viral internalization. Here, we aim to characterize the distribution and role of ACE2 in various organs to highlight the scope of damage that may arise upon SARS-CoV-2 invasion. Furthermore, by examining the disruption of ACE2 in several comorbid diseases, we offer insight into potential causes of increased severity of COVID-19 symptoms in certain individuals. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Cell surface expression of ACE2 determines the tissue susceptibility for coronavirus infectious disease 2019 infection. Comorbid disease conditions altering ACE2 expression could increase the patient's vulnerability for the disease and its complications, either directly, through modulation of viral infection, or indirectly, through alteration of inflammatory status.","Hammoud, Safaa H; Wehbe, Zena; Abdelhady, Samar; Kobeissy, Firas; Eid, Ali H; El-Yazbi, Ahmed F",Mol Pharmacol,207,1

However, since its discovery in 2012, an effective vaccine has not been developed for it. To develop a vaccine against multiple strains of MERS-CoV, we targeted spike glycoprotein (S) using prime-boost vaccination with DNA and insect cell-expressed recombinant proteins for the receptor-binding domain (RBD), S1, S2, S&#916;TM, or S&#916;ER. Our S subunits were generated using an S sequence derived from the MERS-CoV EMC/2012 strain. We examined humoral and cellular immune responses of various combinations with DNA plasmids and recombinant proteins in mice. Mouse sera immunized with S&#916;ER DNA priming/S&#916;TM protein boosting showed cross-neutralization against 15 variants of S-pseudovirions and the wild-type KOR/KNIH/002 strain. In addition, these immunizations provided full protection against the KOR/KNIH/002 strain challenge in human DPP4 knock-in mice. These findings suggest that vaccination with the S subunits derived from one viral strain can provide cross-protection against variant MERS-CoV strains with mutations in S. DNA priming/protein boosting increased gamma interferon production, while protein-alone immunization did not. The RBD subunit alone was insufficient to induce neutralizing antibodies, suggesting the importance of structural conformation. In conclusion, heterologous DNA priming with protein boosting is an effective way to induce both neutralizing antibodies and cell-mediated immune responses for MERS-CoV vaccine development. This study suggests a strategy for selecting a suitable platform for developing vaccines against MERS-CoV or other emerging coronaviruses.IMPORTANCE Coronavirus is an RNA virus with a higher mutation rate than DNA viruses. Therefore, a mutation in S-protein, which mediates viral infection by binding to a human cellular receptor, is expected to cause difficulties in vaccine development. Given that DNA-protein vaccines promote stronger cell-mediated immune responses than protein-only vaccination, we immunized mice with various combinations of DNA priming and protein boosting using the S-subunit sequences of the MERS-CoV EMC/2012 strain. We demonstrated a cross-protective effect against wild-type KOR/KNIH/002, a strain with two mutations in the S amino acids, including one in its RBD. The vaccine also provided cross-neutralization against 15 different S-pseudotyped viruses. These suggested that a vaccine targeting one variant of S can provide cross-protection against multiple viral strains with mutations in S. The regimen of DNA priming/Protein boosting can be applied to the development of other coronavirus vaccines.","Choi, Jung-Ah; Goo, Junghyun; Yang, Eunji; Jung, Dae-Im; Lee, Sena; Rho, Semi; Jeong, Yuji; Park, Young-Shin; Park, Hayan; Moon, Young-Hye; Park, Uni; Seo, Sang-Hwan; Lee, Hyeja; Lee, Jae Myun; Cho, Nam-Hyuk; Song, Manki; Kim, Jae-Ouk",J. virol,207,24

METHODS: The authors invited 355 dental trainees at the University of Washington School of Dentistry to complete an 83-item questionnaire in August and September 2020. The outcome analyzed was intention to leave their programs. There were 4 self-reported predictors: anxiety, burnout, depression, and COVID-19 impact on overall mental health. The authors ran multiple variable logistic regression models to evaluate relationships between each predictor and outcome (&#945; = .05) and reported odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs. RESULTS: The survey response rate was 35.5%. Overall, 12.7% of participants reported any intention to leave. In total, 22.2% and 16.7% of participants endorsed clinically significant anxiety or depression symptomatology, respectively; 28.6% reported 1 or more burnout symptoms; and 69.0% reported that COVID-19 affected their overall mental health. Participants reporting anxiety (OR, 8.87; 95% CI, 1.80 to 43.57; P = .007), depression (OR, 11.18; 95% CI, 1.84 to 67.74; P = .009), or burnout (OR, 8.14; 95% CI, 1.73 to 38.23; P = .008) were significantly more likely to report intention to leave than those not reporting mental health problems.

This task has been previously instantiated as a form of textual entailment, which results in poor accuracy due to the complexity of the policies. In this paper we propose to address policy compliance detection via decomposing it into question answering, where questions check whether the conditions stated in the policy apply to the scenario, and an expression tree combines the answers to obtain the label. Despite the initial upfront annotation cost, we demonstrate that this approach results in better accuracy, especially in the cross-policy setup where the policies during testing are unseen in training. In addition, it allows us to use existing question answering models pre-trained on existing large datasets. Finally, it explicitly identifies the information missing from a scenario in case policy compliance cannot be determined. We conduct our experiments using a recent dataset consisting of government policies, which we augment with expert annotations and find that the cost of annotating question answering decomposition is largely offset by improved inter-annotator agreement and speed.","Saeidi, Marzieh; Yazdani, Majid; Vlachos, Andreas",,207,16

Allelic variants in ABCB1 and ERCC1 might be associated with early occurrence (ie, end of Week 2 treatment) of grade 3/4 neutropenia. Pharmacogenetic analyses were performed to uncover associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in these genes, patient baseline characteristics, and early occurrence of grade 3/4 neutropenia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ABCB1 (rs1045642, rs1128503) and ERCC1 (rs3212986, rs11615) were analyzed in germline DNA from palbociclib-treated patients from PALOMA-2 (n=584) and PALOMA-3 (n=442). SNP, race, and Cycle 1 Day 15 (C1D15) absolute neutrophil count (ANC) data were available for 652 patients. Univariate and multivariable analyses evaluated associations between SNPs, patient baseline characteristics, and early occurrence of grade 3/4 neutropenia. Analyses were stratified by Asian (n=122) and non-Asian (n=530) ethnicity. Median progression-free survival (mPFS) was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The effect of genetic variants on palbociclib pharmacokinetics was analyzed. RESULTS: ABCB1 and ERCC1_rs11615 SNP frequencies differed between Asian and non-Asian patients. Multivariable analysis showed that low baseline ANC was a strong independent risk factor for C1D15 grade 3/4 neutropenia regardless of race (Asians: odds ratio [OR]=6.033, 95% CI=2.615-13.922, P<0.0001; Non-Asians: OR=6.884, 95% CI=4.138-11.451, P<0.0001). ABCB1_rs1128503 (C/C vs T/T: OR=0.57, 95% CI=0.311-1.047, P=0.070) and ERCC1_rs11615 (A/A vs G/G: OR=1.75, 95% CI=0.901-3.397, P=0.098) were potential independent risk factors for C1D15 grade 3/4 neutropenia in non-Asian patients. Palbociclib mPFS was consistent across genetic variants; exposure was not associated with ABCB1 genotype. CONCLUSION: This is the first comprehensive assessment of pharmacogenetic data in relationship to exposure to a CDK4/6 inhibitor. Pharmacogenetic testing may inform about potentially increased likelihood of patients developing severe neutropenia (NCT01740427, NCT01942135). IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Palbociclib plus endocrine therapy improves HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer (ABC) outcomes, but is commonly associated with neutropenia. Genetic variants in ABCB1 may influence palbociclib exposure, and in ERCC1 are associated with chemotherapy-induced severe neutropenia. Here, the associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms in these genes and baseline characteristics with neutropenia were assessed. Low baseline absolute neutrophil count was a strong risk factor (P<0.0001) for grade 3/4 neutropenia. There was a trend indicating that ABCB1_rs1128503 and ERCC1_rs11615 were potential risk factors (P<0.10) for grade 3/4 neutropenia in non-Asian patients.

The pandemic has also opened our eyes to the many threats that novel virus infections can pose for humanity. While numerous unknowns are being investigated in terms of the distributed damage that the virus can do to the human body, recent studies have also shown that the infection can lead to lifelong sequelae that could affect other parts of the body, and one example is the brain. As part of this work, we investigate how viral infection can affect the brain by modelling and simulating a neuron's behaviour under demyelination that is affected by the cytokine storm. We quantify the effects of cytokine-induced demyelination on the propagation of action potential signals within a neuron. We used information and communication theory analysis on the signal propagated through the axonal pathway under different intensity levels of demyelination to analyse these effects. Our simulations demonstrate that virus-induced degeneration can play a role in the signal power and spiking rate and the probability of releasing neurotransmitters and compromising the propagation and processing of information between the neurons. We also propose a transfer function that models these attenuation effects that degenerates the action potential, where this model has the potential to be used as a framework for the analysis of virus-induced neurodegeneration that can pave the way to improved understanding of virus-induced demyelination.","Adonias, Geoflly L.; Siljak, Harun; Barros, Michael Taynnan; Balasubramaniam, Sasitharan",,207,20

METHODS: The authors contextualize these regulations with European and international sets of principles, in the light of the characteristics that some psychiatric disorders can present. OBJECTIVES: Evaluate if such European principles need to be implemented with further specific exceptions to the obligation to stay at home for some people with mental disorders. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Prohibition to leave the house can aggravate mental disorders, resulting in the concrete risk of harmful actions, in particular in psychotic and bipolar patients, even with mild excitement, depressed patients, or in cases of delusional patients, resulting from uninterrupted cohabitation with emotionally significant family members. Even the health of subjects with anxiety pathologies, or with different forms of mental retardation can be prejudiced by forced permanence at home. From numerous provisions of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union there emerges that collective health must be balanced with individual health and with the dignity of the human person. CONCLUSIONS: As the European and international provisions are hierarchically above the national provisions, the latter should be interpreted so that the non-compliance to the obligation to stay at home: a) does not constitute offence for a person tested positive to the virus, if therapeutic treatments resulting in hospitalization are deemed necessary; b) it does not constitute administrative offence if the subject proves, based on clinical and factual documented evidence, that leaving the house is necessary to avoid recrudescence of mental disorder. In addition, for evaluation purposes, particular attention should be paid to the severity of psychiatric illness in the specific case.

We know that the route of transmission of the disease is through saliva droplets produced by speaking, coughing and sneezing. The virus is highly infectious, and each infected individual infects 2.5 people on average. The average incubation period is about 5 days, with an estimated range from 2 to 14 days; the incubation period in children is similar, however some have exhibited a longer incubation. The virus binds to the cellular receptor ACE2, which in children has a structural and functional immaturity thus offering lower affinity to the pathogen; this could explain the lower incidence of infection from SARS-CoV-2 in this segment of the population.The common clinical observation is that COVID-19 is less severe in children, and in this group the disease is often asymptomatic. Pending further clinical studies able to clarify the infection and transmission dynamics, it is therefore important to apply also in children all preventive and hygiene measures recommended by the health authorities during dental treatment. We should avoid procedures that generate aerosols as much as possible, minimising the use of the air syringe. When possible, it is recommended to employ minimally invasive procedures and ART (Atraumatic Restorative Treatment). The latter is a technique that can also be employed in very young and uncooperative patients with widespread carious lesions, in order to avoid more invasive and complex procedures. Ozone therapy could be of great help in the control of the progression of the asymptomatic carious lesions, especially during the Phase 2 of reopening, when we should to minimise the use of rotating instruments producing aerosols. The above introduces a new concept of ""no aerosol"" that will possibly guide our therapeutic choices not only in the immediate future but also in the long term, opening scenarios of prevention and cure that are more efficient, safe, and sustainable. During procedures that generate aerosols, the use of proper PPE is crucial to minimise the risk of transmission. It is also strongly recommended to work with an assistant, and to use double suction and a rubber dam. We will have to rethink and review the schedule of daily activities, in terms of timing and mode of delivery of care, on the basis of an agenda which can be divided into ""no aerosol"" and ""aerosol"" procedures, and ""virtual visits"" (including management of true emergencies), creating a virtuous optimisation of care for the safety of operators and office staff, as discussed in an article published on this very EJPD issue.

The current study aimed to examine the role of health-care services in the perceived community resilience of urban and suburban Arab communities in Israel during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHOD: The study included 196 adults age 17-76 years, who filled out on-line questionnaires in May 2020; 112 participants lived in an urban community and 84 lived in a suburban community. Community resilience was evaluated using the Conjoint Community Resiliency Assessment Measure (CCRAM), a validated five-factor multidimensional instrument. RESULTS: Residents of the suburban community reported higher community resilience than residents of the urban community. This difference was related to increased preparedness levels and strength of place attachment in the suburban community. Residents of suburban communities were also more satisfied and confident in health-care services than those of urban communities. Regression analysis showed that the satisfaction with primary health-care services, and not community type, significantly predicted community resilience. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the pivotal role of primary health care in building community resilience of minority communities in times of emergency and routine.","Cohen, Odeya; Mahagna, Alaa; Shamia, Asmaa; Slobodin, Ortal",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),207,20

Despite recent advances in NSCLC treatment, the five-year survival rate is still around 23%. Radiotherapy is indicated in the treatment of both early and advanced stage NSCLC; however, treatment response in patients is heterogeneous. Thus, identification of new and more effective treatment combinations is warranted. We have identified Ubiquitin-specific protease 14 (USP14) s a regulator of major double-strand break (DSB) repair pathways in response to ionizing radiation (IR) by its impact on both non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR) in NSCLC. USP14 is a proteasomal deubiquitinase. IR treatment increases levels and DSB recruitment of USP14 in NSCLC cell lines. Genetic knockdown, using shUSP14 expression or pharmacological inhibition of USP14, using IU1, increases radiosensitization in NSCLC cell lines, as determined by a clonogenic survival assay. Moreover, shUSP14-expressing NSCLC cells show increased NHEJ efficiency, as indicated by chromatin recruitment of key NHEJ proteins, NHEJ reporter assay, and increased IR-induced foci formation by 53BP1 and pS2056-DNA-PKcs. Conversely, shUSP14-expressing NSCLC cells show decreased RPA32 and BRCA1 foci formation, suggesting HR-deficiency. These findings identify USP14 as an important determinant of DSB repair in response to radiotherapy and a promising target for NSCLC radiosensitization.","Sharma, Arishya; Almasan, Alexandru",,207,21

As an upshot, countrywide lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic has been supportive of changing community mobility trends of various place categories including retail and recreation, groceries and pharmacies, parks, transit stations, workplaces, and residential in India. Objective: To analyze the impact of lockdown for COVID-19 on community mobility using spatial time-series change over different states and union territories (UTs) of India. Data & Methods: This study has been organized based on states & UTs wise time-series data of the daily percentage of change of community mobility from baseline in India, collected from 15th February to 30th April 2020. Conditional formatting techniques, time-series trends plotting method, spatial inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation mapping techniques have been employed to show pre and post lockdown mobility trends due to COVID-19 i.e. to fulfill the objective. Results: Across India, retail and recreation, grocery and pharmacy, visits to parks, transit stations, and workplaces mobility dropped by −73.4%, −51.2%, −46.3%, −66% and −56.7% respectively. Visits to residential places mobility increased by 23.8% as people mostly stayed home during the lockdown. The COVID-19 lockdown started on 24 March 2020 and just gone one day (March 25, 2020) of the beginning of lockdown, there have a decreased in percentage (−70.51% in retail and recreation mobility), (−64.26% in grocery and pharmacy mobility), (−46.17% in parks mobility), (−65.6% in transit stations mobility), (−60.03% in workplaces mobility) from baseline in compared to the pre-lockdown period and residential mobility has been increased in percentage (26.32%) from baseline due to people stayed home during the lockdown for COVID-19 pandemic in India.

CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive community and HCW engagement strategy combined with innovations to improve the supply chain are needed to increase COVID-19 swabbing in Papua New Guinea to reach national testing targets. Investments in increasing numbers of frontline workforce, consistent supplies of PPE, swabs, transport medium, cold boxes and ability to make ice packs, in addtion to establishing regular tranport of specimens from the facility to the testing site will strengthen the supply chain. Innovations are needed to address these issues.","Smaghi, Bernnedine S; Collins, Julie; Dagina, Rosheila; Hiawalyer, Gilbert; Vaccher, Stefanie; Flint, James; Housen, Tambri",Int. j. infect. dis,207,20

We aimed to identify their clinical characteristics to help early diagnosis. METHODS: We retrospectively retrieved data for laboratory-confirmed patients admitted with COVID-19-induced or influenza A-induced pneumonia from electronic medical records in Ningbo First Hospital, China. We recorded patients' epidemiological and clinical features, as well as radiologic and laboratory findings. RESULTS: The median age of influenza A cohort was higher and it exhibited higher temperature and higher proportion of pleural effusion. COVID-19 cohort exhibited higher proportions of fatigue, diarrhea and ground-glass opacity and higher levels of lymphocyte percentage, absolute lymphocyte count, red-cell count, hemoglobin and albumin and presented lower levels of monocytes, c-reactive protein, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, serum creatinine. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that fatigue, ground-glass opacity, and higher level of albumin were independent risk factors for COVID-19 pneumonia, while older age, higher temperature, and higher level of monocyte count were independent risk factors for influenza A pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: In terms of COVID-19 pneumonia and influenza A pneumonia, fatigue, ground-glass opacity, and higher level of albumin tend to be helpful for diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia, while older age, higher temperature, and higher level of monocyte count tend to be helpful for the diagnosis of influenza A pneumonia.","Lv, Ding-Feng; Ying, Qi-Ming; He, Yi-Wen; Liang, Jun; Zhang, Ji-Hong; Lu, Bei-Bei; Qian, Guo-Qing; Chu, Jin-Guo; Weng, Xing-Bei; Chen, Xue-Qin; Mu, Qi-Tian",J Clin Lab Anal,207,1

The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence of COVID-19 among travellers and workers in Bukavu, a city in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. Methods: between May and August 2020, the Cellex qSARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM Rapid Test (Cellex, Inc., USA), lateral flow immunoassay was used to rapidly detect and differentiate antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 among travellers and workers seeking medical certification. Results: among the 684 residents of the city of Bukavu screened for COVID-19 (4.2% Hispanic, 2.8% other African, 0.9% Asian), the seroprevalence anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 40.8% (IgG+/IgM+: 34.6%; IgG+/IgM-: 0.5%; IgG-/IgM+: 5.4%). Cumulative seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies increased from 24.5% to 35.2% from May to August 2020. Independent predictors of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were age > 60 years [adjusted OR = 2.07(1.26-3.38)] and non-membership of the medical staff [adjusted OR = 2.28 (1.22-4.26)]. Thirteen point nine percent of patients seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were symptomatic and hospitalized. Conclusion: this study shows a very high seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among travellers and workers in Bukavu, a city in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, which may positively affect community immunity in the study population.

Detecting lung cancer is challenging due to nonspecific symptom presentation. Literature was reviewed to consider functional decline as an indicator for ill-health. This study explored the process experienced from recognition in a change of health to receiving a lung cancer diagnosis from a patient's perspective in order to examine this phase through a biopsychosocial lens. Patients and Methods: A single-case design methodology was used for this study. The method of data collection was semi-structured interviews with people diagnosed with lung cancer utilizing criterion sampling. The case study was bound by diagnostic and geographical factors to frame the single-case: participants were limited to those living in Alaska diagnosed with stage III or stage IV lung cancer. Results: One (n = 1) person participated in this study. Themes consistent with lung cancer detection process from a patient's perspective include symptom denial, symptom reductionism, and gradual impact on function. Conclusion: Although the number of participants was extremely limited due to the COVID-19 pandemic at the time of recruitment, this case study suggests a decline in function present prior to being diagnosed with lung cancer. Opportunities exist within the provider and patient interface to promote earlier detection include educating medical providers to ask specific, closed-ended, non-disease related functional questions to ascertain more details and a holistic representation of patients' health. Raising public awareness of lung cancer symptoms, such as fatigue and dyspnea, is also warranted.","Kowalski, L.",Journal of multidisciplinary healthcare,207,17

The detection of Covid-19 positive cases is an important step to fight the pandemic and save human lives. The polymerase chain reaction test is the most used method to detect Covid-19 positive cases. Various molecular methods and serological methods have also been explored to detect Covid-19 positive cases. Machine learning algorithms have been applied to various kinds of datasets to predict Covid-19 positive cases. The machine learning algorithms were applied on a Covid-19 dataset based on commonly taken laboratory tests to predict Covid-19 positive cases. These types of datasets are easy to collect. The paper investigates the application of decision tree ensembles which are accurate and robust to the selection of parameters. As there is an imbalance between the number of positive cases and the number of negative cases, decision tree ensembles developed for imbalanced datasets are applied. F-measure, precision, recall, area under the precision-recall curve, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve are used to compare different decision tree ensembles. Different performance measures suggest that decision tree ensembles developed for imbalanced datasets perform better. Results also suggest that including age as a variable can improve the performance of various ensembles of decision trees.","Ahmad, Amir Safi Ourooj Sharaf Malebary Alesawi Sami Alkayal Entisar",Complexity,207,16

Cargo molecules carried by EVs were shown to contribute to the physiological functions of endothelium and may support the plasticity and adaptation of endothelial cells in a paracrine manner. Endothelium-derived vesicles can also contribute to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease or can serve as prognostic or diagnostic biomarkers. Finally, endothelium-derived EVs can be used as therapeutic tools to target endothelium for drug delivery or target stromal cells via the endothelial cells.

Methods: A Critical Care Task Force was established between Kansas City area intensive care units to allow for preparedness for potential surges by sharing of bed capacity both in the ICU and hospital, and ventilator capacity as well as weekly web-based meetings to share resource concerns and best practice. This Task Force also collected patient information to understand the dynamics of community impact and resource needs better. This effort allowed for compilation and dissemination of information regarding data that describe characteristics of patients with COVID-19 compared to a random sample of medical ICU patients with conditions other than COVID-19.Demographic and therapeutic factors affecting patients admitted to medical intensive care units in the Kansas City metro area are reported from May 5, 2020 until June 2, 2020 using a retrospective case-control study examining gender, race, and therapeutic options including modes of ventilation, vasopressor requirements, renal-replacement therapy, and disposition. Results: During data collection, patients being treated for COVID-19 in intensive care units in the Kansas City metropolitan area were more likely to be older, less likely to be white, and less likely to be immunosuppressed as compared to those being treated for non-COVID illnesses. They were more likely to require non-invasive ventilation and undergo prone positioning but were equally likely to require invasive ventilation and other organ supportive therapy. Conclusions: Hospitalized patients being treated for COVID-19 in the Kansas City metropolitan area have similar demographics to those being reported in the U.S. including age and race.

METHODS: A 17-item electronic survey was sent to 496 undergraduate dental students and 53 clinical faculty members who attended clinical sessions during the outbreak period. The survey explored various aspects related to primary sources and prevention of disease exposure, dental management of suspected cases, impact of COVID-19 on students' clinical performance and effects of suspension of educational activities on academic performance and clinical competence. RESULTS: The response rate of the students' was 60.7% (n = 301). The majority of students reported that performing clinical work during the outbreak posed significant health concerns, resulted in a significant stress and negatively affected their clinical performance. The majority of students believed that aerosols generated during dental procedures are the major source for disease exposure and universal protective equipment is not effective for prevention. The decision to suspend teaching activities was supported by 89% of the students. Opinions were divided regarding the impact of the suspension on the academic performance and clinical competence. Educational videos were the most preferred form of distance education. The response rate of faculty members was 60.4% (n = 32). Responses of faculty members were similar to students, though fewer concerns were reported regarding the risk of disease transmission. All respondents agreed that extra-precautionary measures are required to ensure optimum protection against disease exposure. CONCLUSIONS: The recent COVID-19 outbreak has adversely affected various elements of dental education. High levels of major health risk perception were noted amongst students and educators. The interruption to academic and clinical activities may lead to an inevitable skill deficit within the new generation of dental graduates. Educators are under significant pressure to accommodate abrupt changes in teaching methods, find solutions to mitigate skill deficit and ensure safe clinical practice once clinical activities are resumed.","Jum039,; ah, Ahmad A; Elsalem, Lina; Loch, Carolina; Schwass, Donald; Brunton, Paul A",Eur. j. dent. educ,207,9

This pandemic disease is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus has been reported to be originated in bats and by yet unknown intermediary animals were transmitted to humans in China 2019. The SARSCoV- 2 spreads faster than its two ancestors the SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERSCoV) but has reduced fatality. At present, the SARS-CoV-2 has caused about a 1.16 million of deaths with more than 43.4 million confirmed cases worldwide, resulting in a serious threat to public health globally with yet uncertain impact. The disease is transmitted by inhalation or direct contact with an infected person. The incubation period ranges from 1 to 14 days. COVID-19 is accompanied by various symptoms, including cough, fatigue. In most people the disease is mild, but in some other people, such as in elderly and people with chronic diseases, it may progress from pneumonia to a multi-organ dysfunction. Many people are reported asymptomatic. The virus genome is sequenced, but new variants are reported. Numerous biochemical aspects of its structure and function are revealed. To date, no clinically approved vaccines and/or specific therapeutic drugs are available to prevent or treat the COVID-19. However, there are reported intensive researches on the SARSCoV- 2 to potentially identify vaccines and/or drug targets, which may help to overcome the disease. In this review, we discuss recent advances in understanding the molecular structure of SARS-CoV-2 and its biochemical characteristics.","Dërmaku-Sopjani, Miribane; Sopjani, Mentor",Current molecular medicine (Online),207,8

COVID-19 ARDS displays the typical features of diffuse alveolar damage with extensive pulmonary coagulation activation resulting in fibrin deposition in the microvasculature and formation of hyaline membranes in the air sacs. Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 who manifest severe disease have high levels of inflammatory cytokines in plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and significant coagulopathy. There is a strong association between the extent of the coagulopathy and poor clinical outcomes.The anti-coagulant actions of nebulised UFH limit fibrin deposition and microvascular thrombosis. Trials in patients with acute lung injury and related conditions found inhaled UFH reduced pulmonary dead space, coagulation activation, microvascular thrombosis and clinical deterioration, resulting in increased time free of ventilatory support. In addition, UFH has anti-inflammatory, mucolytic and anti-viral properties and, specifically, has been shown to inactivate the SARS-CoV-2 virus and prevent its entry into mammalian cells, thereby inhibiting pulmonary infection by SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, clinical studies have shown that inhaled UFH safely improves outcomes in other inflammatory respiratory diseases and also acts as an effective mucolytic in sputum-producing respiratory patients. UFH is widely available and inexpensive, which may make this treatment also accessible for low- and middle-income countries.These potentially important therapeutic properties of nebulised UFH underline the need for expedited large-scale clinical trials to test its potential to reduce mortality in COVID-19 patients.","van Haren, Frank M P; Page, Clive; Laffey, John G; Artigas, Antonio; Camprubi-Rimblas, Marta; Nunes, Quentin; Smith, Roger; Shute, Janis; Carroll, Mary; Tree, Julia; Carroll, Miles; Singh, Dave; Wilkinson, Tom; Dixon, Barry",Crit Care,207,12

Upon review of the literature there are only a few cases reported of acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) in COVID-19 patients after treatment. Therefore, we are reporting a case of a 34-year-old male not known to have any chronic illness. His severe COVID-19 infection resolved four days prior to presentation to the Emergency Department with pustular rash on erythematous base over his face, neck, upper limbs, anterior and posterior trunk including oral cavity and tounge. The rash started after he took azithromycin, oseltamivir, ribavirin, lopinavir, hydroxychloroquine, prednisolone, ceftriaxone, clindamycin, interferon (IFN) beta, and ceftazidime for COVID-19. Skin punch biopsy was done and he was diagnosed with AGEP but it was still not known if it was related to COVID-19 or a drug-induced condition. Patient was treated with betamethasone valerate 0.1% ointment and lotion, promethazine hydrochloride 25mg tablet, paracetamol 500mg tablet, calcipotriol 50mcg/g and betamethasone 0.5mg/g gel. He discharged the same day to manage at home despite not improving. In the end, we found only a few studies that describe the cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 infection, which were mainly case reports. We can't be sure that AGEP is a late and severe complication of COVID-19 infection. However, AGEP could be a rare adverse effect of hydroxychloroquine therapy.

We observe that during the second half of the first and second waves, the COVID-19 deaths are significantly higher than the excess mortality. We attribute the difference to the pre-dying effect. We then compare the excess mortality to the official COVID-19 death numbers and calculate the infection fatality rates (IFRs) and the percentage of infected individuals from excess mortality for different age bands. We also compare the impact of COVID-19 to past influenza waves and analyze the vaccination effect on excess mortality. MethodsWe forecast the baseline mortality from official data on deaths in Germany. Distributing a part of excess mortality into the near future, we lower the baseline simulating the pre-dying effect. From there, we compare the excess mortality to official COVID-19 deaths. From the observed mortality deficit, we estimate the percentage of infected individuals and then estimate the age-dependent IFRs. ResultsIn the first wave, we find an overall excess mortality of ca. 8 000. For the second wave, the overall excess mortality adds up to ca. 56 000. We find, that the pre-dying effect explains the difference between the official COVID-19 deaths and excess mortality in the second half of the waves to a high degree. Attributing the whole excess mortality to COVID-19, we find that the IFRs are significantly higher in the second wave. In the third wave, we find an excess mortality in mid-age bands which cannot be explained by the official COVID-19 deaths. For the senior band 80+, we find results in favor of a strong and positive vaccination effect for the third COVID-19 wave. ConclusionsWe conclude that in the first and second COVID-19 waves, the COVID-19 deaths explain almost all excess mortality when the pre-dying effect is taken into account. In the third wave in 2021, the excess mortality is not very pronounced for the 80+ age band, probably due to vaccination. The partially unvaccinated 40-80 age group experiences a pronounced excess mortality in the third wave while there are too few official COVID-19 deaths to explain the excess. The no-vaccination scenario for the 80+ age band results in a similarly high excess mortality as for the more younger age bands, suggesting a very positive vaccination effect on reduction of COVID-19 deaths.","Weber, Alexej",,207,4

However, differences in the S protein are much more than serological or antigenic variants, resulting in the effective presence of two distinct viruses. Here, we review the distinct differences in the S proteins of these viruses, which are likely to translate into distinct biological outcomes. We introduce a new concept related to the non-taxonomical classification and differentiation among FCoVs by analyzing and comparing the genetic, structural, and functional characteristics of FCoV and the FCoV S protein among the two serotypes and FCoV biotypes. Based on our analysis, we suggest that our understanding of FIP needs to consider whether the presence of these two distinct viruses has implications in clinical settings.","Jaimes, Javier A; Millet, Jean K; Stout, Alison E; André, Nicole M; Whittaker, Gary R",Viruses,207,1

For example, an increasing NLR is a risk factor of mortality in sepsis. It also appears to be helpful in other settings such as cancer. The aim of our work was to study the prognostic value of NLR for disease severity and mortality in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 upon their admission to the Emergency Department (ED) and its early variation (ΔNLR) in the first 24 h of management (H-24). (2) Methods: Between 1 March and 30 April 2020, we conducted a multicenter and retrospective cohort study of patients with moderate or severe coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), who were all hospitalized after presenting to the ED. (3) Results: A total of 1035 patients were included in our study. Factors associated with infection severity were C-reactive protein level (OR: 1.007, CI 95%: [1.005–1.010], p &lt;0.001), NLR at H-24 (OR: 1.117, CI 95%: [1.060–1.176], p &lt;0.001), and ΔNLR (OR: 1.877, CI 95%: [1.160–3.036], p: 0.01). The best threshold of ΔNLR to predict the severity of infection was 0.222 (sensitivity 56.1%, specificity 68.3%). In multivariate analysis, the only biochemical factor significantly associated with mortality was again ΔNLR (OR: 2.142, CI 95%: ([1.132–4.056], p: 0.019). The best threshold of ΔNLR to predict mortality was 0.411 (sensitivity 53.3%;specificity 67.3%). (4) Conclusion: The NLR and its early variation (ΔNLR) could help physicians predict both severity and mortality associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, hence contributing to optimized patient management (accurate triage and treatment).","Abensur Vuillaume, Laure Le Borgne Pierrick Alamé Karine Lefebvre François Bérard Lise Delmas Nicolas Cipolat Lauriane Gennai Stéphane Bilbault Pascal Lavoignet Charles-Eric Network on behalf of the CREMS",Journal of Clinical Medicine,207,24

Hospitalization and death of COVID-19 patients in the countries most affected by the pandemic has been associated to chronic comorbidities. OBJECTIVE: To describe the prevalence of NCDs in patients with COVID-19 in Mexico and analyze the increased risk due to comorbidities and risk factors on hospitalization, utilization of intensive care units and death. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed from 212,802 confirmed COVID-19 cases reported by the Ministry of Health up to June 27, 2020. Odds ratios were performed using logistic regression model. RESULTS: Up to 47.40% of patients with COVID-19 diagnosis were also reported with a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most frequent (20.12%). The report of at least one NCD significantly increased the risk of death with respect to patients without such diagnoses. Chronic kidney disease increased the risk of death the most (OR 2.31), followed by diabetes (OR 1.69), immunosuppression (OR 1.62), obesity (OR 1.42), hypertension (OR 1.24), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR 1.20). The comorbidities that most increased the risk of ICU and of intubation were diabetes, immunosuppression and obesity. CONCLUSION: NCD comorbidities increase the severity of COVID-19 infection. Given high NCD prevalence rates among the Mexican population, the pandemic poses a special threat to the health system and to society. Special prevention measures need to be strengthened for persons with NCD diagnoses in the short-term. In the mid-term, disease control strategies need to be improved to protect these patients against COVID-19 severity.","Hernández-Galdamez, Diego Rolando; González-Block, Miguel Ángel; Romo-Dueñas, Daniela Karola; Lima-Morales, René; Hernández-Vicente, Irma Alejandra; Lumbreras-Guzmán, Marivel; Méndez-Hernández, Pablo",Arch. med. res,207,16

Under the circumstances created during lockdown period, children are deprived from the social interaction and companionship; because of which, they are susceptible to psychiatric disorders. Therefore, in this study, efforts were to understand the impacts of lockdown on the mental status of the children of India and their specific causes. STUDY DESIGN: It is a questionnaire-based study. METHODS: A web-based questionnaire was prepared, and 400 parents from four districts of Punjab, India, namely, Ludhiana, Sahibzada Ajit Singh (SAS) Nagar, Sangrur and Ferozepur, were telephonically interviewed. Further, the information collected from the interviews was statistically analysed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software. RESULTS: Findings from this study revealed that 73.15% and 51.25% of the children were having signs of increased irritation and anger, respectively; 18.7% and 17.6% of the parents also mentioned the symptoms of depression and anxiety, respectively, among their children, which were also augmented by the changes in their diet, sleep, weight and more usage of the electronic equipment. Children (~76.3%) persistently urge to go outdoors and play with their friends; therefore, they could lag in social development. Further, observations from Pearson's correlation revealed that during lockdown, children's mental health is significantly related to the area of their house, number of children in the family, qualification of their mother and socio-economic status of their family. CONCLUSIONS: This study made it evident that the mental health of the children residing in Punjab, India, was compromised during the lockdown period induced by the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings of this study may also trigger the international authorities to frame the guidelines of lockdown in the interest of mental health of their native children.","Sama, Bhupinder Kaur; Kaur, Palakpreet; Thind, Parteek Singh; Verma, Manpreet Kaur; Kaur, Mandeep; Singh, Dapinder Deep",Child Care Health Dev,207,20

In The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, the expression level of lncRNA forkhead box P4 antisense RNA 1 (FOXP4-AS1) is higher in NPC samples than in normal samples. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Quantitative Real-time PCR and Western blotting were performed to detect the expression level of RNA and protein. Luciferase reporter assay ran to test the interactions between FOXP4-AS1 and miR-423-5p and STMN1. Subcellular fractionation assay was used to determine the subcellular localization of FOXP4-AS1. The tumor-promotion functions of FOXP4-AS1 were determined by both in vitro and in vivo assays. RESULTS: The expression of FOXP4-AS1 was up-regulated in 80 cases with NPC, and these patients with a poor prognosis. Functionally, high expression of FOXP4-AS1 in NPC was connected with promoted cell proliferation and inhibited apoptosis. Moreover, FOXP4-AS1 is located in the cytoplasm of CNE1 (NPC cell lines). Mechanistically, FOXP4-AS1 up-regulated STMN1 on post-transcriptional regulation by means of miR-423-5p. CONCLUSIONS: Our present study demonstrated that high expression of FOXP4-AS1 in NPC portended poor outcomes.

Currently, there are no specific therapeutic agents for coronavirus infections. Convalescent plasma (CP) therapy is a potentially effective treatment option. METHODS: Patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and had been discharged from the hospital for more than 2 weeks were recruited. COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP)-specific donor screening and selection were performed based on the following criteria: 1) aged 18-55 years; 2) eligible for blood donation; 3) diagnosed with COVID-19; 4) had two consecutive negative COVID-19 nasopharyngeal swab tests based on PCR (at least 24 hr apart) prior to hospital discharge; 5) had been discharged from the hospital for more than 2 weeks; and 6) had no COVID-19 symptoms prior to convalescent plasma donation. In addition, preference was given to CCP donors who had a fever lasting more than 3 days or a body temperature exceeding 38.5°C (101.3°F), and who donated 4 weeks after the onset of symptoms. CCP collection was performed using routine plasma collection procedures via plasmapheresis. In addition to routine donor testing, the CCP donors' plasma was also tested for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid and S-RBD-specific IgG antibody. RESULTS: Of the 81 potential CCP donors, 64 (79%) plasma products were collected. There were 18 female donors and 46 male donors. There were 34 first-time blood donors and 30 repeat donors. The average time between CCP collection and initial symptom onset was 49.1 days, and the average time between CCP collection and hospital discharge was 38.7 days. The average volume of CCP collected was 327.7 mL. All Alanine transaminase (ALT) testing results met blood donation requirements. HIV Ag/Ab, anti-HCV, anti-syphilis, and HBsAg were all negative; NAT for HIV, HBV, and HCV were also negative. In addition, all of the CCP donors' plasma units were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Of the total 64 CCP donors tested, only one had an S-RBD-specific IgG titer of 1:160, all others had a titer of &#8805;1:320. CONCLUSION: Based on a feasibility study of a pilot CCP program in Wuhan, China, we demonstrated the success and feasibility of CCP collection. In addition, all of the CCP units collected had a titer of &#8805;1:160 for S-RBD-specific IgG antibody, which met the CCP quality control requirements based on the Chinese national guidelines for CCP.","Li, Ling; Yang, Ru; Wang, Jue; Lv, Qilu; Ren, Ming; Zhao, Lei; Chen, Hanwei; Xu, Haixia; Xie, Songli; Xie, Jin; Lin, Hui; Li, Wenjuan; Fang, Peng; Gong, Li; Wang, Lan; Wu, Yanyun; Liu, Zhong",Transfusion,207,1

Host cell surface heparan sulfate (HS) is believed to interact with SARS-CoV-2 SGPs to facilitate host cell entry. In the current study, a series of polysaccharides from Saccharina japonica were prepared to investigate the structure-activity relationship on the binding abilities of polysaccharides (oligosaccharides) to pseudotype particles, including SARS-CoV-2 SGPs, and ACE2 using surface plasmon resonance. Sulfated galactofucan (SJ-D-S-H) and glucuronomannan (Gn) displayed strongly inhibited interaction between SARS-CoV-2 SGPs and heparin while showing negligible inhibition of the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 SGPs and ACE2. The IC50 values of SJ-D-S-H and Gn in blocking heparin SGP binding were 27 and 231 nM, respectively. NMR analysis showed that the structure of SJ-D-S-H featured with a backbone of 1, 3-linked &#945;-L-Fucp residues sulfated at C4 and C2/C4 and 1, 3-linked &#945;-L-Fucp residues sulfated at C4 and branched with 1, 6-linked ß-D-galacto-biose; Gn had a backbone of alternating 1, 4-linked ß-D-GlcAp residues and 1, 2-linked &#945;-D-Manp residues. The sulfated galactofucan and glucuronomannan showed strong binding ability to SARS-CoV-2 SGPs, suggesting that these polysaccharides might be good candidates for preventing and/or treating SARS-CoV-2.","Jin, Weihua; Zhang, Wenjing; Mitra, Dipanwita; McCandless, Martin G; Sharma, Poonam; Tandon, Ritesh; Zhang, Fuming; Linhardt, Robert J",Int J Biol Macromol,207,21

The COVID-19 epidemic in Greece was explored through a Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis framework, and the optimal values for the parameters that determined the transmission dynamics could be obtained before, during, and after the interventions to control the epidemic. The dynamic change of the fraction of asymptomatic individuals was shown. The analysis of the modelling results at the intra-annual climatic scale allowed for in depth investigation of the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and the significance and relative importance of the model parameters. Moreover, the analysis at this scale incorporated the exploration of the forecast horizon and its variability. Three discrete peaks were found in the transmission rates throughout the investigated period (15 February-15 December 2020). Two of them corresponded to the timing of the spring and autumn epidemic waves while the third one occurred in mid-summer, implying that relaxation of social distancing and increased mobility may have a strong effect on rekindling the epidemic dynamics offsetting positive effects from factors such as decreased household crowding and increased environmental ultraviolet radiation. In addition, the epidemiological state was found to constitute a significant indicator of the forecast reliability horizon, spanning from as low as few days to more than four weeks. Embedding the model in an ensemble framework may extend the predictability horizon. Therefore, it may contribute to the accuracy of health risk assessment and inform public health decision making of more efficient control measures.","Kioutsioukis, Ioannis; Stilianakis, Nikolaos I",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),207,23

Many countries have partially or entirely shut down their international flights during this period to contain the spread of COVID-19. However, the changes in the international connectivity of different countries during this period varied greatly, as the ATNs of different countries have different structures. Accordingly, this paper studies the impact of network topology on the international robustness of a country?s ATN to pandemic-induced disruptions. Therein, a Weighted International Efficiency metric is proposed to evaluate a country?s connectivity to other countries, followed by deriving an International Robustness metric that measures the ability of a country?s ATN to maintain international connections during pandemics. Further, three internal and external topological metrics are defined to characterize the structure of an ATN. The results of correlation and regression analysis show that the proportion of international airports inside a country is the most important factor in determining its international robustness to pandemics, followed by the density of the domestic connections. Surprisingly, the number of directly connected foreign cities has little effect on international robustness. The analysis demonstrates the importance of studying ATN topology during emergencies.

Here, using anonymized mobile geolocation data in China, we devise a mobility-associated social contact index to quantify the impact of both physical distancing and vaccination measures in a unified way. Building on this index, our epidemiological model reveals that vaccination combined with physical distancing can contain resurgences without relying on stay-at-home restrictions, whereas a gradual vaccination process alone cannot achieve this. Further, for cities with medium population density, vaccination can reduce the duration of physical distancing by 36% to 78%, whereas for cities with high population density, infection numbers can be well-controlled through moderate physical distancing. These findings improve our understanding of the joint effects of vaccination and physical distancing with respect to a city's population density and social contact patterns.","Huang, Bo; Wang, Jionghua; Cai, Jixuan; Yao, Shiqi; Chan, Paul Kay Sheung; Tam, Tony Hong-Wing; Hong, Ying-Yi; Ruktanonchai, Corrine W; Carioli, Alessandra; Floyd, Jessica R; Ruktanonchai, Nick W; Yang, Weizhong; Li, Zhongjie; Tatem, Andrew J; Lai, Shengjie",,207,24

A very strict lockdown at home was imposed with a tough restriction of mobility. We aimed to evaluate the impact of this exceptional scenario on glucose profile of patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) prone to hypoglycaemia using sensor-augmented pump (SAP). METHODS: Patients with T1D prone to hypoglycaemia using SAP (640G Medtronic-Minimed®) for at least 6 months under the funding of a National Health Service were included in an observational, retrospective study. Data were collected in two periods: pre-lockdown (PL), February 23rd-March 7th and within lockdown (WL), April 1st to 14th 2020. The primary outcome was the difference in the proportion of time in target glucose range of 70-180 mg/dL (TIR). Additional glucometric data and total daily insulin were also analysed. RESULTS: Fifty-nine patients were included: 33 women, age 46.17 ± 13.0 years and disease duration of 30.2 ± 12.0 years. TIR 70-180 mg/dL (67.6 ± 11.8 vs. 69.8 ± 12.0%), time > 180 (28.1 ± 13.6 vs. 25.5 ± 13.1%), time > 250 (6.9 ± 6.1 vs. 5.1 ± 4.8) and estimated HbA1c (6.94 ± 0.8 vs. 6.75 ± 0.7%) significantly improved (PL vs. WL, respectively, p < 0.05). Time in hypoglycaemia, coefficient of variation, sensor usage and total daily insulin dose remained unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: Lockdown conditions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic may be managed successfully in terms of glycaemia control by population with DT1 prone to hypoglycaemia using SAP. The strict daily routine at home could probably explain the improvement in the time in glycemic target without increasing the time hypoglycaemia.","Viñals, Clara; Mesa, Alex; Roca, Daria; Vidal, Merce; Pueyo, Irene; Conget, Ignacio; Giménez, Marga",Acta diabetol,207,13

With the impact being less than predicted, on May 26, 2020, elective surgeries and non-essential activities were permitted to resume. OBJECTIVES: To examine outcomes following elective aesthetic surgery and the impact on the Canadian health care system with the resumption of these services during the COVID-19 worldwide pandemic. METHODS: Data was collected in a prospective manner on consecutive patients undergoing elective plastic surgery procedures in six accredited ambulatory surgery facilities. Data included patient demographics, procedural characteristics, COVID-19 PCR test status, airway management and postoperative outcomes. RESULTS: 368 patients underwent elective surgical procedures requiring a general anesthetic. All 368 patients that underwent surgery were negative on pre visit screening. A COVID-19 PCR test was completed by 352 patients (95.7%) and all were negative. In the postoperative period, seven patients (1.9%) had complications, three patients (0.8%) required a hospital visit, and one patient (0.3%) required hospital admission. No patients or health care providers developed COVID-19 symptoms or had a positive test for COVID-19 within 30 days of surgery. CONCLUSIONS: With appropriate screening and safety precautions, elective aesthetic plastic surgery can be performed in a manner that is safe for patients and health care providers and with a very low risk for accelerating virus transmission within the community.","Brown, Mitchell; Eardley, Stephanie; Ahmad, Jamil; Lista, Frank; Barr, Scott; Mulholland, Stephen; Khanna, Julie; Knapp, Charles; Saheb-Al-Zamani, Maryam; Austin, Ryan; Levine, Ronald",Aesthet. surg. j,207,16

First, participants were randomized to 4 months of continuous high-intensity aerobic exercise (AEX) and RT 3x/week or standard of care control. Then, the control group completed 4 months of HIIT + RT (3x/week). Among the 32 individuals enrolled, 26 eligible participants were randomized.

The purpose of this research was to determine CL use, compliance and patient-practitioner communication during a 3-month long COVID-19 lockdown in Spain. METHODS: An online survey (developed using Google Forms) retrospectively evaluated CL compliance during the 3-month lockdown (responses captured between 15th July and 10th August, 2020), with particular emphasis on patient-practitioner communication, handwashing practices and CL case hygiene and replacement. RESULTS: A total of 247 responses were collected and analysed. Most participants used monthly replacement soft lenses (64.8 %) and multipurpose solutions (75.7 %), with 86.6 % of them owning a storage case for their lenses. During lockdown, a significant percentage of participants ceased lens wear (28.4 %) or reduced wearing time (49.2 %). Regarding patient-practitioner communication, 54.3 % of respondents received specific instructions, mostly about handwashing (93.3 %) and storage case hygiene (48.5 %). The most frequent non-compliant practices were inadequate handwashing (36.4 %), and overextending monthly or two-weekly replacement lenses (35.2 %). Many respondents never cleaned (23.0 %) nor replaced (16.3 %) their storage case, and 27.8 % of them reported not having been informed about case hygiene by their practitioners. CONCLUSION: Contact lens compliance, particularly in terms of handwashing and storage case hygiene, was poor during a prolonged COVID-19 lockdown, thus stressing the need to foster patient-practitioner communication strategies to curtail the possibility of ocular transmission and the risk of virus tropism.","Cardona, Genis; Alonso, Silvia; Busquets, Anna",Cont Lens Anterior Eye,207,26

As patients of all ages are affected, radiation dose is a concern. While follow-up CT examinations lead to high cumulative radiation doses, the ALARA principle states that the applied dose should be as low as possible while maintaining adequate image quality. The aim of this study was to evaluate parameter settings for two commonly used CT scanners to ensure sufficient image quality/diagnostic confidence at a submillisievert dose. Materials and methods: We retrospectively analyzed 36 proven COVID-19 cases examined on two different scanners. Image quality was evaluated objectively as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)/contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) measurement and subjectively by two experienced, independent readers using 3-point Likert scales. CT dose index volume (CTDIvol) and dose-length product (DLP) were extracted from dose reports, and effective dose was calculated. Results: With the tested parameter settings we achieved effective doses below 1 mSv (median 0.5 mSv, IQR: 0.2 mSv, range: 0.3-0.9 mSv) in all 36 patients.

In the absence of play and catastrophic economic losses, wealthy managers and executives have been encouraged, from a financial perspective, to accept wage freezes and reductions. Players have also been encouraged to do so as part of an effort in solidarity. This paper considers the ethical dimension of such gestures and how these have been received. How is the footballer, rendered physically incapable in such circumstances to prove sporting worth, to be critiqued? A new pandemic morality, it is argued, has emerged, one that takes an austere view of footballers and their conduct. Appraised as such, these figures are seen less as heroic beings than citizens engaged in a common cause and reviled for not doing so, a return, it is contended, to the principle of amateurishness.

The pandemics have led to contemporary practice-related questions, such as: does professionalism entail that health care providers (HCP) be compelled to treat patients without PPE or if patients refuse to wear masks? And what role do HCP play in society when confronted with glaring health disparities and police brutality? The authors propose using care ethics as a theory to view professionalism, as it takes into account broadly encompassing relationships between HCP and society, history and context. Professionalism viewed through a care ethics lens would require professionalism definitions to be expanded to allow for interventions, i.e., not just refrain from doing harm but actively interfere or take action if wrong is being witnessed. Principles related to the primacy of patient welfare need to be re-addressed to prevent systematic self-sacrifice which results in harm to HCP and burnout. Mature care should be a characteristic of professionalism ensuring that HCP care for the sick but be practically wise, highlighting the importance of balancing too little and too much care for self and others. Professionalism needs to be viewed as a bi-directional relational exchange, with society demonstrating solidarity with those providing care. Additionally, given the scale of health disparities, simply stating that HCP need to work towards social justice oversimplifies the problem. Professionalism needs to encompass incorporating critical action and critical pedagogy into health care training and the health care profession to demonstrate solidarity with those impacted by racism.","Zaidi, Zareen; Razack, Saleem; Kumagai, Arno K",Perspectives on medical education,207,24

RECENT FINDINGS: Molecular biology approaches, including PCR and whole genome sequencing (WGS), have become powerful tools for epidemiological investigation. PCR approaches form the basis for many high-sensitivity diagnostic tests and can supplement traditional contact tracing and surveillance strategies to define risk networks and transmission patterns. WGS approaches can further define the causative agents of disease, trace the origins of the pathogen, and clarify routes of transmission. When coupled with clinical datasets, such as electronic medical record data, these approaches can investigate co-correlates of disease and pathogenesis. In the ongoing HIV epidemic, these approaches have been effectively deployed to identify treatment gaps, transmission clusters and risk factors, though significant barriers to rapid or real-time implementation remain critical to overcome. Likewise, these approaches have been successful in addressing some questions of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and pathogenesis, but the nature and rapid spread of the virus have posed additional challenges. SUMMARY: Overall, molecular epidemiology approaches offer unique advantages and challenges that complement traditional epidemiological tools for the improved understanding and management of epidemics.","Lorenzo-Redondo, Ramon; Ozer, Egon A; Achenbach, Chad J; D039,; Aquila, Richard T; Hultquist, Judd F",Curr Opin HIV AIDS,207,16

Many countries of the world, including India, closed their borders and imposed a nationwide lockdown. In India, the lockdown was declared on March 24 for 21 days (March 25-April 14, 2020) and was later extended until May 3, 2020. During the lockdown, all major anthropogenic activities, which contribute to atmospheric pollution (such as industries, vehicles, and businesses), were restricted. The current study examines the impact of the lockdown on tropospheric NO2 concentrations. Satellite-based ozone monitoring instrument sensor data were analyzed in order to investigate the variations in tropospheric NO2 concentrations. The results showed that from March 1 to 21, 2020, the average tropospheric NO2 concentration was 214.4 ×1013 molecule cm-2 over India, and it subsequently decreased by 12.1% over the next four weeks. An increase of 0.8% in tropospheric NO2 concentrations was observed for the same period in 2019 and hence, the reduced tropospheric NO2 concentrations can be attributed to restricted anthropogenic activities during the lockdown. In the absence of significant activities, the contribution of various sources was estimated, and the emissions from biomass burning were identified as a major source of tropospheric NO2 during the lockdown. The findings of this study provide an opportunity to understand the mechanism of tropospheric NO2 emissions over India, in order to improve air quality modeling and management strategies.","Biswal, Akash; Singh, Tanbir; Singh, Vikas; Ravindra, Khaiwal; Mor, Suman",Heliyon,207,1

Following re-opening, schools resumed operation at a reduced level for nine weeks. During this phase, we aimed at assessing, among students and teachers, infection status, symptoms, individual behaviour, and institutional infection prevention measures. Twenty-four primary and secondary school classes, randomly selected across Berlin, were examined. Oro-nasopharyngeal swabs and capillary blood samples were collected to determine SARS-CoV-2 infection (PCR) and specific IgG (ELISA), respectively. Medical history, household characteristics, leisure activities, fear of infection, risk perception, hand hygiene, facemask wearing, and institutional preventive measures were assessed. Descriptive analysis was performed. Among 535 participants (385 students, 150 staff), one teenager was found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 (0.2%), and seven individuals exhibited specific IgG (1.3%). Compared to pre-pandemic times, screen time (e.g., TV, gaming, social media) increased, and the majority of primary school students reported reduced physical activity (42.2%). Fear of infection and risk perception were relatively low, acceptance of adapted health behaviors was high. In this post-lockdown period of low SARS-CoV-2 incidence in Berlin, individual and school-level infection prevention measures were largely adhered to. Nevertheless, vigilance and continued preventive measures are essential to cope with future pandemic activity.","Hommes, Franziska; van Loon, Welmoed; Thielecke, Marlene; Abramovich, Igor; Lieber, Sascha; Hammerich, Ralf; Gehrke-Beck, Sabine; Linzbach, Elisabeth; Schuster, Angela; von dem Busche, Katja; Theuring, Stefanie; Gertler, Maximilian; Martinez, Gabriela Equihua; Richter, Joachim; Bergmann, Clara; Bölke, Alisa; Böhringer, Falko; Mall, Marcus A; Rosen, Alexander; Krannich, Alexander; Keller, Jan; Bethke, Norma; Kurzmann, Marco; Kurth, Tobias; Kirchberger, Valerie; Seybold, Joachim; Mockenhaupt, Frank P; Study Group, Becoss",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),207,24

All consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to our Clinic between March 1, 2020, and May 1, 2020, who were tested at hospital admission for anti-S1RBD and anti-NP IgG were enrolled. Serum samples were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with the use of two commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Results are expressed as optical density measurements at 450 nm (OD450 ). Overall, 111 patients were included; the median (q1-q3) age was 57 (49-73) years, 59 (53%) males.

Objective: To delineate and compare the immunologic features of mild and moderate COVID-19 in pediatric patients. Design, Setting, and Participants: This single-center case series included 157 pediatric patients admitted to Wuhan Children's Hospital with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Data were collected from January 25 to April 18, 2020. Exposures: Documented SARS-CoV-2 infection. Main Outcomes and Measures: Clinical and immunologic characteristics were collected and analyzed. Outcomes were observed until April 18, 2020. Results: Of the 157 pediatric patients with COVID-19, 60 (38.2%) had mild clinical type with pneumonia, 88 (56.1%) had moderate cases, 6 (3.8%) had severe cases, and 3 (1.9%) were critically ill. The 148 children with mild or moderate disease had a median (interquartile range [IQR]) age of 84 (18-123) months, and 88 (59.5%) were girls. The most common laboratory abnormalities were increased levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (median [IQR], 16.0 [12.0-26.0] U/L), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (median [IQR], 30.0 [23.0-41.8] U/L), creatine kinase MB (CK-MB) activity (median [IQR], 24.0 [18.0-34.0] U/L), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (median [IQR], 243.0 [203.0-297.0] U/L), which are associated with liver and myocardial injury. Compared with mild cases, levels of inflammatory cytokines including interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor &#945;, and interferon Î³ were unchanged, whereas the level of immune suppressive interleukin 10 was markedly increased in moderate cases compared with mild cases (median [IQR], 3.96 [3.34-5.29] pg/mL vs 3.58 [3.10-4.36] pg/mL; P = .048). There was no statistically significant difference in absolute number of lymphocytes (including T cells and B cells) between mild and moderate cases, but moderate cases were associated with a decrease in neutrophil levels compared with mild cases (median [IQR], 2310/µL [1680/µL-3510/µL] vs 3120/µL [2040/µL-4170/µL]; P = .01). Immunoglobin G and the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio were negatively associated with biochemical indices related to liver and myocardial injury (immunoglobulin G, ALT: r, -0.3579; AST: r, -0.5280; CK-MB activity: r, -0.4786; LDH: r, -0.4984; and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, ALT: r, -0.1893; AST: r, -0.3912; CK-MB activity: r, -0.3428; LDH: r, -0.3234), while counts of lymphocytes, CD4+ T cells, and interleukin 10 showed positive associations (lymphocytes, ALT: r, 0.2055; AST: r, 0.3615; CK-MB activity: r, 0.338; LDH: r, 0.3309; CD4+ T cells, AST: r, 0.4701; CK-MB activity: r, 0.4151; LDH: r, 0.4418; interleukin 10, ALT: r, 0.2595; AST: r, 0.3386; CK-MB activity: r, 0.3948; LDH: r, 0.3794). Conclusions and Relevance: In this case series, systemic inflammation rarely occurred in pediatric patients with COVID-19, in contrast with the lymphopenia and aggravated inflammatory responses frequently observed in adults with COVID-19. Gaining a deeper understanding of the role of neutrophils, CD4+ T cells, and B cells in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection could be important for the clinical management of COVID-19.","Wu, Huan; Zhu, Hongmin; Yuan, Chunhui; Yao, Cong; Luo, Wei; Shen, Xin; Wang, Jun; Shao, Jianbo; Xiang, Yun",JAMA Netw Open,207,16

This risk can be reduced by the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). However, shortage of PPE has emerged as an important issue in managing the pandemic in both traditionally high and low-resource areas. A group of clinicians and researchers from thirteen countries representing low, middle, and high-income areas has developed recommendations for optimal utilization of PPE before, during, and after gastrointestinal endoscopy with particular reference to low-resource situations. We determined that there is limited flexibility with regard to the utilization of PPE between ideal and low-resource settings. Some compromises are possible, especially with regard to PPE use, during endoscopic procedures. We have, therefore, also stressed the need to prevent transmission of COVID-19 by measures other than PPE and to conserve PPE by reduction of patient volume, limiting procedures to urgent or emergent, and reducing the number of staff and trainees involved in procedures. This guidance aims to optimize utilization of PPE and protection of health care providers.","Leddin, Desmond; Armstrong, David; Raja Ali, Raja A; Barkun, Alan; Butt, Amna S; Chen, Ye; Khara, Harshit S; Lee, Yeong Yeh; Leung, Wai Keung; Macrae, Finlay; Makharia, Govind; Malekzadeh, Reza; Makhoul, Elias; Sadeghi, Anahita; Saurin, Jean-Christophe; Topazian, Mark; Thomson, Sandie R; Veitch, Andrew; Wu, Kaichun",J Clin Gastroenterol,207,16

We hypothesized that timely government implementation of stringent measures to reduce viral transmission would benefit mental health, as evidenced by reduced rates of depressive symptoms (i.e., Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ]-9&#8805;10, PHQ-2&#8805;3). METHODS: The systematic review herein (PROSPERO CRD42020200647) evaluated to what extent differences in government-imposed stringency and timeliness of response to COVID-19 moderate the prevalence of depressive symptoms across 33 countries (k=114, N=640,037). We included data from six lower-middle-income countries, nine upper-middle-income countries, and 18 higher-income countries. Government-imposed stringency and timeliness in response were operationalized using the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response (""Stringency"") Index. RESULTS: The overall proportion of study participants with clinically significant depressive symptoms was 21.39% (95% CI 19.37-23.47). The prevalence of clinically significant depressive symptoms was significantly lower in countries wherein governments implemented stringent policies promptly. The moderating effect of government response remained significant after including the national frequency of COVID cases at the time of study commencement, Healthcare Access and Quality index, and the inclusion of COVID patients in the study. LIMITATIONS: Factors that may have confounded our results include, for example, differences in lockdown duration, lack of study participant and outcome assessor blinding, and retrospective assessment of depressive symptom severity. CONCLUSIONS: Governments that enacted stringent measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 benefited not only the physical, but also the mental health of their population.","Lee, Yena; Lui, Leanna M W; Chen-Li, David; Liao, Yuhua; Mansur, Rodrigo B; Brietzke, Elisa; Rosenblat, Joshua D; Ho, Roger; Rodrigues, Nelson B; Lipsitz, Orly; Nasri, Flora; Cao, Bing; Subramaniapillai, Mehala; Gill, Hartej; Lu, Ciyong; McIntyre, Roger S",J Affect Disord,207,23

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is perceived as a frequent finding in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, but data describing the prevalence of DVT are lacking. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to report the prevalence of DVT in COVID-19 patients in general wards, blinded to symptoms/signs of disease, using lower extremities duplex ultrasound (LEDUS) in random patients. We tested the association of DVT with clinical, laboratory and inflammatory markers and also reported on the secondary endpoint of in-hospital mortality. PATIENTS/METHODS: n = 263 COVID-19 patients were screened with LEDUS between March 01, 2020 and April 05, 2020 out of the overall n = 1012 admitted with COVID-19. RESULTS: DVT was detected in n = 67 screened patients (25.5%), n = 41 patients (15.6%) died during the index hospitalization. Multiple logistic regression demonstrated that only C-reactive protein (odds ratio 1.009, 95% CI 1.004-1.013, p < 0.001) was independently associated with the presence of DVT at LEDUS. Both age (odds ratio 1.101, 95% CI 1.054-1.150, p < 0.001) and C-reactive protein (odds ratio 1.012, 95% CI 1.006-1.018, p < 0.001) were instead significantly independently associated with in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The main study finding is that DVT prevalence in COVID-19 patients admitted to general wards is 25.5%, suggesting it may be reasonable to screen COVID-19 patients for this potentially severe but treatable complication, and that inflammation, measured with serum C-reactive protein, is the main variable associated with the presence of DVT, where all other clinical or laboratory variables, age or D-dimer included, are instead not independently associated with DVT.","Ierardi, Anna Maria; Gaibazzi, Nicola; Tuttolomondo, Domenico; Fusco, Stefano; La Mura, Vincenzo; Peyvandi, Flora; Aliberti, Stefano; Blasi, Francesco; Cozzi, Diletta; Carrafiello, Gianpaolo; De Filippo, Massimo",,207,7

In fact, a review of history of previous natural disasters reveals that this has been normal every time health systems have been overburdened. In the present situation of COVID 19, these students have a crucial role to play in helping frontline workers combat the crisis. Though the students would like to render their services, they are in a state of dilemma, as their roles are not defined clearly and their training to combat the pandemic is inadequate, as it was in previous outbreaks.

Age-related impairments in innate immunity and suboptimal virus-specific T cell and antibody responses are believed to cause severe disease upon respiratory virus infections. This phenomenon has recently received increased attention, as elderly patients are at substantially elevated risk for severe COVID-19 disease and experience increased rates of mortality following SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with younger populations. However, the basis for age-related fatal pneumonia following pathogenic hCoVs is not well understood. In this Review, we provide an overview of our current understanding of hCoV-induced fatal pneumonia in the elderly. We describe host immune response to hCoV infections derived from studies of young and aged animal models and discuss the potential role of age-associated increases in sterile inflammation (inflammaging) and virus-induced dysregulated inflammation in causing age-related severe disease. We also highlight the existing gaps in our knowledge about virus replication and host immune responses to hCoV infection in young and aged individuals.","Channappanavar, Rudragouda; Perlman, Stanley",J Clin Invest,207,20

General guidelines have evolved, but to date, there are no explicit directives about whether and how to proceed. This paper reviews professional, ethical, and legal challenges that experts should consider before conducting such an evaluation remotely. Although the discussion is more widely applicable, remote forensic psychological assessment of adults alleging childhood abuse is used as an example throughout, due to the complexity of these cases, the ethical dilemmas they can present, and the need to carefully assess non-verbal trauma-related symptoms. The use of videoconferencing technology is considered in terms of potential benefits of this medium, as well as challenges this method could pose to aspects of interviewing and psychometric testing. The global pandemic is also considered with respect to its effects on functioning and mental health and the confounding impact such a crisis has on assessing the relationship between childhood abuse and current psychological functioning. Finally, for those evaluators who want to engage in remote assessment, practice considerations are discussed.","Goldenson, Julie; Josefowitz, Nina",Psychol Inj Law,207,16

An online anonymous questionnaire was developed in Chinese, including the individual background information, the perception of the epidemic, and level of anxiety and depression through Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10). The respondents were divided into ORTHO group, TMD group and Control group. Descriptive analysis and multiple linear regression modelling were performed. In total, 1241 valid questionnaires were collected, covering 587 orthodontic patients and 220 TMD patients. It is shown that the overall mental health is not quite optimistic during the COVID-19 pandemic with the mean score of K10 being 18.65. TMD patients have higher level of anxiety and depression than orthodontic patients as well as the general population. Younger age, female gender, having close contact with individuals from Hubei province, higher self-rated infection possibility, concern about psychological barriers and distrust are negatively affecting patients' psychological status.

On the basis of this issue, neurologists are very concerned about patients with neurological disorders, especially multiple sclerosis (MS), as consumers of immunosuppressive or immune-modulating drugs. Therefore, the administration of proper disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) in MS patients is critical during the pandemic status. On the one hand, both the autoimmune diseases and immunosuppressive drugs increase the risk of infection due to impairment in the immune system, and on the other hand, postponing of MS treatment has serious consequences on the central nervous system. In the present study, we discussed recent literature about the effect of DMTs administration on the severity of COVID-19 in the MS patients. Overall, it seems that DMTs do not provoke the COVID-19 infection in the MS patients by declining immune responses and cytokine storm.

As the COVID-19 pandemic has spread across the globe wreaking unprecedented disruption, increasing levels of xenophobia and racial discrimination have been documented against those of Asian descent. We investigate the historical connections between disease and rise of xenophobia as described in the peer-reviewed literature addressing prior epidemics, such as Ebola and the Hong Kong Flu, in conjunction with concurrent cases of prejudice toward certain groups of people. Attempts to better understand why such attitudes emerge are examined in the context of xenophobic actions during pandemics. Prevailing views suggest that xenophobia ultimately leads to increased stigmatization of those afflicted by disease, which in turn leads to decreased trust in the medical system, resulting in a negative feedback loop. Accurate disseminated information and improved public education on sources and modes of transmission of infectious diseases are essential to check xenophobic tendencies, reduce negative effects and foster greater cooperation.","Chang, Crystal; Salerno, Anthony; Hsu, Edbert B",J Emerg Manag,207,30

This research is an effort to identify the major predictors that have a significant impact on the number of COVID-19 cases per million population for 83 countries. The findings highlight that a population with a greater share of old people (aged above 65) shows a higher number of COVID-19 positive cases and a population with a lower median age has fewer cases. This can be explained in terms of higher co-morbidities and the lower general immunity in the older age group. The analysis restates the widely seen results that a higher median age and greater prevalence of co-morbidities leads to higher cases per million and lesser population density and interpersonal contact helps in containing the spread of the virus. The study finds foundation in the assertion that a higher temperature might lower the number of cases, or that temperature in general can affect the infectivity. The study suggests that better access to sanitation is a certain measure to contain the spread of the virus. The outcome of this study will be helpful in ascertaining the impact of these indicators in this pandemic, and help in policy formation and decision-making strategies to fight against it.","Singh, Pawan Kumar; Kiran, Ravi; Bhatt, Rajiv Kumar; Tabash, Mosab I; Pandey, Alok Kumar; Chouhan, Anushka",J Public Aff,207,33

The software was used in a multi-specialty, multi-instructor medicine and surgery course in the third year of a veterinary curriculum. In addition to standard multiple-choice and short-answer questions, Top Hat has several unique question types and methods of displaying the responses given. These include displaying free-text responses in a word cloud format and a ""click-on-target"" question type that allows students to indicate their response by clicking on a location within an image. Responses for this latter question type are displayed in a heat map format. A discussion tool is also available, which allows students to respond, read other students' responses in real time, and then reply again if warranted. This feature also supports drawing-based responses. The variety of question types was very useful in keeping students engaged during teaching sessions, giving this application several advantages over systems that are limited to multiple-choice questions only. In addition, the application allowed rapid identification of areas of student knowledge and misunderstandings, which facilitated the direction of further discussion and clarification of important learning issues.","Mariani, Christopher L; Roe, Simon C",J Vet Med Educ,207,14

Patients and Methods: A database of 109 consecutive patients who underwent total thyroidectomy and therapeutic lateral neck dissection followed by remnant ablation for PTC between January 1989 and December 2014 was reviewed We recorded the patients' all serum Tg and TgAb levels over time to establish changing trends. Patients were classified as either positive or negative according to serum TgAb levels. The recurrence or persistence rates in both groups were compared. Results: Of the 109 patients enrolled 14 patients had TgAb positivity. Thirty-two (29.3%) showed disease recurrence or persistent disease during 101 months of follow-up. Twenty-seven of 95 patients (28.4%) with negative TgAb had persistent or recurrent disease, whereas 5 of 14 patients (35.7%) with positive TgAb had persistence or recurrence (P = 0.57). No significant difference in disease-free survival (115.3 ± 10.8 vs. 224.1 ± 16.6 months, P = 0.78) and overall survival (P = 0.59) was observed between TgAb positive and TgAb negative patients.

National lockdown measures are believed to dramatically have limited the spread of the virus globally, but on the other side, may have had several unknown negative side effects on the planned and acute care for vulnerable groups. In this study, we aimed to assess the effects of COVID-19 pandemic lockdown restrictions on the number of emergency and elective hip joint surgeries due to fractures and osteoarthritis (OA), respectively, and explore whether these procedures are more/less affected by lockdown restrictions than other hospital care. Methods: In 1.344.355 persons aged ≥35 years in the Norwegian emergency preparedness (BEREDT C19) register, we studied the daily number of persons having 1) electively planned surgeries due to hip OA, and 2) emergency surgeries due to hip fractures before and after COVID-19 lockdown restrictions were implemented nationally on March 13th 2020, for different age and sex groups. We also studied the daily number of all-cause elective- and all-cause emergency hospitalizations (&gt;24 hours). For all our outcomes, we categorized dates in five 2-weeks periods before lockdown (March 13th 2020), and five 2-weeks periods after lockdown, covering a total time period from January 3rd 2020 to May 21st 2020. To observe trends in number of events over time, we compared the incidence rate ratios (IRR) for all the 2-week periods with the base level, which was defined as the two first weeks of January. We also compared IRR in the 10 weeks before and after lockdown restrictions were implemented, using the entire period of 10 weeks before lockdown as base level (Jan 3rd-March 12th). The IRRs reflect the after-lockdown number of events divided by the before-lockdown number events. Results: The IRRs for all the 2-weeks periods, for elective and emergency hip surgeries are presented in the Figure, indicating a large and consistent decrease in hip OA surgeries and a smaller but more age- and sex-dependent decrease in hip fracture surgeries. More specifically, for the two 10-weeks periods before and after lockdown, we observed that the number of after-lockdown elective hip surgeries due to OA were one third of the number of before-lockdown elective hip surgeries due to OA, and the drop was similar for men and women above and below 70 years (IRR ∼0.3). This drop for hip OA surgeries was greater than the drop seen for all-cause elective hospital care (IRR ∼0.6, 95% CI=0.6-0.6). In contrast, the number of emergency hip fracture surgeries had a drop of a similar magnitude as that observed for all-cause emergency care (IRR=0.8, 95% CI=0.8-0.8). However, there were age and sex differences in the magnitude of the drop. Men aged 35-69 had close to half the number of surgeries (IRR ∼0.6, 95% CI=0.6-0.6), whereas women aged ≥70 had the same number of emergency hip fracture surgeries after lockdown (IRR ∼1, 95% CI = 1-1). Only women aged 35-69 and men aged ≥70 had emergency hip fracture surgery rates after lockdown comparable to what may be expected based on analyses of all-cause acute care (IRR ∼0.8, 95% CI=0.8-0.8). Conclusions: We report a sudden and steep decrease in the daily number of planned hip joint surgeries due to OA, beginning on the day after lockdown restrictions were implemented in Norway on March 13th 2020. This decrease was greater than the decrease in other (all-cause) elective inpatient care for all age and sex groups. Interestingly, we also report a consistent decrease of all-cause emergency inpatient care that only partly was found in age- and sex-specific analyses of emergency hip joint fracture surgeries. We believe these findings are important to report for an improved knowledge foundation allowing for an optimal management of future pandemics of a similar or larger scale.

Our objective was to evaluate host endothelial, epithelial and inflammatory biomarkers in COVID-19. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 171 ICU patients, including 78 (46%) patients positive and 93 (54%) negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection from April to September, 2020. We compared 22 plasma biomarkers in blood collected within 24 h and 3 days after ICU admission. RESULTS: In critically ill COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients, the most common ICU admission diagnoses were respiratory failure or pneumonia, followed by sepsis and other diagnoses. Similar proportions of patients in both groups received invasive mechanical ventilation at the time of study enrollment. COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients had similar rates of acute respiratory distress syndrome, severe acute kidney injury, and in-hospital mortality. While concentrations of interleukin 6 and 8 were not different between groups, markers of epithelial cell injury (soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products, sRAGE) and acute phase proteins (serum amyloid A, SAA) were significantly higher in COVID-19 compared to non-COVID-19, adjusting for demographics and APACHE III scores. In contrast, angiopoietin 2:1 (Ang-2:1 ratio) and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (sTNFR-1), markers of endothelial dysfunction and inflammation, were significantly lower in COVID-19 (p < 0.002). Ang-2:1 ratio and SAA were associated with mortality only in non-COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: These studies demonstrate that, unlike other well-studied causes of critical illness, endothelial dysfunction may not be characteristic of severe COVID-19 early after ICU admission. Pathways resulting in elaboration of acute phase proteins and inducing epithelial cell injury may be promising targets for therapeutics in COVID-19.","Bhatraju, Pavan K; Morrell, Eric D; Zelnick, Leila; Sathe, Neha A; Chai, Xin-Ya; Sakr, Sana S; Sahi, Sharon K; Sader, Anthony; Lum, Dawn M; Liu, Ted; Koetje, Neall; Garay, Ashley; Barnes, Elizabeth; Lawson, Jonathan; Cromer, Gail; Bray, Mary K; Pipavath, Sudhakar; Kestenbaum, Bryan R; Liles, W Conrad; Fink, Susan L; West, T Eoin; Evans, Laura; Mikacenic, Carmen; Wurfel, Mark M",Crit Care,207,16

The aim of our study was to investigate a potential temporal association between measures against COVID-19 in February-April 2020 and incidence of other infectious diseases reported to MSIS. MATERIAL AND METHOD: We compared the number of disease cases reported to MSIS during weeks 6-14 in 2020 with the median of cases reported in corresponding weeks during three previous years (2017-2019). RESULTS: Compared to the median of cases reported during corresponding weeks in three previous years, physicians and laboratories reported 47 % fewer cases (159 vs. 301) in week 12, 50 % fewer cases (131 vs. 261) in week 13, and 69 % fewer cases (77 vs. 252) in week 14. There was a reduction in the number of notifications of all included disease groups. INTERPRETATION: The observed decline in reporting of diseases other than COVID-19 may indicate a reduced risk of communicable diseases due to comprehensive advice and the requirement for social distancing. However, it is also possible that the sensitivity of the surveillance system was affected by increased resource use on COVID-19 cases management.","Stefanoff, Pawel; Løvlie, Astrid Louise; Elstrøm, Petter; Macdonald, Emily Ann",Tidsskr. nor. laegeforen.,207,7

The Zika virus (ZIKV) illustrated this, as there was limited information and awareness of the virus when it was identified as a public health emergency in February 2016. Predicting which virus may pose a future threat is difficult. This is in part because significant knowledge gaps in the basic biology and ecology of an emerging virus can impede policy development, delay decision making, and hinder public health action. We suggest using a phylogenetic framework of pathogens and their infected host species for insight into which animals may serve as reservoirs. For example, examining flaviviruses closely related to ZIKV, the phylogenetic framework indicates New World monkeys are the most likely candidates to be potential reservoirs for ZIKV. Secondarily, mammals that are in close proximity to humans should be considered because of the increased opportunity for pathogen exchange. The increase in human-mediated environmental change is accelerating the probability of another previously overlooked virus becoming a significant concern. By investing in basic science research and organizing our knowledge into an evolutionary framework, we will be better prepared to respond to the next emerging infectious disease.

Low moisture content in cabins is known to be responsible for headache, tiredness and many other non-specific symptoms. In addition, current widely used air distribution systems on airplanes dilute internally generated pollutants by promoting air mixing and thus impose risks of infectious airborne disease transmission. To boost air humidity level while simultaneously restricting air mixing, this investigation uses a validated computational fluid dynamics (CFD) program to design a new under-aisle air distribution system for wide-body aircraft cabins. The new system supplies fully outside, dry air at low momentum through a narrow channel passage along both side cabin walls to middle height of the cabin just beneath the stowage bins, while simultaneously humidified air is supplied through both perforated under aisles. By comparing with the current mixing air distribution system in terms of distribution of relative humidity, CO(2) concentration, velocity, temperature and draught risk, the new system is found being able to improve the relative humidity from the existent 10% to the new level of 20% and lessen the inhaled CO(2) concentration by 30%, without causing moisture condensation on cabin interior and inducing draught risks for passengers. The water consumption rate in air humidification is only around 0.05 kg/h per person, which should be affordable by airliners.","Zhang, Tengfei (Tim); Yin, Shi; Wang, Shugang",Build Environ,207,16

The electrospun nanofibers (NFs) were carbonized and physically activated to obtain activated carbon nanofibers (ACNFs). Texture, surface and elemental properties of the pristine ACNFs and composites were characterized using various techniques. In comparison to pristine ACNF, the incorporation of rGO led to changes in surface and textural characteristics such as specific surface area (S(BET)), total pore volume (V(total)), and micropore volume (V(micro)) of 373 m(2)/g, 0.22 cm(3)/g, and 0.15 cm(3)/g, respectively, which is much higher than the pristine ACNFs (e.g., S(BET) = 139 m(2)/g). The structural and morphological properties of the pristine ACNFs and their composites were studied by Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD), and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) respectively. Carbon dioxide (CO(2)) adsorption on the pristine ACNFs and rGO/ACNF composites was evaluated at different pressures (5, 10, and 15 bars) based on static volumetric adsorption. At 15 bar, the composite with 10% of rGO (rGO/ACNF0.1) that had the highest S(BET), V(total), and V(micro), as confirmed with BET model, exhibited the highest CO(2) uptake of 58 mmol/g. These results point out that both surface and texture have a strong influence on the performance of CO(2) adsorption. Interestingly, at p < 10 bar, the adsorption process of CO(2) was found to be quite well fitted by pseudo-second order model (i.e., the chemisorption), whilst at 15 bar, physisorption prevailed, which was explained by the pseudo-first order model.","Che Othman, Faten Ermala; Yusof, Norhaniza; González-Benito, Javier; Fan, Xiaolei; Ismail, Ahmad Fauzi",Polymers (Basel),207,24

Treating heart failure necessitates prescribing of multiple medications, in-line with national and international guidelines predisposing patients to polypharmacy. This review aims to identify how polypharmacy has been defined among heart failure patients in the literature, whether a standard definition in relation to heart failure could be identified and to describe the prevalence. The Healthcare Database Advanced Search (HDAS) was used to search EMBASE, MEDLINE, PubMed, Cinahl and PsychInfo from inception until March 2021. Articles were included of any design, in patients ≥ 18 years old, with a diagnosis of heart failure; that explicitly define and measure polypharmacy. Data were thereafter extracted and described using a narrative synthesis approach. A total of 7522 articles were identified with 22 meeting the inclusion criteria. No standard definition of polypharmacy was identified. The most common definition was that of “ ≥ 5 medications.” Polypharmacy prevalence was high in heart failure populations, ranging from 17.2 to 99%. Missing or heterogeneous methods for defining heart failure and poor patient cohort characterisation limited the impact of most studies. Polypharmacy, most commonly defined as ≥ 5 medications, is highly prevalent in the heart failure population. There is a need for an internationally agreed definition of polypharmacy, allowing accurate review of polypharmacy issues. Whether an arbitrary numerical cut-off is a suitable definition, rather than medication appropriateness, remains unclear. Further studies are necessary to understand the relationship between polypharmacy with specific types of heart failure and related comorbidities.

Our aim was to establish reference ranges for healthy Chinese children. METHODS: Ciliated epithelial samples were obtained from 135 healthy Chinese children aged below 18 years by brushing the inferior nasal turbinate. CBF and beat pattern were analysed from high speed video recordings. Epithelial integrity and ciliary ultrastructure were assessed using transmission electronic microscopy. RESULTS: The mean CBF from 135 children studied was 10.1 Hz (95% CI 9.8 to 10.4). Approximately 20% (ranged 18.0–24.2%) of ciliated epithelial edges were found to have areas of dyskinetically beating cilia. Normal beat pattern was observed in ciliated epithelium from all subjects. We did not find any effect of exposure to second hand smoke on CBF in our subjects. Microtubular defects were found in 9.3% of all of the cilia counted in these children, while other ciliary ultrastructural defects were found in less than 3%.

As with the other members in the group 1, theses viruses are also known to use the host aminopeptidase N (APN) as the major receptor for cell entry. Remarkably, it was found that they utilize distinct cultured cell lines for in vitro virus propagation, since PEDV could not be replicated in swine testis (ST) cells expressing native porcine APN (pAPN), which are highly susceptible to TGEV. To explain the mechanism causing this discrimination, we postulated that there may be a correlation between the pAPN expression level and PEDV infection. As a first step toward understanding the role of cellular receptor density in PEDV replication, therefore, sub-lines of ST cells stably overexpressing recombinant pAPN were generated. We initially confirmed that the control ST cells do express relatively low levels of endogenous pAPN. In contrast, in the engineered stable cell lines, a high level of recombinant pAPN expression was demonstrated. The introduction of a pAPN gene into nonpermissive ST cells was further found to be fully sufficient to support productive infection, revealing that constitutive overexpression of pAPN can directly rescue PEDV multiplication. We further assessed whether the pAPN enzymatic function is relevant to PEDV infection. The enzymatic active motif-null mutant pAPN still retained the ability to exert its receptor activity and consequently, to cause infectious virus production. Moreover, the only APN inhibitor blocking the protease activity site had no obvious negative effect on viral infection, indicating that the enzymatic role of APN is dispensable for the process of virus replication. Taken together, our results suggest that pAPN receptor density appears to be an important factor in contributing to efficient PEDV infection.","Nam, Eeuri; Lee, Changhee",Vet Microbiol,207,20

Active surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 can aid in early detection of outbreaks, but the testing frequency required to identify an outbreak at its earliest stage is unknown. We assess what testing frequency is required to detect an outbreak before there are 10 detectable infections. Methods: A dynamic compartmental transmission model of SARS-CoV-2 was developed to simulate spread among a university community. After introducing a single infection into a fully susceptible population, we calculate the probability of detecting at least one case on each succeeding day with various NAT testing frequencies (daily testing achieving 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of the population tested per month) assuming an 85% test sensitivity. A proportion of infected individuals (varied from 1-60%) are assumed to present to health services (HS) for symptomatic testing. We ascertain the expected number of detectable infections in the community when there is a >90% probability of detecting at least 1 case. Sensitivity analyses examine impact of transmission rates (Rt=0=2, 2.5,3), presentation to HS (1%/5%/30%/60%), and pre-existing immunity (0%/10%) Results: Assuming an 85% test sensitivity, identifying an outbreak with 90% probability when the expected number of detectable infections is 9 or fewer requires NAT testing of 100% of the population per month; this result holds for all transmission rates and all levels of presentation at health services we considered. . If 1% of infected people present at HS and Rt=0=3, testing 75%/50%/25% per month could identify an outbreak when the expected numbers of detectable infections are 12/17/30 respectively; these numbers decline to 9/11/12 if 30% of infected people present at HS . As proportion of infected individuals present at health services increases, the marginal impact of active surveillance is reduced. Higher transmission rates result in shorter time to detection but also rapidly escalating cases without intervention. Little differences were observed with 10% pre-existing immunity. Conclusions: Widespread testing of 100% of the campus population every month is required to detect an outbreak when there are fewer than 9 detectable infections for the scenarios examined, but high presentation of symptomatic people at HS can compensate in part for lower levels of testing. Early detection is necessary, but not sufficient, to curtail disease outbreaks; the proposed testing rates would need to be accompanied by case isolation, contact tracing, quarantine, and other risk mitigation and social distancing interventions.","Martin, N.; Schooley, R.

In order to design new attenuated vaccines, to decrease virulence of virus wild types, it is important to understand what allows a virus to hijack its host cell's metabolism, a property of all viruses. RNA and protein sequences obtained from databases were used to count the number of atoms of each element in the virions of SARS, MERS and SARS-CoV-2. The number of protein copies and carbohydrate composition were taken from the literature. The number of lipid molecules was estimated from the envelope surface area. Based on elemental composition, growth equations were balanced, and thermodynamic properties of the viruses were determined using Patel-Erickson and Battley equations. Elemental and molecular compositions of SARS, MERS and SARS-CoV-2 were found, as well as their standard thermodynamic properties of formation and growth. Standard Gibbs energy of growth of virus nucleocapsids was found to be significantly more negative than that of their host tissue. The ratio of Gibbs energies of growth of virus nucleocapsids and host cell is greater than unity. The more negative Gibbs energy of growth of viruses implies that virus multiplication has a greater driving force than synthesis of host cell components, giving a physical explanation of why viruses are able to hijack their host cell's metabolism. Knowing the mechanism of viral metabolism hijacking can open new paths for vaccine design. By manipulating chemical composition of viruses, virulence can be decreased by making the Gibbs energy of their growth less negative, resulting in decreased multiplication rate, while preserving antigenic properties.","Popovic, Marko; Minceva, Mirjana",Heliyon,207,29

The results have shown that out of eight selected climatic variables, six variables, viz. maximum temperature, minimum temperature, mean temperature, relative humidity, evaporation, and wind speed are positively associated with coronavirus disease cases (statistically significant at 95 and 99% confidence levels). No association of coronavirus disease has been found with bright sunshine hours and rainfall. Besides, COVID-19 cases and deaths have shown increasing trends, significant at 99% confidence level. The results of this study suggest that climatic conditions in NCT of Delhi are favorable for COVID-19 and the disease may spread further with the increasing temperature, relative humidity, evaporation and wind speed. This is the only study which has presented the analysis of COVID-19 spread in relation to several climatic variables for the most densely populated and rapidly growing city of India. Thus, considering the results obtained, effective policies and actions are necessary especially by identifying the areas where the spread rate is increasing rapidly in this megacity. The prevention and protection measures should be adopted aiming at to reduce the further transmission of disease in the city.","Singh, Omvir; Bhardwaj, Pankaj; Kumar, Dinesh",Environ Dev Sustain,207,16

Key informants were asked about the community’s experiences with COVID-19 testing and treatment, responses to CDC (Centers for Disease Control) guidelines, perceptions about the virus, and the pandemic’s impact on physical and mental health. Results suggest that COVID-19 has profoundly impacted Brazilian immigrants’ mental and physical health. Key informants perceived that community members faced higher risk of COVID-19 infection due to overcrowded living conditions and over-representation in public-facing and informal (e.g., housecleaning) jobs. They reported barriers to COVID-19-related healthcare services including language, immigration status, and fear of deportation. Brazilian cultural norms surrounding hygiene practices, social distancing, and information distribution have shaped the community’s pandemic response. The Brazilian community has faced extensive social, economic, and health ramifications due to the pandemic. While not unique to this community, pre-existing concerns about social disadvantage suggest a particular vulnerability of this population to the virus.","Priebe Rocha, Leticia; Rose, Rebecca; Hoch, Annmarie; Soares, Cristiane; Fernandes, Adriana; Galvão, Heloisa; Allen, Jennifer D.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,207,1

Ultimately, the public’s response to announcements of lockdowns—defined as restrictions on both local movement or long distance travel—will determine how effective these kinds of interventions are. Here, we evaluate the effects of lockdowns on human mobility and simulate how these changes may affect epidemic spread by analyzing aggregated mobility data from mobile phones. We show that in 2020 following lockdown announcements but prior to their implementation, both local and long distance movement increased in multiple locations, and urban-to-rural migration was observed around the world. To examine how these behavioral responses to lockdown policies may contribute to epidemic spread, we developed a simple agent-based spatial model. Our model shows that this increased movement has the potential to increase seeding of the epidemic in less urban areas, which could undermine the goal of the lockdown in preventing disease spread. Lockdowns play a key role in reducing contacts and controlling outbreaks, but appropriate messaging surrounding their announcement and careful evaluation of changes in mobility are needed to mitigate the possible unintended consequences.","Kishore, Nishant; Kahn, Rebecca; Martinez, Pamela P.; De Salazar, Pablo M.; Mahmud, Ayesha S.; Buckee, Caroline O.",Sci Rep,207,16

As little is known about the role of viruses in children with PTB, we investigated the prevalence of respiratory viruses in children with suspected PTB at presentation and follow-up. METHODS: In an observational cohort study, children < 13 years were routinely investigated for suspected PTB in Cape Town, South Africa between December 2015 and September 2017 and followed up for 24 weeks. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were tested for respiratory viruses using multiplex PCR at enrolment, week 4 and 8. RESULTS: Seventy-three children were enrolled [median age 22.0 months; (interquartile range 10.0–48.0); 56.2% male and 17.8% HIV-infected. Anti-tuberculosis treatment was initiated in 54.8%; of these 50.0% had bacteriologically confirmed TB. At enrolment, ≥1 virus were detected in 95.9% (70/73) children; most commonly human rhinovirus (HRV) (74.0%). HRV was more frequently detected in TB cases (85%) compared to ill controls (60.6%) (p = 0.02). Multiple viruses were detected in 71.2% of all children; 80% of TB cases and 60.6% of ill controls (p = 0.07). At follow-up, ≥1 respiratory virus was detected in 92.2% (47/51) at week 4, and 94.2% (49/52) at week 8. CONCLUSIONS: We found a high prevalence of viral respiratory co-infections in children investigated for PTB, irrespective of final PTB diagnosis, which remained high during follow up. Future work should include investigating the whole respiratory ecosystem in combination with pathogen- specific immune responses.","van der Zalm, M.

In this mini-review, we analyze the main structural similarities of ORF8 with immunological molecules such as IL−1, contributing to the immunological deregulation observed in COVID-19. We also propose that the blockage of some effector functions of ORF8 with Rapamycin, such as the mTORC1 activation through MAPKs 40 pathway, with Rapamycin, can be a promising approach to reduce COVID-19 mortality.","Valcarcel, Antonio; Bensussen, Antonio; Álvarez-Buylla, Elena R.; Díaz, José",Front Genet,207,16

Military treatment facilities serve unique patients that have a service connection; thus, research and data on this population are relatively sparse. The purpose of this study was to provide descriptive data on characteristics and outcomes of MTF patients with COVID-19 who are treated with heated high-flow nasal cannula (HHFNC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a single-center retrospective cohort study at the Wright-Patterson Medical Center, a 52-bed hospital in an urban setting. We received approval from our Institutional Review Board. The cohort included patients admitted from June 1, 2020, through May 15, 2021 with severe or life-threatening COVID-19 from a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome–related coronavirus 2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test who were placed on HHFNC during their hospital stay. Severe disease was defined as dyspnea, respiratory rate ≥30/min, blood oxygen saturation ≤93% without supplemental oxygen, partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio <300, or lung infiltrates involving >50% of lung fields within 24-48 hours. Life-threatening disease was defined as having septic shock or multiple organ dysfunction or requiring intubation. Patients meeting these criteria were retrieved from a quality improvement cohort that represents a consecutive group of patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Wright-Patterson Medical Center. RESULTS: Our MTF managed 70 cases of severe or life-threatening COVID-19 from June 1, 2020, to May 15, 2021. Of the 70 cases, 19 (27%) were placed on HHFNC. After initiation of HHFNC, median SpO(2)/FiO(2) was 281.8 and at 24 hours 145.4. Median respiratory rate oxygenation at these times were 10.7 and 9.4, respectively. Fifty percent required mechanical ventilation during hospitalization. Median intensive care unit length of stay was 11 days, with a maximum stay of 39 days. Median hospital length of stay was 12 days, with a maximum of 39 days. CONCLUSION: Our retrospective cohort study characterized and analyzed outcomes observed in a MTF population, with severe or life-threatening COVID-19, who were treated with HHFNC. While the study did not have the power to make concrete conclusions on the optimal form of respiratory support for COVID-19 patients, our data support HHFNC as a reasonable treatment modality despite some notable differences between our cohort and prior studied patient populations.","Dollin, Capt Yonatan P; Elliott, Capt Brian P; Markert, Ronald; Koroscil, Maj Matthew T",Mil Med,207,9

This variant, unlike ERAP2-wt, is unable to trim peptides to be loaded on MHC class I molecules, but it can still dimerize with both ERAP2-wt and ERAP1-wt, thus contributing to profiling an alternative cellular immune-peptidome. In order to verify if the expression of ERAP2/Iso3 may be induced by other pathogens, PBMCs and MDMs isolated from 20 healthy subjects were stimulated with flu, LPS, CMV, HIV-AT-2, SARS-CoV-2 antigens to analyze its mRNA and protein expression. In parallel, Calu3 cell lines and PBMCs were in vitro infected with growing doses of SARS-CoV-2 (0.5, 5, 1000 MOI) and HIV-1(BAL) (0.1, 1, and 10 ng p24 HIV-1(Bal)/1 × 10(6) PBMCs) viruses, respectively. Results showed that: (1) ERAP2/Iso3 mRNA expression can be prompted by many pathogens and it is coupled with the modulation of several determinants (cytokines, interferon-stimulated genes, activation/inhibition markers, antigen-presentation elements) orchestrating the anti-microbial immune response (Quantigene); (2) ERAP2/Iso3 mRNA is translated into a protein (western blot); (3) ERAP2/Iso3 mRNA expression is sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1 concentration. Considering the key role played by ERAPs in antigen processing and presentation, it is conceivable that these enzymes may be potential targets and modulators of the pathogenicity of infectious diseases and further analyses are needed to define the role played by the different isoforms.","Saulle, Irma; Vanetti, Claudia; Goglia, Sara; Vicentini, Chiara; Tombetti, Enrico; Garziano, Micaela; Clerici, Mario; Biasin, Mara",Cells,207,16

Résultats En 2020, 4,352 signalements (SIN) de Covid-19 nosocomiales ont été émis. Parmi ces SIN, 1845 cas groupés (CG) représentant 18 778 cas patients (60%), 12 574 cas soignants (40 %) et 10 cas visiteurs. La répartition par service des CG signalés est la suivante : 828 en médecine, 567 en SSR, 139 en chirurgie, 108 en SLD, 61 en secteur EHPAD, 42 en soins intensifs, 35 aux urgences, 13 en gynécologie-obstétrique, 3 en imagerie et 48 dans les services supports (laboratoire, cuisine, …). La part des professionnels dans les CG est variable selon les services: elle est proche de la moyenne dans les services de médecine (46 %) et de chirurgie (53 %), elle est plus faible dans les services de SSR (34 %), SLD (27 %) et secteur EHPAD (26 %) et plus élevée en Gynécologie-Obstétrique (63%), en Soins Intensifs (74 %), aux urgences (92 %) et en Imagerie (100 %). Les principales hypothèses formulées pour expliquer la transmission du virus sont: (1) la découverte fortuite d’un cas, (2) le non-respect strict des mesures barrières et (3) les pauses/transmissions entre professionnels sur leur lieu de travail. La première hypothèse est au premier plan dans les services de médecine (38 %) et de chirurgie (44 %), secteur EHPAD (46 %), SLD (41 %) et SSR (42 %). La 3e hypothèse est au premier plan dans les services de gynécologie-obstétrique (62 %), imagerie (100 %) et urgences (43 %). En soins intensifs les 3 hypothèses sont au même niveau (environ 1/3).

Conclusion La transmission nosocomiale de Covid-19 est une réalité à prendre en compte pour maîtriser la diffusion du virus. Elle prend des aspects différents selon les services. Les patients représentent la plus grande part des cas, souvent parce que le cas index n’est pas identifié à l’admission. Ce constat incite à renforcer les précautions standard, le dépistage et les mesures barrières spécifiques dès l’identification des cas. Une part importante des cas groupés implique des professionnels souvent contaminés lors des pauses ou transmission pendant lesquelles le strict respect des mesures barrières doit être maintenu.","Toulemonde, P.; Poujol, I.; Soing-Altrach, S.; Léon, A.; Berger-Carbonne, A.",Infectious Diseases Now,207,32

In response, international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) and United Nations (UN) agencies have mobilized to address the food security needs among different populations. The objective of this review was to identify and describe food security interventions implemented by INGOs and UN agencies during the early stages of the pandemic. Using a rapid review methodology, we reviewed food security interventions implemented by five INGOs and three UN agencies between 31 December 2019 and 31 May 2020. Descriptive statistical and content analyses were used to explore the extent, range, and nature of these interventions. In total, 416 interventions were identified across 107 low- and middle-income countries. Non-state actors have developed new interventions to directly respond to the food security needs created by the pandemic. In addition, these humanitarian organizations have adapted (e.g., new public health protocols, use of technology) and reframed existing initiatives to position their efforts in the context of the pandemic. These findings provide a useful baseline to monitor how non-state actors, in addition to the food security interventions these organizations implement, continue to be influenced by the pandemic. In addition, these findings provide insights into the different ways in which INGOs and UN agencies mobilized resources during the early and uncertain stages of the pandemic.","Dodd, Warren; Kipp, Amy; Bustos, Monica; McNeil, Aliya; Little, Matthew; Lau, Lincoln Leehang",Nutrients,207,1

Accordingly, the current study examined how vaccine hesitancy contributes to clinical levels of depression, anxiety, and peritraumatic stress among individuals who had received COVID-19 vaccinations. METHODS: We analyzed data obtained from 254 vaccinated individuals, and assessed vaccine hesitancy, depression, anxiety, and peritraumatic distress, as well as several demographic, health, and COVID-19-related factors. RESULTS: Logistic regressions demonstrated that above and beyond socio-demographic, health, and COVID-19-related factors, COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was the most prominent risk factor for anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic distress. Higher levels of vaccine hesitancy were found to double the risk for depression and peritraumatic stress (ORs > 2), and to triple the risk for anxiety (OR > 3). LIMITATIONS: A cross-sectional design; a preliminary study requiring further investigation CONCLUSIONS: This study points to the importance of vaccine hesitancy among vaccinated populations and provides knowledge regarding its associations with negative psychiatric outcomes. These findings may offer important information for healthcare practitioners and policy makers in their attempt to encourage individuals to receive COVID-19 vaccinations and emphasize the need to further understand the underlying mechanisms of psychiatric morbidity among vaccinated individuals.","Palgi, Yuval; Bergman, Yoav S.; Ben-David, Boaz; Bodner, Ehud",J Affect Disord,207,1

Methods: We collected daily cumulative incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Georgia. We estimated the reproductive number (Re) of the COVID-19 epidemic on April 18 and May 2 by characterizing the initial growth phase of the epidemic using the generalized-growth model. Results: The data presents a sub-exponential growth pattern in the cumulative incidence curves. On April 18, 2020, Re was estimated as 1.20 (95% CI: 1.10, 1.20) for the state of Georgia, 1.10 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.20) for Dougherty County, and 1.20 (95% CI: 1.10, 1.20) for Metro Atlanta.

METHODS: Observational, clinical and database review of athletes with symptomatic COVID-19 illness managed within the UK Sports Institutes. Athletes were classified as confirmed (positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR or antibody tests) or probable (consistent clinical features) COVID-19. Clinical presentation was characterised by the predominant symptom focus (eg, upper or lower respiratory illness). Time loss was defined as days unavailable for full sport participation and comparison was made with a 2016–2019 respiratory illness dataset from the same surveillance system. RESULTS: Between 24 February 2020 and 18 January 2021, 147 athletes (25 Paralympic (17%)) with mean (SD) age 24.7 (5.2) years, 37% female, were diagnosed with COVID-19 (76 probable, 71 confirmed). Fatigue was the most prevalent symptom (57%), followed by dry cough (50%) and headache (46%). The median (IQR) symptom duration was 10 (6–17) days but 14% reported symptoms >28 days. Median time loss was 18 (12–30) days, with 27% not fully available >28 days from initial date of infection. This was greater than our historical non-COVID respiratory illness comparator; 6 days, 0–7 days (p<0.001) and 4% unavailable at 28 days. A lower respiratory phenotype (ie, including dyspnoea±chest pain±cough±fever) was present in 18% and associated with a higher relative risk of prolonged symptoms risk ratio 3.0 (95% CI: 1.4 to 6.5) and time loss 2.1 (95% CI: 1.2 to 3.5). CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort, COVID-19 largely resulted in a mild, self-limiting illness. The presence of lower respiratory tract features was associated with prolonged illness and a delayed return to sport.","Hull, James H; Wootten, Moses; Moghal, Moiz; Heron, Neil; Martin, Rhodri; Walsted, Emil S; Biswas, Anita; Loosemore, Mike; Elliott, Niall; Ranson, Craig",Br J Sports Med,207,26

To check appropriateness of the antigen based testing, we determined sensitivity of two point-of-care antigen tests when applied to a cohort of COVID-19 symptomatic, COVID-19 asymptomatic and healthy persons. Methods: We examined nasopharyngeal swabs with antigen test 1 (Panbio Covid-19 Ag Rapid Test, Abbott) and antigen test 2 (Standard F Covid-19 Ag FIA, SD Biosensor). An additional nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab of the same individual was checked with PCR (Allplex SARS-nCoV-2, Seegene). Within a 4-day period in October 2020, we collected specimens from 591 subjects. Of them, 290 had COVID-19 associated symptoms. Results: While PCR positivity was detected in 223 cases, antigen test 1 and antigen test 2 were found positive in 148 (sensitivity 0.664, 95% CI 0.599 - 0.722) and 141 (sensitivity 0.623, 95% CI 0.558 - 0.684) patients, respectively. When only symptomatic patients were analysed, sensitivity increased to 0.738 (95% CI 0.667 - 0.799) for the antigen test 1 and to 0.685 (95% CI 0.611 - 0.750) for the antigen test 2. The substantial drop in sensitivity to 12.9% (95% CI 0.067 - 0.234) was observed for samples with the PCR threshold cycle above > 30. Conclusions: Low sensitivity of antigen tests leads to the considerable risk of false negativity. It is advisable to implement repeated testing with high enough frequency if the antigen test is used as a frontline screening tool.","Drevinek, P.; Hurych, J.; Kepka, Z.; Briksi, A.; Kulich, M.; Zajac, M.; Hubacek, P.",,207,20

OBJECTIVE: To quantify the economic value of the costs and benefits of a policy of continued limited reopening with social distancing relative to alternative COVID-19 response strategies in the United States. DESIGN: We estimate the number and value of quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) gained from mortality averted, with a value of $125,000 per QALY, and compare these benefits to the associated costs in terms of plausible effects on US GDP under a policy of continued limited reopening with social distancing relative to a policy of full reopening toward herd immunity. Using the same QALY value assumptions, we further evaluate cost-effectiveness of a return to Shelter-in-Place relative to a policy of limited reopening. SETTING: United States MEASUREMENTS: QALY and cost as percent of GDP of limited reopening with continued social distancing relative to a strategy of full reopening aimed at achieving herd immunity; a limited reopening “budget” measured in the number of months before this strategy fails to demonstrate cost-effectiveness relative to a full reopening; a shelter-in-place “threshold” measured in the number of lives saved at which a month of sheltering in place demonstrates cost effectiveness relative to the limited reopening strategy. RESULTS: QALY benefits from mortality averted by continued social distancing and limited reopening relative to a policy of full reopening exceed projected GDP costs if an effective vaccine or therapeutic can be developed within 11.1 months from late May 2020. White House vaccine projections fall within this date, supporting a partial reopening strategy. One month of shelter-in-place restrictions provides QALY benefits from averted mortality that exceed the associated GDP costs relative to limited reopening if the restrictions prevent at least 154,586 additional COVID-19 deaths over the course of the pandemic. Current models of disease progression suggest that limited reopening will not cause this many additional deaths, again supporting a limited reopening strategy. LIMITATION: Limited horizon of COVID-19 mortality projections; infection fatality ratio stable across strategies, ignoring both the potential for ICU overload to increase mortality and the deployment of partially effective therapeutics to decrease mortality; effect on GDP modeled as constant within a given phase of the pandemic; accounts for age and sex distribution of QALYs, but not effect of comorbidities; only considers impact from QALY lost due to mortality and from changes in GDP, excluding numerous other considerations, such as non-fatal COVID-19 morbidity, reduced quality of life caused by prolonged social distancing, or educational regression associated with prolonged school closures and restrictions. CONCLUSIONS: A limited reopening to achieve partial mitigation of COVID-19 is cost effective relative to a full reopening if an effective therapeutic or vaccine can be deployed within 11.1 months of late May 2020. One additional month of shelter-in-place restrictions should only be imposed if it saves at least 154,586 lives per month before the development of an effective therapeutic or vaccine relative to limited reopening.","Schonberger, Robert B.; Listokin, Yair J.; Ayres, Ian; Yaesoubi, Reza; Shelley, Zachary R.",medRxiv,207,23

The challenges of inaccessible WASH services along with the pandemic COVID-19 in low-income countries can lead to a devastating problem. METHOD: A systematic search of published articles was identified using PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, on relevant studies of COVID-19 and WASH services. Published articles were identified using abstracts and titles of the articles, followed by assessed for eligibility, and screening of the full text reports of relevant studies. RESULTS: Electronic database search identified 798 articles from which 28 full text articles were included in the systematic review. A lack of access to WASH services in households, schools, health care facilities, and other public spaces were the main identified COVID-19 related public health risks. A lack of adequate data and financial shortages were the challenges for mitigating the problems of COVI-19 and WASH services. CONCLUSION: This systematical review identified the impacts and challenges of COVID-19 in the provision of WASH services. The results implied that COVID-19 has significant impacts on WASH services that can affect the health of the public. Therefore, strengthening and ensuring access to WASH services are important for preventing COVID-19 and realizing human rights. Community engagement also can be used to support for prevention and control of COVID-19. Countries need to be expand their investment in WASH services as an important mechanism for mitigating COVID-19.","Desye, Belay",Environ Health Insights,207,16

The aim of these SARS-CoV-2 contact points was to ensure medical treatment for patients with (suspected) and without SARS-CoV-2 infection. The present study aimed to assess the beliefs and practices of primary care physicians who either led a Subspecialised Primary Care Practice or a Primary Care Practice providing care as usual in Baden-Wuerttemberg during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was based on a paper-based questionnaire in primary care physicians during the first wave of the pandemic. Participants were identified via the web page of the Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians Baden-Wuerttemberg. The questionnaire was distributed in June and July 2020. It measured knowledge, practices, self-efficacy and fears towards SARS-CoV-2, using newly developed questions. Data was descriptively analysed. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-five participants (92 leads of SARS-CoV-2 contact points/ 63 leads of primary care practices) completed the questionnaire. Out of 92 leads of SARS-CoV-2 contact points 74 stated to lead n Subspecialised Primary Care Practices. About half participants of both groups did not fear an own infection with the novel virus (between 50.8% and 62.2%), however about 75% feared financial loss. Knowledge was gained using various sources; main sources were the Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians (between 82.5% and 83.8%) and the German Society for Hygiene and Microbiology (RKI) (between 88.9% and 95.9%). Leads of Subspecialised Primary Care Practice felt more confident to perform anamnestic/diagnostic procedures (p < 0.001). The same was found for the confidence level regarding decision-making concerning the further treatment (p < 0.001). Several prevention measures to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 were adopted. Subspecialised Primary Care Practice had treated on average more patients with (suspected) COVID-19 (mean 408.12) than primary care practices (mean 83.8) (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that the Subspecialised Primary Care Practice that were implemented during the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic contributed containment of the pandemic. Leads of Subspecialised Primary Care Practice indicated that physical separation of patients with potential SARS-CoV-2 infection was easier compared to those who continued working in their own practice. Additionally, leads of Subspecialised Primary Care Practice felt more confident in dealing with patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Two arguments against voluntary vaccination are gaining ground. The first is that globalisation necessitates preparedness strategies for pandemics. Assuming sufficient supply, compulsory vaccination of adults and children constitutes a potential policy option in the context of a severe, vaccine‐preventable pandemic outbreak. The second argument is that children have a right to preventive medicine and thus to vaccination. The influence of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and its emphasis on parents as the trustees of their children's best interests, and the increasingly global nature of our collective and individual responsibilities with respect to the transmission of vaccine‐preventable disease present challenges to the right to refuse vaccination on our own behalf and on behalf of our children. Exploring methods of compulsion and persuasion utilised across Europe, the USA and Australia, this paper argues that necessity and proportionality must be reassessed, and national public health law and policy setting out a graduated and proportionate approach to compulsory vaccination developed as a matter of priority.","Cave, Emma",Leg Stud (Soc Leg Scholars),207,24

With the recent emergence of novel virulent strains, these viruses can have a large impact on human and animal health. Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is considered to be a reemerging pig disease caused by the enteropathogenic alphacoronavirus PED virus (PEDV). In the absence of effective vaccines, infection prevention and control through diagnostic testing and quarantine are critical. Early detection and differential diagnosis of PEDV infections increase the chance of successful control of the disease. Therefore, there is a continuous need for development of reduced assay-step protocols, no-wash, high-throughput immunoassays. This study described the characterization of the humoral immune response against PEDV under experimental and field conditions using a rapid, sensitive, luminescent proximity homogenous assay (AlphaLISA). PEDV IgG and IgA antibodies were developed toward the beginning of the second week of infection. PEDV IgG antibodies were detected for at least 16 weeks post-exposure. Remarkably, the serum IgA levels remained high and relatively stable throughout the study, lasting longer than the serum IgG response. Overall, AlphaLISA allows the detection and characterization of pathogen-specific antibodies with new speed, sensitivity, and simplicity of use. Particularly, the bridge assay constitutes a rapid diagnostic that substantially improves upon the “time to result” metric of currently available immunoassays.","Kimpston-Burkgren, Kay; Mora-Díaz, Juan Carlos; Roby, Philippe; Bjustrom-Kraft, Jordan; Main, Rodger; Bosse, Roger; Giménez-Lirola, Luis Gabriel",Pathogens,207,20

These changes are concentrated in the amino-terminal domains (NTDs) and the receptor-binding domains (RBDs) of complex modular spike protein trimers. The impact of this hypervariability on virus entry is often unclear, particularly with respect to sarbecovirus NTD variations. Therefore, we constructed indels and substitutions within hypervariable NTD regions and used severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus-like particles and quantitative virus-cell entry assays to elucidate spike structures controlling this initial infection stage. We identified NTD variations that increased SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-mediated membrane fusion and cell entry. Increased cell entry correlated with greater presentation of RBDs to ACE2 receptors. This revealed a significant allosteric effect, in that changes within the NTDs can orient RBDs for effective virus-cell binding. Yet, those NTD changes elevating receptor binding and membrane fusion also reduced interdomain associations, leaving spikes on virus-like particles susceptible to irreversible inactivation. These findings parallel those obtained decades ago, in which comparisons of murine coronavirus spike protein variants established inverse relationships between membrane fusion potential and virus stability. Considerable hypervariability in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein NTDs also appear to be driven by counterbalancing pressures for effective virus-cell entry and durable extracellular virus infectivity. These forces may selectively amplify SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.","Qing, Enya; Kicmal, Tom; Kumar, Binod; Hawkins, Grant M.; Timm, Emily; Perlman, Stanley; Gallagher, Tom",mBio,207,2

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of severe COVID‐19 infection on the gastrointestinal tract. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined clinicopathological findings in 28 resected ischaemic bowels from 22 patients with severe COVID‐19. Most patients required intubation preoperatively and presented with acute decompensation shortly before surgery. D‐dimer levels were markedly elevated in all measured cases (mean, 5394 ng/ml). Histologically, 25 cases (19 patients) showed evidence of acute ischaemia with necrosis. In this group, the most characteristic finding was the presence of small vessel fibrin thrombi (24 of 25 cases, 96%), which were numerous in 64% of cases. Patients with COVID‐19 were significantly more likely than a control cohort of 35 non‐COVID‐19‐associated acute ischaemic bowels to show isolated small intestine involvement (32% versus 6%, P < 0.001), small vessel fibrin thrombi (100% versus 43%, P < 0.001), submucosal vessels with fibrinous degeneration and perivascular neutrophils (90% versus 54%, P < 0.001), fibrin strands within submucosal vessels (58% versus 20%, P = 0.007), and histological evidence of pneumatosis (74% versus 34%, P = 0.010). Three cases in this cohort had histopathological findings normally seen in the setting of chronic ischaemia, notably prominent fibroblastic proliferation affecting the outer layer of the muscularis propria. CONCLUSIONS: Herein, we describe the histopathological findings in COVID‐19‐associated ischaemic bowels and postulate a relationship with the hypercoagulable state seen in patients with severe COVID‐19 infection.

Several animal models have been rapidly developed that recapitulate the asymptomatic to moderate disease spectrum. Now, there is a direct need for additional small animal models to study the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 and for fast-tracked medical countermeasure development. Here, we show that transgenic mice expressing the human SARS-CoV-2 receptor (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 [hACE2]) under a cytokeratin 18 promoter (K18) are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and that infection resulted in a dose-dependent lethal disease course. After inoculation with either 10(4) TCID(50) or 10(5) TCID(50), the SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in rapid weight loss in both groups and uniform lethality in the 10(5) TCID(50) group. High levels of viral RNA shedding were observed from the upper and lower respiratory tract and intermittent shedding was observed from the intestinal tract. Inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 resulted in upper and lower respiratory tract infection with high infectious virus titers in nasal turbinates, trachea and lungs. The observed interstitial pneumonia and pulmonary pathology, with SARS-CoV-2 replication evident in pneumocytes, were similar to that reported in severe cases of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in macrophage and lymphocyte infiltration in the lungs and upregulation of Th1 and proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines. Extrapulmonary replication of SARS-CoV-2 was observed in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of several animals at 7 DPI but not at 3 DPI. The rapid inflammatory response and observed pathology bears resemblance to COVID-19. Additionally, we demonstrate that a mild disease course can be simulated by low dose infection with 10(2) TCID(50) SARS-CoV-2, resulting in minimal clinical manifestation and near uniform survival. Taken together, these data support future application of this model to studies of pathogenesis and medical countermeasure development.","Yinda, Claude Kwe; Port, Julia R.; Bushmaker, Trenton; Offei Owusu, Irene; Purushotham, Jyothi N.; Avanzato, Victoria A.; Fischer, Robert J.; Schulz, Jonathan E.; Holbrook, Myndi G.; Hebner, Madison J.; Rosenke, Rebecca; Thomas, Tina; Marzi, Andrea; Best, Sonja M.; de Wit, Emmie; Shaia, Carl; van Doremalen, Neeltje; Munster, Vincent J.",PLoS Pathog,207,28

However, this approach is often criticized, as it is inherently inequitable. Internationalization at home is a newer concept that aims to provide students with international skills and experiences without exchange travel. We report detailed outcomes of an international online program during the COVID-19 pandemic, which aimed to include acquisition of cultural awareness and competency—similar to what the students would have obtained if they had travelled abroad. METHOD: Sixty-eight students from 12 international universities participated in international small peer group collaborative work, and online networking. Perceived improvement of cultural competency using Likert scale and open-ended questions was used as a measure of success. Furthermore, students’ definition of cultural competency in the different countries was obtained. RESULTS: Students improved their cultural competency skills. Data analysis supported statistically significant improvement of the above skills after the program, in comparison to the start of the program. DISCUSSION: Internationalization of medical education can be achieved at home—via structured online peer exchanges—and can provide students with intercultural skills and networking opportunities that are typically achieved via international in-person travel. The above represents a socially just and equitable way to reach all students and can result in improvement of their cultural competency, preparing them for their work in global health, and thereby resulting in improvement of global health.

OBJECTIVE: Utilizing a health system COVID-19 research registry, we assessed HCW risk for COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study with overlap propensity score weighting. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection in a large academic healthcare system (N = 72,909) from March 8–June 9, 2020, stratified by HCW and patient-facing status. MAIN MEASURES: SARS-CoV-2 test result, hospitalization, and ICU admission for COVID-19 infection.

Among those testing positive, weighted proportions for hospitalization were 7.4 vs. 15.9 for HCW vs. non-HCW with OR of 0.42 (CI 0.26–0.66) and for ICU admission: 2.2 vs. 4.5 for HCW vs. non-HCW with OR of 0.48 (CI 0.20–1.04). Those HCW identified as patient facing compared to not had increased odds of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test (OR 1.60, CI 1.08–2.39, proportions 8.6 vs. 5.5), but no statistically significant increase in hospitalization (OR 0.88, CI 0.20–3.66, proportions 10.2 vs. 11.4) and ICU admission (OR 0.34, CI 0.01–3.97, proportions 1.8 vs. 5.2). CONCLUSIONS: In a large healthcare system, HCW had similar odds for testing SARS-CoV-2 positive, but lower odds of hospitalization compared to non-HCW. Patient-facing HCW had higher odds of a positive test. These results are key to understanding HCW risk mitigation during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The goal of our study was to analyze, in a retrospective cohort study, the results of gynecological cancer surgery and evaluate postoperative complications in a single center in one of the most affected areas in Europe. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the records of patients who were referred between March 2020 and May 2020 for primary surgical treatment of breast, endometrial, ovarian, cervical, or vulvar cancer. RESULTS: The study included a total of 126 patients. Median age was 60 years (range 29–89). Patients were referred with breast (76/126, 60.3%), endometrial (29/126, 23%), ovarian (14/126, 11.1%), cervical (5/126, 4%), or vulvar cancer (2/126, 1.6%). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) was only conducted in 50% of cases due to the low availability of tests during the first phase of our study, and was indicated only in suspected cases according to the healthcare authorities' protocol. Median hospital stay was 1 day (range 0–18). Excluding breast surgery, laparoscopy was the most used procedure (43/126, 34.1%). 15 patients had a postoperative complication (15/126, 11.9%); only in 2 patients (2/15 13.3%) were there reports of Clavien–Dindo grade 3 or 4 complications. 6 patients tested positive for COVID-19 following a PCR diagnostic test, and these surgeries were cancelled. CONCLUSIONS: Adequate protective measures in the setting of COVID-19 free institutions enabled the continuity of cancer surgery without significant compromise of the safety of patients or healthcare workers.","de Santiago, Javier; Yelo, Carmen; F Chereguini, Maria; Conde, Ana; Galipienzo, Javier; Salvatierra, David; Linero, Manuel; Alonso, Sonsoles",Int J Gynecol Cancer,207,1

However, few internists currently use POCUS. The objective of this study was to understand the current determinants of POCUS adoption at both the health system and clinician level at a U.S. academic medical center from the perspective of multi-level stakeholders. We performed semi-structured interviews of multi-level stakeholders including hospitalists, subspecialists, and hospital leaders at an academic medical center in the U.S. Questions regarding the determinants of POCUS adoption were asked of study participants. Using the framework method, team-based analysis of interview transcripts were guided by the contextual domains of the Practical Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model (PRISM). Thirty-one stakeholders with diverse roles in POCUS adoption were interviewed. Analysis of interviews revealed three overarching themes that stakeholders considered important to adoption by clinicians and health systems: clinical impact, efficiency and cost. Subthemes included two that were deemed essential to high-fidelity implementation: the development of credentialing policies and robust quality assurance processes. These findings identify potential determinants of system and clinician level adoption that may be leveraged to achieve high-fidelity implementation of POCUS applications that result in improved patient outcomes.","Maw, Anna M.; Morris, Megan A.; Barnard, Juliana G.; Wilson, Juliana; Glasgow, Russell E.; Huebschmann, Amy G.; Soni, Nilam J.; Fleshner, Michelle; Kaufman, John; Ho, P.

As a first step in the design of such diagnostic procedures, the sensitivities and specificities of two viral diagnostic assays were compared in an experimental cell culture model: an indirect immuno-fluorescence assay using monoclonal antibodies and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction amplification of viral RNA from infected cells. Immunofluorescence detected human coronaviruses in cells infected at a MOI as low as 10(−2) (log TCID(50)/ml=4.25 for HCV-229E and 2.0 for HCV-OC43; log PFU/ml=4.83 for HCV-229E and 1.84 for HCV-OC43) versus 10(−3) (HCV-OC43) or 10(−4) (HCV-229E) for reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction amplification (log TCID(50)/ml=1.75 for HCV-229E and 1.5 for HCV-OC43; log PFU/ml=2.3 for HCV-229E and 1.34 for HCV-OC43). There were no false positive signals with other human respiratory pathogens: influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus and adenovirus. Moreover, each assay was coronavirus serogroup-specific.

We presented the outcomes of our patients to evaluate whether surgery could be safely performed and followed‐up without delaying any stage of GIS cancer during the pandemic. METHODS: This was an observational study of 177 consecutive patients who underwent elective GIS cancer surgery between March 11 and November 1, 2020. They were assessed regarding their perioperative and 60 days follow‐up results for either surgical or COVID‐19 status. Morbidity was determined according to the Clavien‐Dindo classification (CDC). Continuous and categorical data were presented as median ± SD and number with percentage (%), respectively. RESULTS: The study included 44 gastric, 33 pancreatic, 40 colon, and 59 rectal cancer patients. All patients underwent surgery and received neo/adjuvant treatments without delay. The overall morbidity (CDC grade II–IV) and mortality rates were 10.1% and 3.9%, respectively. None of the patients or medical staff were infected with COVID‐19 during the study period. CONCLUSION: GIS cancer surgery can be safely performed even within a pandemic hospital if proper isolation measures can be achieved for both patients and health workers. Regardless of the tumor stage, surgery should not be deferred, depending on unstandardized algorithms.","Sozutek, Alper; Seker, Ahmet; Kuvvetli, Adnan; Ozer, Nazmi; Genc, Ismail Caner",J Surg Oncol,207,5

METHODS: A case‐control study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital from March 1 to April 7, 2020. Health workers with suspected COVID‐19 infection were included. The presence of COVID‐19 was detected by using real‐time‐PCR methods. Positive and negative RT‐PCR patients were used as case and control groups, respectively. This study analyzed the incidence of COVID‐19 symptoms in both patient groups. Visual analog scales were used for self‐assessment of smell and taste disorders, ranging from 0 (no perception) to 10 (excellent perception). RESULTS: There were 215 (60.6%) patients with positive RT‐PCR and 140 (39.4%) patients with negative RT‐PCR. The presence of symptoms such as hyposmia hypogeusia, dysthermia and cough were strongly associated with a positive RT‐PCR. The association of cough and subjective hyposmia had 5.46 times higher odds of having a positive test. The ROC analysis showed that a fever higher than 37.45 °C, resulted in sensitivity and specificity of 0.65 and 0.61, respectively.

However, recent studies have discovered an intracellularly active complement system, the complosome, which has emerged as a central regulator of the core metabolic pathways fueling human immune cell activity. Induction of expression of components of the complosome, particularly complement component C3, during transmigration from the circulation into peripheral tissues is a defining characteristic of monocytes and T cells in tissues. Intracellular complement activity is required to induce metabolic reprogramming of immune cells, including increased glycolytic flux and OXPHOS, which drive the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IFN-γ. Consequently, reduced complosome activity translates into defects in normal monocyte activation, faulty Th1 and cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses and loss of protective tissue immunity. Intriguingly, neurological research has identified an unexpected connection between the physiological presence of innate and adaptive immune cells and certain cytokines, including IFN-γ, in and around the brain and normal brain function. In this opinion piece, we will first review the current state of research regarding complement driven metabolic reprogramming in the context of immune cell tissue entry and residency. We will then discuss how published work on the role of IFN-γ and T cells in the brain support a hypothesis that an evolutionarily conserved cooperation between the complosome, cell metabolism and IFN-γ regulates organismal behavior, as well as immunity.","Kunz, Natalia; Kemper, Claudia",Front Immunol,207,16

The MHV 3CLpro is similar to the picornavirus 3C proteinases in the relative location of confirmed catalytic histidine and cysteine residues and in the predicted use of Q/(S, A, G) dipeptide cleavage sites. However, less is known concerning the participation of aspartic acid or glutamic acid residues in catalysis by the coronavirus 3C-like proteinases or of the precise coding sequence of 3CLpro within the gene 1 polyprotein. In this study, aspartic acid residues in MHV 3CLpro were mutated and the mutant proteinases were tested for activity in anin vitro transcleavage assay. MHV 3CLpro was not inactivated by substitutions at Asp3386(D53) or Asp3398(D65), demonstrating that they were not catalytic residues. MHV 3CLpro was able to cleave at a glutamine–glycine (QG3607-8) dipeptide within the 3CLpro domain upstream from the predicted carboxy-terminal QS3635-6cleavage site of 3CLpro. The predicted full-length 3CLpro (S3334to Q3635) had an apparent mass of 27 kDa, identical to the p27 3CLpro in cells, whereas the truncated proteinase (S3334to Q3607) had an apparent mass of 24 kDa. This 28-amino-acid carboxy-terminal truncation of 3CLpro rendered it inactive in atranscleavage assay. Thus, MHV 3CLpro was able to cleave at a site within the putative full-length proteinase, but the entire predicted 3CLpro domain was required for activity. These studies suggest that the coronavirus 3CL-proteinases may have a substantially different structure and catalytic mechanism than other 3C-like proteinases.","Lu, Yiqi; Denison, Mark R.",Virology,207,16

Attention initially focussed on severe presentations, intensive care capacity, and the timely supply of equipment. General practice has seen a rapid take up of technology to allow virtual consultations, enabling the management of mild and moderate community cases. Aim To quantify the prevalence and time-course of suspected COVID-19 presenting to general practices during the London epidemic. To report disease prevalence by ethnic group, and explore how far differences by ethnicity can be explained by data in the electronic health record (EHR). Design and Setting Cross-sectional study using anonymised data from the primary care records of 1.3 million people registered with 157 practices in four adjacent east London clinical commissioning groups (CCGs). The study area includes 48% of people from ethnic minorities and is in the top decile of social deprivation in England. Method Suspected COVID-19 cases were identified using SNOMED codes. Explanatory variables included age, gender, self-reported ethnicity and measures of social deprivation. Clinical factors included 16 long-term conditions, latest body mass index and smoking status. Results There were 8,985 suspected COVID-19 cases. Ethnicity recording was 78% complete. Univariate analysis showed a two-fold increase in odds of infection for South Asian and Black adults compared to White. In a fully adjusted analysis, including clinical factors, the odds were: South Asian OR 1.93 (95% CI = 1.83 to 2.04) Black OR 1.47 (95% CI 1.38 to 1.57) Conclusions Using data in GP records Black and south Asian ethnicity remain as predictors of community cases of COVID-19, with levels of risk similar to hospital admission cases.

The effect of high titers of IgG against N-protein on clinical outcomes of SARS-CoV2 disease has not been described. We studied 400 RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV2 patients to determine independent factors associated with poor outcomes, including Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) admission, prolonged MICU stay and hospital admissions, and in-hospital mortality. We also measured serum IgG against the N protein and correlated its concentrations with clinical outcomes. We found that several factors, including Charlson comorbidity Index (CCI), high levels of IL6, and presentation with dyspnea were associated with poor clinical outcomes. It was shown that higher CCI and higher IL6 levels were independently associated with in-hospital mortality. Anti-N protein IgG was detected in the serum of 55 (55%) patients at the time of admission. A high concentration of antibodies, defined as signal to cut off ratio (S/Co) > 1.5 (75 percentile of all measurements), was found in 25 (25%) patients. The multivariable logistic regression models showed that between being an African American, higher CCI, lymphocyte counts, and S/Co ratio > 1.5, only S/Co ratio were independently associated with MICU admission and longer length of stay in hospital.

The demographic, clinical, laboratory, and chest imaging data of patients admitted to the ICU of Huoshenshan Hospital from February 10 to April 10, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Student's t-test and Chi-square test were used to compare the continuous and categorical variables, respectively. The logistic regression model was employed to ascertain the risk factors of mortality. This retrospective study involved 123 patients, including 64 dead and 59 survivors. Among them, 57 people were tested for interleukin-6 (IL-6) (20 died and 37 survived). In all included patients, the oxygenation index (PaO(2)/FiO(2)) was identified as an independent risk factor (odd ratio [OR] = 0.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.928–0.994, p = 0.021). The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.895 (95% CI: 0.826–0.943, p < 0.0001). Among the patients tested for IL-6, the PaO(2)/FiO(2) (OR = 0.955, 95%CI: 0.915–0.996, p = 0.032) and IL-6 (OR = 1.013, 95%CI: 1.001–1.025, p = 0.028) were identified as independent risk factors. The AUC was 0.9 (95% CI: 0.791–0.964, p < 0.0001) for IL-6 and 0.865 (95% CI: 0.748–0.941, p < 0.0001) for PaO(2)/FiO(2). PaO(2)/FiO(2) and IL-6 could potentially serve as independent risk factors for predicting death in COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care.","Gu, Yanli; Wang, Donghui; Chen, Cen; Lu, Wanjun; Liu, Hongbing; Lv, Tangfeng; Song, Yong; Zhang, Fang",Sci Rep,207,16

Conditional-independence network analysis revealed primary correlates of disease severity, including gene expression signatures of apoptosis in plasmacytoid dendritic cells and attenuated inflammation but increased fatty acid metabolism in CD56dimCD16hi NK cells linked positively to circulating IL-15. CD8+ T cell activation was apparent without signs of exhaustion. While cellular inflammation was depressed in severe patients early after hospitalization, it became elevated by days 17-23 post symptom onset, suggestive of a late wave of inflammatory responses. Furthermore, circulating protein trajectories at this time were divergent between and predictive of recovery-fatal outcomes.

Since there is a close association between other viral infection cases by epidemics and environmental factors, this study intends to unveil meteorological effects on the outbreak of COVID-19 across eight divisions of Bangladesh from March to April 2020. A compound Poisson generalized linear modeling (CPGLM), along with a Monte-Carlo method and random forest (RF) model, was employed to explore how meteorological factors affecting the COVID-19 transmission in Bangladesh. Results showed that subtropical climate (mean temperature about 26.6 °C, mean relative humidity (MRH) 64%, and rainfall approximately 3 mm) enhanced COVD-19 onset. The CPGLM model revealed that every 1 mm increase in rainfall elevated by 30.99% (95% CI 77.18%, − 15.20%) COVID-19 cases, while an increase of 1 °C of diurnal temperature (TDN) declined the confirmed cases by − 14.2% (95% CI 9.73%, − 38.13%) on the lag 1 and lag 2, respectively. In addition, NRH and MRH had the highest increase (17.98% (95% CI 22.5%, 13.42%) and 19.92% (95% CI: 25.71%, 14.13%)) of COVID-19 cased in lag 4. The results of the RF model indicated that TDN and AH (absolute humidity) influence the COVID-19 cases most. In the Dhaka division, MRH is the most vital meteorological factor that affects COVID-19 deaths. This study indicates the humidity and rainfall are crucial factors affecting the COVID-19 case, which is contrary to many previous studies in other countries. These outcomes can have policy formulation for the suppression of the COVID-19 outbreak in Bangladesh.","Islam, Abu Reza Md.

In the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has listed 12 comorbidities within the first tier that increase with the risk of severe illness from COVID-19, including the comorbidities that are common with increasing age (referred to as age-related comorbidities) and other comorbidities. However, the current method compares a population with and without a particular disease (or disorder), which may result in a bias in the results. Thus, comorbidity risks of COVID-19 mortality may be underestimated. Objective: To re-evaluate the mortality data from the US and estimate the odds ratios of death by major comorbidities with COVID-19, we incorporated the control population with no comorbidity reported and assessed the risk of COVID-19 mortality with a comorbidity. Methods: We collected all the comorbidity data from the public health websites of fifty US States and Washington DC (originally accessed on December 2020). The timing of the data collection should minimize bias from the COVID-19 vaccines and new COVID-19 variants. The comorbidity demographic data were extracted from the state public health data made available online. Using the inverse variance random-effects model, we performed a comparative analysis and estimated the odds ratio of deaths by COVID-19 with pre-existing comorbidities. Results: A total of 39,451 COVID-19 deaths were identified from four States that had comorbidity data, including Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and New York. 92.8% of the COVID-19 deaths were associated with a pre-existing comorbidity. The risk of mortality associated with at least one comorbidity combined was 1113 times higher than that with no comorbidity. The comparative analysis identified nine comorbidities with odds ratios of up to 35 times higher than no comorbidities. Of them, the top four comorbidities were: hypertension (odds ratio 34.73; 95% CI 3.63–331.91; p = 0.002), diabetes (odds ratio 20.16; 95% CI 5.55–73.18; p < 0.00001), cardiovascular disease (odds ratio 18.91; 95% CI 2.88–124.38; p = 0.002), and chronic kidney disease (odds ratio 12.34; 95% CI 9.90–15.39; p < 0.00001). Interestingly, lung disease added only a modest increase in risk (odds ratio 6.69; 95% CI 1.06–42.26; p < 0.00001). Conclusion: The aforementioned comorbidities show surprisingly high risks of COVID-19 mortality when compared to the population with no comorbidity. Major comorbidities were enriched with pre-existing comorbidities that are common with increasing age (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and hypertension). The COVID-19 deaths were mostly associated with at least one comorbidity, which may be a source of the bias leading to the underestimation of the mortality risks previously reported. We note that the method has limitations stemming primarily from the availability of the data. Taken together, this type of study is useful to approximate the risks, which most likely provide an updated awareness of age-related comorbidities.","Antos, Andrew; Kwong, Ming Lai; Balmorez, Timothy; Villanueva, Alyssa; Murakami, Shin",Infect Dis Rep,207,21

The number of countries reporting Variants of Concern (VOCs) with such mutations continues to rise. Here, we investigate two scenarios for third waves of the COVID pandemic: one driven by increased transmissibility, and another driven by immune escape. We do this using three mathematical models: a parsimonious susceptible-latent-infectious-recovered (SEIR) deterministic model with homogeneous mixing, an age-structured SARS-CoV-2 transmission model and a stochastic importation model. We calibrated our models to the situation in England in May 2021, although the insights will generalise to other contexts. We therefore accurately captured infection dynamics and vaccination rates, and also used these to explore the potential impact of a putative new VOC-targeted vaccine. Epidemiological trajectories for putative VOCs are wide-ranging and heavily dependent on their transmissibility, immune escape capability, and the time at which a postulated VOC-targeted vaccine may be introduced. We demonstrate that a VOC with either a substantial transmission advantage over resident variants, or the ability to evade vaccine-derived and prior immunity, is expected to generate a wave of infections and hospitalisations comparable to those seen in the winter 2020-21 wave. Moreover, a variant that is less transmissible, but shows partial immune-escape could provoke a wave of infection that would not be revealed until control measures are further relaxed.","Dyson, L.; Hill, E.

While Iran was among the first countries confronted with rapid spread of virus in February, no real-time SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome tracking is performed in the country. To address this issue, we provided 50 whole-genome sequences of viral isolates ascertained from different geographical locations in Iran during March-July 2020. The corresponding analysis on origins, transmission dynamics and genetic diversity, represented at least two introductions of the virus into the country, constructing two major clusters defined as B.4 and B.1*. The first entry of the virus occurred around 26 December 2019, as suggested by the time to the most recent common ancestor, followed by a rapid community transmission, led to dominancy of B.4 lineage in early epidemic till the end of June. Gradually, reduction in dominancy of B.4 occurred possibly as a result of other entries of the virus, followed by surge of B.1.* lineages, as of mid-May. Remarkably, variation tracking of the virus indicated the increase in frequency of D614G mutation, along with B.1* lineages, which showed continuity till October 2020. According to possible role of D614G in increased infectivity and transmission of the virus, and considering the current high prevalence of the disease, dominancy of this lineage may push the country into a critical health situation. Therefore, current data warns for considering stronger prohibition strategies preventing the incidence of larger crisis in future.","Fattahi, Z.; Mohseni, M.; Jalalvand, K.; Aghakhani Moghadam, F.; Ghaziasadi, A.; Keshavarzi, F.; Yavarian, J.; Jafarpour, A.; Mortazavi, S. e.; Ghodratpour, F.; Behravan, H.; Khazeni, M.; Momeni, S.

Using data from nonprobability-based Internet panel surveys administered by the Healthcare and Public Perceptions of Immunizations (HaPPI) Survey Collaborative, the acceptability of adolescent COVID-19 vaccination and self-reported factors increasing vaccination intent were assessed among independently recruited samples of 985 adolescents aged 13-17 years and 1,022 parents and guardians (parents) of adolescents aged 12-17 years during April 15-April 23, 2021, prior to vaccine authorization for this age group. Approximately one quarter (27.6%) of parents whose adolescents were already vaccine-eligible (i.e., aged 16-17 years) reported their adolescent had received ≥1 COVID-19 vaccine dose, similar to the proportion reported by vaccine-eligible adolescents aged 16-17 years (26.1%). However, vaccine receipt reported by parents of adolescents differed across demographic groups; parents identifying as female or Hispanic, or who had an education lower than a bachelor's degree reported the lowest adolescent COVID-19 vaccination receipt.

Over the years, it has been proposed that HCoVs play a possible role in gastrointestinal infections. OBJECTIVES: To assess the role of HCoVs in acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in children. STUDY DESIGN: Study was conducted at Tampere University Hospital over 2 years. Both stool and nasal swab samples were collected from 172 children with AGE, 545 with acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) and 238 with symptoms of both. The samples were tested for HCoVs by RT-PCR. RESULTS: HCoVs were detected in 52 (5.4%) children: in 6.4% of those with AGE, 4.4% with ARTI and 7.1% with symptoms of both. HCoVs OC43, HKU1, 229E and NL63 were encountered in 13, 11, 13 and 15 cases, respectively. HCoVs were detected simultaneously in stool and nasal swab samples in 17 children, in nasal swabs alone in 33 children, and in the stools alone in two children. HCoVs were present in the stools of eight (4.7%) of the 172 children with AGE; in six of these cases, the nasal swab sample was also positive for the respective HCoV. Additionally, in six of the eight cases, the stool sample contained either rotavirus or calicivirus. CONCLUSIONS: HCoVs can be detected in the stools of children with AGE, but usually together with well-known gastroenteritis viruses, and concomitantly in the respiratory tract. It appears that commonly circulating HCoVs do not have a significant role in the AGE of children admitted to hospital.","Paloniemi, Minna; Lappalainen, Suvi; Vesikari, Timo",J Clin Virol,207,20

MEASUREMENTS: Random blood samples at admission were collected for plasma glucose, interleukin-6 (IL6) and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) after written informed consent was obtained. Plasma glucose was analyzed by the automated analyzer, IL6 by chemiluminescent immunoassay and hsCRP by immune-turbidimetric assay. RESULTS: A total of 386 patients were studied (female 39.6%); 11.1% had severe disease and 4.1% expired. There were 67 (17.4%) patients with known diabetes mellitus (DM). Patients with a history of DM had three times higher mortality (6/67, 9%) than those without DM (10/309, 3.1%). Patients with moderate and severe disease according to ICMR and WHO grading had higher plasma glucose than those with asymptomatic or mild disease (P < 0.0001). Plasma glucose levels at admission were significantly higher in non-survivors when compared to those who survived (297 ± 117 vs 131 ± 73; P < 0.0001).

Objectives: The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of psychological distress and mental health needs among general public in Tamil Nadu subjected to lockdown, social distancing amidst COVID-19 crisis. Tamil Nadu is one of the worst affected states of southern India. Methods: A self-administered, web-based application study using ‘WHO-Self Reported Questionnaire-20’, in bilingual version, both English and Tamil, is used to screen the public for the level of distress. The study is done while the state is under extended lockdown and restricted movement. Key Findings: A total of 918 respondents participated in the survey and it is found that about more than one third of the respondents (∼35%) are under psychological distress. A significant association between younger age group, female gender, unmarried, people with children are found to be under distress. The lockdown had increased the frequency of smoking and quantity of cigarettes among smokers, also has increased the frequency of drinking among alcohol consumers. Of the SRQ-20 items recorded, stress related neurotic symptoms (>70%) was observed more than the depressive mood. About 33% of those scored > 7, had suicidal tendency. The districts declared red zones had significantly reported a greater number of respondents under distress.

Clinical guidelines recommend temperature measurement in these children, but little is known about parents’ experiences of and beliefs about temperature measurement. This study aimed to explore parents’ concerns and beliefs about temperature measurement in children. METHODS: Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted from May 2017 to June 2018 with 21 parents of children aged 4 months to 5.5 years, who were purposively sampled from the METRIC study (a method comparison study comparing non-contact infrared thermometers to axillary and tympanic thermometers in acutely ill children). Data analysis followed a thematic approach. RESULTS: Parents described the importance of being able to detect fever, in particular high fevers, and how this then influenced their actions. The concept of “accuracy” was valued by parents but the aspects of performance which were felt to reflect accuracy varied. Parents used numerical values of temperature in four main ways: determining precision of the thermometer on repeat measures, detecting a “bad” fever, as an indication to administer antipyretics, or monitoring response to treatment. Family and social networks, the internet, and medical professionals and resources, were all key sources of advice for parents regarding fever, and guiding thermometer choice. CONCLUSIONS: Temperature measurement in children has diagnostic value but can either empower, or cause anxiety and practical challenges for parents. This represents an opportunity for both improved communication between parents and healthcare professionals, and technological development, to support parents to manage febrile illness with greater confidence in the home.

Of the 26,602 individuals tested by PCR for SARS-CoV-2, 992 were COVID-19 positive (3.7% of Tested), 220 were admitted in the hospital (22% of COVID-19 positive), and 77 had a severe outcome (35% of Inpatient). Consistent with previous studies, males and individuals older than 65 years old had increased risk of inpatient admission. Notably, individuals self-identifying as Hispanic or Latino constituted an increasing percentage of COVID-19 patients as disease severity escalated, comprising 24% of those testing positive, but 40% of those with a severe outcome, a disparity that remained after correcting for medical comorbidities. Cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and renal disease were premorbid risk factors present before SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing associated with COVID-19 susceptibility. Less well-established risk factors for COVID-19 susceptibility included pre-existing dementia (odds ratio (OR) 5.2 [3.2–8.3], p=2.6 × 10(−10)), mental health conditions (depression OR 2.1 [1.6–2.8], p=1.1 × 10(−6)) and vitamin D deficiency (OR 1.8 [1.4–2.2], p=5.7 × 10(−6)). Renal diseases including end-stage renal disease and anemia due to chronic renal disease were the predominant premorbid risk factors for COVID-19 inpatient admission. Other less established risk factors for COVID-19 inpatient admission included previous renal transplant (OR 9.7 [2.8–39], p=3.2×10(−4)) and disorders of the immune system (OR 6.0 [2.3, 16], p=2.7×10(−4)). Prior use of oral steroid medications was associated with decreased COVID-19 positive testing risk (OR 0.61 [0.45, 0.81], p=4.3×10(−4)), but increased inpatient admission risk (OR 4.5 [2.3, 8.9], p=1.8×10(−5)). We did not observe that prior use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers increased the risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, being admitted to the hospital, or having a severe outcome. This study involving direct EHR extraction identified known and less well-established demographics, and prior diagnoses and medications as risk factors for COVID-19 susceptibility and inpatient admission. Knowledge of these risk factors including marked ethnic disparities observed in disease severity should guide government policies, identify at-risk populations, inform clinical decision making, and prioritize future COVID-19 research.","Chang, Timothy S; Ding, Yi; Freund, Malika K; Johnson, Ruth; Schwarz, Tommer; Yabu, Julie M; Hazlett, Chad; Chiang, Jeffrey N; Wulf, Ami; Geschwind, Daniel H; Butte, Manish J; Pasaniuc, Bogdan",medRxiv,207,16

We derive an empirical specification from the social planner’s resource constraint under the susceptible, infected, recovered, and deaths (SIRD) model and estimate how job losses and the case growth rate are related to people’s mobility using the Japanese prefecture-level panel data on confirmed cases, involuntary job losses, people’s mobility, and teleworkability. Our findings are summarized as follows. First, we find that a decrease in mobility driven by containment policies is associated with an increase in involuntary job separations, but the high teleworkability mitigates the negative effect of decreased mobility on job losses. Second, estimating how the case growth is related to people’s mobility and past cases, we find that the case growth rate is positively related to an increase in people’s mobility but negatively associated with past confirmed cases. Third, using these estimates, we provide a quantitative analysis of the trade-off between job losses and the number of confirmed cases. Taking Tokyo in July 2020 as a benchmark, we find that the cost of saving 1 job per month is 2.3 more confirmed cases per month in the short run of 1 month. When we consider a trade-off for 3 months from July to September of 2020, protecting 1 job per month requires 6.6 more confirmed cases per month. Therefore, the trade-off becomes worse substantially in the longer run of 3 months, reflecting the exponential case growth when the people’s mobility is high.","Hoshi, Kisho; Kasahara, Hiroyuki; Makioka, Ryo; Suzuki, Michio; Tanaka, Satoshi",Jpn Econ Rev (Oxf),207,6

Most large culverts are built decades ago from corrugated metal or reinforced concrete materials and now have reached their design life. A variety of renewal techniques can be utilized to enhance load carrying capacity of the existing deteriorated culverts and extend their design life. Spray applied pipe lining (SAPL) is a trenchless renewal methodology that applies layers of liner on the interior surface of the deteriorated host culvert. The SAPL’s generally fall into two categories: cementitious and polymeric materials. Currently, there is no standard method for structural design of SAPLs resulting in various methods being applied by SAPL vendors. To provide the essentials for development of a design methodology, the objective of this paper is to examine the structural performance of full scale soil box testing of 60 in. (1.5 m) diameter circular invert deteriorated (invert-cut) corrugated metal pipes (CMPs) renewed with three different thicknesses of polymeric SAPL. The inverts of the CMPs were cut to simulate invert deteriorated culvert in service conditions and maximize the applied static load on the SAPL. The pipe samples were backfilled with loose SP soil and buried under two feet (0.6 m) of soil cover. The performances of SAPL renewed CMPs were compared with a same size invert-cut bare CMP under the same testing configuration. The results indicated that depending on thickness of the polymeric SAPL, application of this method could improve the structural capacity of a fully deteriorated invert CMP culverts up to 80%.","Kohankar Kouchesfehani, Zahra; Darabnoush Tehrani, Amin; Najafi, Mohammad; Syar, Jeff",,207,16

In the lack of a specific treatment and vaccine for this novel infection, finding effective drugs against this infection is crucial. We suggest the hypothesis that crocin, the main carotenoid of saffron, has the potential to limit the progression and severity of the SARS‐CoV2 infection for several reasons: (a) crocin possesses powerful antioxidant properties, (b) crocin can alleviate the uncontrolled cytokine production responsible for acute lung injury, (c) crocin can upregulate PPARγ and downregulate NF‐κB expression which leads to a wide range of immunomodulatory and anti‐inflammatory effects, and (d) crocin can reduce the viral‐induced oxidative stress and downregulates ACE2 expression by activating Nrf2 pathway. We hope our hypothesis, corroborated by preclinical evidence, will inspire further targeted studies to test crocin as a beneficial drug against the SARS‐CoV2 infection. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Crocin is a natural antioxidant and the main active carotenoid components of saffron. We suggest the hypothesis that crocin has the potential to limit the progression and severity of the SARS‐CoV2 infection because of its antioxidant and anti‐inflammatory properties. Furthermore, this compound may prevent viral entry to host cells and reduce SARS‐CoV2‐induced lung injury. Therefore, we suggest further clinical studies on the effects of crocin against SARS‐Cov‐2 infection.","Ghasemnejad‐Berenji, Morteza",J Food Biochem,207,16

Expert guidance supports ECG monitoring to optimize patient safety. OBJECTIVE: To establish an enhanced process for ECG monitoring of patients being treated for COVID-19. METHODS: We created an SBAR (Situation Background Assessment Recommendation Tool) identifying the indication for ECGs in COVID-19 patients, and tagged these ECGs to ensure prompt over reading and identification of those with QT prolongation (QTc >470 ms for QRS < 120 ms, QTc > 500 ms for QRS > 120 ms). This triggered a phone call from the electrophysiology service to the primary team to provide management guidance and a formal consultation if requested. RESULTS: During a 2-week period we reviewed 2006 ECGs, corresponding to 524 unique patients, of whom 103 (19.7%) met SBAR defined criteria for QT prolongation. When compared to those without QT prolongation, these patients were more often in the intensive care unit (58.3% vs 35.4%) and more likely to be intubated (31.1 vs 18.1%). Fifty patients with QT prolongation (48.5%) had electrolyte abnormalities, 98 (95.1%) were on COVID-19 related QT prolonging medications, and 62 (60.2%) were on 1-4 additional non COVID-19 related QT prolonging drugs. Electrophysiology recommendations were given to limit modifiable risk factors. No patient developed torsade de pointes. CONCLUSION: This process functioned efficiently, identified a high percentage of patients with QT prolongation, and led to relevant interventions. Arrhythmias were rare. No patient developed torsade de pointes.","Jain, Shashank; Workman, Virginia; Ganeshan, Raj; Obasare, Edinrin R.; Burr, Alicia; DeBiasi, Ralph M.; Freeman, James V.; Akar, Joseph; Lampert, Rachel; Rosenfeld, Lynda E.",Heart Rhythm,207,21

This study aimed to determine the patient demographics, risk factors including comorbidities, and medications used to treat COVID-19, presenting symptoms and signs, and the outcome of management. METHODS: This was a retrospective, observational study of patients with COVID-19-associated ROCM managed or co-managed by ophthalmologists in India from January 1, 2020 to May 26, 2021. RESULTS: Of the 2826 patients, the states of Gujarat (22%) and Maharashtra (21%) reported the highest number of ROCM. The mean age of patients was 51.9 years with a male preponderance (71%). While 57% of the patients needed oxygen support for COVID-19 infection, 87% of the patients were treated with corticosteroids, (21% for > 10 days). Diabetes mellitus (DM) was present in 78% of all patients. Most of the cases showed onset of symptoms of ROCM between day 10 and day 15 from the diagnosis of COVID-19, 56% developed within 14 days after COVID-19 diagnosis, while 44% had delayed onset beyond 14 days. Orbit was involved in 72% of patients, with stage 3c forming the bulk (27%). Overall treatment included intravenous amphotericin B in 73%, functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS)/paranasal sinus (PNS) debridement in 56%, orbital exenteration in 15%, and both FESS/PNS debridement and orbital exenteration in 17%. Intraorbital injection of amphotericin B was administered in 22%. At final follow-up, mortality was 14%. Disease stage >3b had poorer prognosis. Paranasal sinus debridement and orbital exenteration reduced the mortality rate from 52% to 39% in patients with stage 4 disease with intracranial extension (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Corticosteroids and DM are the most important predisposing factors in the development of COVID-19-associated ROCM. COVID-19 patients must be followed up beyond recovery. Awareness of red flag symptoms and signs, high index of clinical suspicion, prompt diagnosis, and early initiation of treatment with amphotericin B, aggressive surgical debridement of the PNS, and orbital exenteration, where indicated, are essential for successful outcome.","Sen, Mrittika; Honavar, Santosh G; Bansal, Rolika; Sengupta, Sabyasachi; Rao, Raksha; Kim, Usha; Sharma, Mukesh; Sachdev, Mahipal; Grover, Ashok K; Surve, Abhidnya; Budharapu, Abhishek; Ramadhin, Abhishek K; Tripathi, Abhishek Kumar; Gupta, Adit; Bhargava, Aditya; Sahu, Animesh; Khairnar, Anjali; Kochar, Anju; Madhavani, Ankita; Shrivastava, Ankur K; Desai, Anuja K; Paul, Anujeet; Ayyar, Anuradha; Bhatnagar, Aparna; Singhal, Aparna; Nikose, Archana Sunil; Bhargava, Arun; Tenagi, Arvind L; Kamble, Ashish; Nariani, Ashiyana; Patel, Bhavin; Kashyap, Bibbhuti; Dhawan, Bodhraj; Vohra, Busaraben; Mandke, Charuta; Thrishulamurthy, Chinmayee; Sambare, Chitra; Sarkar, Deepayan; Mankad, Devashi Shirishbhai; Maheshwari, Dhwani; Lalwani, Dilip; Kanani, Dipti; Patel, Diti; Manjandavida, Fairooz P; Godhani, Frenali; Agarwal, Garima Amol; Ravulaparthi, Gayatri; Shilpa, Gondhi Vijay; Deshpande, Gunjan; Thakkar, Hansa; Shah, Hardik; Ojha, Hare Ram; Jani, Harsha; Gontia, Jyoti; Mishrikotkar, Jyotika P; Likhari, Kamalpreet; Prajapati, Kamini; Porwal, Kavita; Koka, Kirthi; Dharawat, Kulveer Singh; Ramamurthy, Lakshmi B; Bhattacharyya, Mainak; Saini, Manorama; Christy, Marem C; Das, Mausumi; Hada, Maya; Panchal, Mehul; Pandharpurkar, Modini; Ali, Mohammad Osman; Porwal, Mukesh; Gangashetappa, Nagaraju; Mehrotra, Neelima; Bijlani, Neha; Gajendragadkar, Nidhi; Nagarkar, Nitin M; Modi, Palak; Rewri, Parveen; Sao, Piyushi; Patil, Prajakta Salunkhe; Giri, Pramod; Kapadia, Priti; Yadav, Priti; Bhagat, Purvi; Parekh, Ragini; Dyaberi, Rajashekhar; Chauhan, Rajender Singh; Kaur, Rajwinder; Duvesh, Ram Kishan; Murthy, Ramesh; Dandu, Ravi Varma; Kathiara, Ravija; Beri, Renu; Pandit, Rinal; Rani, Rita Hepsi; Gupta, Roshmi; Pherwani, Ruchi; Sapkal, Rujuta; Mehta, Rupa; Tadepalli, Sameeksha; Fatima, Samra; Karmarkar, Sandeep; Patil, Sandeep Suresh; Shah, Sanjana; Shah, Sankit; Shah, Sapan; Dubey, Sarika; Gandhi, Saurin; Kanakpur, Savitha; Mohan, Shalini; Bhomaj, Sharad; Kerkar, Sheela; Jariwala, Shivani; Sahu, Shivati; Tara, Shruthi; Maru, Shruti Kochar; Jhavar, Shubha; Sharma, Shubhda; Gupta, Shweta; Kumari, Shwetha; Das, Sima; Menon, Smita; Burkule, Snehal; Nisar, Sonam Poonam; Kaliaperumal, Subashini; Rao, Subramanya; Pakrasi, Sudipto; Rathod, Sujatha; Biradar, Sunil G; Kumar, Suresh; Dutt, Susheen; Bansal, Svati; Ravani, Swati Amulbhai; Lohiya, Sweta; Rizvi, Syed Wajahat Ali; Gokhale, Tanmay; Lahane, Tatyarao P; Vukkadala, Tejaswini; Grover, Triveni; Bhesaniya, Trupti; Chawla, Urmil; Singh, Usha; Une, Vaishali L; Nandedkar, Varsha; Subramaniam, Venkata; Eswaran, Vidya; Chaudhary, Vidya Nair; Rangarajan, Viji; Dehane, Vipin; Sahasrabudhe, Vivek M; Sowjanya, Yarra; Tupkary, Yashaswini; Phadke, Yogita",Indian J Ophthalmol,207,21

By using a modified Delphi process, we sought to develop a structured framework to provide guidance regarding procedure indications and procedure time intervals. METHODS: A national panel of 14 expert gastroenterologists from throughout the US used a modified Delphi process, to achieve consensus regarding: i) common indications for general endoscopy, ii) critical patient-important outcomes for endoscopy, iii) defining time-sensitive intervals, iv) assigning time-sensitive intervals to procedure indications. Two anonymous rounds of voting were allowed before attempts at consensus were abandoned. RESULTS: Expert panel reached consensus that procedures should be allocated to one of three timing categories: (1) time-sensitive emergent = scheduled within 1 week, (2) time-sensitive urgent = scheduled within 1 to 8 weeks, (3) non-time sensitive = defer to > 8 weeks and reassess timing then. The panel identified 62 common general endoscopy indications (33 for EGD, 21 for colonoscopy, 5 for sigmoidoscopy). Consensus was reached on patient-important outcomes for each procedure indication, and consensus regarding timing of the procedure indication was achieved for 74% of indications. Panelists also identified adequate personal-protective-equipment, rapid point-of-care testing, and staff training as critical pre-conditions before endoscopy services could be resumed. CONCLUSIONS: We used the validated Delphi methodology, while prioritized patient-important outcomes, to provide consensus recommendations regarding triaging a comprehensive list of general endoscopic procedures.","Feuerstein, Assistant Professor of Medicine Joseph D.; Bilal, Mohammad; Berzin, Tyler M.; Calderwood, Audrey H.; Guturu, Praveen; Juncadella, Anna C.; Ketwaroo, Gyanprakash; Mishkin, Daniel S.; Perdue, David G.; Sekhon, Sandeep; Sengupta, Neil; Singh, Shailendra; Pleskow, Douglas K.; Sawhney, Mandeep S.",Tech Innov Gastrointest Endosc,207,1

In order for public health authorities and policy makers to effectively address the psychological distress associated with the pandemic, it is important to determine the prevalence and correlates of mental disorders, including depression. Objectives: We aimed to determine the prevalence, and demographic, social, clinical and other COVID-19 related correlates of major depressive disorder symptoms among the general population in Ghana during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: The study was a cross-sectional survey using online data collection methods. The survey assessed demographic, social and clinical variables as well as COVID-19 related variables. Major depressive disorder symptoms were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. The survey link was distributed primarily through WhatsApp-based platforms. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Results: The overall prevalence of likely MDD symptoms among the sample population was 12.3%. Variables such as employment, loss of jobs during the pandemic and rate of exposure to COVID-related news were independently and significantly associated with the likelihood that respondents had likely MDD. Variables such as gender, relationship, housing status and having a family member or friend who was sick from COVID-19 were not independently significantly associated with the likelihood that respondents had likely MDD, when all other factors in the model were controlled. Conclusion: This study has identified the prevalence and correlates of depression symptoms in Ghana during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is the urgent need for mental health policy makers and the government of Ghana to have policies in place to alleviate the potential threat to the mental health of the population.","Adu, Medard Kofi; Wallace, Lauren J.; Lartey, Kwabena F.; Arthur, Joshua; Oteng, Kenneth Fosu; Dwomoh, Samuel; Owusu-Antwi, Ruth; Larsen-Reindorf, Rita; Agyapong, Vincent I.

Termed CODA (CRISPR Optical Detection of Anisotropy), the method combined isothermal nucleic acid amplification, activation of CRISPR/Cas12a, and signal generation in a single assay, eliminating extra manual steps. Importantly, signal detection was based on the ratiometric measurement of fluorescent anisotropy, which allowed CODA to achieve a high signal-to-noise ratio. For point-of-care operation, we built a compact, standalone CODA device integrating optoelectronics, an embedded heater, and a microcontroller for data processing. The developed system completed SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection within 20 min of sample loading; the limit of detection reached 3 copy/μL.

However, these findings are based on rating scales that only allow us to measure the strength of this support. This article proposes a new measure of how voters evaluate Prime Ministers (PM) by asking for descriptive keywords that are analyzed by natural language processing. METHODS: By collecting a representative sample of citizens’ own key words describing their PM in 15 countries in Europe during the outbreak of Covid‐19, and analyzing these by latent semantic analysis and a multiple OLS regression, we could quantify the strength and direction of voters’ view. RESULTS: The strength analysis supported previous studies that describing the PM with positive words was strongly associated with vote intention. Furthermore, a change in the direction of the attitudes from “good” to “honest” was found. A new finding was that the pandemic was associated with an increase in polarization. CONCLUSIONS: The keyword evaluation analysis provides opportunities of evaluating both strength and direction of voters’ view of their PM, where we show new results related to increased polarization and shift in the direction of attitudes.","Fredén, Annika; Sikström, Sverker",Soc Sci Q,207,24

Objective To assess pregnancy outcomes with COVID-19 lessons learned from the pandemic. Study design This retrospective observational study was conducted at Teerthanker Mahaveer Medical College and Research Centre, Moradabad, a level 3 COVID hospital in Northern India, with a patient pool of all the antenatal females diagnosed COVID 19 positive via a positive quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) test of maternal pharyngeal and nasal swab samples in the given time period of three months and ten days, i.e., May 25, 2020 to September 3, 2020. In conjunction with maternal outcomes, neonatal outcomes including evidence of perinatal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was assessed by testing neonatal pharyngeal swab samples. Results Out of 100 COVID-19 positive patients, the average age of women was 26.2 years, 73 women (73%) were asymptomatic, and 50 patients (50%) women had associated co-morbidities such as anaemia in 38 (38%) women, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) in four patients (4%) each, respectively. No case of spontaneous abortion in early gestation was reported. Out of 100 patients, 32 (32%) patients delivered during their stay, out of which 17 women (53.1%) delivered via cesarean section which was performed mainly due to obstetric indications. One maternal death was reported due to antepartum eclampsia which was unrelated to COVID-19 complications. Five neonates were born prematurely, out of which three were delivered followed by spontaneous premature preterm rupture of membranes (PPROM). The Appearance Pulse Grimace Activity Respiration (APGAR) score was recorded to be ≥9 at the five minutes mark in 28 out of 30 live babies (93.3%) and the birth weight of the babies ranged from 1.8 to 3.5 kg) with an average birth weight of 2.71 kg. Two neonatal deaths were reported due to respiratory distress. There were two documented intrauterine demise (IUD) cases both due to PIH. Furthermore, all 30 live neonates tested for SARS CoV-2 had negative results. Conclusion The spectrum of Coronavirus infection leans more towards asymptomatic and mild symptomatic clinical presentation. Favourably, the likelihood of spontaneous preterm birth was not escalated in our current study and remained low. The rate of intrauterine fetal demise and neonatal death were less. As none of the neonates tested positive for COVID-19, there is no corroborative proof of vertical perinatal transmission.","Siddiqui, Saima; Najam, Rehana",Cureus,207,1

But the diagnostic sensitivity of nasopharyngeal PCR decreases with increase in lapse between the infection and presentation to hospital. This might lead to dire consequences of labelling these patients as false negative, though such patients have been proved to be potentially infective since viral shedding occurs through other body fluids (stools) for long. COVID infection reveals that the IgM antibodies start to appear as early as 5th day of infection and switches over to IgA within 2–3 days. The aim of the study was to see if COVID antibody testing be coupled with PCR for diagnosis especially in patients presenting late (more than 14 days) of onset of infection? And if the antibodies are giving values, hence can them be reported quantitatively rather than in qualitative fashion? The second objective was to see if the COVID antibody levels be used to monitor the disease severity? And if the antibody levels of SARS CoV 2 be used an indicator to monitor the recovery?","Ramanathan, Satish",Indian J Clin Biochem,207,16

Here we have used next generation sequencing and conventional approaches to identify the first canine kobuvirus (CaKoV) from outside the USA. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that a single lineage genotype of CaKoV now exists in Europe and the USA with 94% nucleotide similarity in the coding region. CaKoV was only identified in a single case from a case–control study of canine diarrhoea, suggesting this virus was not a frequent cause of disease in this population. Attempts to grow CaKoV in cell culture failed. Sequence analysis suggested CaKoV was distinct from human Aichi virus (AiV), and unlikely to pose a significant zoonotic risk. Serosurveys by ELISA, immunofluorescence and neutralisation tests, using AiV as antigen, suggested kobuvirus infection is prevalent in dogs. In addition, IgG antibody to AiV was also detected in cat sera, indicating for the first time that cats may also be susceptible to kobuvirus infection.","Carmona-Vicente, N.; Buesa, J.; Brown, P.A.; Merga, J.Y.; Darby, A.C.; Stavisky, J.; Sadler, L.; Gaskell, R.M.; Dawson, S.; Radford, A.D.",Vet Microbiol,207,26

However, it is currently unknown if obesity plays a role in the clinical manifestations and prognosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected patients. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether obesity played a role in clinical manifestations and prognosis in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: This is a retrospective multicenter clinical study. A total of 96 patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled from Dongguan People’s Hospital, Nanfang hospital and the First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University between 23 January and 14 February 2020. Demographic and clinical data were extracted from medical records. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was defined as oxygenation index (PaO(2)/FiO(2)) ≤ 300 mmHg. We grouped patients through the body mass index (BMI). Associations were examined using the t test, χ(2) test and multivariate logistic forward regression test. RESULTS: Patients with BMI < 24 were significantly younger (P = 0.025) with lower creatine kinase (P = 0.013), lower diastolic pressure blood (P = 0.035), lower serum creatinine (P = 0.012), lower lactate dehydrogenase (P = 0.001) and higher platelet count (P = 0.002). The BMI level was 20.78 ± 3.15 in patients without pneumonia compared with the patients with pneumonia (23.81 ± 3.49, P = 0.001). For patients without ARDS, an average BMI level of 22.65 ± 3.53 was observed, significantly lower than patients with ARDS (24.57 ± 3.59, P = 0.022). The mean BMI was 22.35 ± 3.56 in patients experienced with relieving the clinical symptoms or stable condition by radiographic tests, lower than patients with disease exacerbation with 24.89 ± 3.17 (P = 0.001). In addition, lymphocyte count (r = − 0.23, P = 0.027) and platelet count (r = − 0.44, P < 0.001) were negatively correlated with BMI. While hemoglobin (r = 0.267, P = 0.008), creatine kinase (r = 0.331, P = 0.001), serum creatinine (r = 0.424, P < 0.001) and lactate dehydrogenase (r = 0.343, P = 0.001) were significantly positive correlated with BMI. Multivariate analysis showed that older age (OR = 1.046, P = 0.009) and BMI ≥ 24 (OR = 1.258, P = 0.005) were independent risk factors associated ICU admission while BMI ≥ 24 (OR = 4.219, P = 0.007) was independent risk factor associated with radiographic disease exacerbation. CONCLUSIONS: Our study found BMI was significantly associated with clinical manifestations and prognosis of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. For patients with increased risk, clinicians should intervene promptly to avoid disease progression.","Cai, Shao-Hang; Liao, Wei; Chen, Shu-Wei; Liu, Li-Li; Liu, Si-Yao; Zheng, Zhi-Dan",Infect Dis Poverty,207,5

Thus, new therapeutic strategies and effective vaccines are urgently needed to cope with this severe pandemic. The development of a broadly neutralizing antibody against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is one of the attractive treatment strategies for COVID-19. Currently, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein is the main target of neutralizing antibodies when SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells through an interaction between the S protein and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 expressed on various human cells. A single monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment is prone to selective pressure due to increased possibility of targeted epitope mutation, leading to viral escape. In addition, the antibody-dependent enhancement effect is a potential risk of enhancing the viral infection. These risks can be reduced using multiple mAbs that target nonoverlapping epitopes. Thus, a cocktail therapy combining two or more antibodies that recognize different regions of the viral surface may be the most effective therapeutic strategy.","Lai, Rongtao; Zhou, Tianhui; Xiang, Xiaogang; Lu, Jie; Xin, Haiguang; Xie, Qing",Front Med,207,16

Task-shifting, which involves training non-specialized community health workers (CHW) to deliver basic education and health services is a favorable strategy to address this problem, however very little data exist on this topic in the Middle East region. We conducted a long-term evaluation of the Women’s Health Certificate delivered to Syrian refugees and host community in informal tented settlements in Lebanon under the Mobile University for Health (MUH) program. The training was delivered through a mobile classroom approach that incorporated a blended learning modality. METHODS: We collected short-term data from the 42 trained CHW (knowledge assessments and satisfaction measures) during the delivery of the intervention between March and August 2019, and long-term data (semi-structured interviews with 8 CHW and focus group discussion with 9 randomly selected community members) one year later between July and August 2020. The evaluation approach was informed by the Kirkpatrick evaluation model, and the qualitative data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Data from the CHWs and community members were triangulated, and they showed that the training enhanced access to education due to its mobile nature and provided opportunities for CHWs to engage and interact with learning material that enhanced their knowledge and favorable behaviors regarding women’s health. In turn, CHWs were empowered to play an active role in their communities to transfer the knowledge they gained through educating community members and providing women’s health services and referrals. Community members benefited from the CHWs and called for the implementation of more similar training programs. CONCLUSION: This is one of few studies reporting a long-term community-level evaluation of a task-shifting program on women’s health among displaced populations in Lebanon. Our findings support the need to increase funding for similar programs, and to focus on delivering programs for a variety of health challenges. It is also essential to enhance the reach and length of recruitment to wider communities, to design concise, interactive, and engaging sessions, and to provide tools to facilitate circulation of learning material, and resources for referrals to health services.","Naal, Hady; Mendelsohn, Rebecca; Brome, Dayana; Noubani, Aya; Nabulsi, Dana; Muhieddine, Dina; Saleh, Shadi",Hum Resour Health,207,27

The influenza A (H1N1) 2009 monovalent vaccine (H1N1 vaccine) became available in the U.S. in October 2009. PURPOSE: To assess 2009 H1N1 and seasonal influenza vaccination coverage and identify factors independently associated with vaccination among HCP in the U.S. METHODS: Data from the 2009–2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) influenza supplemental survey were analyzed in 2011. Multivariable logistic regression and predictive marginal models were performed to identify factors independently associated with vaccination among HCP. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis procedure was used to estimate the cumulative proportion of people vaccinated. RESULTS: Among 16,975 HCP surveyed, 2009 H1N1, seasonal, and any-dose vaccination coverage were 34.1% (95% CI=32.7%, 35.5%); 52.4% (95% CI=50.9%, 53.9%); and 58.0% (95% CI=56.5%, 59.5%), respectively, all of which were significantly higher than those for non-HCP (19.1%, 34.9%, and 40.3%, respectively). The H1N1 vaccination coverage among HCP ranged from 18.4% in Mississippi to 56.1% in Massachusetts and seasonal influenza vaccination coverage ranged from 40.4% in Florida to 73.1% in Nebraska. Characteristics independently associated with an increased likelihood of 2009 H1N1, seasonal, and any-dose vaccinations among HCP were as follows: non-Hispanic white, higher income, having a high-risk condition, having health insurance, the ability to see a doctor if needed, and having had a routine checkup in the previous year. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination coverage was higher among HCP than non-HCP but still below the national health objective of 90%. Knowledge of national and state-specific H1N1 and seasonal vaccination coverage among HCP is useful for evaluating the vaccination campaign and implementing strategies for increasing yearly seasonal vaccination coverage and improving vaccination coverage among HCP in possible future pandemics.","Lu, Peng-jun; Ding, Helen; Black, Carla L.",Am J Prev Med,207,20

To date, there are no specific drugs formulated for it, and researchers around the globe are racing against the clock to investigate potential drug candidates. The repurposing of existing drugs in the market represents an effective and economical strategy commonly utilized in such investigations. In this study, we used a multiple-sequence alignment approach for preliminary screening of commercially-available drugs on SARS-CoV sequences from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) isolates. The viral genomic sequences from KSA isolates were obtained from GISAID, an open access repository housing a wide variety of epidemic and pandemic virus data. A phylogenetic analysis of the present 164 sequences from the KSA provinces was carried out using the MEGA X software, which displayed high similarity (around 98%). The sequence was then analyzed using the VIGOR4 genome annotator to construct its genomic structure. Screening of existing drugs was carried out by mining data based on viral gene expressions from the ZINC database. A total of 73 hits were generated. The viral target orthologs were mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 KSA isolate sequence by multiple sequence alignment using CLUSTAL OMEGA, and a list of 29 orthologs with purchasable drug information was generated. The results showed that the SARS CoV replicase polyprotein 1a had the highest sequence similarity at 79.91%. Through ZINC data mining, tanshinones were found to have high binding affinities to this target. These compounds could be ideal candidates for SARS-CoV-2. Other matches ranged between 27 and 52%. The results of this study would serve as a significant endeavor towards drug discovery that would increase our chances of finding an effective treatment or prevention against COVID19.","Mok, Pooi Ling; Koh, Avin Ee-Hwan; Farhana, Aisha; Alsrhani, Abdullah; Alam, Mohammad Khursheed; Suresh Kumar, Subbiah",Saudi J Biol Sci,207,7

This paper builds on disaster studies' theory that hazards become a disaster in interaction with vulnerability and response policies, yet often lead to renewed disaster risk creation. The paper is based on seven case studies of countries that experienced social conflict at the advent of the pandemic outbreak: The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Haiti, Zimbabwe, Philippines, India, Brazil and Chile. Country studies were implemented by students and researchers residing at the International Institute of Social Studies, using remote interviews and secondary sources, and covered the period from March to August 2020. Findings show that authorities instrumentalised Covid-19 to strengthen their control and agendas. While taking responsibility for lockdowns, this was not accompanied with care to mitigate the adverse effects. Social conflict shaped the response, as high levels of mistrust in authorities complicated the implementation of measures, while authorities did not support community-based coping initiatives. The paper concludes that whether Covid-19 will trigger or exacerbate conflict and vulnerabilities depends on pre-existing, country-specific conditions, and how a government and other actors frame and respond to Covid-19.

METHODS: The academic hospital‐based iCMP enrolls the top 2% of medically and psychosocially complex patients identified on the basis of clinical complexity health care use, and primary care provider referral. A nurse conducts needs assessments and coordinates care. We reviewed the electronic medical records of enrolled patients with SLE to identify SDoH needs and corresponding actions taken 1 year prior to iCMP enrollment using physicians’ and social workers’ notes, and during enrollment using iCMP team members’ notes. RESULTS: Among 69 patients with SLE in the iCMP, in the year prior to enrollment, 57% had documentation of one or more SDoH challenges, compared with 94% during enrollment. iCMP nurses discussed and addressed one or more SDoH issues for 81% of the patients; transportation challenges, medication access, mental health care access, and financial insecurity were the most prevalent. Nurses connected 75% of these patients with related resources and support. CONCLUSION: Although SDoH‐related issues were not used to identify patients for the iCMP, the vast majority of enrolled medically and psychosocially complex patients with SLE had these needs. The iCMP team uncovered and addressed SDoH‐related concerns not documented prior to iCMP participation. Expansion of care management programs like the iCMP would help identify, document, and address these barriers that contribute to disparities in chronic disease care and outcomes.","Taber, Kreager A.; Williams, Jessica N.; Huang, Weixing; McLaughlin, Katherine; Vogeli, Christine; Cunningham, Rebecca; Wichmann, Lisa; Feldman, Candace H.",ACR Open Rheumatol,207,5

A number of medically-relevant zoonotic pathogens are negative-strand RNA viruses (NSVs). NSVs are derived from different virus families. Examples like Ebola are known for causing severe symptoms and high mortality rates. Some, like influenza, are known for their ease of person-to-person transmission and lack of pre-existing immunity, enabling rapid spread across many countries around the globe. Containment of outbreaks of NSVs can be difficult owing to their unpredictability and the absence of effective control measures, such as vaccines and antiviral therapeutics. In addition, there remains a lack of essential knowledge of the host–pathogen response that are induced by NSVs, particularly of the immune responses that provide protection. Vaccines are the most effective method for preventing infectious diseases. In fact, in the event of a pandemic, appropriate vaccine design and speed of vaccine supply is the most critical factor in protecting the population, as vaccination is the only sustainable defense. Vaccines need to be safe, efficient, and cost-effective, which is influenced by our understanding of the host–pathogen interface. Additionally, some of the major challenges of vaccines are the establishment of a long-lasting immunity offering cross protection to emerging strains. Although many NSVs are controlled through immunisations, for some, vaccine design has failed or efficacy has proven unreliable. The key behind designing a successful vaccine is understanding the host–pathogen interaction and the host immune response towards NSVs. In this paper, we review the recent research in vaccine design against NSVs and explore the immune responses induced by these viruses. The generation of a robust and integrated approach to development capability and vaccine manufacture can collaboratively support the management of outbreaking NSV disease health risks.","Mara, Kostlend; Dai, Meiling; Brice, Aaron M.; Alexander, Marina R.; Tribolet, Leon; Layton, Daniel S.; Bean, Andrew G.

Methods: Retrospective observational study based on information provided by two administrative databases. One of these two databases contains information on all patients seen in our hospital and diagnosed with COVID-19 infection between March 4th 2020 and April 26th 2020. The other database contains data from patients seen at Rheumatology, Dermatology and Digestive Departments in our hospital who are currently receiving biological therapy. We calculated the crude and age and sex adjusted incidence in both groups. To compare both groups we calculated the Incidence Rate Ratio. Results: There was a total of 2,182 patients with COVID-19 requiring hospitalization. Four patients out of a total of 797 patients receiving biological therapy had contracted COVID-19 and required hospital care. Crude incidence rate of COVID-19 requiring hospital care among the general population was 1.41%, and it was 0.50% among the group receiving biological therapy.

Wellness can relate to many areas or domains in our lives such as financial, social, spiritual, physical, and occupational, whereas well-being is career focused. Wellness is multidimensional and encompasses different domains, and well-being usually focuses on a singular domain. Literature supports the study of well-being in health care workers; however, research is limited for assessing wellness in different domains of health care workers. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to describe perceived pharmacy resident wellness during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: A 67-item survey was sent by e-mail to eligible study participants, including any postgraduate year (PGY) 1, 2, or 24-month pharmacy resident completing/completed their training in June 2019-July 2020. The primary outcome was perceived resident wellness based on the 7 domains from Princeton UMatter Wellness Self-Assessment, developed to measure self-perceptions of wellness across dimensions. Descriptive statistics and participant scores were aggregated and presented as a total domain score. Statistics and scores were determined from completed surveys. RESULTS: A total of 418 participants accessed the survey, 384 met inclusion criteria, and 326 completed the survey. Of the participants, 77% were female with 85% completing a traditional PGY-1 residency program. The wellness domain with the lowest total was physical wellness, with a domain median of 23 of 28. The highest-scoring domain was social wellness, with a median of 27. CONCLUSION: Perceived resident wellness during COVID-19 was highest in the social domain and lowest in the physical wellness domain.

These respiratory problems due to viral infection become a public health concern due to rapid transmission through air/aerosols or via direct-indirect contact with infected persons. In addition, the cross-species transmission causes alterations to viral genetic makeup thereby increasing the risk of emergence of pathogens with new and more potent infectivity. With the introduction of effective nucleic acid-based technologies, post translational gene silencing (PTGS) is being increasingly used to silence viral gene targets and has shown promising approach towards management of many viral infections. Since several host factors are also utilized by these viruses during various stages of infection, silencing these host factors can also serve as promising therapeutic tool. Several nucleic acid-based technologies such as short interfering RNAs (siRNA), antisense oligonucleotides, aptamers, deoxyribozymes (DNAzymes), and ribozymes have been studied and used against management of respiratory viruses. These therapeutic nucleic acids can be efficiently delivered through the airways. Studies have also shown efficacy of gene therapy in clinical trials against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) as well as models of respiratory diseases including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), measles and influenza. In this review, we have summarized some of the recent advancements made in the area of nucleic acid based therapeutics and highlighted the emerging roles of nucleic acids in the management of some of the severe respiratory viral infections.

A worrisome side effect of the Covid-19 pandemic is the delay in surgical treatment for seriously ill patients, a rise in surgical complications due to delayed care, lack of access to the healthcare system, and patients' hesitancy to seek care due to fear of the virus. In Ecuador, where limitations were present even in the absence of a pandemic, we are yet to fully know the full extent of the damage this pandemic has caused to ourselves and our patients. PRESENTATION OF CASE: We present the case of a 51-year-old female; she presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and a gastric GIST was diagnosed. Due to the size and the symptoms, surgery was planned. Nonetheless, as Ecuador was hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic to cope with the respiratory patients, surgeries were delayed or canceled. Our patient surgery was delayed for five months until she presented with severe gastrointestinal bleeding that required urgent action and care. Thankfully, she completely recovered. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: This case is an example of the many complications we expect due to the pandemic; delay in treatment leads to troublesome complications. In these emergencies, time is of the essence, and surgical services must rise to the challenge; in a particular way, this case also proves that if there are the necessary tools to enhance the patient's recovery, we should hesitate to use them. Complete resection of the gastric GIST in a prompt matter must be done to avoid these potentially deadly complications.","Aguayo, William G.; Moyon, F.

Here we describe SARS-CoV-2 infection complicated by neuroinvasion in the post-mortem tissues of a child. METHODS: We performed a complete autopsy of a 14-month-old child who died of COVID-19 pneumonitis. Histological sections of multiple organs were stained with haematoxylin and eosin. Luxol fast blue staining for myelin and immunohistochemistry were performed in selected areas of the brain. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 was investigated by immunostaining with anti-spike protein antibody and by RT-qPCR. FINDINGS: Lesions included microthrombosis, pulmonary congestion, interstitial oedema, lymphocytic infiltrates, bronchiolar injury, collapsed alveolar spaces, cortical atrophy, and severe neuronal loss. SARS-CoV-2 staining was observed along the apical region of the choroid plexus (ChP) epithelium and in ependymal cells of the lateral ventricle, but was restricted to ChP capillaries and vessels in some regions. SARS-CoV-2 infection of brain tissue was confirmed by RT-qPCR in fragments of the ChP, lateral ventricle, and cortex. INTERPRETATION: Our results show multisystemic histopathological alterations caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection and contribute to knowledge regarding the course of fatal COVID-19 in children. Furthermore, our findings of ChP infection and viral neurotropism suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may invade the central nervous system by blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier disruption.

RESUMO: Complicações sistêmicas e neurológicas foram descritas em adultos com COVID-19 grave. Neste trabalho, descrevemos a infecção por SARS-CoV-2, incluindo sua neuroinvasão, nos tecidos post-mortem de uma criança. MÉTODOS: Realizamos a autópsia completa de uma criança de 14 meses que morreu de pneumonite por COVID-19. Cortes histológicos de múltiplos órgãos foram corados com Hematoxilina e Eosina. A coloração de Luxol Fast Blue para mielina e imuno-histoquímica foram realizadas em áreas selecionadas do cérebro. A presença de SARS-CoV-2 foi investigada por imunomarcação com anticorpo anti-proteína spike e por RT-qPCR. ACHADOS: As lesões incluíram microtrombose, congestão pulmonar, edema intersticial, infiltrados linfocíticos, lesão bronquiolar, colapso dos espaços alveolares, atrofia cortical e perda neuronal grave. A presença de SARS-CoV-2 foi observada ao longo da região apical do epitélio do plexo coróide (PC) e nas células ependimárias do ventrículo lateral, mas ficou restrita aos capilares e vasos do PC em outras regiões. A infecção do tecido cerebral por SARS-CoV-2 foi confirmada por RT-qPCR em fragmentos do PC, ventrículo lateral e cortex cerebral.

Various structural classes of compounds have been identified as effective ingredients. However, little is known at genetics level about these active metabolites. In the present study, we performed de novo transcriptome sequencing for the first time to produce a comprehensive dataset of I. indigotica. RESULTS: A database of 36,367 unigenes (average length = 1,115.67 bases) was generated by performing transcriptome sequencing. Based on the gene annotation of the transcriptome, 104 unigenes were identified covering most of the catalytic steps in the general biosynthetic pathways of indole, terpenoid, and phenylpropanoid. Subsequently, the organ-specific expression patterns of the genes involved in these pathways, and their responses to methyl jasmonate (MeJA) induction, were investigated. Metabolites profile of effective phenylpropanoid showed accumulation pattern of secondary metabolites were mostly correlated with the transcription of their biosynthetic genes. According to the analysis of UDP-dependent glycosyltransferases (UGT) family, several flavonoids were indicated to exist in I. indigotica and further identified by metabolic profile using UPLC/Q-TOF. Moreover, applying transcriptome co-expression analysis, nine new, putative UGTs were suggested as flavonol glycosyltransferases and lignan glycosyltransferases. CONCLUSIONS: This database provides a pool of candidate genes involved in biosynthesis of effective metabolites in I. indigotica. Furthermore, the comprehensive analysis and characterization of the significant pathways are expected to give a better insight regarding the diversity of chemical composition, synthetic characteristics, and the regulatory mechanism which operate in this medical herb.","Chen, Junfeng; Dong, Xin; Li, Qing; Zhou, Xun; Gao, Shouhong; Chen, Ruibing; Sun, Lianna; Zhang, Lei; Chen, Wansheng",BMC Genomics,207,21

Japanese horse chestnut (seed of Aesculus turbinata) contains many saponin mixtures, called escins, and has been used for a long time as a traditional medicinal plant. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies on escins have revealed that acylations at C-21 and C-22 with angeloyl or tigloyl groups were important for their cytotoxic effects. However, the strong cytotoxicity of escins makes them hard to utilize for other diseases and to develop as nutraceuticals. In this research, we investigated whether escin derivatives 1–7 (including new compounds 2, 3, 5 and 6), without the angeloyl or tigloyl groups and with modified glycosidic linkages by hydrolysis, have PEDV inhibitory effects with less cytotoxicity. Compounds 1–7 had no cytotoxicity at 20 μM on VERO cells, while compounds 8–10 showed strong cytotoxicity at similar concentrations on PEDV. Our results suggest that escin derivatives showed strong inhibitory activities on PEDV replication with lowered cytotoxicity. These studies propose a method to utilize Japanese horse chestnut for treating PEDV and to increase the diversity of its bioactive compounds.","Kim, Ji Won; Ha, Thi-Kim-Quy; Cho, Hyomoon; Kim, Eunhee; Shim, Sang Hee; Yang, Jun-Li; Oh, Won Keun",Bioorg Med Chem Lett,207,20

Mindfulness-based programs have been included in the training of health students to help them manage depression, anxiety and stress; however, to date, there has been no review of best practice implementation of mindfulness for health students. The aim of this review was to evaluate the outcomes of mindfulness-based practice for health students to inform best practice with this population. METHODS: A comprehensive search was conducted of three electronic databases (PsychINFO, Medline and Embase) guided by the five-step systematic process for conducting scoping reviews to investigate mindfulness-based intervention programs for students enrolled in a tertiary institution in a health-related course. RESULTS: Twenty-four papers met the eligibility criteria and were reviewed in detail. Findings suggested that mindfulness-based intervention approaches are useful in decreasing depression, anxiety and stress in health students; however, challenges exist in student engagement and retention. Generalization of results was limited by the heterogeneous population, intervention designs and delivery methods, as well as a lack of standardized outcome measures. CONCLUSION: The inclusion of mindfulness-based programs within tertiary curricula can be an effective approach to assist with managing depression, stress and anxiety in health students. Providing academic credit to students, improving translation of skills to working with future clients, and embedding mindfulness-based programs within the curriculum could improve engagement and retention.

However, there is a lack of mental health interventions tailored to domestic violence victims and in the context of COVID-19. In this study, we aim to identify interventions that can improve domestic violence victims’ mental health amid the COVID-19 pandemic to address the research gap. MAIN TEXT: Drawing insights from established COVID-19 review frameworks and a comprehensive review of PubMed literature, we obtained information on interventions that can address domestic violence victims’ mental health challenges amid COVID-19. We identified practical and timely solutions that can be utilized to address mental health challenges domestic violence victims face amid COVID-19, mainly focusing on (1) decreasing victims’ exposure to the abuser and (2) increasing victims’ access to mental health services. CONCLUSION: Domestic violence is a public health crisis that affects all demographics and could result in significant morbidity and mortality. In addition to emphasizing mental health challenges faced by domestic violence victims, multidisciplinary interventions are identified that could provide timely and practical solutions to domestic violence victims amid the pandemic, which range from tailored shelter home strategies, education programs, escape plans, laws and regulations, as well as more technology-based mental health solutions. There is a significant need for more multipronged and multidisciplinary strategies to address domestic violence amid and beyond the pandemic, particularly interventions that could capitalize on the ubiquity and cost-effectiveness of technology-based solutions.","Su, Zhaohui; McDonnell, Dean; Roth, Stephanie; Li, Quanlei; Šegalo, Sabina; Shi, Feng; Wagers, Shelly",Global Health,207,23

For many drug therapies, there is potential to use the respiratory system as an alternative route for drug delivery. Aerosol drug delivery can provide many advantages over conventional therapy. Given that respiratory diseases are the commonest causes of critical illness, use of aerosol therapy to provide high local drug concentrations with minimal systemic side effects makes this route an attractive option. To date, limited evidence has restricted its wider application. The efficacy of aerosol drug therapy depends on drug-related factors (particle size, molecular weight), device factors, patient-related factors (airway anatomy, inhalation patterns) and mechanical ventilation-related factors (humidification, airway). This review identifies the relevant factors which require attention for optimization of aerosol drug delivery that can achieve better drug concentrations at the target sites and potentially improve clinical outcomes.","Dhanani, Jayesh; Fraser, John F.; Chan, Hak-Kim; Rello, Jordi; Cohen, Jeremy; Roberts, Jason A.",Crit Care,207,28

Methods The authors performed a cross-sectional household survey of 348 families in Pittsburgh, PA during the week June 25 to July 2, 2020. Unmet need for child dental care and pandemic-related household job or income loss were assessed using caregiver self-report. Results Caregivers reported that the greatest unmet child health care need during the COVID-19 pandemic was dental care (16%) followed by medical care for a well visit or vaccination (5%). Approximately 40% of caregivers reported job loss or a decrease in household income due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We found a significant association between the probability of unmet child dental care and pandemic-related household job or income loss (P=.022). Losing a job or experiencing a decrease in income due to the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with unmet child dental care (Relative Risk, 1.77; 95% confidence interval, 1.08 to 2.88). Conclusions In our sample, three times as many households reported unmet dental care for a child compared to unmet medical care. Unmet child dental care was more common in households where pandemic-related job or income loss occurred. Practical Implications If unmet dental care continues as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, non-traditional strategies for delivering dental care can be considered to improve access to dental care for children, such as teledentistry and oral health prevention services in primary care settings.","Burgette, Jacqueline M.; Weyant, Robert J.; Ettinger, Anna; Miller, Elizabeth; Ray, Kristin N.",J Am Dent Assoc,207,10

METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted at the clinical chemistry laboratory at the Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH), Karachi Pakistan. Data for test volumes was extracted from the Integrated Laboratory Management System (ILMS) for the following tumor markers: CA19 Carbohydrate Antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9), Calcitonin, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA), from 2017 to 2020. Data from January 1st, 2017 till December 31st, 2019 was recorded and compared with the test volume data from January 1st, 2020 till December 31st, 2020. Number of tests performed in the prior 3 years were compared with tests performed in 2020, specifically looking at changes during the lockdown period in 2020 (1st March – 9 th April) and compared with the same period in preceding years. RESULTS: During the four-year period, a total of 6,530 tests were performed for CA19-9, 893 for Calcitonin, and 54,769 for PSA. Year 2019 recorded the highest volume for all 3 tests with test volumes increasing continuously from 2017 to 2019. Number of tests performed decreased throughout the year 2020 for Calcitonin and PSA, whereas volume of tests for CA19-9 only reduced during the lockdown period while increased in the non-lockdown period as compared to previous years. Highest percent decline during the 2020 lockdown period was seen for Calcitonin (-62.5%), followed by PSA (-51.8%) and CA19-9 (-19%). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the amount of CA19-9, Calcitonin, and PSA tests performed in Karachi, Pakistan has drastically reduced due to the lockdown that was mandated due to the COVID-19 outbreak.

METHODS: This was a phase II randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study with 2:1 random parallel group assignment to daily extended-release oral lorcaserin 20 mg versus placebo (clinicaltrials.gov identifier-NCT03192995). Twenty-two of a planned 45 cisgender MSM with CUD were enrolled and had weekly follow-up visits during a 12-week treatment period, with substance use counseling, urine specimen collection, and completion of audio-computer assisted self-interview (ACASI) behavioral risk assessments. Adherence was measured by medication event monitoring systems (MEMS) caps and self-report. This study was terminated early because of an FDA safety alert for lorcaserin’s long-term use. RESULTS: Eighty-six percent completed the trial, with 82% of weekly study follow-up visits completed. Adherence was 55.3% (lorcaserin 51.6% vs. placebo 66.2%) by MEMS cap and 56.9% (56.5% vs. placebo 57.9%) by self-report and did not differ significantly by treatment assignment. Intention-to-treat analyses (ITT) did not show differences in cocaine positivity by urine screen between the lorcaserin and placebo groups by 12 week follow-up (incidence risk ratio [IRR]: 0.96; 95%CI = 0.24–3.82, P = 0.95). However, self-reported cocaine use in timeline follow-back declined more significantly in the lorcaserin group compared to placebo (IRR: 0.66; 95%CI = 0.49–0.88; P = 0.004). CONCLUSION: We found that it is feasible, acceptable, and tolerable to conduct a placebo-controlled pharmacologic trial for MSM with CUD who are actively using cocaine. Lorcaserin was not associated with significant reductions in cocaine use by urine testing, but was associated with significant reductions in self-reported cocaine use. Future research may be needed to continue to explore the potential utility of 5-HT(2c)R agonists.","Santos, Glenn-Milo; Ikeda, Janet; Coffin, Phillip; Walker, John E.; Matheson, Tim; McLaughlin, Matthew; Jain, Jennifer; Vittinghoff, Eric; Batki, Steven L.",PLoS One,207,29

In recent years, there have been many in-depth studies on mammalian lncRNAs, but the relevant studies in fish are very limited. Meanwhile, since lncRNAs are not conserved among species, it is difficult to apply the existing results directly to unstudied species. RESULTS: To obtain the information of lncRNAs in Megalobrama amblycephala, one of the most economically important freshwater fish in China, also to better understand the biological significance of lncRNAs in the immunity system, the fish liver at 0, 4, 12, 24, and 72 h post Aeromonas hydrophila infection (hpi) were obtained for lncRNA-sequencing (lncRNA-seq). A total of 14,849 lncRNAs were identified, and 2196 lncRNAs showed significant differences at different time points post A. hydrophila infection. Gene Ontology (GO) annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses showed that the target genes of the differentially expressed lncRNAs were enriched in several pathways related to immune such as apoptosis, inflammation, and immune response. Time-specific modules were then identified, using weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA), and 28 modules significantly correlated with different time point after infection were found. Furthermore, four immune-related genes and six lncRNAs in the time-specific modules were subsequently verified by RT-qPCR. CONCLUSIONS: The above findings reveal the discovery of widespread differentially expressed lncRNAs in the M. amblycephala liver post A. hydrophila infection, suggesting that lncRNAs might participate in the regulation of host response to bacterial infection, enriching the information of lncRNAs in teleost and providing a resources basis for further studies on the immune function of lncRNAs.

Seizure-related attendances decreased across all pediatric age-groups in 2020 (RR 0.379, 95% CI 0.245-0.588), with a disproportionately large decrease in the 0-6 years age group (RR 0.303, 95% CI 0.174-0.526) compared with the 7-18 years age group (RR 0.534, 95% CI 0.393-0.719). Decrease in RTI-related A&E attendances was also more drastic in the 0-6 age group. The two time trends are congruent in the 0-6 years but not the 7-18 years age group. Such a trend is suggestive of the usefulness of infection control measures in seizure prevention, especially amongst young children.","Annie Chiu, Ting Gee; Leung, William CY.; Zhang, Qiqi; Lau, Eric HY.; Ho, Ryan Wui-hang; Sophelia Chan, Hoi-Shan; Chang, Richard Shek-kwan",J Formos Med Assoc,207,16

Caves and other subterranean habitats fulfill the requirements of experimental model systems to address general questions in ecology and evolution. Yet, the harsh working conditions of these environments and the uniqueness of the subterranean organisms have challenged most attempts to pursuit standardized research. 2. Two main obstacles have synergistically hampered previous attempts. First, there is a habitat impediment related to the objective difficulties of exploring subterranean habitats and our inability to access the network of fissures that represents the elective habitat for the so‐called “cave species.” Second, there is a biological impediment illustrated by the rarity of most subterranean species and their low physiological tolerance, often limiting sample size and complicating laboratory experiments. 3. We explore the advantages and disadvantages of four general experimental setups (in situ, quasi in situ, ex situ, and in silico) in the light of habitat and biological impediments. We also discuss the potential of indirect approaches to research. Furthermore, using bibliometric data, we provide a quantitative overview of the model organisms that scientists have exploited in the study of subterranean life. 4. Our over‐arching goal is to promote caves as model systems where one can perform standardized scientific research. This is important not only to achieve an in‐depth understanding of the functioning of subterranean ecosystems but also to fully exploit their long‐discussed potential in addressing general scientific questions with implications beyond the boundaries of this discipline.","Mammola, Stefano; Lunghi, Enrico; Bilandžija, Helena; Cardoso, Pedro; Grimm, Volker; Schmidt, Susanne I.; Hesselberg, Thomas; Martínez, Alejandro",Ecol Evol,207,16

Underneath the viral envelope of influenza virus, matrix protein 1 (M1) forms an oligomeric layer critical for particle stability and pH-dependent RNA genome release. However, high-resolution structures of full-length monomeric M1 and the matrix layer have not been available, impeding antiviral targeting and understanding of the pH-dependent transitions involved in cell entry. Here, purification and extensive mutagenesis revealed protein–protein interfaces required for the formation of multilayered helical M1 oligomers similar to those observed in virions exposed to the low pH of cell entry. However, single-layered helical oligomers with biochemical and ultrastructural similarity to those found in infectious virions before cell entry were observed upon mutation of a single amino acid. The highly ordered structure of the single-layered oligomers and their likeness to the matrix layer of intact virions prompted structural analysis by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The resulting 3.4-Å–resolution structure revealed the molecular details of M1 folding and its organization within the single-shelled matrix. The solution of the full-length M1 structure, the identification of critical assembly interfaces, and the development of M1 assembly assays with purified proteins are crucial advances for antiviral targeting of influenza viruses.","Selzer, Lisa; Su, Zhaoming; Pintilie, Grigore D.; Chiu, Wah; Kirkegaard, Karla",PLoS Biol,207,25

However, children seem to be spared in the epidemic as very small percentage worldwide being ill. The protection of children and neonates suggests the involvement of a specific component of adaptive immunity present at early development. Native immunoglobulin belonging to the class of IgM is abundantly present in neonates and children and is known for its recognition of self- and altered self-antigens. Native IgM may be able to neutralize virus by the recognition of endogenous “danger signal” encoded in the viral envelope and originally imprinted in the membranes of infected and stressed cells. Noteworthy, thrombosis and vasculitis, two symptoms in severely affected adult and pediatric patients are shared between COVID-19 and patients with Behcet’s disease, an autoimmune disorder exhibiting a region-specific prevalence in countries of the former silk road. Molecular mechanisms and clinical indicators suggest reactive oxygen species as trigger factor for severe progression of COVID-19 and establish a link to the innate immune defense against bacteria. The selective pressure exerted by bacterial pathogens may have shaped the genetics of inhabitants at this ancient trade route in favor of bacterial defense, to the detriment of severe COVID-19 progression in the 21th century.","Massalska, Magdalena Anna; Gober, Hans-Jürgen",Front Immunol,207,24

The mean duration of wearing personal protective equipment was 194.17 min (standard deviation: 3.71). Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that the duration of wearing personal protective equipment was significantly associated with the presence of a chronic disease, working hours when feeling discomfort, lack of patient cooperation and subsequent psychological pressure, prolonged continuous wearing of personal protective equipment, feeling anxious about physical strength, and the presence of fatigue when wearing personal protective equipment. These factors should be considered by practicing healthcare professionals and in future studies that examine the optimal duration of wearing personal protective equipment.","Li, Fanglin; Jiang, Tongtong; Shi, Tieying; Liu, Yongning; Liu, Xiumei; Xu, Guojun; Liu, Yu; Shi, Yajie",Nurs Health Sci,207,20

However, by day 12 pi, T cell infiltration into the CNS of infected CCR5−/− and CCR5+/+ mice was similar and both strains exhibited comparable viral titers, indicating that CCR5 expression is not essential for host defense. Following MHV infection of CCR5+/+ mice, greater than 50% of cells expressing CCR5 antigen were activated macrophage/microglia (determined by F4/80 antigen expression). In addition, infected CCR5−/− mice exhibited reduced (P ≤ 0.02) macrophage (CD45highF4/80+) infiltration, which correlated with a significant reduction (P ≤ 0.001) in the severity of demyelination compared to CCR5+/+ mice.

Photoreceptors in the outer retina rely on nutrient support from the neighboring retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), a monolayer of epithelial cells that separate the retina and choroidal blood supply. RPE dysfunction or cell death can result in photoreceptor degeneration, leading to blindness in retinal degenerative diseases including some inherited retinal degenerations and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). In addition to having ready access to rich nutrients from blood, the RPE is also supplied with lactate from adjacent photoreceptors. Moreover, RPE can phagocytose lipid-rich outer segments for degradation and recycling on a daily basis. Recent studies show RPE cells prefer proline as a major metabolic substrate, and they are highly enriched for the proline transporter, SLC6A20. In contrast, dysfunctional or poorly differentiated RPE fails to utilize proline. RPE uses proline to fuel mitochondrial metabolism, synthesize amino acids, build the extracellular matrix, fight against oxidative stress, and sustain differentiation. Remarkably, the neural retina rarely imports proline directly, but it uptakes and utilizes intermediates and amino acids derived from proline catabolism in the RPE. Mutations of genes in proline metabolism are associated with retinal degenerative diseases, and proline supplementation is reported to improve RPE-initiated vision loss. This review will cover proline metabolism in RPE and highlight the importance of proline transport and utilization in maintaining retinal metabolism and health.","Du, Jianhai; Zhu, Siyan; Lim, Rayne R.; Chao, Jennifer R.",Amino Acids,207,1

Social distancing measures were needed to reduce transmission, and lockdown included restricted access to healthcare facilities. The impact of COVID-19 on transplant recipients is unknown but, considering their immunosuppression status and associated comorbidities, they should be considered a high risk population. Methods A kidney transplant center in Central Italy implemented a strategy to maintain follow-up of kidney transplant recipients by phone and e-mail during lockdown. Telephone interviews were used administer a clinical questionnaire to patients, and e-mail was used to receive the results of diagnostic tests conducted in outpatient settings. Results From March 17 to April 23, 2020, a total of 143 kidney transplant recipients were contacted. Twenty-eight patients needed in-hospital consultation for problems unrelated to COVID-19, 3 of whom needed hospitalization. Eleven patients were managed at home for mild urinary or respiratory diseases, and one was referred to the hematologist. We identified 2 suspected cases of COVID-19 infection, and referred them to hospital care. Immunosuppressive therapy was modulated, and intravenous corticosteroids and potentially effective antiviral therapy were administered, with a favorable outcome.

This study was conducted to find out domestic violence prevalence and coping strategies among married adults during lockdown due to COVID-19 in India. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among married men and women in the month of April 2020. Data regarding socio-demographic profile, domestic violence, and coping strategies used during lockdown were collected thorough Google Forms. A total of 97.9% of the forms were completely filled by the respondents. A descriptive analysis was done. RESULTS: Of 94 study participants, approximately 7.4% (n = 7) had faced domestic violence during lockdown. Of these 7 participants, approximately 85.7% (n = 6) reported increased frequency of domestic violence during lockdown. Approximately half of the victims chose to ignore it (57.1%; n = 4) or used yoga/meditation (42.9%; n = 3) to cope. CONCLUSIONS: With approximately 7.4% study participants facing domestic violence during lockdown, it is necessary to study its detailed epidemiology in pandemics so that interventions like helpline numbers, screening of patients during tele-consultation, etc., which can be delivered even during lockdown with the help of health-care and frontline workers could be devised to address this problem.","Sharma, Priyanka; Khokhar, Anita",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,207,26

Similarly, several envelope proteins of endogenous retroviruses in human and other mammalian animal genomes (such as syncytin-1 and 2 in human, syncytin-A and B in mouse) were identified and shown to be functional in induction of cell–cell fusion involved in placental development. ZFERV envelope protein (Env) gene appears to be also functional in vivo because it is expressible. After sequence alignment, we found ZFERV Env shares similar structural profiles with syncytin and other type I viral envelopes, especially in the regions of N- and C-terminal heptad repeats (NHR and CHR) which were crucial for membrane fusion. We expressed the regions of N + C protein in the ZFERV Env (residues 459–567, including predicted NHR and CHR) to characterize the fusion core structure. We found N + C protein could form a stable coiled-coil trimer that consists of three helical NHR regions forming a central trimeric core, and three helical CHR regions packing into the grooves on the surface of the central core. The structural characterization of the fusion core revealed the possible mechanism of fusion mediated by ZFERV Env. These results gave comprehensive explanation of how the ancient virus infects the zebrafish and integrates into the genome million years ago, and showed a rational clue for discovery of physiological significance (e.g., medicate cell–cell fusion).","Shi, Jian; Zhang, Huaidong; Gong, Rui; Xiao, Gengfu",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,207,33

The aim of this study was to evaluate how people with epilepsy (PWE) in Brazil is dealing with the pandemic, in relation to seizure frequency, access to antiseizure medicines (ASM), medical follow-up, and well-being. METHODS: An online questionnaire survey among PWE (group 1) and caregivers (group 2) was applied in the social networks of the Brazilian Association of Epilepsy, the official Brazilian chapter of the International Bureau for Epilepsy. The questionnaire was composed of 46 generic questions in four areas, namely, demographics and baseline clinical data as well as epilepsy and quality-of-life impact by COVID-19 pandemic based on the domains of the abbreviated World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF) instrument. RESULTS: The questionnaire was answered by 464 participants including 380 (81.9%) PWE (78.7% female; age 34.3 yrs.; ±9.76) and 84 (18.1%) caregivers (patients’ age 14.1 yrs.; ±10.30). During the COVID-19 pandemic, 36.8% of PWE and 36.4% of caregivers reported difficulties in accessing the epilepsy healthcare provider, and visits occurred normally only in 29.7% of PWE and in 34.5% of the caregiveŕs group. Telehealth was not provided for 66.6% of group 1 and for 58.5% of group 2. Lack of availability of ASM was reported by 21.9% of PWE and 28.0% of caregivers in public dispensing units and by 19.2% and 17.8%, respectively, in private pharmacies. Increase in seizures during pandemic was mentioned by 26.3% and 27.9% of groups 1 and 2, respectively. Patients who had increase in seizure frequency had more frequently reported problems with treatment and in quality-of-life concepts. Fear of having a more severe COVID-19 presentation because of epilepsy was reported by 74.5% of PWE and by 89.8% of caregivers. Dissatisfaction with current health status was reported by 36.7% and 38.1% in groups 1 and 2, respectively, and that the support from others has decreased (56.1% and 66.1%, in groups 1 and 2) during the pandemic. The factors with higher Odds Ratio of increase in seizure frequency during pandemic were age >41 yrs., treatment in public healthcare system, drug-resistant epilepsy, adversities in getting ASM in public dispensing units, difficulties with prescription renewals, current financial problems and belief that epilepsy or ASM are risk factors for contracting COVID-19. CONCLUSION: During COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil, PWE and caregivers reported increase in seizures in one-fourth of the patients and several difficulties, namely problems in accessing the healthcare system including ASM dispensation, telehealth, and fear of having a more severe COVID-19 because of epilepsy. There were also physical, psychological, and social concerns which affected quality-of-life-related aspects in this population. These facts may increase treatment gap in epilepsy in Brazil as well in other developing countries.","Guilhoto, Laura Maria; Mosini, Amanda Cristina; Susemihl, Maria Alice; Pinto, Lécio Figueira",Epilepsy Behav,207,1

The theoretical model of the study was based on Martin Seligman’s positive psychology and PERMA theory and Paul Wong’s Existential Positive Psychology 2.0 Theory, which postulates that negative experiences contribute to well-being and personal growth. The static approach was complemented by exploring the mediating role of psychological flexibility (defined as acceptance and action in the current situation) in the relationship between negative emotions and well-being. The data were collected during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic from 277 participants (221 women), aged M = 33.83, SD = 12.77. The results confirmed that negative emotions correlated negatively with various domains of well-being (PERM), except for accomplishment (completing tasks and fulfill daily responsibilities). Moreover, negative emotions were related to the general well-being through psychological flexibility in that higher depression, anxiety, and stress were associated with lower psychological flexibility, which decreased general well-being. Finally, negative emotions were shown to be beneficial, having an adaptive effect that allows individuals to maintain their ability to cope with the situation, reach goals, and fulfill daily duties and responsibilities despite critical, stressful situation (like the COVID-19 pandemic) that limit their psychological flexibility. This observation confirmed the positive potential of negative aspects of life postulated within Existential Positive Psychology.","Wąsowicz, Grażyna; Mizak, Szymon; Krawiec, Jakub; Białaszek, Wojciech",Front Psychol,207,16

The causal impact of these risk factors is unknown at present. METHODS: We conducted multivariable logistic regression to evaluate the observational associations between obesity traits (body mass index [BMI], waist circumference [WC]), quantitative cardiometabolic parameters (systolic blood pressure [SBP], serum glucose, serum glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c], low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol and triglycerides [TG]) and SARS-CoV-2 positivity in the UK Biobank cohort. One-sample MR was performed by using the genetic risk scores of obesity and cardiometabolic traits constructed from independent datasets and the genotype and phenotype data from the UK Biobank. Two-sample MR was performed using the summary statistics from COVID-19 host genetics initiative. Cox proportional hazard models were fitted to assess the risk conferred by different genetic quintiles of causative exposure traits. RESULTS: The study comprised 1,211 European participants who were tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and 387,079 participants who were either untested or tested negative between 16 March 2020 to 31 May 2020. Observationally, higher BMI, WC, HbA1c and lower HDL-cholesterol were associated with higher odds of COVID-19 infection. One-sample MR analyses found causal associations between higher genetically determined BMI and LDL cholesterol and increased risk of COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR]: 1.15, confidence interval [CI]: 1.05–1.26 and OR: 1.58, CI: 1.21–2.06, per 1 standard deviation increment in BMI and LDL cholesterol respectively). Two-sample MR produced concordant results. Cox models indicated that individuals in the higher genetic risk score quintiles of BMI and LDL were more predisposed to COVID-19 (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.24, CI: 1.03–1.49 and HR: 1.37, CI: 1.14–1.65, for the top vs the bottom quintile for BMI and LDL cholesterol, respectively). CONCLUSION: We identified causal associations between BMI, LDL cholesterol and susceptibility to COVID-19. In particular, individuals in higher genetic risk categories were predisposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection. These findings support the integration of BMI into the risk assessment of COVID-19 and allude to a potential role of lipid modification in the prevention and treatment.","Aung, Nay; Khanji, Mohammed Y.; Munroe, Patricia B.; Petersen, Steffen E.",Front Genet,207,1

Though acute respiratory coronavirus (SARS-COV2) that leads to COVID-19 infects people of all ages, severe symptoms and mortality occur disproportionately in older adults. Geroscience interventions that target biological aging could decrease risk across multiple age-related diseases and improve outcomes in response to infectious disease. This offers hope for a new host-directed therapeutic approach that could (i) improve outcomes following exposure or shorten treatment regimens; (ii) reduce the chronic pathology associated with the infectious disease and subsequent comorbidity, frailty, and disability; and (iii) promote development of immunological memory that protects against relapse or improves response to vaccination. We review the possibility of this approach by examining available evidence in metformin: a generic drug with a proven safety record that will be used in a large-scale multicenter clinical trial. Though rigorous translational research and clinical trials are needed to test this empirically, metformin may improve host immune defenses and confer protection against long-term health consequences of infectious disease, age-related chronic diseases, and geriatric syndromes.","Justice, Jamie N.; Gubbi, Sriram; Kulkarni, Ameya S.; Bartley, Jenna M.; Kuchel, George A.; Barzilai, Nir",GeroScience,207,16

Methods: In this cross-sectional controlled cohort study, 500 patients who presented with symptoms of a common cold to a corona testing center and fulfilled corona testing criteria, completed a standardized diagnostic questionnaire which included the patients main symptoms, time course and an additional self-assessment of the patients current smell, taste function and nasal breathing compared to the level before onset of symptoms. Results: Out of the 500 patients, 69 presented with olfactory loss. Twenty-two of them subsequently tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Only twelve out of the patients without olfactory loss tested positive, resulting in a frequency of 64.7% for the symptom sudden smell loss in COVID-19 patients. Compared to COVID-19 patients without smell loss, they were significantly younger and less severely affected. Changes in nasal airflow were significantly more pronounced in SARS-CoV-2 negative patients with olfactory complaints compared to the patients with smell loss who were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. By excluding patients with a blocked nose, the symptom sudden smell loss can be attested a high specificity (97%) and a sensitivity of 65% with a PPV of 63% and NPV of 97% for COVID-19. Conclusion: Considering the high frequency of smell loss in non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients, acute olfactory impairment should be included in the WHO symptoms list and should be recognized as an early symptom of the disease. In contrast to other acute viral smell impairment, COVID-19 associated smell loss seems to be only rarely accompanied by a severely blocked nose.","Haehner, A.; Draf, J.; Draeger, S.; de With, K.; Hummel, T.",,207,26

METHODS: A retrospective case series was performed in 23 eyes from 21 patients who underwent OCTA of neovascular complexes (NVCs) due to PDR. Eyes were imaged with the DRI Triton swept-source OCTA, Avanti RTVue XR or Cirrus HD-OCT 5000 as part of routine clinical examination. Segmentation was adjusted to include vasculature between the vitreous cavity and the internal limiting membrane (ILM). The presence of NVCs was confirmed by clinical examination and multimodal imaging such as color or red-free fundus photography, fluorescein angiography, multicolor imaging or near-infrared reflectance. RESULTS: Thirty-five NVCs were imaged, of which, 34% were neovascularization of the disc (NVD) and 66% were neovascularization elsewhere (NVE). On structural OCT B-scans, NVE appeared as medium to highly reflective tissue that breached the ILM, while NVD showed highly reflective tissue protruding from the disc in a sea fan configuration. Flow signal was seen on OCTA in all cases of NVE and in 67% of NVD lesions. Areas with minimal or absent retinal flow signal identified retinal nonperfusion areas and were found adjacent to 87% of NVE. Intraretinal microvascular abnormalities (IRMAs) were noted next to 70% of NVE. Absent flow signal was seen in 4 NVD cases showing posterior shadowing and were considered inactive. CONCLUSION: OCTA appears useful for imaging NVCs, IRMAs, and retinal nonperfusion areas in eyes with diabetic retinopathy. This imaging modality enables noninvasive screening and monitoring of PDR and can obviate the need for additional testing in certain clinical settings.","Vaz-Pereira, Sara; Silva, João Jesus; Freund, K Bailey; Engelbert, Michael",Clin Ophthalmol,207,23

Of the numerous publications and review articles focusing on heparanase, we have selected those that best reflect the progression in the field as well as those we regard important accomplishments with preference to studies performed by scientists and groups that contributed to this book. Apart from a general ‘introduction’ and ‘concluding remarks’, the abstracts of these studies are presented essentially as published along the years. We apologize for not being objective and not being able to include some of the most relevant abstracts and references, due to space limitation. Heparanase research can be divided into two eras. The first, initiated around 1975, dealt with identifying the enzyme, establishing the relevant assay systems and investigating its biological activities and significance in cancer and other pathologies. Studies performed during the first area are briefly introduced in a layman style followed by the relevant abstracts presented chronologically, essentially as appears in PubMed. The second era started in 1999 when the heparanase gene was independently cloned by 4 research groups [1–4]. As expected, cloning of the heparanase gene boosted heparanase research by virtue of the readily available recombinant enzyme, molecular probes, and anti-heparanase antibodies. Studies performed during the second area are briefly introduced followed by selected abstracts of key findings, arranged according to specific topics.","Vlodavsky, Israel; Ilan, Neta; Sanderson, Ralph D.",Heparanase,207,1

An elective HPS course on the philosophy of scientific experimentation for young scientists and graduate students of natural science is presented. The course bears a pragmatic character, and its main aims include the development of critical thinking (CT), familiarization with philosophical problems in the relevant areas of knowledge, and the cultivation of a taste for reflective, critical analysis, both individual and group based, which contributes to a deeper understanding of the features of scientific practice in the context of modern complex group cooperation. Students are offered a classical HPS program that included debates on the relationship between empiricism and rationalism, the role of Kant’s transcendental philosophy, modern topics associated with the practical success of rationalism in the emergence of modern natural science, and the theory-ladenness of experimentation. Particular attention during the course is paid to the problems of megascience, the inclusion of which is justified by the specifics of the students’ engagement with science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Emphasis is placed on the structure and typology of the collective subject in the modern educational process as well as in experimental practice. Lessons on the methodology of expert text analysis (META), which are aimed at the development of critical thinking skills and the creation of an interdisciplinary discussion space, are included in the course and relied on the example of the history and philosophy of high-energy physics to motivate professional reflection. META classes included in the course prepare graduate students for teamwork in big science, proto-megascience, and megascience. The course offers practical recommendations that could be applied to students’ own research and could be useful for practitioners.","Pronskikh, Vitaly; Sorina, Galina V.",Sci Educ (Dordr),207,5

More than two‐thirds of emerging, or re‐emerging, infectious diseases are thought to originate in wildlife. Despite this, co‐ordinated surveillance schemes are rare, and most efforts at disease control operate at the level of crisis management. This review examines the pathways linking zoonoses in wildlife with infection in other hosts, using examples from a range of key zoonoses, including European bat lyssaviruses and bovine tuberculosis. Ecologically based control, including the management of conditions leading to spill‐overs into target host populations, is likely to be more effective and sustainable than simple reductions in wildlife populations alone.","Mathews, Fiona",Adv Parasitol,207,9

Methods: The published COVID-19 reinfection cases were reviewed and the relevant data were extracted, including the baseline characteristics of patients, the results of antibody tests, and the whole-genome sequencing results of the viral strains. Results: We reviewed 29 reinfection cases in 20 reports from 14 countries. The age of re-infected patients ranged from 21 to 90 years (median 53 years), and there was no significant difference in gender distribution. Among the 29 patients, 11 were health care workers, 6 received immunosuppressive drugs (including glucocorticoids), 17 presented more severe symptoms than their primary infections and 5 (all aged over 80 years) died. The interval of the two infections was usually less than 60 days when the patients were infected by the same viral strain,while the interval was much longer (median 78.5 days) when the patients were infected by different viral strains. Nine patients had negative antibody test results or low antibody titers when the reinfections were confirmed, and 5 of them had negative antibody test results even during the initial infection. Conclusions: Virus-specific antibodies had a protective effect against COVID-19 reinfection for the majority of the population, however, this effect may decrease over time. Occupational exposure, low levels of antibodies, or an inability to produce antibodies may be the main risk factors for reinfection. Advanced age was a major risk factor for a poor prognosis. Effective personal prevention and social distancing were still essential for the prevention of reinfection.","Long, Q Y; Zheng, Y L; Gao, Z C",Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases,207,9

The nucleoside analogue N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC), also known as EIDD-1931, interferes with SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell culture. It is the active metabolite of the prodrug Molnupiravir (MK-4482), which is currently being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19 in advanced clinical studies. Meanwhile, inhibitors of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), by reducing the cellular synthesis of pyrimidines, counteract virus replication and are also being clinically evaluated for COVID-19 therapy. Here we show that the combination of NHC and DHODH inhibitors such as teriflunomide, IMU-838/vidofludimus, and BAY2402234, strongly synergizes to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. While single drug treatment only mildly impaired virus replication, combination treatments reduced virus yields by at least two orders of magnitude. We determined this by RT-PCR, TCID50, immunoblot and immunofluorescence assays in Vero E6 and Calu-3 cells infected with wildtype and the Alpha and Beta variants of SARS-CoV-2. We propose that the lack of available pyrimidine nucleotides upon DHODH inhibition increases the incorporation of NHC in nascent viral RNA, thus precluding the correct synthesis of the viral genome in subsequent rounds of replication, thereby inhibiting the production of replication competent virus particles. This concept was further supported by the rescue of replicating virus after addition of pyrimidine nucleosides to the media. Based on our results, we suggest combining these drug candidates, which are currently both tested in clinical studies, to counteract the replication of SARS-CoV-2, the progression of COVID-19, and the transmission of the disease within the population. SIGNIFICANCE The strong synergy displayed by DHODH inhibitors and the active compound of Molnupiravir might enable lower concentrations of each drug to antagonize virus replication, with less toxicity. Both Molnupiravir and DHODH inhibitors are currently being tested in advanced clinical trials or are FDA-approved for different purposes, raising the perspective of rapidly testing their combinatory efficacy in clinical studies. Molnupiravir is currently a promising candidate for treating early stages of COVID-19, under phase II/III clinical evaluation. However, like Remdesivir, it appears only moderately useful in treating severe COVID-19. Since the combination inhibits virus replication far more strongly, and since DHODH inhibitors may also suppress excessive immune responses, the combined clinical application bears the potential of alleviating the disease burden even at later stages.","Stegmann, Kim M.; Dickmanns, Antje; Heinen, Natalie; Groß, Uwe; Görlich, Dirk; Pfaender, Stephanie; Dobbelstein, Matthias",bioRxiv,207,20

METHODS: The Influenza Incidence Surveillance Project conducts ILI surveillance in 3 primary care clinics in New York City, and MoSAIC conducts community‐based ILI/ARI surveillance through text messaging among a cohort of New York City residents. Both systems obtain respiratory specimens from participants with ILI/ARI and test for multiple pathogens. We conducted a retrospective review of ILI cases in IISP and MoSAIC from January 2013 to May 2015 with descriptive analyses of clinical and laboratory data. RESULTS: Five‐hundred twelve MoSAIC and 669 IISP participants met an ILI criteria (fever with cough or sore throat) and were included. Forty percent of MoSAIC participants sought care; the majority primary care. Pathogens were detected in 63% of MoSAIC and 70% of IISP cases. The relative distribution of influenza and other respiratory viruses detected was similar; however, there were statistically significant differences in the frequency that were not explained by care seeking.

Ideally, samples from the lower respiratory tract are collected, but they are difficult to obtain. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we compared the diagnostic yield in sputum and oropharyngeal samples (OPS) for the detection of respiratory pathogens in patients with community‐acquired pneumonia (CAP), with the objective to optimize our diagnostic testing algorithm. METHODS: Matched sputum samples, OPS, blood cultures, serum, and urine samples were taken from patients (>18 years) with CAP and tested for the presence of possible respiratory pathogens using bacterial cultures, PCR for 17 viruses and five bacteria and urinary antigen testing. RESULTS: When using only conventional methods, that is, blood cultures, sputum culture, urinary antigen tests, a pathogen was detected in 49·6% of patients (n = 57). Adding molecular detection assays increased the yield to 80%. A pathogen was detected in 77 of the 115 patients in OPS or sputum samples by PCR. The sensitivity of the OPS was lower than that of the sputum samples (57% versus 74%). In particular, bacterial pathogens were more often detected in sputum samples. The sensitivity of OPS for the detection of most viruses was higher than in sputum samples (72% versus 66%), except for human rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus. CONCLUSION: Addition of PCR on both OPS and sputum samples significantly increased the diagnostic yield. For molecular detection of bacterial pathogens, a sputum sample is imperative, but for detection of most viral pathogens, an OPS is sufficient.","Huijskens, Elisabeth G. W.; Rossen, John W.

CCP with a signal-to-cutoff ratio of ≥12 using the Ortho VITROS severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) immunoglobulin G (IgG) test (OVSARS2IgG) is permitted to be labeled “high titer.” Little is known about the relationship between OVSARS2IgG ratio and neutralizing capacity of plasma/sera against genuine SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Nine hundred eighty-one samples from 196 repeat CCP donors 0–119 days post–initial donation (DPID) were analyzed. Neutralizing capacity was assessed for 50% (PRNT(50)) and 90% (PRNT(90)) reduction of infectious virus using the gold standard plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). A subset of 91 donations was evaluated by OVSARS2IgG and compared to PRNT titers for diagnostic accuracy. RESULTS: Of donations, 32.7%/79.5% (PRNT(90)/PRNT(50)) met a 1:80 titer initially but only 14.0%/48.8% (PRNT(90)/PRNT(50)) met this cutoff ≥85 DPID. Correlation of OVSARS2IgG results to neutralizing capacity allowed extrapolation to CCP therapy results. CCP with OVSARS2IgG ratios equivalent to a therapeutically beneficial group had neutralizing titers of ≥1:640 (PRNT(50)) and/or ≥1:80 (PRNT(90)). Specificity and positive predictive value of the OVSARS2IgG for qualifying highly neutralizing CCP was optimal using ratios significantly greater than the FDA cutoff.

DESIGN: Population based cohort study. SETTING: US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (US NHANES, 1988-94 and 1999-2014) and UK Biobank. PARTICIPANTS: 44 462 US adults aged 20 years or older and 399 537 UK adults aged 37-73 years. EXPOSURES: SES was derived by latent class analysis using family income, occupation or employment status, education level, and health insurance (US NHANES only), and three levels (low, medium, and high) were defined according to item response probabilities. A healthy lifestyle score was constructed using information on never smoking, no heavy alcohol consumption (women ≤1 drink/day; men ≤2 drinks/day; one drink contains 14 g of ethanol in the US and 8 g in the UK), top third of physical activity, and higher dietary quality. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All cause mortality was the primary outcome in both studies, and CVD mortality and morbidity in UK Biobank, which were obtained through linkage to registries. RESULTS: US NHANES documented 8906 deaths over a mean follow-up of 11.2 years, and UK Biobank documented 22 309 deaths and 6903 incident CVD cases over a mean follow-up of 8.8-11.0 years. Among adults of low SES, age adjusted risk of death was 22.5 (95% confidence interval 21.7 to 23.3) and 7.4 (7.3 to 7.6) per 1000 person years in US NHANES and UK Biobank, respectively, and age adjusted risk of CVD was 2.5 (2.4 to 2.6) per 1000 person years in UK Biobank. The corresponding risks among adults of high SES were 11.4 (10.6 to 12.1), 3.3 (3.1 to 3.5), and 1.4 (1.3 to 1.5) per 1000 person years. Compared with adults of high SES, those of low SES had higher risks of all cause mortality (hazard ratio 2.13, 95% confidence interval 1.90 to 2.38 in US NHANES; 1.96, 1.87 to 2.06 in UK Biobank), CVD mortality (2.25, 2.00 to 2.53), and incident CVD (1.65, 1.52 to 1.79) in UK Biobank, and the proportions mediated by lifestyle were 12.3% (10.7% to 13.9%), 4.0% (3.5% to 4.4%), 3.0% (2.5% to 3.6%), and 3.7% (3.1% to 4.5%), respectively. No significant interaction was observed between lifestyle and SES in US NHANES, whereas associations between lifestyle and outcomes were stronger among those of low SES in UK Biobank. Compared with adults of high SES and three or four healthy lifestyle factors, those with low SES and no or one healthy lifestyle factor had higher risks of all cause mortality (3.53, 3.01 to 4.14 in US NHANES; 2.65, 2.39 to 2.94 in UK Biobank), CVD mortality (2.65, 2.09 to 3.38), and incident CVD (2.09, 1.78 to 2.46) in UK Biobank. CONCLUSIONS: Unhealthy lifestyles mediated a small proportion of the socioeconomic inequity in health in both US and UK adults; therefore, healthy lifestyle promotion alone might not substantially reduce the socioeconomic inequity in health, and other measures tackling social determinants of health are warranted. Nevertheless, healthy lifestyles were associated with lower mortality and CVD risk in different SES subgroups, supporting an important role of healthy lifestyles in reducing disease burden.","Zhang, Yan-Bo; Chen, Chen; Pan, Xiong-Fei; Guo, Jingyu; Li, Yanping; Franco, Oscar H; Liu, Gang; Pan, An",BMJ,207,15

Exposure of larvae to SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) receptor binding domain (RBD) recombinant protein was sufficient to elevate larval heart rate and treatment with captopril, an ACE inhibitor, reverted this effect. Intranasal administration of SARS-CoV-2 S RBD in adult zebrafish recombinant protein caused severe olfactory and mild renal histopathology. Zebrafish intranasally treated with SARS-CoV-2 S RBD became hyposmic within minutes and completely anosmic by 1 day to a broad-spectrum of odorants including bile acids and food. Single cell RNA-Seq of the adult zebrafish olfactory organ indicated widespread loss of expression of olfactory receptors as well as inflammatory responses in sustentacular, endothelial, and myeloid cell clusters. Exposure of wildtype zebrafish larvae to SARS-CoV-2 in water did not support active viral replication but caused a sustained inhibition of ace2 expression, triggered type 1 cytokine responses and inhibited type 2 cytokine responses. Combined, our results establish adult and larval zebrafish as useful models to investigate pathophysiological effects of SARS-CoV-2 and perform pre-clinical drug testing and validation in an inexpensive, high throughput vertebrate model.","Kraus, Aurora; Casadei, Elisa; Huertas, Mar; Ye, Chunyan; Bradfute, Steven; Boudinot, Pierre; Levraud, Jean-Pierre; Salinas, Irene",bioRxiv,207,20

It has been observed that both the above compounds interact with the active site of the SARS enzyme through six hydrogen bonds. Also, a clear definition of the binding pocket for KZ7088 has been presented. These findings may provide a solid basis for subsite analysis and mutagenesis relative to rational design of highly selective inhibitors for therapeutic application. Meanwhile, the idea of how to develop inhibitors of the SARS enzyme based on the knowledge of its own peptide substrates (the so-called “distorted key” approach) was also briefly elucidated.","Chou, Kuo-Chen; Wei, Dong-Qing; Zhong, Wei-Zhu",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,207,19

There were three key findings: 1) high copy infectious virus was limited mostly to the alveolar macrophages and endothelial cells of the septal capillaries; 2) viral spike protein without viral RNA localized to ACE2+ endothelial cells in microvessels that were most abundant in the subcutaneous fat and brain; 3) although both infectious virus and docked viral spike protein was associated with complement activation, only the endocytosed pseudovirions induced a marked up-regulation of the key COVID-19 associated proteins IL6, TNF alpha, IL1 beta, p38, IL8, and caspase 3. Importantly, this microvasculitis was associated with characteristic findings on hematoxylin and eosin examination that included endothelial degeneration and resultant basement membrane zone disruption and reduplication. It is concluded that serious COVID-19 infection has two distinct mechanisms: 1) a microangiopathy of pulmonary capillaries associated with a high infectious viral load where endothelial cell death releases pseudovirions into the circulation, and 2) the pseudovirions dock on ACE2+ endothelial cells most prevalent in the skin/subcutaneous fat and brain that activates the complement pathway/coagulation cascade resulting in a systemic procoagulant state as well as the expression of cytokines that produce the cytokine storm. The data predicts a favorable response to therapies based on either removal of circulating viral proteins and/or blunting of the endothelial-induced response.","Magro, Cynthia M.; Mulvey, Justin; Kubiak, Jeffrey; Mikhail, Sheridan; Suster, David; Crowson, A.

We aimed to explore the risk factors associated with death in patients over 70 years old (yr). METHODS: In this retrospective study, we enrolled consecutively hospitalized patients over 70 yr with COVID-19 between January 20 and February 15, 2020 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. Epidemiological, demographic, and clinical data were collected. Clinical subtypes, including mild, moderate, severe, and critical types, were used to evaluate the severity of disease. Patients were classified into two groups: survivor and non-survivor groups. Clinical data were compared between the two groups. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression methods were used to explore the risk factors. RESULTS: A total of 147 patients were enrolled. The case-fatality rate was 28.6%. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression showed that clinical subtypes, including the severe type (HR = 2.983, 95% CI: 1.231–7.226, P = 0.016) and the critical type (HR = 3.267, 95%CI: 1.009–10.576, P = 0.048), were associated with increasing risk of death when compared with the general type. Blood urea nitrogen greater than 9.5 mmol/L (HR = 2.805, 95% CI: 1.141–6.892, P = 0.025) on admission was an independent risk factor for death among laboratory findings. CONCLUSION: The patients over 70 yr with COVID-19 had a high case-fatality rate. The risk factors, including clinical subtypes and blood urea nitrogen greater than 9.5 mmol/L, could help physicians to identify elderly patients with poor clinical outcomes at an early stage.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to identify and characterize pulmonary sequelae caused by SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia at 6-month follow-up. METHODS: In this multicentre, prospective, observational cohort study, patients hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and without prior diagnosis of structural lung diseases were stratified by maximum ventilatory support (“oxygen only,” “continuous positive airway pressure,” and “invasive mechanical ventilation”) and followed up at 6 months from discharge. Pulmonary function tests and diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), 6-min walking test, chest X-ray, physical examination, and modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnoea score were collected. RESULTS: Between March and June 2020, 312 patients were enrolled (83, 27% women; median interquartile range age 61.1 [53.4, 69.3] years). The parameters that showed the highest rate of impairment were DLCO and chest X-ray, in 46% and 25% of patients, respectively. However, only a minority of patients reported dyspnoea (31%), defined as mMRC ≥1, or showed restrictive ventilatory defects (9%). In the logistic regression model, having asthma as a comorbidity was associated with DLCO impairment at follow-up, while prophylactic heparin administration during hospitalization appeared as a protective factor. The need for invasive ventilatory support during hospitalization was associated with chest imaging abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: DLCO and radiological assessment appear to be the most sensitive tools to monitor patients with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during follow-up. Future studies with longer follow-up are warranted to better understand pulmonary sequelae.","Faverio, Paola; Luppi, Fabrizio; Rebora, Paola; Busnelli, Sara; Stainer, Anna; Catalano, Martina; Parachini, Luca; Monzani, Anna; Galimberti, Stefania; Bini, Francesco; Bodini, Bruno Dino; Betti, Monia; De Giacomi, Federica; Scarpazza, Paolo; Oggionni, Elisa; Scartabellati, Alessandro; Bilucaglia, Luca; Ceruti, Paolo; Modina, Denise; Harari, Sergio; Caminati, Antonella; Valsecchi, Maria Grazia; Bellani, Giacomo; Foti, Giuseppe; Pesci, Alberto",Respiration,207,19

We aimed to quantify the medium-term impact of lockdown on referrals to secondary care mental health clinical services. We conducted a controlled interrupted time series study using data from Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust (CPFT), UK (catchment population ~0.86 million). The UK lockdown resulted in an instantaneous drop in mental health referrals but then a longer-term acceleration in the referral rate (by 1.21 referrals per day per day, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.41–2.02). This acceleration was primarily for urgent or emergency referrals (acceleration 0.96, CI 0.39–1.54), including referrals to liaison psychiatry (0.68, CI 0.35–1.02) and mental health crisis teams (0.61, CI 0.20–1.02).

Since Iran is one of the most important countries on the walking path of Arbaeen and has a vital role in providing health services to pilgrims, the experiences of health challenges by participants is of key importance. The aim of this study is to explore stakeholders’ experiences on the health system's preparedness and challenges, and to provide suggestions for preventing infectious diseases during the Arbaeen mass gathering. Methods: A qualitative research method was used with a conventional content analysis approach. The number of participants was 17, including 13 executive managers and 4 health policymakers who entered the study among participants. Semi-structured interviews were used to generate the data. Interviews were analyzed by means of content analysis after face-to-face interviews. Results: Data analysis resulted in the extraction of four main themes and 11 sub-themes. Health infrastructure defects in Iraq has three sub-themes (health abandonment in Iraq, the weaknesses in health culture and problems related to the health system); poor control of the causative factors of infectious diseases has three sub-themes (the underlying factors of the prevalence of contagious diseases, health system response to communicable diseases and ignoring the risks of the Arbaeen ceremony); the low perception of risk in pilgrims has three sub-themes (lack of awareness in pilgrims, fatalism in pilgrims and unhygienic belief in pilgrims); and the ineffectiveness of health education has two sub-themes (training shortage in the targeted group and educational content problems) that shows participant’s experiences of the health system's challenges for coping with infectious diseases during the Arbaeen ceremony.

Nevertheless, in practice, most complex networks might be interconnected with each other (due to the existence of common components) and exhibit layered properties while the connections on different layers represent various relationships. These types of networks are characterized as multiplex networks. A two-layered multiplex network model (usually composed of a virtual layer sustaining unaware-aware-unaware (UAU) dynamics and a physical one supporting susceptible-infected-recovered-dead (SIRD) process) is presented to investigate the spreading property of fatal epidemics in this manuscript. Due to the incorporation of the virtual layer, the recovered and dead individuals seem to play different roles in affecting the epidemic spreading process. In details, the corresponding nodes on the virtual layer for the recovered individuals are capable of transmitting information to other individuals, while the corresponding nodes for the dead individuals (which are to be eliminated) on the virtual layer should be removed as well. With the coupled UAU-SIRD model, the relationships between the focused variables and parameters of the epidemic are studied thoroughly. As indicated by the results, the range of affected individuals will be reduced by a large amount with the incorporation of virtual layers. Furthermore, the effects of recovery time on the epidemic spreading process are also investigated aiming to consider various physical conditions. Theoretical analyses are also derived for scenarios with and without required time periods for recovery which validates the reducing effects of incorporating virtual layers on the epidemic spreading process.","Zhu, Peican; Wang, Xinyu; Li, Shudong; Guo, Yangming; Wang, Zhen",Appl Math Comput,207,16

The rapid deployment of antibody-based countermeasures has provided hope for curtailing disease and ending the pandemic (1) . However, the emergence of rapidly-spreading SARS-CoV-2 variants in the United Kingdom (B.1.1.7), South Africa (B.1.351), and elsewhere with mutations in the spike protein has raised concern for escape from neutralizing antibody responses and loss of vaccine efficacy based on preliminary data with pseudoviruses (2-4) . Here, using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), animal immune sera, human convalescent sera, and human sera from recipients of the Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) mRNA vaccine, we report the impact on antibody neutralization of a panel of authentic SARS-CoV-2 variants including a B.1.1.7 isolate, a chimeric Washington strain with a South African spike gene (Wash SA-B.1.351), and isogenic recombinant variants with designed mutations or deletions at positions 69-70, 417, 484, 501, and/or 614 of the spike protein. Several highly neutralizing mAbs engaging the receptor binding domain (RBD) or N-terminal domain (NTD) lost inhibitory activity against Wash SA-B.1.351 or recombinant variants with an E484K spike mutation. Most convalescent sera and virtually all mRNA vaccine-induced immune sera tested showed markedly diminished neutralizing activity against the Wash SA-B.1.351 strain or recombinant viruses containing mutations at position 484 and 501. We also noted that cell line selection used for growth of virus stocks or neutralization assays can impact the potency of antibodies against different SARS-CoV-2 variants, which has implications for assay standardization and congruence of results across laboratories. As several antibodies binding specific regions of the RBD and NTD show loss-of-neutralization potency in vitro against emerging variants, updated mAb cocktails, targeting of highly conserved regions, enhancement of mAb potency, or adjustments to the spike sequences of vaccines may be needed to prevent loss of protection in vivo .","Diamond, Michael; Chen, Rita; Xie, Xuping; Case, James; Zhang, Xianwen; VanBlargan, Laura; Liu, Yang; Liu, Jianying; Errico, John; Winkler, Emma; Suryadevara, Naveenchandra; Tahan, Stephen; Turner, Jackson; Kim, Wooseob; Schmitz, Aaron; Thapa, Mahima; Wang, David; Boon, Andrianus; Pinto, Dora; Presti, Rachel; Oâ€™Halloran, Jane; Kim, Alfred; Deepak, Parakkal; Fremont, Daved; Corti, Davide; Virgin, Herbert; Crowe, James; Droit, Lindsay; Ellebedy, Ali; Shi, Pei-Yong; Gilchuk, Pavlo",Res Sq,207,10

METHODS: Retrospective review of DS + MMC and trabeculectomy + MMC at a single centre between February 2015 and March 2018. Patients with a minimum of 12-month follow-up were included. Post-operative follow-up: day 1, week 1, months 1/3/6/12/18/24. Primary outcomes: changes in intraocular pressure (IOP) and changes in LogMAR visual acuity (BCVA) pre- and post-procedure. Secondary outcomes: changes in number of eye drops, number of follow-up clinic visits, post-operative complications and further surgical interventions. Complete success: IOP ≤ 21 mmHg off all IOP-lowering medications. Qualified success: IOP ≤ 21 mmHg on medication. Failure: IOP > 21 mmHg at 24 months or ≤ 5 mmHg on 2 consecutive follow-up visits after 3 months +/− additional incisional glaucoma surgery +/− loss of light perception.

The data of the research were analyzed descriptively using the mind mapping method. The data analysis shows that social and economic impacts potentially enhance the threat of forest resource utilization–increasing pressure on the forest due to the increase in forest product demand. Even though the government made efforts to minimize forest degradation and prevent illegal logging, the communities didn't follow the policy because there were no alternative solutions. The timber logging is carried out into a threat to forest degradation when it's not immediately prevented. The FMU needs to improve access to rural living near the forest to increase their forest income.

Methods A systematic literature search using the PubMed, Scopus, and Embase databases were performed from inception of databases up until 3 March 2021. We included studies that fulfill all of the following criteria: 1) observational studies or randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that report COVID-19 patients, 2) reporting colchicine use, and 3) mortality within 30 days. There was no restriction on the age, inpatients or outpatients setting, and severity of diseases. The intervention was colchicine administration during treatment for COVID-19. The control was receiving placebo or standard of care. The outcome was mortality and the pooled effect estimate was reported as odds ratio (OR). Random-effects restricted maximum likelihood meta-regression was performed to evaluate factors affecting the pooled effect estimate. Results Eight studies comprising of 5,530 patients were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. There were three RCTs and five observational studies. Pooled analysis showed that colchicine was associated with lower mortality in patients with COVID-19 (OR 0.47 [0.31, 0.72], p=0.001; I2: 30.9, p=0.181). Meta-regression analysis showed that the association between colchicine and mortality was reduced by increasing age (OR 0.92 [0.85, 1.00], p=0.05), but not gender (reference: male, p=0.999), diabetes (p=0.376), hypertension (p=0.133), and CAD (p=0.354).

However, sensitive populations submitted to longer periods of restrictions may experience detrimental effects in significant areas of their lifestyle, such as sexual activity. This study examines sexual activity during the COVID-19 confinement in Spain. A survey distributed through an institutional social media profile served to collect data, whereas chi-squared tests, t-tests, analyses of variance, and multiple logistic regression analysis were used to assess differences among sample subgroups. A total of 71.3% adults (N = 536) (72.8% female) reported engaging in sexual activity with a weekly average of 2.39 times (SD = 1.80), with significant differences favoring males, middle age, married/in a domestic relationship (p < 0.001), employed (p < 0.005), medium–high annual household income, living outside the Iberian Peninsula, and smoking and alcohol consumption. Analyses adjusted for the complete set of control variables showed significant odds for a lower prevalence of weekly sexual activity in women (OR = 0.44, 95% CI 0.27–0.72). Interventions to promote sexual activity in confined Spanish adults may focus on groups with lower sexual activity.","López-Bueno, Rubén; López-Sánchez, Guillermo F.; Gil-Salmerón, Alejandro; Grabovac, Igor; Tully, Mark A.; Casaña, José; Smith, Lee",Int J Environ Res Public Health,207,1

Data from previous mega-disasters show that losses from disruptions of critical services surpass the value of direct damages in the exposed areas because critical infrastructures [CI] are increasingly (inter-) dependent. Local events may have global impacts. Systemic criticality, which describes the relevance of a critical infrastructure due to its positioning within the system, needs to be addressed to reduce the likelihood of cascading effects. This paper presents novel approaches to operationalise and assess systemic criticality. Firstly, the paper introduces systemic cascade potential as a measurement of systemic criticality. It takes the relevance of a sector and the relevance of its interdependencies into account to generate a relative value of systemic importance for a CI sector. Secondly, an exemplary sectoral assessment of the road network allows reflecting the spatial manifestation of the first level of cascading effects. It analyses the impact of traffic interruptions on the accessibility of critical facilities to point out the systemically most critical segments of the municipal road network. To further operationalise the spatial dimension of criticality, a normative assertion determining the worthiness of protection of system components is required. A nationwide spatial flood protection plan incorporates this aspect in Germany for the first time. Its formal approval process was initiated in February 2020.","Kruse, Philip M.; Schmitt, Hanna C.; Greiving, Stefan",Clim Change,207,22

These viruses are transmitted to humans through contact with their respective South American rodent hosts. Each uses human transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) as its obligate receptor. Accidental similarities between human TfR1 and TfR1 orthologs of arenviral host species enable zoonoses, whereas mice and rats are not infectable because they lack these TfR1 determinants of infection. All pathogenic New World arenaviruses bind to a common region of the apical domain of TfR1. The ability of a New World arenavirus to use human TfR1 is absolutely predictive of its ability to cause hemorrhagic fevers in humans. Non-pathogenic arenaviruses, closely related to hemorrhagic fever arenaviruses, cannot utilize human TfR1 but efficiently enter cells through TfR1 orthologs of their native rodent hosts. Mutagenesis studies suggest that minor changes in the entry glycoproteins of these non-pathogenic viruses may allow human transmission. TfR1 is upregulated as a result of iron sequestration during the acute phase response to infection, and the severity of disease may result from amplification of viral replication during this response.","Choe, Hyeryun; Jemielity, Stephanie; Abraham, Jonathan; Radoshitzky, Sheli R.; Farzan, Michael",Current Opinion in Microbiology,207,16

AIM AND OBJECTIVE: To explore the adverse health problems and skin reactions caused by the use of PPEs among the frontline nurses in the ICUs of COVID hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online-based questionnaire assessing the physical problems, and adverse skin reactions of PPEs were sent among the 150 frontline nurses in ICUs of COVID hospital. The collected data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: We got 137 valid responses from frontline nurses, and the most common adverse health effects expressed by them were headache (73.4%), extreme sweating (59.6%), and difficulty in breathing (36.7%); 91.7% complained about the fogging of the goggle. Majority of frontline nurses expressed nasal bridge scarring (76.64%) and indentation and pain on the back of the ears (66.42%) as the adverse skin reactions after wearing N95 masks. The common skin problems identified due to double gloving of latex gloves were excessive skin soakage with sweat (70.07%) and skin chapping (19%). The protective clothing caused minimal adverse reactions, and excessive sweating (71.53%) was the most reported.

Taking into account the mechanisms of hydrophobic interaction, hydration shell, surface tension, and the shielding effect of water molecules, this study reveals a hydrophobic‐interaction‐based mechanism by means of which SARS‐CoV‐2 S and ACE2 bind together in an aqueous environment. The hydrophobic interaction between the SARS‐CoV‐2 S and ACE2 protein is found to be significantly greater than that between SARS‐CoV S and ACE2. At the docking site, the hydrophobic portions of the hydrophilic side chains of SARS‐CoV‐2 S are found to be involved in the hydrophobic interaction between SARS‐CoV‐2 S and ACE2.","Li, Jiacheng; Ma, Xiaoliang; Guo, Shuai; Hou, Chengyu; Shi, Liping; Zhang, Hongchi; Zheng, Bing; Liao, Chenchen; Yang, Lin; Ye, Lin; He, Xiaodong",Glob Chall,207,8

Here, we assessed the SNPs associated with COVID-19 risk from the GWAS data of Spanish and Italian patients and lung eQTL data from the GTEx project. Then, GWAS and eQTL data were integrated by summary-data-based (SMR) methods using SNPs as instrumental variables (IVs). As a result, six protein-coding and five non-protein-coding genes regulated by nine SNPs were identified as significant risk factors for COVID-19. Functional analysis of these genes showed that UQCRH participates in cardiac muscle contraction, PPA2 is closely related to sudden cardiac failure (SCD), and OGT, as the interacting gene partner of PANO1, is associated with neurological disease.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of prebiotic supplementation with stabilized rice bran (SRB) in milk on health, immunity, and performance of pre-weaned organic dairy calves. Holstein heifer calves (n = 90) were enrolled at 6 ± 1 days old and monitored for 28 days, from July to August 2017. Calves were randomly assigned to a control (CTR; n = 45) or a treatment group (SRB; n = 45). The CTR group received milk alone and the SRB group received 120 g of SRB per day in milk to achieve a 10% w/w dose of the total calories. Daily health evaluations were conducted to score health status and disease severity (healthy, slightly affected, moderately or severely sick) of calves, through integrated assessment of diarrhea, dehydration, attitude, and milk intake. Body weights and fecal IgA quantification were completed on the first and last day of the study. RESULTS: Overall, weight gain and fecal IgA concentrations were not affected by the dietary addition of SRB. The total number of calf-days classified as healthy or sick were not different between treatment groups. Similarly, the number of calf-days categorized as slightly affected, moderately sick, or severely sick did not differ between treatment groups. Time to event analyses indicated a tendency for a treatment effect in the time to the first moderate case of diarrhea (P = 0.08), as well as in the time to recovery from diarrhea (P = 0.052), favoring control calves.

The Sepsis Transition and Recovery (STAR) program is a navigator-led, telehealth-based multicomponent strategy to provide proactive care coordination and monitoring of high-risk patients using evidence-driven, post-sepsis care tasks. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of STAR to improve outcomes for sepsis patients and to examine contextual factors that influence STAR implementation. METHODS: This study uses a hybrid type I effectiveness-implementation design to concurrently test clinical effectiveness and gather implementation data. The effectiveness evaluation is a two-arm, pragmatic, stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial at eight hospitals in North Carolina comparing clinical outcomes between sepsis survivors who receive Usual Care versus care delivered through STAR. Each hospital begins in a Usual Care control phase and transitions to STAR in a randomly assigned sequence (one every 4 months). During months that a hospital is allocated to Usual Care, all eligible patients will receive usual care. Once a hospital transitions to STAR, all eligible patients will receive STAR during their hospitalization and extending through 90 days from discharge. STAR includes centrally located nurse navigators using telephonic counseling and electronic health record-based support to facilitate best-practice post-sepsis care strategies including post-discharge review of medications, evaluation for new impairments or symptoms, monitoring existing comorbidities, and palliative care referral when appropriate. Adults admitted with suspected sepsis, defined by clinical criteria for infection and organ failure, are included. Planned enrollment is 4032 patients during a 36-month period. The primary effectiveness outcome is the composite of all-cause hospital readmission or mortality within 90 days of discharge. A mixed-methods implementation evaluation will be conducted before, during, and after STAR implementation. DISCUSSION: This pragmatic evaluation will test the effectiveness of STAR to reduce combined hospital readmissions and mortality, while identifying key implementation factors. Results will provide practical information to advance understanding of how to integrate post-sepsis management across care settings and facilitate implementation, dissemination, and sustained utilization of best-practice post-sepsis management strategies in other heterogeneous healthcare delivery systems.

Today humanity is facing another infectious threat: a newly emerging virus SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19. It was already described that COVID-19 mortality among elderly people and people with such underlying conditions as obesity, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes s increased. Dysregulation of the immune responses vital for antiviral defense, which are typical for chronic inflammation, led us to a hypothesis that chronic inflammation is the main risk factor for increased susceptibility and mortality from COVID-19. Method. Based on the available information for 126 countries, statistical analysis to find out whether the difference in incidence and mortality within countries can be explained by the existing chronic inflammation among the countries population, was conducted. Results. A positive correlation between the percentage of people dying from chronic noncommunicable diseases and COVID-19 incidence (p<0.001) and mortality (p<0.001) within countries. Conclusion. The problem of COVID-19-caused high mortality rate may be a consequence of the high number of people having chronic low-grade inflammation as a precondition, and thus, one of the potential ways to reduce risk of morbidity and mortality is to focus on this widespread health problem, mainly occurring in developed countries and to take corresponding diagnostic, preventative, and treatment measures.","Tskhay, Albina; Yezhova, Alena; Alibek, Kenneth",,207,4

In this device, the reorientation of the CLCs was consistently influenced by the surface of the four channel walls and adjacent CLCs. When the inside of the microchannel was coated with the alignment layer, the CLCs oriented homeotropically in a focal conic state under cross-polarizers. Once antigens had bound onto antibodies immobilized onto the orientation sheet-coated channel walls, the light intensity of the CLC molecules converted from a focal conic state to a bright planar state caused by disrupting the CLCs. By means of utilizing pressure-propelling flow, the attachment of antigen/antibody to the CLCs should be detectable within consecutive sequences. The multi-microfluidic CLC-based chips were verified by measuring bovine serum albumin (BSA) and immune complexes of pairs of BSA antigen/antibody. We showed that the multiple microfluidic immunoassaying can be used for measuring BSA and pairs of antigen/antibody BSA with a detection limit of about 1 ng/mL. The linear range is 0.1 μg/mL–1 mg/mL. A limit of immune detection of pairs of BSA antigens/antibodies was 10 ng/mL of BSA plus 1000 ng/mL of the anti-BSA antibodies was observed.

The potential shortage might call for the reuse of personal protective equipment especially N95 masks. In this review, the methods available for decontamination of N95 masks have been compared to highlight the advantages and efficacies of different methods. Studies conducted to evaluate the biocidal efficacy, effect on filtration efficacy of the decontamination method, and maintenance of structural integrity of masks, were reviewed. Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) vapour were the most commonly evaluated interventions and showed good germicidal activity without significant deleterious effects on mask performance. Vapourous H2O2 was the best method as it maintained NIOSH (The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health) recommendations of the mask on re-use and additionally, one mask could be decontaminated and reused 30 times. Ethylene oxide (EtO) preserved the maximum filtration efficacy and flow resistance. Chemical and heat-based methods had the advantages of being cost-effective and feasible but affected the structural integrity and fit of the masks. For the decontamination of N95 masks, among the heat-based methods steam was found to be the best for low middle-income countries setting. H2O2-based methods, UVGI, and EtO all exhibited both adequate biocidal efficacies and functionality (fit testing and structural integrity). Further studies on logistics, healthcare worker acceptability of reuse, and actual efficacy of protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection should be carried out to validate the use of decontamination in the real-life settings.","Kanaujia, Rimjhim; Angrup, Archana; Biswal, Manisha; Sehgal, Inderpaul Singh; Ray, Pallab",Indian j. med. res,207,24

Respiratory droplets are known to be the most prominent source of transmission for COVID-19; however, alternative routes may exist given the discovery of small numbers of viable viruses in urine and stool samples. Flushing biomatter can lead to the aerosolization of micro-organisms; thus, there is a likelihood that bioaerosols generated in public restrooms may pose a concern for the transmission of COVID-19, especially since these areas are relatively confined, experience heavy foot traffic, and may suffer from inadequate ventilation. To quantify the extent of aerosolization, we measure the size and number of droplets generated by flushing toilets and urinals in a public restroom. The results indicate that the particular designs tested in the study generate a large number of droplets in the size range [Formula: see text] – [Formula: see text] , which can reach heights of at least 1.52 m. Covering the toilet reduced aerosol levels but did not eliminate them completely, suggesting that aerosolized droplets escaped through small gaps between the cover and the seat. In addition to consistent increases in aerosol levels immediately after flushing, there was a notable rise in ambient aerosol levels due to the accumulation of droplets from multiple flushes conducted during the tests. This highlights the need for incorporating adequate ventilation in the design and operation of public spaces, which can help prevent aerosol accumulation in high occupancy areas and mitigate the risk of airborne disease transmission.","Schreck, Jesse H.; Lashaki, Masoud Jahandar; Hashemi, Javad; Dhanak, Manhar; Verma, Siddhartha",Phys Fluids (1994),207,17

However, traditional injected vaccines are generally poor inducers of mucosal immunity. One of the effective strategies to improve vaccine efficacy is incorporation of adjuvant molecules that enhance and polarize adaptive immune reactions. Effects of Syk-coupled lectin receptor agonists as adjuvants to induce mucosal immune reactions during parenteral immunization are not fully studied. We now report that the agonists trehalose-6,6-dibehenate (TDB), curdlan, and furfurman, which stimulate Dectin-1, Dectin-2, and Mincle, respectively, activate transcription factors (NF-κB, NFAT, and AP-1) to various extents in murine RAW 264.7 macrophages, even though similar pathways are activated. The agonists also elicit differential expression of maturation markers in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells, as well as differential cytokine secretion from these cells and from splenic mononuclear cells. In vivo assays also show that agonists of Dectin-1 and Dectin-2, but not Mincle, induce heavy IgA secretion in intestinal mucosa even when delivered parenterally. Strikingly, this effect appears to be formulation-independent. Collectively, the data suggest that adjuvants based on Dectin-1 and Dectin-2 agonists may significantly improve the efficacy of parenteral vaccines by inducing robust local immune reactions in intestinal mucosa.","Dzharullaeva, Alina S.; Tukhvatulin, Amir I.; Erokhova, Alina S.; Bandelyuk, Alina S.; Polyakov, Nikita B.; Solovyev, Andrey I.; Nikitenko, Natalia A.; Shcheblyakov, Dmitry V.; Naroditsky, Boris S.; Logunov, Denis Y.; Gintsburg, Alexander L.",J Immunol Res,207,30

However, recent advancements in the fields of genetics, molecular biology, biochemistry, and immunology have renewed interest in these immunotherapies and allowed the development of promising cancer vaccine candidates. Numerous clinical trials testing the response evoked by tumour antigens, differing in origin and nature, have shed light on the desirable target characteristics capable of inducing strong tumour-specific non-toxic responses with increased potential to bring clinical benefit to patients. Novel delivery methods, ranging from a patient’s autologous dendritic cells to liposome nanoparticles, have exponentially increased the abundance and exposure of the antigenic payloads. Furthermore, growing knowledge of the mechanisms by which tumours evade the immune response has led to new approaches to reverse these roadblocks and to re-invigorate previously suppressed anti-tumour surveillance. The use of new drugs in combination with antigen-based therapies is highly targeted and may represent the future of cancer vaccines. In this review, we address the main antigens and delivery methods used to develop cancer vaccines, their clinical outcomes, and the new directions that the vaccine immunotherapy field is taking.","Tay, Ban Qi; Wright, Quentin; Ladwa, Rahul; Perry, Christopher; Leggatt, Graham; Simpson, Fiona; Wells, James W.; Panizza, Benedict J.; Frazer, Ian H.; Cruz, Jazmina L.

It addressed three main research questions: Did people who were in difficult economic situations before the epidemic face more barriers to accessing healthcare than others? If so, to what extent can these discrepancies be attributed to initial differences in health status, use of care, income or education between vulnerable individuals and non-vulnerable individuals or to differential effects of the pandemic on these groups? Did the effect of economic vulnerability with regard to unmet needs during the pandemic differ across countries? Unmet healthcare needs are characterised by three types of behaviours likely to be induced by the pandemic: forgoing care for fear of contracting COVID-19, having pre-scheduled care postponed and being unable to obtain medical appointments or treatments when needed. Our results substantiate the existence of significant differences in accessing healthcare during the pandemic according to economic vulnerability and of cumulative effects of economic and medical vulnerabilities: the impact of economic vulnerability is notably stronger among those who were in poor health before the outbreak and thus the oldest individuals. The cross-country comparison highlighted heterogeneous effects of economic vulnerability on forgoing care and having care postponed among countries, which are not comparable to the initial cross-country differences in social inequalities in access to healthcare.

This is due to the availability of new molecular and experimental tools. Circumstantial evidence points towards a potentially causative role as well as to possibly protective effects of certain respiratory viruses in the cause of allergic asthma during early childhood. In addition, it now has become clear that exacerbations of asthma, in children as well as adults, are mostly associated with respiratory virus infections, with a predominant role of the common cold virus: rhinovirus. Careful human in vitro and in vivo experiments have shown that rhinovirus can potentially stimulate bronchial epithelial cells to produce pro‐inflammatory chemokines and cytokines, may activate cholinergic‐ or noncholinergic nerves, increase epithelial‐derived nitric oxide synthesis, upregulate local ICAM‐1 expression, and can lead to nonspecific T‐cell responses and/or virus‐specific T‐cell proliferation. Experimental rhinovirus infections in patients with asthma demonstrate features of exacerbation, such as lower airway symptoms, variable airways obstruction, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness, the latter being associated with eosinophil counts and eosinophilic cationic protein levels in induced sputum. This suggests that multiple cellular pathways can be involved in rhinovirus‐induced asthma exacerbations. It is still unknown whether these mechanisms are a distinguishing characteristic of asthma. Because of the limited effects of inhaled steroids during asthma exacerbations, new therapeutic interventions need to be developed based on the increasing pathophysiological knowledge about the role of viruses in asthma.","GRÜnberg, K.; Sterk, P.

We aimed to demonstrate the effect of vitamin D levels on survival in COVID-19 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 207 COVID-19 patients were included in the study. Serum vitamin D levels were measured, and patients with levels <20 ng/ml or 21 to 30 ng received a single 300.000 IU dose of vitamin D. RESULTS: Of 207 patients, 37 received vitamin D, while 170 did not. Demographic, radiologic and mean laboratory values were similar between the groups. The mean plasma vitamin D level without vitamin D support (n=170) was 50.82±16.12 ng/ml (30.28-81.35) vs. 16.98±6.2 ng/ml (4.20-28.30) in vitamin D group. The most remarkable finding were the mortality rates; while only 1 patient (2.7 %) died in the vitamin D group, 24 patients (14.1 %) died in no vitamin D supplementation group (p=0.038). CONCLUSION: Although a few retrospective studies put forth a relation between vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 course severity there is still paucity of data about the efficacy of vitamin supplementations in COVID-19 patients. A single 300.000 IU dose of vitamin D seems to represent a useful, practical, and safe adjunctive approach for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19 (Tab. 1, Fig. 1, Ref. 30).","Yildiz, M; Senel, M U; Kavurgaci, S; Ozturk, F E; Ozturk, A",Bratisl Lek Listy,207,20

During the process of apoptosis induced by TGEV infection in PK-15 cells, the miR-27b is notably down-regulated. Thus, we speculate that miR-27b is involved in regulating the process of apoptosis in PK-15 cells. In this study we demonstrated that the over-expression of miR-27b led to the inhibition of TGEV-induced apoptosis, reduction of Bax protein level, and decrease of caspase-3 and −9 activities. Conversely, silencing of miR-27b by miR-27b inhibitors enhanced apoptosis via up-regulating Bax expression and promoting the activities of caspase-3 and −9 in TGEV-infected cells. Subsequently, the runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) is a candidate target of miR-27b predicted by bioinformatics search. We further identified that the miR-27b directly bound to the 3′ UTR of RUNX1 mRNA and suppressed RUNX1 expression, which indicates RUNX1 is the direct target gene of miR-27b. The over-expression of RUNX1 increased apoptosis and knockdown RUNX1blocked apoptosis of viral-infected cells via regulating Bax expression and the activities of caspase-3 and −9. Our data reveal that miR-27b may repress the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis by targeting RUNX1, indicating that TGEV may induce apoptosis via down-regulating miR-27b and that miR-27b may act as a target for therapeutic intervention.","Zhao, Xiaomin; Song, Xiangjun; Bai, Xiaoyuan; Fei, Naijiao; Huang, Yong; Zhao, Zhimin; Du, Qian; Zhang, Hongling; Zhang, Liang; Tong, Dewen",PeerJ,207,16

METHODS: We developed and evaluated a reverse transcription isothermal nucleic acid amplification method, reverse transcription strand invasion based amplification (RT-SIBA), for the rapid detection of RSV. RESULTS: The developed RT-SIBA assay showed good sensitivity by detecting as few as 10 copies of RSV RNA within 20 min compared with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, which took approximately 2 h.

The aim of this paper is to understand how toxin services have dealt with the situation and what strategies have been adopted to continue services. The recommendations are based on a virtual round table held with toxin services experts from different European countries who shared their experiences and discussed the best practices. The challenges for toxin services were reviewed based on the experts’ experiences and on relevant literature from 2020 and 2021. A set of recommendations and best practices were compiled, focusing firstly on guidance for clinical practice, including assessing patients’ health and risk status and the urgency of their treatment. Secondly, it was discussed how patients on botulinum toxin therapy can be cared for and supported during the pandemic, and how modern technology and tele-medicine platforms can be generally used to optimize effectiveness and safety of toxin treatments. The technological advances prompted by the COVID-19 crisis can result in better and more modern patient care in the future.","Bavikatte, Ganesh; Jacinto, Jorge; Deltombe, Thierry; Wissel, Joerg",Toxins (Basel),207,1

A population of 23 SDD patients undergoing unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA), total knee arthroplasty (TKA), or total hip arthroplasty (THA) were given a cellular BP/HR monitor, with real-time data capture. Patients took three readings after surgery, observing for specific blood pressure decreases, HR increases, or hypotensive symptoms. If any criteria applied, patients followed a hydration protocol and delayed ambulation. Home coaching was also provided to each patient. Patient experience was surveyed, and responses were assessed using descriptive statistics. Of 18 patients discharged (78%), 17 returned surveys, of which 100% reported successful device operation. The mean “ease of use” rating was 8.9/10; satisfaction with home coaching was 9.7/10; and belief that the protocol improved patient safety was 8.4/10. A total of 27.8% (n = 5) had hypotensive readings and appropriately delayed ambulation. Our pilot findings support the feasibility of and confirm the satisfaction with remote monitoring after SDD arthroplasty.

In this study the ‘air cleaning’ effect as well as the effect on sound and air velocity (draught risk) of a mobile High-Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filter system was tested for different settings and positions in the Experience room of the SenseLab. From both the noise assessments by a panel of subjects and sound monitoring it was concluded that the mobile HEPA filter system causes an unacceptable background sound level in the tested classroom setting (Experience room). With respect to the air velocity measurements and draught rating calculations, it was concluded that both depend on the position and the setting of the HEPA filter system as well as on the position and height of the measurements. For the removal of aerosols simulated by air-filled soap bubbles in front of the subject, the mobile HEPA filter system performed better as compared to the ‘No ventilation’ regime, for all settings and both positions, and for some settings, even better than all the tested mixing ventilation regimes. The use of a mobile HEPA filter system seems a good additional measure when only natural ventilation options are available. Future research should focus on rooms of different sizes or shapes, as this may also play a role in the filter's performance, noise and draught effects.","Bluyssen, Philomena M.; Ortiz, Marco; Zhang, Dadi",Build Environ,207,20

As opposed to all other SARS-Coronavirus strains, Frankfurt-1 has a 45-nucleotide deletion in the transmembrane domain of its ORF 7b protein. When over-expressed in HEK 293 cells, the full-length protein but not the variant with the deletion caused interferon beta induction and cleavage of procaspase 3. To study the role of ORF 7b in the context of virus replication, we cloned a full genome cDNA copy of Frankfurt-1 in a bacterial artificial chromosome downstream of a T7 RNA polymerase promoter. Transfection of capped RNA transcribed from this construct yielded infectious virus that was indistinguishable from the original virus isolate. The presumed Frankfurt-1 ancestor with an intact ORF 7b was reconstructed. In CaCo-2 and HUH7 cells, but not in Vero cells, the variant carrying the ORF 7b deletion had a replicative advantage against the parental virus (4- and 6-fold increase of virus RNA in supernatant, respectively). This effect was neither associated with changes in the induction or secretion of type I interferon, nor with altered induction of apoptosis in cell culture. However, pretreatment of cells with interferon beta caused the deleted virus to replicate to higher titers than the parental strain (3.4-fold in Vero cells, 7.9-fold in CaCo-2 cells). In Syrian Golden Hamsters inoculated intranasally with 10e4 plaque forming units of either virus, mean titers of infectious virus and viral RNA in the lungs after 24 h were increased 23- and 94.8-fold, respectively, with the deleted virus. This difference could explain earlier observations of enhanced virulence of Frankfurt-1 in Hamsters as compared to other SARS-Coronavirus reference strains and identifies the SARS-CoV 7b protein as an attenuating factor with the SARS-Coronavirus genome. Because attenuation was focused on the early phase of infection in-vivo, ORF 7b might have contributed to the delayed accumulation of virus in patients that was suggested to have limited the spread of the SARS epidemic.","Pfefferle, Susanne; Krähling, Verena; Ditt, Vanessa; Grywna, Klaus; Mühlberger, Elke; Drosten, Christian",Virol J,207,3

Although most of the microorganisms that coexist with us are located in the gut, microbial cells present in other locations (like skin, respiratory tract, genitourinary tract, and the vaginal zone in women) also play a significant role regulating host health. The fact that there are different kinds of microbiota in different body areas does not mean they are independent. It is plausible that connection exist, and different studies have shown that the microbiota present in different zones of the human body has the capability of communicating through secondary metabolites. In this sense, dysbiosis in one body compartment may negatively affect distal areas and contribute to the development of diseases. Accordingly, it could be hypothesized that the whole set of microbial cells that inhabit the human body form a system, and the dialogue between the different host microbiotas may be a contributing factor for the susceptibility to developing diseased states. For this reason, the present review aims to integrate the available literature on the relationship between the different human microbiotas and understand how changes in the microbiota in one body region can influence other microbiota communities in a bidirectional process. The findings suggest that the different microbiotas may act in a coordinated way to decisively influence human well-being. This new integrative paradigm opens new insights in the microbiota field of research and its relationship with human health that should be taken into account in future studies.","Martínez, Jose E.; Vargas, Augusto; Pérez-Sánchez, Tania; Encío, Ignacio J.; Cabello-Olmo, Miriam; Barajas, Miguel",Nutrients,207,13

We subjected CHIKV-infected Human Embryo Kidney cells (HEK293), a widely used cell-based system for CHIKV infection studies, to a high throughput expression proteomics analysis by Liquid Chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. A total of 1047 differentially expressed proteins were identified in infected cells, consistently in three biological replicates. Proteins involved in transcription, translation, apoptosis and stress response were the major ones among the 209 proteins that had significant up-regulation. In the set of 45 down-regulated proteins, those involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism predominated. A STRING network analysis revealed tight interaction of proteins within the apoptosis, stress response and protein synthesis pathways. We short-listed a common set of 30 proteins that can be implicated in cellular pathology of CHIKV infection by comparing our results and results of earlier CHIKV proteomics studies. Modulation of eight proteins selected from this set was re-confirmed at transcript level. One among them, Nucleophosmin, a nuclear chaperone, showed temporal modulation and cytoplasmic aggregation upon CHIKV infection in double immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy. The short-listed cellular proteins will be potential candidates for targeted study of the molecular interactions of CHIKV with host cells. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Chikungunya remained as a neglected tropical disease till its re-emergence in 2005 in the La RéUnion islands and subsequently, in India and many parts of South East Asia. These and the epidemics that followed in subsequent years ran an explosive course leading to extreme morbidity and attributed mortality to this originally benign virus infection. Apart from classical symptoms of acute fever and debilitating polyarthralgia lasting for several weeks, a number of complications were documented. These included aphthous-like ulcers and vesiculo-bullous eruptions on the skin, hepatic involvement, central nervous system complications such as encephalopathy and encephalitis, and transplacental transmission. The disease has recently spread to the Americas with its initial documentation in the Caribbean islands. The Asian genotype of this positive-stranded RNA virus of the Alphavirus genus has been attributed in these outbreaks. However, the disease ran a similar course as the one caused by the East, Central and South African (ECSA) genotype in the other parts of the world. Studies have documented a number of mutations in the re-emerging strains of the virus that enhances mosquito adaptability and modulates virus infectivity. This might support the occurrence of fiery outbreaks in the absence of herd immunity in affected population. Several research groups work to understand the pathogenesis of chikungunya and the mechanisms of complications using cellular and animal models. A few proteomics approaches have been employed earlier to understand the protein level changes in the infected cells. Our present study, which couples a high throughput proteomic analysis and a comparative review of these earlier studies, identifies a few critical molecules as hypothetical candidates that might be important in this infection and for future study.","Abraham, Rachy; Mudaliar, Prashant; Jaleel, Abdul; Srikanth, Jandhyam; Sreekumar, Easwaran",J Proteomics,207,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Through a citizen science initiative, we leveraged publicly available and crowd-verified data on COVID-19 outbreak in Kerala from the government bulletins and media outlets to generate reusable datasets. This was further visualized as a dashboard through a frontend web application and a JSON repository, which serves as an API for the frontend. RESULTS: From the sourced data, we provided real-time analysis, and daily updates of COVID-19 cases in Kerala, through a user-friendly bilingual dashboard (https://covid19kerala.info/) for non-specialists. To ensure longevity and reusability, the dataset was deposited in an open-access public repository for future analysis. Finally, we provide outbreak trends and demographic characteristics of the individuals affected with COVID-19 in Kerala during the first 138 days of the outbreak.

We assessed the feasibility and clinical relevance of frailty status in Korean older inpatients using the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) and Korean version of the Fatigue, Resistance, Ambulation, Illnesses, & Loss of Weight scale (K-FRAIL) questionnaires. METHODS: Frailty status was measured using the Korean-translated version of the CFS and K-FRAIL questionnaire within 3 days from admission in 144 consecutive patients aged 60 years or older. The correlation between CFS and K-FRAIL score was assessed. The criterion validity of CFS was assessed using receiver operating characteristic analysis. As outcomes, delirium, bedsore, length of stay (LOS), in-hospital mortality, and unplanned 30-day readmission were measured by reviewing medical records. RESULTS: The mean age of the study population was 70.1 years (range, 60 to 91), and 75 (52.1%) were men. By linear regression analysis, CFS and K-FRAIL were positively correlated (B = 0.72, p < 0.001). A CFS cutoff of ≥ 5 maximized sensitivity + specificity to classify frailty using K-FRAIL as a reference (C-index = 0.893). Higher frailty burden by both CFS and K-FRAIL was associated with higher LOS and bedsores. Unplanned readmission and in-hospital mortality were associated with higher CFS score but not with K-FRAIL score, after adjusting for age, gender, polypharmacy, and multimorbidity. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty status by CFS was associated with LOS, bedsores, unplanned readmission, and in-hospital mortality.

Here we conduct ex vivo assays to evaluate SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell responses in COVID-19 convalescent patients up to 317 days post-symptom onset (DPSO), and find that memory T cell responses are maintained during the study period regardless of the severity of COVID-19. In particular, we observe sustained polyfunctionality and proliferation capacity of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells. Among SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells detected by activation-induced markers, the proportion of stem cell-like memory T (T(SCM)) cells is increased, peaking at approximately 120 DPSO. Development of T(SCM) cells is confirmed by SARS-CoV-2-specific MHC-I multimer staining. Considering the self-renewal capacity and multipotency of T(SCM) cells, our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells are long-lasting after recovery from COVID-19, thus support the feasibility of effective vaccination programs as a measure for COVID-19 control.","Jung, Jae Hyung; Rha, Min-Seok; Sa, Moa; Choi, Hee Kyoung; Jeon, Ji Hoon; Seok, Hyeri; Park, Dae Won; Park, Su-Hyung; Jeong, Hye Won; Choi, Won Suk; Shin, Eui-Cheol",Nat Commun,207,16

Most years, BOSC has been part of the Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) conference, but in 2018, and again in 2020, BOSC partnered with the Galaxy Community Conference (GCC). This year’s combined BOSC + GCC conference was called the Bioinformatics Community Conference (BCC2020, bcc2020.github.io). Originally slated to take place in Toronto, Canada, BCC2020 was moved online due to COVID-19. The meeting started with a wide array of training sessions; continued with a main program of keynote presentations, talks, posters, Birds of a Feather, and more; and ended with four days of collaboration (CoFest). Efforts to make the meeting accessible and inclusive included very low registration fees, talks presented twice a day, and closed captioning for all videos. More than 800 people from 61 countries registered for at least one part of the meeting, which was held mostly in the Remo.co video-conferencing platform.","Harris, Nomi L.; Cock, Peter J.A.; Fields, Christopher J.; Hokamp, Karsten; Maia, Jessica; Munoz-Torres, Monica; Taschuk, Morgan; Yehudi, Yo",F1000Res,207,33
