899,Human Bocaviruses Are Not Significantly Associated with Gastroenteritis: Results of Retesting Archive DNA from a Case Control Study in the UK,2012-07-24,"Gastroenteritis is a common illness causing considerable morbidity and mortality worldwide. Despite improvements in detection methods, a significant diagnostic gap still remains. Human bocavirus (HBoV)s, which are associated with respiratory infections, have also frequently been detected in stool samples in cases of gastroenteritis, and a tentative association between HBoVs, and in particular type-2 HBoVs, and gastroenteritis has previously been made. The aim of this study was to determine the role of HBoVs in gastroenteritis, using archived DNA samples from the case-control Infectious Intestinal Disease Study (IID). DNA extracted from stool samples from 2,256 cases and 2,124 controls were tested for the presence of HBoV DNA. All samples were screened in a real time PCR pan-HBoV assay, and positive samples were then tested in genotype 1 to 3-specific assays. HBoV was detected in 7.4% but no significantly different prevalence was observed between cases and controls. In the genotype-specific assays 106 of the 324 HBoV-positive samples were genotyped, with HBoV-1 predominantly found in controls whilst HBoV-2 was more frequently associated with cases of gastroenteritis (p<0.01). A significant proportion of HBoV positives could not be typed using the type specific assays, 67% of the total positives, and this was most likely due to low viral loads being present in the samples. However, the distribution of the untyped HBoV strains was no different between cases and controls. In conclusion, HBoVs, including HBoV-2 do not appear to be a significant cause of gastroenteritis in the UK population.","Nawaz, Sameena; Allen, David J.; Aladin, Farah; Gallimore, Christopher; Iturriza-Gómara, Miren",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3404102/,244
1363,Comparison of Road Traffic Injury Characteristics between Local versus Floating Migrant Patients in a Tertiary Hospital between 2007 and 2010,2014-01-27,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to give a description of the road traffic injuries (RTIs) characteristics of floating migrant population by comparing with those of local residents in a harbor city of China. METHODS: A population-based descriptive study was carried out between 2007 and 2010 with RTI patient records from the Fifth Center Hospital of Tianjin. Inpatient diagnoses of RTI patients were defined using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes. We analyzed the demographics and general characteristics of RTI patients that were in the hospital during the four years. In order to compare the group differences between local resident patients and floating migrant patients, the distribution of their ages, diagnoses, severity of injuries, duration of inpatient stays, hospitalization cost were analyzed. RESULTS: People between the ages of 16 and 55 were the most likely to suffer RTIs. The floating migrant patients between the ages of 16 and 45 had a higher incidence of accidents, while local resident patients between 46 and 55 had a higher incidence of accidents. Compared to local resident patients, floating migrant patients were more vulnerable to open injuries and severe traffic injuries. With the severity of injuries ranked from mild to severe, floating migrant patients had lower duration of inpatient stay, but higher hospitalization costs compared to local resident patients. CONCLUSIONS: Floating migrant patients had a different age distribution, severity of injuries, diseases, inpatient duration and hospitalization cost compared with local resident patients. Compared to local resident patients, floating migrants had a higher risk to RTIs and were more vulnerable to severer traffic accidents at lower ages.","Xu, Chungui; Wang, Yanhua; Han, Na; Kou, Yuhui; Yin, Xiaofeng; Zhang, Peixun; Wang, Tianbing; Zhang, Dianying; Jiang, Baoguo",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3903469/,244
2370,Diminazene Aceturate Improves Cardiac Fibrosis and Diastolic Dysfunction in Rats with Kidney Disease,2016-08-29,"Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 is a negative regulator of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) through its role to degrade angiotensin II. In rats with subtotal nephrectomy (STNx), adverse cardiac remodelling occurs despite elevated cardiac ACE2 activity. We hypothesised that diminazene aceturate (DIZE), which has been described as having an off-target effect to activate ACE2, would have beneficial cardiac effects in STNx rats. STNx led to hypertension, diastolic dysfunction, left ventricular hypertrophy, cardiac fibrosis, and increased cardiac ACE, ACE2, Ang II and Ang 1–7 levels. Cardiac gene expression of ADAM17 was also increased. In STNx, two-weeks of subcutaneous DIZE (15mg/kg/d) had no effect on blood pressure but improved diastolic dysfunction and cardiac fibrosis, reduced ADAM17 mRNA and shifted the cardiac RAS balance to a cardioprotective profile with reduced ACE and Ang II. There was no change in cardiac ACE2 activity or in cardiac Ang 1–7 levels with DIZE. In conclusion, our results suggest that DIZE exerts a protective effect on the heart under the pathological condition of kidney injury. This effect was not due to improved kidney function, a fall in blood pressure or a reduction in LVH but was associated with a reduction in cardiac ACE and cardiac Ang II levels. As in vitro studies showed no direct effect of DIZE on ACE2 or ACE activity, the precise mechanism of action of DIZE remains to be determined.","Velkoska, Elena; Patel, Sheila K.; Griggs, Karen; Burrell, Louise M.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5003360/,244
2815,The Utility of Preliminary Patient Evaluation in a Febrile Respiratory Infectious Disease Unit outside the Emergency Department,2017-07-03,"A febrile respiratory infectious disease unit (FRIDU) with a negative pressure ventilation system was constructed outside the emergency department (ED) of the Samsung Medical Center in 2015, to screen for patients with contagious diseases requiring isolation. We evaluated the utility of the FRIDU during 1 year of operation. We analyzed 1,562 patients who were hospitalized after FRIDU screening between August 2015 and July 2016. The level of isolation recommended during their screening at the FRIDU was compared with the level deemed appropriate given their final diagnosis. Of the 1,562 patients screened at the FRIDU, 198 (13%) were isolated, 194 (12%) were reverse isolated, and 1,170 (75%) were not isolated. While hospitalized, 97 patients (6%) were confirmed to have a contagious disease requiring isolation, such as tuberculosis; 207 patients (13%) were confirmed to be immunocompromised and to require reverse isolation, mainly due to neutropenia; and the remaining 1,258 patients (81%) did not require isolation. The correlation coefficient for isolation consistency was 0.565 (P < 0.001). The sensitivity and negative predictive value of FRIDU screening for diagnosing contagious disease requiring isolation are 76% and 98%, respectively. No serious nosocomial outbreaks of contagious diseases occurred. During FRIDU screening, 114 patients were admitted to the resuscitation zone due to clinical instability, and three of these patients died. The initial isolation levels resulting from FRIDU screening were moderately well correlated with the isolation levels required by the final diagnosis, demonstrating the utility of pre-hospitalization screening units. However, the risks of deterioration during the screening process remain challenges.","Kang, Jun Sik; Jhun, Byung Woo; Yoon, Hee; Lim, Seong Mi; Ko, Eunsil; Park, Joo Hyun; Hwang, Sung Yeon; Lee, Se Uk; Lee, Tae Rim; Cha, Won Chul; Shin, Tae Gun; Sim, Min Seob; Jo, Ik Joon",J Korean Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5546975/,244
4633,PPARγ and Its Agonists in Chronic Kidney Disease,2020-02-25,"Recent global advocacy efforts have highlighted the importance of development of a vaccine against group A Streptococcus (GAS). Combo5 is a non-M protein-based vaccine that provides protection against GAS skin infection in mice and reduces the severity of pharyngitis in nonhuman primates. However, Combo5 with the addition of aluminum hydroxide (alum) as an adjuvant failed to protect against invasive GAS infection of mice. Here, we show that formulation of Combo5 with adjuvants containing saponin QS21 significantly improves protective efficacy, even though all 7 adjuvants tested generated high antigen-specific IgG antibody titers, including alum. Detailed characterization of Combo5 formulated with SMQ adjuvant, a squalene-in-water emulsion containing a TLR4 agonist and QS21, showed significant differences from the results obtained with alum in IgG subclasses generated following immunization, with an absence of GAS opsonizing antibodies. SMQ, but not alum, generated strong interleukin-6 (IL-6), gamma interferon (IFN-γ), and tumor necrosis alpha (TNF-α) responses. This work highlights the importance of adjuvant selection for non-M protein-based GAS vaccines to optimize immune responses and protective efficacy.","Rivera-Hernandez, Tania; Rhyme, Mira Syahira; Cork, Amanda J.; Jones, Scott; Segui-Perez, Celia; Brunner, Livia; Richter, Johanna; Petrovsky, Nikolai; Lawrenz, Maria; Goldblatt, David; Collin, Nicolas; Walker, Mark J.",mBio,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7064752/,244
4802,Journal of Clinical Monitoring and Computing end of year summary 2019: hemodynamic monitoring and management,2020-03-14,"BACKGROUND: Since the declaration of the 10th Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak in DRC on 1st Aug 2018, several neighboring countries have been developing and implementing preparedness efforts to prevent EVD cross-border transmission to enable timely detection, investigation, and response in the event of a confirmed EVD outbreak in the country. We describe Uganda’s experience in EVD preparedness. RESULTS: On 4 August 2018, the Uganda Ministry of Health (MoH) activated the Public Health Emergency Operations Centre (PHEOC) and the National Task Force (NTF) for public health emergencies to plan, guide, and coordinate EVD preparedness in the country. The NTF selected an Incident Management Team (IMT), constituting a National Rapid Response Team (NRRT) that supported activation of the District Task Forces (DTFs) and District Rapid Response Teams (DRRTs) that jointly assessed levels of preparedness in 30 designated high-risk districts representing category 1 (20 districts) and category 2 (10 districts). The MoH, with technical guidance from the World Health Organisation (WHO), led EVD preparedness activities and worked together with other ministries and partner organisations to enhance community-based surveillance systems, develop and disseminate risk communication messages, engage communities, reinforce EVD screening and infection prevention measures at Points of Entry (PoEs) and in high-risk health facilities, construct and equip EVD isolation and treatment units, and establish coordination and procurement mechanisms. CONCLUSION: As of 31 May 2019, there was no confirmed case of EVD as Uganda has continued to make significant and verifiable progress in EVD preparedness. There is a need to sustain these efforts, not only in EVD preparedness but also across the entire spectrum of a multi-hazard framework. These efforts strengthen country capacity and compel the country to avail resources for preparedness and management of incidents at the source while effectively cutting costs of using a “fire-fighting” approach during public health emergencies.","Aceng, Jane Ruth; Ario, Alex R.; Muruta, Allan N.; Makumbi, Issa; Nanyunja, Miriam; Komakech, Innocent; Bakainaga, Andrew N.; Talisuna, Ambrose O.; Mwesigye, Collins; Mpairwe, Allan M.; Tusiime, Jayne B.; Lali, William Z.; Katushabe, Edson; Ocom, Felix; Kaggwa, Mugagga; Bongomin, Bodo; Kasule, Hafisa; Mwoga, Joseph N.; Sensasi, Benjamin; Mwebembezi, Edmund; Katureebe, Charles; Sentumbwe, Olive; Nalwadda, Rita; Mbaka, Paul; Fatunmbi, Bayo S.; Nakiire, Lydia; Lamorde, Mohammed; Walwema, Richard; Kambugu, Andrew; Nanyondo, Judith; Okware, Solome; Ahabwe, Peter B.; Nabukenya, Immaculate; Kayiwa, Joshua; Wetaka, Milton M.; Kyazze, Simon; Kwesiga, Benon; Kadobera, Daniel; Bulage, Lilian; Nanziri, Carol; Monje, Fred; Aliddeki, Dativa M.; Ntono, Vivian; Gonahasa, Doreen; Nabatanzi, Sandra; Nsereko, Godfrey; Nakinsige, Anne; Mabumba, Eldard; Lubwama, Bernard; Sekamatte, Musa; Kibuule, Michael; Muwanguzi, David; Amone, Jackson; Upenytho, George D.; Driwale, Alfred; Seru, Morries; Sebisubi, Fred; Akello, Harriet; Kabanda, Richard; Mutengeki, David K.; Bakyaita, Tabley; Serwanjja, Vivian N.; Okwi, Richard; Okiria, Jude; Ainebyoona, Emmanuel; Opar, Bernard T.; Mimbe, Derrick; Kyabaggu, Denis; Ayebazibwe, Chrisostom; Sentumbwe, Juliet; Mwanja, Moses; Ndumu, Deo B.; Bwogi, Josephine; Balinandi, Stephen; Nyakarahuka, Luke; Tumusiime, Alex; Kyondo, Jackson; Mulei, Sophia; Lutwama, Julius; Kaleebu, Pontiano; Kagirita, Atek; Nabadda, Susan; Oumo, Peter; Lukwago, Robinah; Kasozi, Julius; Masylukov, Oleh; Kyobe, Henry Bosa; Berdaga, Viorica; Lwanga, Miriam; Opio, Joe C.; Matseketse, David; Eyul, James; Oteba, Martin O.; Bukirwa, Hasifa; Bulya, Nulu; Masiira, Ben; Kihembo, Christine; Ohuabunwo, Chima; Antara, Simon N.; Owembabazi, Wilberforce; Okot, Paul B.; Okwera, Josephine; Amoros, Isabelle; Kajja, Victoria; Mukunda, Basnet S.; Sorela, Isabel; Adams, Gregory; Shoemaker, Trevor; Klena, John D.; Taboy, Celine H.; Ward, Sarah E.; Merrill, Rebecca D.; Carter, Rosalind J.; Harris, Julie R.; Banage, Flora; Nsibambi, Thomas; Ojwang, Joseph; Kasule, Juliet N.; Stowell, Dan F.; Brown, Vance R.; Zhu, Bao-Ping; Homsy, Jaco; Nelson, Lisa J.; Tusiime, Patrick K.; Olaro, Charles; Mwebesa, Henry G.; Woldemariam, Yonas Tegegn",Global Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7081536/,244

10608,Nurses transforming systems of care: The bicentennial of Florence Nightingale's legacy,2020-04-10,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of NT-814, a dual neurokinin 1,3 antagonist, in postmenopausal women with vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes). METHODS: We completed a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in three US clinical research units in 76 postmenopausal women with moderate/severe hot flashes. Participants were randomized to 14 days of once-daily NT-814 or placebo within each of four sequential dose cohorts; 50, 100, 150, and 300 mg. Participants completed diaries of hot flash frequency and severity and waking due to night sweats before (baseline) and during treatment. RESULTS: All prespecified efficacy parameters (24-h hot flash frequency and severity, frequency of waking due to night sweats) decreased in all groups (including placebo). Mean reduction from baseline at week 2 in moderate/severe hot flash frequency was 37% in the placebo group and, respectively, 24% (P = 0.048 vs placebo), 59% (P = 0.155), 84% (P < 0.001) and 66% (P = 0.022) in the 50 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, and 300 mg NT-814 groups; in waking due to night sweats reduction was 20% (P = 0.059), 55% (P = 0.135), 81% (P < 0.001), and 63% (P = 0.031) in the NT-814 groups and 32% in the placebo group. The improvement with NT-814 ≥150 mg was also evident in the first week of treatment. The most common treatment-related adverse events were mild somnolence and headache, more frequently in the 300 mg group. Safety monitoring identified no concerns. CONCLUSIONS: Once-daily NT-814 (≥150 mg/d) resulted in a rapid, marked improvement in hot flashes and waking due to night sweats. No safety concerns were identified. Doses up to 300 mg were well tolerated.","Trower, Mike; Anderson, Richard A.; Ballantyne, Elizabeth; Joffe, Hadine; Kerr, Mary; Pawsey, Steve",Menopause,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7188053/,244
11163,Longer term hemodialysis-dependent chronic renal failure increases the risk of post-cardiac surgery vasoplegic syndrome,2020-01-03,"Statins, widely prescribed for cardiovascular diseases, are also being eyed for management of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Poor bioavailability and blood-aqueous barrier may however limit significant ocular concentration of statins following oral administration. We for the first time propose and investigate local application of atorvastatin (ATS; representative statin) loaded into solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), as self-administrable eye drops. Insolubility, instability, and high molecular weight > 500 of ATS, and ensuring that SLNs reach posterior eye were the challenges to be met. ATS-SLNs, developed (2339/DEL/2014) using suitable components, quality-by-design (QBD) approach, and scalable hot high-pressure homogenization, were characterized and evaluated comprehensively for ocular suitability. ATS-SLNs were 8 and 12 times more bioavailable (AUC) in aqueous and vitreous humor, respectively, than free ATS. Three-tier (in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo) ocular safety, higher corneal flux (2.5-fold), and improved stability (13.62 times) including photostability of ATS on incorporation in ATS-SLNs were established. Autoclavability and aqueous nature are the other highlights of ATS-SLNs. Presence of intact fluorescein-labeled SLNs (F-SLNs) in internal eye tissues post–in vivo application as eye drops provides direct evidence of successful delivery. Perinuclear fluorescence in ARPE-19 cells confirms the effective uptake of F-SLNs. Prolonged residence, up to 7 h, was attributed to the mucus-penetrating nature of ATS-SLNs.

11645,Derivation and validation of a prognostic score for neonatal mortality in Ethiopia: a case-control study,2020-05-20,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is a highly contagious, intestinal infectious disease caused by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). PEDV as an emerging and re-emerging epizootic virus of swine causes substantial economic losses to the pig industry in China and other countries. In China, the occurrence of PED shows significant seasonal variations, usually outbreak during the winter season. The epidemic characteristics of PED may be highly correlated with the changes of ambient temperature. However, molecular mechanism on the seasonal occurrence of PED still remains unclear. It has been widely observed that low ambient temperature up-regulates the expression of host heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70). Here, we showed that nucleotide and protein levels of Hsp70 were up-regulated in the intestinal of cold exposed pig and cold exposed Vero E6 cells. We found that overexpression of Hsp70 could increase PEDV mRNA synthesis and protein expression in Vero E6 and IPEC-J2 cells, while the siRNAs mediated knockdown of Hsp70 and VER155008 mediated inhibition of Hsp70 resulted in inhibition of viral mRNA synthesis and protein expression in Vero E6 cells. These data suggested that Hsp70 positively regulated PEDV mRNA synthesis and protein expression, which being helpful for understanding the seasonality of PED epidemics and development of novel antiviral therapies in the future.","Kong, Fanzhi; Xu, Yaru; Ran, Wei; Yin, Baishuang; Feng, Li; Sun, Dongbo",Pathogens,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7237993/,244

This prodrug is activated and converted to an active form, Pyrazinoic acid (POA), by Pyrazinamidase (PZase) enzyme. Mtb resistance to PZA is the outcome of mutations frequently reported in pncA, rpsA, and panD genes. Among the mentioned genes, pncA mutations contribute to 72–99% of the total resistance to PZA. Thus, considering the vital importance of this gene in PZA resistance, its frequent mutations (D49N, Y64S, W68G, and F94A) were investigated through in-depth computational techniques to put conclusions that might be useful for new scaffolds design or structure optimization to improve the efficacy of the available drugs. Mutants and wild type PZase were used in extensive and long-run molecular dynamics simulations in triplicate to disclose the resistance mechanism induced by the above-mentioned point mutations. Our analysis suggests that these mutations alter the internal dynamics of PZase and hinder the correct orientation of PZA to the enzyme. Consequently, the PZA has a low binding energy score with the mutants compared with the wild type PZase. These mutations were also reported to affect the binding of Fe(2+) ion and its coordinated residues. Conformational dynamics also revealed that β-strand two is flipped, which is significant in Fe(2+) binding. MM-GBSA analysis confirmed that these mutations significantly decreased the binding of PZA. In conclusion, these mutations cause conformation alterations and deformities that lead to PZA resistance.","Nangraj, Asma Sindhoo; Khan, Abbas; Umbreen, Shaheena; Sahar, Sana; Arshad, Maryam; Younas, Saba; Ahmad, Sajjad; Ali, Shahid; Ali, Syed Shujait; Ali, Liaqat; Wei, Dong-Qing",Front Mol Biosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8174790/,244

19193,"Caution, not causality: The limitations of risk factor and outcome research on ventilator-associated events",2021-05-03,"IMPORTANCE: In the treatment of type 2 diabetes, evidence of the comparative effectiveness of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors vs sulfonylureas—the second most widely used antihyperglycemic class after metformin—is lacking. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the comparative effectiveness of SGLT2 inhibitors and sulfonylureas associated with the risk of all-cause mortality among patients with type 2 diabetes using metformin. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cohort study used data from the US Department of Veterans Affairs compared the use of SGLT2 inhibitors vs sulfonylureas in individuals receiving metformin for treatment of type 2 diabetes. A total of 23 870 individuals with new use of SGLT2 inhibitors and 104 423 individuals with new use of sulfonylureas were enrolled between October 1, 2016, and February 29, 2020, and followed up until January 31, 2021. EXPOSURES: New use of SGLT2 inhibitors or sulfonylureas. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: This study examined the outcome of all-cause mortality. Predefined variables and covariates identified by a high-dimensional variable selection algorithm were used to build propensity scores. The overlap weighting method based on the propensity scores was used to estimate the intention-to-treat effect sizes of SGLT2 inhibitor compared with sulfonylurea therapy. The inverse probability of the treatment adherence weighting method was used to estimate the per-protocol effect sizes. RESULTS: Among the 128 293 participants (mean [SD] age, 64.60 [9.84] years; 122 096 [95.17%] men), 23 870 received an SGLT2 inhibitor and 104 423 received a sulfonylurea. Compared with sulfonylureas, SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with reduced risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 0.81; 95% CI, 0.75-0.87), yielding an event rate difference of −5.15 (95% CI, −7.16 to −3.02) deaths per 1000 person-years. Compared with sulfonylureas, SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with a reduced risk of death, regardless of cardiovascular disease status, in several categories of estimated glomerular filtration rate (including rates from >90 to ≤30 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) and in participants with no albuminuria (albumin to creatinine ratio [ACR] ≤30 mg/g), microalbuminuria (ACR >30 to ≤300 mg/g), and macroalbuminuria (ACR >300 mg/g). In per-protocol analyses, continued use of SGLT2 inhibitors was associated with a reduced risk of death compared with continued use of sulfonylureas (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.60-0.74; event rate difference, −10.10; 95% CI, −12.97 to −7.24 deaths per 1000 person-years). In additional per-protocol analyses, continued use of SGLT2 inhibitors with metformin was associated with a reduced risk of death compared with SGLT2 inhibitor treatment without metformin (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.50-0.97; event rate difference, −7.62; 95% CI, −17.12 to −0.48 deaths per 1000 person-years). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this comparative effectiveness study analyzing data from the US Department of Veterans Affairs, among patients with type 2 diabetes receiving metformin therapy, SGLT2 inhibitor treatment was associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality compared with sulfonylureas. The results provide data from a real-world setting that might help guide the choice of antihyperglycemic therapy.","Xie, Yan; Bowe, Benjamin; Gibson, Andrew K.; McGill, Janet B.; Maddukuri, Geetha; Al-Aly, Ziyad",JAMA Internal Medicine,https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/articlepdf/2781475/jamainternal_xie_2021_oi_210025_1624288250.50619.pdf,244

Currently, video is a tool that is available to a large part of the population and is simple to use. This audio-visual format has many advantages such as its low cost, speed of dissemination, and possible interaction between users. For these reasons, it is a tool with high dissemination and educational potential, which could be used in the field of health for learning about and management of chronic diseases by adult patients. OBJECTIVE: The following review determines whether the use of health educational videos by adult patients with chronic diseases is effective for their self-management according to the literature. METHODS: An electronic literature search of the PubMed, CINAHL, and MEDLINE (via the EBSCOhost platform) databases up to April 2020 was conducted. The systematic scoping review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) methodology. RESULTS: After reviewing 1427 articles, 12 were selected as the most consistent with the proposed inclusion criteria. After their review, it was found that the studies showed that video is effective as a tool for improving care related to chronic diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Video is effective in improving the care and quality of life for patients with chronic diseases, whether the initiative for using video came from their health care professionals or themselves.","Navarro, Olga; Escrivá, Marta; Faubel, Raquel; Traver, Vicente",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8292934/,244
19771,Qualitative indications for tracheostomy and chronic mechanical ventilation in patients with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia,2021-08-04,"BACKGROUND: Road traffic crashes related (RTCR) chest traumas remain important global public health challenge. The impact of boosting market of automobile vehicles in China during last decade on thoracic injury needs to be defined. This study aimed to review and analyze the demographic and clinical characteristics of RTCR thoracic injuries in China. METHODS: Clinical records of patients with thoracic trauma admitted to thoracic surgery department between January 2003 and June 2020 were retrospectively retrieved and reviewed. Patients’ profiles and clinical characteristics were comparatively analyzed between road traffic crashes caused injury and other injury mechanisms, and in RTCR chest trauma patients before January 2011 (2003 group), and after January 2011 (2011 group), when is considered as the beginning year of Chinese household vehicle era. RESULTS: The study included 5095 thoracic trauma patients with mean age of 50.2 years, of whom 79.4% were male. Most of the patients (70.3%, n = 3583) had rib fractures. Associated injuries were present in 52.0% of the patients, of them 78.5% (n = 2080) were extremity fractures. Road traffic crashes accounted for 41.4% (n = 2108) of the injuries, most of them (98.0%) were related to motor vehicles. In comparison with other chest trauma mechanisms, RTCR chest injuries affected females and older males more frequently, with a higher incidence of rib fractures and sternum fractures, and higher injury severity scores (ISS) (all p < 0.05). Surgeries were required in 1495 (70.9%) patients of the RRTCR chest traumas, while the majority of non-RTCR thoracic injuries were managed conservatively or with tube thoracostomy (30.2%, n = 901). RTCR chest traumas caused longer hospital stay (13.0 ± 9.6 days vs. 11.8 ± 7.4 days, p = 0.001), higher ICU usage (30.7% vs. 19.6%, p = 0.001), higher rate of ventilator support (12.9% vs. 7.5%, p = 0.001), and higher mortalities (3.8% vs. 1.6%, p = 0.005) than that of non-RTRA chest injuries. For RTCR patients, when compared with 2003 group, 2011 group had similar patterns in terms of accident category, associated injury and treatment. However, 2011 group had more females (38.5% vs. 18.0%, p = 0.001) and older males (50.6 ± 9.7 vs. 47.9 ± 17.2, p = 0.001), with a higher ISS (18.3 ± 10.2 vs. 17.1 ± 8.9, p = 0.004), and fewer were managed with chest tubes (25.0% vs. 29.2%, p = 0.031). Clinical outcomes were not significantly different between the groups in terms of hospital length of stay, intensive care unit (ICU) usage, ICU length of stay, duration of ventilator hours and mortality. However, the 2011 group had more patients requiring ventilator support (14.4% vs. 10.6%, p = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: Road traffic crashes remain to be the major etiology of thoracic injuries in China, which usually affects middle-aged males, causing rib fractures with concomitant injuries frequently occurring to other organ systems. Treatments mainly include tube thoracotomy and surgical procedures. Although the clinical characteristics and outcomes of traffic accident related chest traumas are largely unchanged in spite of the rapid increasing numbers of motor vehicles, variations in the pattern of injuries by gender, age, injury severity and ventilator usage may still provide important information for targeted management.","Zhang, Shengcao; Xiao, Xiangzhi; Wang, Jian; Hu, Chengkai; Du, Qiancheng; Fu, Zheng; Cai, Wei; Zhang, Zhilong; Chen, Hao",J Cardiothorac Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8335466/,244
20172,The antioncogenic effect of Beclin-1 and FOXP3 is associated with SKP2 expression in gastric adenocarcinoma,2021-08-20,"BACKGROUND: Machine learning techniques are increasingly being applied in health research. It is not clear how useful these approaches are for modeling continuous outcomes. Child quality of life is associated with parental socioeconomic status and physical activity and may be associated with aerobic fitness and strength. It is unclear whether diet or academic performance is associated with quality of life. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the predictive performance of machine learning techniques with that of linear regression in examining the extent to which continuous outcomes (physical activity, aerobic fitness, muscular strength, diet, and parental education) are predictive of academic performance and quality of life and whether academic performance and quality of life are associated. METHODS: We modeled data from children attending 9 schools in a quasi-experimental study. We split data randomly into training and validation sets. Curvilinear, nonlinear, and heteroscedastic variables were simulated to examine the performance of machine learning techniques compared to that of linear models, with and without imputation. RESULTS: We included data for 1711 children. Regression models explained 24% of academic performance variance in the real complete-case validation set, and up to 15% in quality of life. While machine learning techniques explained high proportions of variance in training sets, in validation, machine learning techniques explained approximately 0% of academic performance and 3% to 8% of quality of life. With imputation, machine learning techniques improved to 15% for academic performance. Machine learning outperformed regression for simulated nonlinear and heteroscedastic variables. The best predictors of academic performance in adjusted models were the child’s mother having a master-level education (P<.001; β=1.98, 95% CI 0.25 to 3.71), increased television and computer use (P=.03; β=1.19, 95% CI 0.25 to 3.71), and dichotomized self-reported exercise (P=.001; β=2.47, 95% CI 1.08 to 3.87). For quality of life, self-reported exercise (P<.001; β=1.09, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.66) and increased television and computer use (P=.002; β=−0.95, 95% CI −1.55 to −0.36) were the best predictors. Adjusted academic performance was associated with quality of life (P=.02; β=0.12, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.22). CONCLUSIONS: Linear regression was less prone to overfitting and outperformed commonly used machine learning techniques. Imputation improved the performance of machine learning, but not sufficiently to outperform regression. Machine learning techniques outperformed linear regression for modeling nonlinear and heteroscedastic relationships and may be of use in such cases. Regression with splines performed almost as well in nonlinear modeling. Lifestyle variables, including physical exercise, television and computer use, and parental education are predictive of academic performance or quality of life. Academic performance is associated with quality of life after adjusting for lifestyle variables and may offer another promising intervention target to improve quality of life in children.","Froud, Robert; Hansen, Solveig Hakestad; Ruud, Hans Kristian; Foss, Jonathan; Ferguson, Leila; Fredriksen, Per Morten",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8325075/,244

Furthermore, KSHV dysregulates numerous metabolic sensors including mTOR, AMPK, CASTOR1 and sirtuins to maintain cellular energetic homeostasis during infection and in KSHV-induced cancers. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in the understanding of KSHV hijacking of metabolic pathways and sensors, providing insights into the molecular basis of KSHV infection and KSHV-induced oncogenesis. In addition, we highlight the critical metabolic targets and sensors for developing potential new therapies against KSHV infection and KSHV-induced cancers.","Li, Tingting; Gao, Shou-Jiang",Cell Biosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8475840/,244
21827,Association of Oral Anticoagulation With Stroke in Atrial Fibrillation or Heart Failure: A Comparative Meta-Analysis,2021-07-20,"BACKGROUND: Nurses frequently encounter ethically challenging situations in everyday practice. In these situations, nurses often know an appropriate course of action to take but are unable to do so. Many studies have examined the ethically challenging situations faced by nurses, but how nurses cope with these situations is not well understood. Therefore, this study aims to explore the coping strategies used or adopted in ethically challenging situations by expert nurses in South Korea. METHODS: Participants were recruited via purposive sampling. Small group interviews were conducted with 26 expert registered nurses in a general hospital in South Korea. The data were analyzed using Giorgi’s descriptive phenomenological method. RESULTS: The essential theme of nurses’ experience of coping with ethically challenging situations was “being faithful to the nature of caring.” This essential theme comprised three themes: self-monitoring of ethical insensitivity, maintaining honesty, and actively acting as an advocate. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that the coping strategies of expert nurses are mostly consistent with the attributes of ethical competence as previously defined in healthcare, and expert nurses can address ethically challenging situations in an effective and ethical manner by faithfully adhering to the spirit of caring. System-wide early counseling and interventions should be considered for nurses who have experienced ethical difficulties.","Kim, Yeon Hee; Kang, Young-ah; Ok, Jeong Hui; Choe, Kwisoon",BMC Nurs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8479722/,244

Recognition of this disease requires a high index of suspicion. Diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies have been expanded and refined in recent years. SUMMARY: HIT is a condition where antibodies against the heparin/platelet factor 4 complex interact with platelet receptors to promote platelet activation, aggregation, and thrombus formation. Our review will focus on intraoperative and postoperative considerations related to HIT to help the clinician better manage this rare but often devastating hypercoagulable disease process.","Moreno-Duarte, Ingrid; Ghadimi, Kamrouz",Curr Anesthesiol Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7455512/,244

In providing an automated intelligent computing solution to select the appropriate CP for the most critical patients with COVID-19, two challenges aspects are bound to be faced: (1) distributed hospital management aspects (including scalability and management issues for prioritising COVID-19 patients and donors simultaneously), and (2) technical aspects (including the lack of COVID-19 dataset availability of patients and donors and an accurate matching process amongst them considering all blood types). Based on previous reports, no study has provided a solution for CP-transfusion-rescue intelligent framework during this pandemic that has addressed said challenges and issues. This study aimed to propose a novel CP-transfusion intelligent framework for rescuing COVID-19 patients across centralised/decentralised telemedicine hospitals based on the matching component process to provide an efficient CP from eligible donors to the most critical patients using multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) methods. A dataset, including COVID-19 patients/donors that have met the important criteria in the virology field, must be augmented to improve the developed framework. Four consecutive phases conclude the methodology. In the first phase, a new COVID-19 dataset is generated on the basis of medical-reference ranges by specialised experts in the virology field. The simulation data are classified into 80 patients and 80 donors on the basis of the five biomarker criteria with four blood types (i.e., A, B, AB, and O) and produced for COVID-19 case study. In the second phase, the identification scenario of patient/donor distributions across four centralised/decentralised telemedicine hospitals is identified ‘as a proof of concept’. In the third phase, three stages are conducted to develop a CP-transfusion-rescue framework. In the first stage, two decision matrices are adopted and developed on the basis of the five ‘serological/protein biomarker’ criteria for the prioritisation of patient/donor lists. In the second stage, MCDM techniques are analysed to adopt individual and group decision making based on integrated AHP-TOPSIS as suitable methods. In the third stage, the intelligent matching components amongst patients/donors are developed on the basis of four distinct rules. In the final phase, the guideline of the objective validation steps is reported. The intelligent framework implies the benefits and strength weights of biomarker criteria to the priority configuration results and can obtain efficient CPs for the most critical patients. The execution of matching components possesses the scalability and balancing presentation within centralised/decentralised hospitals. The objective validation results indicate that the ranking is valid.","Mohammed, Thura J.; Albahri, A. S.; Zaidan, A. A.; Albahri, O. S.; Al-Obaidi, Jameel R.; Zaidan, B.

47930,169 Online CME is Successful at Improving Knowledge Related to Emerging Agents for Hepatorenal Syndrome by Nephrologists,2021-03-19,"Human health is an uncompromising substance. The word “health” refers to a state of complete emotional and physical well-being. Health can be defined as physical, mental, and social wellbeing, and as a resource for living a full life. It refers not only to the absence of disease, but the ability to recover and bounce back from illness and other problems. Medical tourism is the concept of traveling far and wide for better medical treatment. It is an economic activity that entails trade in services and represents the mixing of two of the largest world industries: medicine and tourism. The globalization of the health care sector and the massive demand for low cost-high quality treatment in recent times has caught the attention of many developing countries that have the adequate resources and potential to meet these demands. The main purpose of the paper is to evaluate present status of medical tourism in Bangladesh and based on strengths, weakness, opportunities and threats to develop a strategic one-stop service model. We hypothesized that the key competitive advantages of Bangladesh in medical tourism stem from the following: low cost advantage in treatment, low tuition fee in medical education, opportunities of many diversified treatments such as medical, dental, surgical, paramedical, Ayurveda, homeopathic, acupuncture care etc. and the diversity of tourist destinations available in the country. Two surveys were done: One from the patients and other from the doctors. Furthermore, some doctors and medical technologists were interviewed face to face. Having collected all the qualitative and quantitative data, we have done appropriate analysis and apply relevant statistical tests of significance to ensure validity and reliability of result.

47933,98 Severe Hypophosphatemia After Iron Infusion: A Serious Complication,2021-03-19,"The growth of tourism depends on the extent to which tourist appreciate offered hospitality by the host country. More generally, it is accepted that tourists are more willing to spend their moments in regions with good hospitality. This paper investigated the relevance of this hypothetical intuition using the case of Bangladesh. This is the fundamental logic behind undertaking this investigation. The hospitality industry is a noteworthy service industry in the world economy; it incorporates services like food service, hotels and tourism. We proposed that, among individuals, the willingness to consider tourism is constrained by positive changes in hospitality. Firstly, this paper probed the association between emotions regarding hospitality among tourists and tourism in Bangladesh. Secondly, it investigated the extent to which changes in hospitality impact the willingness of considering tourism in Bangladesh. Thirdly, this paper examined the extent to which tourists in Bangladesh are responsive to external and internal factors of tourism and hospitality. A survey was organized to collect data on target tourists visiting the tourist’s places such as hill tracts, sea beaches/islands, and residing three/five star hotels in Bangladesh. We measured some qualitative factors of emotions regrinding hospitality and willingness to consider tourism. We determined the internal factors and focus on “PESTEL Theory of Marketing” to analyse and monitored the macro-environmental (external marketing environment) factors that have an impact on tourism. Finally, we proposed a tourism and hospitality model based on our outcome. Our findings identified the current conditions and perceptions regarding tourism and hospitality in Bangladesh. The tourism industry is completely dependent on the hospitality industry. Visitors coming to visit Bangladesh wish to have peace, good environment, best quality products and services.

To analyse person movement and consequently assess the patient’s condition, an effective methodology is presented that is two-fold: initially, Kinect-based action representations are constructed from handcrafted 3DHOG depth features and the descriptive power of a Fisher encoding scheme. This is complemented by wearable sensor data analysis, using time domain features and then boosted by exploring fusion strategies of minimum expense.

Although this comes with a lot of benefits, it also comes with a number of undesirable consequences. Chief among these consequences is the rising concerns for security of information and even loss of privacy. Steganography, an Information hiding technique could be a fitting solution to these security issues. This paper presents an improved Steganography technique for ensuring the security of the widely spread and used internet materials or information that are shared globally with risk of vulnerability of attack. In this current research work, Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) Steganography were combined together to achieve effective security in the proposed system. A given plain text or secret message is first converted to a cipher text using ECC. The resultant encrypted text is then hidden under a cover-image using DCT-based image steganography technique to produce a final output called stego-image. To the Human Visual System (HVS), the stego-image remains the same as the original cover image. This ensures that the hidden secret message gets delivered to the target recipient without any suspicion. Standard metrics such as Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Mean Square Error (MSE), as well as average computation time, were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed steganography system. The results indicate better performance compared to the conventional steganography systems. Thus the proposed system is a 2-level steganography system effective for storing sensitive data and even for securely transferring information over an open/enterprise network.","Gabriel, Arome Junior; Adetunmbi, Adebayo Olusola; Obaila, Preye",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974956/,244
52370,Management of Recurrent Deep Vein Thrombosis in a Transgender Woman,2021-05-03,"INTRODUCTION: With increased litigation and media attention around the consent process it is vital we ensure patients understand what their operation entails prior to surgery. North Bristol Trust has recently started using EIDO consent leaflets; currently used in 50% of NHS hospitals . Our aim was to calculate how many patients received EIDO healthcare consent leaflets and whether this affected their experience of the consent process. METHOD: Questionnaires made up of Likert scale and open ended questions were distributed to patients undergoing Upper GI surgery on the day of their operation. The questionnaire explored whether patients received an EIDO leaflet pre-operatively, their understanding of the risks and benefits and their satisfaction with the consent process. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare responses from the included patients. RESULTS: 12 patients received EIDO leaflets during their pre-operative consultation, six did not. Compared with those that did not, patients who received a leaflet had a better understanding of the risks (p = 0.002), benefits (p = 0.008) and details of the operation (p = 0.005) and were happier with the consent process (p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Including EIDO leaflets in the consent process helps ensure patients making an informed decision and improves the smooth running of theatre lists. We are currently introducing EIDO consent leaflets throughout general surgery for emergency operations and when sending out dates of elective operations. We aim to review the use of these leaflets as the consent process becomes increasingly difficult due to COVID 19 and the lack of face to face interaction.","Lythgoe, M P; Condie, Natalie",BJS Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8083505/,244
52605,A Case of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion Syndrome Associated With COVID-19 Pneumonia Treated With Boluses of Hypertonic Saline for Reversal of Symptomatic Hyponatremia,2021-05-03,"Injectable hydrogels as an important class of biomaterials have gained much attention in tissue engineering. However, their crosslinking degree is difficult to be controlled after being injected into body. As we all know, the crosslinking degree strongly influences the physicochemical properties of hydrogels. Therefore, developing an injectable hydrogel with tunable crosslinking degree in vivo is important for tissue engineering. Herein, we present a dual crosslinking strategy to prepare injectable hydrogels with step-by-step tunable crosslinking degree using Schiff base reaction and photopolymerization. The developed hyaluronic acid/poly(γ-glutamic acid) (HA/γ-PGA) hydrogels exhibit step-by-step tunable swelling behavior, enzymatic degradation behavior and mechanical properties. Mechanical performance tests show that the storage moduli of HA/γ-PGA hydrogels are all less than 2000 Pa and the compressive moduli are in kilopascal, which have a good match with soft tissue. In addition, NIH 3T3 cells encapsulated in HA/γ-PGA hydrogel exhibit a high cell viability, indicating a good cytocompatibility of HA/γ-PGA hydrogel. Therefore, the developed HA/γ-PGA hydrogel as an injectable biomaterial has a good potential in soft tissue engineering.

54841,Transcriptome profiling of the diaphragm in a controlled mechanical ventilation model reveals key genes involved in ventilator-induced diaphragmatic dysfunction,2021-06-25,"This paper presents the model system QINFORGE. By taking into account occupational mobility matrices, the model is able to show adaptation reactions between labour supply and demand at the occupational level in the short- and long-term. We use the model to illustrate the effects of the COVID-19 crisis on employment and remuneration opportunities in occupations. For this purpose, we compare two scenarios. On the one hand, a “counterfactual scenario” extrapolates long-term behaviour and trends starting from the year 2019. The “baseline projection”, on the other hand, models the economic situation in the short term at the industry level. This stimulates model-based behavioural changes at the occupational level. The crisis will set back Germany’s economic performance by three years in the long-term. As the worsening labour market situation will also cause lower labour participation rates, especially among women, the number of the projected unemployed in the “baseline projection” for 2020 and 2021 will only rise by around 400,000 compared with the “counterfactual scenario”. In the long term, however, the scarce supply of labour will be an inhibiting factor for economic growth. In addition, the crisis will inhibit overall wage growth in the short and medium term The results of the model show that occupations in gastronomy, tourism, and art and culture are particularly affected by the crisis. From 2025, however, the wage and employment levels that would have been achieved in the “counterfactual scenario” will be reached. By contrast, the short-term wage increases in the health care occupations are anticipatory effects. In the long-term, the baseline-projection does not forecast higher wage levels than the “counterfactual scenario”. Nevertheless, the labour supply in the health care occupations, especially in nursing, could increase in the long term because of the crisis. However, this will be because the COVID 19 pandemic may reduce the employment and wage opportunities that are available to health care professionals outside of the health care sector.","Maier, Tobias; Mönnig, Anke; Zika, Gerd",AStA Wirtsch Sozialstat Arch,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8215489/,244

It causes insufficient medical services and a latent fiscal threat to the Nation Health Insurance (NHI). This study adopted simulation-based educating modules to explore the effect in teaching competence among primary and middle school teachers for efficient AEDRU (adequate emergency department resource usage) education in the future. METHOD: The subjects were 414 elementary and junior high school teachers in Taiwan. 214 participants attended the simulation-based workshop as the simulation-based group, whereas 200 participants took an online self-learning module as the self-learning group. The workshop was created by an expert panel for decreasing the unnecessary usage amount of ED medial resources. The materials are lecture, board games, miniature ED modules, and simulation-based scenarios. A teaching competence questionnaire including ED knowledge, teaching attitude, teaching skills, and teaching self-efficacy was conducted among participants before and after the intervention. Data were analyzed via McNemar, paired t test and the generalized estimating equations (GEE). RESULTS: The study showed that teachers who participated in the simulation-based workshop had improved more in teaching competence than those who received the online self-learning module. In addition, there were significant differences between the pre-test and post-test among the two groups in teaching competence. CONCLUSION: The simulation-based workshop is effective and it should be spread out. When students know how to use ED medical resources properly, they could affect their families. It can help the ED service to be used properly and benefits the finance of the NHI. The health care cost will be managed while also improving health.","Lin, Geng-Shiau; Tseng, Pei-Ling; Chang, Chia-Chen; Yiang, Giou-Teng; Yen, Zui-Shen; Jian, Jang-Wei; Tung, Chen-Yin",Medicine (Baltimore),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8448039/,244

It involves the active involvement in search and rescue to reconstruction that people affected by disasters undertake unsolicited. Predictive power in disaster recovery has further increased its relevance. However, quantitative analysis that community participation has on disaster mitigation measures is scant. The study analyses community participation’s impact on disaster mitigation measures following the Kochi flood of 2018 and 2019 in India. We use a Multivariate Probit Regression model with a sample size of 750 to analyse the relationship between disaster mitigation measures (namely, disaster event planning, previous experience, following disaster-related news closely, and neighbourhood relationship) and community participation. The results show participants who were active in community events were 23% more likely to adopt all the disaster mitigation measures than those who did not. In addition, households with special needs members were more likely to be prepared for an unanticipated event. The results also showed higher education levels directly correlated to implementing more significant disaster mitigation measures. Implications for government policy formation include schemes to enhance community rehabilitation and promote social participation to mitigate future disaster events.","Ali, Sameer; George, Abraham",Nat Hazards (Dordr),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8488920/,244

Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA) has the largest number of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) cases in Mexico and is at risk of exceeding its hospital capacity in early 2021. Methods. We used the Stanford-CIDE Coronavirus Simulation Model (SC-COSMO), a dynamic transmission model of COVID-19, to evaluate the effect of policies considering increased contacts during the end-of-year holidays, intensification of physical distancing, and school reopening on projected confirmed cases and deaths, hospital demand, and hospital capacity exceedance. Model parameters were derived from primary data, literature, and calibrated. Results. Following high levels of holiday contacts even with no in-person schooling, MCMA will have 0.9 million (95% prediction interval 0.3–1.6) additional COVID-19 cases between December 7, 2020, and March 7, 2021, and hospitalizations will peak at 26,000 (8,300–54,500) on January 25, 2021, with a 97% chance of exceeding COVID-19-specific capacity (9,667 beds). If MCMA were to control holiday contacts, the city could reopen in-person schools, provided they increase physical distancing with 0.5 million (0.2–0.9) additional cases and hospitalizations peaking at 12,000 (3,700–27,000) on January 19, 2021 (60% chance of exceedance). Conclusion. MCMA must increase COVID-19 hospital capacity under all scenarios considered. MCMA’s ability to reopen schools in early 2021 depends on sustaining physical distancing and on controlling contacts during the end-of-year holiday.","Alarid-Escudero, Fernando; Gracia, Valeria; Luviano, Andrea; Roa, Jorge; Peralta, Yadira; Reitsma, Marissa B.; Claypool, Anneke L.; Salomon, Joshua A.; Studdert, David M.; Andrews, Jason R.; Goldhaber-Fiebert, Jeremy D.",MDM Policy Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8512280/,244

However, application of the LESS technique in portal hypertension is still in its infancy. We report in this article a new technique of LESS splenectomy plus pericardial devascularization with conventional laparoscopic instruments in patients with portal hypertension. PATIENTS AND METHODS From January 2010 to April 2012, LESS splenectomy plus pericardial devascularization was performed on 5 patients with portal hypertension. Surgical techniques and short-term outcomes were summarized and analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS All the operations were successful with a mean operative duration of 252 minutes (range, 220-270 minutes), intraoperative blood loss of 290 mL (range, 250-350 mL), and hospital stay of 8.2 days (range, 7-9 days). No intraoperative or postoperative complications were recorded. The umbilical incision healed well with a satisfactory cosmetic effect.

The psychosocial interactive model of resilience theorises that resilience might be 'switched on' in order to support and/or maintain smoking cessation for these populations. This study aimed to develop a Resilience Intervention for Smoking Cessation (RISC) through reviewing the extant literature around efficacious interventions for smoking cessation. Deliberative democracy principles were then used to understand lay perspectives regarding this potential smoking cessation program. METHODS Public health databases were searched to find efficacious psycho-social resilience interventions in the peer-reviewed literature for smoking cessation amongst lower SES populations. Potential components for RISC were selected based on evidence within the literature for their effectiveness. We then employed the Nominal Group Technique (NGT) to create discussion and consensus on the most socially appropriate and feasible components from the perspective of smokers from low SES areas. The NGT included 16 people from a lower SES population in southern metropolitan Adelaide who indicated they were seriously contemplating quitting smoking or had recently quit. Data were collected from multiple Likert ratings and rankings of the interventions during the NGT workshop and analysed descriptively. The Wilcoxon signed-ranked test was used where appropriate. Qualitative data were collected from participant reflections and group discussion, and analysed thematically. RESULTS Six smoking cessation interventions, likely to enhance resilience, were selected as potential constituents for RISC: mindfulness training; setting realistic goals; support groups; smoke free environments; mobile phone apps; and motivational interviewing. Consensus indicated that mindfulness training and setting realistic goals were the most acceptable resilience enhancing interventions, based on perceived usefulness and feasibility. CONCLUSIONS This research applied principles from deliberative democracy in order to illuminate lay knowledge regarding an appropriate and acceptable smoking cessation resilience program for a lower SES population. This process of collaborative and complex knowledge-generation is critically important to confront inequities as an ongoing challenge in public health, such as smoking cessation for disadvantaged groups. Further research should involve development and trial of this resilience program.","Tsourtos, George; Foley, Kristen; Ward, Paul; Miller, Emma; Wilson, Carlene; Barton, Christopher; Lawn, Sharon",BMC public health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-019-7939-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31775709/,244
60998,Interventional approaches to deep vein thrombosis.,2012,"Introduction In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the restriction of students participating in face-to-face instruction, two medical students rapidly adapted a preclinical curriculum that virtually teaches improvement science and equips learners with the knowledge to address patient needs. Methods Eight first-year medical students participating in a longitudinal patient navigation and health systems science program completed 15 interactive video sessions. After learning about the Model for Improvement and various quality improvement tools, students worked in teams of four to conduct several plan-do-study-act cycles. Postsession surveys captured student satisfaction, session feedback, and reflections about conducting improvement work. Two medical students then applied conventional content analysis to identify themes to describe the data. Results Student projects focused on addressing patients' health care and social resource needs through telephone and electronic interactions. Five themes were identified in the survey results: (1) learning by doing in the dynamic nature of improvement work; (2) enjoyment of virtual team-based learning; (3) project relevance to COVID-19; (4) utility of quality improvement tools; and (5) continuous curriculum improvement with student feedback. Conclusions In this student-led endeavor, we implemented a virtual improvement curriculum where first-year medical students apply improvement science knowledge to patient needs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results demonstrate the feasibility of teaching improvement in a virtual setting where learning is action-based with project work being relevant to health care priorities.

To date, the pandemic situation in all 55 African Union (AU) Member States has not been comprehensively reviewed. We aimed to evaluate reported COVID-19 epidemiology data to better understand the pandemic's progression in Africa. METHODS We did a cross-sectional analysis between Feb 14 and Dec 31, 2020, using COVID-19 epidemiological, testing, and mitigation strategy data reported by AU Member States to assess trends and identify the response and mitigation efforts at the country, regional, and continent levels. We did descriptive analyses on the variables of interest including cumulative and weekly incidence rates, case fatality ratios (CFRs), tests per case ratios, growth rates, and public health and social measures in place. FINDINGS As of Dec 31, 2020, African countries had reported 2 763 421 COVID-19 cases and 65 602 deaths, accounting for 3·4% of the 82 312 150 cases and 3·6% of the 1 798 994 deaths reported globally. Nine of the 55 countries accounted for more than 82·6% (2 283 613) of reported cases. 18 countries reported CFRs greater than the global CFR (2·2%). 17 countries reported test per case ratios less than the recommended ten to 30 tests per case ratio range. At the peak of the first wave in Africa in July, 2020, the mean daily number of new cases was 18 273. As of Dec 31, 2020, 40 (73%) countries had experienced or were experiencing their second wave of cases with the continent reporting a mean of 23 790 daily new cases for epidemiological week 53. 48 (96%) of 50 Member States had five or more stringent public health and social measures in place by April 15, 2020, but this number had decreased to 36 (72%) as of Dec 31, 2020, despite an increase in cases in the preceding month. INTERPRETATION Our analysis showed that the African continent had a more severe second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic than the first, and highlights the importance of examining multiple epidemiological variables down to the regional and country levels over time. These country-specific and regional results informed the implementation of continent-wide initiatives and supported equitable distribution of supplies and technical assistance. Monitoring and analysis of these data over time are essential for continued situational awareness, especially as Member States attempt to balance controlling COVID-19 transmission with ensuring stable economies and livelihoods.

Technologies have evolved from very invasive to non-invasive, and the philosophy has shifted from a static approach to a functional approach. However, despite these major changes, the critical care community still has potential to improve its ability to adopt the most modern standards of research methodology in order to more effectively evaluate new monitoring systems and their impact on patient outcome. Today, despite the huge enthusiasm raised by new hemodynamic monitoring systems, there is still a big gap between clinical research studies evaluating these monitors and clinical practice. A few studies, especially in the perioperative period, have shown that hemodynamic monitoring systems coupled with treatment protocols can improve patient outcome. These trials are small and, overall, the corpus of science related to this topic does not yet fit the standard of clinical research methodology encountered in other specialties such as cardiology and oncology. Larger randomized trials or quality improvement processes will probably answer questions related to the real impact of these systems.","Ramsingh, Davinder; Alexander, Brenton; Cannesson, Maxime",Critical care,https://doi.org/10.1186/cc11814; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23672729/,244

The average size of Ag nanoparticles is shown to be increased with decreasing of the activity of reducing agent (E0) and equals to 3.8 nm, 4.3 nm, and 15.8 nm, respectively, when engaging sodium borohydride (-1.24 V), hydrazine (-1.15 V) and ascorbic acid (-0.35 V). Moreover, it was found that the crystallite size of Ag nanoparticles also had the smallest value for nanocomposites obtained involving NaBH4 as reducing agent. Ag-containing nanocomposites prepared by reduction of silver ions in interpolyelectrolyte-metal complexes while applying a range of reducing agents are characterized by different electrical properties and polymer matrix' glass transition temperature. The influence of silver nanoparticles' size incorporated in the polymer matrix on the antimicrobial activity of nanocomposites has been established. The inhibition zone diameter of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli was higher for nanocomposites obtained using sodium borohydride and hydrazine compared to nanocomposites where ascorbic acid was used as the reducing agent.","Demchenko, V; Riabov, S; Kobylinskyi, S; Goncharenko, L; Rybalchenko, N; Kruk, A; Moskalenko, O; Shut, M",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-64079-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346019/,244
62673,Successful use of plasma exchange for profound hemolysis in a child with loxoscelism.,2014,"BACKGROUND Acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) account for one-quarter of cases of acute respiratory failure in intensive care units (ICUs). A third to half of patients will die in the ICU, in hospital or during follow-up. Mechanical ventilation of people with ALI/ARDS allows time for the lungs to heal, but ventilation is invasive and can result in lung injury. It is uncertain whether ventilator-related injury would be reduced if pressure delivered by the ventilator with each breath is controlled, or whether the volume of air delivered by each breath is limited. OBJECTIVES To compare pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) versus volume-controlled ventilation (VCV) in adults with ALI/ARDS to determine whether PCV reduces in-hospital mortality and morbidity in intubated and ventilated adults. SEARCH METHODS In October 2014, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2014, Isssue 9), MEDLINE (1950 to 1 October 2014), EMBASE (1980 to 1 October 2014), the Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (1994 to 1 October 2014) and Science Citation Index-Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED) at the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science (1990 to 1 October 2014), as well as regional databases, clinical trials registries, conference proceedings and reference lists. SELECTION CRITERIA Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs (irrespective of language or publication status) of adults with a diagnosis of acute respiratory failure or acute on chronic respiratory failure and fulfilling the criteria for ALI/ARDS as defined by the American-European Consensus Conference who were admitted to an ICU for invasive mechanical ventilation, comparing pressure-controlled or pressure-controlled inverse-ratio ventilation, or an equivalent pressure-controlled mode (PCV), versus volume-controlled ventilation, or an equivalent volume-controlled mode (VCV). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently screened and selected trials, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We sought clarification from trial authors when needed. We pooled risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous data and mean differences (MDs) for continuous data with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a random-effects model. We assessed overall evidence quality using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. MAIN RESULTS We included three RCTs that randomly assigned a total of 1089 participants recruited from 43 ICUs in Australia, Canada, Saudi Arabia, Spain and the USA. Risk of bias of the included studies was low. Only data for mortality and barotrauma could be combined in the meta-analysis. We downgraded the quality of evidence for the three mortality outcomes on the basis of serious imprecision around the effect estimates. For mortality in hospital, the RR with PCV compared with VCV was 0.83 (95% CI 0.67 to 1.02; three trials, 1089 participants; moderate-quality evidence), and for mortality in the ICU, the RR with PCV compared with VCV was 0.84 (95% CI 0.71 to 0.99; two trials, 1062 participants; moderate-quality evidence). One study provided no evidence of clear benefit with the ventilatory mode for mortality at 28 days (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.06; 983 participants; moderate-quality evidence). The difference in effect on barotrauma between PCV and VCV was uncertain as the result of imprecision and different co-interventions used in the studies (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.77; two trials, 1062 participants; low-quality evidence). Data from one trial with 983 participants for the mean duration of ventilation, and from another trial with 78 participants for the mean number of extrapulmonary organ failures that developed with PCV or VCV, were skewed. None of the trials reported on infection during ventilation or quality of life after discharge. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Currently available data from RCTs are insufficient to confirm or refute whether pressure-controlled or volume-controlled ventilation offers any advantage for people with acute respiratory failure due to acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome. More studies including a larger number of people given PCV and VCV may provide reliable evidence on which more firm conclusions can be based.","Chacko, Binila; Peter, John V; Tharyan, Prathap; John, George; Jeyaseelan, Lakshmanan",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd008807.pub2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25586462/,244
63424,Retrieval of ruptured valves and their accessories during transcatheter aortic valve replacement.,2014,"Recently, we described B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) subtype with early switch to the monocytic lineage and loss of the B-cell immunophenotype, including CD19 expression. Thus far, the genetic background has remained unknown. Among 726 children consecutively diagnosed with BCP-ALL, 8% patients experienced switch detectable by flow cytometry (FC). Using exome and RNA sequencing, switch was found to positively correlate with three different genetic subtypes: PAX5-P80R mutation (5 cases with switch out of 5), rearranged DUX4 (DUX4r; 30 cases of 41) and rearranged ZNF384 (ZNF384r; 4 cases of 10). Expression profiles or phenotypic patterns correlated with genotypes, but within each genotype they could not identify cases who subsequently switched. If switching was not taken into account, the B-cell-oriented FC assessment underestimated the minimal residual disease level. For patients with PAX5-P80R, a discordance between FC-determined and PCR-determined MRD was found on day 15, resulting from a rapid loss of the B-cell phenotype. Discordance on day 33 was observed in all the DUX4r, PAX5-P80R and ZNF384r subtypes. Importantly, despite the substantial phenotypic changes, possibly even challenging the appropriateness of BCP-ALL therapy, the monocytic switch was not associated with a higher incidence of relapse and poorer prognosis in patients undergoing standard ALL treatment.","Novakova, Michaela; Zaliova, Marketa; Fiser, Karel; Vakrmanova, Barbora; Slamova, Lucie; Musilova, Alena; Brüggemann, Monika; Ritgen, Matthias; Fronkova, Eva; Kalina, Tomas; Stary, Jan; Winkowska, Lucie; Svec, Peter; Kolenova, Alexandra; Stuchly, Jan; Zuna, Jan; Trka, Jan; Hrusak, Ondrej; Mejstrikova, Ester",Haematologica,https://doi.org/10.3324/haematol.2020.250423; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32646889/,244

However, the crisis also simultaneously increased stress on families while decreasing their desire to hospitalize youth for a nonmedical issue. Hence, the need for a PHP remained high. Health care organizations worked diligently to create a secure telehealth platform (tele-PHP) to be delivered to patients in their home environments. This article describes the development and implementation of child and adolescent tele-PHPs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These new programs were started in mid-March 2020, and changes were implemented over the next 3 to 4 weeks. Overall, patients and families have been receptive to behavioral health services delivered through telemedicine. While tele-PHPs are the most plausible solution to continue behavioral health care for these patients, some challenges were observed during this process. Besides procedural and technological challenges associated with creating a virtual setup, other difficulties include variable patient engagement, specific treatment-related challenges, and system-related changes. These challenges are addressed through psychoeducation, provision of online measures to assess treatment outcomes, and efforts to optimize parent engagement prior to treatment initiation for better treatment adherence. Initial experiences during a time of crisis suggest that tele-PHP services can be a viable long-term treatment option in the future during both a disaster and routine times to improve access for those who otherwise cannot take advantage of such services. Long-term effectiveness of these interventions still needs to be explored.","Baweja, Raman; Verma, Shikha; Pathak, Meenal; Waxmonsky, James G",The primary care companion for CNS disorders,https://doi.org/10.4088/pcc.20m02743; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33063479/,244

The Shannon entropy is maximized near the EP in the parameter space for two interacting modes, but the exact maximum position is slightly off the EP toward the weak interaction region while the slopes of the Shannon entropies diverge at the EP. The Shannon entropies also show discontinuity across a specific line in the parameter space, directly related to the exchange of the Shannon entropy as well as the mode patterns with that line as a boundary. This feature results in a nontrivial topological structure of the Shannon entropy surfaces.","Park, Kyu-Won; Kim, Jinuk; Moon, Songky; An, Kyungwon",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-69479-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32724215/,244

68867,Use of cerebral oxygen saturation and hemoglobin concentration to predict acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery.,2018,"We developed a novel approach to perform a perfect 11p lymph node dissection (LND), the so-called 'midpancreas mobilization' (MPM) method. Briefly, in pure single-incision laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (SIDG), after the completion of 7, 8a/12a, and 9 LND in the suprapancreatic portion, we started 11p LND after midpancreas mobilization. After mobilization of the entire midpancreas from the white line of Toldt, two gauzes were inserted behind the pancreas. This maneuver facilitated exposure of the splenic vein and complete detachment of soft tissue, including 11p lymph nodes, from the white line of Toldt, which was possible because of the tilting of the pancreas. The dissection plane along the splenic artery and vein for 11p LND could be visualized just through control of the operator's grasper without the need of an assistant. Fourteen patients underwent the procedure without intraoperative events, conversion to conventional laparoscopy, or surgery-related complications, including postoperative pancreatic fistula. All patients underwent D2 LND by exposure of the splenic vein. The mean numbers of retrieved lymph node and 11p lymph node were 61.3 ± 9.0 (range, 49-70), and 4.00 ± 3.38 (range, 1-10). Thus, we concluded that MPM for 11p LND in pure SIDG appears feasible and embryologically ideal; this method can be used in conventional laparoscopic gastrectomy.","Ahn, Sang-Hoon; Jung, Do Hyun; Son, Sang-Yong; Park, Do Joong; Kim, Hyung-Ho",Annals of surgical treatment and research,https://doi.org/10.4174/astr.2014.87.5.279; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25368856/,244

In addition to established antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) measures, it is important to recognise the need for a paediatric focus to manage the physiological and pathological differences unique to children. Most studies on paediatric AMS are drawn from resource-rich, hospital settings. They support interventions including AMS programmes, bundled groups of interventions, guidelines and education initiatives. These must be tailored to specific institutions, populations and resources as translating interventions between these may not be effective. There are knowledge gaps in paediatric AMS, which pose challenges to designing both interventions and research in this area. These include quantifying antimicrobial consumption, defining AMS outcomes and understanding the development of AMR. Finding answers to fill these gaps needs urgent attention. There is also a need to think outside the box to improve AMS in children. Potential opportunities include intravenous antibiotics at home via hospital-in-the-home programmes, earlier switching to oral antibiotics, repurposing old antibiotics and re-evaluating children labelled as having antibiotic allergy. Using all of the possibilities available gives us the best chance of staying ahead of the relentless march of AMR in children.","Fay, Michael-John; Bryant, Penelope A",Journal of paediatrics and child health,https://doi.org/10.1111/jpc.15209; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33099822/,244

The argument is illustrated by an analysis of a case of systemic change in chronic disease management occurred in the Italian region of Lombardy over 2016-2017, when a radically novel governance of chronic disease for the 10 million population was put in place (a health care system that was later tested to its limits by the COVID-19 pandemic outburst which reached dramatic intensity in this region). This represented a major change in a key area of social and health policy. We claim that such change processes may be studied by means of the conceptual tools of social mechanisms.

The scale consists of 10 items and is a brief clinician rating scale for the detection of anxiety disorder in older people, particularly, in the presence of depression. METHODS The study was performed in two rural primary care settings in Crete. The sample consisted of 99 older (76 +/- 6.3 years old) people, who fulfilled the participating criteria. The translation and cultural adaptation of the questionnaire was performed according to international standards. Internal consistency using the Cronbach alpha coefficient and test-retest reliability using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to assess the reliability of the tool. An exploratory factor analysis using Varimax with Kaiser normalisation (rotation method) was used to examine the structure of the instrument, and for the correlation of the items interitem correlation matrix was applied and assessed with Cronbach alpha. RESULTS Translation and backtranslation did not reveal any specific problems. The psychometric properties of the Greek version of the SAST scale in primary care were good. Internal consistency of the instrument was good, the Cronbach alpha was found to be 0.763 (P <0.001) and ICC (95% CI) for reproducibility was found to be 0.763 (0.686 to 0.827). Factor analysis revealed three factors with eigenvalues >1.0 accounting for 60% of variance, while the Cronbach alpha was >0.7 for every item. CONCLUSIONS The Greek translation of the SAST questionnaire is comparable with that of the original version in terms of reliability, and can be used in primary healthcare research. Its use in clinical practice should be primarily as a screening tool only at this stage, with a follow-up consisting of a detailed interview with the patient, in order to confirm the diagnosis.","Grammatikopoulos, Ilias A; Sinoff, Gary; Alegakis, Athanasios; Kounalakis, Dimitrios; Antonopoulou, Maria; Lionis, Christos",Annals of general psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1186/1744-859x-9-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20051118/,244

71718,From 'Do No Harm' to 'Do Maximal Good': an evolving concept.,2020-05-08,"Background: An ongoing longitudinal study in six European sites includes a 3-monthly assessment of forced vital capacity (FVC), slow vital capacity (SVC), peak cough flow (PCF), and Sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (SNIP). The aim of this interim analysis was to assess the potential for SNIP to be a surrogate for aerosol generating procedures given COVID-19 related restrictions. Methods: This was a prospective observational study. Patients attending six study sites with King's Stage 2 or 3 ALS completed baseline FVC/SVC/SNIP/PCF and repeated assessments 3 monthly. Data were collected from March 2018 to March 2020, after which a COVID-19 related study suspension was imposed. Correlations between the measures were calculated. A Bayesian multiple outcomes random-effects model was constructed to investigate rates of decline across measures. Results: In total, 270 cases and 828 assessments were included (Mean age 65.2 ± 15.4 years; 32.6% Female; 60% Kings stage 2; 81.1% spinal onset). FVC and SVC were the most closely correlated outcomes (0.95). SNIP showed the least correlation with other metrics 0.53 (FVC), 0.54 (SVC), 0.60 (PCF). All four measures significantly declined over time. SNIP in the bulbar onset group showed the fastest rate of decline. Discussion: SNIP was not well correlated with FVC and SVC, probably because it examines a different aspect of respiratory function. Respiratory measures declined over time, but differentially according to the site of onset. SNIP is not a surrogate for FVC and SVC, but is a complementary measure, declining linearly and differentiating spinal and bulbar onset patients.","Murray, Deirdre; Rooney, James; Al-Chalabi, Amar; Bunte, Tommy; Chiwera, Theresa; Choudhury, Mutahhara; Chio, Adriano; Fenton, Lauren; Fortune, Jennifer; Maidment, Lindsay; Manera, Umberto; Mcdermott, Chris; Meldrum, Dara; Meyjes, Myrte; Tattersall, Rachel; Torrieri, Maria Claudia; Van Damme, Philip; Vanderlinden, Elien; Wood, Claire; Van Den Berg, Leonard H; Hardiman, Orla",Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis & frontotemporal degeneration,https://doi.org/10.1080/21678421.2021.1908362; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34590504/,244

72253,Topographical distribution of perioperative cerebral infarction associated with transcatheter aortic valve implantation.,2018,"Deaths occurring among agitated or violent individuals subjected to physical restraint have been attributed to positional asphyxia. Restraint in the prone position has been shown to alter respiratory and cardiac physiology, although this is thought not to be to the degree that would cause asphyxia in a healthy, adult individual. This comprehensive review identifies and summarizes the current scientific literature on prone position and restraint, including experiments that assess physiology on individuals restrained in a prone position. Some of these experimental approaches have attempted to replicate situations in which prone restraint would be used. Overall, most findings revealed that individuals subjected to physical prone restraint experienced a decrease in ventilation and/or cardiac output (CO) in prone restraint. Metabolic acidosis is noted with increased physical activity, in restraint-associated cardiac arrest and simulated encounters. A decrease in ventilation and CO can significantly worsen acidosis and hemodynamics. Given these findings, deaths associated with prone physical restraint are not the direct result of asphyxia but are due to cardiac arrest secondary to metabolic acidosis compounded by inadequate ventilation and reduced CO. As such, the cause of death in these circumstances would be more aptly referred to as ""prone restraint cardiac arrest"" as opposed to ""restraint asphyxia"" or ""positional asphyxia.""","Steinberg, Alon","Medicine, science, and the law",https://doi.org/10.1177/0025802420988370; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33629624/,244

72616,Microvascular reactivity monitored with near-infrared spectroscopy is impaired after induction of anaesthesia in cardiac surgery patients: An observational study.,2017,"BACKGROUND The use of health information technology (HIT) to improve patient safety is widely advocated by governmental and safety agencies. Electronic-prescribing and smart-pump technology are examples of HIT medication error reduction strategies. The introduction of new errors on HIT implementation is, however, also recognised. To determine the impact of HIT interventions, clear medication error definitions are required. This study aims to achieve consensus on defining as medication errors a range of either technology-generated, or previously unaddressed infusion-related scenarios, common in the paediatric intensive care setting. METHODS This study was conducted in a 23-bed paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of an Irish tertiary paediatric hospital. A modified Delphi technique was employed: previously undefined medication-incidents were identified by retrospective review of voluntary incident reports and clinical pharmacist interventions; a multidisciplinary expert panel scored each incident using a 9-point Likert scale over a number of iterative rounds; levels of agreement were assessed to produce a list of medication errors. Differences in scoring between healthcare professionals were assessed. RESULTS Seventeen potential errors or 'scenarios' requiring consensus were identified, 13 of which related to technology recently implemented into the PICU. These were presented to a panel of 37 participants, comprising of doctors, nurses and pharmacists. Consensus was reached to define as errors all reported smart-pump scenarios (n = 6) and those pertaining to the pre-electronic process of prescribing weight-based paediatric infusions (n = 4). Of 7 electronic-prescribing scenarios, 4 were defined as errors, 2 were deemed not to be and consensus could not be achieved for the last. Some differences in scoring between healthcare professionals were found, but were only significant (p < 0.05) for two and three scenarios in consensus rounds 1 and 2 respectively. CONCLUSION The list of medication errors produced using the Delphi technique highlights the diversity of previously undefined medication errors in PICU. The increased complexity of electronic-prescribing processes is evident from the difficulty in achieving consensus on those scenarios. Reducing ambiguity in defining medication errors should assist future research on the impact of HIT medication safety initiatives in critical care. The increasing use of HIT and associated new errors will necessitate further similar studies.","Howlett, Moninne M; Cleary, Brian J; Breatnach, Cormac V",BMC medical informatics and decision making,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12911-018-0713-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30526623/,244
73368,Safety of Topical Non-steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs in Osteoarthritis: Outcomes of a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,2019,"BACKGROUND Postoperative sore throat (POST) is a common complaint after general anesthesia, especially following thyroidectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS We examined the effect of adjusting the endotracheal tube cuff pressure during thyroidectomy on the incidence of airway complications. Ninety patients scheduled for elective thyroidectomy were randomized into two groups: control (group A, n = 45) and experimental (group B, n = 45). All patients underwent total intravenous anesthesia with propofol and remifentanil. In group A, the cuff pressure was set to 25 cm H2O initially and then monitored continuously without adjustment during thyroidectomy. In group B, the cuff pressure was maintained at approximately 25 cm H2O throughout the operation. The incidences and the severity of POST, hoarseness, dysphagia, and cough were recorded at 2 and 24 h postoperatively. RESULTS Cuff pressures in group A changed significantly over time (P < 0.05) and were higher than those of group B during thyroidectomy (P < 0.05). The incidences of POST were lower in group B than in group A at 2 and 24 h postoperatively (P < 0.05), and there was a significant difference in the severity of POST at 2 h postoperatively between the two groups. There were no differences in the incidences of hoarseness, dysphagia, and cough between the two study groups (P > 0.05). Adjusting the endotracheal cuff pressure during thyroidectomy decreased the incidence and degree of POST. CONCLUSIONS Intraoperative monitoring and adjustment of the cuff pressure can reduce POST in patients undergoing thyroidectomy.","Ryu, Jung-Hee; Han, Sun-Sook; Do, Sang-Hwan; Lee, Jung-Min; Lee, Sang-Chul; Choi, Eun-Soo",World journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-013-1908-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23334802/,244

Emerging research shows these children face multiple health challenges. However, we found no review focused solely on the health of such internally displaced children. Thus, this review sought to examine what is known about their health and their health concerns. METHODS A scoping review of the literature was conducted. A total of 10 databases were searched in January 2019, yielding 6602 articles after duplicates were eliminated. Two research assistants independently selected articles that met inclusion criteria. A numerical summary and thematic analysis were conducted to facilitate data extraction and data analysis. RESULTS A total of 25 articles met the inclusion criteria, including 16 quantitative, 6 qualitative and 3 mixed methods studies. The findings reveal elevated mental health problems and infectious diseases in this population. Findings on the nutritional status of internally displaced children as a broad group are mixed, with some studies showing poorer nutritional status among the children in this group and others showing poorer nutritional health status among host society children. Internally displaced children also experience challenges with access to health services. Premigration factors (trauma) and postmigration factors (humanitarian assistance on displacement) all contribute to the health of internally displaced children. CONCLUSION Findings provide insight into the complex array of factors influencing the health of internally displaced children. More intervention studies are required to address the needs of this population.","Salami, Bukola; Iwuagwu, Stella; Amodu, Oluwakemi; Tulli, Mia; Ndikom, Chizoma; Gommaa, Hayat; Lavin, Tina; Kariwo, Michael",BMJ global health,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2020-002584; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32859650/,244

75166,Propofol versus sevoflurane anaesthesia: effect on cognitive decline and event-related potentials.,2018,"Importance Administration of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated pneumonia carries increased risk of corrected QT (QTc) prolongation and cardiac arrhythmias. Objective To characterize the risk and degree of QT prolongation in patients with COVID-19 in association with their use of hydroxychloroquine with or without concomitant azithromycin. Design, Setting, and Participants This was a cohort study performed at an academic tertiary care center in Boston, Massachusetts, of patients hospitalized with at least 1 positive COVID-19 nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction test result and clinical findings consistent with pneumonia who received at least 1 day of hydroxychloroquine from March 1, 2020, through April 7, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures Change in QT interval after receiving hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin; occurrence of other potential adverse drug events. Results Among 90 patients given hydroxychloroquine, 53 received concomitant azithromycin; 44 (48.9%) were female, and the mean (SD) body mass index was 31.5 (6.6). Hypertension (in 48 patients [53.3%]) and diabetes mellitus (in 26 patients [28.9%]) were the most common comorbid conditions. The overall median (interquartile range) baseline QTc was 455 (430-474) milliseconds (hydroxychloroquine, 473 [454-487] milliseconds vs hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, 442 [427-461] milliseconds; P < .001). Those receiving concomitant azithromycin had a greater median (interquartile range) change in QT interval (23 [10-40] milliseconds) compared with those receiving hydroxychloroquine alone (5.5 [-15.5 to 34.25] milliseconds; P = .03). Seven patients (19%) who received hydroxychloroquine monotherapy developed prolonged QTc of 500 milliseconds or more, and 3 patients (3%) had a change in QTc of 60 milliseconds or more. Of those who received concomitant azithromycin, 11 of 53 (21%) had prolonged QTc of 500 milliseconds or more and 7 of 53 (13 %) had a change in QTc of 60 milliseconds or more. The likelihood of prolonged QTc was greater in those who received concomitant loop diuretics (adjusted odds ratio, 3.38 [95% CI, 1.03-11.08]) or had a baseline QTc of 450 milliseconds or more (adjusted odds ratio, 7.11 [95% CI, 1.75-28.87]). Ten patients had hydroxychloroquine discontinued early because of potential adverse drug events, including intractable nausea, hypoglycemia, and 1 case of torsades de pointes. Conclusions and Relevance In this cohort study, patients who received hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of pneumonia associated with COVID-19 were at high risk of QTc prolongation, and concurrent treatment with azithromycin was associated with greater changes in QTc. Clinicians should carefully weigh risks and benefits if considering hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, with close monitoring of QTc and concomitant medication usage.","Mercuro, Nicholas J; Yen, Christina F; Shim, David J; Maher, Timothy R; McCoy, Christopher M; Zimetbaum, Peter J; Gold, Howard S",JAMA cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1834; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32356863/,244

The nanostructures are hydrophobic, highly uniform in width (4-5 nm) and variable in length (up to 1200 nm). Whereas the particle width is constrained by the size of the catanionic reverse micelles, changes in the reaction conditions such as the concentration of the surfactant salts and [Ce(AOT)]/[(CTA)PO] molar ratio, markedly influence the length of the inorganic nanostructures. The CePO nanofilaments are crystalline and morphologically invariant with regard to changes in the reaction conditions, whereas the Co(PO) nanorods are amorphous and more sensitive to modifications in the surfactant salt molar ratio. The results are consistent with a mechanism based on the slow uni-directional aggregation/crystallization of nanoscale surfactant-coated inorganic building blocks.","Xing, Yan; Li, Mei; Davis, Sean A; Patil, Avinash J; Mann, Stephen",Soft matter,https://doi.org/10.1039/b604831e; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680239/,244

76713,Radiologically Suspected Organizing Pneumonia in a Patient Recovering from COVID-19: A Case Report.,2021-02-26,"CONTEXT Recommendations have not been established concerning imaging to screen SDHx mutation carriers for paraganglioma and pheochromocytoma. OBJECTIVE Our objective was to compare the performance of gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography, contrast-enhanced computed tomography, and [(123)I]metaiodo-benzylguanidine and somatostatin receptor scintigraphies for detecting head and neck and thoracic-abdominal-pelvic paragangliomas in SDHx mutation carriers. DESIGN AND SETTING We conducted a prospective, multicenter study from June 2005 to December 2009 at 23 French medical centers. PATIENTS A total of 238 index cases or relatives carrying mutations in SDHD, SDHB, or SDHC genes were included. INTERVENTION Images obtained by each technique were analyzed blind, without knowledge of results from other tests, first in each local center and then centrally. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES We evaluated sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios for individual and combinations of tests, the gold standard being the consensus of an expert committee. RESULTS Two hundred two tumors were diagnosed in 96 subjects. At local assessment, the sensitivity of anatomical imaging for detecting all tumors was higher (85.7%) than that of both scintigraphic techniques (42.7% for [(123)I]metaiodo-benzylguanidine and 69.5% for somatostatin receptor scintigraphy), except for thoracic localizations where somatostatin receptor scintigraphy was more sensitive (61.5 vs. 46.2% for anatomical imaging and 30.8% for [(123)I]metaiodo-benzylguanidine scintigraphy). The best diagnostic performance during local assessment was obtained by combining anatomical imaging tests and somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (sensitivity 91.7%). Central assessment significantly increased the sensitivity (98.6%) of tests in combination. CONCLUSIONS In routine practice, the imaging work-up for screening SDHx mutation carriers should include thoraco-abdomino-pelvic computed tomography, head and neck magnetic angiography, and somatostatin receptor scintigraphy. Expert centralized image assessment is recommended.","Gimenez-Roqueplo, Anne-Paule; Caumont-Prim, Aurore; Houzard, Claire; Hignette, Chantal; Hernigou, Anne; Halimi, Philippe; Niccoli, Patricia; Leboulleux, Sophie; Amar, Laurence; Borson-Chazot, Françoise; Cardot-Bauters, Catherine; Delemer, Brigitte; Chabolle, Frédéric; Coupier, Isabelle; Libé, Rossella; Peitzsch, Mirko; Peyrard, Séverine; Tenenbaum, Florence; Plouin, Pierre-François; Chatellier, Gilles; Rohmer, Vincent",The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2012-2975; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23162105/,244

Methods Of 101 laparoscopic appendectomy with ERAS protocol cases for appendicitis from March 2019 to April 2020, 54 patients underwent SILA with multimodal analgesic approach (group 1) while 47 patients received CLA with multimodal analgesic approach (group 2). SILA and CLA were compared with the single institution's ERAS protocol. To adjust for baseline differences and selection bias, operative outcomes and complications were compared after propensity score matching (PSM). Results After 1:1 PSM, well-matched 35 patients in each group were evaluated. Postoperative hospital stays for patients in group 1 (1.2 ± 0.8 vs. 1.6 ± 0.8 days, P = 0.037) were significantly lesser than those for patients in group 2. However, opioid consumption (2.0 mg vs. 1.4 mg, P=0.1) and the postoperative scores of visual analogue scale for pain at 6 hours (2.4±1.9 vs. 2.8 ± 1.4, P = 0.260) and 12 hours (2.4 ± 2.0 vs. 2.9 ± 1.5, P = 0.257) did not show significant difference between the 2 groups. Conclusion SILA resulted in shortening the length of hospitalization without increase in complications or readmission rates compared to CLA with ERAS protocol.","Kim, Won Jong; Jin, Hyeong Yong; Lee, Hyojin; Bae, Jung Hoon; Koh, Wooree; Mun, Ji Yeon; Kim, Hee Ju; Lee, In Kyu; Lee, Yoon Suk; Lee, Chul Seung",Annals of coloproctology,https://doi.org/10.3393/ac.2020.09.15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34167189/,244
77611,Comparison of transcarotid versus transapical transcatheter aortic valve implantation outcomes in patients with severe aortic stenosis and contraindications for transfemoral access.,2021-07-26,"BACKGROUND Theory-guided approaches to implementation science have informed translation efforts and the acceptance of eHealth (digital health) interventions in clinical care. However, there is scarce evidence on which theories are best suited to addressing the inherent complexity of eHealth implementation. OBJECTIVE The objectives of this systematic review are to identify theories that inform and explain eHealth implementation and to classify these theories using the typology by Sovacool and Hess for theories of sociotechnical change. METHODS An electronic search was conducted in the PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus, Sociological Source Ultimate, Web of Science, ABI/INFORM, EBSCO, and ProQuest databases in June 2019. Studies were included if they were published between 2009 and June 2019; were written in English; reported on empirical research, regardless of study or publication type; reported on one or more theories in the context of eHealth implementation; and were published in a peer-reviewed journal. A total of 2 reviewers independently assessed the titles, abstracts, and full texts. Theories identified were classified using a typology for theories of sociotechnical change, which was considered a useful tool for ordering and analyzing the diverse theoretical approaches as a basis for future theory building. RESULTS Of the 13,101 potentially relevant titles, 119 studies were included. The review identified 36 theories used to explain implementation approaches in eHealth. The most commonly used approaches were the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) (n=33) and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) (n=32). These theories were primarily concerned with individual and interpersonal elements of eHealth acceptance. Less common were theories that reflect the various disorderly social processes and structural dimensions of implementation, such as the normalization process theory (n=17) and the structuration theory (n=6). CONCLUSIONS Theories currently informing the implementation of eHealth interventions predominantly focus on predicting or explaining end-user acceptance. Theoretical perspectives that capture the dense and intricate relationships and structures required to enact sustainable change are less well represented in the eHealth literature. Given the growing acknowledgment of the inherent complexity of eHealth implementation, future research should develop and test models that recognize and reflect the multidimensional, dynamic, and relational nature of this process.","Heinsch, Milena; Wyllie, Jessica; Carlson, Jamie; Wells, Hannah; Tickner, Campbell; Kay-Lambkin, Frances",Journal of medical Internet research,https://doi.org/10.2196/18500; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34057427/,244

Setting Fifteen multi-subspecialty ophthalmology practices and surgery centers located in 14 states (Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wisconsin). Design Prospective, multicenter, IRB approved study of patients treated with canaloplasty (360°) and trabeculotomy (180°). Eligible patients had cataract and mild-moderate OAG with intraocular pressure (IOP) ≤33 mmHg on 1 to 4 hypotensive medications. Methods Medication washout prior to baseline diurnal IOP (Goldmann). Effectiveness outcomes included mean IOP and medications. Safety outcomes included adverse events (AE), best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and secondary surgical interventions (SSI). Analysis includes descriptive statistics and t-tests evaluating change from baseline. Results A total of 137 patients were enrolled and treated. Mean diurnal IOP after washout was 23.8 ± 3.1 mmHg at baseline. At month 6, 78% (104/134) were medication free with IOP of 14.2 mmHg, a mean reduction of 9.0 mmHg (38%). 100% (104/104) had a ≥ 20% reduction in IOP and 86% (89/104) had IOP ≥6 and ≤18 mmHg. The mean number of medications at screening was 1.8 ± 0.9 and 0.6 ± 1.0 at month 6. AE included transient hyphema (4.6%) and IOP elevation ≥10 mmHg (2%). There were no AE for loss of BCVA or recurring hyphema. There were no SSI. Conclusion Canaloplasty followed with trabeculotomy and performed concomitantly with phacoemulsification has favorable intra and perioperative safety, significantly reduces IOP and anti-glaucoma medications through 6 months in eyes with mild-moderate OAG.","Gallardo, Mark J; Sarkisian, Steven R; Vold, Steven D; Singh, Inder Paul; Flowers, Brian E; Campbell, Anita; Dhamdhere, Kavita; Samuelson, Thomas W",Clinical ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.2147/opth.s296740; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33603325/,244

78202,Genomic and Phenotypic Analysis of COVID-19-Associated Pulmonary Aspergillosis Isolates of Aspergillus fumigatus.,2021-06-09,"Importance Decision-making in the timing of tracheostomy in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has centered on the intersection of long-standing debates on the benefits of early vs late tracheostomy, assumptions about timelines of infectivity of the novel coronavirus, and concern over risk to surgeons performing tracheostomy. Multiple consensus guidelines recommend avoiding or delaying tracheostomy, without evidence to indicate anticipated improvement in outcomes as a result. Objective To assess outcomes from early tracheostomy in the airway management of patients with COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation. Design, Setting, and Participants A retrospective medical record review was completed of 148 patients with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation at a single tertiary-care medical center in New York City from March 1 to May 7, 2020. Interventions Open or percutaneous tracheostomy. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcomes were time from symptom onset to (1) endotracheal intubation, (2) tracheostomy; time from endotracheal intubation to tracheostomy; time from tracheostomy to (1) tracheostomy tube downsizing, (2) decannulation; total time on mechanical ventilation; and total length of stay. Results Participants included 148 patients, 120 men and 28 women, with an overall mean (SD) age of 58.1 (15.8) years. Mean (SD; median) time from symptom onset to intubation was 10.57 (6.58; 9) days; from symptom onset to tracheostomy, 22.76 (8.84; 21) days; and from endotracheal intubation to tracheostomy, 12.23 (6.82; 12) days. The mean (SD; median) time to discontinuation of mechanical ventilation was 33.49 (18.82; 27) days; from tracheostomy to first downsize, 23.02 (13.76; 19) days; and from tracheostomy to decannulation, 30.16 (16.00; 26) days. The mean (SD; median) length of stay for all patients was 51.29 (23.66; 45) days. Timing of tracheostomy was significantly associated with length of stay: median length of stay was 40 days in those who underwent early tracheostomy (within 10 days of endotracheal intubation) and 49 days in those who underwent late tracheostomy (median difference, -8; 95% CI, -15 to -1). In a competing risks model with death as the competing risk, the late tracheostomy group was 16% less likely to discontinue mechanical ventilation (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.55 to 1.28). Conclusions and Relevance This cohort study from the first 2 months of the pandemic in New York City provides an opportunity to reconsider guidelines for tracheostomy for patients with COVID-19. Findings demonstrated noninferiority of early tracheostomy and challenges recommendations to categorically delay or avoid tracheostomy in this patient population. When aligned with emerging evidence about the timeline of infectivity of the novel coronavirus, this approach may optimize outcomes from tracheostomy while keeping clinicians safe.","Kwak, Paul E; Connors, Joseph R; Benedict, Peter A; Timen, Micah R; Wang, Binhuan; Zhang, Yan; Youlios, Stephanie; Sureau, Kimberly; Persky, Michael J; Rafeq, Samaan; Angel, Luis; Amin, Milan R",JAMA otolaryngology-- head & neck surgery,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoto.2020.4837; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33331855/,244

78946,First-in-human use of the OneShot™ renal denervation system from Covidien.,2013,"BACKGROUND AND AIM Symptomatic cervical heterotopic gastric mucosa, also known as cervical inlet patch (CIP), may present in various shapes and causes laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR). Unfortunately, argon plasma coagulation, standard treatment of small symptomatic CIP, is limited in large CIP mainly because of concerns of stricture formation. Therefore, we aimed to investigate radiofrequency ablation (RFA), a novel minimally invasive ablation method, in the treatment of CIP focusing on large symptomatic patches. METHODS Consecutive patients with macroscopic and histological evidence of large (≥20 mm diameter) heterotopic gastric mucosa were included in this prospective trial. Primary outcome was complete macroscopic and histological eradication rate of CIP. Secondary outcome measures were symptom improvement, quality of life, severity of LPR and adverse events. RESULTS Ten patients (females, n = 5) underwent RFA of symptomatic CIP. Complete histological and macroscopic eradication of CIP was observed in 80% (females, n = 4) of individuals after two ablations. Globus sensations significantly improved from median visual analog scale score 8 (5-9) at baseline to 1.5 (1-7) after first ablation and 1 (1-2) after final evaluation (P < 0.001). Mental health scores significantly increased from 41.4 (± 8.5) to 54.4 (± 4.4) after RFA (P = 0.007). LPR improved significantly (P = 0.005) with absence of strictures after a mean follow up of 1.9 (± 0.5) years. CONCLUSIONS This is the first study on RFA focusing on therapy of large symptomatic heterotopic gastric mucosa. Hereby, we demonstrate that this new technique can be successfully implemented in patients where treatment was limited so far (NCT03023280).","Kristo, Ivan; Rieder, Erwin; Paireder, Matthias; Schwameis, Katrin; Jomrich, Gerd; Dolak, Werner; Parzefall, Thomas; Riegler, Martin; Asari, Reza; Schoppmann, Sebastian F",Digestive endoscopy : official journal of the Japan Gastroenterological Endoscopy Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/den.12959; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28884487/,244
79286,Time for a new international evidence-based recommendations for point-of-care lung ultrasound.,2020-08-08,"Much attention has been paid to developing methods capable of synchronous removal of pollutants from swine wastewater. Due to the natural symbiotic interactions between microalgae and bacteria, the microalgae-bacteria symbiosis (ABS) system has been found to have potential for treating wastewater. However, the corresponding biological mechanisms in the ABS system and the role of dynamic microbial community evolution in pollutant removal systems remain poorly understood. Therefore, we investigate the potential of an ABS system for pollutant removal applications and analyze the bacterial consortium symbiotically combined with Chlorella sp. MA1 and Coelastrella sp. KE4. The NH4+-N and PO43--P removal efficiencies were significantly increased from 12.79% to 99.52% and 35.66% to 96.06% due to biotic interactions between the microalgae and bacteria. The abundance of bacterial taxa and genes related to oxidative stress, cell growth and nitrogen transfer were found to increase in response to photosynthesis, respiration and NH4+-N uptake. Furthermore, pathogen inactivation was induced via microalgae, co-driven by microbial succession under high dissolved oxygen conditions. In this microalgae-enhanced ABS system, the interactions between microalgae and bacteria are established for pathogens elimination and nitrogen cycling, verifying that the ABS system is an effective and environmentally sustainable swine wastewater treatment method.","Qu, Wenying; Zhang, Chaofan; Chen, Xi; Ho, Shih-Hsin",Journal of hazardous materials,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.126264; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34118545/,244

Studies of how dominance rank predicts these traits typically employ one of several dominance rank metrics without examining the assumptions each metric makes about its underlying competitive processes. Here, we compare the ability of two dominance rank metrics-simple ordinal rank and proportional or 'standardized' rank-to predict 20 traits in a wild baboon population in Amboseli, Kenya. We propose that simple ordinal rank best predicts traits when competition is density-dependent, whereas proportional rank best predicts traits when competition is density-independent. We found that for 75% of traits (15/20), one rank metric performed better than the other. Strikingly, all male traits were best predicted by simple ordinal rank, whereas female traits were evenly split between proportional and simple ordinal rank. Hence, male and female traits are shaped by different competitive processes: males are largely driven by density-dependent resource access (e.g. access to oestrous females), whereas females are shaped by both density-independent (e.g. distributed food resources) and density-dependent resource access. This method of comparing how different rank metrics predict traits can be used to distinguish between different competitive processes operating in animal societies.","Levy, Emily J; Zipple, Matthew N; McLean, Emily; Campos, Fernando A; Dasari, Mauna; Fogel, Arielle S; Franz, Mathias; Gesquiere, Laurence R; Gordon, Jacob B; Grieneisen, Laura; Habig, Bobby; Jansen, David J; Learn, Niki H; Weibel, Chelsea J; Altmann, Jeanne; Alberts, Susan C; Archie, Elizabeth A",Proceedings.

METHODS We searched PubMed and Embase for cohort and case-control studies reporting on ≥100 patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage, that specified the location of the hematoma and reported associations with risk factors published until June 27th 2019. Two authors independently extracted data on risk factors. Estimates were pooled with the generic variance-based random effects method. RESULTS After screening 10 013 articles, we included 42 studies totaling 26 174 patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (9 141 lobar and 17 033 non-lobar). Risk factors for non-lobar intracerebral hemorrhage were hypertension (risk ratio 4.25, 95% confidence interval 3.05-5.91, I2=92%), diabetes (RR 1.35, 1.11-1.64, I2=37% ), male sex (RR 1.63, 1.25-2.14, I2=61%), alcohol overuse (RR 1.48, 1.21-1.81, I2=19%), underweight (RR 2.12, 1.12-4.01, I2=31%), and being black (RR 2.19, 1.21-3.96, I2=96%) or Hispanic (RR 2.13,0.94-4.81, I2=71%) in comparison with being white. Hypertension, but not any of the other risk factors, was also a risk factor for lobar intracerebral hemorrhage (RR 1.83, 1.39-2.42, I2=76%). Smoking, hypercholesterolemia and obesity were associated with neither non-lobar nor lobar intracerebral hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS Hypertension is a risk factor for both non-lobar and lobar intracerebral hemorrhage, although with double the effect for non-lobar intracerebral hemorrhage. Diabetes, male sex, alcohol overuse, underweight, and being black or Hispanic are risk factors for non-lobar intracerebral hemorrhage only. Hence, the term ""hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage"" for non-lobar intracerebral hemorrhage is not appropriate.","Jolink, Wilmar M T; Wiegertjes, Kim; Rinkel, Gabriël J E; Algra, Ale; de Leeuw, Frank-Erik; Klijn, Catharina J M",Neurology,https://doi.org/10.1212/wnl.0000000000010418; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32690784/,244
81676,"Efficacy and safety of apremilast in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis of the scalp: results up to 32 weeks from a randomised, phase 3 study.",2021-03-24,"CONTEXT Morphine has been considered the gold standard for treating moderate-to-severe pain, although many new opioid products and formulations have been marketed in the last two decades and should be considered when examining opioid consumption. Understanding opioid consumption is improved by using an equianalgesic measure that controls for the strengths of all examined opioids. OBJECTIVES The research objective was to use a morphine equivalence (ME) metric to determine the extent that morphine consumption relates to the total consumption of all other study opioids. METHODS An ME metric was created for morphine and the aggregate consumption of each study opioid (Total ME), adjusted for country population to allow for uniform equianalgesic comparisons. Graphical and statistical evaluations of morphine use and Total ME consumption trends (between 1980 and 2009) were made for the global and geographic regional levels and selected developed and developing countries. RESULTS Global morphine consumption rose dramatically in the early 1980s but has been significantly outpaced by Total ME since 1996. As expected, the extent of morphine and Total ME consumption varied notably among regions, with the Americas, Europe, and Oceania regions accounting for the highest morphine use and Total ME in 2009. Developing and least developed countries, compared with developed countries, demonstrated lower overall Total ME consumption. CONCLUSION Generally, worldwide morphine use has not increased at the rate of Total ME, especially in recent years. Examining a country's ability to effectively manage moderate-to-severe pain should extend beyond morphine to account for all available potent opioids.","Gilson, Aaron M; Maurer, Martha A; Ryan, Karen M; Rathouz, Paul J; Cleary, James F",Journal of pain and symptom management,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2012.03.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23017614/,244
82365,Reinfection of COVID-19 after 3 months with a distinct and more aggressive clinical presentation: case report.,2020-10-28,"INTRODUCTION Robotic-assisted surgery is playing an increasingly important role in the last few years in the treatment of colorectal oncological disease. However, there are still no studies that objectively demonstrate the advantages of this type of surgery. We present a prospective randomised study in order to compare the short-term results between colorectal robotic surgery and laparoscopic surgery. MATERIAL AND METHOD A total of 56 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer between January 2008 and January 2009, were randomised and assigned to the robotic or laparoscopic group. Age, body mass index, tumour location, conversions in each group, complications during and after surgery, and histological characteristics of the specimens obtained, were all compared. RESULTS There were no significant differences between age (P=.055), body mass index (P=.12), or tumour location (P=.91). Only one patient in the robotic group required a transfusion and none in the laparoscopic group. The percentage of conversions was the same in both groups, however, the preparation times and operating times were significantly longer in patients intervened using the robotic device (P=.0001 and P=.017, respectively). There were no differences as regards the rate of complications or in the percentage of re-interventions (14.2% and 7.1%). The mean hospital stay of the patients was 9.3 (8.1) days in the robotic group and 9.2 (6.8) days in the laparoscopic (P=.79). The distal resection margin was greater in the specimen obtained using robotic surgery (P =.003) as well as the number of lymph nodes obtained in the specimen (P =.23). CONCLUSION Robotic colorectal was performed safely and effectively, and with similar clinical results. International Trial Number for this study is: ISRCTN60866560.","Jiménez Rodríguez, Rosa M; Díaz Pavón, José M; de La Portilla de Juan, Fernando; Prendes Sillero, Emilio; Hisnard Cadet Dussort, Jean Marie; Padillo, Javier",Cirugia espanola,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ciresp.2011.01.017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21530948/,244

However, the impact of different HRV types and viral load on disease severity has not been thoroughly elucidated. METHODS From January 2012 to September 2014, 1742 nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens from hospitalized children with lower respiratory tract infections were analyzed by quantitative HRV-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS Among these 1742 children, HRV (407/1742, 23%) was the second most common viral agent after respiratory syncytial virus. HRV-A, HRV-B, HRV-C and HRV untyped were detected in 229 (56%), 27 (7%), 100 (25%) and 51 (13%) specimens, respectively. Children except who experienced wheezing were more common in the HRV-C detection group than in the HRV-A detection group; there were no other significant differences between the 2 groups, including the percent of children diagnosed with severe diseases. Logistic regression models demonstrated that there was no difference in disease severity among HRV types. In HRV-A detection group, in children younger than 2 years, the viral load was higher in the severe group than in the nonsevere group; but in the HRV-C detection group, there was no difference. CONCLUSIONS HRV was frequently present in hospitalized children with lower respiratory tract infections in Chongqing, China. The disease severity for HRV-C and HRV-A was similar. A high load of HRV-A in the lower respiratory tract might be connected with disease severity in children younger than 2 years.","Xiao, Qiuyan; Zheng, Shouyan; Zhou, Lili; Ren, Luo; Xie, Xiaohong; Deng, Yu; Tian, Daiyin; Zhao, Yao; Fu, Zhou; Li, Tingyu; Huang, Ailong; Liu, Enmei",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0000000000000879; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26267309/,244

84458,Correction to: Study of Cellular Aging in a Cohort of Patients with Heart Failure.,2021-05-11,"Chlamydia trachomatis, a leading infectious cause of tubal infertility, induces upper genital tract pathology such as hydrosalpinx, which can be modeled with Chlamydia muridarum infection in mice. Following C. muridarum inoculation, wild type mice develop robust hydrosalpinx but OT1 mice fail to do so because their T cell receptors are engineered to recognize a single ovalbumin epitope (OVA457-462). These observations have demonstrated a critical role of Chlamydia-specific T cells in chlamydial pathogenicity. In the current study, we have also found that OT1 mice can actively inhibit chlamydial pathogenicity. First, depletion of CD8+ T cells from OT1 mice led to the induction of significant hydrosalpinx by Chlamydia, indicating that CD8+ T cells are necessary to inhibit chlamydial pathogenicity. Second, adoptive transfer of CD8+ T cells from OT1 mice to CD8 knockout mice significantly reduced chlamydial induction of hydrosalpinx, demonstrating that OT1 CD8+ T cells are sufficient for attenuating chlamydial pathogenicity in CD8 knockout mice. Finally, CD8+ T cells from OT1 mice also significantly inhibited hydrosalpinx development in wild type mice following an intravaginal inoculation with Chlamydia Since T cells in OT1 mice are engineered to recognize OVA457-462 epitope only, the above observations have demonstrated a chlamydial antigen-independent immune mechanism for regulating chlamydial pathogenicity. Further characterization of this mechanism may provide information for developing strategies to reduce infertility-causing pathology induced by infections.","Xie, Lingxiang; He, Conghui; Chen, Jianlin; Tang, Lingli; Zhou, Zhiguang; Zhong, Guangming",Infection and immunity,https://doi.org/10.1128/iai.00315-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32747602/,244

Given the rapidly evolving global response to SARS-CoV-2, here we primarily review the leading COVID-19 vaccine strategies that are currently in Phase III clinical trials. Non-replicating viral vector strategies, inactivated virus, recombinant protein subunit vaccines, and nucleic acid vaccine platforms are all being pursued in an effort to combat the infection. Preclinical and clinal trial results of these efforts are examined as well as the characteristics of each vaccine strategy from the humoral and cellular immune responses they stimulate, effects of any adjuvants used, and the potential risks associated with immunization such as antibody dependent enhancement (ADE). A number of promising advancements have been made toward the development of multiple vaccine candidates. Preliminary data now emerging from phase III clinical trials show encouraging results for the protective efficacy and safety of at least three frontrunning candidates.

In many cases of complete resection, pneumonectomy is performed. We herein report two techniques in which complete resection with negative margins at the intrapericardial pulmonary vein and left atrium was achieved without pneumonectomy. In the first technique, the groove of the pericardium between the right and left atrium was dissected and an atrial cuff was made in a manner that elongated the intrapericardial pulmonary vein. In the second technique, traction was applied to the atrial cuff, and only the middle lobe vein of the elongated pulmonary vein was resected, to perform atrial cuff plasty. The upper lobe vein and inferior pulmonary vein could be preserved. These techniques of PV elongation and atrial cuff plasty are suitable for both achieving complete resection and lung preservation for lung cancer patients with invasion of the left atrium.","Kuroda, Koji; Mori, Masataka; Shinohara, Syuichi; Oyama, Rintaro; Matsumiya, Hiroki; Kanayama, Masatoshi; Taira, Akihiro; Shinohara, Shinji; Kuwata, Taiji; Tanaka, Fumihiro",Surgery today,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00595-020-02089-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32885348/,244

Aims The aim of the study is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of this approach. Settings and Design This was a retrospective study. Subjects and Methods From 2007 to 2014, patients undergoing LLLS were identified from two institutions. Statistical Analysis Used Continuous variables were compared between groups with Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney test, as appropriate by type of distribution. Categorical variables were compared with Chi-square or Fisher's exact test, depending on the number of observations. Results Thirty-eight patients were included in the study. The mean age was 63.5 + 13 years (range, 31-89), and the mean number of tumours was 1.7 + 1.5. Eleven (29%) patients underwent LLS combined with an additional liver resection (combined resections group). The mean duration of the operation and the mean estimated blood loss were significantly decreased in the LLS group compared to the combined resection group (101 + 71 min vs. 208 + 98 min and 216 + 217 ml vs. 450 + 223 ml; P < 0.05 for both, respectively). The major complications rate was 8% and no mortality occurred. Conclusions In a subset of carefully selected cases, LLLS may provide the benefits of laparoscopy. This does not appear to compromise perioperative morbidity rates. We believe that this approach may serve as a training platform for surgical trainees.","Sadot, Eran; Goldberg, Natalia; Damoni, Emil; Aranovich, David; Kashtan, Hanoch; Bitterman, Arie; Haddad, Riad",Journal of minimal access surgery,https://doi.org/10.4103/jmas.jmas_148_18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30106024/,244
86090,Normal sleep on mechanical ventilation in adult patients with congenital central alveolar hypoventilation (Ondine's curse syndrome).,2017,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is characterized by insulin resistance and elevated blood glucose levels. Treatment protocols generally include dietary restriction of sugar, as well as drugs aiming at a reduction of blood glucose, mainly by activating the insulin system or supplementing insulin. This established approach does not take into account the outstanding physiological role of glucose as a key molecule in metabolism. Glucose is crucial to meet the high energy demand of the brain, which depends on it as an exclusive nutrient. Insulin independent glucose transporters GLUT1 import glucose into the brain. Reduction of blood glucose, as in current treatment concepts, may lead to energy deficiency in the brain and consecutively to worsening of - possibly already impaired - neurocognitive function. Reduced cell membrane fluidity of the vascular endothelium of the bloodbrain-barrier (BBB) - due to malnutrition and/or aging - is considered a major factor in pathogenesis of the cerebral metabolic syndrome, which is a key step in neurodegeneration. Under this aspect we suggest a novel approach to prophylaxis and treatment focusing on a sufficient supply of glucose to the brain.","Noe, C R; Handschuh, P; Wolfslehner, L; Noe, C A; Noe-Letschnig, M; Soucek-Noe, D; Lanzenberger, R",Die Pharmazie,https://doi.org/10.1691/ph.2020.0684; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33305717/,244
86570,Early hyperoxia burden detected by cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy is superior to pulse oximetry for prediction of severe retinopathy of prematurity.,2016,"BACKGROUND Sore throat is a common condition associated with a high rate of antibiotic prescriptions, despite limited evidence for the effectiveness of antibiotics. Corticosteroids may improve symptoms of sore throat by reducing inflammation of the upper respiratory tract. OBJECTIVES To assess the clinical benefit and safety of corticosteroids for symptoms of sore throat in adults and children. SEARCH METHODS We searched The Cochrane Library, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2012, Issue 5) which includes the Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) Group's Specialised Register, the Database of Reviews of Effects and the NHS Health Economics Database, MEDLINE (1966 to November Week 4, 2012) and EMBASE (1974 to June 2012). SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomised controlled trials that compared steroids to either placebo or standard care in adults and children (older than three years of age) with sore throat. We excluded studies of hospitalised participants, those with infectious mononucleosis, sore throat following tonsillectomy or intubation, or peritonsillar abscess. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently reviewed and selected trials from searches, assessed and rated study quality, and extracted relevant data. MAIN RESULTS We included eight trials involving 743 participants (369 children and 374 adults). All trials gave antibiotics to both placebo and corticosteroid groups; no trials assessed corticosteroids as standalone treatment for sore throat. In addition to any effect of antibiotics and analgesia, corticosteroids increased the likelihood of complete resolution of pain at 24 hours by more than three times (risk ratio (RR) 3.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.0 to 5.1, P < 0.001, I(2) statistic 44%) and at 48 hours by 1.7 times. Fewer than four people need to be treated to prevent one person continuing to experience pain at 24 hours. Corticosteroids also reduced the mean time to onset of pain relief and the mean time to complete resolution of pain by 6 and 14 hours, respectively, although significant heterogeneity was present. At 24 hours, pain (assessed by visual analogue scores) was reduced by an additional 14% by corticosteroids. No difference in rates of recurrence, relapse or adverse events were reported for participants taking corticosteroids compared to placebo, although reporting of adverse events was poor. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Oral or intramuscular corticosteroids, in addition to antibiotics, increase the likelihood of both resolution and improvement of pain in participants with sore throat. Further trials assessing corticosteroids in the absence of antibiotics and in children are warranted.","Hayward, Gail; Thompson, Matthew J; Perera, Rafael; Glasziou, Paul P; Del Mar, Chris B; Heneghan, Carl J",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd008268.pub2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23076943/,244
86585,Traditional Chinese Medicine Decoctions Significantly Reduce the Mortality in Severe and Critically Ill Patients with COVID-19: A Retrospective Cohort Study.,2021-06-05,"Background Much of Sub-Saharan Africa meets the rising rates of musculoskeletal injury with traditional bone setting, especially given limitations in access to allopathic orthopaedic care. Concern for the safety of bone setter practices as well as recognition of their advantages have spurred research to understand the impact of these healers on public health. Objectives Our study investigates the role of bone setting in Tanzania through patient utilization and perspectives. Methods We surveyed 212 patients at the outpatient orthopaedic clinic at Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre (KCMC) in Moshi, Tanzania. Surveys were either self-administered or physician-administered. Summary statistics were calculated using XLSTAT. Open responses were analyzed using a deductive framework method. Results Of all surveys, 6.3% (n=13) reported utilizing traditional bone setting for their injury prior to presenting to KCMC. Of the self-administered surveys, 13.6% (n=6) reported utilizing bone setting compared to 4.3% (n=7) of the physician-administered surveys (p=0.050). Negative perceptions of bone setting were more common than positive perceptions and the main reason patients did not utilize bone setting was concern for competency (35.8%, n=67). Conclusion Our study found lower bone setting utilization than expected considering the reliance of Tanzanians on traditional care reported in the literature. This suggests patients utilizing traditional care for musculoskeletal injury are not seeking allopathic care; therefore, collaboration with bone setters could expand allopathic access to these patients. Patients were less likely to report bone setter utilization to a physician revealing the stigma of seeking traditional care, which may present an obstacle for collaboration.","Card, Elizabeth B; Obayemi, Joy E; Shirima, Octavian; Rajaguru, Praveen; Massawe, Honest; Premkumar, Ajay; Sheth, Neil P",African health sciences,https://doi.org/10.4314/ahs.v21i1.52; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394324/,244

Objectives To determine the clinical and microbiological profile of patients admitted with CAP in Ilorin, Nigeria. Methods One hundred and two consenting consecutively selected patients with clinical and radiologic confirmation of CAP were recruited in 12 months. The socio-demographic, physical examination and laboratory/radiologic parameters were documented in a questionnaire. Microbiological evaluation of their sputum was done and blood samples were taken for complete blood count, culture, serum urea and serological evaluation for atypical bacteria and some viral pathogens. Results CAP constituted 5.9% of the total medical admissions during the one-year study period. The mean age of the patients was 49 ± 22 years with the largest frequency in those aged 65 years and above. The commonest symptoms were shortness of breath (96.1%) and cough (94.1%), with a median duration of 3 days from symptom onset to admission. Systemic hypertension was the commonest comorbid illness (25/102; 24.5%). Klebsiella pneumoniae was the predominant pathogen isolated (20/102; 28.1%). The susceptible antibiotics were Imipenem, Ceftazidime and Ceftriaxone. Intra-hospital mortality was 17.6%. CURB - 65 score of ≥ 2 and the presence of complications of CAP were the independent predictors of mortality. Conclusion CAP constitutes a significant disease burden in Ilorin, Nigeria. Typical bacteria accounted for over half of the pathogens isolated from the patients with gram negative agents predominating. This highlights a possible shift in the microbiological profile which could guide empirical treatment.","Ojuawo, Olutobi Babatope; Desalu, Olufemi Olumuyiwa; Fawibe, Ademola Emmanuel; Ojuawo, Ayotade Boluwatife; Aladesanmi, Adeniyi Olatunji; Opeyemi, Christopher Muyiwa; Adio, Mosunmoluwa Obafemi; Jimoh, Abdulraheem Olayemi; Amadu, Dele Ohinoyi; Fadeyi, Abayomi; Salami, Kazeem Alakija",African health sciences,https://doi.org/10.4314/ahs.v20i4.18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394226/,244

It consists of a cross-sectional and census-based study with data collected between August 2016 and February 2017. The dependent variables were body mass index (BMI) and height-for-age z-score, using Student's t-Test and ANOVA in the statistical analysis. A total of 67 children, 73.2% to 24 months of age and 34.3% being male, were evaluated. There was a significant proportion of families with per capita income of less than 1/4 of the minimum wage (65.6%), with no home monitoring for the family health strategy (88.1%), and long working hours for mothers (43.3%). The onset of prenatal care until the third month of pregnancy and female sex were associated with higher BMI averages. For height-for-age, an association with lower mean values was found for households with more than one resident per room, higher age range of the child, and child-care in daycare centers.

Infection control precautions for hospital visitors are needed to avoid cluster outbreaks, so this study investigated the visiting policies of all the hospitals in Taiwan in the time of COVID-19. METHODS From March 15, 2020, to March 18, 2020, we searched the official websites of all 472 National Health Insurance-contracted hospitals to determine their visiting policies. For those hospitals that had posted new visiting policies and still allowed visits to ordinary wards, we recorded the relevant details shown on their websites, including the number of visitors allowed at one time, the number of visiting slots per day, the total visiting hours per day, and the rules provided to visitors before visiting. RESULTS During the study period, 276 (58.5%) hospitals had posted new visiting policies on their websites, with higher proportions of academic medical centers (92.0%, 23/25) and metropolitan hospitals (91.5%, 75/82) than local community hospitals (48.8%, 178/365) doing so. Visits to ordinary wards were forbidden in 83 hospitals among those. Among the 193 hospitals that had new visiting policies and still allowed visits to ordinary wards, 73.1% (n = 141) restricted visitors to two at a time and 54.9% (n = 106) restricted visits to two visiting slots per day. Furthermore, history taking regarding travel, occupation, contacts, and cluster information was mentioned by 82.4% (n = 159) of these 193 hospitals, body temperature monitoring by 78.2% (n = 151), hand hygiene by 63.2% (n = 122), and identity checks by 51.8% (n = 100). CONCLUSION In the time of COVID-19 covered by this study, about three-fifths of the hospitals in Taiwan had posted their visiting policies for ordinary wards on their websites. Furthermore, the thoroughness with which such visiting policies have been enforced also requires investigation.","Liu, Ya-An; Hsu, Ya-Chuan; Lin, Ming-Hwai; Chang, Hsiao-Ting; Chen, Tzeng-Ji; Chou, Li-Fang; Hwang, Shinn-Jang",Journal of the Chinese Medical Association : JCMA,https://doi.org/10.1097/jcma.0000000000000326; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32502119/,244
90417,Dual antiplatelet therapy.,2013,"OBJECTIVES Despite the high prevalence of coronavirus and various treatment approaches, including complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), there is still no definitive treatment for coronavirus. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of CAM interventions on COVID-19 patients. CONTENT Four databases (Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and EMBASE) were searched from the inception of databases until July 16, 2020. Keywords included complementary and alternative medicine therapies and Coronavirus. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK Of the 1,137 studies searched, 14 studies performed on 972 COVID-19 patients entered the systematic review final stage. The results showed that different CAM interventions (acupuncture, Traditional Chinese medicine [TCM], relaxation, Qigong) significantly improved various psychological symptoms (depression, anxiety, stress, sleep quality, negative emotions, quality of life) and physical symptoms (inflammatory factors, physical activity, chest pain, and respiratory function) in COVID-19 patients. The results showed that various CAM interventions have a positive effect on improving the various dimensions of coronavirus disease but since there are few studies in this regard, further studies using different CAM approaches are recommended.","Badakhsh, Mahin; Dastras, Majid; Sarchahi, Zohreh; Doostkami, Mahboobe; Mir, Adel; Bouya, Salehoddin",Reviews on environmental health,https://doi.org/10.1515/reveh-2021-0012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33838089/,244
92222,Smoking cessation is associated with decreased mortality and improved amputation-free survival among patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease.,2014,"Since the discovery of manifest Zn deficiency in 1961, the increasing number of studies demonstrated the association between altered Zn status and multiple diseases. In this chapter, we provide a review of the most recent advances on the role of Zn in health and disease (2010-20), with a special focus on the role of Zn in neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders, diabetes and obesity, male and female reproduction, as well as COVID-19. In parallel with the revealed tight association between ASD risk and severity and Zn status, the particular mechanisms linking Zn2+ and ASD pathogenesis like modulation of synaptic plasticity through ProSAP/Shank scaffold, neurotransmitter metabolism, and gut microbiota, have been elucidated. The increasing body of data indicate the potential involvement of Zn2+ metabolism in neurodegeneration. Systemic Zn levels in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease were found to be reduced, whereas its sequestration in brain may result in modulation of amyloid β and α-synuclein processing with subsequent toxic effects. Zn2+ was shown to possess adipotropic effects through the role of zinc transporters, zinc finger proteins, and Zn-α2-glycoprotein in adipose tissue physiology, underlying its particular role in pathogenesis of obesity and diabetes mellitus type 2. Recent findings also contribute to further understanding of the role of Zn2+ in spermatogenesis and sperm functioning, as well as oocyte development and fertilization. Finally, Zn2+ was shown to be the potential adjuvant therapy in management of novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19), underlining the perspectives of zinc in management of old and new threats.","Skalny, Anatoly V; Aschner, Michael; Tinkov, Alexey A",Advances in food and nutrition research,https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.afnr.2021.01.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34112355/,244

METHODS This cross-sectional study of the 2017 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Open Payments Database was exempt from Institutional Review Board Review. We calculated descriptive statistics of the frequency, type, and amount (medians) of general, research, and ownerships transactions made to EPs from industry, described regional differences of median payments to EPs, and characterized the drugs or devices most commonly associated with transactions. RESULTS In 2017, among 40,899 practicing U.S. EPs, 14,447 (35.4%) received 51,870 general payments from industry totaling $12,870,832. The median per-physician payment was $18.30 (interquartile range [IQR], $13.63-$60.90). The most frequent transaction was food and beverage (89.6%), though most payments by dollar amount were related to speaker and consulting fees (74.5%). Antithrombotics were the most frequently drug or device associated with transactions. Only 35 (0.08%) and 20 (0.05%) EPs had research and ownership relationships with industry, respectively. A significant difference was observed in median payments per physician across all U.S. Census regions (p < 0.01) except when comparing Northeast and West (p = 1.00). CONCLUSIONS Over one-third of U.S. EPs had general payments from industry in 2017, while <1% of EPs had either research and ownership payments during this time period. Consistent with previous research, most payments to EPs are of low monetary value. Antithrombotics remain the most frequent drug associated with payments to EPs.","Niforatos, Joshua D; Boas, Samuel; Hertz, Samuel; Ozgur, Ahmed; Raja, Ali S",The American journal of emergency medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2018.12.039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30611579/,244
94345,Platelet-leukocyte rich gel application in the prevention of deep sternal wound problems after cardiac surgery in obese diabetic patients.,2019,"Dear editors: We propose novel strategies to combat the COVID-19 outbreak, that are aimed at high-risk groups and might reduce the progression to severe forms of COVID and thus decrease the very high case fatality rate.Following the first reports of the outbreak of several cases of acute respiratory distress syndrome in the Chinese city of Wuhan at the end of December 2019, a novel beta coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 or 2019-nCoV) as the main causative agent was identified while the disease associated with was named by WHO as COVID-19 (1, 2). The outbreak has rapidly spread globally with more than 150.000 cases detected in over 100 countries as of March 13, 2020. The overall case-fatality rate (CFR) of COVID-19 in China was 2.3 %, but globally it seems to be higher in the range of 3‒5 % (3). At present, no specific antivirals or approved vaccines are available to combat COVID-19. Many patients however receive off-label antivirals such as lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin and/or chloroquine and /or interferons. Several new antivirals such as remdesivir are studied in ongoing clinical trials. Given the alarming global situation and rapidly evolving large scale pandemics, there is an urgent need for effective strategies to prevent the spread of the disease and decrease its high CFR. The gravity of the situation requires to consider even novel unorthodox strategies to control the outbreak and high lethality of COVID-19. (Tab. 2, Ref. 21).

94402,Respiratory disturbances in fibromyalgia: a systematic review and meta-analysis of case control studies.,2021-04-15,"BACKGROUND International asthma guidelines recommend against epinephrine (adrenaline) administration in acute asthma unless associated with anaphylaxis or angio-oedema. However, administration of intramuscular epinephrine in addition to nebulised selective β2-agonist is recommended for acute severe or life-threatening asthma in many prehospital guidelines. We conducted a systematic review to determine the efficacy of epinephrine in comparison to selective β2-agonist in acute asthma. METHODS We included peer-reviewed publications of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that enrolled children or adults in any healthcare setting and compared epinephrine by any route to selective β2-agonist by any route for an acute asthma exacerbation. The primary outcome was treatment failure, including hospitalisation, need for intubation or death. RESULTS Thirty-eight of 1140 studies were included. Overall quality of evidence was low. Seventeen studies contributed data on 1299 participants to the meta-analysis. There was significant statistical heterogeneity, I2=56%. The pooled Peto's OR for treatment failure with epinephrine versus selective β2-agonist was 0.99 (0.75 to 1.32), p=0.95. There was strong evidence that recruitment age group was associated with different estimates of the odds of treatment failure; with studies recruiting adults-only having lower odds of treatment failure with epinephrine. It was not possible to determine whether epinephrine in addition to selective β2-agonist improved outcomes. CONCLUSION The low-quality evidence available suggests that epinephrine and selective β2-agonists have similar efficacy in acute asthma. There is a need for high-quality double-blind RCTs to determine whether addition of intramuscular epinephrine to inhaled or nebulised selective β2-agonist improves outcome.

Incidence during LARS with respect to usage/configuration of graft deployment is analyzed. Three-dimensional (3D) analysis of tack distribution provided anatomical insight to prevent cardiac injury. MATERIALS AND METHODS Data regarding the usage and configuration of graft deployment are retrieved from the prospective database. Grafting was ""posterior"" or ""posterior + anterior."" Incidence of CT in all hiatoplasties is calculated. Tomography is reconstructed in 3D, showing the spatial distribution of the tacks. Tacks are numbered in the surgical video. Corresponding numbering is applied to the tacks in any particular tomography slice, utilizing the 3D images as an interface. A numbering-blinded radiologist is asked to identify the offending and the nonoffending tacks as the cause of tamponade. Tack-to-pericardium distances are recorded. Tacks having no measurable distance from the pericardium are regarded as offensive. RESULTS One CT occurred in 1302 consecutive LARS (0.076%). The incidence is 0% when ""no"" (379) or ""posterior"" (880) graft is used as opposed to 2.3% rate in ""posterior + anterior"" (43) grafting. The distribution of ""offensive,"" ""nonoffensive but nearest,"" and ""safe"" tacks followed a pattern. All offensive tacks belonged to the anterior graft fixation, which we referred as the critical zone. CONCLUSION CT during LARS is rare, and associated with graft fixation anterior to the hiatal opening. Avoiding graft fixation to the critical zone may prevent cardiac injury.","Yerdel, Mehmet Ali; Şen, Ozan; Zor, Utku; Kara, Simay; Acunaş, Bülent",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

94719,Impact of YTHDF1 gene polymorphisms on Wilms tumor susceptibility: A five-center case-control study.,2021-06-21,"The specificity of SCF ubiquitin ligase-mediated protein degradation is determined by F-box proteins. We identified a biplanar dicarboxylic acid compound, called SCF-I2, as an inhibitor of substrate recognition by the yeast F-box protein Cdc4 using a fluorescence polarization screen to monitor the displacement of a fluorescein-labeled phosphodegron peptide. SCF-I2 inhibits the binding and ubiquitination of full-length phosphorylated substrates by SCF(Cdc4). A co-crystal structure reveals that SCF-I2 inserts itself between the beta-strands of blades 5 and 6 of the WD40 propeller domain of Cdc4 at a site that is 25 A away from the substrate binding site. Long-range transmission of SCF-I2 interactions distorts the substrate binding pocket and impedes recognition of key determinants in the Cdc4 phosphodegron. Mutation of the SCF-I2 binding site abrogates its inhibitory effect and explains specificity in the allosteric inhibition mechanism. Mammalian WD40 domain proteins may exhibit similar allosteric responsiveness and hence represent an extensive class of druggable target.","Orlicky, Stephen; Tang, Xiaojing; Neduva, Victor; Elowe, Nadine; Brown, Eric D; Sicheri, Frank; Tyers, Mike",Nature biotechnology,https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.1646; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20581844/,244

In this study, pacemakers encapsulated in a blood plasma-based material (PBM) composited with antibiotics were investigated for use as prophylactics against such infections. PBMs, which are made from pooled allogeneic plasma and platelets, are off-the-shelf biomaterials that can be manufactured in the form of complex 3D shapes, extrudable putties, or injectable pastes. In vitro studies with PBM pastes formulated with rifampicin and minocycline demonstrated antibiotic release over 6 days, activity against Escherichia coli, and reduced cytotoxic effects of the antibiotics on fibroblasts. The materials were also evaluated in vivo in a rabbit model in which pacemaker pockets were inoculated with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) strain and examined 1 week later. The pockets containing the pacemaker plus S. aureus were grossly purulent and culture positive, whereas pockets into which PBM with antibiotics were injected around the pacemaker were free of purulence and culture negative (p < 0.001). None of the pockets into which PBM without antibiotics were placed demonstrated purulence, but 60% were culture positive. These results demonstrate the potential of PBMs to deliver antibiotics to diminish the incidence of pocket infections for pacemakers and other implantable devices.","Schwartzman, David; Pasculle, A William; Ceceris, Kyra D; Smith, Jason D; Weiss, Lee E; Campbell, Phil G",Biomaterials,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.04.042; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25965281/,244

For this, the experimental conditions were optimized to obtain an efficient, sensitive, reversible, and highly selective chemosensor to Cu2+ ions. The complex stoichiometry was 1:1, with a formation constant of 5.82 × 102 L mol-1 and molar absorptivity of 5.82 × 103 mol L-1 cm-1. Then, a spectrophotometric analytical method was developed and validated according to the Brazilian legislation. The linearity of the analytical curve was demonstrated by ANOVA, at a confidence level of 95%. The limits of detection and quantification were 0.0659 and 0.200 mg L-1, respectively. The coefficients of variation for both the intra- and inter-day precisions were lower than 3.83%, and the accuracy presented a mean recovery of 100.55 ± 2.87%. The absence of a matrix effect was confirmed by the standard addition method, and the copper content in three artisanal cachaças from different geographical origins was estimated as lower than 2.93 mg L-1. This result was in accordance with the Brazilian legislation but reinforces the need to carry out stricter quality control to achieve exportation standards. Therefore, the proposed method can be considered a simple, selective, linear, precise, and accurate tool that involves only a simple complexation reaction through the addition of the chemosensor solution in a buffered medium. As a consequence, the simplicity, practicality, rapidity, and low cost of synthesis of the proposed Schiff base chemosensor are highlighted.","Onça, Larissa Oliveira; de Souza, Joseana Caroline Palmeira; Dos Santos, Izabela Gessyane Nogueira; Santos, Emerson de Sousa; Soares, Sérgio Macêdo; Diniz, Paulo Henrique Gonçalves Dias","Spectrochimica acta.

The aim of this study is to compare surgical outcome of the robotic gastric bypass with the laparoscopic counterpart. METHODS A retrospective study was conducted to compare the results of 100 fully robotic gastric bypasses (RGB) and 100 laparoscopic gastric bypasses (LGB) performed by a single surgeon. Surgical outcome was analysed by evaluating operation room time and surgical time, morbidity and mortality, and length of hospital stay. RESULTS In the RGB and LGB group, respectively, 92 and 80 % of operated patients were female (p = 0.024). Mean age was 39 (range 20-62, SD 10.21) and 42 years (range 18-65, SD 11.87), respectively (p = 0.158). Mean BMI was 40 (range 35-47, SD 2.66) and 42 (range 35-56, SD 4.75), respectively (p < 0.05). Mean surgical time was 67 (range 39-210, SD 22.46) and 31 min (range 18-62, SD 9.12), respectively (p < 0.05). Mean operation room time was 117 (range 80-257, SD 30.13) and 66 min (range 38-101, SD 12.68), respectively (p < 0.05). The surgery-related 30-day morbidity rate was 5 % in both groups. Major morbidity (Clavien-Dindo class 3-4) was 3 and 1 %, respectively (p = 0.62). There was no mortality. Median hospital stay was two postoperative days in both groups. A learning curve developed after 25 procedures. CONCLUSIONS The RGB is a feasible procedure.

97244,Targeting the forkhead box protein P1 pathway as a novel therapeutic approach for cardiovascular diseases.,2020-07-09,"BACKGROUND Female representation in surgery and surgical subspecialties has increased over the last decade. Studies have shown a discrepancy in compensation in the field of surgery, and several groups have advocated for increasing transparency as a primary solution to decrease this gender salary gap in surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate differences in compensation between genders in surgical specialties within a large academic healthcare system. METHODS Using a public compensation database from January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016, this retrospective observational study analyzed salaries of full-time faculty surgeons within a large multi-institutional academic healthcare system. Surgeons included those who were employed for the entirety of 2016 and were full-time faculty who were then stratified according to surgical specialty and rank. The median base and median total salaries were compared between male and female surgeons with adjustment for rank and surgical specialty. RESULTS There were 170 surgeons from eight surgical subspecialties included in the study with 29% being female (n = 50). Overall, unadjusted and adjusted median total salaries were significantly lower for female compared to male surgeons by $121,578 and $45,904, respectively. The three subspecialties with the highest compensation had a median total salary of $558,998 and had a high male to female ratio (3.7 male to 1 female), whereas the three subspecialties with the lowest compensation had a median total salary of $376,174 and had a male to female ratio of 1.5 male to 1 female. CONCLUSIONS In a large academic healthcare system with transparent and publicly accessible salaries, the gender compensation gap in surgery persists. In conjunction with transparency, future academic institutions should consider a value-based, objective compensation plan with personal and systemic introspection of traditional gender biases, in efforts to circumvent the impact of gender on salary.","Gambhir, Sahil; Daly, Shaun C; Elfenbein, Dawn; Sheehan, Brian; Maithel, Shelley; Smith, Megan; Nguyen, Ninh T",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-020-07679-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32488656/,244

BACKGROUND DEB have shown promising results in femoropopliteal lesions, but data for infrapopliteal lesions are scarce. METHODS In this prospective, multicenter, randomized first-in-man study, 72 patients were randomized 1:1 to either a Passeo-18 Lux DEB (Biotronik AG, Buelach, Switzerland) (n = 36) or Passeo-18 PTA (n = 36). Follow-up assessments were scheduled at 1, 6, and 12 months, with angiographic assessment at 6 months. Adverse events were adjudicated by an independent clinical events committee, and angiographic parameters were assessed by an independent core laboratory. RESULTS The primary safety endpoint (a composite of all-cause mortality, target extremity major amputation, target lesion thrombosis, and target vessel revascularization at 30 days) was 0% in the DEB group versus 8.3% in the PTA group (p = 0.239). The primary performance endpoint (patency loss at 6 months) was 17.1% in the DEB group versus 26.1% in the PTA group (p = 0.298), and major amputations of the target extremity occurred in 3.3% versus 5.6% of the patients at 12 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The Passeo-18 Lux DEB has been proven to be safe and effective in infrapopliteal lesions with comparable outcomes to PTA.","Zeller, Thomas; Beschorner, Ulrich; Pilger, Ernst; Bosiers, Marc; Deloose, Koen; Peeters, Patrick; Scheinert, Dierk; Schulte, Karl-Ludwig; Rastan, Aljoscha; Brodmann, Marianne",JACC.

RESULTS We performed 101 interventions and obtained the following results: Average age 60.89 ± 7.32 years (40-77), total PSA 8.5 ± 5.57 ng/dl (0.2-29); D'Amico classification: Low 29 (28.71%), Medium 65 (64.36%), High 7 (6.93%); Operative time 253.44 ± 51.51 min (90-540), Complications 12.9% (Clavien I-II 10.89% and Clavien IIIa 1.98%); Positive surgical margins 20.83%; Biochemistry recurrence 12.5% follow-up (6-44 months); and Continence 87.5% per year and Potency 59.52%. CONCLUSIONS RALRP is a safe and reproducible procedure with excellent results in terms of pentafecta, inclusive during the initial experience at a low volumen center for prostate cancer. A longer follow-up study and experience with higher volume of patients are required to obtain better results and data to be compared with excellence centers.","Gárate, J; Sánchez-Salas, R; Valero, R; Matheus, R; León, A; Dávila, H",Actas urologicas espanolas,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acuro.2013.12.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24974068/,244
98202,Takotsubo Syndrome: Finally Emerging From the Shadows?,2020-11-06,"Infection with obligatory intracellular bacteria is difficult to treat, as intracellular targets and delivery methods of therapeutics are not well known. Ehrlichia translocated factor-1 (Etf-1), a type IV secretion system (T4SS) effector, is a primary virulence factor for an obligatory intracellular bacterium, Ehrlichia chaffeensis In this study, we developed Etf-1-specific nanobodies (Nbs) by immunizing a llama to determine if intracellular Nbs block Etf-1 functions and Ehrlichia infection. Of 24 distinct anti-Etf-1 Nbs, NbD7 blocked mitochondrial localization of Etf-1-GFP in cotransfected cells. NbD7 and control Nb (NbD3) bound to different regions of Etf-1. Size-exclusion chromatography showed that the NbD7 and Etf-1 complex was more stable than the NbD3 and Etf-1 complex. Intracellular expression of NbD7 inhibited three activities of Etf-1 and E. chaffeensis: up-regulation of mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutase, reduction of intracellular reactive oxygen species, and inhibition of cellular apoptosis. Consequently, intracellular NbD7 inhibited Ehrlichia infection, whereas NbD3 did not. To safely and effectively deliver Nbs into the host cell cytoplasm, NbD7 was conjugated to cyclized cell-permeable peptide 12 (CPP12-NbD7). CPP12-NbD7 effectively entered mammalian cells and abrogated the blockade of cellular apoptosis caused by E. chaffeensis and inhibited infection by E. chaffeensis in cell culture and in a severe combined-immunodeficiency mouse model. Our results demonstrate the development of an Nb that interferes with T4SS effector functions and intracellular pathogen infection, along with an intracellular delivery method for this Nb. This strategy should overcome current barriers to advance mechanistic research and develop therapies complementary or alternative to the current broad-spectrum antibiotic.","Zhang, Wenqing; Lin, Mingqun; Yan, Qi; Budachetri, Khemraj; Hou, Libo; Sahni, Ashweta; Liu, Hongyan; Han, Nien-Ching; Lakritz, Jeffrey; Pei, Dehua; Rikihisa, Yasuko",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2024102118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33903242/,244
98893,Groin pain syndrome: an association of different pathologies and a case presentation.,2015,"In 2015, the first large-scale placebo-controlled trial designed to assess cardiovascular safety of glucose-lowering with sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibition in type 2 diabetes mellitus raised hypotheses that the class could favourably modify not only risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, but also hospitalisation for heart failure, and the development or worsening of nephropathy. By the start of 2021, results from ten large SGLT-2 inhibitor placebo-controlled clinical outcome trials randomizing ~71,000 individuals have confirmed that SGLT-2 inhibitors can provide clinical benefits for each of these types of outcome in a range of different populations. The cardiovascular and renal benefits of SGLT-2 inhibitors appear to be larger than their comparatively modest effect on glycaemic control or glycosuria alone would predict, with three trials recently reporting that clinical benefits extend to individuals without diabetes mellitus who are at risk due to established heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, or albuminuric chronic kidney disease. This ESC position paper summarizes reported results from these ten large clinical outcome trials considering separately each of the different types of cardiorenal benefit, summarises key molecular and pathophysiological mechanisms, and provides a synopsis of metabolic effects and safety. We also describe two ongoing placebo-controlled trials among individuals with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and one among individuals with chronic kidney disease.

Most children acquire infection from an adult household member. Children may stay asymptomatic, have a pre-symptomatic stage, or present with symptoms (fever, cough, and difficulty breathing being the most common). Nearly one-third of the pediatric cases (32%) in the United States occurred in children age 15 to 17 years. Children are also at risk of a postinfectious hyperinflammatory syndrome called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). The risk of vertical transmission is low (2%) in newborns of mothers with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) is the gold standard for (SARS-CoV-2). Serology should be considered in a child with high clinical suspicion for COVID-19 when NAAT is negative and at least 2 weeks have passed since symptom onset and for assessment of MIS-C. Easy fatigability after COVID-19 infection is reported in adults; however, data in children are lacking.

While the detrimental impact of job insecurity on safety outcomes has been extensively investigated, no study has examined the concurrent role of financial stress let alone their emotion-related predictors. OBJECTIVE The present cross-country research sought to identify the simultaneous effects of affective job insecurity and financial stress in predicting employee safety injuries and accidents under-reporting, and to examine the extent to which emotional contagion of positive/negative emotions at work contribute to the level of experienced economic stress. METHODS We performed multi-group measurement and structural invariance analyses. RESULTS Data from employees in the U.S. (N = 498) and Italy (N = 366) suggest that financial stress is the primary mediator between emotional contagion and poor safety outcomes. Moreover, greater anger-contagion predicted higher levels of financial strain and job insecurity whereas greater joy-contagion predicted reduced economic stress. CONCLUSIONS Our findings support the relevance of considering the concurrent role of income-and employment-related stressors as predictors of safety-related outcomes. Theoretical and practical implications for safety are discussed in light of the globally increasing emotional pressure and concerns of income- and employment-related economic stress in today's workplace, particularly given the recent pandemic spread of Corona virus disease (COVID-19).","Petitta, Laura; Probst, Tahira M; Ghezzi, Valerio; Barbaranelli, Claudio",Work,https://doi.org/10.3233/wor-203182; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32568157/,244

METHODS Existing guidelines and research data were reviewed to answer the questions. RESULTS There is consensus about the type of anaesthesia used during ECT, what constitutes AGPs and what PPE should be used. It was not clear if ECT was an AGP, but we argue that it is one based on evidence. CONCLUSION We conclude that ECT is an AGP and that it requires the appropriate use of PPE after taking in to account local supply and demand.","Purushothaman, Subramanian; Fung, David; Reinders, Jonathan; Garett-Walcott, Simone; Buda, Margaret; Moudgil, Vikas; Emmerson, Brett",Australasian psychiatry : bulletin of Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists,https://doi.org/10.1177/1039856220953699; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32910692/,244

The European Union (EU) has enacted several iterations of the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive to address this complex waste stream. However, recycling dominates treatments for e-waste, despite the established 'waste hierarchy' showing waste prevention and reuse are generally preferable to recycling. This paper reports on 30 semi-structured interviews, undertaken across the EEE value chain, examining the impact of the WEEE Directive in the UK. The interviews confirmed that reuse takes place for a limited number of product types, mostly on a small scale. Additionally, whilst legislation has prompted innovation in recycling and higher capture rates, resource recovery is in practice limited to easily salvageable materials, whilst recovery of critical raw materials is often neglected. Furthermore, there is confusion around available collection networks, particularly for small WEEE, which consistently appears in residual waste streams. The waste hierarchy remains the key component of EU waste strategy and moving to the higher levels of the waste hierarchy is an essential part of achieving sustainable waste management and moving towards a circular economy. The paper proposes a series of measures to this end: promoting recovery routes and practices that facilitate reuse of suitable products, adapting recycling technology to increase recovery of critical raw materials and targeted policies to encourage the application of the waste hierarchy within a resource efficiency-oriented framework.","Cole, Christine; Gnanapragasam, Alex; Cooper, Tim; Singh, Jagdeep",Waste management,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2019.01.046; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109542/,244

A convenience sample of 902 Israeli adults (mean age = 46.21) completed measures of peritraumatic distress, anxiety symptoms and resilience, and reported on their media use experiences one month following the initial outbreak of the disease in Israel (April 2020). After controlling for COVID-19 related events and demographic covariates, experiencing media use as having a negative impact on coping was related to higher levels of peritraumatic distress and anxiety symptoms and lower levels of resilience. In contrast, experiencing media as having a positive impact was not related to peritraumatic distress, anxiety symptoms or resilience. The findings suggest that those reporting that media use had a negative impact on coping are at greater risk of experiencing higher levels of peritraumatic distress and anxiety symptoms as well as lower resilience. In addition, traditional media use was related to higher resiliency. Developing understanding of how media could be used to optimally support emergency responses is crucial in order to minimize psychopathology.

104224,Conceiving MitraClip as a tool: percutaneous edge-to-edge repair in complex mitral valve anatomies.,2020-05-14,"OPINION STATEMENT Barrett's esophagus (BE) is the most important risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma. Through the sequence of no dysplasia to low-grade dysplasia (LGD) and high-grade dysplasia (HGD), eventually early cancer (EC) may develop. The risk of neoplastic progression is relatively low, 0.5-0.9 % per patient per year. However, once diagnosed, esophageal adenocarcinoma is often irresectable, and 5-year survival is only 15 %. Therefore, non-dysplastic BE patients are kept under endoscopic surveillance to detect early neoplasia in a curable stage. In case of LGD confirmed by an expert pathologist, risk of neoplastic progression is high. In these confirmed LGD patients, prophylactic ablation using radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of the Barrett's segment has proven to significantly reduce risk of neoplastic progression. Once patients are diagnosed with HGD or EC, they have a clear indication for endoscopic treatment. The cornerstone for endoscopic management of early Barrett's neoplasia is endoscopic resection of mucosal abnormalities. Endoscopic resection (ER) provides a large tissue specimen for accurate histological evaluation to select those patients for further endoscopic management, who have neoplasia limited to the mucosa, well to moderately differentiated and without lymph-vascular invasion. After ER, the remainder of the Barrett's mucosa can be eradicated with RFA, to prevent occurrence of metachronous lesions.","Belghazi, Kamar; Cipollone, Ilaria; Bergman, Jacques J G H M; Pouw, Roos E",Current treatment options in gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11938-016-0080-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26891725/,244

While no drugs have yet been approved to treat this disease, small molecules effective against other viral infections are under clinical evaluation for therapeutic abatement of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Ongoing clinical trials include Kaletra (a combination of two protease inhibitors approved for HIV treatment), remdesivir (an investigational drug targeting RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [RdRP] of SARS-CoV-2), and hydroxychloroquine (an approved anti-malarial and immuno-modulatory drug). Since SARS-CoV-2 replication depends on three virally encoded proteins (RdRP, papain-like proteinase, and helicase), we screened 54 FDA-approved antiviral drugs and ~3300 investigational drugs for binding to these proteins using targeted and unbiased docking simulations and computational modeling. Elbasvir, a drug approved for treating hepatitis C, is predicted to bind stably and preferentially to all three proteins. At the therapeutic dosage, elbasvir has low toxicity (liver enzymes transiently elevated in 1% of subjects) and well-characterized drug-drug interactions. We predict that treatment with elbasvir, alone or in combination with other drugs such as grazoprevir, could efficiently block SARS-CoV-2 replication. The concerted action of elbasvir on at least three targets essential for viral replication renders viral mutation to drug resistance extremely unlikely.","Balasubramaniam, Meenakshisundaram; Reis, Robert J Shmookler",ChemRxiv : the preprint server for chemistry,https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv.12084822.v2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32511290/,244

However, high levels of disease or mortality in such flocks impair economic development and challenge the livelihoods of many rural households. We investigated 61 diseased small-scale flocks (122 chickens) for evidence of infection with 5 bacteria, 4 viruses, and helminths. Serological profiles (ELISA) were also determined against 6 of these pathogens. The aims of this study were the following: (1) to investigate the prevalence of different pathogens and to compare the probability of detection of bacterial pathogens using PCR and culture; (2) to investigate the relationship between detection of organisms in birds' tissues and the observed morbidity and mortality, as well as their antibody profile; and (3) to characterize risk factors for infection with specific viral or bacterial pathogens. We used PCR to test for viral (viruses causing infectious bronchitis [IB], highly pathogenic avian influenza [HPAI], Newcastle disease, and infectious bursal disease [IBD]) and bacterial pathogens (Mycoplasma gallisepticum, Pasteurella multocida, Avibacterium paragallinarum, and Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale [ORT]). The latter two were also investigated in respiratory tissues by conventional culture. Colisepticemic Escherichia coli was investigated by liver or spleen culture. In 49 of 61 (80.3%) flocks, at least one bacterial or viral pathogen was detected, and in 29 (47.5%) flocks, more than one pathogen was detected. A. paragallinarum was detected in 62.3% flocks, followed by M. gallisepticum (26.2%), viruses causing IBD (24.6%) and IB (21.3%), septicemic E. coli (14.8%), ORT (13.1%), and HPAI viruses (4.9%). Of all flocks, 67.2% flocks were colonized by helminths. Mortality was highest among flocks infected with HPAI (100%, interquartile range [IQR]: 81.6-100%) and lowest with flocks infected with ORT (5.3%, IQR: 1.1-9.0%). The results indicated slight agreement (kappa ≤ 0.167) between detection by PCR and culture for both A. paragallinarum and ORT, as well as between the presence of cestodes and ORT infection (kappa = 0.317). Control of A. paragallinarum, viruses causing HPAI, IBD, and IB, M. gallisepticum, and gastrointestinal helminths should be a priority in small-scale flocks.","Van, Nguyen Thi Bich; Yen, Nguyen Thi Phuong; Nhung, Nguyen Thi; Cuong, Nguyen Van; Kiet, Bach Tuan; Hoang, Nguyen Van; Hien, Vo Be; Chansiripornchai, Niwat; Choisy, Marc; Ribas, Alexis; Campbell, James; Thwaites, Guy; Carrique-Mas, Juan",Poultry science,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psj.2019.10.033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32036978/,244

It seems that the modern scholarship focusing on ""success stories"" tends to neglect counterintuitive examples such as the impact of economic crises on research. We argue that economic difficulties, under certain circumstances, may also lead to the prosperous development of scientific institutions. This paper focuses on a particular organism, the Pine Institute in Bordeaux in France. Not only was it a key actor in the process of defining the discipline of resin chemistry, but also it remained for years at the heart of the local resin producing industry. Interestingly, there is an actual inverse correlation between the Institute's budgets and the prices and production of resinous products. The Pine Institute's existence seemed to have been driven by the crisis of the resin industry.","Krasnodębski, Marcin",Science in context,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0269889717000035; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28397647/,244

However, there is limited information on risk factors and interventions that improve the primary prevention and management of T2DM in rural areas. To synthesize current knowledge on T2DM in rural areas and to guide healthcare providers and policy makers, we reviewed five scientific databases and the grey literature over the last decade (2010-2020). We described classification systems for rurality and the T2DM burden based on rurality and region (West, South, Midwest, and Northeast). We highlighted risk factors for T2DM in rural compared to urban areas, and summarized interventions to screen and manage T2DM based on opportunistic screening, T2DM self-management, community-based initiatives, as well as interventions targeting comorbidities and T2DM. Several studies identified the co-existence of T2DM and depression/psychological symptoms, which could reduce adherence to non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic management of T2DM. We highlighted the role of technology in education and counselling of patients with geographic and financial barriers to accessing care, which is exacerbated by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus disease-19 pandemic. We identified knowledge gaps and next steps in improving T2DM care in rural areas. There is an urgent need for interventions tailored to rural areas given that rural Americans currently experience a disproportionate burden of T2DM and are encumbered by its associated morbidity, mortality, and loss in economic productivity.","Dugani, Sagar B; Mielke, Michelle M; Vella, Adrian",Diabetes/metabolism research and reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/dmrr.3410; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33021052/,244

The nationwide lockdown in the United Kingdom in spring 2020 provided a unique government-mandated experiment to observe the temporal variation of psychometric indicators in the absence of certain specific social rhythms related to commuting and workplace social activities as well as many normal home-based social activities. We therefore analyzed the aggregated Twitter content of 54 UK cities in the 9 weeks of complete lockdown, comparing them with the 10 weeks that preceded them (as well as with the corresponding weeks of 2019). We observed that the key indicators of emotion retained their diurnal behavior. This suggests that even during lockdown there are still sufficient zeitgebers to maintain this diurnal variation in indicators of emotion.","Wang, Sheng; Lightman, Stafford; Cristianini, Nello",Chronobiology international,https://doi.org/10.1080/07420528.2021.1937198; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34134583/,244

111880,Prevalence of Subclinical Coronary Artery Disease in Masters Endurance Athletes With a Low Atherosclerotic Risk Profile.,2017,"OBJECTIVE Various studies investigated implicit sequence learning in Parkinson's disease (PD) by means of the traditional motor Serial Reaction Time (SRT) task and found a general pattern of impaired sequence learning. However, as perceptual and motor sequences of the SRT-task were correlated in previous studies, implicit sequential knowledge acquisition that is tested independently from motor sequences remains to be determined in PD. In this study, we investigated implicit sequence learning independently from motor sequence learning in individuals with PD. To this end, we used a perceptual SRT-task that did not rely upon sequential motor knowledge. METHOD We measured response times (RTs) of 19 participants with PD (Hoehn & Yahr II or III; mean age 65) and 18 age-matched healthy controls (HC; mean age 61.5) in a perceptual SRT-task. General learning effects and sequence-specific learning effects were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVAs. RESULTS A significant decreasing linear trend (p < .001) in RTs was revealed in both the PD and HC groups as the SRT-task progressed, indicating general learning effects. Notably, a significant, strong main effect of sequence-specific learning occurred (p < .001), irrespective of group (p = .436). Sequence-specific learning did not differ significantly between the PD (M = 156.5 ms; SD = 50.7) and HC group (M = 173.0 ms; SD = 104.2). Bayesian analyses confirmed this as evidence of absence of an effect (B₁₀ = 3.543). CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that, at least in Hoehn & Yahr stages II and III, implicit sequential knowledge acquisition may be preserved in individuals with PD, when tested independently from motor sequence learning.

Whether the round ligament of uterus should be divided to facilitate mesh placement remains controversial. This study aims to review the outcomes of laparoscopic total extraperitoneal (TEP) groin hernia repair in women and to evaluate the impact of division of round ligament. Methods: Consecutive female patients with inguinal or femoral hernias who underwent elective laparoscopic TEP repair at a single institution from 2006 to 2017 were included for retrospective analysis. Primary outcomes were postoperative pain, genital prolapse, and recurrence. Outcomes of patients who had the round ligament divided were further compared with those with round ligament preserved and multivariable adjusted analysis was performed. Results: Sixty-eight patients with a total of 77 TEP repairs were included in the 12-year study period. The mean age was 45 ± 16 years old. Incidental femoral hernia was identified in 4 patients (5.9%). There was 1 (1.3%) recurrence upon mean follow-up of 42.9 ± 37.3 months. The round ligament was divided in 67.5% of patients, and upon multivariable adjusted analysis, there were no statistically significant differences in outcomes in terms of chronic pain (odds ratio [OR] = 2.210, P = .357), paresthesia (OR = 0.241, P = .149), and genital prolapse (OR = 0.327, P = .415) when compared with patients with preserved round ligament. Conclusion: Laparoscopic groin hernia repair in women is associated with low recurrence. Division of round ligament intraoperatively facilitates mesh placement and has minimal impact on clinical outcomes.","Luk, Yan; Chau, Pui Ling; Law, Tsz Ting; Ng, Lily; Wong, Kin Yuen",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

Methods: Anti-PD-L1 antibodies underwent sulfohydryl moiety-specific conjugation with maleimide-deferoxamine (DFO) followed by 89Zr radiolabeling. 89Zr-PD-L1 IgG was evaluated for radiochemical purity, specific activity and radiolabel stability. Parental CT26 colon cancer cells and CT26/PD-L1 cells engineered to stably overexpress PD-L1 underwent binding assays, flow cytometry, and Western blotting. In vivo pharmacokinetics was evaluated and tumor-bearing mice underwent biodistribution and PET studies after 89Zr-PD-L1 IgG injection. Results: 89Zr-PD-L1 IgG synthesis was straightforward and efficient. SDS PAGE showed that reduction with TCEP produced half-antibody fragments and MALDI-TOF analysis estimated 2.18 DFOs conjugated per antibody, indicting site-specific conjugation at the hinge region disulfide bonds. High expressing CT26/PD-L1 cells showed 102.2 ± 6.7-fold greater 89Zr-PD-L1 IgG binding compared to weak expressing CT26 cells. Excellent target specificity was confirmed by a drastic reduction of CT26/PD-L1 cell binding to 3.0 ± 0.8% by excess cold antibody. Intravenous 89Zr-PD-L1 IgG followed bi-exponential blood clearance. Tissue activity assessed by PET/CT demonstrated decreases in major organ activity over 7 days, whereas high CT26/PD-L1 tumor activity was maintained. Again, this was suppressed by excess cold antibody. Treatment of CT26 cells with gemcitabine for 24 h augmented PD-L1 protein to 592.4 ± 114.2% of controls and increased 89Zr-PD-L1 IgG binding. This was accompanied by increased AKT activation and reduced PTEN. In CT26 tumor mice, gemcitabine treatment substantially increased tumor uptake from 1.56 ± 0.48 to 6.24 ± 0.37 %ID/g (tumor/blood ratio: 34.7). Immunoblots revealed significant increases in tumor PD-L1 and activated AKT and a decrease of PTEN. Conclusion: 89Zr-PD-L1 IgG showed specific targeting with favorable pharmacokinetic and PET imaging properties. Gemcitabine treatment upregulated cancer cell and tumor PD-L1 expression and increased 89Zr-PD-L1 IgG uptake. 89Zr-PD-L1 IgG PET may thus be useful for monitoring chemotherapy-mediated tumor PD-L1 modulation in living subjects.","Jung, Kyung-Ho; Park, Jin Won; Lee, Jin Hee; Lee, Eun Ji; Moon, Seung Hwan; Cho, Young Seok; Lee, Kyung-Han","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",https://doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.120.250720; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32917780/,244
112944,Involvement of the Mediastinal Subpleural Pulmonary Parenchyma on Chest CT in COVID-19 patients: A Case Series.,2020-11-01,"Altered mRNA translational control is emerging as a critical factor in cancer development and progression. Targeting specific elements of the translational machinery, such as mTORC1 or eIF4E, is emerging as a new strategy for innovative cancer therapy. While translation of most mRNAs takes place through cap-dependent mechanisms, a sub-population of cellular mRNA species, particularly stress-inducible mRNAs with highly structured 5'-UTR regions, are primarily translated through cap-independent mechanisms. Intriguingly, many of these mRNAs encode proteins that are involved in tumour cell adaptation to microenvironmental stress, and thus linked to aggressive behaviour including tumour invasion and metastasis. This necessitates a rigorous search for links between microenvironmental stress and aggressive tumour phenotypes. Under stress, cells block global protein synthesis to preserve energy while maintaining selective synthesis of proteins that support cell survival. One highly conserved mechanism to regulate protein synthesis under cell stress is to sequester mRNAs into cytosolic aggregates called stress granules (SGs), where their translation is silenced. SGs confer survival advantages and chemotherapeutic resistance to tumour cells under stress. Recently, it has been shown that genetically blocking SG formation dramatically reduces tumour invasive and metastatic capacity in vivo. Therefore, targeting SG formation might represent a potential treatment strategy to block cancer metastasis. Here, we present the critical link between selective mRNA translation, stress adaptation, SGs, and tumour progression. Further, we also explain how deciphering mechanisms of selective mRNA translation occurs under cell stress holds great promise for the identification of new targets in the treatment of cancer.

PATIENTS AND METHODS The study was initiated as pilot study; the participants were grouped into three based on the suture material used for VUA, i.e., monofilament Polyglecaprone-25 (group 1), unidirectional barbed Glycolic acid-trimethylene carbonate (group 2), and bidirectional barbed Polyglycolic acid-polycaprolactone (group 3), respectively. Group 1 was included retrospectively and the latter two prospectively. All cases were operated upon by the same surgeon, proficient in RARP. Patient-demographics, intraoperative and peri-operative data were collected. Our technique of mucosa-to-mucosa VUA is carried out in a choreographed manner using unibarbed suture. RESULTS Fifty-five patients were included; 25 each in group 1 and 2. The group 3 was prematurely closed after 5 cases due to perceived inappropriateness of needle characteristics of the suture material. Therefore, the statistical analysis was performed between group 1 and 2 only. Preoperative characteristics including age, PSA, clinical stage, and biopsy grade were similar between the groups. The anastomosis time was significantly less in group 2 (8.4 ± 1.7 min vs. 14.3 ± 4.8 min; P = 0.0001; t test). Postoperative hospital stay was less in group 2 (2.7 ± 1.1 days vs. 1.9 ± 0.8 days; P = 0.023; Mann-Whitney U). None of the patient had presented with urinary leaks, urinary retention, or anastomotic strictures at follow-up of 6 months. CONCLUSION VUA with unidirectional barbed suture is safe and takes less time compared to monofilament suture as repeated cinching; help of assistance and knot tying are not required by virtue of its self-retaining characteristics.","Hemal, Ashok K; Agarwal, Mayank Mohan; Babbar, P",International urology and nephrology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11255-011-9967-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21523325/,244

METHODS This study was a retrospective study based on a multicenter prospective cohort registry from December 2013 to April 2016. According to the 28-day cerebral performance categories (CPCs) scale, patients were divided into the good-outcome group (CPC 1-2) and the poor-outcome group (CPC 3-5). We compared the two groups with respect to demographic variables, prehospital and in-hospital resuscitation variables, and postresuscitation variables. RESULTS A total of 869 cardiac arrest victims who received in-progress cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) were delivered to the emergency department of three hospitals, and 310 patients were admitted to the intensive care unit. The use of a prehospital SGA was independently associated with 28-day good neurologic outcome (odds ratio [OR] = 7.88; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.33-46.53; p = 0.023] when postresuscitation variables were adjusted, although there were no significant association with the acquisition of sustained return of spontaneous circulation (OR = 0.992; 95% CI = 0.591-1.666; p = 0.976).

Surgical robotic systems offer enhanced articulation, but at substantial financial costs. This has motivated the development of high-dexterity, low-cost laparoscopic instruments. AREAS COVERED This article reviews both commercial and academic results on creating fully mechanical (i.e. non-robotic) laparoscopic instruments that provide wrists or wrist-like dexterity within the patient. We review the state of the art in the development of these mechanical instruments, focusing on the surgeon interface, wrist mechanism, and the kinematic mapping between the two. Expert commentary: Current articulated mechanical laparoscopic instruments exhibit a wide range of designs, with no clear consensus on what makes such devices easy to use. As these technologies mature, user studies are needed to determine surgeon preferences. Articulated, low-cost instruments have the potential to impact the minimally invasive surgery market if they provide compelling benefits to surgeons.","Anderson, Patrick L; Lathrop, Ray A; Webster, Robert J",Expert review of medical devices,https://doi.org/10.1586/17434440.2016.1146585; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26808896/,244
115525,Histological diagnosis of immune checkpoint inhibitor induced acute renal injury in patients with metastatic melanoma: a retrospective case series report.,2020-09-07,"A computer-assisted human peripheral blood leukocyte image classification method based on Siamese network is proposed. Firstly, a Siamese network with two identical convolutional neural network (CNN) sub-networks and a logistic regression for leukocyte five classification is designed, which can learn not only distinguishing features but also a similarity metric. Then for each category of the leukocytes, a typical sample is selected by the hematologist. To train the Siamese network, a leukocyte and a typical sample that belong to the same category make up a genuine pair and the leukocyte with the rest four typical samples respectively make up four impostor pairs. Obviously, the number of the genuine pairs is lesser than that of the impostor pairs. Thus, a data augmentation method suitable for leukocyte is used to enrich the amount of the genuine pairs. By training the Siamese network using the genuine pairs and impostor pairs, the Siamese network can not only shorten the similarity metric between the leukocyte and the same category of the typical sample but also increase the similarity metrics between the leukocyte and the different categories of the typical samples. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method can achieve 98.8% average testing accuracy.

METHODOLOGY Four different strengths (1T, 2T, 3T and 4T) of the pulsed magnetic field (PMF) were applied in thirty repetitions to bacterial suspension. A pickup coil setup was used to measure the electromotive force induced inside the bacterial suspensions. The optical density (OD) was monitored over time (for 16 h 40 min) during the post-treatment period to assess bacterial growth. Along with the change in OD-values, live/dead assay, membrane depolarization study, atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) assay on selected samples were studied to evaluate the effect of PMFs. All results were analysed using one-way ANOVA followed by post hoc Tukey test and considered significant at p < 0.05. Regression analysis (at a confidence of 95%, α = 0.05) was performed on the bacterial growth and membrane depolarization studies to determine progressive changes of the outcomes. RESULTS The peak value of the induced electromotive force was recorded as 0.25 V, for the 4 T magnetic field pulse with a pulse-width of 16 ms. There was a significant arrest of bacterial cell growth after an exposure to PMFs of 1 T, 3 T, 4 T (ANOVA score: F (4, 495) = 395.180 at p = 0.05). The image-based qualitative results of the live/dead assay using fluorescence microscopy techniques indicated that an exposure to higher PMFs (3 T/ 4 T) induced a bacteriostatic effect in a longer post-exposure timescale. Evidence of altered membrane-potential within the 2 h of exposure to 4 T PMF were supported by the incidence of elevated ROS. For the ROS assay, a significant difference occurred for 4 T exposed samples (ANOVA score: calculated F (1, 3) = 20.2749 at p = 0.05). SEM and AFM observations corroborated with the outcomes, by portraying significant membrane damage. CONCLUSION In a laboratory setting, PMFs with higher magnitudes (3 T and 4 T) were capable of inducing bacteriostatic effects on E. faecalis.","Naskar, Sharmistha; Chandan,; Baskaran, Divya; Roy Choudhury, Aditya N; Chatterjee, Subhomoy; Karunakaran, Subbaraj; Murthy, B V Sreenivasa; Basu, Bikramjit",International endodontic journal,https://doi.org/10.1111/iej.13580; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34046919/,244

Besides, social media platforms and technological advances also appear to be another potential tool for promoting health and wellbeing, however, the capability of these interventions during the pandemic era is largely unknown. To explore the possible role of technological advances and social media platforms as an alternate tool in promoting a healthy living style during the COVID-19 era. The studies with the predefined criteria were used to synthesize information regarding the opportunities and challenges. Studies delivering lifestyle intervention using social media platforms, technologies for health promotion were considered for the review. The studies included to synthesize evidence were randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews and meta-analysis. Database like Medline, Scopus, and Science Direct were searched independently by two reviewers. A total of 17 studies were included in the review, Internet and lifestyle modification n = 2, mHealth and lifestyle modification n = 3, Social media and lifestyle modifications n = 3, technology adoption for lifestyle modification n = 4, and hazards = 5. Technology and social media-based interventions appear to be a promising technique for promoting health and wellbeing and it is the only effective method for delivering an intervention during a pandemic situation. However, there also appears a need for the development of guidelines for social media usage to prevent probable hazards.","Dixit, Snehil; Nandakumar, Girish",Reviews in cardiovascular medicine,https://doi.org/10.31083/j.rcm.2021.01.187; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33792253/,244

However, only few studies have analyzed the costs associated with mHealth solutions for HIV care. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to estimate the total incremental costs and incremental cost per beneficiary of an interactive SMS text messaging support intervention within a clinical trial. METHODS The Mobile WAChX trial (NCT02400671) evaluates an interactive semiautomated SMS text messaging intervention to improve adherence to antiretroviral therapy and retention in care among peripartum women infected with HIV in Kenya to reduce the mother-to-child transmission of HIV. Women were randomized to receive one-way versus two-way SMS text messages. Messages were sent weekly, and these messages included motivational and educational content and visit reminders; two-way messaging enabled prompt consultation with the nurse as needed. Microcosting methods were used to collect resource-use data related to implementing the Mobile WAChX SMS text messaging intervention. At 2 sites (Nairobi and Western Kenya), we conducted semistructured interviews with health personnel to identify startup and recurrent activities by obtaining information on the personnel, supplies, and equipment. Data on expenditures and prices from project expense reports, administrative records, and published government salary data were included to estimate the total incremental costs. Using a public provider perspective, we estimated incremental unit costs per beneficiary and per contact during 2017. RESULTS The weighted average annual incremental costs for the two-way SMS text messaging group were US $3725 per facility, US $62 per beneficiary, and US $0.85 per contact to reach 115 beneficiaries. For the one-way SMS text messaging group, the weighted average annual incremental costs were US $2542 per facility, US $41 per beneficiary, and US $0.66 per contact to reach 117 beneficiaries. The largest cost shares were for the personnel: 48.2% (US $1794/US $3725) in two-way and 32.4% (US $825/US $2542) in one-way SMS text messaging groups. Costs associated with software development and communication accounted for 29.9% (US $1872/US $6267) of the costs in both intervention arms (US $1042 vs US $830, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Cost information for budgeting and financial planning is relevant for implementing mHealth interventions in national health plans. Given the proportion of costs related to systems development, it is likely that costs per beneficiary will decline with the scale-up of the interventions.","Chen, Yilin; Ronen, Keshet; Matemo, Daniel; Unger, Jennifer A; Kinuthia, John; John-Stewart, Grace; Levin, Carol",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,https://doi.org/10.2196/18351; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33006562/,244

However, there are few reports regarding the prescription pattern of the triple-whammy. Objective To elucidate the patterns of the triple-whammy prescription in Japan. Methods A cross-sectional study was performed using a health-insurance-claims database that included Japanese people under 75 years of age, and enrolled outpatients that were prescribed any nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers, and diuretics between April 2017 and June 2017. As an outcome, the proportion of triple-whammy prescriptions was evaluated. Among the patients who received triple-whammy prescriptions, we evaluated the prevalence of chronic kidney disease and the proportion of prescriptions provided for these three drugs from different clinical departments and institutions. Results Overall, 730 of 246,721 (0.3%) patients received triple-whammy prescriptions. Among these patients, 13.3% had underlying chronic kidney disease. The proportions of any of the three drug types prescribed by different clinical departments and institutions was 48.2% and 61.8%, respectively. Conclusions We examined the patterns of triple-whammy prescriptions and concluded that pharmacists need to pay attention to triple-whammy prescriptions if the prescriptions are provided by multiple clinical departments or institutions.","Imai, Shungo; Momo, Kenji; Kashiwagi, Hitoshi; Miyai, Takayuki; Sugawara, Mitsuru; Takekuma, Yoh",International journal of clinical pharmacy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11096-020-01088-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803559/,244

Telehealth is broadly defined as a method to have virtual, bidirectional communication between patients and providers. Telehealth can include methods such as audio-only, video-consultation, and tele-monitoring, which can occur in a synchronous, asynchronous, or blended format. The purpose of this review is to present common foundational principles for providing clinical cancer care via telehealth, followed by an overview of three distinct examples of comprehensive telehealth programs that have been developed to meet the needs of patients and families across the cancer trajectory, including survivorship, rehabilitation, and palliative care phases. The programs described are exemplars that were developed and implemented prior to the coronavirus pandemic, so they reflect many years of planning and evidence. Lessons learned include the need for ongoing patient support, clinician training, and cancer health system/practice programmatic considerations such as billing, scheduling, reimbursement, software, and hardware/platform security. Although the COVID-19 pandemic produced an explosive shift in regulations and implementation, sustainability of these changes may not be long-term. Nevertheless, a permanent shift in cancer care to include telehealth is likely here to stay.","Bakitas, Marie; Cheville, Andrea L; Mulvey, Therese Marie; Peppercorn, Jeffrey; Watts, Kristen; Dionne-Odom, J Nicholas",American Society of Clinical Oncology educational book.

120901,"Heart failure and kidney dysfunction: epidemiology, mechanisms and management.",2016,"BACKGROUND Alteplase is effective for treatment of acute ischaemic stroke but debate continues about its use after longer times since stroke onset, in older patients, and among patients who have had the least or most severe strokes. We assessed the role of these factors in affecting good stroke outcome in patients given alteplase. METHODS We did a pre-specified meta-analysis of individual patient data from 6756 patients in nine randomised trials comparing alteplase with placebo or open control. We included all completed randomised phase 3 trials of intravenous alteplase for treatment of acute ischaemic stroke for which data were available. Retrospective checks confirmed that no eligible trials had been omitted. We defined a good stroke outcome as no significant disability at 3-6 months, defined by a modified Rankin Score of 0 or 1. Additional outcomes included symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (defined by type 2 parenchymal haemorrhage within 7 days and, separately, by the SITS-MOST definition of parenchymal type 2 haemorrhage within 36 h), fatal intracranial haemorrhage within 7 days, and 90-day mortality. FINDINGS Alteplase increased the odds of a good stroke outcome, with earlier treatment associated with bigger proportional benefit. Treatment within 3·0 h resulted in a good outcome for 259 (32·9%) of 787 patients who received alteplase versus 176 (23·1%) of 762 who received control (OR 1·75, 95% CI 1·35-2·27); delay of greater than 3·0 h, up to 4·5 h, resulted in good outcome for 485 (35·3%) of 1375 versus 432 (30·1%) of 1437 (OR 1·26, 95% CI 1·05-1·51); and delay of more than 4·5 h resulted in good outcome for 401 (32·6%) of 1229 versus 357 (30·6%) of 1166 (OR 1·15, 95% CI 0·95-1·40). Proportional treatment benefits were similar irrespective of age or stroke severity. Alteplase significantly increased the odds of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (type 2 parenchymal haemorrhage definition 231 [6·8%] of 3391 vs 44 [1·3%] of 3365, OR 5·55, 95% CI 4·01-7·70, p<0·0001; SITS-MOST definition 124 [3·7%] vs 19 [0·6%], OR 6·67, 95% CI 4·11-10·84, p<0·0001) and of fatal intracranial haemorrhage within 7 days (91 [2·7%] vs 13 [0·4%]; OR 7·14, 95% CI 3·98-12·79, p<0·0001). The relative increase in fatal intracranial haemorrhage from alteplase was similar irrespective of treatment delay, age, or stroke severity, but the absolute excess risk attributable to alteplase was bigger among patients who had more severe strokes. There was no excess in other early causes of death and no significant effect on later causes of death. Consequently, mortality at 90 days was 608 (17·9%) in the alteplase group versus 556 (16·5%) in the control group (hazard ratio 1·11, 95% CI 0·99-1·25, p=0·07). Taken together, therefore, despite an average absolute increased risk of early death from intracranial haemorrhage of about 2%, by 3-6 months this risk was offset by an average absolute increase in disability-free survival of about 10% for patients treated within 3·0 h and about 5% for patients treated after 3·0 h, up to 4·5 h. INTERPRETATION Irrespective of age or stroke severity, and despite an increased risk of fatal intracranial haemorrhage during the first few days after treatment, alteplase significantly improves the overall odds of a good stroke outcome when delivered within 4·5 h of stroke onset, with earlier treatment associated with bigger proportional benefits.

According to risk communication researchers, effective, transparent, and timely information sharing is the most important tool after vaccines for responding to pandemics. This study aims to start a scholarly discussion on the risk communication efforts of the World Health Organization (WHO) during the COVID-19 outbreak. We analyzed WHO's communication efforts during the first 3 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the leading international health organization, WHO was responsible for providing rapid, up-to-date, and credible information for the public and the media. The selected research items were 42 news releases and statements provided by WHO between December 31, 2019, and March 30, 2020. These were subjected to qualitative and quantitative content analyses using the NVivo 12 qualitative analysis software program for coding. The data were coded under 6 variables (date of publication, topics, frequency, wording of the COVID-19 outbreak, sourcing, and themes of the releases). While 54.7% of WHO's communications were devoted to the COVID-19 outbreak, more than half were not issued until March. That is, instead of early risk communication and clear warnings about the outbreak, WHO acted overcautiously, preferring messages related to solidarity and cooperation during the most devastating pandemic of the 21st century.","Toker, Huriye","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",https://doi.org/10.1177/00207314211024902; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34125617/,244

To date, available studies on pesticide-induced ingredient variations of herbal medicine are limited only on a few compounds and remain most others unexamined. In this study, a plant metabolomics-based strategy was performed to systematically explore the effects of two frequently used insecticides on the comprehensive constituents of Lonicerae Japonicae Flos (LJF), the flower buds of Lonicera japonica Thunb. Field trials were designed on a cultivating plot of L. japonica with controls and treatments of imidacloprid (IMI) and compound flonicamid and acetamiprid (CFA). Unbiased metabolite profiling was conducted by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer. After data pretreatment by automatic extraction and screening, a data matrix of metabolite features was submitted for statistical analyses. Consequently, 29 metabolic markers, including chlorogenic acids, iridoids and organic acid-glucosides were obtained and characterized. The relative quantitative assay was subsequently performed to monitor their variations across flowering developments. This is the first study that systematically explored the insecticide-induced metabolite variations of LJF while taking into account the inherent variability of flowering development. The results were beneficial for holistic quality assessment of LJF and significant for guiding scientific use of pesticides in the large-scale cultivation.","Pan, Hui-Qin; Zhou, Heng; Miao, Shui; Guo, De-An; Zhang, Xiao-Li; Hu, Qing; Mao, Xiu-Hong; Ji, Shen",Chinese journal of natural medicines,https://doi.org/10.1016/s1875-5364(21)60008-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33516454/,244

Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) and chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) are the two major types of mesenteric ischemia. Therapeutic approach of MI includes medical as well as surgical treatment. This review article aims to delineate the abreast knowledge on indications, management through mesenteric bypass surgical technique, and clinical outcomes. Clinical presentation of AMI and CMI varies substantially, depending on the etiology underlying it. The most common symptom of AMI is abdominal pain that is disproportionate to the outcomes of physical exams; whereas CMI normally induces postprandial abdominal pain, commonly epigastric or periumbilical, nausea and weight loss. Recent awareness of AMI management revealed that exploratory laparotomy surgical procedure with careful evaluation of bowel viability played a pivotal role in restoring intestinal oxygenation and avoiding serious complications such as peritonitis and perforation of the gangrene bowels. The management of CMI is mainly surgical, with Aorta/Iliac-SMA bypass and Aorta-Splenic bypass being the currently available options. Due to the high thrombosis levels, only patients whose surgical risk outweighs possible benefits are required for medical care as a single treatment. Furthermore, this review also postulates that aorto mesenteric revascularization procedures for chronic mesenteric ischemia are feasible, but involve careful selection of patients, and they should only be performed by vascular surgeons with extensive experience in laparoscopic vascular surgery at referral centers.","Coco, Danilo; Leanza, Silvana",Maedica,https://doi.org/10.26574/maedica.2020.15.3.381; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33312256/,244

However, with newer coated meshes, leaving the peritoneal layer open may be safe. While many studies compare methods of peritoneal flap closure, there is a deficit of literature reporting the outcomes of non-closure. METHODS A retrospective comparison of peritoneal flap closure versus non-closure during primary laparoscopic TAPP inguinal hernia repair with coated mesh was performed for all patients at Baystate Medical Center meeting inclusion criteria between January 2005 and August 2016. Primary outcome was any procedure-related adverse outcome following repair. Secondary outcomes included operative time, resolution of pre-operative pain and/or gastrointestinal symptoms, and hernia recurrence. RESULTS Of 231 patients, 55 (24%) underwent peritoneal flap closure and 176 (76%) underwent non-closure. Demographic, comorbidity, and hernia characteristics were comparable between groups with the exception of obesity (p = 0.01), current smoking status (p = 0.05) and hernia side [p = 0.04 (left), 0.0003 (right)]. Mean operative time was higher in the closure group than non-closure (98.1 ± 37.1 min vs. 76.8 ± 32.9, p < 0.0001). No cases were converted to open. Average follow-up was 21.6 ± 23.8 months. Ninety-three percent of closure patients had documented resolution of pre-operative pain versus 94.0% of non-closure (p = 0.81). The closure group experienced a higher percentage of post-operative complications, though this did not reach significance (5.5 vs. 2.3%; p = 0.36). Compared to the closure group, the non-closure groups experienced similar post-operative pain (3.6 vs. 1.2%; p = 0.24) and recurrence rate (1.8 vs. 4.0%; p = 0.68). There were no bowel obstructions, surgical site infections, unplanned readmissions, or unplanned re-operations. CONCLUSIONS Equivalent patient outcomes were seen for both procedure types post-operatively and during follow-up. Operative times were significantly shorter for non-closure patients.

Physical activity (PA) can reduce the risk of depression by 30% and is recognised as an effective treatment for mild-to-moderate depression (MMD). However, a high proportion of patients with MMD are currently inactive and the implementation of PA as an adherent treatment for MMD is not well understood. This study contributes to a growing body of research exploring how to support people who are experiencing MMD to increase their PA levels (i.e. initiation and maintenance). It investigated which factors individuals with MMD perceived to be important for integrating PA into the treatment of depression in adults. In-depth interviews were carried out with individuals with MMD (N = 6), and data were analysed using thematic analysis. Two main theories of social capital that of Bourdieu and Putnam informed the discussion of findings. The initiation and maintenance of PA were linked to individual factors including health (i.e. nature of depression; comorbidities); abilities and tastes; socioeconomic status (e.g. financial position) and positive encouragement. In addition, maintenance emerged as dependent upon the choice, enjoyment, and meaningfulness of PA itself, and, for those who engaged in group PA, on social capital. PA interventions need to be personalised. This goes beyond a simple exercise prescription based on functional ability, but instead takes into account the needs, desires and capabilities of the whole person. The nature of MMD, the wider physical and socio-economic context and the social capital that is available to the individual also need to be harnessed.","Machaczek, Katarzyna K; Allmark, Peter; Pollard, Nicholas; Goyder, Elizabeth; Shea, Mark; Horspool, Michelle; Lee, Suzanne; de-la-Haye, Stephanie; Copeland, Robert; Weich, Scott",Health & social care in the community,https://doi.org/10.1111/hsc.13283; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33440023/,244

To establish a high-throughput screening protocol for the simultaneous identification of pathogen- and host-targeted hit candidates against either pathogen or both, we have attempted co-infection of cells with IAV and RSV. However, viral replication kinetics were incompatible, RSV signal window was low, and an IAV-driven minireplicon reporter assay used in initial screens narrowed the host cell range and restricted the assay to single-cycle infections. To overcome these limitations, we developed an RSV strain carrying firefly luciferase fused to an innovative universal small-molecule assisted shut-off domain, which boosted assay signal window, and a hyperactive fusion protein that synchronized IAV and RSV reporter expression kinetics and suppressed the identification of RSV entry inhibitors sensitive to a recently reported RSV pan-resistance mechanism. Combined with a replication-competent recombinant IAV strain harboring nanoluciferase, the assay performed well on a human respiratory cell line and supports multicycle infections. Miniaturized to 384-well format, the protocol was validated through screening of a set of the National Institutes of Health Clinical Collection (NCC) in quadruplicate. These test screens demonstrated favorable assay parameters and reproducibility. Application to a LOPAC library of bioactive compounds in a proof-of-concept campaign detected licensed antimyxovirus therapeutics, ribavirin and the neuraminidase inhibitor zanamivir, and identified two unexpected RSV-specific hit candidates, Fenretinide and the opioid receptor antagonist BNTX-7.

Current methods for evaluation of antibacterial treatments in clinics and in vitro systems used in drug development and screening either do not facilitate biofilm formation or are cumbersome to operate, need large reagent volumes and are costly, limiting their usability. To address these issues, this work presents the development of a robust in vitro cell culture platform compatible with confocal microscopy. The platform shaped as a compact disc, facilitates long term bacterial culture without external pumps and tubing and can be operated for several days without additional liquid handling. As an example, Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm is grown from single cells and it is shown that: 1) the platform delivers reproducible and reliable results; 2) growth is dependent on flow rate and growth medium composition; and 3) effi-cacy of antibiotic treatment depends on the formed biofilm. This platform enables biofilm growth, quantification and treatment as in a conventional flow setup, while decreasing the application barrier of lab-on-chip systems. It provides an easy-to-use, affordable option for end users working with cell culturing in relation to e.g. diagnostics and drug screening.","Serioli, Laura; Laksafoss, Trygvi Zachariassen; Haagensen, Janus A Juul; Sternberg, Claus; Soerensen, Mads Peter; Molin, Soren; Zór, Kinga; Boisen, Anja",Analytical chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c02582; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962340/,244
126309,Apixaban compared with warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation and previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack: a subgroup analysis of the ARISTOTLE trial.,2012,"BACKGROUND Due to increased bacterial multi-drug resistance (MDR), there is an antibiotic depletion to treat infectious diseases. Consequently, other promising options have emerged, such as the antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation therapy (aPDI) based in photosensitizer (PS) compounds to produce light-activated local oxidative stress (photooxidative stress). However, there are scarce studies regarding the mode of action of PSs compound to induce photooxidative stress on pathogenic γ-proteobacteria such as MDR-Klebsiella pneumoniae. METHODOLOGY The mode of action exerted by the cationic Ir(III)-based PS (PSIR-3) to inhibit the growth of K. pneumoniae was analyzed. RT-qPCR determined the transcriptional response induced by PSIR-3 on bacteria treated with aPDI. The expression levels of genes associated with a bacterial oxidative response, such as oxyR and sodA, and the extracytoplasmic, regulators rpoE and hfq were determined. Also, were determined the transcriptional response of the extracytoplasmic factors mrkD, acrB, magA, and rmpA. RESULTS At 17 µW/cm2 photon flux and 4 µg/mL of the PSIR-3 compound, the K. pneumoniae growth was inhibited in 3 log10. Compared with untreated bacteria, the transcriptional response induced by PSIR-3 occurs via the extracytoplasmic sigma factor rpoE and hfq. In contrast, no participation in the oxyR pathway or induction of the sodA gene was observed. This response was accompanied by the upregulation of the extracytoplasmic virulence factors mrkD, magA, and rmpA. CONCLUSIONS APDI produced by PSIR-3 kills K. pneumoniae and may induce damage to the bacterial envelope that the bacterium tries to avoid by activation of extracytoplasmic factors mediated through the rpoE regulon.","Bustamante, Vanessa; González, Iván A; Dreyse, Paulina; Palavecino, Christian Erick",Photodiagnosis and photodynamic therapy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pdpdt.2020.102020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32977066/,244
127112,"Characteristic appearance of spindle cell hemangiomatosis, often misdiagnosed as venous malformation: A retrospective study of 11 cases.",2020-09-29,"INTRODUCTION The Australian Council on Healthcare Standards (ACHS) sponsored an expert-led, consensus-driven, four-stage process, based on a modified Delphi methodology, to determine a set of clinical indicators as quality measures of cancer service provision in Australia. This was done in response to requests from institutional health care providers seeking accreditation, which were additional and complementary to the existing radiation oncology set. The steering group members comprised multidisciplinary key opinion leaders and a consumer representative. Five additional participants constituted the stakeholder group, who deliberated on the final indicator set. METHODS AND RECOMMENDATIONS An initial meeting of the steering group scoped the high level nature of the desired set. In stage 2, 65 candidate indicators were identified by a literature review and a search of international metrics. These were ranked by survey, based on ease of data accessibility and collectability and clinical relevance. The top 27 candidates were debated by the stakeholder group and culled to a final set of 16 indicators. A user manual was created with indicators mapped to clinical codes. The indicator set was ratified by the Clinical Oncology Society of Australia and is now available for use by health care organisations participating in the ACHS Clinical Indicator Program. This inaugural cancer clinical indicator set covers high level assessment of various critical processes in cancer service provision in Australia. Regular reviews and updates will ensure usability. CHANGES IN MANAGEMENT AS A RESULT OF THIS STATEMENT This is the inaugural indicator set for cancer care for use across Australia and internationally under the ACHS Clinical Indicator Program. Multidisciplinary involvement through a modified Delphi process selected indicators representing both generic and specific aspects of care across the cancer journey pathway and will provide a functional tool to compare health care delivery across multiple settings. It is anticipated that this will drive continual improvement in cancer care provision.","Segelov, Eva; Carrington, Christine; Aranda, Sanchia; Currow, David; Zalcberg, John R; Heriot, Alexander G; Mileshkin, Linda; Coutsouvelis, John; Millar, Jeremy L; Collopy, Brian T; Emery, Jon D; Zhang, Phoebe; Cooper, Simon; O'Kane, Carmel; Wale, Janet; Hancock, Stephen J; Sulkowski, Anthony; Bashford, John",The Medical journal of Australia,https://doi.org/10.5694/mja2.51087; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34053081/,244
127700,Roles of endotracheal tubes and slip joints in respiratory pressure loss: a laboratory study.,2016,"""Core"" exercise is a basic part of many physical training regimens with goals ranging from rehabilitation of spine and knee injuries to improving athletic performance. Core stiffness has been proposed to perform several functions including reducing pain by minimising joint micro-movements, and enhancing strength and speed performance. This study probes the links between a training approach and immediate but temporary changes in stiffness. Passive and active stiffness was measured on 24 participants; 12 having little to no experience in core training (inexperienced), and the other 12 being athletes experienced to core training methods; before and after a 15 min bout of isometric core exercises. Passive stiffness was assessed on a ""frictionless"" bending apparatus and active stiffness assessed via a quick release mechanism. Short-term isometric core training increased passive and active stiffness in most directions for both inexperienced and experienced participants, passive left lateral bend among experienced participants being the exception (P < 0.05). There was no difference between the inexperienced and experienced groups. The results confirm that the specific isometric training exercise approach tested here can induce immediate changes in core stiffness, in this case following a single session. This may influence performance and injury resilience for a brief period.","Lee, Benjamin; McGill, Stuart",Journal of sports sciences,https://doi.org/10.1080/02640414.2016.1235791; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28282756/,244

Growing evidence shows that supplementation with carnosine, or its rate-limiting precursor β-alanine, can ameliorate aspects of the metabolic dysregulation that occurs in diabetes. There is, however, a need to develop a better understanding of the magnitude of effect and the factors associated with positive outcomes. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate the effect of carnosine or β-alanine supplementation on markers of glycaemic control and insulin resistance in humans and animals. METHODS We will perform a systematic search for randomised and non-randomised controlled trials. Studies will be retrieved by searching electronic databases, clinical trial registers, author review, and cross-referencing. Primary outcomes include changes in (i) fasting glucose, (ii) glycated haemoglobin, and (iii) 2-h glucose following a glucose tolerance test. A set of additional outcomes includes other markers of glycaemic control and insulin resistance. Risk of bias (RoB) will be assessed using the Cochrane RoB 2.0 tool (human studies) and the Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory Animal Experimentation (SYRCLE) RoB tool (animal studies). Confidence in the cumulative evidence will be assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. All meta-analyses will be conducted within a Bayesian framework, providing a flexible modelling approach to account for uncertainty in model parameters and underlying structures within the data. DISCUSSION By including all available human and animal data, we will provide the most comprehensive overview on the topic to date. The results will have implications for those working in prediabetes, diabetes, and metabolic health in general and may lead to the development of new treatment approaches. DISSEMINATION Study results will be presented at a professional conference and published in a peer-reviewed journal.

128764,Transcatheter Versus Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement in Patients With Rheumatic Aortic Stenosis.,2021-04-13,"BACKGROUND Accidental awareness during general anaesthesia (AAGA) is when a patient unintentionally becomes conscious during a procedure performed with general anaesthesia and subsequently has explicit recall of this event. Incidence estimates for AAGA vary, with the most common estimate being one to two cases per 1000 general anaesthetics. Evidence linking nitrous oxide use and an increased risk of AAGA has come from observational studies data but the literature is contradictory, with some studies finding a protective effect of nitrous oxide. OBJECTIVES To assess the effect of general anaesthesia including nitrous oxide on the risk of AAGA in patients aged five years and over. SEARCH METHODS We searched the following databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and trial registers ((www.clinicaltrials.gov), the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (www.who.int/ictrp/network/en/) and Current Controlled Trials (www.isrctn.com/)) for eligible studies on December 9 2015. In addition, we conducted forward and backward citation searching using key identified papers. SELECTION CRITERIA We considered all randomized controlled trials (RCTs), including quasi-randomized studies and cluster-randomized studies, of participants aged five years or older receiving general anaesthesia for any type of surgery.We included trials in which participants receiving general anaesthesia that included nitrous oxide for maintenance at a concentration of at least 30% were compared with participants receiving no nitrous oxide during general anaesthesia. The intervention group must have received nitrous oxide in conjunction with an additional anaesthetic. We excluded studies where the depth of anaesthesia differed between the study arms. For inclusion in the review, studies needed to state in their methods that they planned to assess AAGA. We defined this as when a patient becomes conscious during a procedure performed with general anaesthesia and subsequently has explicit recall of this event. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane to identify studies. We extracted data and conducted 'Risk of bias' assessment using the Covidence database. MAIN RESULTS We included 15 studies. The total number of participants included in the analyses was 3520. Most studies were small with fewer than 120 participants, although two larger studies with 2012 and 671 participants were included. There was considerable variation in many of the study characteristics, including the anaesthetics used. The concentrations of nitrous oxide varied between 50% and 70%, and half of the studies used clinical signs and haemodynamic changes to monitor depth of anaesthesia.As it was not possible to blind the anaesthetist to the anaesthetic used, we rated all studies at high risk of performance bias and we therefore downgraded the quality of evidence by one level for risk of bias using the GRADE approach. Other types of bias were generally low, or were rated unclear due to missing information.No studies were designed to measure AAGA as the primary outcome, and were therefore statistically underpowered to answer this review question. Despite the inclusion of 3520 participants, only three awareness events were reported by two studies. In one study the event was due to technical failure. Due to the rarity of the events, we did not consider it appropriate to pool the data, and we therefore downgraded the quality of evidence by a further level for imprecision using GRADE. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS It is not possible to draw any conclusions from this review. The included studies were mainly small (fewer than 120 participants) and there were limited estimates of effect, with only two studies reporting any events. We cannot therefore determine whether the use of nitrous oxide in general anaesthesia increases, decreases or has no effect on the risk of accidental awareness.","Hounsome, Juliet; Nicholson, Amanda; Greenhalgh, Janette; Cook, Tim M; Smith, Andrew F; Lewis, Sharon R",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd011052.pub2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27508523/,244

128959,Pilot in vivo study of an absorbable polydioxanone vena cava filter.,2015,"BACKGROUND Laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) has gained popularity in urology over the last few years. OBJECTIVE To report a large multi-institutional worldwide series of LESS in urology. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Consecutive cases of LESS done between August 2007 and November 2010 at 18 participating institutions were included in this retrospective analysis. INTERVENTION Each group performed a variety of LESS procedures according to its own protocols, entry criteria, and techniques. MEASUREMENTS Demographic data, main perioperative outcome parameters, and information related to the surgical technique were gathered and analyzed. Conversions to reduced-port laparoscopy, conventional laparoscopy, or open surgery were evaluated, as were intraoperative and postoperative complications. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS Overall, 1076 patients were included in the analysis. The most common procedures were extirpative or ablative operations in the upper urinary tract. The da Vinci robot was used to operate on 143 patients (13%). A single-port technique was most commonly used and the umbilicus represented the most common access site. Overall, operative time was 160±93 min and estimated blood loss was 148±234 ml. Skin incision length at closure was 3.5±1.5 cm. Mean hospital stay was 3.6±2.7 d with a visual analog pain score at discharge of 1.5±1.4. An additional port was used in 23% of cases. The overall conversion rate was 20.8%; 15.8% of patients were converted to reduced-port laparoscopy, 4% to conventional laparoscopy/robotic surgery, and 1% to open surgery. The intraoperative complication rate was 3.3%. Postoperative complications, mostly low grade, were encountered in 9.5% of cases. CONCLUSIONS This study provides a global view of the evolution of LESS in the field of minimally invasive urologic surgery. A broad range of procedures have been effectively performed, primarily in the academic setting, within diverse health care systems around the world. Since LESS is performed by experienced laparoscopic surgeons, the risk of complications remains low when stringent patient-selection criteria are applied.","Kaouk, Jihad H; Autorino, Riccardo; Kim, Fernando J; Han, Deok Hyun; Lee, Seung Wook; Yinghao, Sun; Cadeddu, Jeffrey A; Derweesh, Ithaar H; Richstone, Lee; Cindolo, Luca; Branco, Anibal; Greco, Francesco; Allaf, Mohamad; Sotelo, René; Liatsikos, Evangelos; Stolzenburg, Jens-Uwe; Rane, Abhay; White, Wesley M; Han, Woong Kyu; Haber, Georges-Pascal; White, Michael A; Molina, Wilson R; Jeong, Byong Chang; Lee, Joo Yong; Linhui, Wang; Best, Sara; Stroup, Sean P; Rais-Bahrami, Soroush; Schips, Luigi; Fornara, Paolo; Pierorazio, Phillip; Giedelman, Camilo; Lee, Jae Won; Stein, Robert J; Rha, Koon Ho",European urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eururo.2011.06.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21684069/,244

In the thymus, autoreactive T cells are thought to be negatively selected by reference to the self-antigens expressed in medullary epithelial cells, but the contribution of other stromal cells to tolerance induction has been poorly examined. In the present study, we report a PDGFR+ gp38+ DPP4- thymic fibroblast subset that is required for T cell tolerance induction. The deletion of the lymphotoxin β-receptor in thymic fibroblasts caused an autoimmune phenotype with decreased expression of tissue-restricted and fibroblast-specific antigens, offering insight into the long-sought target of lymphotoxin signaling in the context of the regulation of autoimmunity. Thus, thymic medullary fibroblasts play an essential role in the establishment of central tolerance by producing a diverse array of self-antigens.","Nitta, Takeshi; Tsutsumi, Masanori; Nitta, Sachiko; Muro, Ryunosuke; Suzuki, Emma C; Nakano, Kenta; Tomofuji, Yoshihiko; Sawa, Shinichiro; Okamura, Tadashi; Penninger, Josef M; Takayanagi, Hiroshi",Nature immunology,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41590-020-0756-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839611/,244

The problem is that reading the genome is very complex, requires specific knowledge, and the medical class is now unprepared. The second problem concerns the now achieved ability to modify the genome, which might be applied in the treatment of genetic diseases previously considered incurable. The techniques that can be used today are extremely delicate and expose to high risks.

In this study, we sought to compare the single-port hybrid technique, which we originally reported in 2012, with the conventional 4-port approach, in regards of complications, outcome, operative time and cost. METHODS A retrospective, single-center comparison of hybrid single-port versus conventional 4-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed in 98 consecutive pediatric patients between January 2010 and October 2014. Patient characteristics, intra- and postoperative outcomes, operative costs, and total hospitalization costs were compared between the 2 approaches using univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS The single-port technique was utilized in 56 (57%) pediatric patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The operative time for single-port procedures was shorter than that of the conventional technique (median, 85 minutes vs 114 minutes; P = .003). Patients with single-port procedures were less likely to have a cholangiogram compared to patients who underwent 4-port cholecystectomy. (9% vs 40%; P < .001). No statistically significant differences between the 2 cohorts were observed for intra- or postoperative outcomes. Although the 2 groups shared nearly the same median duration of hospitalization (22 hours vs 21 hours; P = .70), the single-port group demonstrated a lower total cost of hospitalization (median cost, $7438 vs $8783; P = .030) and lower operative cost (median, $3918 vs $4647; P < .001). CONCLUSION Hybrid single-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy in children with uncomplicated gallbladder disease is feasible and equally safe, with similar intra- and postoperative outcomes compared with the conventional 4-port approach. It can contribute to global cost reduction because of lower operative and total hospitalization costs.","Seifarth, Federico G; Liu, Michael H; Ayala, Dimaris; Worley, Sarah; Moslim, Maitham A",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.4293/jsls.2017.00031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29026282/,244

In this review, we report literature results on the possible link between outdoor PM and health outcomes with a focus on pulmonary infections and the mechanisms responsible for observed negative effects. PM physical and chemical properties, such as size and chemical composition, as well as major emission sources are described for a more comprehensive view about the role played by atmospheric PM in the observed adverse health effects; to this aim, major processes leading to the deposition of PM in the respiratory tract and how this can pave the way to the onset of pathologies are also presented. From the literature works here reviewed, two ways in which PM can threaten human health promoting respiratory infectious diseases are mostly taken into account. The first pathway is related to an enhanced susceptibility and here we will also report on molecular mechanisms in the lung immune system responsible for the augmented susceptibility to pathogens, such as the damage of mechanical defensive barriers, the alteration of the innate immune response, and the generation of oxidative stress. The second one deals with the relationship between infectious agents and PM; here we recall that viruses and bacteria (BioPM) are themselves part of atmospheric PM and are collected during sampling together with particles of different origin; so, data should be analysed with caution in order to avoid any false cause-effect relation.

Increasing COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and access has the potential to mitigate mortality and morbidity from COVID-19 for all communities, including those most impacted by the pandemic. Objective To investigate and understand factors associated with facilitating and obstructing COVID-19 vaccine access and acceptance among Black and Latinx communities. Design, Setting, and Participants This community-partnered qualitative study conducted semistructured, in-depth focus groups with Black and Latinx participants from March 17 to March 29, 2021, using a secure video conferencing platform. Participants were recruited through emails from local community-based organizations, federally qualified health centers, social service agencies, the New Haven, Connecticut, Health Department, and in-person distribution of study information from community health workers. A total of 8 focus groups were conducted, including 4 in Spanish and 4 in English, with 72 participants from a diverse range of community roles, including teachers, custodial service workers, and health care employees, in New Haven, Connecticut. Data were analyzed from March 17 to July 30, 2021. Main Outcomes and Measures Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, translated, and analyzed using an inductive content analysis approach. Themes and subthemes were identified on the acceptability and accessibility of the COVID-19 vaccine among participants who identified as Black and/or Latinx. Results Among 72 participants, 36 (50%) identified as Black, 28 (39%) as Latinx, and 8 (11%) as Black and Latinx and 56 (78%) identified as women and 16 (22%) identified as men. Participants described 3 major themes that may represent facilitators and barriers to COVID-19 vaccinations: pervasive mistreatment of Black and Latinx communities and associated distrust; informing trust via trusted messengers and messages, choice, social support, and diversity; and addressing structural barriers to vaccination access. Conclusions and Relevance The findings of this qualitative study may impact what health care systems, public health officials, policy makers, health care practitioners, and community leaders can do to facilitate equitable uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine. Community-informed insights are imperative to facilitating COVID-19 vaccine access and acceptance among communities hardest hit by the pandemic.

Currently, video capsule endoscopy and deep bowel enteroscopy are the main means for direct visualisation of the bowel surface. However, the use of optical imaging limits visualisation to the luminal surface only, which makes early-stage diagnosis difficult. In this study, we propose a learning enabled microultrasound (μUS) system that aims to classify inflamed and non-inflamed bowel tissues. μUS images of the caecum, small bowel and colon were obtained from mice treated with agents to induce inflammation. Those images were then used to train three deep learning networks and to provide a ground truth of inflammation status.

136285,Comparison of vessel sealing systems with conventional.,2013,"Actinobacteria provide a rich spectrum of bioactive natural products and therefore display an invaluable source towards commercially valuable pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Here, we studied the use of inorganic talc microparticles (hydrous magnesium silicate, 3MgO·4SiO2·H2O, 10 µm) as a general supplement to enhance natural product formation in this important class of bacteria. Added to cultures of recombinant Streptomyces lividans, talc enhanced production of the macrocyclic peptide antibiotic bottromycin A2 and its methylated derivative Met-bottromycin A2 up to 109 mg L-1 , the highest titer reported so far. Hereby, the microparticles fundamentally affected metabolism. With 10 g L-1 talc, S. lividans grew to 40% smaller pellets and, using RNA sequencing, revealed accelerated morphogenesis and aging, indicated by early upregulation of developmental regulator genes such as ssgA, ssgB, wblA, sigN and bldN. Furthermore, the microparticles re-balanced the expression of individual bottromycin cluster genes, resulting in a higher macrocyclization efficiency at the level of BotAH and correspondingly lower levels of non-cyclized shunt by-products, driving the production of mature bottromycin. Testing a variety of Streptomyces species, talc addition resulted in up to 13-fold higher titers for the RiPPs bottromycin and cinnamycin, the alkaloid undecylprodigiosin, the polyketide pamamycin, the tetracycline-type oxytetracycline, and the anthramycin-analogues usabamycins. Moreover, talc addition boosted production in other actinobacteria, outside of the genus of Streptomyces: vancomycin (Amycolatopsis japonicum DSM 44213), teicoplanin (Actinoplanes teichomyceticus ATCC 31121), and the angucyclinone-type antibiotic simocyclinone (Kitasatospora sp.). For teicoplanin, the microparticles were even crucial to activate production. Taken together, the use of talc was beneficial in 75% of all tested cases and optimized natural and heterologous hosts forming the substance of interest with clusters under native and synthetic control. Given its simplicity and broad benefits, microparticle-supplementation appears as an enabling technology in natural product research of these most important microbes.

137612,Pharmacologic and Pharmacomechanical Thrombolysis for Acute Deep Vein Thrombosis: Focus on ATTRACT CME.,2018,"BACKGROUND Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is predominantly caused by desmosomal genetic variants, and clinical hallmarks include arrhythmias and systolic dysfunction. We aimed at studying the impact of the implicated gene(s) on the disease course. METHODS The Nordic ARVC Registry holds data on a multinational cohort of ARVC families. The effects of genotype on electrocardiographic features, imaging findings and clinical events were analysed. RESULTS We evaluated 419 patients (55% men), with a mean follow-up of 11.2±7.4 years. A pathogenic desmosomal variant was identified in 62% of the 230 families: PKP2 in 41%, DSG2 in 13%, DSP in 7% and DSC2 in 3%. Reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤45% on cardiac MRI was more frequent among patients with DSC2/DSG2/DSP than PKP2 ARVC (27% vs 4%, p<0.01). In contrast, in Cox regression modelling of patients with definite ARVC, we found a higher risk of arrhythmias among PKP2 than DSC2/DSG2/DSP carriers: HR 0.25 (0.10-0.68, p<0.01) for atrial fibrillation/flutter, HR 0.67 (0.44-1.0, p=0.06) for ventricular arrhythmias and HR 0.63 (0.42-0.95, p<0.05) for any arrhythmia. Gene-negative patients had an intermediate risk (16%) of LVEF ≤45% and a risk of the combined arrhythmic endpoint comparable with DSC2/DSG2/DSP carriers. Male sex was a risk factor for both arrhythmias and reduced LVEF across all genotype groups (p<0.01). CONCLUSION In this large cohort of ARVC families with long-term follow-up, we found PKP2 genotype to be more arrhythmic than DSC2/DSG2/DSP or gene-negative carrier status, whereas reduced LVEF was mostly seen among DSC2/DSG2/DSP carriers. Male sex was associated with a more severe phenotype.","Christensen, Alex Hørby; Platonov, Pyotr G; Jensen, Henrik Kjærulf; Chivulescu, Monica; Svensson, Anneli; Dahlberg, Pia; Madsen, Trine; Frederiksen, Tanja Charlotte; Heliö, Tiina; Lie, Øyvind Haugen; Haugaa, Kristina H; Hastrup Svendsen, Jesper; Bundgaard, Henning",Journal of medical genetics,https://doi.org/10.1136/jmedgenet-2021-107911; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34400560/,244

138170,"D-dimer as a predictor of venous thromboembolism in acutely ill, hospitalized patients: a subanalysis of the randomized controlled MAGELLAN trial.",2014,"INTRODUCTION Liver hemangiomas are benign liver lesions that require surgical excision when large and symptomatic. Often, these tumors are removed through large anatomical resections which sacrifice more liver parenchyma than needed. Tumor enucleation, which takes advantage of a digitoclasia-like technique along the plane between the tumor pseudo-capsule and liver parenchyma, poses challenges when performed laparoscopically. We propose a parenchymal sparing, minimally invasive, robotic-assisted technique to remove liver hemangiomas. PRESENTATION OF CASES Three male patients with symptomatic hemangiomas were treated in our center between 2015 and 2018. The lesions were located in segment II, III and segment IV-V respectively. Robotic-assisted hemangioma enucleation was accomplished successfully in all three patients. The procedures were performed with a parenchyma-sparing intent and a formal segmentectomy was not required. There were no conversions to open surgery. DISCUSSION The robotic platform provides a powerful tool in the enucleation of liver hemangiomas. The enhanced vision and the superior suturing ability allow to develop safely the plane between the tumor pseudo-capsule and the liver parenchyma, with outstanding selective control of all the vascular supply and drainage encountered during the dissection. Furthermore, precision of the hilar dissection allows selective lobar or sectorial arterial control which helps minimize intraoperative bleeding. CONCLUSION In our experience, robot-assisted enucleation of liver hemangiomas offers low morbidity, fast recovery, excellent cosmetic results, and it could become a therapeutic option when the location of the hemangioma allows this approach.","Giulianotti, Pier Cristoforo; Bustos, Roberto; Valle, Valentina; Aguiluz, Gabriela; Pavelko, Yevhen; Fernandes, Eduardo",International journal of surgery case reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2019.06.033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31255934/,244
138576,About syncopal recurrences in Biosync trial.,2021-06-21,"BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to investigate outcomes in the treatment of bilateral inguinal hernia, comparing the laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal (TEP) and open tension-free mesh repair (LICHT) approaches. METHODS We performed a prospective controlled non randomized clinical study in 128 patients with bilateral inguinal hernia over a period of 3 years. LICHT was used in 106 cases (53 patients) while TEP was employed in 150 cases (75 patients). The main outcome measurements were: recurrence rate, operating time, hospital stay and postoperative complications. RESULTS There were three recurrences (2.3%): two in the LICHT group (3.8%) and one (1.3%) in the TEP group P = NS. The TEP procedure was faster than LICHT repair (48.8 ± 10.8 vs. 70.4 ± 11.2 min) P < 0.01. Postoperative complications were more frequent in LICHT group (16%) than TEP group (5.3%) P < 0.01. Hospital stay was significantly shorter in the TEP group (0.6 ± 0.8 vs. 1.3 ± 1.2 days) P < 0.001.

It provides training of full procedures with simulation of bleeding. Although widely used, the face validity has not yet been evaluated. This study aimed to establish face validity of the POP trainer for laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) and its usefulness compared with other training modalities. MATERIALS AND METHODS During MIS courses, the participants (n = 52) used the POP trainer to perform LC. Face validity was assessed with questionnaires for realism and usefulness on a five-point Likert scale. Participants were divided into two groups: experts (n = 15) who had performed more than 50 laparoscopic procedures and novices (n = 37) with less than 50 procedures. Secondary aims included the ranking of training modalities, as well as exploration of their specific advantages and disadvantages. RESULTS The POP trainer was found to be realistic (3.8 ± 0.9) and useful (4.6 ± 0.9). Differences between experts and novices were only found for ""The training modality resembles reality"" (3.1 ± 0.8 vs. 3.8 ± 0.7; p = 0.010), ""The operation on the POP trainer is realistic"" (3.4 ± 1.1 vs. 4.5 ± 0.8; p = 0.003), and ""It would be desirable to have a POP trainer at my own hospital"" (4.2 ± 1.1 vs. 4.8 ± 0.8; p = 0.040). In the ranking, the animal training (1.1 ± 0.3) placed first, the POP trainer (2.3 ± 0.9) second, and the VR trainer (2.8 ± 0.9) and box trainer (2.8 ± 1.1) third. The realistic simulation of animal training was named as an advantage most often, while the unrealistic simulation of the VR trainer was the most often named disadvantage. CONCLUSIONS The POP trainer was rated a highly realistic and useful training modality with face validity for LC. Differences between experts and novices existed concerning realism and desirability. Future studies should evaluate the POP trainer for more advanced surgical procedures. The POP trainer widens the spectrum of modalities for training of MIS in a safe environment outside the operating room.","Nickel, Felix; Kowalewski, Karl-Friedrich; Rehberger, Florian; Hendrie, Jonathan David; Mayer, Benjamin Friedrich Berthold; Kenngott, Hannes Götz; Bintintan, Vasile; Linke, Georg Richard; Fischer, Lars; Müller-Stich, Beat Peter",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-016-5025-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27317031/,244

This includes the use of phage display technology to select antigens, the use of engineered phages displaying target antigens in vaccine formulations, and phage DNA vaccines. However, the development of these approaches is limited in part by uncertainty regarding the underlying mechanisms by which phages elicit immunity. This has stymied the clinical development of this technology. Here we review the immunology of phage vaccines and highlight the gaps in our knowledge regarding the underlying mechanisms. First, we review the basic biology of phages and their use in vaccines. Next we discuss what is known about the mechanisms of immunity against engineered phages and phage DNA. Finally, we highlight the gaps in our understanding regarding the immunogenicity of these preparations. We argue that mechanistic insight into the immunology of phage vaccines is essential for the further development and clinical utility of these technologies.","de Vries, Christiaan R; Chen, Quingquan; Demirdjian, Sally; Kaber, Gernot; Khosravi, Arya; Liu, Dan; Van Belleghem, Jonas D; Bollyky, Paul L",Current opinion in biotechnology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.copbio.2020.11.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33316575/,244

141082,The association between psychosocial interventions and fertility treatment outcome: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,2021-02-19,"Arteriviruses are enveloped positive-strand RNA viruses for which the attachment proteins and cellular receptors have remained largely controversial. Arterivirus particles contain at least eight envelope proteins, an unusually large number among RNA viruses. These appear to segregate into three groups: major structural components (major glycoprotein GP5 and membrane protein [M]), minor glycoproteins (GP2a, GP3, and GP4), and small hydrophobic proteins (E and the recently discovered ORF5a protein). Biochemical studies previously suggested that the GP5-M heterodimer of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) interacts with porcine sialoadhesin (pSn) in porcine alveolar macrophages (PAM). However, another study proposed that minor protein GP4, along with GP2a, interacts with CD163, another reported cellular receptor for PRRSV. In this study, we provide genetic evidence that the minor envelope proteins are the major determinant of arterivirus entry into cultured cells. A PRRSV infectious cDNA clone was equipped with open reading frames (ORFs) encoding minor envelope and E proteins of equine arteritis virus (EAV), the only known arterivirus displaying a broad tropism in cultured cells. Although PRRSV and EAV are only distantly related and utilize diversified transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs), a viable chimeric progeny virus was rescued. Strikingly, this chimeric virus (vAPRRS-EAV2ab34) acquired the broad in vitro cell tropism of EAV, demonstrating that the minor envelope proteins play a critical role as viral attachment proteins. We believe that chimeric arteriviruses of this kind will be a powerful tool for further dissection of the arterivirus replicative cycle, including virus entry, subgenomic RNA synthesis, and virion assembly.","Tian, Debin; Wei, Zuzhang; Zevenhoven-Dobbe, Jessika C; Liu, Runxia; Tong, Guangzhi; Snijder, Eric J; Yuan, Shishan",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.06836-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22258262/,244

OBJECTIVE To introduce and integrate the use of Bispectral Index (BIS) monitoring as adjunct to sedation scale assessment in intubated mechanically ventilated Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) patients. METHODS Quality improvement intervention including: BIS education for all PICU nurses; 8-week implementation of BIS monitoring guided by Paediatric BIS Sedation Protocol; evaluation by convenience sample of nurses (n=17). MEASUREMENTS 15-Item survey assessing perceptions of BIS attributes was given to nurses after first 4 BIS encounters; nurse comments and project coordinator observations were recorded. FINDINGS Survey data (intermediate reliability and nurse attitude ratings and low ratings on other attributes; little change over time) revealed nurses' reservations about the usefulness of BIS as an adjunct to sedation scales, but qualitative data indicated that they valued BIS for assessing sedation depth in children receiving NMBAs. CONCLUSIONS Post-intervention, BIS monitoring was adopted in PICU for children receiving NMBAs. One year later, this practice is sustained, and the percentage of BIS-monitored patients has increased. Guidelines addressing the use of BIS in patients not receiving paralytics are needed.","Hawks, Sharon J; Brandon, Debra; Uhl, Tammy",Intensive & critical care nursing,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.iccn.2012.04.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22889879/,244

Objective To investigate the effect of a single high dose of vitamin D3 on hospital length of stay in patients with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants This was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 2 sites in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The study included 240 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who were moderately to severely ill at the time of enrollment from June 2, 2020, to August 27, 2020. The final follow-up was on October 7, 2020. Interventions Patients were randomly assigned to receive a single oral dose of 200 000 IU of vitamin D3 (n = 120) or placebo (n = 120). Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was length of stay, defined as the time from the date of randomization to hospital discharge. Prespecified secondary outcomes included mortality during hospitalization; the number of patients admitted to the intensive care unit; the number of patients who required mechanical ventilation and the duration of mechanical ventilation; and serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, total calcium, creatinine, and C-reactive protein. Results Of 240 randomized patients, 237 were included in the primary analysis (mean [SD] age, 56.2 [14.4] years; 104 [43.9%] women; mean [SD] baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D level, 20.9 [9.2] ng/mL). Median (interquartile range) length of stay was not significantly different between the vitamin D3 (7.0 [4.0-10.0] days) and placebo groups (7.0 [5.0-13.0] days) (log-rank P = .59; unadjusted hazard ratio for hospital discharge, 1.07 [95% CI, 0.82-1.39]; P = .62). The difference between the vitamin D3 group and the placebo group was not significant for in-hospital mortality (7.6% vs 5.1%; difference, 2.5% [95% CI, -4.1% to 9.2%]; P = .43), admission to the intensive care unit (16.0% vs 21.2%; difference, -5.2% [95% CI, -15.1% to 4.7%]; P = .30), or need for mechanical ventilation (7.6% vs 14.4%; difference, -6.8% [95% CI, -15.1% to 1.2%]; P = .09). Mean serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D significantly increased after a single dose of vitamin D3 vs placebo (44.4 ng/mL vs 19.8 ng/mL; difference, 24.1 ng/mL [95% CI, 19.5-28.7]; P < .001). There were no adverse events, but an episode of vomiting was associated with the intervention. Conclusions and Relevance Among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, a single high dose of vitamin D3, compared with placebo, did not significantly reduce hospital length of stay.

After a first development in Wuhan, China, the virus spread in other countries, with Italy registering the second highest number of cases in Europe on the 7th of April 2020 (135,586 in total). The World Health Organization declared the pandemic diffusion of COVID-19, and restrictive measures to limit contagion have been taken in several countries. The virus has a predominantly respiratory transmission through aerosol and droplets. The importance of infection control is therefore crucial in limiting the effects of virus diffusion. We aim to discuss the risks related to dental practice and current recommendations for dental practitioners. A literature search was performed to retrieve articles on the management of COVID-19 diffusion in dental practice. The documented clinical experience, the measures of professional prevention, and the actual Italian situation were reported and described. Four articles were retrieved from the literature search. Among the eligible articles, 3 reported measures to contrast COVID-19 diffusion. The infection management protocols suggested were reviewed. Finally, recommendations based on the Italian experience in terms of patient triage, patients' entrance into the practice, dental treatment, and after-treatment management are reported and discussed.

A patient-tailored program was developed to assess its efficacy regarding prevention of COVID-19 infection among patients with breast cancer undergoing surgery and healthcare workers (HCWs). PATIENTS AND METHODS From March 9th to April 9th 2020, 91 patients were selected for elective surgery by means of: i) Pre-hospital screening aimed at avoiding hospitalization of symptomatic or suspicious COVID-19 patients, and ii) prioritisation of surgical procedure according to specific disease features. RESULTS Eighty-five patients (93.4%) were fit for surgery, while five patients (5.5%) were temporarily excluded through 'telephone triage'; another two patients were excluded at in-hospital triage. A total of 71 out of 85 patients (83.5%) were diagnosed with invasive cancer, most of whom were undergoing breast-conserving surgery (61 out of 85 patients, 71.8%). The mean in-hospital stay was 2.2 days (SD=0.7 days). After hospital discharge, no patient needed re-admission due to post-operative complications; moreover, no COVID-19 infection among patients or HCWs was detected. CONCLUSION Safe breast cancer surgery was accomplished for both patients and HCWs by means of a careful preoperative selection of patients and in-hospital preventative measures.

143017,Brugada syndrome and reduced right ventricular outflow tract conduction reserve: a final common pathway?,2021-01-09,"INTRODUCTION Vocal fold atrophy and scar can lead to loss of normal superficial lamina propria, negatively affecting the vibratory function of the vocal fold. These changes can lead to dysphonia, vocal fatigue, decreased volume, and altered pitch. Treatment options for these conditions are limited. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) consists of platelets, growth factors, and cytokines derived from the patient's own blood and is believed to activate tissue regeneration. The purpose of this study was to review the technical aspects of collecting PRP and injecting it into the vocal fold injection - based on our initial experience with this procedure. CASE A patient with vocal fold scar was identified and enrolled in an ongoing prospective clinical trial study of a series of 4 monthly subepithelial vocal fold PRP injections, which was temporarily halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Patient underwent a single injection of autologous PRP into the left vocal fold. There were no adverse events during the study period. Subjective improvement in voice was noted at 1 month after injection with subsequent return to baseline over the next 4 months. Videostroboscopy performed on postinjection day 1 and day 7 and demonstrated no concerning exam changes. Compared to the preinjection baseline, the patient-reported voice-handicap index-10 (VHI-10) and voice catastrophization index were similar at 4 months following injection (20 to 20 and 4 to 3, respectively). Independent perceptual analysis of voice showed improvement at 4 months postinjection, compared to baseline consensus auditory-perceptual evaluation of voice 60 to 44.

Seven hundred sixty-one (93.4%) were treated with a combination of oral antivirals (lopinavir/ritonavir and chloroquine) with intramuscular administration of IFN-α2b (Heberon® Alpha R, Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Havana, Cuba), 3 times per week, for 2 weeks. Fifty-three patients received the approved COVID protocol without IFN treatment. The proportion of patients discharged from hospital (without clinical and radiological symptoms and nondetectable virus by real-time polymerase chain reaction) was higher in the IFN-treated compared with the non-IFN treated group (95.4% vs. 26.1%, P < 0.01). The case fatality rate (CFR) for all patients was 2.95%, and for those patients who received IFN-α2b the CFR was reduced to 0.92. Intensive care was required for 82 patients (10.1%), 42 (5.5%) had been treated with IFN.

144232,Pulse oximetry saturation patterns detect repetitive reductions in airflow.,2011,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently transitioned from ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) surveillance to ventilator-associated event (VAE) surveillance in adult inpatient settings. Since the transition, several modifications have been made to improve surveillance methods, and there is a growing body of data regarding the epidemiology, risk factors, and preventability of VAEs. RECENT FINDINGS The VAE surveillance definition algorithm is based on objective criteria and includes three tiers: ventilator-associated conditions, infection-related ventilator-associated complications, and possible and probable VAP. VAE surveillance expands the purview of surveillance beyond pneumonia alone to include additional complications of mechanical ventilation. Most VAEs are caused by pneumonia, pulmonary edema, atelectasis, or acute respiratory distress syndrome. VAEs are associated with adverse outcomes including prolonged mechanical ventilation, longer intensive care and hospital length-of-stay, and higher mortality rates.

Materials and Methods In this Institutional Review Board-approved prospective study, 68 patients with 88 hepatocellulcar carcinomas (HCCs) who had undergone pre-RFA MRI were enrolled. Informed consent was obtained from all patients. Pre-RFA MRI and post-RFA CT images were analyzed to evaluate the presence of a sufficient safety margin (≥ 3 mm) in two separate sessions using either side-by-side visual comparison or non-rigid registration software. Patients with an insufficient ablative margin on either one or both methods underwent additional treatment depending on the technical feasibility and patient's condition. Then, ablative margins were re-assessed using both methods. Local tumor progression (LTP) rates were compared between the sufficient and insufficient margin groups in each method. Results The two methods showed 14.8% (13/88) discordance in estimating sufficient ablative margins. On registration software-assisted inspection, patients with insufficient ablative margins showed a significantly higher 5-year LTP rate than those with sufficient ablative margins (66.7% vs. 27.0%, p = 0.004). However, classification by visual inspection alone did not reveal a significant difference in 5-year LTP between the two groups (28.6% vs. 30.5%, p = 0.79). Conclusion Registration software provided better ablative margin assessment than did visual inspection in patients with HCCs who had undergone pre-RFA MRI and post-RFA CT for prediction of LTP after RFA and may provide more precise risk stratification of those who are treated with RFA.","Yoon, Jeong Hee; Lee, Jeong Min; Klotz, Ernst; Woo, Hyunsik; Yu, Mi Hye; Joo, Ijin; Lee, Eun Sun; Han, Joon Koo",Korean journal of radiology,https://doi.org/10.3348/kjr.2018.19.6.1053; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30386137/,244

This study aimed to investigate how emergency physicians choose chest tube size and whether chest tube size affects patient outcome. We reviewed medical charts of patients who underwent chest tube insertion for chest trauma within 24 hours of admission in this retrospective, single-institution study. Patient characteristics, inserted tube size, risk of additional tube, and complications were evaluated. Eighty-six chest tubes were placed in 64 patients. Sixty-seven tubes were placed initially, and 19 additionally, which was significantly smaller than the initial tube. Initial tube size was 28 Fr in 38 and <28 Fr in 28 patients. Indications were pneumothorax (n=24), hemothorax (n=7), and hemopneumothorax (n=36). Initial tube size was not related to sex, BMI, BSA, indication, ISS, RTS, chest AIS, or respiratory status. An additional tube was placed in the same thoracic cavity for residual pneumothorax (n=13), hemothorax (n=1), hemopneumothorax (n=1), and inappropriate extrapleural placement (n=3). Risk of additional tube placement was not significantly different depending on tube size. No additional tube was placed for tube occlusion or surgical intervention for residual clotted hemothorax. Emergency physicians did not choose tube size depending on patient sex, body size, or situation. Even with a <28 Fr tube placed in chest trauma patients, the risk of residual hemo/pneumothorax and tube occlusion did not increase, and drainage was effective.","Terada, Takafumi; Nishimura, Tetsuro; Uchida, Kenichiro; Hagawa, Naohiro; Esaki, Maiko; Mizobata, Yasumitsu",Nagoya journal of medical science,https://doi.org/10.18999/nagjms.82.1.59; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32273633/,244

At the moment there is not an available vaccine, so, scientific community is looking for strategies and drugs to implement prevention and prophylaxis. Several compounds are examined for this purpose. Glycyrrhizin, an alkaloid extracted from licorice plant (glycyrriza glabra), is one of the most studied molecules, both for its peculiar biological functions and for its pharmacological effects. This brief review aims to highlight the characteristics of glycyrrhizin for topical use on the nasal and ocular surfaces. The anti-inflammatory activity, the ability to inhibit the accumulation of ROS, the antiviral property, but, above all, the ability to bind the ACE receptor and the SARS - CoV-2 protein S in the extracellular environment make Glycyrrhizzin for topical use a compound with a high prophylactic potential for SARS - CoV - 2 infection, also due to its low cost and the absence of significant side effects.","Passali, D; Ciprandi, G; Damiani, V; De Marco, A M; Cianfrone, F; Passali, F M",Journal of biological regulators and homeostatic agents,https://doi.org/10.23812/21-1supp2-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33982533/,244

We investigated M2698, an oral p70S6K/AKT dual inhibitor, in patients with advanced cancer who failed standard therapies. METHODS M2698 was administered as monotherapy (escalation, 15-380 mg daily; food effect cohort, 240-320 mg daily) and combined with trastuzumab or tamoxifen. RESULTS Overall, 101 patients were treated (M2698, n = 62; M2698/trastuzumab, n = 13; M2698/tamoxifen, n = 26). Patients were predominantly aged < 65 years, were female, had performance status 1 and were heavily pretreated. There was a dose- and concentration-dependent inhibition of pS6 levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and tumor tissue. M2698 was well tolerated; the most common treatment-emergent adverse events were gastrointestinal, abnormal dreams and fatigue (serious, attributed to M2698: monotherapy, 8.1%; M2698/trastuzumab, 7.7%; M2698/tamoxifen, 11.5% of patients). The recommended phase 2 doses of M2698 were 240 mg QD (monotherapy), 160 mg QD (M2698/trastuzumab) and 160 mg QD/240 mg intermittent regimen (M2698/tamoxifen). In the monotherapy cohort, 27.4% of patients had stable disease at 12 weeks; no objective response was noted. The median progression-free survival (PFS) durations in patients with PAM pathway alterations with and without confounding markers (KRAS, EGFR, AKT2) were 1.4 months and 2.8 months, respectively. Two patients with breast cancer (M2698/trastuzumab, n = 1; M2698/tamoxifen, n = 1) had partial response; their PFS durations were 31 months and 2.7 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS M2698 was well tolerated. Combined with trastuzumab or tamoxifen, M2698 demonstrated antitumor activity in patients with advanced breast cancer resistant to multiple standard therapies, suggesting that it could overcome treatment resistance.

In the last decade, increased interest has been shown in its usage via the oesophagus for sampling lesions inaccessible via the airways. We describe three cases in which we used this modality to biopsy lesions not visualised via conventional EBUS and which would be too risky to be attempted via a CT-guided biopsy with a high likelihood of complications. More focused education on using EBUS via the oesophagus for respiratory trainees could greatly improve overall clinical practice. It improves the diagnostic yield of lesions and prevents subsequent referral to gastrointestinal colleagues which may delay diagnosis especially during the COVID-19 pandemic as was the case in our patient cohort where services are already limited. EBUS, due to its smaller size, is less irritant to the upper airways and requires less sedation than endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) scopes. It is also shorter than an EUS scope improving manoeuvrability.

BACKGROUND Percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation (PPVI) is the standard of care for managing patients with dysfunctional right ventricular outflow tract, and the approach is standardized. METHODS Patients undergoing PPVI using the one-step procedure were identified in our database. Procedural data and radiation exposure were compared to those in a matched group of patients who underwent PPVI using the conventional two-step procedure. RESULTS Between January 2016 and January 2017, PPVI was performed in 27 patients (median age/range, 19.1/10-55 years) using the one-step procedure involving manual crimping of one to three bare metal stents over the Melody valve. The stent and Melody valve were delivered successfully using the Ensemble delivery system. No complications occurred. All patients had excellent hemodynamic results (median/range post-PPVI right ventricular to pulmonary artery gradient, 9/0-20 mmHg). Valve function was excellent. Median procedural and fluoroscopic times were 56 and 10.2 min, respectively, which significantly differed from those of the two-step procedure group. Similarly, the dose area product (DAP), and radiation time were statistically lower in the one-step group than in the two-step group (P < 0.001 for all variables). After a median follow-up of 8 months (range, 3-14.7), no patient underwent reintervention, and no device dysfunction was observed. CONCLUSIONS The one-step procedure is a safe modification that allows interventionists to prestent and implants the Melody valve simultaneously. It significantly reduces procedural and fluoroscopic times, and radiation exposure.","Boudjemline, Younes",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.27332; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28944581/,244

Current theory suggests that simultaneous occlusion of more than 60% of AVM volume induces significant redistribution local blood flow. That, in turn, may lead to hemorrhage due to AVM rupture. Aside from angiographic findings, there is still no method that predicts the degree of safe partial embolization. Intraluminal measurement of flow velocity and pressure in the vicinity of the AVM nidus might allow detecting the changes in local hemodynamics. That can provide a valuable data and shed the light on the origin of vascular catastrophes. Ten patients underwent 12 embolization sessions with intraluminal flow velocity and pressure monitoring. The measurements were performed by dual-sensor guidewire. The ""Combomap"" (Volcano) system with Combowire microguidewires was chosen for measurements, as there is a documented experience of safe use of said guidewires in the cerebral vasculature. The findings observed during the study matched empirical data as well as the current physiological hypothesis of AVM hemorrhage.

First, we investigate the velocity distribution and the temperature-kinetic energy relationship associated with the isokinetic Nosé-Hoover family of methods, showing how they depend on the number of thermostats attached to each atomic degree of freedom. Second, we investigate the performance of these methods in the calculation of solvation free energies, the determination of which is often key for understanding the partition of a chemical species among distinct environments. We show how one can extract this property from canonical (constant-NVT) simulations and compare the result to experimental data obtained at a specific pressure. Finally, we demonstrate that large time steps can, in fact, be used to improve the efficiency of these calculations and that attaching multiple thermostats per degree of freedom is beneficial for effectively exploring the configurational space of a molecular system.","Abreu, Charlles R A; Tuckerman, Mark E",Journal of chemical theory and computation,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.0c00698; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33197180/,244

Physiological substances (neurotransmitters, hormones, etc.) in the body fluctuate significantly before and after sexual maturation. Therefore, the effect of chemical exposure on the central nervous system often differs depending on the developmental stage and sex. We aimed to compare the behavioural effects that emerged from the administration of chemicals to mice of different life stages (immature or mature) and different sex (male or female). We administered mice with domoic acid (DA), a marine poison, and ibotenic acid (IA), found in poisonous mushrooms. These excitatory amino acids act as agonists for glutamate and are potent neurotoxins. Interestingly, the behavioural effects of these chemicals were completely different. Following DA administration, we observed memory deficits only in groups of male mice treated at maturity. Following IA administration, we observed deviations in emotional behaviour in groups of male mice treated at both immaturity and maturity. In contrast, few characteristic changes were detected in all groups of females. Our results support the theory that the behavioural effects of chemical administration vary considerably with developmental stages and sex.

However, designing a QD-based optoelectronic device requires specialized approaches compared with designing conventional bulk-based solar cells. In this paper, design considerations for QD thin-film solar cells are introduced from two different viewpoints: optics and electrics. The confined energy level of QDs contributes to the adjustment of their band alignment, enabling their absorption characteristics to be adapted to a specific device purpose. However, the materials selected for this energy adjustment can increase the light loss induced by interface reflection. Thus, management of the light path is important for optical QD solar cell design, whereas surface modification is a crucial issue for the electrical design of QD solar cells. QD thin-film solar cell architectures are fabricated as a heterojunction today, and ligand exchange provides suitable doping states and enhanced carrier transfer for the junction. Lastly, the stability issues and methods on QD thin-film solar cells are surveyed.

DESIGN A population-based cohort study. METHOD Two waves of panel data in 2014 and 2016 from the China Family Panel Study were used. A total of 8025 urban adults were identified. The Hausman-Taylor model was used to analyse the theoretical relationship between smoking and income. RESULTS The percentage of current smokers decreased from 27.39% (2014) to 26.24% (2016), while the percentage of former smokers rose from 9.78% to 11.78%. The results from the Hausman-Taylor model showed that current smokers and former smokers are associated with statistically significant decrease in the income of urban residents of 37.70% and 44.00%, respectively, compared with that of non-smokers. After eliminating the impact of smoking on income, the poverty rate among urban residents decreased from 15.33% to 13.63%. CONCLUSIONS Smoking can significantly reduce the income of Chinese urban residents, resulting in immense negative impacts on Chinese society. Therefore, the government should raise the tax rate on tobacco, include smoking cessation treatment in medical insurance coverage, promote publicity campaigns on the awareness of tobacco hazards and encourage smokers to quit smoking early.","Wei, Han; Zhong, Zhigang; Yang, Lian; Yao, Tingting; Huang, Shiyao; Mao, Zhengzhong",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-036939; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830114/,244

Undergraduate pharmacy students in years one to three of two four-year entry-to-practice programs at a university in Canada were administered open-book examinations to complete their didactic winter-term courses in pharmaceutical sciences; behavioural, social, and administrative sciences; and pharmacotherapeutics. The impacts of the switch to open-book examinations on final exam characteristics are examined. METHODS The ratios and correlations of final exam and midterm grades in 2020, where final exams were open-book, and in 2019, where finals were closed-book, were calculated and compared. RESULTS In 2020, the ratio of final exam to midterm exam scores for five out of seven courses were significantly larger than they were in 2019. Alternatively, for all but one course, the correlations between midterm and final examination grades showed no significant difference from 2019 to 2020. CONCLUSIONS Compared to 2019 when finals were administered in a closed-book format, a sudden shift to an open-book format for final exams in 2020 appears to be associated with the final exams becoming easier relative to midterms. However, when considering how final and midterm exam grades correlate year over year, in all but one class, there was no significant difference. These findings suggest that changing exams to be open-book may change how they can be used to inform criterion-referenced or absolute grading decisions but not norm-referenced or rank-based decisions.","Cor, M Ken; Brocks, Dion R",Currents in pharmacy teaching & learning,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cptl.2021.06.039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34330396/,244

The prevalence of hypercoagulable state in these patients is unknown, but appears to be higher compared to those with other critically ill patients. Elevated D-dimer, large blood vessels clots, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and disseminated intravascular coagulation have been reported in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 either on admission or during hospitalization and may be predictors of poor outcomes. METHODS We performed a comprehensive literature review using the search terms of COVID-19; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, coagulopathy, thrombosis and anticoagulation in PubMed, Ovid, google scholar, Medline and EMBASE databases from December 2019 to May 30, 2020. RESULTS A total of 64 relevant studies were reviewed; of which, 4 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included for analysis. The majority of the studies were retrospective involving 525 critically ill COVID-19 patients. The most commonly studied anticoagulant administered was low molecular weight heparins. Anticoagulation dosing varied throughout the studies and may be classified as standard venous thromboembolism prophylaxis, intermediate dosing, or full dose anticoagulation. The most studied objective was improvement in coagulopathy. Significant reduction in D-dimer, improvement in coagulopathy markers such as Interlukin-6, fibrinogen degradation product level, as well as lymphocyte count were reported. CONCLUSION Despite the limited quality of studies analyzed, prophylaxis and higher intensity dosed anticoagulation is associated with improved pulmonary oxygenation, decreased coagulopathy markers and decreased mortality in COVID-19 patients.","Lazaridis, Dovena; Leung, Simon; Kohler, Lisa; Smith, Carla Hawkins; Kearson, Margaretta L; Eraikhuemen, Nathaniel",Journal of pharmacy practice,https://doi.org/10.1177/08971900211015055; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33960219/,244

Providing PHC services to all inhabitants is one of the Chinese government's health care objectives. However, an imbalance between people's increasing health needs and effective health service utilization exists in China. The objective of this review is to identify evidence for PHC development in China and to summarize the challenges as a reference for the future improvement of China's PHC system. Literature searches related to China's PHC were performed in PubMed, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wan-fang databases. Related data were collected from the China Statistical Yearbook on Health and Family Planning 2003-2016, the China National Health Accounts Report 2015, and An Analysis Report of National Health Services Survey in China, 2013. The PHC network and the population's health have improved in China in recent years, with general practitioners as ""gatekeepers"" who have gradually taken the initiative to offer health services to residents. The limitation of input and shortages of resources and skilled health care providers may restrict the sustainable development of China's PHC system. Therefore, policy support from the government is necessary.","Li, Huazhang; Liu, Kun; Gu, Jianjun; Zhang, Yimin; Qiao, Yun; Sun, Xiaoming",The International journal of health planning and management,https://doi.org/10.1002/hpm.2435; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28670754/,244

To date, electrophysiological measures of the efficiency of monophasic tPCS have not been reported. Therefore, we explored the effects of monophasic anodal and cathodal-tPCS (a-tPCS/c-tPCS) at theta (4 Hz) and gamma (75 Hz) frequencies on theta and high gamma electroencephalography (EEG) oscillatory power. In a single-blind randomized sham-controlled cross-over design, 15 healthy participants were randomly assigned into five experimental sessions in which they received a-PCS/c-tPCS at 4 and 75 Hz or sham stimulation over the left primary motor cortex (M1) for 15 min at an intensity of 1.5 mA. Changes in theta and high gamma oscillatory power were recorded at baseline, immediately after, and 30 minutes after stimulation using EEG at rest with eyes open. A-tPCS at 4 Hz showed a significant increase in theta power compared to sham, whereas c-tPCS at 4 Hz had no significant effect on theta power. A-tPCS at 75 Hz produced no changes in high gamma power compared to sham. Importantly, c-tPCS at 75 Hz led to a significant reduction in high gamma power compared to baseline, as well as compared to c-tPCS at 4 Hz and sham stimulation. The results demonstrate the modulation of oscillatory brain activity by monophasic tPCS, and highlight the need for future studies on a larger scale to confirm these initial findings.","Dissanayaka, Thusharika; Zoghi, Maryam; Hill, Aron; Farrell, Michael; Egan, Gary; Jaberzadeh, Shapour",Brain connectivity,https://doi.org/10.1089/brain.2020.0756; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962422/,244

Here we report a rapid and sensitive detection of R. solanacearum using an isothermal method for copying DNA known as loop-mediated amplification (LAMP). A set of four primers was designed to replicate the gene coding for the flagellar subunit, fliC, and conditions for detection were optimized to complete in 60 min at 65 degrees C. Magnesium pyrophosphate resulting from the amplification reaction could be detected optically as an increase in the solution turbidity, and the DNA products spread in a reproducible ladder-like banding pattern after electrophoresis in an agarose gel. Replication of the fliC gene was detected only from R. solanacearum. The detection limit of this LAMP assay was between 10(4) to 10(6) colony forming units/ml, and the technique may be useful for developing rapid and sensitive detection methods for the R. solanacearum pathogen in soil and water.","Kubota, R; Vine, B G; Alvarez, A M; Jenkins, D M",Phytopathology,https://doi.org/10.1094/phyto-98-9-1045; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18943743/,244

This epidemiological pattern has occurred numerous times during the last 70 years, including epidemics of dengue virus and West Nile virus, and the most recent explosive epidemic of Zika virus in the Americas. Flaviviruses are now globally distributed and infect up to 400 million people annually. Of significant concern, outbreaks of other less well-characterized flaviviruses have been reported in humans and animals in different regions of the world. The potential for these viruses to sustain epidemic transmission among humans is poorly understood. In this Review, we discuss the basic biology of flaviviruses, their infectious cycles, the diseases they cause and underlying host immune responses to infection. We describe flaviviruses that represent an established ongoing threat to global health and those that have recently emerged in new populations to cause significant disease. We also provide examples of lesser-known flaviviruses that circulate in restricted areas of the world but have the potential to emerge more broadly in human populations. Finally, we discuss how an understanding of the epidemiology, biology, structure and immunity of flaviviruses can inform the rapid development of countermeasures to treat or prevent human infections as they emerge.","Pierson, Theodore C; Diamond, Michael S",Nature microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-020-0714-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32367055/,244
157030,The PROFID project.,2020-09-19,"BACKGROUND Licensed ranibizumab (0.5 mg/0.05 ml Lucentis®; Novartis International AG, Basel, Switzerland) and aflibercept (2 mg/0.05 ml Eylea®; Bayer AG, Leverkusen, Germany) and unlicensed bevacizumab (1.25 mg/0.05 ml Avastin®; F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG, Basel, Switzerland) are used to treat macula oedema due to central retinal vein occlusion, but their relative clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and impact on the UK NHS and Personal Social Services have never been directly compared over the typical disease treatment period. OBJECTIVE The objective was to compare the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of three intravitreal antivascular endothelial growth factor agents for the management of macula oedema due to central retinal vein occlusion. DESIGN This was a three-arm, double-masked, randomised controlled non-inferiority trial. SETTING The trial was set in 44 UK NHS ophthalmology departments, between 2014 and 2018. PARTICIPANTS A total of 463 patients with visual impairment due to macula oedema secondary to central retinal vein occlusion were included in the trial. INTERVENTIONS The participants were treated with repeated intravitreal injections of ranibizumab (n = 155), aflibercept (n = 154) or bevacizumab (n = 154). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was an increase in the best corrected visual acuity letter score from baseline to 100 weeks in the trial eye. The null hypothesis that aflibercept and bevacizumab are each inferior to ranibizumab was tested with a non-inferiority margin of -5 visual acuity letters over 100 weeks. Secondary outcomes included additional visual acuity, and imaging outcomes, Visual Function Questionnaire-25, EuroQol-5 Dimensions with and without a vision bolt-on, and drug side effects. Cost-effectiveness was estimated using treatment costs and Visual Function Questionnaire-Utility Index to measure quality-adjusted life-years. RESULTS The adjusted mean changes at 100 weeks in the best corrected visual acuity letter scores were as follows - ranibizumab, 12.5 letters (standard deviation 21.1 letters); aflibercept, 15.1 letters (standard deviation 18.7 letters); and bevacizumab, 9.8 letters (standard deviation 21.4 letters). Aflibercept was non-inferior to ranibizumab in the intention-to-treat population (adjusted mean best corrected visual acuity difference 2.23 letters, 95% confidence interval -2.17 to 6.63 letters; p = 0.0006), but not superior. The study was unable to demonstrate that bevacizumab was non-inferior to ranibizumab in the intention-to-treat population (adjusted mean best corrected visual acuity difference -1.73 letters, 95% confidence interval -6.12 to 2.67 letters; p = 0.071). A post hoc analysis was unable to demonstrate that bevacizumab was non-inferior to aflibercept in the intention-to-treat population (adjusted mean best corrected visual acuity difference was -3.96 letters, 95% confidence interval -8.34 to 0.42 letters; p = 0.32). All per-protocol population results were the same. Fewer injections were required with aflibercept (10.0) than with ranibizumab (11.8) (difference in means -1.8, 95% confidence interval -2.9 to -0.8). A post hoc analysis showed that more bevacizumab than aflibercept injections were required (difference in means 1.6, 95% confidence interval 0.5 to 2.7). There were no new safety concerns. The model- and trial-based cost-effectiveness analyses estimated that bevacizumab was the most cost-effective treatment at a threshold of £20,000-30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. LIMITATIONS The comparison of aflibercept and bevacizumab was a post hoc analysis. CONCLUSION The study showed aflibercept to be non-inferior to ranibizumab. However, the possibility that bevacizumab is worse than ranibizumab and aflibercept by 5 visual acuity letters cannot be ruled out. Bevacizumab is an economically attractive treatment alternative and would lead to substantial cost savings to the NHS and other health-care systems. However, uncertainty about its relative effectiveness should be discussed comprehensively with patients, their representatives and funders before treatment is considered.

157278,Predictors and outcomes of heart transplantation utilizing donors with different brain death mode: A propensity-score matching study from China.,2020-08-15,"We previously demonstrated that tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) in human breast cancer sometimes form organized tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) characterized by CXCL13-producing T follicular helper (Tfh) cells. The present study found that CD4+ Tfh TIL, CD8+ TIL and TIL-B, co-localizing in TLS, all express the CXCL13 receptor CXCR5. An ex vivo functional assay determined that only activated, functional Th1-oriented Tfh TIL (PD-1hiICOSint phenotype) provide help for immunoglobulin and IFNγ production. A functional Tfh TIL presence signals an active TLS, characterized by humoral (immunoglobulins, Ki-67+ TIL-B in active germinal centers) and cytotoxic (GZMB+CD8+ and GZMB+CD68+ TIL plus Th1 gene expression) immune responses. Analysis of active versus inactive TLS in untreated patients revealed the former are associated with positive clinical outcomes. TLS also contain functional T follicular regulatory (Tfr) TIL, which are characterized by a CD25+CXCR5+GARP+FOXP3+ phenotype and a demethylated FOXP3 gene. Functional Tfr inhibited functional Tfh activities via a GARP-associated TGFβ-dependent mechanism. The activity of tumor-associated TLS was dictated by the relative balance between functional Tfh TIL and functional Tfr TIL. These data provide mechanistic insight into TLS processes orchestrated by functional Th1-oriented Tfh TIL, including TIL-B and CD8+ TIL activation and immunological memory generation. Tfh TIL, regulated by functional Tfr TIL, are an expected key target of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade.","Noël, Grégory; Langouo Fontsa, Mireille; Garaud, Soizic; De Silva, Pushpamali; de Wind, Alexandre; Van den Eynden, Gert G; Salgado, Roberto; Boisson, Anaïs; Locy, Hanne; Thomas, Noémie; Solinas, Cinzia; Migliori, Edoardo; Naveaux, Celine; Duvillier, Hugues; Lucas, Sophie; Craciun, Ligia; Thielemans, Kris; Larsimont, Denis; Willard-Gallo, Karen",The Journal of clinical investigation,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci139905; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34411002/,244

We investigated factors associated with primary care engagement among PWUD. METHODS The Participatory Research in Ottawa: Understanding Drugs (PROUD) cohort study meaningfully engaged and trained people with lived experience to recruit and survey marginalized PWUD between March-December 2013. We linked this survey data to provincial-level administrative databases held at ICES. We categorized engagement in primary care over the 2 years prior to survey completion as: not engaged (< 3 outpatient visits to the same family physician) versus engaged in care (3+ visits to the same family physician). We used multivariable logistic regression to determine factors associated with engagement in primary care. RESULTS Characteristics of 663 participants included a median age of 43 years, 76% men, and 67% living in the two lowest income quintile neighborhoods. Despite high comorbidity and a median of 4 (interquartile range 0-10) primary care visits in the year prior to survey completion, only 372 (56.1%) were engaged in primary care. Engagement was most strongly associated with the following factors: receiving provincial benefits, including disability payments (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 4.14 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.30 to 7.43)) or income assistance (AOR 3.69 (95% CI 2.00 to 6.81)), having ever taken methadone (AOR 3.82 (95% CI 2.28 to 6.41)), mental health comorbidity (AOR 3.43 (95% CI 2.19 to 5.38)), and having stable housing (AOR 2.09 (95% CI 1.29 to 3.38)). CONCLUSIONS Despite high comorbidity, engagement in primary care among PWUD was low. Our findings suggest that social care (housing, disability, and income support) and mental health care are associated with improved primary care continuity; integration of these care systems with primary care and opioid substitution therapy may lessen the significant morbidity and acute care use among PWUD.","Kendall, Claire E; Boucher, Lisa M; Donelle, Jessy; Martin, Alana; Marshall, Zack; Boyd, Rob; Oickle, Pam; Diliso, Nicola; Pineau, Dave; Renaud, Brad; LeBlanc, Sean; Tyndall, Mark; Bayoumi, Ahmed M",BMC health services research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-020-05670-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894114/,244

The value of superficial middle cerebral vein (SMCV) for predicting midline shift is currently unclear for patients with acute LAO. Methods: Consecutive acute LAO (middle cerebral artery M1 ± intracranial internal carotid artery) patients between March 2018 and May 2019 were included. Absent filling of ipsilateral cortical vein (marked as SMCV-) was defined as no contrast filling into the vein across the whole venous phase of four-dimensional computed tomography (CT) angiography derived from CT perfusion in the ischemic hemisphere. Results: In the total of 81 patients, 31 (38.4%) were identified as SMCV-. SMCV- independently predicted midline shift, with sensitivity of 87.5% and specificity of 82.5%. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that including SMCV- as a predictor in addition to baseline ischemic core volume significantly increased the area under the curve in predicting midline shift (SMCV- with baseline ischemic core volume vs. baseline ischemic core volume: AUC = 0.903 vs. 0.841, Z = 2.451, P = 0.014). Conclusion: In acute LAO patients, the presence of SMCV- was a sensitive and specific imaging marker for midline shift.

Antimicrobial activity of NSAIDs is often reported and this study evaluated the antimicrobial potential of the two most common NSAIDs, aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) and paracetamol (acetaminophen), against 293 clinical strains of bacteria. The ability of aspirin and paracetamol to convert minocycline and doxycyclin-resistant bacteria into sensitivity was also tested using micro-broth dilution assays used for determining minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Aspirin inhibited all 293 bacterial strains at ≤10.24 mg/ mL concentration. Except for one strain each of Serratia grimaceae and S, aureus paracetamol inhibited none of the 293 strains at 10.24 mg/ mL. Of the 293 strains 116 (39.59%) were sensitive (MIC ≤4 μg/mL) to doxycycline and 127 (43.34%) to minocycline. Of the selected 57 minocycline-resistant (MIC >4 μg/mL) strains aspirin converted 32 (56.14%) to minocycline-sensitive. Of the 49 doxycycline-resistant (MIC >4 μg/mL) strains tested in presence of aspirin 30 (61.22%) turned sensitive. Of the 34 doxycycline-resistant strains tested in presence of paracetamol 11 (32.35%) become sensitive. The study concluded that most of the bacterial strains were not susceptible to aspirin and paracetamol at their concentrations often available in plasma at maximum therapeutic dose levels and had no significant change in their susceptibility to doxycycline and minocycline. The study indicated the potential of aspirin and its combination with antibiotics in the development of therapeutically useful topical antimicrobial formulations.","Singh, Bhoj Raj",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.21.445232,244

Most models assume the transmission rate of a contagion does not vary over time. However, these rates do vary during an epidemic due to environmental conditions, social behaviors, and public-health interventions deployed to control the disease. Therefore, obtaining time-dependent rates can aid in understanding the progression of disease through a population. We derive an analytical expression using a standard SIR-type mathematical model to compute time-dependent transmission rate estimates for an epidemic in terms of either incidence or prevalence type available data. We illustrate applicability of our method by applying data on various public health problems, including infectious diseases (Ebola, SARS, and Leishmaniasis) and social issues (obesity and alcohol drinking) to compute transmission rates over time. We show that transmission rate estimates can have a large variation over time, depending on the type of available data and other epidemiological parameters. Time-dependent estimation of transmission rates captures the dynamics of the problem and can be utilized to understand disease progression through population accurately. Alternatively, constant estimations may provide unacceptable results that could have major public health consequences.","Ghosh, A.; Mubayi, A.; Pandey, A.; Brasic, C.; Ghosh, P.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.04.21258380v1?rss=1,244
164490,Guillain-Barré Syndrome after COVID-19 accompanied by Dysautonomia,2021,"The continued spread of SARS-CoV-2 and emergence of new variants with higher transmission rates and/or partial resistance to vaccines has further highlighted the need for large-scale testing and genomic surveillance. However, current diagnostic testing (e.g., PCR) and genomic surveillance methods (e.g., whole genome sequencing) are performed separately, thus limiting the detection and tracing of SARS-CoV-2 and emerging variants. Here, we developed DeepSARS, a high-throughput platform for simultaneous diagnostic detection and genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 by the integration of molecular barcoding, targeted deep sequencing, and computational phylogenetics. DeepSARS enables highly sensitive viral detection, while also capturing genomic diversity and viral evolution. We show that DeepSARS can be rapidly adapted for identification of emerging variants, such as alpha, beta, gamma, and delta strains, and profile mutational changes at the population level.

They are required to achieve competencies and undergo refresher courses. 1This training course was designed to provide teaching to fulfil the requirements of continuous professional development and improve midwife confidence in epidural management. Methods: A training course, delivered by anaesthetists, consisting of short PowerPoint presentations and panel-based discussion was devised with reference to the Royal College of Midwives curriculum.2 Because of restrictions imposed by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the programme was delivered on a virtual platform to midwives who were invited from all London NHS Trusts. A pre-course questionnaire was distributed focusing particularly on levels of confidence in the following aspects of epidural management: consent, administration of drugs and epidural maintenance, assessment of sensory and motor block and troubleshooting a suboptimal block. Two half-day sessions were delivered and delegates completed a post-course questionnaire to evaluate the effectiveness of this teaching programme. Results: A total of 304 midwives signed up from over 30 London NHS trusts, with 175 delegates able to attend. Delegates comprised of students (14%), band 5 (14%), band 6 (52%) and band 7–8 (20%) midwives. The breadth of experience with epidural anaesthesia ranged from less than 1 year to more than 10 years, with only half of the delegates previously receiving formal training. Improvements in confidence in all four aspects of epidural management are demonstrated in the figure. 97% thought this course was beneficial and 90% agreed that it was well delivered through a virtual platform. [Formula presented] Figure. Percentage of midwives who agreed or strongly agreed they were comfortable with these aspects of epidural management, pre-course (n=264) and post-course (n=149). Discussion: The pre-course questionnaire demonstrated that midwives had a need for epidural training and the post-course questionnaire has shown that this need was very well met. In addition, the convenience of a virtual course allowed us to reach good numbers of midwives and easily bring together speakers and delegates from across London. We plan to continue running this course virtually into the future.","Gaur, P.; Park, S.

We test this hypothesis in a small-scale subsistence society, the Tsimane. We associated relative household wealth (n=1003) and community-level wealth inequality (n=35, Gini = 0.15 - 0.43) with a range of psychosocial and health outcomes (depressive symptoms [n=663], social conflicts [n=393], non-social problems [n=390], social support [n=392], cortisol [n=828], BMI [n=9378], blood pressure [n=1614]), self-rated health [n=809], morbidities [n=3140]) controlling for absolute wealth, age, sex, community size, distance to town and relevant random effects. Relative wealth and inequality were associated with self-rated health and morbidity, especially respiratory disease, the leading cause of mortality in the Tsimane. Inequality was also associated with higher blood pressure. However, psychosocial stress did not mediate these associations, suggesting other mechanisms. These findings are consistent with socio-economic hierarchies affecting some health outcomes in any society, while others might be exacerbated in high-income countries.","Jaeggi, A. V.; Blackwell, A.

Whether to consider individuals at raised cardiovascular risk a priority group for vaccination against respiratory infections therefore remains unclear. Methods We conducted a cohort study in individuals aged 40-64 years without established CVD or a chronic health condition eligible for influenza vaccination, using Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD and Aurum data from 01/09/2008-31/08/2018 linked to Hospital Episode Statistics Admitted Patient Care and Office for National Statistics mortality data from England. We classified cardiovascular risk based on diagnosed hypertension and overall predicted cardiovascular risk estimated using QRISK2 score ([≥]10% compared with <10%). Using multivariable Poisson regression models, we obtained incidence rate ratios (IRR) for ARI. Among individuals who had an ARI, we then used multivariable Cox regression to obtain hazard ratios (HR) for the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) within one year of infection. Findings 4,212,930 individuals were included; 12.5% had hypertension and 14.4% had a QRISK2 score [≥]10%. After adjusting for confounders, patients with hypertension (IRR 1.04, 95% CI 1.03-1.05) or QRISK2 score [≥]10% (IRR 1.39, 1.37-1.40) had a higher incidence of ARI. Of the 442,408 individuals with an ARI, 4,196 had a MACE within one year of infection. After adjustment, hypertension (HR 1.98, 1.83-2.15) and QRISK2 score [≥]10% (HR 3.65, 3.42-3.89) were associated with substantial increased risk of a MACE after infection. Interpretation People without diagnosed CVD but who have raised cardiovascular risk, measured by diagnosed hypertension or, in particular, overall predicted cardiovascular risk, have increased incidence of both ARI and cardiovascular complications following an ARI.","Davidson, J.; Banerjee, A.; Smeeth, L.; McDonald, H.

173978,Myasthenia gravis and COVID-19: a systematic review of case reports and case series,2021,"The 3C-like protease (3CLpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is a potential therapeutic target for COVID-19. Importantly, it has an abundance of structural information solved as a complex with various drug candidate compounds. Collecting these crystal structures (83 Protein Data Bank (PDB) entries) together with those of the highly homologous 3CLpro of SARS-CoV (101 PDB entries), we constructed the crystal structure ensemble of 3CLpro to analyze the dynamic regulation of its catalytic function. The structural dynamics of the 3CLpro dimer observed in the ensemble were characterized by the motions of four separate loops (the C-loop, E-loop, H-loop, and Linker) and the C-terminal domain III on the rigid core of the chymotrypsin fold. Among the four moving loops, the C-loop (also known as the oxyanion binding loop) causes the order (active)–disorder (collapsed) transition, which is regulated cooperatively by five hydrogen bonds made with the surrounding residues. The C-loop, E-loop, and Linker constitute the major ligand binding sites, which consist of a limited variety of binding residues including the substrate binding subsites. Ligand binding causes a ligand size dependent conformational change to the E-loop and Linker, which further stabilize the C-loop via the hydrogen bond between the C-loop and E-loop. The T285A mutation from SARS-CoV 3CLpro to SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro significantly closes the interface of the domain III dimer and allosterically stabilizes the active conformation of the C-loop via hydrogen bonds with Ser1 and Gly2; thus, SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro seems to have increased activity relative to that of SARS-CoV 3CLpro.","Kidera, Akinori; Moritsugu, Kei; Ekimoto, Toru; Ikeguchi, Mitsunori",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.29.458083,244

Elderly people are most significantly affected with mortality ranging from 2.4% (age 60-69) to 19.6% (age≥80) in European Countries. The prevalence of COVID-19 and of its complications in patients with immune-mediated disorders, remains unclear. The frequency and impact of COVID-19 on patients with IgG4-related diease (IgG4-RD), many of whom are on concurrent immunosuppression has not been addressed. Objectives: To assess the epidemiological and clinical relevance of COVID-19 in patients with IgG4-RD. Methods: This is a multi-centre retrospective observational study of IgG4-RD patients from France, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. Demographics, comorbidities, IgG4-RD features, current and past treatment along with COVID-19-suggestive symptoms and COVID-19 diagnoses from February 2020 to January 2021 were recorded by means of direct or phone interviews. Patients with reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction-confirmed (cCOVID) or presumed COVID-19 based on clinical, serological or imaging features (pCOVID) were pooled for analysis (totCOVID) and compared to patients who were not diagnosed with COVID-19. Inter-group comparison of categorical and quantitative variables were performed by using the chi-square test with Fisher's correction and the Mann-Whitney's test respectively. Data are expressed as median (interquartile range) unless otherwise specified. Results: A total of 305 patients [71% males, median age 64 (54-74) years] were studied. Pancreato-biliary disease was the most frequently observed IgG4-RD phenotype (39%). Fifty-one percent of patients were taking corticosteroids at time of interview and 30% were on biological or conventional immunosuppressants. Thirty-two totCOVID cases (23 cCOVID, nine pCOVID) were identified: 11/32 were hospitalised, two needed intensive care and four (13%;3/4 aged ≥80 years) died. Having one or more infected family members was a risk factor for COVID-19 in patients with IgG4-RD (OR=19.9;p<0.001). No other demographic, clinical or treatment features associated with COVID-19. In particular there was no association between adverse outcomes with COVID-19 and higher doses of steroids (≥20mg) or rituximab administration. Conclusion: The prevalence and course of COVID-19 in IgG4-RD patients are similar to those of the general population of the same age, with no evident impact of disease-or treatment-related factors to the basal infectious risk. Effective public health countermeasures might be beneficial for patients with IgG4RD.","Ramirez, G.

Results In this work, we propose RENET2, a deep learning-based relation extraction method, which implements section filtering and ambiguous relations modeling to extract gene-disease associations from full-text articles. We designed a novel iterative training data expansion strategy to build an annotated full-text dataset to resolve the scarcity of labels on full-text articles. In our experiments, RENET2 achieved an F1-score of 72.13% for extracting gene-disease associations from an annotated full-text dataset, which was 27.22%, 30.30% and 29.24% higher than the best existing tools BeFree, DTMiner and BioBERT, respectively.

The contact interval from person i to person j is the time between the onset of infectiousness in i and infectious contact from i to j, where we define infectious contact as a contact sufficient to infect a susceptible individual. We show that the Nelson-Aalen estimator produces an unbiased estimate of the contact interval cumulative hazard function when who-infects-whom is observed. When who-infects-whom is not observed, we average the Nelson-Aalen estimates from all transmission networks consistent with the observed data using an EM algorithm. This converges to a nonparametric MLE of the contact interval cumulative hazard function that we call the marginal Nelson-Aalen estimate. We study the behavior of these methods in simulations and use them to analyze household surveillance data from the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic. In an appendix, we show that these methods extend chain-binomial models to continuous time.","Kenah, Eben",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1104.4338v1.pdf,244

We aimed to investigate the effects of MPV on hospitalization and mortality with a significant number of patients. METHODS: This multicenter study was carried out retrospectively on 9.487 patients. The demographic information and laboratory parameters of the patients were obtained from their medical records in the hospital. Analyses were performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22.0 for Windows. RESULTS: In total, there were 806 intensive care unit (ICU) patients, in addition to 8.681 non-ICU patients. The mean age of patients in ICU was significantly higher than non-ICU (71.25±13.42 vs. 56.17±16.59;p&lt;0.001). MPV values at admission and max MPV values during the period of hospitalization were significantly higher in patients followed in the ICU (p&lt;0.05). MPVfirst, MPVlast, ΔMPVlast-first, and ΔMPV% values were significantly higher in non-survivor group than the survived patients. As a result of receiver-operating characteristic analysis, the risk of mortality was determined to be 5.15 fold greater in people with MPVlast ≥10.05 fl. (ODDS ratio: 5.15 95% CI: 4.374–6.067).

Using a content analysis of emails and participant interviews, this work finds that while administrators intend to communicate empathy, messages fall short of fostering connection with faculty due to failing to cultivate buyin through quality feedback channels. The takeaways of this study of remote communication is that despite its mode, communication must be two way, and the authenticity of organizational communication becomes more important under pressure-filled circumstances.","Lovell, Darrell Dolamore Stephanie Collins Haley",Administration &amp; Society,https://doi.org/10.1177/00953997211026949,244

To monitor HIV risk behaviors and HIV prevalence among heterosexuals and other populations, CDC surveys persons in selected metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), using the National HIV Behavioral Surveillance System (NHBS). This report summarizes data collected from heterosexuals in 24 MSAs with a high prevalence of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) that participated in NHBS during 2006-2007. Of 14,837 heterosexuals aged 18-50 years who were interviewed and tested, 2.0% were HIV infected. HIV prevalence was higher among those with lower socioeconomic status (SES). For example, HIV prevalence was 2.8% among participants with less than a high school education compared with 1.2% among those with more than a high school education, 2.6% among participants who were unemployed compared with 1.0% among those who were employed, and 2.3% among participants with annual household incomes at or below the poverty level compared with 1.0% among those with incomes above the poverty level. This association between HIV prevalence and SES could not be attributed to factors commonly associated with HIV infection risk in heterosexuals, such as using crack cocaine, exchanging sex for things such as money or drugs, or being diagnosed with a sexually transmitted disease (STD). Based on the association observed between HIV prevalence and SES, HIV prevention activities targeted at heterosexuals in urban areas with high AIDS prevalence should be focused on those with lower SES.",,MMWR.

Where once individuals were concerned about the privacy of their conversations and financial information, the digitization of health data has created new challenges for those responsible for ensuring that patient information remains secure and private. Coupled with the lack of updated, overarching legislation, a critical gap exists between advancements in technology, consumer informatics tools and privacy regulations. Almost twenty years after the HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) compliance date, the healthcare industry continues to seek solutions to privacy challenges absent formal contemporary law. Since HIPAA, a few attempts have been made to control specific aspects of health information including genetic information and use of technology however none were visionary enough to address issues seen in today's digital data focused healthcare environment. The proliferation of digital health data, trends in data use, increased use of telehealth applications due to COVID-19 pandemic and the consumer's participatory role in healthcare all create new challenges not covered by the existing legal framework. Modern efforts to address this dilemma have emerged in state and international law though the United States healthcare industry continues to operate under a law written two decades ago. As technology continues to advance at a rapid pace along with consumers playing a greater role in the management of their healthcare through digital health the privacy guidance provided by federal law must also shift to reflect the new reality.","Theodos, Kim; Sittig, Scott",Perspectives in health information management,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33633522/,244

Despite several differences between PCR methods, there was good agreement, although some variation in sensitivity was observed. Most PCR methods were able to detect enterovirus RNA derived from 0.01 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) and were able to detect at least 1 TCID50 of enterovirus in cerebrospinal fluid, stool, or throat swab specimens. Most were also able to detect a wide range of enterovirus serotypes, although serotypic identification was not possible. Some laboratories experienced false-positive results due to PCR contamination, which appeared to result mainly from cross-contamination of specimens during RNA extraction. Provided that this problem is overcome, these PCR methods will prove to be a sensitive and rapid alternative to cell culture for the diagnosis of enterovirus infection.","Muir, P; Ras, A; Klapper, P E; Cleator, G M; Korn, K; Aepinus, C; Fomsgaard, A; Palmer, P; Samuelsson, A; Tenorio, A; Weissbrich, B; van Loon, A M",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10203496/,244

To confirm whether such features also exist in wild-type (wt) PEDV, the 3' 1800 nucleotides of its genome were sequenced and were found to be identical to those of ca virus. The coding potential of I-1 ORF was ascertained by transient expression in Vero cells followed by immunofluorescence using antipeptide sera. The I-1 protein was synthesized as a 12 kDa non-phosphorylated PEDV-specific protein that was not present in detectable amounts in virions. However, a low copy number of I-1 in the virion would suggest it is a structural component. Nevertheless, identical nucleotide sequences and gene expression strategies of attenuated ca virus and its virulent parent, wt PEDV, demonstrate that the 3' 1800 nucleotides or the genes and gene products encoded therein may not contribute to virus attenuation.","Singh, M",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10466791/,244
196414,Home mechanical ventilation in Hong Kong.,2004,"Viruses such as the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, that is wreaking havoc on the world, depend on interactions of its own proteins with those of the human host cells. Relatively small changes in sequence such as between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 can dramatically change clinical phenotypes of the virus, including transmission rates and severity of the disease. On the other hand, highly dissimilar virus families such as Coronaviridae, Ebola, and HIV have overlap in functions. In this work we aim to analyze the role of protein sequence in the binding of SARS-CoV-2 virus proteins towards human proteins and compare it to that of the above other viruses. We build supervised machine learning models, using Generalized Additive Models to predict interactions based on sequence features and find that our models perform well with an AUC-PR of 0.65 in a class-skew of 1:10. Analysis of the novel predictions using an independent dataset showed statistically significant enrichment. We further map the importance of specific amino-acid sequence features in predicting binding and summarize what combinations of sequences from the virus and the host is correlated with an interaction. By analyzing the sequence-based embeddings of the interactomes from different viruses and clustering them together we find some functionally similar proteins from different viruses. For example, vif protein from HIV-1, vp24 from Ebola and orf3b from SARS-CoV all function as interferon antagonists. Furthermore, we can differentiate the functions of similar viruses, for example orf3a's interactions are more diverged than orf7b interactions when comparing SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.","Kshirsagar, Meghana; Tasnina, Nure; Ward, Michael D; Law, Jeffrey N; Murali, T M; Lavista Ferres, Juan M; Bowman, Gregory R; Klein-Seetharaman, Judith",Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing.

196527,COVID-19 Recovery Without B Cells or Antibodies in Patients Receiving Rituximab for Autoimmune Disease.,2021-03-01,"BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted cancer diagnostic services. A decline in the number of new cancers being diagnosed over a relatively short term implies a delay in diagnosis and subsequent treatment. This delay is expected to have a negative effect on cancerrelated morbidity and mortality. The impact of the pandemic on the number of new cancer diagnoses in our setting is unknown. OBJECTIVES To assess the impact of COVID-19 on the number of new cancers diagnosed at our institution in the first 3 months following the implementation of lockdown restrictions, by focusing on common non-cutaneous cancers. METHODS A retrospective laboratory-based audit was performed at a large anatomical pathology laboratory in Western Cape Province, South Africa. The numbers of new diagnoses for six common cancers (breast, prostate, cervix, large bowel, oesophagus and stomach) from 1 April 2020 to 30 June 2020 were compared with the corresponding period in 2019. RESULTS Histopathological diagnoses for the six cancers combined decreased by 193 (-36.3%), from 532 new cases in the 2019 study period to 339 in the corresponding period in 2020. Substantial declines were seen for prostate (-58.2%), oesophageal (-44.1%), breast (-32.9%), gastric (-32.6%) and colorectal cancer (-29.2%). The smallest decline was seen in cervical cancer (-7%). New breast cancers diagnosed by cytopathology declined by 61.1%. CONCLUSIONS The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated response resulted in a substantial decline in the number of new cancer diagnoses, implying a delay in diagnosis. Cancer-related morbidity and mortality is expected to rise as a result, with the greatest increase in mortality expected from breast and colorectal cancer.","Van Wyk, A C; De Jager, L J; Razack, R; Van Wyk, S S; Kleinhans, W; Simonds, H M; Schubert, P T",South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34382569/,244

We have identified eight recombinant human single-chain variable region fragments (scFvs) against the S1 domain of spike (S) protein of the SARS-CoV from two nonimmune human antibody libraries. One scFv 80R efficiently neutralized SARS-CoV and inhibited syncytia formation between cells expressing the S protein and those expressing the SARS-CoV receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Mapping of the 80R epitope showed it is located within the N-terminal 261-672 amino acids of S protein and is not glycosylation-dependent. 80R scFv competed with soluble ACE2 for association with the S1 domain and bound S1 with high affinity (equilibrium dissociation constant, Kd=32.3 nM). A human IgG1 form of 80R bound S1 with a 20-fold higher affinity of 1.59 nM comparable to that of ACE2 (Kd=1.70 nM), and neutralized virus 20-fold more efficiently than the 80R scFv. These data suggest that the 80R human monoclonal antibody may be a useful viral entry inhibitor for the emergency prophylaxis and treatment of SARS, and that the ACE2-binding site of S1 could be an attractive target for subunit vaccine and drug development.","Sui, Jianhua; Li, Wenhui; Murakami, Akikazu; Tamin, Azaibi; Matthews, Leslie J; Wong, Swee Kee; Moore, Michael J; Tallarico, Aimee St Clair; Olurinde, Mobolaji; Choe, Hyeryun; Anderson, Larry J; Bellini, William J; Farzan, Michael; Marasco, Wayne A",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14983044/,244
199812,Development and validation of a new prognostic score system for COVID-19,2020,"INTRODUCTION TransAnal Minimally Invasive Surgery (TAMIS) has generated interest and attracted research in the last decade. This approach is used to treat primary benign and malignant diseases, but it can also be adopted to resolve colorectal complications, such as leak and fistula, bleeding and stenosis. A new reusable transanal platform formed by a new port and monocurved instruments has been invented and here presented. MATERIALS AND METHODS The first experience included 13 patients submitted to TAMIS for rectal adenocarcinoma (8), immediate colorectal leak (1), early rectovaginal fistula (1), late colorectal fistula (1), immediate colorectal bleeding (1), and benign stenosis (1). Mean age was 62.3 years (38-74), and mean BMI was 25.2 kg/m2 (20.5-32.1). RESULTS Mean operative time for transanal total mesorectal excision (TME) was 149.2 minutes (96-193) and for the other procedures 80.6 minutes (15-163). Mean operative bleeding was 51.1 cc (0-450). Mean hospital stay was 5.0 days (2-8). The 3 patients with coloanal anastomosis presented diarrhea postoperatively. No other early postoperative complications were registered. Pathologic report in the oncologic diseases showed that a mean number of 14.7 nodes (16-20) were removed. After a mean follow-up of 8 months (1-14), there were no late complications in any of the 13 patients treated. CONCLUSION TAMIS is a feasible alternative approach to treat rectal cancer and a completely new technique to manage colorectal complications. Moreover, this new transanal platform offers surgeons a satisfactory working ergonomy, with no increase in cost of the procedures, because entirely reusable materials are adopted.","Dapri, Giovanni; Guta, Daniel; Cardinali, Luca; Mazzetti, Claudia; Febres, Anny Cadenas; Grozdev, Konstantin; Sondji, Sixte-Henry; Surdeanu, Ion; Cadière, Guy-Bernard",Surgical technology international,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27042793/,244

New devices are created to facilitate dissection, haemostasis increasing the intraoperative cost. MATERIAL AND METHOD We prospectively examined patients undergoing to traditional thyroidectomy using reusable vs disposable devices (BiClamp 150, ERBE ® - group A vs. Harmonic Focus, ETHICON® - group B). The patients were treated for benign and malignant diseases from two experienced surgeons. The two groups were separated based on age, sex, skin-to-skin operative time, the number of parathyroid glands identified by the surgeon during the operation, preand post-operative serum calcium levels evaluated with PTH until 24 hours after surgery, the mean hospital stay, the evaluation of the content of the drainages at 6 hours and 24 hours, and the thyroid gland volume calculated via ultrasound preoperatively. The patients were asked to complete a form at 24 hours post-op to self-evaluate dysphagia to liquids and pain on a scale from 0 to 10. RESULTS The patients analysed were 80 pts. Analysis of the data showed no significant differences between the groups with respect to age, (p = 0:48), or gender, 9 males and 31 females in group A and 8 males and 32 females in group B.The thyroid volume (in ml), calculated on the basis of preoperative ultrasonography, was 43.89 ± 37.10 in group A vs. 54.54 ± 51.92 in group B (p = 0.35). The skin-to-skin operative time was equal to 50.16 ± 10.43 min.vs. 52.39 ± 11:54 min.(p = 0.36) in groups A and B, respectively. No statistically significant differences in pre e postoperative calcium levels. The amount of drainage at 6 hours after surgery was 16.63 ± 15.24ml. in group A and 23.72 ± 21.93ml. in group B (p = 0.07). At 24 hours after surgery, the amount was 57.84 ± 32.56ml. in group A and 66.79 ± 39.94ml. in group B (p = 0.28). For group A and group B, we analysed dysphagia for liquids on a scale from 0 to 10 (4.5 ± 2.35 vs. 4.18 ± 2.4, p = 0.48, respectively), alterations in patients' tone of voice (1.97 ± 2.51 vs. 1.43 ± 0:48, p = 0.29, respectively), and postoperative pain at 24 hours after surgery (2.76 ± 1.99 vs. 2.68 ± 2.12, p = 0.87, respectively). The average cost for group A was equal to € 25 × 40 = 1000 vs. € 450 × 40 = 18000 for Group B. The hospital stay in days was equal to 1.70 ± 0.46 (Group A) vs. 1.66 ± 0.53 (Group B) (p = 0.69). CONCLUSIONS One limitation of the current study is its small sample size. Both devices are effective and safe for total thyroidectomy because they have similar effects on the operative time, postoperative bleeding and patient outcomes in endocrine experienced surgical team. On the other hand, in a time of the spending review and the standardisation of surgical techniques to ensure the highest quality of services offered, the BiClamp is a viable alternative tool with a high security standard and low cost that offers significant savings to the health care system.

Among them, serological methods have been developed. Nevertheless, although these may present an interesting clinical performance, they are often directed against only one antigen. This study aims at evaluating the clinical performance of an innovative multiplex immunoassay (i.e., CoViDiag assay) detecting simultaneously the presence of antibodies directed against N, S1, S2, RBD and NTD antigens. Sensitivity was evaluated in 135 samples obtained from 94 rRT-PCR confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Non-SARS-CoV-2 sera (n = 132) collected before the COVID-19 pandemic with potential cross-reactions to the SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay were included in the specificity analysis. The antibody signature was also studied in hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients. The specificity of the CoViDiag assay was excellent for all antibodies (99.2 to 100%) using adapted cut-offs. None of the false positive samples were positive for more than one antibody. The sensitivity obtained from samples collected 14 days since symptom onset varied from 92.0 to 100.0% depending on the antibody considered. Among samples collected more than 14 days after symptom onset, 12.8, 66.3, 3.5, 9.3, 5.8 and 2.3% were positive for 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 or 0 antibodies, respectively. A trend toward higher antibody titers was observed in hospitalized patient in the early days since symptom onset. However, no significant difference was observed compared to non-hospitalized patients after 14 days since symptom onset. The clinical performance of the CoViDiag 5 IgG assay is sufficient to recommend its use for the detection and the characterization of the antibody signature following SARS-CoV-2 infection. The combination of several antigens in the same test improves the overall specificity and sensitivity of the test. Further research is needed to investigate whether this strategy may be of interest to identify severe disease outcome in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Gillot, Constant; Douxfils, Jonathan; Cadrobbi, Julie; Laffineur, Kim; Dogné, Jean-Michel; Elsen, Marc; Eucher, Christine; Melchionda, Sabrina; Modaffarri, Élise; Tré-Hardy, Marie; Favresse, Julien",,,244

Health inequities that underlie these disparities also exist within ophthalmology around the world, and more ophthalmologists should advocate for healthcare reform that advances health equity. Immediate actions to reduce health disparities in ophthalmology during the pandemic include taking time to ensure all ophthalmology leadership and industry is diversified with people reflecting the fabric of their countries, embracing telemedicine to increase access to medical care, and advocating for legislation that will increase health insurance coverage during this unprecedented time. Longitudinal actions include recognizing structural racism as a root cause of health inequity and actively rejecting it through addressing modifiable risk factors, increasing cultural competency training, promoting diversity in the workforce, and global leadership.","Mike, Elise V; Laroche, Daniel",Clin Ophthalmol,,244

The New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) established active, statewide surveillance to describe hospitalized patients with the syndrome. METHODS: Hospitals in New York State reported cases of Kawasaki's disease, toxic shock syndrome, myocarditis, and potential MIS-C in hospitalized patients younger than 21 years of age and sent medical records to the NYSDOH. We carried out descriptive analyses that summarized the clinical presentation, complications, and outcomes of patients who met the NYSDOH case definition for MIS-C between March 1 and May 10, 2020. RESULTS: As of May 10, 2020, a total of 191 potential cases were reported to the NYSDOH. Of 95 patients with confirmed MIS-C (laboratory-confirmed acute or recent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2] infection) and 4 with suspected MIS-C (met clinical and epidemiologic criteria), 53 (54%) were male; 31 of 78 (40%) were black, and 31 of 85 (36%) were Hispanic. A total of 31 patients (31%) were 0 to 5 years of age, 42 (42%) were 6 to 12 years of age, and 26 (26%) were 13 to 20 years of age. All presented with subjective fever or chills; 97% had tachycardia, 80% had gastrointestinal symptoms, 60% had rash, 56% had conjunctival injection, and 27% had mucosal changes. Elevated levels of C-reactive protein, d-dimer, and troponin were found in 100%, 91%, and 71% of the patients, respectively; 62% received vasopressor support, 53% had evidence of myocarditis, 80% were admitted to an intensive care unit, and 2 died. The median length of hospital stay was 6 days. CONCLUSIONS: The emergence of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children in New York State coincided with widespread SARS-CoV-2 transmission; this hyperinflammatory syndrome with dermatologic, mucocutaneous, and gastrointestinal manifestations was associated with cardiac dysfunction.","Dufort, Elizabeth M; Koumans, Emilia H; Chow, Eric J; Rosenthal, Elizabeth M; Muse, Alison; Rowlands, Jemma; Barranco, Meredith A; Maxted, Angela M; Rosenberg, Eli S; Easton, Delia; Udo, Tomoko; Kumar, Jessica; Pulver, Wendy; Smith, Lou; Hutton, Brad; Blog, Debra; Zucker, Howard",N Engl J Med,,244

Les patients souffrant d'un lupus systémique (LS) ont des facteurs de risque de développer des formes sévères de COVID-19 en raison des comorbidités fréquemment associées au LS (insuffisance rénale chronique, syndrome métabolique notamment) et des traitements corticoïdes et immunosuppresseurs. Jusqu'à présent, l'analyse des facteurs de risque de développer une COVID-19 sévère au cours du LS a été biaisée par le mode de recrutement des patients, puisque seuls les malades les plus symptomatiques ont été inclus dans les études. Nous avons réalisé une étude observationnelle de la COVID-19 chez les patients suivis pour un LS en incluant les malades asymptomatiques ou paucisymptomatiques dans le but d'analyser les facteurs associés à une forme grave de cette maladie. Les cas étaient recrutés de 3 façons différentes : déclarations spontanées au niveau local et au niveau national par les malades ou les médecins concernés ;déclaration à la cohorte french RMD COVID-19 (étude ancillaire organisée sous l'égide de la filière FAI2R) et dépistage par sérologie SARS-CoV-2 des malades avec lupus vus en consultation. Pour être inclus, les patients devaient remplir les critères de classification de lupus systémique de 1997 de l'ACR et/ou les critères actualisés de 2019 de l'EULAR/ACR et devaient avoir une infection à SARS-CoV-2 prouvée biologiquement par RT-PCR naso-pharyngée ou par sérologie sanguine. Les malades asymptomatiques ou paucisymptomatiques étaient recrutés au cours des consultations de suivi habituelles du LS. 109 patients (dont 89 % de femmes) ont été inclus entre le 1er mars 2020 et le 31 décembre 2020. L'âge médian (Q1, Q3) des cas était de 40 ans (33-56). Le score médian de séquelle (SLICC damage index) était de 0 (0-2). Les principales comorbidités étaient le surpoids (22 %), l'obésité (25 %), l'hypertension artérielle (22 %) et une maladie rénale chronique (21 %). 7 % étaient fumeurs actifs. 42 % avaient un antécédent de néphropathie lupique. 87 % étaient traités par hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), 63 % par corticoïde à la posologie moyenne de 8 mg/j (IC 95 % [6 ;10]) et 34 % par immunosuppresseur. Au moment de l'infection, 26 % rapportaient des signes d'activité clinique du LS, 51 % avaient une élévation des anticorps anti ADN double brin et 19 % une baisse du C3. Lors de la survenue de la COVID-19, L'HCQ, le corticoïde et l'immunosuppresseur étaient maintenus respectivement dans 92 %, 93 % et 79 % des cas. 9 patients (8 %) ont eu une infection asymptomatique par le SARS-CoV-2. La COVID-19 s'est manifestée pour 40 patients (40 %) par une simple infection des voies aériennes supérieures, pour 31 (29 %) par une bronchite et pour 32 (30 %) par une pneumonie. 29 patients (26 %) ont été hospitalisés, 22 (21 %) ont nécessité une oxygénothérapie, 12 (12 %) ont été transférés en unité de soins intensifs (USI), 9 (8 %) ont développé un syndrome de détresse respiratoire aiguë et 4 (4 %) sont décédés. En analyses multivariées par régression logistique, les deux seuls facteurs associés au recours à une oxygénothérapie étaient l'âge (p = 0,047) et l'obésité (p = 0,02). Le seul facteur associé à une admission en USI était l'âge (p = 0,01). Les corticoïdes, les immunosuppresseurs et l'antécédent de néphropathie lupique n'étaient pas indépendamment associés au risque de développer une forme nécessitant le recours à l'oxygénothérapie ou une hospitalisation en USI. La consultation médicale de surveillance au cours du LS a permis d'inclure un grand nombre de malade paucisymptomatique ou asymptomatique habituellement non étudiés dans ce type de travail. Cette série fournit des éléments rassurants quant aux facteurs de risque propres au LS de développer une forme grave de COVID-19. Ces facteurs de risque ne semblent en effet pas différents de ceux de la populat on générale, à savoir l'âge et l'obésité. Une maladie rénale chronique, une néphropathie lupique, un traitement par corticoïde et immunosuppresseur ne sont pas, dans cette cohorte, des facteurs indépendamment associés à une forme sévère de la maladie.

210028,Guidance on infection prevention and control of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in migrant and refugee reception and detention centres in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom,2020,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: A growing body of evidence suggests that obesity and increased visceral adiposity are strongly and independently linked to adverse outcomes and death due to COVID-19. This review summarizes current epidemiologic data, highlights pathogenetic mechanisms on the association between excess body weight and COVID-19, compares data from previous pandemics, discusses why COVID-19 challenges the ""obesity paradox,"" and presents implications in prevention and treatment as well as future perspectives. RECENT FINDINGS: Data from meta-analyses based on recent observational studies have indicated that obesity increases the risks of infection from SARS-CoV-2, severe infection and hospitalization, admission to the ICU and need of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and the risk of mortality, particularly in severe obesity. The risks of IMV and mortality associated with obesity are accentuated in younger individuals (age &#8804; 50 years old). The meta-inflammation in obesity intersects with and exacerbates underlying pathogenetic mechanisms in COVID-19 through the following mechanisms and factors: (i) impaired innate and adaptive immune responses; (ii) chronic inflammation and oxidative stress; (iii) endothelial dysfunction, hypercoagulability, and aberrant activation of the complement; (iv) overactivation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system; (v) overexpression of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in the adipose tissue; (vi) associated cardiometabolic comorbidities; (vii) vitamin D deficiency; (viii) gut dysbiosis; and (ix) mechanical and psychological issues. Mechanistic and large epidemiologic studies using big data sources with omics data exploring genetic determinants of risk and disease severity as well as large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are necessary to shed light on the pathways connecting chronic subclinical inflammation/meta-inflammation with adverse COVID-19 outcomes and establish the ideal preventive and therapeutic approaches for patients with obesity.","Dalamaga, Maria; Christodoulatos, Gerasimos Socrates; Karampela, Irene; Vallianou, Natalia; Apovian, Caroline M",Curr. obes. rep,,244

Dissertação (Mestrado) Faculdade de Zootecnia e Engenharia de Alimentos, Universidade de São Paulo, Pirassununga, 2017. Alterações cardiovasculares e hiperlipidemias são comuns em cães obesos. As apolipoproteínas (Apos) constituem um componente importante do perfil lipídico e, pelo menos em humanos, auxiliam na determinação do risco de aterosclerose, doenças vasculares e cardíacas. Sendo assim, o objetivo deste estudo foi relacionar a ocorrência de alterações cardiovasculares com fatores associados à aterosclerose, verificando também a influência da perda de peso sobre tais fatores e os parâmetros cardíacos e pressóricos. Vinte cadelas castradas, sendo 9 com ECC 4-5 (grupo controle) e 11 com ECC 8-9 (grupo obesidade) participaram desta pesquisa. Em relação ao grupo controle, o grupo obesidade apresentou o aumento da: massa gorda (em Kg e %), contagem de leucócitos, pressão arterial (PA) sistólica, concentração de triglicérides e VLDL, além da maior observação de cistites e de sinais de hipertrofia ventricular. Estes parâmetros se aproximaram da situação controle, após o emagrecimento, exceto pela ocorrência de cistites. Comparando-se os valores médios, os grupos controle e obesidade não diferiram nas avaliações eletrocardiográfica e ecocardiográfica e, tão pouco, nas concentrações de Apo A-I e B. Os resultados indicam que a redução da gordura corporal traz benefícios, devido à diminuição da concentração de colesterol (total, LDL e VLDL) e triglicérides, além da melhora nos parâmetros da avaliação cardiovascular. Além disso, a determinação das Apo A-I e Apo B podem auxiliar na avaliação do perfil lipídico, mas não apresentaram relação com as alterações cardiovasculares observadas nas cadelas obesas.","ROQUE, BEATRIZ KIIHL",,,244

The objective of this study was to estimate the incidence of and risk factors for COVID-19-related UMVs after outpatient COVID-19 diagnosis or positive SARS-CoV-2 test. METHODS: Data for this retrospective cohort study were from the Optum® de-identified COVID-19 Electronic Health Record database from June 1 to December 9, 2020. Adults with first COVID-19 diagnosis or positive SARS-CoV-2 test in outpatient settings were identified. Cumulative incidence function analysis stratified by risk factors was used to estimate the 30-day incidence of COVID-19-related UMVs. Competing risk regression models were used to derive adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for factors associated with UMVs. RESULTS: Among 206,741 patients [58.8% female, 77.5% non-Hispanic Caucasian, mean (SD) age: 46.7 (17.8) years], the 30-day incidence was 9.4% (95% CI 9.3-9.6) for COVID-19-related emergency room (ER)/urgent care (UC)/hospitalizations and 3.8% (95% CI 3.7-3.9) for COVID-19-related hospitalizations. Likelihood of hospitalization increased with age and body mass index, with age the strongest risk factor (aHR 5.61; 95% CI 4.90-6.32 for patients &#8805; 85 years). Increased likelihood of hospitalization was observed for first presentation in the ER/UC vs. non-ER/UC outpatient settings (aHR 2.35; 95% CI 2.22-2.47) and prior all-cause hospitalization (aHR 1.90; 95% CI 1.79-2.00). Clinical risk factors of hospitalizations included pregnancy, uncontrolled diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, and autoimmune disease. A study limitation is that data on COVID-19 severity and symptoms were not captured. CONCLUSION: Predictors of COVID-19-related UMVs include older age, obesity, and several comorbidities. These findings may inform patient management and resource allocation following outpatient COVID-19 diagnosis.","Wei, Wenhui; Sivapalasingam, Sumathi; Mellis, Scott; Geba, Gregory P; Jalbert, Jessica J",Adv Ther,,244

This includes an analytical validity study, a diagnostic accuracy study and an interventional clinical utility study. Current approaches to the design and analysis of the diagnostic accuracy study can suffer from prohibitively large sample sizes and interval estimates with undesirable properties. In this paper, we propose a novel Bayesian approach which takes advantage of information available from the analytical validity stage. We utilise assurance to calculate the required sample size based on the target width of a posterior probability interval and can choose to use or disregard the data from the analytical validity study when subsequently inferring measures of test accuracy. Sensitivity analyses are performed to assess the robustness of the proposed sample size to the choice of prior, and prior-data conflict is evaluated by comparing the data to the prior predictive distributions. We illustrate the proposed approach using a motivating real-life application involving a diagnostic test for ventilator associated pneumonia. Finally, we compare the properties of the proposed approach against commonly used alternatives. The results show that by making better use of existing data from earlier studies, the assurance-based approach can not only reduce the required sample size when compared to alternatives, but can also produce more reliable sample sizes for diagnostic accuracy studies.","Wilson, Kevin J.; Williamson, S.

220527,Validation of a risk score to predict patients at risk of critical illness with COVID-19,2020,"A key strategy to prevent a local outbreak during the COVID-19 pandemic is to restrict incoming travel. Once a region has successfully contained the disease, it becomes critical to decide when and how to reopen the borders. Here we explore the impact of border reopening for the example of Newfoundland and Labrador, a Canadian province that has enjoyed no new cases since late April, 2020. We combine a network epidemiology model with machine learning to infer parameters and predict the COVID-19 dynamics upon partial and total airport reopening, with perfect and imperfect quarantine conditions. Our study suggests that upon full reopening, every other day, a new COVID-19 case would enter the province. Under the current conditions, banning air travel from outside Canada is more efficient in managing the pandemic than fully reopening and quarantining 95% of the incoming population. Our study provides quantitative insights of the efficacy of travel restrictions and can inform political decision making in the controversy of reopening.","Linka, Kevin; Rahman, Proton; Goriely, Alain; Kuhl, Ellen",Comput Mech,,244

However, randomness can affect the game experience depending on when it occurs in a game, altering the chances of planning for a player. In this paper, we refer to it as""input-output randomness"". Input-output randomness is a cornerstone of collectable card games like Hearthstone, in which cards are drawn randomly (input randomness) and have random effects when played (output randomness). While the topic might have been commonly discussed by game designers and be present in many games, few empirical studies have been performed to evaluate the effects of these different kinds of randomness on the players' satisfaction. This research investigates the effects of input-output randomness on collectable card games across four input-output randomness conditions. We have developed our own collectable card game and experimented with the different kinds of randomness with the game. Our results suggest that input randomness can significantly impact game satisfaction negatively. Overall, our results present helpful considerations on how and when to apply randomness in game design when aiming for players' satisfaction.","Zhang, Yiwen; Monteiro, Diego; Liang, Hai-Ning; Ma, Jieming; Baghaei, Nilufar",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.08437v1.pdf,244

METHODS: A total of 60 patients were genotyped for CYP2D6*2XN, CYP2D6*4, CYP3A4*1B and CYP3A5*2. They were receiving HCQ for the treatment of RA. The patients were evaluated clinically for fever and dry cough, radiologically via chest computed tomography (CT) and immunologically via anti-Covid-19 IgG and IgM titers. RESULTS: Variants in CYP2D6 significantly affected the grade of ground glass (CYP2D6*4 AA carriers showed the higher risk for grade 3) and the risk of positive anti-Covid-19 IgM (CYP2D6*2XN CC and CYP3A4*1B AA had the lowest risk), the duration of HCQ, the use of corticosteroids or gender did not affect the Covid-19 status significantly. CONCLUSIONS: In general, the outcome of the studied patients receiving HCQ was good (no deaths, no intubation needed). CYP2D6 variants could affect the outcome of Covid-19 infection.","Salem Hareedy, Mohammad; Rashad, Sonya Mohamed; Hetta, Helal F; Hassanien, Sara Mahmoud; Abdellatif, Hebatallah; Hassanien, Manal",Drug Metab.

227380,Preeclampsia and the crucial postpartum period for Covid-19 infected mothers: A case report,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also called COVID-19, has caused a pandemic which has swiftly involved the entire world and raised great public health concerns. The scientific community is actively exploring treatments that would potentially be effective in combating COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine has been demonstrated to limit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 virus in vitro. In malarial pandemic countries, chloroquine is widely used to treat malaria. In malarial non-pandemic nations, chloroquine is not widely used. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine share similar chemical structures and mechanisms of action. The aim of this study was to indirectly investigate the efficacy of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19 by determining the prevalence of COVID-19 in malaria pandemic and non-pandemic nations. We sought evidence to support or refute the hypothesis that these drugs could show efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed in vitro studies, in vivo studies, original studies, clinical trials, and consensus reports, that were conducted to evaluate the antiviral activities of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. The studies on ""COVID-19 and its allied treatment were found from World Health Organization (WHO), ISI-Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Google Scholar, and clinical trial registries. The search was based on keywords: antiviral drugs, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, COVID-19, COVID-19 treatment modalities, and coronavirus. In addition, we analyzed the prevalence of COVID-19 in malaria pandemic and non-pandemic countries. The review and analyses were performed on March 28, 2020. RESULTS: For this study, we identified a total of 09 published articles: 03 clinical trials with sample size 150; 03 in vitro studies and 03 expert consensus reports. These studies were all suggestive that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine can successfully treat COVID-19 infections. We found that COVID-19 infections are highly pandemic in countries where malaria is least pandemic and are least pandemic in nations where malaria is highly pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have antiviral characteristics in vitro. The findings support the hypothesis that these drugs have efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19. People are currently using these drugs for malaria. It is reasonable, given the hypothetical benefit of these two drugs, that they are now being tested in clinical trials to assess their effectiveness to combat this global health crisis.","Meo, S A; Klonoff, D C; Akram, J",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,244

Then, three denoising filters, namely Gaussian, Bilateral, and Median, were applied to the different low-dose CT images, the quality of which was assessed prior to and after the application of the various filters via calculation of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), root mean square error (RMSE), structural similarity index measure (SSIM), and relative CT-value bias, separately for the lung tissue and whole-body. The quantitative evaluation indicated that 10%-dose CT images have inferior quality (with RMSE=322.1-+104.0 HU and bias=11.44-+4.49% in the lung) even after the application of the denoising filters. The bilateral filter exhibited superior performance to suppress the noise and recover the underlying signals in low-dose CT images compared to the other denoising techniques. The bilateral filter led to RMSE and bias of 100.21-+16.47 HU, -0.21-+1.20%, respectively in the lung regions for 20%-dose CT images compared to the Gaussian filter with RMSE=103.46-+15.70 HU and bias=1.02-+1.68%, median filter with RMSE=129.60-+18.09 HU and bias=-6.15-+2.24%, and the nonfiltered 20%-dose CT with RMSE=217.37-+64.66 HU and bias=4.30-+1.85%. In conclusion, the 20%-dose CT imaging followed by the bilateral filtering introduced a reasonable compromise between image quality and patient dose reduction.","Ghane, Behrooz; Karimian, Alireza; Mostafapour, Samaneh; Gholamiankhak, Faezeh; Shojaerazavi, Seyedjafar; Arabi, Hossein",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.08128v1.pdf,244

Therefore, it is all the more important to understand the characteristics of the virus and to utilize them in the diagnostics, treatment and epidemiology. This article firstly elucidates the medical significance of coronaviruses in general. Then angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the binding site of SARS-CoV­2 and the possible influence on disease susceptibility are explained. The gold standard for detection of an active SARS-CoV­2 infection is the direct detection of the pathogen with nucleic acid amplification techniques. At the onset of symptoms a swab of the upper airway is especially suitable due to the high viral load. At a later stage direct detection can be achieved in samples from the lower airway or in stool and anal swabs. Antibody tests cannot replace the direct detection of the pathogen; however, the detection of immunoglobulin G antibodies is of special interest for epidemiological questions (seroconversion time of sometimes several weeks). The plaque reduction neutralization test exclusively detects antibodies which neutralize viruses but the procedure is complicated and can only be carried out in secure laboratories (L3). In addition, the importance of these antibodies with respect to immunity against a second infection is uncertain. Thanks to modern techniques thousands of SARS-CoV­2 sequences are already available, which show a genomic variability. The D614G mutation in the S spikes seems to cause a higher infectiousness. Mutations can impair the diagnostics and treatment, which makes monitoring necessary.","Hoehl, S; Ciesek, S",Gastroenterologe,,244

Recently this well-established drug made its way back to the headlines during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. This led to an upsurge in the scientific arena with multiple research and review articles along with expert opinions and commentaries. The HCQ has received mixed judgements so far about its efficacy to be used in Covid-19 patients in a limited trial conducted all across the Globe. The purpose of our article is to put forth the history, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics, along with the existing studies favouring and disapproving the role of HCQ in the treatment of Covid-19. We grouped HCQ use at three stages, this includes HCQ for i. prophylactic use by asymptomatic health workers or peoples at higher risk; ii. patients having mild symptoms; iii. patients with extreme symptoms. The review critically discusses the underlying plausible reasons and mechanisms exploring HCQ in prophylactic management or treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, we have critically analysed the reported pharmacokinetic parameters and compiled the proponent, opponent, or neutral opinions on the use of HCQ in Covid-19.

DESIGN AND DATA SOURCES: Systematic review of 5 databases, and screening of eligible articles, from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2020. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We focused on quantitative and mixed-method studies that evaluated adolescent mental health literacy, appropriate package of services and provider competencies in mental health services, and that targeted depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder among adolescents (10-19 years). This included adolescents exposed to interventions or strategies within mental health services. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Study quality was assessed using the National Institutes for Health Study Quality Assessment Tools. Data were extracted and grouped based on WHO quality Standards. RESULTS: Of the 20 104 studies identified, 20 articles were included. The majority of studies came from high-income countries, with one from a low-income country. Most of the studies did not conceptualise quality. Results found that an online decision aid was evaluated to increase adolescent mental health literacy. Studies that targeted an appropriate package of services evaluated the quality of engagement between the therapist and adolescent, patient-centred communication, mental health service use, linkages to mental health services, health facility culture and intensive community treatment. Provider competencies focused on studies that evaluated confidence in managing and referring adolescents, collaboration between health facility levels, evidence-based practices and technology use. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: There is limited evidence on quality measures in adolescent mental health services (as conforms to the WHO Global Standards), pointing to a global evidence gap for adolescent mental health services. There are several challenges to overcome, including a need to develop consensus on quality and methods to measure quality in mental health settings.

Using CGM might reduce the exposure patients and healthcare workers to COVID-19 and limit the use of personal protective equipment during the pandemic. CGM devices measure glucose in the subcutaneous interstitial fluid, but the accuracy of this technique has not been established in critically ill patients. The artificial pancreas, STG-55 (Nikkiso, Tokyo), is a closed-loop device that conducts continuous blood glucose monitoring using a peripheral vein. We used the STG-55 for glucose control in a 60-year-old woman with severe COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit. Due to severe respiratory failure, the patient was intubated, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was introduced. Because she had hyperglycemia despite high-dose intravenous insulin therapy, we decided to use STG-55 for glucose control. The STG-55 safely titrated the insulin infusion and monitored glucose levels. Fifty-six hours after adopting the STG-55, it was removed because the blood sampling failed. No episodes of hypoglycemia were observed despite deep sedation during this period.

Children had mild symptoms and hardly infected other children or adults. It is worth considering that children are the most vulnerable to respiratory pathogens, but fatal SARS-like virus had not caused severe cases among them. According to the pathological studies of COVID-19 and SARS, a sharp decrease in T lymphocytes leads to the breakdown of the immune system. The cellular immune system of children differs from that of adults may be the keystone of atypical clinical manifestations or even covert infection. The frequent childhood vaccinations and repeated pathogens infections might be resulting in trained immunity of innate immune cells, immune fitness of adaptive immune cells or cross-protection of antibodies in the children. Therefore, due to lack of specific vaccine, some vaccines for tuberculosis, influenza and pneumonia may have certain application potential for the front-line health workers in the prevention and control of COVID-19. However, for high-risk susceptible populations, such as the elderly with basic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes, it is necessary to explore the remedial effect of the planned immune process on their immunity to achieve the trained immunity or immune fitness, so as to improve their own antiviral ability.","Lyu, Jinglu; Miao, Tianyu; Dong, Jiajia; Cao, Ranran; Li, Yan; Chen, Qianming",Med Hypotheses,,244

Cloth masks predominated on all dates (64.7-62.3%-62.6%), followed by medical (23.4-28.5%-26.9%). Being female (OR = 1.77-1.47-1.53 respectively) and location in a closed space (OR = 2.60-2.59-2.32) were each associated with higher usage. Participants in sports were about two times less likely to use masks (OR = 0.64-0.53-0.53) as compared to other activities. The proportion using masks correctly decreased gradually over time (364/552; 65.9%; 339/544; 62.3% and 304/516; 58.9%). More females wore masks correctly (date 1: 205/294; 69.7% vs 159/258; 61.6%, and date 3: 186/284; 65.5% vs 118/232; 50.9%; p = 0.045; p = 0.0008 respectively). Uncovered noses (47.3-52.7%) and masks around the neck (39.2-42.6%) were the most frequent incorrect practices. CONCLUSIONS: Practices were not in line with official recommendations, especially among males, and deteriorated over time. Cloth masks were predominantly used in public spaces. Health promotion, through utilizing all available communication channels, would be helpful to increase compliance.","Ganczak, Maria; Pasek, Oskar; Duda-Duma, Lukasz; Swistara, Dawid; Korzen, Marcin",BMC Public Health,,244

237547,Peripheral smear in COVID 19: a case report,2021,"The SARS-COVID-2019 pandemic of 2020 severely weakened the surgical innovation pipeline and ecosystem, primarily due to factors that include lack of a coordinated federal response, weakened health insurance coverage, a politicized approach to public health and safety, and disruption of the US economy. A successful bench to bedside innovation requires trust in the scientific research, open research and clinical facilities, and participation of patients in clinical studies. In addition, stay-at-home orders and the shutdown of elective medical and surgical care and research laboratories diminished opportunities for the informal interactions that are part of the new product development process. The pandemic and how it was managed prolonged the length of time for creation, adoption, and diffusion of new products and services into the market. Furthermore, the loss of hospital revenues from canceled elective care translates into a much smaller market for new technologies. Looking forward, critical success factors for innovation include federal policy that supports science and offers access and insurance coverage for health care, including addressing social determinants of health. Any further shutdowns of research and clinical care will hinder necessary collaborations between scientists, clinicians, and patients. Economic recovery is required to ensure federal and corporate funding for research and development. Trust in science must be restored to ensure support of necessary regulatory review processes and sufficient participation in clinical trials.

This was followed by evaluation of psychological factor that can act as a barrier in effective management of these patients. Methods: The survey was conducted on line using Google Form. After approval from hospital ethical committee survey link was disseminated to HCPs using social media. Results: Four hundred fifteen HCPs were participated. Most of them were younger than 30 years and majority of them were postgraduate trainees. Results showed gaps in the knowledge about basic infection control measure like donning/doffing and understanding about high-risk procedures. On job training, professional and administrative support is compromising. Many of HCPs are anxious nowadays, having symptoms related to burn out with logical reasons behind.

242084,Associations of baseline use of biologic or targeted synthetic DMARDs with COVID-19 severity in rheumatoid arthritis: Results from the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance physician registry,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Vaccination against the COVID-19 virus began in December 2020 in the UK and into Spring 2021 has been running at 5% population/week. High levels of social restrictions were implemented for the third time in January 2021 to control the second wave and resulting increases in hospitalisations and deaths. Easing those restrictions must balance multiple challenging priorities, weighing the risk of more deaths and hospitalisations against damage done to mental health, incomes and standards of living, education and provision of non-Covid-19 healthcare. METHODS: Weekly and monthly officially published data for 2020/21 were used to estimate the influence of seasonality and social restrictions on the spread of COVID-19 by age group, on the economy and on healthcare services. These factors were combined with the estimated impact of vaccinations and immunity from past infections into a model that retrospectively reflected the actual numbers of reported deaths closely both in 2020 and early 2021. The model was applied prospectively to the next 6 months to evaluate the impact of different speeds of easing social restrictions. RESULTS: The results show vaccinations as significantly reducing the number of hospitalisations and deaths. The central estimate is that relative to rapid easing, the avoided loss of 57 000 life-years from a strategy of relatively slow easing over the next several months comes at a cost in terms of GDP reduction of around £0.4 million/life-year loss avoided. This is over 10 times higher than the usual limit the NHS uses for spending against Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) saved. Alternative assumptions for key factors affecting the spread of the virus give significantly different trade-offs between costs and benefits of different speeds of easing. Disruption of non-Covid-19 Healthcare provision also increases in times of higher levels of social restrictions. CONCLUSION: In most cases, the results favour a somewhat faster easing of restrictions in England than current policy implies.","Miles, David K; Heald, Adrian H; Stedman, Michael",Int J Clin Pract,,244

An analysis of clinical trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov revealed that this may continue as many studies combine HCQ with agents that prolong the QT interval. Further, almost all of the trials registered do not consider dosage adjustment in the elderly, a patient population most likely to require HCQ treatment. Here we describe an inhaled formulation of HCQ which has passed safety studies in clinical trials for the treatment of asthma and discuss how this approach may reduce side-effects and improve efficacy. As this simple formulation progressed to phase II studies, safety data can be used to immediately enable phase II trials in COVID-19.","Kavanagh, Oisín; Marie Healy, Anne; Dayton, Francis; Robinson, Shane; O039,; Reilly, Niall J; Mahoney, Brian; Arthur, Aisling; Walker, Gavin; Farragher, John P",Med Hypotheses,,244
243325,The Age-AST-D Dimer (AAD) Regression Model Predicts Severe COVID-19 Disease,2021,"PURPOSE: The length of time a critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patient remains infectious and should therefore be isolated remains unknown. This prospective study was undertaken in critically ill patients to evaluate the reliability of single negative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in lower tracheal aspirates (LTA) in predicting a second negative test and to analyze clinical factors potentially influencing the viral shedding. METHODS: From April 9, 2020 onwards, intubated COVID-19 patients treated in the intensive care unit were systematically evaluated for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal swabs and LTA. The time to negativity was defined as the time between the onset of symptoms and the viral clearance in LTA. In order to identify risk factors for prolonged viral shedding, we used univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Forty-eight intubated SARS-CoV-2 patients were enrolled. Overall, we observed that the association of the first negative RT-PCR with a second negative result was 96.7%. Median viral shedding was 25 (IQR: 21.5-28) days since symptoms' onset. In the univariate Cox model analysis, type 2 diabetes mellitus was associated with a prolonged viral RNA shedding (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.41, 95% CI: 0.06-3.11, p = 0.04). In the multivariate Cox model analysis, type 2 diabetes was associated with a prolonged viral RNA shedding (HR: 0.31, 95% CI: 0.11-0.89, p = 0.029). CONCLUSION: Intubated patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus may have prolonged SARS-CoV-2 shedding. In critically ill COVID-19 patients, one negative LTA should be sufficient to assess and exclude infectivity.","Buetti, Niccolò; Trimboli, Pierpaolo; Mazzuchelli, Timothy; Lo Priore, Elia; Balmelli, Carlo; Trkola, Alexandra; Conti, Marco; Martinetti, Gladys; Elzi, Luigia; Ceschi, Alessandro; Consonni, Vera; Ogna, Adam; Forni-Ogna, Valentina; Bernasconi, Enos",Endocrine,,244
243550,CT Findings in a Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pneumonia at Initial Presentation,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 has initiated a global pandemic and several vaccines have now received emergency use authorization. Using the reference strain SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020, we evaluated modes of transmission and the ability of prior infection or vaccine-induced immunity to protect against infection in ferrets. Ferrets were semi-permissive to infection with the USA-WA1/2020 isolate. When transmission was assessed via the detection of vRNA at multiple timepoints, direct contact transmission was efficient to 3/3 and 3/4 contact animals in two respective studies, while respiratory droplet transmission was poor to only 1/4 contact animals. To determine if previously infected ferrets were protected against re-infection, ferrets were re-challenged 28 or 56 days post-infection. Following viral challenge, no infectious virus was recovered in nasal wash samples. In addition, levels of vRNA in the nasal wash were several orders of magnitude lower than during primary infection, and vRNA was rapidly cleared. To determine if intramuscular vaccination protected ferrets, ferrets were vaccinated using a prime-boost strategy with the S-protein receptor-binding domain formulated with an oil-in-water adjuvant. Upon viral challenge, none of the mock or vaccinated animals were protected against infection, and there were no significant differences in vRNA or infectious virus titers in the nasal wash. Combined these studies demonstrate that in ferrets direct contact is the predominant mode of transmission of the USA-WA1/2020 isolate and immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is maintained for at least 56 days. Our studies also indicate protection of the upper respiratory tract against SARS-CoV-2 will require vaccine strategies that mimic natural infection or induce site-specific immunity.Importance:The SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 strain is a CDC reference strain used by multiple research laboratories. Here, we show the predominant mode of transmission of this isolate in ferrets is by direct contact. We further demonstrate ferrets are protected against re-infection for at least 56 days even when levels of neutralizing antibodies are low or undetectable. Last, we show that when ferrets were vaccinated by the intramuscular route to induce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, ferrets remain susceptible to infection of the upper respiratory tract. Collectively, these studies suggest protection of the upper respiratory tract will require vaccine approaches that mimic natural infection.","Patel, Devanshi R; Field, Cassandra J; Septer, Kayla M; Sim, Derek G; Jones, Matthew J; Heinly, Talia A; Vanderford, Thomas H; McGraw, Elizabeth A; Sutton, Troy C",J. virol,,244

244197,Consideration Needed for early Anticoagulation Following Intravenous tPA in Patients with COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Given the sudden shift to telemedicine during the early COVID-19 pandemic, we conduct a survey of practicing-physician telehealth experience during pre-pandemic and early-pandemic periods. Our survey estimates that most U.S. patient-visits during the early COVID-19 pandemic period were conducted via telehealth. Given this magnitude and potential benefits/challenges of telehealth for U.S. healthcare, we obtain, summarize, and analyze telehealth views/experiences of U.S. practicing-physicians. OBJECTIVE: From the U.S. practicing-physician perspective, we examine extent of shift toward telehealth training and care provision during the early-pandemic. We seek to determine the shift's short- and long-term implications upon quality, access, and mode of U.S. healthcare delivery. METHODS: A purposive, snowball-sampled survey of 148 U.S. practicing-physicians. Data was collected from July 17, 2020 through September 4, 2020. RESULTS: Sample training intensity scaled 21-fold during the early-pandemic period; patient-care visits conducted via telehealth rose from 13.1%, on average, directly before pandemic to 59.7%, on average, during early-pandemic. Physicians feel that telehealth patient-visits and face-to-face patient-visits are comparable in quality; the difference is not statistically significant in a non-parametric sign test (P = 0.11). Physicians feel that telehealth care should continue to play a larger role (44.9% of visits) in U.S. healthcare post-pandemic. Survey findings suggest high market-concentration in telehealth softwares, a market-structural characteristic that may have implications upon cost and access. Results vary markedly by physician employer-type. CONCLUSIONS: During the shift toward telehealth, there has been considerable discovery among physicians regarding U.S. telehealth physicians. Physicians are now better-prepared to undertake telehealth care from a training perspective. They are favorable toward a permanently-expanded telehealth role, with potential for enhanced healthcare access; realization of enhanced access may depend upon market-structural characteristics of telehealth software platforms. Key Terms: physician survey, U.S. telehealth training, U.S. telehealth care, COVID-19 pandemic, snowball sampling, healthcare access, healthcare quality.","Walia, Bhavneet; Shridhar, Anshu; Arasu, Pratap; Kaur, Gursimar",,,244

Nowadays, currently under a pandemic crisis, public transportation must be used with limitations regarding the number of occupants to prevent the spread of the virus and commuters are turning even more to private cars to perform their daily trips. Carpooling under a set of precaution rules is a potential solution to help commuters perform their daily trips while respecting COVID-19 safety recommendations. This research aimed to develop an analysis of the road traffic and emission impacts of implementing carpooling, with social distancing measures, in three university campus networks through microscopic traffic simulation modeling and microscopic vehicular exhaust emissions estimation. Results indicate that employing carpooling for groups of up to three people to safely commute from their residence area to the university campus has the potential to significantly reduce pollutant emissions (reductions of 5% and 7% in carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides can be obtained, respectively) within the network while significantly improving road traffic performance (average speed increased by 7% and travel time reduced by 8%).","Tomás, Ricardo Fernandes Paulo Macedo Joaquim Margarida Cabrita Coelho",Sustainability,,244

METHODS: We matched lab-confirmed COVID-19 case and death data reported to the NYC Health Department as of June 2, 2020, against the NYC HIV surveillance registry. We describe and compare the characteristics and COVID-19-related outcomes of PWH diagnosed with COVID-19 with all NYC PWH and with all New Yorkers diagnosed with COVID-19. RESULTS: Through June 2, 204,583 NYC COVID-19 cases were reported. The registry match identified 2,410 PWH with diagnosed COVID-19 eligible for analysis (1.06% of all COVID-19 cases). Compared with all NYC PWH and all New Yorkers diagnosed with COVID-19, a higher proportion of PWH with COVID-19 were older, male, Black or Latino, and living in high-poverty neighborhoods. At least one underlying condition was reported for 58.9% of PWH with COVID-19. Compared with all NYC COVID-19 cases, a higher proportion of PWH with COVID-19 experienced hospitalization, intensive care unit admission and/or death; most PWH who experienced poor COVID-19-related outcomes had CD4 <500 cells/µL. CONCLUSIONS: Given NYC HIV prevalence is 1.5%, PWH were not overrepresented among COVID-19 cases. However, compared with NYC COVID-19 cases overall, a greater proportion of PWH had adverse COVID-19-related outcomes, perhaps because of a higher prevalence of factors associated with poor COVID-19 outcomes. Given the pandemic's exacerbating effects on health inequities, HIV public health and clinical communities must strengthen services and support for people living with and affected by HIV.","Braunstein, Sarah L; Lazar, Rachael; Wahnich, Amanda; Daskalakis, Demetre C; Blackstock, Oni J",Clin. infect. dis,,244

In this article, we will define the physiological, psychological and social aspects, stages, and components of stress reactions in the context of COVID-19, review the relevant literature on stress reactions, and offer some guidance on how to help patients mitigate the physiological and psychological impact of the pandemic through resilience-building techniques. RECENT FINDINGS: There is continued evidence that the fight or flight response involves activation throughout the body at physiological, biochemical and immune levels. This response can be mitigated through increasing parasympathetic nervous system activation as well as cognitive and behavioral interventions. SUMMARY: This article will review the stress, provide a theoretical layout to predict upcoming response, and offer clinicians some practical interventions to employ as the stress of the COVID-19 pandemic continues.","Lupe, Stephen E; Keefer, Laurie; Szigethy, Eva",Curr Opin Gastroenterol,,244

The in vivo efficacy of CQ in the treatment of COVID-19 is currently a matter of debate. CQ is a lysosomotrophic compound that accumulates in lysosomes, as well as in food vacuoles of Plasmodium falciparum. In the treatment of malaria, CQ impairs the digestion and growth of the parasite by increasing the pH of the food vacuole. Similarly, it is assumed that the antiviral effects of CQ results from the increase of lysosome pH and the inhibition of acidic proteases involved in the maturation of virus fusion protein. CQ has however other effects, among which phospholipidosis, characterized by the accumulation of multivesicular bodies within the cell. The increase in phospholipid species particularly concerns bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP), a specific lipid of late endosomes involved in vesicular trafficking and pH-dependent vesicle budding. It was shown previously that drugs like progesterone, the cationic amphiphile U18666A and the phospholipase inhibitor methyl arachidonyl fluoro phosphonate (MAFP) induce the accumulation of BMP in THP-1 cells and decrease cell infection by human immunodeficiency virus. HIV viral particles were found to be retained into large endosomal-type vesicles, preventing virus spreading. Since BMP was also reported to favour virus entry through hijacking of the endocytic pathway, we propose here that BMP could play a dual role in viral infection, with its antiviral effects triggered by lysosomotropic drugs like CQ.","Carrière, Frédéric; Longhi, Sonia; Record, Michel",Biochimie,,244

End-stage lung disease from COVID-19 is a new and growing entity that may benefit from lung transplant, however there is limited data on the patient selection, perioperative management and expected outcomes of transplantation for this indication. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was performed with searches of MEDLINE and Web of Science databases as well the gray literature. All manuscripts, editorials, commentaries and gray literature reports of lung transplantation for COVID related respiratory failure were included. A case from the University of Virginia is described and included in the review. RESULTS: A total of 27 studies were included; 11 manuscripts, 5 commentaries, and 11 gray literature reports. The total number of transplantations for COVID related lung disease was 21. The mean age was 55 ± 12 years, 16 (76%) were male, and the acuity was high with 85% on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation preoperatively. There was a 95% early survival rate, with one additional late death. There is growing histopathologic evidence for permanent structural damage with no replicating virus at the time of transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral lung transplantation is an effective treatment option with reasonable short-term outcomes for patients suffering from end-stage lung failure secondary to COVID-19. However, specific considerations in this new population require a multidisciplinary approach. As we move into the second wave of the COVID-19 global pandemic, lung transplantation will likely have a growing role in management of these complex patients.","Hawkins, Robert B; Mehaffey, J Hunter; Charles, Eric J; Mannem, Hannah C; Roeser, Mark",Transplantation,,244
254752,Clinical and demographic characteristics of patients dying from COVID-19 in Italy vs China,2020,"Cardiac glycosides (CGs) have a long history of treating cardiac diseases. However, recent reports have suggested that CGs also possess anticancer and antiviral activities. The primary mechanism of action of these anticancer agents is by suppressing the Na+/k+-ATPase by decreasing the intracellular K+ and increasing the Na+ and Ca2+. Additionally, CGs were known to act as inhibitors of IL8 production, DNA topoisomerase I and II, anoikis prevention and suppression of several target genes responsible for the inhibition of cancer cell proliferation. Moreover, CGs were reported to be effective against several DNA and RNA viral species such as influenza, human cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, coronavirus, tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus and Ebola virus. CGs were reported to suppress the HIV-1 gene expression, viral protein translation and alters viral pre-mRNA splicing to inhibit the viral replication. To date, four CGs (Anvirzel, UNBS1450, PBI05204 and digoxin) were in clinical trials for their anticancer activity. This review encapsulates the current knowledge about CGs as anticancer and antiviral drugs in isolation and in combination with some other drugs to enhance their efficiency. Further studies of this class of biomolecules are necessary to determine their possible inhibitory role in cancer and viral diseases.","Reddy, Dhanasekhar; Kumavath, Ranjith; Barh, Debmalya; Azevedo, Vasco; Ghosh, Preetam",Molecules (Basel),,244

Macrodomains are implicated in viral genome replication and interference with host cell immune responses. They are important to the infectious cycle of Coronaviridae and Togaviridae viruses. We describe crystal structures of the conserved macrodomain from the bat coronavirus (CoV) HKU4 in complex with ligands. The structures reveal a binding cavity that accommodates ADPR and analogs via local structural changes within the pocket. Using a radioactive assay, we present evidence of mono-ADPR (MAR) hydrolase activity. In silico analysis presents further evidence on recognition of the ADPR modification for hydrolysis. Mutational analysis of residues within the binding pocket resulted in diminished enzymatic activity and binding affinity. We conclude that the common structural features observed in the macrodomain in a bat CoV contribute to a conserved function that can be extended to other known macrodomains.","Hammond, Robert G; Schormann, Norbert; McPherson, Robert Lyle; Leung, Anthony K L; Deivanayagam, Champion C S; Johnson, Margaret A",Proc.

The race for vaccination has exacerbated tendencies of hoarding, particularly among rich countries, academically expressed as vaccine nationalism. Vaccine nationalism is harmful to the global effort in the fight against the pandemic. India in contrast has been quite generous to its neighbours in sharing vaccines pursuing its own form of vaccine nationalism. The strategy pursued by India can be read as an effort to gloss over the failures in initial pandemic management, to improve diplomatic leverage and reinforce an idiom of nationalism. Such an effort however has potentially harmful effects undermining trust in the vaccine as well as in the government. The politicization of vaccine also has counterproductive outcomes for democratic practices within the country.

258065,A Case Report of Tracheostomy for a Patient with COVID-19: How to Minimize Medical Staff and Patient Risks,2020,"Background: The recent ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), still is an unsolved problem with a growing rate of infected cases and mortality worldwide. The novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is targeting the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and mostly causes a respiratory illness. Although acquired and resistance immunity is one of the most important aspects of alleviating the trend of the current pandemic; however, there is still a big gap of knowledge regarding the infection process, immunopathogenesis, recovery, and reinfection. Aim of Review: To answer the questions regarding ""the potential and probability of reinfection in COVID-19 infected cases"" or ""the efficiency and duration of SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced immunity against reinfection"" we critically evaluated the current reports on SARS-CoV-2 immunity and reinfection with special emphasis on comparative studies using animal models that generalize their finding about protection and reinfection. Also, the contribution of humoral immunity in the process of COVID-19 recovery and the role of ACE2 in virus infectivity and pathogenesis has been discussed. Furthermore, innate and cellular immunity and inflammatory responses in the disease and recovery conditions are reviewed and an overall outline of immunologic aspects of COVID-19 progression and recovery in three different stages are presented. Finally, we categorized the infected cases into four different groups based on the acquired immunity and the potential for reinfection. Key Scientific Concepts of Review: In this review paper, we proposed a new strategy to predict the potential of reinfection in each identified category. This classification may help to distribute resources more meticulously to determine: who needs to be serologically tested for SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, what percentage of the population is immune to the virus, and who needs to be vaccinated.","Khoshkam, Zahra; Aftabi, Younes; Stenvinkel, Peter; Paige Lawrence, B; Rezaei, Mehran Habibi; Ichihara, Gaku; Fereidouni, Sasan",,,244

According to Center for Disease Control (CDC), over 270,000 Americans die of sepsis each year and 1 in 3 hospital mortalities is attributed to sepsis. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) Guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock published in 2004 provide key elements in the treatment of sepsis that are organized into two bundles of care, the ""resuscitation"" and ""management"" bundles, including interventions to be accomplished within specified timeframes. In this quality improvement study, we implemented a sepsis intervention protocol (SIP) intended to increase adherence to 3-hour and 6-hour bundles, and to examine the impact on mortality of patients presenting with severe sepsis and septic shock in our emergency department. We analyzed data from our emergency department as reported to the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) from 2017Q2 to 2018Q2 (April 2017 -June 2018), the period prior to implementation of SIP, compared to data from 2018Q3 to 2019Q2 (July 2018 to June 2019) after implementation of SIP. The implementation of SIP resulted in increased3-hour and 6-hour bundle adherence and showed a clinically significant reduction of the mean pre-intervention hospital percent mortality of 40.3% to a mean post-intervention hospital percent mortality of 28.7%. A t-test analysis of the pre and post intervention mean hospital percent mortality revealed a reduction in mortality outcomes that was also statistically significant (p <0.05). Our study demonstrates that a well-designed and implemented SIP can increase bundle adherence and is highly effective in reducing mortality among high-risk population.","Igiebor, Osagie; Nakeshbandi, Mohamed; Mehta, Ninfa; Ozaki, Randi; Lucchesi, Michael; Daley, Maryanne; Salifu, Moro O; McFarlane, Samy I",,,244

The palliative care program at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, Canada, provides comprehensive care to patients with advanced cancer and their families, through services including an acute palliative care unit, an inpatient consultation service, and an ambulatory palliative care clinic. In the face of a global pandemic, palliative care teams are uniquely placed to support patients with cancer who also have COVID-19. This may include managing severe symptoms such as dyspnea and agitation, as well as guiding advance care planning and goals of care conversations. In tandem, there is a need for palliative care teams to continue to provide care to patients with advanced cancer who are COVID-negative but who are at higher risk of infection and adverse outcomes related to COVID-19. This paper highlights the unique challenges faced by a palliative care team in terms of scaling up services in response to a global pandemic while simultaneously providing ongoing support to their patients with advanced cancer at a tertiary cancer center.","Hannon, Breffni; Mak, Ernie; Al Awamer, Ahmed; Banerjee, Subrata; Blake, Christopher; Kaya, Ebru; Lau, Jenny; Lewin, Warren; O039,; Connor, Brenda; Saltman, Alexandra; Zimmermann, Camilla",Support Care Cancer,,244

SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the ongoing global pandemic, and SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were responsible for causing severe respiratory illness and regional epidemics in the past while the four other strains of CoVs (229-E OC43, NL63, and HKU1) circulate worldwide and normally only cause mild upper respiratory tract infections. Given the enormous diversity of coronavirus viruses in wildlife and their continuous evolution and adaptation to humans, future outbreaks would undoubtedly occur. Restricting or banning all trade in wild animals in wet markets would be a necessary measure to reduce future zoonotic infections.","Leao, Jair Carneiro; Gusmao, Teresa Paula de Lima; Zarzar, Adriana Machado; Leao Filho, Jair Carneiro; Barkokebas Santos de Faria, Andreza; Morais Silva, Igor Henrique; Gueiros, Luiz Alcino Monteiro; Robinson, Narendran Andrew; Porter, Stephen; Carvalho, Alessandra de Albuquerque Tavares",Oral dis,,244

266924,Use of convalescent Plasma in COVID-19 patients,2020,"Objective: To analyze of the transmission characteristics of a cluster of COVID-19 cases in Chongqing and evaluate the infectivity of COVID-19 in the incubation period. Methods: A retrospective survey was conducted by using unified questionnaire through field and telephone interviews among 129 close contacts of COVID-19 cases. The relationship of transmission was indicated by transmission chain, and the infectivity was analyzed by the contact history. Results: This cluster of COVID-19 cases occurred after a classmate party involving members in three families and work fellows in a factory (R(0)=3.8). The infection rate during the incubation period was 17.57%. On average, it was infectious three days before onset. There was significant difference in infection rate among different contact modes (&#967;(2)=15.10, P<0.01),There was significant difference in infection rate among single exposureswith different time length ( &#967;(2)=25.08, P<0.01). Conclusions: COVID-19 is highly infectious in the incubation period. The more confined the space is, the higher the risk is,and the longer the single exposure is, the higher the risk of transmission is. Indirect contact transmission still exists.","Zhao, H; Li, B S; Xia, Y; Zhou, H L; Li, T R; Zeng, Y; Zhu, X L; Zhou, Y X; Li, Q",Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,,244

Efforts to limit the number of new infections are threatened by the advent of new variants of the SARS-COV-2 virus, most prominent the B.1.1.7 strain with higher infectivity. In this article we consider a basic two-strain SIR model to explain the spread of those variants in Germany on small time scales. For a linearized version of the model we calculate relevant variables like the time of minimal infections or the dynamics of the share of variants analytically. These analytical approximations and numerical simulations are in a good agreement to data reported by the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) in Germany.","Gotz, Thomas; Bock, Wolfgang; Rockenfeller, Robert; Schafer, Moritz",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.11333v1.pdf,244

We conducted an observational safety study simulating PAPR failure in a group of nine healthy volunteers, wearing loose-fitting hoods, who were observed for a period of ten minutes, or until they requested the experiment be aborted, with continuous monitoring of gas exchange. Relative to baseline, participants demonstrated median reductions in peripheral oxygen saturation of 3.5% (95% confidence interval (CI) -4% to -2%; P = 0.0039) and fraction of inspired oxygen of 0.045 (95% CI -0.05 to -0.04; P = 0.0039), and median increases in inspired partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 27 mmHg (95% CI 23.5-32 mmHg; P = 0.0039), end-tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 11 mmHg (95% CI 7-16 mmHg; P = 0.0039) and minute ventilation of 30 l/min (95% CI 19.4-35.9 l/min; P = 0.0039).

However, since not all population groups experience the impacts of the pandemic in the same way, the objective of this study was to identify the individual characteristics associated with the feeling of uncertainty during the lockdown that commenced in March 2020 in Greece. The study used data from the ""Public Opinion in the European Union (EU) in Time of Coronavirus Crisis"" survey. The sample consisted of 1050 individuals aged between 16 and 54 years. According to the analysis, which was based on a logistic regression model, the emotional status of older individuals, those who experienced income and job losses since the beginning of the pandemic, and middle-class and high-class individuals, is more likely to be described as a feeling of uncertainty. In addition, the emotional status of individuals with less concern for their own health and that of family and friends is less likely to be described as a feeling of uncertainty. Although the results related to age, income, and job losses, as regards concern for health, agree with the international literature, the limited health literacy of lower-class individuals may explain the reduced likelihood of their experiencing feelings of uncertainty. The results confirm the international literature describing several aspects of uncertainty due to the COVID-19 crisis.","Zavras, Dimitris",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,244

SARS-CoV2 is a new virus that originated from China and is currently spread across 160 countries. Siddha medicine is one of the traditional Indian medicines, part of Ayush that tend to treat several acute and chronic diseases. Aim: The objective of this study is to observe the safety and efficacy of Siddha regimen with lab parameters like LFT, RFT, RT-PCR, LDH, FERRITIN levels, and prevention of disease complications in covid-19 positive patients on the 7th day of treatment. Experimental Procedure: A nonrandomized open-label observational retrospective study was designed. Twenty patients of either sex, of age between 18 and 60 years, were selected with proper consent. The covid patients who were confirmed by positive RT-PCR test results with or without clinical features of covid-19 were selected. They were treated with Siddha Regimen for seven days. Results: Sixteen out of 20 cases turned RT-PCR negative on their 7th day of treatment. And the Ct value of RT-PCR was statistically significant. LDH and Ferritin levels were reduced after the treatment even though the before treatment values are in the normal range. The LDH level was statistically significant on the 7th day of treatment. No Remarkable changes in the safety laboratory parameters like SGOT, SGPT, Blood urea, Serum Creatinine. Conclusion: Significant changes in efficacy laboratory parameters and no changes in safety laboratory parameters have been reported in the Siddha fixed regimen for covid-positive patients.

276601,Convalescent Plasma For COVID-19: A Reasonable Option For The Pandemic Based On Both Scientific And Practical Point Of Views,2020,"OBJECTIVE/BACKGROUND: A few case reports in the setting of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays for common respiratory pathogens have shown a higher yield of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples than upper airway specimens in immunocompromised patients. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted reviewing patients diagnosed with COVID-19 at the Medical College of Wisconsin (Milwaukee, WI, USA) between March 13, 2020 and June 11, 2020. All patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 via real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), through a nasopharyngeal or a bronchoscopy specimen. RESULTS: During the study period, 53 bronchoscopy procedures were performed at the institution, of which five patients tested positive for COVID-19. Of the five patients, three underwent BAL testing based on high clinical suspicion for COVID-19 after the nasopharyngeal (NP) swab(s) was negative. All three patients had underlying cancers and had lymphopenia for a considerable duration prior to being diagnosed with COVID-19. Two patients had better outcomes that could be attributed to earlier BAL specimen testing resulting in timely medical intervention. CONCLUSION: This study underscores the need for early lower respiratory tract sampling, whenever possible, in patients with cancer and prolonged lymphopenia. High clinical suspicion ought to supersede false-negative NP reverse transcriptase-PCR as early bronchoscopic evaluation in cancer patients, who are either receiving active treatment or are immunosuppressed, can allow timely institution of efficacious treatment, enrollment into clinical trials, as well as effective infection control. In the apt clinical setting in patients with cancer, presumptive treatment may also be considered to minimize exposure to healthcare providers and proceduralists.","Abid, Muhammad Bilal; Chhabra, Saurabh; Buchan, Blake; Graham, Mary Beth; Abedin, Sameem; Thapa, Bicky; D039,; Souza, Anita; George, Ben; Hamadani, Mehdi",Hematol. oncol. stem cell ther,,244

Most studies report clinical characteristics of hospitalized patients with COVID-19; the full spectrum of disease severity has thus not yet been well described. Methods: Using retrospective observational methods, this study analyzed factors affecting early clinical symptoms, clinical progress, and severity of disease for COVID-19 positive patients released from quarantine to provide information on establishing optimized care for new patients. The medical data of 7803 laboratory-confirmed patients who had been discharged or died by April 30, 2020 were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Findings: On admission, 7383 (94â¢5%) patients were asymptomatic or showed mild illness, and 372 (4â¢8%) patients were severe illness. Also, 48 (0 0â¢6%) were hospitalized with critically ill when diagnosed. Most patients with asymptomatic or mild illness on admission remained mild until discharge, 253 (3â¢4%) progressed to severe illness, and 83 (1â¢1%) died in hospital. However, the case fatality were 29â¢8% and 62â¢5% in severe and critically ill patients, respectively. At admission, 73â¢0% of hospitalized patients had symptoms; most common were cough (42â¢5%), sputum (28â¢8%), and fever (20â¢1%). Only 35â¢2% of laboratory confirmed patients admitted to the temporary care facility complained of symptoms. Increasing odds of being critically ill was associated with older age (OR 28â¢93, 95% CI 13â¢34-62â¢75 for age >70y, vs. age <50 y; p<0â¢0001), being male (OR 2â¢15, 95% CI1â¢59-2â¢89; p<0â¢0001), fever (OR 2â¢52, 95% CI 1.84-3â¢45; p<0â¢0001), and shortness of breath (OR 7â¢40, 95% CI 5â¢37-10â¢19; p<0â¢0001). Comorbid illness significantly increased risk of critical illness or death. Interpretation: Most cases were discharged as asymptomatic or recovered from mild illness, and only 9â¢7% developed severe disease requiring oxygen therapy or more. Case fatality rate was 2â¢9%, and markedly increased in those over age 50. Risk factors such as age, sex, fever, shortness of breath, and underlying disease can be useful in predicting future clinical severity.

280963,"High-resolution Chest CT Features and Clinical Characteristics of Patients Infected with COVID-19 in Jiangsu, China",2020,"Ultrafine particles (UFP;particulate matter &lt;0.1 μm diameter) emitted from motorized traffic may be highly detrimental to health. Active mobility (walking, bicycling) is increasingly encouraged as a way to reduce traffic congestion and increase physical activity levels. However, it has raised concerns of increased exposure to UFP, due to increased breathing rates in traffic microenvironments, immediately close to their source. The recent Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) societal closures reduced commuting needs, allowing a natural experiment to estimate contributions from motorized traffic to UFP exposure while walking or bicycling. From late-March to mid-July 2020, UFP was repeatedly measured while walking or bicycling, capturing local COVID-19 closure (‘Phase 0’) and subsequent phased re-opening (‘Phase 1, 2, 2.1 & 3’). A DiSCmini continuously measured particle number concentration (PNC) in the walker/bicyclist’s breathing zone. PNC while walking or bicycling was compared across phased re-openings and the effect of ambient temperature, wind speed and direction, was determined using regression models. Approximately 40 repeated 20-minute walking and bicycling laps were made over 4 months during societal re-opening phases related to the COVID-19 pandemic, from late March to mid July 2020 in Copenhagen. Highest median PNC exposure of both walking (13,170 pt/cm3, standard deviation (SD): 3560 pt/cm3) and bicycling (21,477 pt/cm3, SD: 8964) was seen during societal closures (Phase 0) and decreased to 5,367 pt/cm3 (SD: 2949) and 8,714 pt/cm3 (SD: 4309) in Phase 3 of re-opening. These reductions in PNC were mainly explained by meteorological conditions, with most of the deviation explained by wind speed (14–22%) and temperature (13–10%). Highest PNC was observed along major roads and intersections. In conclusion, we observed decreases in UFP exposure while walking and bicycling during societal re-opening phases related to the COVID-19 pandemic, due largely to meteorological factors (e.g., wind speed and temperature) and seasonal variations in UFP levels.","Bergmann, M.

284310,Nested matched case control study for the Japan Fukushima Health Management Survey's first full-scale (second-round) thyroid examination,2020,"Presented here is the design of the Mechanical Ventilator Milano (MVM), a novel mechanical ventilator designed for rapid mass production in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to address the urgent shortage of intensive therapy ventilators in many countries, and the growing difficulty in procuring these devices through normal supply chains across borders. This ventilator is an electro-mechanical equivalent of the old and reliable Manley Ventilator, and is able to operate in both pressure-controlled and pressure-supported ventilation modes. MVM is optimized for the COVID-19 emergency, thanks to the collaboration with medical doctors in the front line. MVM is designed for large-scale production in a short amount of time and at a limited cost, as it relays on off-the-shelf components, readily available worldwide. Operation of the MVM requires only a source of compressed oxygen (or compressed medical air) and electrical power. Initial tests of a prototype device with a breathing simulator are also presented. Further tests and developments are underway. At this stage the MVM is not yet a certified medical device but certification is in progress.","Galbiati, C.; Abba, A.; Agnes, P.; Amaudruz, P.; Arba, M.; Ardellier-Desages, F.; Badia, C.; Batignani, G.; Bellani, G.; Bianchi, G.; Bishop, D.; Bocci, V.; Bonivento, W.; Bottino, B.; Bouchard, M.; Brice, S.; Buccino, G.; Bussino, S.; Caminata, A.; Capra, A.; Caravati, M.; Carlini, M.; Carrozzi, L.; Cela, J.

284637,Case report: a fatal combination of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis with extensive pulmonary microvascular damage in COVID-19 pneumonia,2020,"The virtual practice has made major advances in the way that we care for patients in the modern era. The culture of virtual practice, consulting, and telemedicine, which had started several years ago, took an accelerated leap as humankind was challenged by the novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID19). The social distancing measures and lockdowns imposed in many countries left medical care providers with limited options in evaluating ambulatory patients, pushing the rapid transition to assessments via virtual platforms. In this novel arena of medical practice, which may form new norms beyond the current pandemic crisis, we found it critical to define guidelines on the recommended practice in neurotology, including remote methods in examining the vestibular and eye movement function. The proposed remote examination methods aim to reliably diagnose acute and subacute diseases of the inner-ear, brainstem, and the cerebellum. A key aim was to triage patients into those requiring urgent emergency room assessment versus non-urgent but expedited outpatient management. Physicians who had expertise in managing patients with vestibular disorders were invited to participate in the taskforce. The focus was on two topics: (1) an adequate eye movement and vestibular examination strategy using virtual platforms and (2) a decision pathway providing guidance about which patient should seek urgent medical care and which patient should have non-urgent but expedited outpatient management.","Shaikh, Aasef G; Bronstein, Adolfo; Carmona, Sergio; Cha, Yoon-Hee; Cho, Catherine; Ghasia, Fatema F; Gold, Daniel; Green, Kemar E; Helmchen, Christoph; Ibitoye, Richard T; Kattah, Jorge; Kim, Ji-Soo; Kothari, Sudhir; Manto, Mario; Seemungal, Barry M; Straumann, Dominik; Strupp, Michael; Szmulewicz, David; Tarnutzer, Alexander; Tehrani, Ali; Tilikete, Caroline; Welgampola, Miriam; Zalazar, Guillermo; Kheradmand, Amir",Cerebellum,,244
285630,"Dietitian-led Mediterranean diet program leads to weight loss, diet change, and reduction in waist circumference in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease",2020,The COVID-19 pandemic closed university campuses forcing rapid improvisation and adoption of online teaching. This paper explores the experience of converting three modules from proximate to online learning delivery in March and May 2020. This process was facilitated by reflective practice to support a process of improvisation as a buffering response to the pandemic. This paper distinguishes between the development of Distance Learning programmes compared to rapid adoption of online learning. Shifting to complete online teaching involves a process by which the lecturer’s role transitions towards the curation of online and offline student experiences. This includes facilitating and blending extensive and intensive online learning experiences. Extensive involves the selection and curation of online learning support bundles. This requires the creation of learning roadmaps to facilitate student learning. Intensive revolves around online engagement between academics and students and takes two forms: shallow as involving a limited dialogue with students and deep which involves a co-creation process between students and lecturers. Online learning provides opportunities to adapt learning experiences in real-time. The paper evaluates the shift to online practice from the students’ and academics’ perspectives.,"Bryson, John R.; Andres, Lauren",J. Geogr. High. Educ.,,244

Unexplored, however, is how sex and race interact in COVID-19 outcomes. OBJECTIVE: Use available data to characterize COVID-19 mortality rates within and between race and sex strata in two US states, with the aim of understanding how apparent sex disparities in COVID-19 deaths vary across race. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: This observational study uses COVID-19 mortality data through September 21, 2020, from Georgia (GA) and Michigan (MI). MAIN MEASURES: We calculate age-specific rates for each sex-race-age stratum, and age-standardized rates for each race-sex stratum. We investigate the sex disparity within race groups and the race disparity within sex groups using age-standardized rate ratios, and rate differences. KEY RESULTS: Within race groups, men have a higher COVID-19 mortality rate than women. Black men have the highest rate of all race-sex groups (in MI: 254.6, deaths per 100,000, 95% CI: 241.1-268.2, in GA:128.5, 95% CI: 121.0-135.9). In MI, the COVID-19 mortality rate for Black women (147.1, 95% CI: 138.7-155.4) is higher than the rate for white men (39.1, 95% CI: 37.3-40.9), white women (29.7, 95% CI: 28.3-31.0), and Asian/Pacific Islander men and women.

286788,Lower continuous venovenous hemodialysis replacement rate and its effect on patient outcome in the COVID crisis time,2020,"BackgroundSocial and structural determinants of health (SDOH) are the conditions in which individuals are born, live, learn, work, play, worship, and age. These drivers of health are integral in contextualizing the understanding and prevention of sport and recreation injury (SRI), and recognizing their impact is necessary to provide a complete and accurate picture of health and health outcomes related to injury.MainReducing disparities and achieving equity in sports and recreation is possible in part by improving data collection methodologies and utilization. Often, many SDOH have considerable effect on SRI. Although SRI epidemiology frequently examines differences by sex, there is limited inclusion of factors such as socioeconomic status, housing, gender, and food security, in sport specific data sources or in analysis of sport recreation and injury using other sources (e.g. administrative data). The ongoing dual epidemics in the United States – racism and COVID-19 – have emphasized the importance of having and utilizing SDOH data to reduce the burden of injury and disproportionate effects on our diverse population.ConclusionMoving forward, to address disparities in SRI, SDOH must be included as a part of research priorities, health related goals, and policies. This difference can be made in developing consistency in data collection and utilization. This will provide an accurate picture of the intersections and interdisciplinary changes required to design the best approach to problems to develop solutions. Future data collection and utilization should prioritize SDOH.","Baker, Charlotte Oziomachukwu Chinaka Stewart Elizabeth C.",Injury Epidemiology,,244
287301,Acute hypothermia in Covid 19: A case report,2020,"Purpose The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the social and cognitive underpinnings of miscommunication during an interactive listening task. Method An eye and computer mouse-tracking visual-world paradigm was used to investigate how a listener's cognitive effort (local and global) and decision-making processes were affected by a speaker's use of ambiguity that led to a miscommunication. Results Experiments 1 and 2 found that an environmental cue that made a miscommunication more or less salient impacted listener language processing effort (eye-tracking). Experiment 2 also indicated that listeners may develop different processing heuristics dependent upon the speaker's use of ambiguity that led to a miscommunication, exerting a significant impact on cognition and decision making. We also found that perspective-taking effort and decision-making complexity metrics (computer mouse tracking) predict language processing effort, indicating that instances of miscommunication produced cognitive consequences of indecision, thinking, and cognitive pull. Conclusion Together, these results indicate that listeners behave both reciprocally and adaptively when miscommunications occur, but the way they respond is largely dependent upon the type of ambiguity and how often it is produced by the speaker.","Roche, Jennifer M; Zgonnikov, Arkady; Morett, Laura M",J Speech Lang Hear Res,,244

To assess the telehealth implementation experiences of ambulatory personnel in different disciplines and their perspectives on potential telehealth disparities, and to make recommendations for more equitable telehealth delivery. We used a convergent parallel mixed-methods design. Clinic managers from geriatric medicine, internal medicine, and psychiatry e-mailed a survey to clinicians and staff regarding experiences with telehealth care delivery. Quantitative survey responses were analyzed with Fisher's Exact tests. Qualitative responses were coded thematically. Recommendations were categorized by type of implementation strategy. Quantitative and qualitative findings on telehealth disparities were merged in a joint data display. Respondents (n = 147, 57% response rate) were distributed across three specialties: 66% internal medicine, 19% psychiatry, and 14% geriatric medicine. Prior to 2020, 77% of clinicians had never delivered telehealth services. By Spring 2020, 78% reported conducting more than half of clinic visits by telehealth. Among clinicians, 52% agreed/strongly agreed that rapid telehealth implementation exacerbated access to care disparities to: older adult patients, those with limited internet access, and those needing interpretation services. Staff expressed similar difficulties with telehealth set-up especially for these patients. To improve telehealth equity, clinicians recommended to: (i) change infrastructure; (ii) train and educate stakeholders; and (iii) support clinicians. Clinicians and staff reported specific subpopulations had challenges in accessing telehealth visits. To avoid perpetuating telehealth access disparities, further co-discovery of equitable implementation strategies with patients and clinics are urgently needed.","Phimphasone-Brady, P; Chiao, J; Karamsetti, L; Sieja, A; Johnson, R; Macke, L; Lum, H; Lee, R; Farro, S; Loeb, D; Schifeling, C; Huebschmann, A G",Transl Behav Med,,244

However, prolonged wearing of protective respirators, medical and fabric masks can easily generate excessive sweating, moisture and friction. Closed and warm environments heighten the skin's permeability and sensitivity to physical or chemical irritants, leading to chronic cumulative irritant contact dermatitis or, rarely, even allergic contact dermatitis. Although not representing a life-threatening condition, contact dermatitis can have a significant impact on emergency management, as it is potentially able to reduce work performance and create emotional discomfort due to the involvement of evident body areas. To minimize the skin breakdown, adherence to standards on wearing protective and safe equipments and avoidance of overprotection should be performed. At the same time, some measures of skin care are recommended. Here, we offer some tips on how to prevent and manage contact dermatitis due to masks not only in health care workers, but also in the general population during this COVID-19 outbreak.","Di Altobrando, Ambra; La Placa, Michelangelo; Neri, Iria; Piraccini, Bianca Maria; Vincenzi, Colombina",Dermatol Ther,,244

METHODS: Outpatient and inpatient data from the neurology department were extracted from the electronic medical record system of three tertiary Grade A hospitals in Wenzhou. Data were analyzed across 5 months following the beginning of the pandemic (from January 13 to May 17) and compared with the same period in 2019. Data on reperfusion therapy for acute infarction stroke were extracted monthly from January to April. RESULTS: The number of outpatients declined from 102,300 in 2019 to 75,154 in 2020 (26.54%), while the number of inpatients in the three tertiary Grade A hospitals decreased from 4641 to 3437 (25.94%). The latter trend showed a significant drop from the 3rd week to the 7th week. The number of patients in these hospitals decreased significantly, and a significant drop was seen in the neurology department. As usual, stroke was the most common disease observed; however, anxiety/depression and insomnia increased dramatically in the outpatient consultation department. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study revealed the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in the clinical practice of neurology in Wenzhou during the outbreak. Understanding the pandemic's trends and impact on neurological patients and health systems will allow for better preparation of neurologists in the future.","Cao, Yun-Gang; Li, Yan; Shen, Jie; Shao, Meng-Meng; Lin, Xian-Da; Zhu, Juan-Juan; Huang, Xiao-Yan; Cheng, Zi-Cheng; Yan, Jue-Yue; Chen, Ke-Yang",Neurol. sci,,244
289083,Renal Morphology in Coronavirus Disease: A Literature Review,2021,"BACKGROUND: Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a devastating disease characterized by remodeling of lung architecture and abnormal deposition of fibroblasts in parenchymal tissue and ultimately results in respiratory failure and death. Preclinical studies suggest that mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) administration may be a safe and promising option in treating PF. The objective of our meta-analysis is to assess the efficacy of MSC therapy in preclinical models of PF. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive literature search in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases from inception to March 17, 2021. Studies that assessed the efficacy of MSC therapy to animals with PF were included. The SYRCLE bias risk tool was employed to evaluate the bias of included studies. The primary outcomes included survival rate and pulmonary fibrosis scores. Meta-analysis was conducted via Cochrane Collaboration Review Manager (version 5.4) and Stata 14.0 statistical software. RESULTS: A total of 1120 articles were reviewed, of which 24 articles met inclusion criteria. Of these, 12 studies evaluated the survival rate and 20 studies evaluated pulmonary fibrosis scores. Compared to the control group, MSC therapy was associated with an improvement in survival rate (odds ratios (OR) 3.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.06 to 4.67, P < 0.001, I2 = 0%) and a significant reduction in pulmonary fibrosis scores (weighted mean difference (WMD) 2.05, 95% CI -2.58 to -1.51, P < 0.001, I2 = 90%). CONCLUSIONS: MSC therapy is a safe and effective method that can significantly improve the survival and pulmonary fibrosis of PF animals. These results provide an important basis for future translational clinical studies.","Li, Deng-Yuan; Li, Ru-Fang; Sun, Dan-Xiong; Pu, Dan-Dan; Zhang, Yun-Hui",Stem Cell Res Ther,,244

289536,Guillain–Barré Syndrome as a Neurological Complication of COVID-19 Infection: A Case Series and Review of the Literature,2020,"BACKGROUND: The impact of statins on COVID-19 outcomes is important given the high prevalence of their use among individuals at risk for severe COVID-19. Our aim is to assess whether patients receiving chronic statin treatment who are hospitalized with COVID-19 have reduced in-hospital mortality if statin therapy is maintained during hospitalization. METHODS: This work is a cross-sectional, observational, retrospective multicenter study that analyzed 2921 patients who required hospital admission at 150 Spanish centers included in the nationwide SEMI-COVID-19 Network. We compared the clinical characteristics and COVID-19 disease outcomes between patients receiving chronic statin therapy who maintained this therapy during hospitalization versus those who did not. Propensity score matching was used to match each statin user whose therapy was maintained during hospitalization to a statin user whose therapy was withdrawn during hospitalization. RESULTS: After propensity score matching, continuation of statin therapy was associated with lower all-cause mortality (OR 0.67, 0.54-0.83, p < 0.001); lower incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) (OR 0.76,0.6-0.97, p = 0.025), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (OR 0.78, 0.69- 0.89, p < 0.001), and sepsis (4.82% vs 9.85%, p = 0.008); and less need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) (5.35% vs 8.57, p < 0.001) compared to patients whose statin therapy was withdrawn during hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Patients previously treated with statins who are hospitalized for COVID-19 and maintain statin therapy during hospitalization have a lower mortality rate than those in whom therapy is withdrawn. In addition, statin therapy was associated with a decreased probability that patients with COVID-19 will develop AKI, ARDS, or sepsis and decreases the need for IMV.","Torres-Peña, José David; Pérez-Belmonte, Luis M; Fuentes-Jiménez, Francisco; López Carmona, Mª Dolores; Pérez-Martinez, Pablo; López-Miranda, José; Carrasco Sánchez, Francisco Javier; Vargas Núñez, Juan Antonio; Del Corral Beamonte, Esther; Magallanes Gamboa, Jeffrey Oskar; González García, Andrés; González Moraleja, Julio; Cortés Troncoso, Andrés; Taboada Martínez, María Luisa; Del Fidalgo Montero, María Del Pilar; Seguí Ripol, José Miguel; Gil Sánchez, Ricardo; Alegre González, Diana; Boixeda, Ramon; Cortés Rodríguez, Begoña; Ena, Javier; García García, Gema María; Ventura Esteve, Ana; Ramos Rincón, José Manuel; Gómez-Huelgas, Ricardo",Drugs,,244

Currently, everyone in Europe is covered by GDPR. Thus, the medical practice also requires access to patient data in a safe and secure way. METHODS: Holographic technology allows users to see everything visible ona computer screen in a new and less restricted way, i. e. without the limitations of traditional computers and screens. RESULTS: In this study, a three-dimensional holographic doctors' assistant is designed and implemented in a way that meets the GDPR requirements. The HoloView application, which is tailored to run on Microsoft HoloLens, is proposed toallow display and access to personal data and so-called sensitive information of all individual patients without the risk that it will be presented to unauthorized persons. CONCLUSIONS: To enhance the user experience and remain consistent with GSPR, a holographic desk is proposed that allows displaying patient data and sensitive information only in front of the doctor's eyes using mixed reality glasses.

OBJECTIVE: The goal of this retrospective study of patients who tested positive with COVID-19 and were treated at NYU (New York University) Langone Health was to identify clinical markers predictive of disease severity in order to assist in clinical decision triage and to provide additional biological insights into disease progression. METHODS: The clinical activity of 3740 patients at NYU Langone Hospital was obtained between January and August 2020; patient data were deidentified. Models were trained on clinical data during different parts of their hospital stay to predict three clinical outcomes: deceased, ventilated, or admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). RESULTS: The XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) model that was trained on clinical data from the final 24 hours excelled at predicting mortality (area under the curve [AUC]=0.92; specificity=86%; and sensitivity=85%). Respiration rate was the most important feature, followed by SpO2 (peripheral oxygen saturation) and being aged 75 years and over. Performance of this model to predict the deceased outcome extended 5 days prior, with AUC=0.81, specificity=70%, and sensitivity=75%. When only using clinical data from the first 24 hours, AUCs of 0.79, 0.80, and 0.77 were obtained for deceased, ventilated, or ICU-admitted outcomes, respectively. Although respiration rate and SpO2 levels offered the highest feature importance, other canonical markers, including diabetic history, age, and temperature, offered minimal gain. When lab values were incorporated, prediction of mortality benefited the most from blood urea nitrogen and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Features that were predictive of morbidity included LDH, calcium, glucose, and C-reactive protein. CONCLUSIONS: Together, this work summarizes efforts to systematically examine the importance of a wide range of features across different endpoint outcomes and at different hospitalization time points.","Wang, Joshua M; Liu, Wenke; Chen, Xiaoshan; McRae, Michael P; McDevitt, John T; Fenyö, David",J Med Internet Res,,244

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted, and all COVID-19 patients were recruited who were admitted to the Yichang Third People's Hospital from February 1st to March 31st, 2020. One-to-one propensity score matching (PSM) was used for minimizing confounding effects. The primary outcome was hospital mortality, with the secondary outcomes being the time needed for a positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test to turn negative and the length of hospital stay. RESULTS: Totaling 367 patients with COVID-19 hospitalized at the Yichang Third People's Hospital were identified, of whom 276 were mild or stable COVID-19, and 67 were serious or critically ill. Among them, 255 patients were treated using methylprednisolone, and 188 did not receive any corticosteroid-related treatment. After PSM, no statistically significant difference was found in the baseline characteristics between the two groups. Regarding the outcomes, there also were no statistically significant difference between the two groups. Patients without the use of methylprednisolone were more quickly to obtain negative results of their nasopharyngeal swab tests of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid after treatment, compared to those receiving methylprednisolone. CONCLUSION: Methylprednisolone could not improve the prognosis of patients with COVID-19, and the efficacy and safety of the use of methylprednisolone in patients with COVID-19 still remain uncertain, thus the use of corticosteroids clinically in patients with COVID-19 should be with cautions.","You, Xiang; Wu, Chao-Hui; Fu, Ya-Nan; He, Zonglin; Huang, Pin-Fang; Chen, Gong-Ping; Lin, Cui-Hong; Ming, Wai-Kit; Lin, Rong-Fang",PLoS One,,244

Although high rates of venous thromboembolism and evidence of COVID-19-induced endothelial dysfunction have been reported, the precise aetiology of the increased thrombotic risk associated with COVID-19 infection remains to be fully elucidated. Therefore, we assessed clinical platelet parameters and circulating platelet activity in patients with severe and nonsevere COVID-19. An assessment of clinical blood parameters in patients with severe COVID-19 disease (requiring intensive care), patients with nonsevere disease (not requiring intensive care), general medical in-patients without COVID-19, and healthy donors was undertaken. Platelet function and activity were also assessed by secretion and specific marker analysis. We demonstrated that routine clinical blood parameters including increased mean platelet volume (MPV) and decreased platelet:neutrophil ratio are associated with disease severity in COVID-19 upon hospitalisation and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Strikingly, agonist-induced ADP release was 30- to 90-fold higher in COVID-19 patients compared with hospitalised controls and circulating levels of platelet factor 4 (PF4), soluble P-selectin (sP-selectin), and thrombopoietin (TPO) were also significantly elevated in COVID-19. This study shows that distinct differences exist in routine full blood count and other clinical laboratory parameters between patients with severe and nonsevere COVID-19. Moreover, we have determined all COVID-19 patients possess hyperactive circulating platelets. These data suggest abnormal platelet reactivity may contribute to hypercoagulability in COVID-19 and confirms the role that platelets/clotting has in determining the severity of the disease and the complexity of the recovery path.","Comer, Shane P; Cullivan, Sarah; Szklanna, Paulina B; Weiss, Luisa; Cullen, Steven; Kelliher, Sarah; Smolenski, Albert; Murphy, Claire; Altaie, Haidar; Curran, John; O039,; Reilly, Katherine; Cotter, Aoife G; Marsh, Brian; Gaine, Sean; Mallon, Patrick; McCullagh, Brian; Moran, Niamh; Ní Áinle, Fionnuala; Kevane, Barry; Maguire, Patricia B",PLoS Biol,,244

This problem arises when only the population level counts of the number of individuals at each time step are available, from which one seeks to learn the individual hidden Markov model. Our algorithm is built upon expectation-maximization and the recently proposed aggregate inference algorithm, the Sinkhorn belief propagation. As compared with existing methods such as expectation-maximization with non-linear belief propagation, our algorithm exhibits convergence guarantees. Moreover, our learning framework naturally reduces to the standard Baum-Welch learning algorithm when observations corresponding to a single individual are recorded. We further extend our learning algorithm to handle HMMs with continuous observations. The efficacy of our algorithm is demonstrated on a variety of datasets.","Singh, Rahul; Zhang, Qinsheng; Chen, Yongxin",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.11236v1.pdf,244

Employing this premise in a comparative analysis, this work demonstrates a critical discontinuity in the epidemic imaginary that framed the Chinese as pathogenic. Consequently, those seeking to prevent future disease racialization must understand modern Sinophobia as fundamentally distinct from that of the past.","Zhang, Dennis",J Med Humanit,,244

During the spring of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic made patient travel to the hospital challenging and necessitated reduction in operative volume so that resources could be conserved. We report our experience with synchronous bilateral metastasectomies for the treatment of disease in both lungs. METHODS: Patients with bilateral pulmonary metastases who underwent simultaneous bilateral resections were compared with a cohort of patients who underwent staged resections. We used nearest-neighbor propensity score (1:1) matching to adjust for confounders. Perioperative outcomes were compared between groups using paired statistical analysis techniques. RESULTS: Between 1998 and 2020, 36 patients underwent bilateral simultaneous metastasectomies. We matched 31 pairs of patients. The length of stay was significantly shorter in patients undergoing simultaneous resection (median 3 vs. 8 days, p < .001) and operative time was shorter (156 vs. 235.5 min, p < .001) when compared to the sum of both procedures in the staged group. The groups did not significantly differ with regard to postoperative complications. CONCLUSION: In a carefully selected patient population, simultaneous bilateral metastasectomy is a safe option. A single procedure confers benefits for both the patient as well as the hospital resource system.","Feldman, Hope A; Zhou, Nicolas; Antonoff, Mara B; Hofstetter, Wayne L; Rajaram, Ravi; Rice, David C; Sepesi, Boris; Vaporciyan, Ara A; Zorrilla-Vaca, Andres; Mehran, Reza J",J Surg Oncol,,244

These are used as controls, and allow measurement and improvement of the accuracy and quality of diagnostic tests. Current reference standards typically represent target genetic material, and act only as positive controls to assess test sensitivity. However, negative controls are also required to evaluate test specificity. Using a pair of chimeric A/B RNA standards, this allowed incorporation of positive and negative controls into diagnostic testing for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The chimeric standards constituted target regions for RT-PCR primer/probe sets that are joined in tandem across two separate synthetic molecules. Accordingly, a target region that is present in standard A provides a positive control, whilst being absent in standard B, thereby providing a negative control. This design enables cross-validation of positive and negative controls between the paired standards in the same reaction, with identical conditions. This enables control and test failures to be distinguished, increasing confidence in the accuracy of results. The chimeric A/B standards were assessed using the US Centres for Disease Control real-time RT-PCR protocol, and showed results congruent with other commercial controls in detecting SARS-CoV-2 in patient samples. This chimeric reference standard design approach offers extensive flexibility, allowing representation of diverse genetic features and distantly related sequences, even from different organisms.","Madala, Bindu Swapna; Reis, Andre L M; Deveson, Ira W; Rawlinson, William; Mercer, Tim R",Sci Rep,,244

By combining k-mer embedding-based encoding, hierarchically organized CNNs, and carefully trained rejection layer, CHEER is able to assign correct taxonomic labels for reads from new species. We tested CHEER on both simulated and real sequencing data. The results show that CHEER can achieve higher accuracy than popular alignment-based and alignment-free taxonomic assignment tools.

Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has played a significant role in contributing to our understanding of the epidemiology and biology of this virus. In this paper, we investigate the use of SARS-CoV-2 WGS in Southeast and East Asia and the impact of technological development, access to resources, and demography of individual countries on its uptake. Using Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT), Nottingham-Indonesia Collaboration for Clinical Research and Training (NICCRAT) initiative has facilitated collaboration between the University of Nottingham and a team in Research Centre for Biotechnology, Indonesian Institute of Sciences (Lembaga Ilmu Pengetahuan Indonesia/LIPI) to carry out a small number of SARS-CoV-2 WGS in Indonesia. The ONT offers sequencing advantages that fit within the Indonesian context. Analyses of SARS-CoV-2 genomes deposited on GISAID from Southeast and East Asian countries reveal the importance of collecting clinical and demographic metadata and the importance of open access and data sharing. Lineage and phylogenetic analyses per 1 June 2021 found that: 1) B.1.466.2 variants were the most predominant in Indonesia, with mutations in the spike protein including D614G at 100%, N439K at 99.1%, and P681R at 69.7% frequency, 2) The variants of concern (VoCs) B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), and B.1.617.2 (Delta) were first detected in Indonesia in January 2021, 3) B.1.470 was first detected in Indonesia and spread to the neighbouring regions, and 4) The highest rate of virus transmissions between Indonesia and the rest of the world appears to be through interactions with Singapore and Japan, two neighbouring countries with a high degree of access and travels to and from Indonesia.","Cahyani, Inswasti; Putro, Eko W; Ridwanuloh, Asep M; Wibowo, Satrio; Hariyatun, Hariyatun; Syahputra, Gita; Akbariani, Gilang; Utomo, Ahmad R; Ilyas, Mohammad; Loose, Matthew W; Kusharyoto, Wien; Network, - Indonesian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Surveillance; Susanti, Susanti",,,244
302875,Understanding the Pathophysiological Changes Via Untargated Metabolomics in COVID-19 Patients,2020,"Selective inhibition of histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) prevents glucolipotoxicity-induced ß-cell dysfunction and apoptosis by alleviation of proapoptotic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-signaling, but the precise molecular mechanisms of alleviation are unexplored. By unbiased microarray analysis of the ß-cell gene expression profile of insulin-producing cells exposed to glucolipotoxicity in the presence or absence of a selective HDAC3 inhibitor, we identified Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) as the sole target candidate. ß-Cells were protected against glucolipotoxicity-induced ER stress and apoptosis by EZH2 attenuation. Small molecule inhibitors of EZH2 histone methyltransferase activity rescued human islets from glucolipotoxicity-induced apoptosis. Moreover, EZH2 knockdown cells were protected against glucolipotoxicity-induced downregulation of the protective non-canonical Nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells (NF&#954;B) pathway. We conclude that EZH2 deficiency protects from glucolipotoxicity-induced ER stress, apoptosis and downregulation of the non-canonical NF&#954;B pathway, but not from insulin secretory dysfunction. The mechanism likely involves transcriptional regulation via EZH2 functioning as a methyltransferase and/or as a methylation-dependent transcription factor.","Dahlby, Tina; Simon, Christian; Backe, Marie Balslev; Dahllöf, Mattias Salling; Holson, Edward; Wagner, Bridget K; Böni-Schnetzler, Marianne; Marzec, Michal Tomasz; Lundh, Morten; Mandrup-Poulsen, Thomas",,,244

There is limited data on pathogenesis and the cellular responses of COVID-19. In this study, it is aimed to determine the variation of metabolites between healthy control and COVID-19 via the untargeted metabolomics method. Serum samples were obtained from 44 COVID-19 patients and 41 healthy controls. Untargeted metabolomics analyses were performed by LC/Q-TOF/MS method. Data acquisition, classification, and identification were achieved by the METLIN database and XCMS. Significant differences were determined between patients and healthy controls in terms of purine, glutamine, leukotriene D4 (LTD4) and glutathione metabolisms. Down regulations were determined in R-S lactoglutathione and glutamine. Up-regulations were detected in hypoxanthine, inosine, and LTD4. Identified metabolites indicate roles for purine, glutamine, LTD4, and glutathione metabolisms in the pathogenesis of the COVID-19. The use of selective leukotriene D4 receptor antagonists, targeting purinergic signaling as a therapeutic approach and glutamine supplementation may decrease the severity and mortality of COVID-19.

307259,Improving Linkage to Care of Hepatitis C: Clinical Validation of GeneXpert® HCV Viral Load Point-of-Care Assay in Indonesia,2021,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory virus. Transmission occurs by droplets, contact and aerosols. In medical settings, filtering facepiece (FFP) respirators are recommended for use by personnel exposed to aerosol-generating procedures. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the demand for FFP respirators exceeded their supply worldwide and low-quality products appeared on the market, potentially putting healthcare workers at risk. AIMS: To raise awareness about variations in quality of imported FFP respirators in Switzerland during the COVID-19 pandemic, to draw attention to the current directives regulating the market launch of FFP respirators in Switzerland, to provide practical support in identifying suspicious products or documents and, finally, to offer strategies aimed at reducing the distribution of low-quality FFP respirators in the future. METHODS: Three Swiss laboratories, Spiez Laboratory and Unisant&eacute; in partnership with TOXpro SA individually set up testing procedures to evaluate aerosol penetration and fit testing of FFP respirators imported into Switzerland during COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, Spiez Laboratory visually inspected the products, examined the certification documents and crosschecked the product information with international databases. RESULTS: Between 31 March and 15 June 2020, 151 FFP respirators were analysed. The initial assessment performed before testing allowed a reduction of up to 35% in the number of FFP respirators sent to Spiez Laboratory for evaluation, for which product information found to be faulty. After filtration efficiency evaluation and fit testing, 52% and 60% of all products tested by Spiez Laboratory and Unisant&eacute;-TOXpro SA, respectively, did not meet the minimum performance requirements established independently by the three Swiss laboratories. CONCLUSION: The demand for FFP respirators exceeded the supply capacity from established suppliers of the Swiss market. New production and import channels emerged, as did the number of poor-quality FFP respirators. FFP respirators remaining in stocks should be checked for conformity before being used, or eliminated and replaced if quality does not meet standards.","Delaloye, Jean-Romain; Vernez, David; Suarez, Guillaume; de Courten, Damien; Zingg, Walter; Perret, Vincent; Metzger, César M J A; Richner, Gilles",Swiss Med Wkly,,244

We document levels and predictors of U.S. parents who newly allowed adolescents to drink alcohol at home during the shutdown. METHODS: Participants in an ongoing longitudinal study were two adolescent siblings (N = 911, M = 14.43, SD = 1.54 years) and one parent (N = 456; 85% mothers) who provided self-report data before the pandemic (T1) and during the shutdown. RESULTS: No parents permitted adolescent drinking with family at T1; nearly one in six allowed it during the shutdown. In full models, adolescents who previously drank (without permission) and had light or heavy drinking parents were more likely to be newly permitted to drink. CONCLUSIONS: Parents' alcohol permissibility within family contexts changed during the pandemic and was shaped by both parent and adolescent drinking. Well-child visits should continue adolescent alcohol screening and parent support during and after the pandemic.","Maggs, Jennifer L; Cassinat, Jenna R; Kelly, Brian C; Mustillo, Sarah A; Whiteman, Shawn D",J Adolesc Health,,244

Utilizing the ORBIT model for behavioral intervention development, we defined and refined a behavioral intervention for providers, Tailored Motivational Interviewing (TMI), to improve provider competence in previous studies (Phase 1a and 1b). The current study focuses on ORBIT Phase 2a-proof of concept. We hypothesized that TMI would be acceptable and feasible and would show a signal of efficacy of improving and maintaining community health worker (CHW) MI competence scores using an innovative statistical method for small N proof-of-concept studies. Method: Longitudinal data were collected from 19 CHWs at 16 youth HIV agencies. CHWs from 8 sites were assigned to the TMI group per the cofunders request. The remaining 8 sites were randomly assigned to TMI or services as usual. MI competence was assessed at baseline and up to 15 times over 2 years. Random coefficient models were utilized to examine time trajectories of competence scores and the impact of the intervention on competence trajectories. Semistructured interviews were conducted to determine barriers and facilitators of TMI. Results: Competence scores in the TMI group significantly increased while the scores of the control group significantly decreased. Further analysis of the intervention group demonstrated that scores significantly increased during the first 3 months after initial workshop and was sustained through the end of the study. Qualitative findings revealed insufficient time and competing priorities as perceived barriers whereas integrating MI into routine agency practices and ongoing training might facilitate implementation. Conclusions: Following a successful proof-of-concept, the next step is a fully randomized pilot study of TMI relative to a control condition in preparation for a stepped-wedge cluster randomized full scale trial.

311203,Immunogenicity of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in heart transplant recipients - a prospective cohort study,2021,"On a global scale, the epidemic of the novel coronavirus (NCOV-2019) has become a major issue that is seriously harming human health and impairing the environment's quality. The current study examines the association between air pollution and NCOV-2019 in China, where cases of NCOV-2019 are correlated with deaths in public databases with data on air pollution tracked at multiple locations in different provinces of China. A negative binomial regression (NBR) model was applied to examine the difference between the number of people infected with NCOV-2019 and the number of deaths in China. The findings show that, after population density regulation, there is a positive connection between air pollutants concentration (particularly nitrogen dioxide) and the number of NCOV-2019 cases and deaths. Furthermore, PM2.5 is the key cause of NCOV-2019 cases and deaths in China. The results indicate that a 1% increase in the average of PM2.5 was correlated with an increase of 11.67 % in NCOV-2019 cases and a rise of 18 % in NCOV-2019 deaths. We concluded that a slight rise in air pollution has caused the number of NCOV-2019 cases and deaths to increase dramatically.

Through new insights into the manifold geometry underlying a generic latent position model, we show that this can be accomplished in two steps: matrix factorisation, followed by nonlinear dimension reduction. This combination is effective because the point cloud obtained in the first step lives close to a manifold in which latent distance is encoded as geodesic distance. Hence, a nonlinear dimension reduction tool, approximating geodesic distance, can recover the latent positions, up to a simple transformation. We give a detailed account of the case where spectral embedding is used, followed by Isomap, and provide encouraging experimental evidence for other combinations of techniques.","Whiteley, Nick; Gray, Annie; Rubin-Delanchy, Patrick",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.01260v1.pdf,244

315273,Additional diagnostic accuracy of global longitudinal strain at peak dobutamine stress in patients with moderate pretest probability of coronary artery disease,2020,"The idea of a network of small devices that would be able to connect each other, appeared in the early 80s. In a prophetic article, Mark Weiser,1 described such a connection, that it is now known under the term of Internet of Things (IoT). In a broadest sense, the term IoT encompasses everything connected to the internet, but it is increasingly being used to define objects that ""talk"" to each other, creating a network from simple sensors to smartphones and wearables connected. During the recent years this network of communicating devices has been combined with other technological achievements, and particularly with the Virtual Reality (VR)2 and the Artificial Intelligence (AI).3 The emerge of COVID-19 pandemic in 2019, resulted to the poor response and healthcare failures of many countries globally.4 One of the main reasons for such a failure, was the inability of accurate data collection from different sources. Apparently, it was the first time, humanity realized the need for massive amounts of heterogeneous data to be collected, interpreted, and shared. Amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, several innovators and public authorities are looking to leverage IoT tools to reduce the burden on the healthcare systems.5 Mental health is one of the areas that seems to benefit the most of such technologies. A significant decrease of the total amount of ER visits and a dramatic increase of internet access from the patients and care givers along to the development of applications for mental health issues, followed the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.6 Such technologies proved to be efficient to help mentally ill patients and pioneer the path in the future. Probably the most obvious use of these emerged technologies is the improvement of the telehealth options. Patients who suffer from mental illness face significant problems towards the continuity of care during the crisis.7 Nonetheless, they usually have other health problems, that deprive them from an equitable health care provision. Improved telehealth platforms can give them a single point access to address all their problems. The use of electronic health records can reduce the fragmentary health services and improve the outcome.8 However, this is only the beginning. The COVID-19 crisis and the subsequent social isolation, to reduce both the contamination and the spread of the disease, highlighted the necessity for providing accurate and secure diagnoses and treatments from a safe distance. Virtual reality combined with IoT and AI technologies seem to be a reliable alternative to the classic physical and mental examination and treatment in many areas of mental and neurological diseases.2 These novel techniques can spot the early signs and detect mental illnesses with high accuracy. However, caution and more work are required to bridge the space between these recently thrived technologies and mental health care.7 It is worth mentioning, that internet-oriented health care procedures can also help to reduce the gaps caused by the stigma of mental illness. For example, the development of AI chatbots (an application used to chat directly with a human) can alleviate the fears of judgment of the help seeking persons and provide the professionals with a supplemental support toward improved services to their patients.9 A final remark for conclusion. Humanity is more and more depended to the ""intelligent"" machines. However, we must not forget that we humans are responsible to set the rules of such co-existence.","Alevizopoulos, Aristomenis; Kritikos, Jacob; Alevizopoulos, Georgios",,,244
315538,Characteristics and Outcomes of IBD Patients with COVID-19 on Tofacitinib Therapy in the SECURE-IBD Registry,2020,"The pathogenesis of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is gradually being comprehended. A high number of thrombotic episodes are reported, along with the mortality benefits of heparin. COVID-19 can be viewed as a prothrombotic disease. We overviewed the available evidence to explore this possibility. We identified various histopathology reports and clinical case series reporting thromboses in COVID-19. Also, multiple coagulation markers support this. COVID-19 can be regarded as a risk factor for thrombosis. Applying the principles of Virchow's triad, we described abnormalities in the vascular endothelium, altered blood flow, and platelet function abnormalities that lead to venous and arterial thromboses in COVID-19. Endothelial dysfunction, activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) with the release of procoagulant plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1), and hyperimmune response with activated platelets seem to be significant contributors to thrombogenesis in COVID-19. Stratifying risk of COVID-19 thromboses should be based on age, presence of comorbidities, D-dimer, CT scoring, and various blood cell ratios. Isolated heparin therapy may not be sufficient to combat thrombosis in this disease. There is an urgent need to explore newer avenues like activated protein C, PAI-1 antagonists, and tissue plasminogen activators (tPA). These should be augmented with therapies targeting RAAS, antiplatelet drugs, repurposed antiinflammatory, and antirheumatic drugs. Key Points â¢ Venous and arterial thromboses in COVID-19 can be viewed through the prism of Virchow's triad. â¢ Endothelial dysfunction, platelet activation, hyperviscosity, and blood flow abnormalities due to hypoxia, immune reactions, and hypercoagulability lead to thrombogenesis in COVID-19. â¢ There is an urgent need to stratify COVID-19 patients at risk for thrombosis using age, comorbidities, D-dimer, and CT scoring. â¢ Patients with COVID-19 at high risk for thrombosis should be put on high dose heparin therapy.","Ahmed, Sakir; Zimba, Olena; Gasparyan, Armen Yuri",Clin Rheumatol,,244

DESIGN: Online survey using a snowball sampling approach. SETTING: Practitioners working in hospitals, hospices, care homes and community settings across the UK and Ireland. PARTICIPANTS: Health and social care professionals involved in bereavement support. INTERVENTIONS: Brief online survey distributed widely across health and social care organisations. RESULTS: 805 respondents working in hospice, community, and hospital settings across the UK and Ireland completed the survey between 3 August and 4 September 2020. Changes to bereavement care practice were reported in: the use of telephone, video and other forms of remote support (90%); supporting people bereaved from non-COVID conditions (76%), from COVID-19 (65%) and people bereaved before the pandemic (61%); funeral arrangements (61%); identifying bereaved people who might need support (56%); managing complex forms of grief (48%) and access to specialist services (41%). Free-text responses demonstrated the complexities and scale of the impact on health and social care services, practitioners and their relationships with bereaved families, and on bereaved people. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic has created major challenges for the support of bereaved people: increased needs for bereavement care, transition to remote forms of support and the stresses experienced by practitioners, among others. The extent to which services are able to adapt, meet the escalating level of need and help to prevent a 'tsunami of grief' remains to be seen.

Moreover, recovery, death, immunity and all aforementioned parameters are modeled on the high-dimensional space. To epitomize the capabilities and features of the above framework, prognostic estimates of Covid-19 spread using a six-dimensional (time, 2D space, infection severity, duration of infection, and population age) PBE is presented. Further, scenario analysis for different policy interventions and population behavior is presented, throwing more insights into the spatio-temporal spread of infections across duration of disease, infection severity and age of the population. These insights could be used for science-informed policy planning.","Ganesan, Sashikumaar; Subramani, Deepak",Sci Rep,,244
320594,Case Report: Emergency CABG Following Failure of PTCA in a COVID-19 Patient,2020,"The role of geospatial disparities in the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic is poorly understood. We developed a spatially-explicit mathematical model to simulate transmission dynamics of COVID-19 disease infection in relation with the uneven distribution of the healthcare capacity in Ohio, U.S. The results showed substantial spatial variation in the spread of the disease, with localized areas showing marked differences in disease attack rates. Higher COVID-19 attack rates experienced in some highly connected and urbanized areas (274 cases per 100,000 people) could substantially impact the critical health care response of these areas regardless of their potentially high healthcare capacity compared to more rural and less connected counterparts (85 cases per 100,000). Accounting for the spatially uneven disease diffusion linked to the geographical distribution of the critical care resources is essential in designing effective prevention and control programmes aimed at reducing the impact of COVID-19 pandemic.","Cuadros, Diego F; Xiao, Yanyu; Mukandavire, Zindoga; Correa-Agudelo, Esteban; Hernández, Andrés; Kim, Hana; MacKinnon, Neil J",Health Place,,244

321432,Myasthenia gravis and arrhythmias in COVID-19: a case report,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic led to development of mRNA vaccines, which became a leading anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunization platform. Preclinical studies are limited to infection-prone animals such as hamsters and monkeys in which protective efficacy of vaccines cannot be fully appreciated. We recently reported a SARS-CoV-2 human Fc-conjugated receptor-binding domain (RBD-hFc) mRNA vaccine delivered via lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). BALB/c mice demonstrated specific immunologic responses following RBD-hFc mRNA vaccination. Now, we evaluated the protective effect of this RBD-hFc mRNA vaccine by employing the K18 human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (K18-hACE2) mouse model. Administration of an RBD-hFc mRNA vaccine to K18-hACE2 mice resulted in robust humoral responses comprising binding and neutralizing antibodies. In correlation with this response, 70% of vaccinated mice withstood a lethal SARS-CoV-2 dose, while all control animals succumbed to infection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first nonreplicating mRNA vaccine study reporting protection of K18-hACE2 against a lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Elia, Uri; Rotem, Shahar; Bar-Haim, Erez; Ramishetti, Srinivas; Naidu, Gonna Somu; Gur, David; Aftalion, Moshe; Israeli, Ma039; ayan,; Bercovich-Kinori, Adi; Alcalay, Ron; Makdasi, Efi; Chitlaru, Theodor; Rosenfeld, Ronit; Israely, Tomer; Melamed, Sharon; Abutbul Ionita, Inbal; Danino, Dganit; Peer, Dan; Cohen, Ofer",Nano lett,,244

326281,The diagnostic value of platelet distribution width in patients with mild COVID-19,2021,"PURPOSE: To investigate the adherence rate of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) patients in treat-and-extend (TAE) protocol to their anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) intravitreal injection (IVI) appointments and to evaluate the functional and anatomical outcomes of the patients who attended and did not attend their IVI appointments during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) restriction period (RP). METHODS: The patients with nAMD having IVI appointments between March 16 and June 1, 2020 (RP in Turkey) were included in this retrospective study. For adherence analysis, the patients who attended (Group 1, n = 44) and who did not attend (Group 2, n = 60) their IVI appointment visits during the RP (VRP) were evaluated according to their last visit before the RP (V0). For outcome analysis, the patients who attend VRP and have follow-up (Group 1a, 46 eyes) and who did not attend VRP but later attended for follow-up (Group 2a, 33 eyes) were evaluated for functional (best-corrected visual acuity, BCVA [logMAR]) and anatomical (optical coherence tomography [OCT] disease activity) outcomes at the first visit after RP (V1) and last visit within six months after RP (V2). Patients received a complete ophthalmologic evaluation with anti-VEGF (Aflibercept) IVI administration at all visits. RESULTS: The adherence rate of the patients to VRP was 42.3% (44/104). The patients in Group 1 were significantly younger (mean ± SD years, 71.0 ± 8.1 vs. 74.7 ± 8.0, p = 0.024), had better median [IQR] BCVA at their first presentation (0.30 [0.54] vs. 0.61 [1.08], p = 0.023) and V0 (0.40 [0.48] vs. 0.52 [0.70], p = 0.031), and had less hypertension (36.4% vs. 58.3%, p = 0.044) than Group 2. The mean ± SD delay of planned IVI at VRP in Group 2a was 13.9 ± 6.2 weeks. Disease activity in OCT was significantly higher in Group 2a than Group 1a at V1 (60.6% vs. 32.6%, p = 0.025). In Group 2a, the median (IQR) BCVA was significantly worse at V1 (0.70 [0.58]) and V2 (0.70 [0.59]) than V0 (0.52 [0.40], p = 0.047 and p = 0.035, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: More than half of the scheduled nAMD patients in TAE protocol missed their IVI visits during the RP, which resulted in a delay of their treatments. The delay of IVI treatment in those patients resulted in an increase in OCT disease activity and a decrease in BCVA.","Sevik, Mehmet Orkun; Aykut, Aslan; Özkan, Gamze; Dericioglu, Volkan; Sahin, Özlem",Int. ophthalmol,,244

328462,Combination of convalescent plasma therapy and repurposed drugs to treat severe COVID-19 patient with multimorbidity,2021,"The emergence of COVID-19 took the world by shock in December 2019, starting from Wuhan, China and swiftly spreading across the globe. The number of COVID-19 cases continues to rise which is a global burden on the health care system worldwide. Efforts are continuing to come up with a solution either to develop a small molecular inhibitor or vaccine, but still no success. In the fight against SARS-CoV-2, targeting a different protein of the SARS-CoV-2 is the need of the hour to impede and relinquish the current pandemic. Therefore, in this study, computational modelling and simulation approaches are used to target the N-terminal domain of the phosphor-nucleoprotein (RNA binding protein), which is primarily responsible for binding and packing the viral genome to get ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP). Our multi-step drug screening approach shortlisted potential drugs. These top hits were confirmed by re-docking which revealed that the interacting molecules block the key residues i.e. Thr57, His59, Ser105, Arg107, and Arg177 and thus ultimately block the NTD from RNA recognition. Furthermore, the activity of the top four hits was also confirmed by using molecular dynamics simulation and free energy calculation. Our analysis suggests that these top hits possess strong inhibitory properties and should be tested experimentally. In conclusion, we hope these top hits would abrogate the binding of RNA and the NTD of the SARS-CoV-2, which might be helpful to combat COVID-19.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

With the continuing transmission of the virus worldwide and the rapidly evolving situation globally, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic in March. Currently, there is no proven specific treatment for this potentially deadly disease beyond supportive care. However, a massive effort has been put globally into the investigation of medications and other interventional measures to fight COVID-19. Convalescent plasma therapy from recovered patients has recently drawn considerable interest. Several alternative medical treatments, although evidence of their efficacy still lacking, have also gained popularity, especially in countries with such traditions such as India and China. Rapid repurposing of drugs for COVID-19 has revealed a few promising candidate antiviral agents, but further research, especially high quality randomized controlled trials, will be needed to prove their efficacy and safety in the clinical use to treat COVID-19. Vaccine development has been the imperative task in the battle against SARS-CoV-2. While clinical trials have been launched for several candidate vaccines, research on COVID-19 vaccines is still at an early stage. So far, optimized supportive care remains the best practice against COVID-19.","Jing, Ran; Vunnam, Rama Rao; Yang, Yuhong; Karevoll, Adam; Vunnam, Srinivas Rao",J. Pure Appl. Microbiol.,,244

The government has further directed school reopening under strict preventive measures. However, there is still considerable concern on the impact of school reopening on community transmission of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the appropriateness of these directives and the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections in children as compared to adults using sufficient national sample data. METHODS: In the present study, we evaluated the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pediatric patients as compared to adults by analyzing the length of hospital stays (LOS), medical expenses, and hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) admission rates. A multivariate linear regression analysis was carried out to examine the effects of COVID-19 patients that the characteristics on the LOS and medical expenses, and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed to identify COVID-19 characteristics that affect hospital and ICU admission rates and to prove the low SARS-CoV-2 infection severity in pediatric patients. RESULTS: The hospitalization period for children aged 0-9 was 37% shorter and that of patients aged 10-19 years was 31% shorter than those of older age groups (P < 0.001). The analysis of the medical expenses by age showed that on average, medical expenses for children were approximately 4,900 USD lower for children than for patients over 80 years of age. The linear regression analysis also showed that patients who were 0-9 years old spent 87% and those aged 10-19 118% less on medical expenses than those aged 70 and over, even after the correction of other variables (P < 0.001). The probability of hospitalization was the lowest at 10-19 years old (odds ratio [OR], 0.05; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.03-0.09), and their ICU admission rate was also the lowest at 0.14 (OR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.08-0.24). On the other hand, the likelihood of hospitalization and ICU admission was the highest in children aged 0-9 years, and among patients under the age of 50 years in general. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the low severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in younger patients (0-19 years) by analyzing the LOS, medical expenses, hospital, and intensive care unit admission rates as outcome variables. As the possibility to develop severe infection of coronavirus at the age of 10-19 was the lowest, a mitigation policy is also required for middle and high school students. In addition, children with underlying diseases need to be protected from high-risk infection environments.","Seon, Jeong Yeon; Jeon, Woo Hwi; Bae, Sang Cheol; Eun, Baik Lin; Choung, Ji Tae; Oh, In Hwan",J Korean Med Sci,,244

Because of teaching on the computer screen for a long period of time, the teacher lacks communication and can act casually. With long-term accumulation, the problem of teachers' job burnout has become increasingly serious. The main purpose of this study was to examine the influence of professional identity on job burnout during the period of the novel coronavirus. At the same time, this study also discussed the moderating effect of job satisfaction on professional identity and job burnout, and its relationship between job satisfaction and job burnout. During the peak period of the COVID-19 epidemic, we conducted an online survey-483 Chinese university teachers with online teaching experience completed the Teacher Professional Identity Scale, Job Satisfaction Scale, and Job Burnout Scale. The results of this study found professional identity and job satisfaction of university teachers to be significantly negative predictors of job burnout, with job satisfaction playing a moderating role between professional identity and job burnout. This study also confirmed that professional identity and job satisfaction are important factors affecting job burnout of university teachers. Therefore, this study proposed that schools should adopt more effective strategies to improve university teachers' professional identity and job satisfaction in order to reduce the practical problems of job burnout, ensure the effectiveness of online teaching, and maintain the sustainable development during the epidemic.","Chen, Huaruo; Liu, Fan; Pang, Liman; Liu, Fei; Fang, Tingting; Wen, Ya; Chen, Shi; Xie, Zhiyao; Zhang, Xuehui; Zhao, Yihong; Gu, Xueying",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,244
332073,How an endoscopy unit changed and was partially converted into an ICU during COVID-19 emergency in a tertiary referral hospital of Northern Italy,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Since the onset of the novel coronavirus pandemic, several neurological complications secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection have been reported, affecting central nervous system, peripheral nervous system and neuromuscular junction. CASE REPORT: We present the case of a 77-year-old man who developed bulbar myasthenia gravis (MG) eight weeks after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The search for serum antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor, the muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK), and the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 antibodies, performed by radioimmunoassay (RIA), resulted negative, while anti-MuSK antibodies were detected by cell-based assay (CBA). The patient was treated with pyridostigmine (60 mg four times a day) with unsatisfactory clinical response, followed by immunosuppressive therapy (azathioprine 1.5 mg/kg/day) with improvement of MG symptoms after two months of treatment. DISCUSSION: Several viral diseases have been described as associated with the onset of MG, although the underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood. Similarly, a growing number of scientific reports suggest a correlation between SARS-CoV-2 infection and autoimmune diseases. The interest of our case lies in the timing of the MG onset (after two months from infection), together with the unusual late onset of anti-MuSK MG. These elements suggest that coronavirus infection may act as a trigger of the disease. We confirm the importance of CBA in the serological diagnosis of RIA-negative MG.","Assini, Andrea; Gandoglia, Ilaria; Damato, Valentina; Rikani, Klaudio; Evoli, Amelia; Del Sette, Massimo",Eur. j. neurol,,244
332221,The transmission and diagnosis of 2019 novel coronavirus infection disease (COVID-19): A Chinese perspective,2020,"We describe the status of the COVID-19 epidemic in Vietnam, major response successes, factors that prompted implementation of certain public health actions, and the impact of these actions. In addition, information for three case studies is reported, with crucial learnings to inform future response. Findings from this study suggest that as early as 20 January 2020, Vietnam held a national risk assessment, established a national COVID-19 Response Plan and Technical Treatment and Care Guidelines, and prepared public health laboratories to accurately diagnose cases and hospitals to effectively treat patients. The first COVID-19 case was detected on 23 January. As of 30 September, there had been three waves of the COVID-19 epidemic totalling 1095 cases, and resulting in 35 deaths all among people with underlying health conditions. Evidence of potential transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from a commercial passenger flight inbound to Vietnam was reported. This study also highlights the importance of early technical preparedness, strong political commitment, multisectoral and multilevel efforts, increased resourcing and coordination towards an effective COVID-19 response. Controlling outbreaks in settings, such as crowded public places (bars and hospitals), within certain villages and over cities, required early detection, aggressive trace-test-quarantine efforts, a geographically extensive lockdown area and an adoption of several non-pharmaceutical interventions. Many low-income and middle-income countries have experienced their second or third wave of the COVID-19 epidemic, and they can learn from Vietnam's response across the three epidemic waves. Swift governmental action, strict border control measures, effective communication of health promotion measures, widespread community engagement, expanded testing capacity and effective social measures to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, are highly important in these locations.","Nguyen, Thuong Vu; Tran, Quang Dai; Phan, Lan Trong; Vu, Long Ngoc; Truong, Dung Thi Thuy; Truong, Hieu Cong; Le, Tu Ngoc; Vien, Linh Dang Khanh; Nguyen, Thinh Viet; Luong, Quang Chan; Pham, Quang Duy",,,244

As a result, COVID-19 has caused a major threat to global public health. In this paper, we use mathematical modeling to analyze the reported data of COVID-19 cases in Vietnam and study the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions. To achieve this, two models are used to describe the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. The first model belongs to the susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) type and is used to compute the basic reproduction number. The second model adopts a multi-scale approach which explicitly integrates the movement of each individual. Numerical simulations are conducted to quantify the effects of social distancing measures on the spread of COVID-19 in urban areas of Vietnam. Both models show that the adoption of relaxed social distancing measures reduces the number of infected cases but does not shorten the duration of the epidemic waves.

Although much has been discovered about COVID-19 and its pathogenesis, the WHO has identified an immediate need to increase the levels of testing for COVID-19 and identify the stages of the disease accurately for appropriate action to be taken by clinicians and emergency care units. Harnessing technology for accurate diagnosis and staging will improve patient outcomes and minimize serious consequences of false-positive test results. Point-of-care technologies aim to intervene at every stage of the disease to quickly identify infected patients and asymptomatic carriers and stratify them for timely treatment. This requires the tests to be rapid, accurate, sensitive, simple to use and compatible with many body fluids. Mobile platforms are optimal for remote, small-scale deployment, whereas facility-based platforms at hospital centers and laboratory settings offer higher throughput. Here we review evidence-based point-of-care technologies in the context of the entire continuum of COVID-19, from early screening to treatment, and discuss their impact on improving patient outcomes.","Parupudi, Tejasvi; Panchagnula, Neha; Muthukumar, Sriram; Prasad, Shalini",Biotechniques,,244

Inevitably, the pandemic impacted upon social work education and placement provision significantly. The ability to respond to the impact of the pandemic crisis within social work placements will be presented as an unprecedented wicked problem. The ability to respond to this crisis can be argued to have demonstrated the worth of teaching partnerships, as the developed relationships and understanding of partner’s differing priorities enabled this to be undertaken effectively, efficiently, and expediently. This article will reflect on how the Leeds and Wakefield Social Work Teaching Partnership (LWSWTP) undertook responsive partnership decision-making to develop and implement new placement protocols. The article will also explore if partnership working with the stakeholders has been sufficiently robust, using the Arnstein’s 1969 Ladder of Participation. The article will conclude by reflecting on the key learning points from partnership working in the Covid-19 crisis situation as we move forward post crisis.","Beesley, Paula; Devonald, Julie",Soc.

To elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms of COVID-19-associated cardiac injury, we conducted a single-center prospective cohort study of 69 COVID-19 decedents. Of six cardiac histopathologic features, microthrombi was the most commonly detected (n=48, 70%). We tested associations of cardiac microthrombi with biomarkers of inflammation, cardiac injury, and fibrinolysis and with in-hospital antiplatelet therapy, therapeutic anticoagulation, and corticosteroid treatment, while adjusting for multiple clinical factors, including COVID-19 therapies. Higher peak ESR and CRP during hospitalization were independently associated with higher odds of microthrombi. Using single nuclei RNA-sequence analysis, we discovered an enrichment of pro-thrombotic/anti-fibrinolytic, extracellular matrix remodeling, and immune-potentiating signaling amongst cardiac fibroblasts in microthrombi-positive COVID-19 hearts relative to microthrombi-negative COVID-19. Non-COVID-19 non-failing hearts were used as reference controls. Our cumulative findings identify the specific transcriptomic changes in cardiac fibroblasts as salient features of COVID-19-associated cardiac microthrombi.","Fukuma, Nobuaki; Hulke, Michelle L; Brener, Michael I; Golob, Stephanie; Zilinyi, Robert; Zhou, Zhipeng; Tzimas, Christos; Russo, Ilaria; McGroder, Claire; Pfeiffer, Ryan; Chong, Alexander; Zhang, Geping; Burkhoff, Daniel; Leon, Martin B; Maurer, Mathew; Moses, Jeffrey W; Uhlemann, Anne-Catrin; Hibshoosh, Hanina; Uriel, Nil; Szabolcs, Matthias J; Redfors, Björn; Marboe, Charles C; Baldwin, Matthew R; Tucker, Nathan R; Tsai, Emily J",,,244

The extent to which schools contribute to the overall propagation of SARS-CoV-2 was continuing to evolve internationally. AIMS: To examine regional data on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in primary, post-primary and special schools in Cork and Kerry, two counties in southwest Ireland, during the first 6 weeks of the 2020-2021 academic year and determine the rate of in-school transmission. METHODS: Data were obtained from the Computerised Infectious Disease Reporting (CIDR) system and supplemented with digital records from the regional Department of Public Health (Dept PH) and from the Health Service Executive (HSE) Covid Care Tracker application. The positivity rate among school close contacts was calculated to determine the rate of in-school SARS-CoV-2 transmission. RESULTS: The overall rate of in-school transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was low at 4.1%. Positivity rates among students and staff who were close contacts were similarly low (3.1% vs. 6.9%, p = 0.07). One secondary case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged, on average, for every 7.6 infectious days spent by an index case in school. Schools accounted for 2.2% of all notified cases of COVID-19 in the region during the observation period. CONCLUSIONS: During the first 6 weeks of the academic year, the rate of in-school SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the region was low, and schools did not contribute substantially to the overall burden of COVID-19.","White, Philippa; O039,; Sullivan, Margaret Bernadette; Murphy, Nicola; Stapleton, Jane; Dillon, Annette; Brennan, Aline; Deasy, Benvon; Carlton, Louise; Bermingham, Áine; Mahony, Mary Teresa; Murray, Deirdre; Nolan, Cliodhna Foley; Sheahan, Anne",Ir. j. med. sci,,244

Implementation of prevention measures is the best solution for protection of workers' health. OBJECTIVE: The present study investigated prevention measures and risk factors for the COVID-19 infection in Iranian small, medium, and large industries. METHODS: This study was conducted on 349 occupational health, safety, and environment professionals working in different industries. Data was collected using a checklist of prevention measures for COVID-19 and a questionnaire of risk factors for the infection. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that 32.60%of industries reported positive cases of COVID-19. The mean of prevention measures in all the dimensions, except use of personal protective equipment (PPE), was in favorable status. Among prevention measures against COVID-19, the dimensions of education, engineering controls, use of PPE, use of hand washing soap and disinfectant, and physical distance were not significantly different among small, medium, and large industries. However, administrative controls were statistically lower in small and medium industries compared to the large industries. Moreover, screening was statistically lower in small industries than in large industries. The mean risk factors of ventilation, use of common tools and equipment, and physical distance as well as total risk factors were not statistically different among different industries. CONCLUSION: Workers are at risk of COVID-19 infection. The risk factors of ventilation, sharing tools and equipment, and physical distance are critical in classification of risk of infection with COVID-19 in industrial settings.","Malekpour, F.; Ebrahimi, H.; Yarahmadi, R.; Mohammadin, Y.; Kharghani Moghadam, S.

346544,"Sosialisasi Waspada Infeksi Corona Virus Pada Lansia Di Panti Jompo Rumoh Seujahtra Geunaseh Sayang, Dinas Sosial Aceh",2020,"CONTEXT: Carceral institutions are among the largest clusters of COVID-19 in the United States. As outbreaks have spread throughout prisons and detention centers, detainees have organized collectively to demand life-saving measures. Chief among these demands has been the call for decarceration: the release of detainees and inmates to prevent exposure to COVID-19. This paper theorizes the compounding racial vulnerability that has led to such a marked spread behind bars, mainly among race-class subjugated communities. METHODS: We use journalistic sources and administrative data to provide an in-depth account of the spread of COVID-19 in American correctional facilities and of the mobilization to reduce contagions. We also use two survey experiments to describe public support for harm reduction and decarceration demands and measure the effects of information about (a) racial inequalities in prison, and (b) poor conditions inside migrant detention centers. FINDINGS: We find that only one-third to one-half of respondents believe that response to COVID-19 in prisons and immigrant detention centers should be a high priority. We also find that Americans are much more supportive of harm reduction measures like improved sanitation than of releasing people from prisons and detention centers. Information about racial disparities increases support for releasing more people from prison. We do not find any significant effect of information about poor conditions in migrant detention centers. CONCLUSIONS: The conditions in prisons and migrant detention centers during the pandemic-and public opinion about them-highlight the realities of compounding racialized vulnerability in the United States.","Denney, Matthew G T; Garibaldo Valdez, Ramon",J. health polit. policy law,,244

In the absence of vaccination or specific treatment, it became essential to comply with these measures to reduce infection transmission. Health literacy is the basis for changing behaviors. AIM: To characterize the impact of literacy on knowledge and attitudes towards preventive strategies against COVID-19. METHODS: This cross-sectional study involved an online questionnaire applied to students of the University of Porto, Portugal, containing questions about knowledge and attitudes towards COVID-19 based on European guidelines. Health literacy was assessed through the Newest Vital Sign questionnaire. Logistic regression estimated the relationship between health literacy and both knowledge and attitudes. RESULTS: We included 871 participants (76.3% female), with a median age of 22 years old. We found adequate literacy in 92% of our sample, irrespective of gender and age. In the global analysis, 78.6% of the participants had adequate knowledge, and 90.4% had adequate attitudes. We found that better literacy was significantly associated with attitudes towards COVID-19, but not with better knowledge. In a model adjusted for gender, age, and previous education in the health field, female gender and previous education in the health field were associated with better knowledge and attitudes. CONCLUSION: Better health literacy is associated with better attitudes towards preventive strategies against COVID-19.

The restrictions imposed have undoubtedly led to impairment of the psychological well-being of both teachers and students, and of the way they experience interpersonal relationships. As reported previously in the literature, adverse effects such as loneliness, anxiety, and stress have resulted in a decrease in the cognitive performance of school and higher education students. Therefore, the objective of this work is to present a general overview of the reported adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic which may potentially influence the learning performance of students. Some neuroscientific findings related to memory and cognition, such as neuroplasticity and long-term potentiation, are also shown. We also discuss the positive effects of the practice of mindfulness, as well as other simple recommendations based on neuroscientific findings such as restful sleep, physical activity, and nutrition, which can act on memory and cognition. Finally, we propose some practical recommendations on how to achieve more effective student learning in the context of the pandemic. The aim of this review is to provide some assistance in this changing and uncertain situation in which we all find ourselves, and we hope that some of the information could serve as a starting point for hypotheses to be tested in educational research and their association with neuroscience.","Tortella, G.

STUDY DESIGN/METHODS: During March-August 2020, approximately &#8805;1,000 serum specimens were collected monthly from each region and tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using a well-validated algorithm. Regional seroprevalence estimates were weighted based on demographic differences with the general population. Seroprevalence was compared with reported COVID-19 case rates over time. RESULTS/FINDINGS: For all regions, seroprevalence was <1.0% in March 2020. New York experienced the biggest increase (peak seroprevalence, 15.8 % in May). All other regions experienced modest increases in seroprevalence(1-2% in May-June to 2-4% in July-August). Seroprevalence was higher in younger, non-Hispanic Black, and Hispanic donors. Temporal increases in donor seroprevalence correlated with reported case rates in each region. In August, 1.3-5.6 estimated cumulative infections (based on seroprevalence data) per COVID-19 case reported to CDC. CONCLUSION: Increases in seroprevalence were found in all regions, with the largest increase in New York. Seroprevalence was higher in non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic blood donors than in non-Hispanic White blood donors.

354283,"Neutralizing Autoantibodies to Type I IFNs in >10% of Patients with Severe COVID-19 Pneumonia Hospitalized in Madrid, Spain",2021,"PURPOSE: To assess the reliability and construct validity of a self-paced, submaximal run test (SRTRPE) for monitoring aerobic fitness. The SRTRPE monitors running velocity (v), heart rate (HRex), and blood lactate concentration (B[La]), during three 3-minute stages prescribed by ratings of perceived exertion (RPEs) of 10, 13, and 17. METHODS: Forty (14 female) trained endurance runners completed a treadmill graded exercise test for the determination of maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max), v at VO2max (vVO2max), and v at 2 mmol·L-1 (vLT1) and 4 mmol·L-1 (vLT2) B[La]. Within 7 days, participants completed the SRTRPE. Convergent validity between the SRTRPE and graded exercise test parameters was assessed through linear regression. Eleven participants completed a further 2 trials of the SRTRPE within a 72-hour period to quantify test-retest reliability. RESULTS: There were large correlations between v at all stages of the SRTRPE and VO2max (r range = .57-.63), vVO2max (.50-.66), and vLT2 (.51-.62), with vRPE 17 displaying the strongest associations (r > .60). Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC3,1) were moderate to high for parameters v (range = .76-.84), HRex (.72-.92), and %HRmax (.64-.89) at all stages of the SRTRPE. The corresponding coefficients of variation were 2.5% to 5.6%. All parameters monitored at intensity RPE 17 displayed the greatest reliability. CONCLUSIONS: The SRTRPE was shown to be a valid and reliable test for monitoring parameters associated with aerobic fitness, displaying the potential of this submaximal, time-efficient test to monitor responses to endurance training.","Sangan, Hannah F; Hopker, James G; Davison, Glen; McLaren, Shaun J",Int J Sports Physiol Perform,,244
354897,Improved clinical symptoms and mortality among patients with severe or critical COVID-19 after convalescent plasma transfusion,2020,"BACKGROUND: The safety of methods of labor induction in women with previous cesarean deliveries is still debated. We investigated perinatal outcomes associated with labor induction among women with a trial of labor after one cesarean delivery. METHODS: This retrospective study included 339 women with a trial of labor after one prior cesarean and a singleton term fetus in cephalic presentation in 2013-2016 in a French maternity unit. Labor induction was performed with oxytocin, artificial rupture of membranes and/or prostaglandin E2, according to the Bishop score. The primary outcome was a composite of uterine rupture, low Apgar score, neonatal resuscitation or admission to a neonatal unit. The secondary outcomes included cesarean delivery after onset of labor, postpartum hemorrhage and maternal hospital stay after delivery. We used logistic regression to estimate odds ratios adjusted (aOR) for potential confounders. RESULTS: In our sample, 67.3% of women had spontaneous labor and 32.7% were induced. More than half of the women received oxytocin during labor regardless of the mode of labor. The proportions of the composite outcome and of cesarean after onset of labor were higher in the induced group compared to the spontaneous group (26.1% vs 15.8%, p = 0.02 and 45.0% vs 27.6%, p<0.01, respectively). There were 9 uterine ruptures (2.6%) and this proportion was higher in the induced group compared to the spontaneous group, although this difference was not statistically significant (3.6% vs 2.2%, p = 0.48). After adjustment, labor induction was associated with higher risks of the composite outcome (aOR = 2.45, 95% CI: 1.29-4.65), cesarean after onset of labor (aOR = 2.06, 95% CI: 1.15-3.68) and maternal hospital stay after delivery &#8805;6 days (aOR = 6.20, 95% CI: 3.25-11.81). No association was found with postpartum hemorrhage. CONCLUSION: Labor induction after one prior cesarean was associated with a higher risk of adverse perinatal outcome. Nevertheless, the higher proportion of uterine rupture did not differ significantly from that in the spontaneous labor group.","Vecchioli, Emma; Cordier, Anne-Gaël; Chantry, Anne; Benachi, Alexandra; Monier, Isabelle",PLoS One,,244

355697,Some thoughts on conducting and implementing clinical practice guidelines in a pandemic,2020,"RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: Outcomes of patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and acute kidney injury (AKI) are not well understood. The goal of this study was to investigate the survival and kidney outcomes of these patients. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Patients (aged&#8805;18 years) hospitalized with COVID-19 at 13 hospitals in metropolitan New York between March 1, 2020, and April 27, 2020, followed up until hospital discharge. EXPOSURE: AKI. OUTCOMES: Primary outcome: in-hospital death. SECONDARY OUTCOMES: requiring dialysis at discharge, recovery of kidney function. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Univariable and multivariable time-to-event analysis and logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 9,657 patients admitted with COVID-19, the AKI incidence rate was 38.4/1,000 patient-days. Incidence rates of in-hospital death among patients without AKI, with AKI not requiring dialysis (AKI stages 1-3), and with AKI receiving dialysis (AKI 3D) were 10.8, 31.1, and 37.5/1,000 patient-days, respectively. Taking those without AKI as the reference group, we observed greater risks for in-hospital death for patients with AKI 1-3 and AKI 3D (HRs of 5.6 [95% CI, 5.0-6.3] and 11.3 [95% CI, 9.6-13.1], respectively). After adjusting for demographics, comorbid conditions, and illness severity, the risk for death remained higher among those with AKI 1-3 (adjusted HR, 3.4 [95% CI, 3.0-3.9]) and AKI 3D (adjusted HR, 6.4 [95% CI, 5.5-7.6]) compared with those without AKI. Among patients with AKI 1-3 who survived, 74.1% achieved kidney recovery by the time of discharge. Among those with AKI 3D who survived, 30.6% remained on dialysis at discharge, and prehospitalization chronic kidney disease was the only independent risk factor associated with needing dialysis at discharge (adjusted OR, 9.3 [95% CI, 2.3-37.8]). LIMITATIONS: Observational retrospective study, limited to the NY metropolitan area during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: AKI in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 was associated with significant risk for death.","Ng, Jia H; Hirsch, Jamie S; Hazzan, Azzour; Wanchoo, Rimda; Shah, Hitesh H; Malieckal, Deepa A; Ross, Daniel W; Sharma, Purva; Sakhiya, Vipulbhai; Fishbane, Steven; Jhaveri, Kenar D",Am. j. kidney dis,,244

358548,Integrated Optofluidic Sensor for Coagulation Risk Monitoring in COVID-19 Patients at Point-of-Care,2020-08-27,"Risk-based monitoring (RBM) is a powerful tool for efficiently ensuring patient safety and data integrity in a clinical trial, enhancing overall trial quality. To better understand the state of RBM implementation across the clinical trial industry, the Association of Clinical Research Organizations (ACRO) conducted a landscape survey among its member companies across 6,513 clinical trials ongoing at the end of 2019. Of these trials, 22% included at least 1 of the 5 RBM components: key risk indicators (KRIs), centralized monitoring, off-site/remote-site monitoring, reduced source data verification (SDV), and reduced source document review (SDR). The implementation rates for the individual RBM components ranged 8%-19%, with the most frequently implemented component being centralized monitoring and the least frequently implemented being reduced SDR. When the COVID-19 pandemic emerged in early 2020, additional data were collected to assess its impact on trial monitoring, focusing specifically on trials switching from on-site monitoring to off-site/remote-site monitoring. These mid-pandemic data show that the vast majority of monitoring visits were on-site in February 2020, but an even higher percentage were off-site in April, corresponding with the first peak of the pandemic. Despite this shift, similar numbers of non-COVID-related protocol deviations were detected from February through June, suggesting little or no reduction in monitoring effectiveness. The pre- and mid-pandemic data provide two very different snapshots of RBM implementation, but both support the need to promote adoption of this approach while also highlighting an opportunity to capitalize on the recent shift toward greater RBM uptake in a post-pandemic environment.","Barnes, Brian; Stansbury, Nicole; Brown, Debby; Garson, Lauren; Gerard, Geoff; Piccoli, Nickolas; Jendrasek, Debra; May, Nick; Castillo, Vanesa; Adelfio, Anina; Ramirez, Nycole; McSweeney, Andrea; Berlien, Ruth; Butler, Paula Jo",Ther. innov. regul. sci.

358944,Management of a Complex Case during COVID-19 Time Using One-day Digital Dentistry: A Case Report,2020,"A novel thin-walled direct-to-bone fixation ceramic cup was tested under critical impact loads simulating lateral fall and car crash scenarios. Three sizes of BIOLOX delta ceramic cups (total hip replacement cup with bearing diameter of 32 mm and two hip resurfacing cups with bearing diameters of 40 and 64mm) were implanted into reamed Sawbones blocks representing acetabulae. Three cups of each size were fully supported by the block and three were implanted with 15° of the cup's outer diameter unsupported by the block. All testing was conducted with the corresponding bearing diameter heads lateralised by approximately 1 mm to represent worst case subluxed hips and all then subjected to test, replicating a lateral fall impact followed by a car crash impact. All cups passed lateral fall conditions without visible damage, although some movement of the cups was measured and damage to the blocks was observed. Five out of six of each cup size survived the car crash impacts with one fracture per size. In all cases, this was in the fully supported condition representing the highest cup inclination angle. The car crash impact force was equivalent to that reported to fracture the acetabulum and in all simulated cases, the Sawbones block showed signs of damage. Survival of five cups per size suggests the pelvis is much more likely to fracture before the cup. The ability of the cups to withstand these critical impact forces indicates they are unlikely to fracture in normal clinical use and should meet the more challenging demands of active patients likely to receive this device.","de Villiers, Danielle; Collins, Simon",Proc Inst Mech Eng H,,244

362451,Cardiovascular disease due to novel coronavirus and the search for investigational therapies,2020,"BACKGROUND: Bacillus thuringiensis bacteria share similar genetic, physiological, and biochemical characteristics with other members of the Bacillus cereus group. Their diversity and entomopathogenic origin are related to their mobile genetic elements. However, the effects of wide-spread application of B. thuringiensis-based pesticides on genetically related B. cereus group populations present in the environment remain poorly understood. RESULTS: We first identified pBMB76 from B. thuringiensis tenebrionis as a new conjugative plasmid. Mixed mating experiments suggested that pBMB76 may compete with pHT73, another known conjugative plasmid. Applications of single (tenebrionis 4AA1 and kurstaki HD73 carrying pBMB76 and pHT73, respectively) and mixed (4AA1 + HD73) B. thuringiensis strains were performed in confined plot habitats (soil and leaf) over two planting seasons. In total, 684 B. cereus group isolates were randomly selected from different treatment sets, and the transmissibility and occurrence rate of potential conjugative plasmids were surveyed. Results showed that the percentage of isolates with plasmid mobility was markedly enhanced in the B. thuringiensis-sprayed groups. Furthermore, we performed multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) for a subset of 291 isolates, which indicated that the dominant sequence types in the treated habitats were identical or related to the corresponding sprayed formulations. CONCLUSIONS: The application of B. thuringiensis strains with conjugal and mobilizing capability drove gene transmissibility within the B. cereus group populations in confined habitats and potentially modified the population structure.","Hu, Xiaomin; Huang, Doudou; Ogalo, Joseph; Geng, Peiling; Yuan, Zhiming; Xiong, Hairong; Wan, Xiaofu; Sun, Jiahui",BMC Microbiol,,244

Comment on ""Early treatment of COVID-19 patients with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin: A retrospective analysis of 1061 cases in Marseille, France""",2020,"Antiviral drugs have been used to treat the ever-growing number of coronavirus disease, 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Consequently, unprecedented amounts of such drug residues discharging into ambient waters raise concerns on the potential ecotoxicological effects to aquatic lives, as well as development of antiviral drug-resistance in wildlife. Here, we estimated the occurrence, fate and ecotoxicological risk of 11 therapeutic agents suggested as drugs for COVID-19 treatment and their 13 metabolites in wastewater and environmental waters, based on drug consumption, physical-chemical property, and ecotoxicological and pharmacological data for the drugs, with the aid of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modelling. Our results suggest that the removal efficiencies at conventional wastewater treatment plants will remain low (<20%) for half of the substances, and consequently, high drug residues (e.g. 7402 ng/L ribavirin, 4231 ng/L favipiravir, 730 ng/L lopinavir, 319 ng/L remdesivir; each combined for both unchanged forms and metabolites; and when each drug is administered to 100 patients out of 100,000 populations on a day) can be present in secondary effluents and persist in the environmental waters. Ecotoxicological risk in receiving river waters can be high (risk quotient >1) by a use of favipiravir, lopinavir, umifenovir and ritonavir, and medium (risk quotient >0.1) by a use of chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, and ribavirin, while the risk will remain low (risk quotient <0.1) for dexamethasone and oseltamivir. The potential of wild animals acquiring antiviral drug resistance was estimated to be low. Our prediction suggests a pressing need for proper usage and waste management of antiviral drugs as well as for improving removal efficiencies of drug residues in wastewater.","Kuroda, Keisuke; Li, Cong; Dhangar, Kiran; Kumar, Manish",Sci Total Environ,,244
362511,Previous and active tuberculosis increases risk of death and prolongs recovery in patients with COVID-19,2020,"PURPOSE: To date, the majority of chest imaging studies in COVID-19 pneumonia have focused on CT. Evidence for the utility of chest radiographs (CXRs) in this population is less robust. Our objectives were to develop a systematic approach for reporting likelihood of COVID-19 pneumonia on CXRs, to measure the interobserver variability of this approach and to evaluate the diagnostic performance of CXRs compared to real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). METHOD: Retrospective review of patients suspected of having COVID-19 pneumonia who attended our emergency department and underwent both CXR and a RT-PCR were included. Two radiologists reviewed the CXRs, blind to the RT-PCR, and classified them according to a structured reporting template with five categories (Characteristic, High Suspicion, Indeterminate, Unlikely and Normal) which we devised. For analysis of diagnostic accuracy, Characteristic and High Suspicion CXRs were considered positive and the remaining categories negative. Concordance between the two assessors was also measured. RESULTS: Of 582 patients (51 +/- 20 years), 143/582 (24.6 %) had a positive RT-PCR. The absolute concordance between the two assessors was 71.1 % (414/582) with a Fleiss-Cohen-weighted Cohen's &#954; of 0.81 (95 % confidence interval, 0.78-0.85). A patient with a positive CXR had an 88 % (95 % CI 80-96 %) probability of having a positive RT-PCR during a period of high incidence, early in the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: Using a structured approach, a positive CXR had a high likelihood of predicting a positive RT-PCR, with good interrater reliability. CXRs can be useful in identifying new cases of COVID-19.","Yates, Andrew; Dempsey, Philip J; Vencken, Sebastian; MacMahon, Peter J; Hutchinson, Barry D",Eur J Radiol,,244
363014,Research updates of diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19/ 新型冠状病毒肺炎诊治研究进展,2020,"BACKGROUND: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease with various clinical manifestations involving multiple organ systems. Neuropsychiatric manifestations of SLE have been associated with increased morbidity and mortality, thus it is important to recognize and diagnose the disease entity and treat early. When neuropsychiatric symptoms are involved, typically there are many other systemic features to aid in the diagnosis of SLE. Many autoantibodies have been discovered and are used to help diagnose SLE. The antibody present in most cases of pediatric SLE, as well as in many other rheumatic diseases, is the nonspecific antinuclear antibody (ANA). The ANA is a commonly used screening tool by primary care physicians when evaluating a patient with a possible rheumatic disorder. However, a small subset of SLE patients, 1-5%, present with a negative ANA, and it is important to keep SLE on the differential diagnosis in specific instances when a thorough infectious, metabolic and neurological workup has been completed and proven to be inconclusive. CASE PRESENTATION: This case involves a Hispanic adolescent female with a negative ANA who presented with diffuse cerebral edema secondary to leukoencephalopathy due to SLE with central nervous system involvement. She was normotensive on presentation and relatively symptom free aside from headache. She had an extensive workup while inpatient involving metabolic, infectious disease, rheumatology, and neurology prior to obtaining the diagnosis of SLE. She was treated with cyclophosphamide and rituximab with appropriate disease response. CONCLUSIONS: A review of the literature revealed 12 cases with SLE presenting with or developing diffuse cerebral edema and/or leukoencephalopathy. Our patient's case differs in that she was also ANA negative despite other autoantibody positivity.

363770,COVID-19 in Liver Transplant Patients: Report of 2 Cases and Review of the Literature,2020,"With the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, resources have been reallocated and elective cases have been deferred to minimize the spread of the disease, altering the workflow of cardiac catheterization laboratories across the country. This has in turn affected the training experience of cardiology fellows, including diminished procedure numbers and a narrow breadth of cases as they approach the end of their training before joining independent practice. It has also taken a toll on the emotional well-being of fellows as they see their colleagues, loved ones, patients or even themselves struggling with COVID-19, with some succumbing to it. The aim of this opinion piece is to focus attention on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on fellows and their training, challenges faced as they transition to practicing in the real world in the near future and share the lessons learned thus far. We believe that this is an important contribution and would be of interest not only to cardiology fellows-in-training and cardiologists but also trainees in other procedural specialties.","Kadavath, Sabeeda; Hawwas, Dalia; Strobel, Aaron; Mohan, Jay; Bernardo, Marie; Kassier, Adnan; Ya039,; qoub, Lina; Madan, Nidhi; Ashraf, Said; Salehi, Negar; Mawri, Sagger; Rehman, Karim Abdur; Siraj, Aisha; Alraies, Chadi; Saad, Marwan; Aronow, Herbert",Am. j. cardiol,,244

To learn more about future healthcare professionals' volunteering during such an outbreak, we conducted a survey among 417 students of Poznan University of Medical Sciences. Our findings suggest that although numerous studies demonstrate that traditional, value-based volunteering is decreasing, and especially higher education students are more oriented toward their own career, in the times of the current health crisis, young peoples' involvement in volunteering has been mainly driven by altruism and the ethical imperative to serve their community, their fellow healthcare professionals and their patients. Thus, while the prime role of the volunteering was to relieve the healthcare system, it also reinforced such important medical values as altruism, public service and professional solidarity. Moreover, it proved that whilst risk is inherent to medicine, the students' volunteering is truly a moral enterprise.","Domaradzki, J.; Walkowiak, D.",Frontiers in Public Health,,244
367438,COVID-19 and the Kidney Community: Coalescing in Crisis,2020,"Geographical variation in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS--CoV--2) spread requires seroprevalence studies based on local tests, but robust validation is needed. We summarize an evaluation of antibody tests used in a serological study of SARS--CoV--2 in Saint Petersburg, Russia. We validated three different antibody assays: chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) Abbott Architect SARS--CoV--2 immunoglobulin G (IgG), enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) CoronaPass total antibodies test, and ELISA SARS--CoV--2--IgG--EIA--BEST. Clinical sensitivity was estimated with the SARS--CoV--2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test as the gold standard using manufacturer recommended cutoff. Specificity was estimated using pre-pandemic sera samples. The median time between positive PCR test results and antibody tests was 21 weeks. Measures of concordance were calculated against the microneutralization test (MNA).Sensitivity was equal to 91.1% (95% confidence intervbal [CI]: 78.8-97.5), 90% (95% CI: 76.4-96.4), and 63.1% (95% CI [50.2-74.7]) for ELISA Coronapass, ELISA Vector-Best, and CMIA Abbott, respectively. Specificity was equal to 100% for all the tests. Comparison of receiver operating characteristics has shown lower AUC for CMIA Abbott. The cut-off SC/O ratio of 0.28 for CMIA Abbott resulted in a sensitivity of 80% at the same level of specificity. Less than 33% of the participants with positive antibody test results had neutralizing antibodies in titers 1:80 and above. Antibody assays results and MNA correlated moderately. This study encourages the use of local antibody tests and sets the reference for seroprevalence correction. Available tests' sensitivity allows detecting antibodies within the majority of PCR- positive individuals. The Abbott assay sensitivity can be improved by incorporating a new cut-off. Manufacturers' test characteristics may introduce bias into the study results.","Barchuk, Anton; Shirokov, Daniil; Sergeeva, Mariia; Tursun Zade, Rustam; Dudkina, Olga; Tychkova, Varvara; Barabanova, Lubov; Skougarevskiy, Dmitriy; Danilenko, Daria",J. med. virol,,244

As most diseases emerge out of the human-animal interface, a better understanding of the specific drivers and mechanisms involved is crucial to prepare for future disease outbreaks. Interactions between wildlife and livestock systems contribute to the emergence of zoonotic diseases, especially in the face of globalization, habitat fragmentation and destruction and climate change. As several groups of viruses and bacteria are more likely to emerge, we focus on pathogenic viruses of the Bunyavirales, Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, and Paramyxoviridae, as well as bacterial species including Mycobacterium sp., Brucella sp., Bacillus anthracis and Coxiella burnetii. Noteworthy, it was difficult to predict the drivers of disease emergence in the past, even for well-known pathogens. Thus, an improved surveillance in hotspot areas and the availability of fast, effective, and adaptable control measures would definitely contribute to preparedness.

Design: Experimental study to test the effectiveness of personal protective equipment. Methods: The nozzle of a spray gun was adjusted to angularly disperse a mist of colored dye that approximated a patient sneezing on a dimensionally accurate cardboard slit lamp model. The designs of 6 commercially available breath shields and 1 breath shield repurposed from a plastic container lid were tested. Each breath shield was sprayed in a standardized fashion 3 times, and the amount of overspray was compared to spray with no shield and quantified. The surface area that was sprayed was calculated using a commercially available software with color range function. The average percentage of overspray of each breath shield was computed in comparison to the control. Results: The breath shields ranged in surface area from 116 to 924 cm2, and the amount of overspray varied from 54% to virtually none. Larger breath shields offered better protection than smaller ones. Breath shields attached to the objective lens arm were better barriers than those of comparable size hung by the oculars. A repurposed plastic lid breath shield, 513 cm2, was slightly curved toward the examiner's face and allowed only 2% overspray. The largest breath shield (924 cm2) hung near the oculars and prevented essentially all overspray. Conclusions: The performance of different designs of breath shields was variable. Even high-functioning shields should be used in conjunction with personal protective equipment including masks, goggles, and gloves and handwashing. Ideally patients should also wear a face mask during all slit lamp examinations.","Liu, John; Wang, Annie Y; Ing, Edsel B",Am J Ophthalmol,,244

It was named COVID-19, and to date, thousands of cases of infection and death are reported worldwide. This disease is associated with a wide range of symptoms, which makes accurate diagnosis of it difficult. During previous severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic in 2003, researchers found that the patients with fever, cough, or sore throat had a 5% influenza virus-positive rate. This finding made us think that the wide range of symptoms and also relatively high prevalence of death in our patients may be due to the coinfection with other viruses. Thus, we evaluated the coinfection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with other respiratory viruses in dead patients in North Khorasan. We evaluated the presence of influenza A/B virus, human metapneumovirus, bocavirus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and parainfluenza viruses in 105 SARS-CoV-2 positive dead patients, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcription PCR tests. We found coinfection with influenza virus in 22.3%, RSV, and bocavirus in 9.7%, parainfluenza viruses in 3.9%, human metapneumovirus in 2.9%, and finally adenovirus in 1.9% of SARS-CoV-2 positive dead cases. Our findings highlight a high prevalence of coinfection with influenza A virus and the monopoly of coinfection with Human metapneumovirus in children.","Hashemi, Seyed A; Safamanesh, Saghar; Ghasemzadeh-Moghaddam, Hamed; Ghafouri, Majid; Azimian, Amir",J. med. virol,,244

The extent of emergency activation needed to adequately respond to this global pandemic was not immediately known, as the evolving situation differed significantly from any past disaster response preparations in that there was potential for exponential growth of infection, unproven mitigation strategies, serious risk to health care workers, and inadequate supply chains for critical equipment. APPROACH: The rapid transition of the UW Medicine system to account for projected COVID-19 and usual patient care, while balancing patient and staff safety and conservation of resources, represents an example of an adaptive disaster response. KEY INSIGHTS: Although our organization's ability to meet the needs of the public was uncertain, we planned and implemented changes to space, supply management, and staffing plans to meet the influx of patients across our clinical entities. The surge management plan called for specific actions to be implemented based on the level of activity.

The goal of this study was to investigate individual-level relationship satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic in a sample of 209 coupled GBMSM in the United States. We analyzed reported happiness and feelings about a relationship's future and assessed the odds of changing relationship happiness and investment associated with pandemic-related life changes (pandemic-related employment change; COVID-19 illness; high-risk of severe illness), using logistic and multinomial logit models. Fifty-five percent of participants (N = 114) reported that their relationship happiness had not changed during the pandemic, but 30% (N = 62) reported increased relationship happiness. 25% (N = 53) reported they had become more invested in their relationship's future during the pandemic, and only one participant reported decreased investment. The odds of increased relationship investment was significantly associated with pandemic-related employment change (adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.19 [1.04, 4.61]) and increased sex during the pandemic (aOR: 4.38 [1.55, 12.41]). Those with a pandemic-related employment change also had significantly higher odds of increased relationship happiness than those without a change (aOR: 2.10 [1.01, 4.35]). COVID-19 cases that reported being at higher risk of serious COVID-19 disease had higher odds of decreased relationship happiness than high-risk non-cases (aOR: 6.58 [1.10, 39.39]).

372006,Low-dose hydroxychloroquine therapy and mortality in hospitalised patients with COVID-19: a nationwide observational study of 8075 participants,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Platelets, blood coagulation along with fibrinolysis are greatly involved in the pathophysiology of infectious diseases induced by bacteria, parasites and virus. This phenomenon is not surprising since both the innate immunity and the hemostatic systems are two ancestral mechanisms which closely cooperate favoring host's defense against foreign invaders. However, the excessive response of these systems may be dangerous for the host itself. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched and retrieved the articles, using the following electronic database: MedLine and Embase. We limited our search to articles published in English, but no restrictions in terms of article type, publication year, and geography were adopted. RESULTS: The hemostatic phenotype of the infectious diseases is variable depending on the points of attack of the different involved pathogens. Infectious diseases which show a prothrombotic phenotype are bacterial sepsis, SARS-CoV-2 and malaria. However, among the bacterial sepsis, Yersinia Pestis is characterized by a profibrinolytic behavior. On the contrary, the hemorrhagic fevers, due to Dengue and Ebola virus, mainly exploit the activation of fibrinolysis secondary to a huge endothelial damage which can release a large amount of t-PA in the early phase of the diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Blood coagulation and fibrinolysis are greatly activated based on the strategy of the different infectious agents which exploit the excess of response of both systems to achieve the greatest possible virulence.","Marongiu, F; Grandone, E; Scano, A; Orrù, G; Marongiu, S; Gerosa, C; Fanni, D; Faa, G; Barcellona, D",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,244

374226,Cerebrovascular Events in Children on Intracorporeal Continuous-Flow Left Ventricular Assist Devices,2020,"Monotone matrices play a key role in the convergence theory of regular splittings and different types of weak regular splittings. If monotonicity fails, then it is difficult to guarantee the convergence of the above-mentioned classes of matrices. In such a case, $K$-monotonicity is sufficient for the convergence of $K$-regular and $K$-weak regular splittings, where $K$ is a proper cone in $\mathbb{R}^n$. However, the convergence theory of a two-stage iteration scheme in general proper cone setting is a gap in the literature. Especially, the same study for weak regular splittings of type II (even if in standard proper cone setting, i.e., $K=\mathbb{R}^n_+$), is open. To this end, we propose convergence theory of two-stage iterative scheme for $K$-weak regular splittings of both types in the proper cone setting. We provide some sufficient conditions which guarantee that the induced splitting from a two-stage iterative scheme is a $K$-regular splitting and then establish some comparison theorems. We also study $K$-monotone convergence theory of the stationary two-stage iterative method in case of a $K$-weak regular splitting of type II. The most interesting and important part of this work is on $M$-matrices appearing in the Covid-19 pandemic model. Finally, numerical computations are performed using the proposed technique to compute the next generation matrix involved in the pandemic model.","Shekhar, Vaibhav; Mishra, Nachiketa; Mishra, Debasisha",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.06047v1.pdf,244

The WHA73 Resolutions concern specific conditions, as has been characteristic of global health practice, yet proper care for each highlighted disease is inextricably linked to surgical care. Global surgery advocates must recognize how surgical system strengthening aligns with these strategic priorities in order to ensure that surgical care continues to be integrated into efforts to decrease global health disparities.","Cahill, Gabrielle L; Stankey, Makela C; McClain, Craig D; Park, Kee B",Ann Glob Health,,244

378731,Fulminant Myocarditis in Fontan Patient Treated with Mechanical Circulatory Support and Heartmate 3,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has limited the freedom of any citizen, further increased constraint for people in EHPAD - the most widespread type of French Residential care for senior citizens with a high level of dependency, often very aged, suffering multiple pathologies and sometimes psycho-behavioral disorders. ""Golden"" containment rule was 24/7 confinement in their room, with the very restrictive framework - up to NO visiting by relatives - and very often with a total absence of consent as for screening sample decisions. We can then question the fundamentals of such restriction of freedom, which is a constitutional right for everybody, including for residents in EHPAD, especially non-compliance with self-determination and consent. The principal objective has been a collective interest, before the individual right and the benefit for the patient itself. Nothing would have been justifying to create a possible risk to other residents, generated by another resident's behavior or one of his relatives. But these safety measures were taken despite the underlying risk of deteriorating individual situations through social and emotional isolation, and thus to further reduce autonomy capacities. ""Luckily"" the know-how and creative spirit of EHPAD professionals limited the consequences of this restriction of freedom. Hard lessons should be learned from share experiences if such a context were to occur again. But above all arises the question of the place of these dependent people in our society. It is essential to think collectively about these living spaces including protocols that should reflect people's choice and on-location adapted to be more open to the outside/foreigners visits. Spaces shall be adapted to their vulnerability, designed to reduce isolation, to repeat such extreme restrictive measures in the event if it shall occur.

378822,Intravenous immunoglobulin treatment for patients with severe COVID-19: a retrospective multi-center study,2021,"Interleukin-21: A Potential Biomarker For Diagnosis and Predicting Prognosis in COVID-19 Patients Abstract Introduction COVID-19 patients have a wide spectrum of disease severity. Several biomarkers were evaluated as predictors for progression towards severe disease. IL-21 is a member of common ?-chain cytokine family and creates some specific effects during programming and maintenance of antiviral immunity. We aimed to assess IL-21 as a biomarker for diagnosis and outcome prediction in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Method Patients with a preliminary diagnosis of COVID-19 and pneumonia other than COVID-19 admitted to a tertiary care hospital were included consecutively in this comparative study. Results The study population consisted of 51 patients with COVID-19 and 11 patients with non-COVID-19 pneumonia. Serum IL-21 concentration was markedly higher and serum CRP concentration was significantly lower in COVID-19 patients compared to non-COVID-19 pneumonia patients. Within COVID-19 patients 10 patients showed radiological and clinical progression. Patients with clinical worsening had lower lymphocyte count and haemoglobin. In addition to that deteriorating patients had higher urea, LDH levels and elevated concentration of both IL-6 and IL-21. The cut-off value of 106 ng/L for IL-21 has 80.0% sensitivity, %60.9 specificity for discriminating patients with clinical worsening. Multivariable analysis performed to define risk factors for disease progression identified IL-6 and IL-21 as independent predictors. Odds ratio for serum IL-6 concentrations ? 3.2 pg/mL was 8.07 (95% CI: 1.37-47.50, p=0.04) and odds ratio for serum IL-21 concentrations ? 106 ng/L was 6.24 (95% CI: 1.04 ? 37.3, p=0.02). Conclusion We identified specific differences in serum IL-21 between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 pneumonia patients. Serum IL-21 measurement has promising predictive value for disease progression in COVID-19 patients. High serum IL-6 and IL-21 levels obtained upon admission are independent risk factors for clinical worsening.","Acet Öztürk, Nilüfer Aylin; Ursavas, Ahmet; Görek Dilektasli, Asli; Demirdögen, Ezgi; Coskun, Necmiye Funda; Ediger, Dane; Uzaslan, Ayse Esra; Yöyen Ermis, Digdem; Karaca, Mert; Terzi, Orkun Eray; Bayram, Merve; Ömer Topçu, Dilara; Yigitliler, Büsra; Yurttas, Ahmet; Maharramov, Shahriyar; Yazici, Gamze; Oral, Haluk Barbaros; Karadag, Mehmet",Turkish journal of medical sciences,,244

METHOD: Researchers used the Facebook search engine to select local Facebook groups. RESULTS: Nurses were perceived to perform a constructive role when acting as the first-line health provider , having a public awareness role, and providing care for patients. Advocating and supporting the sick and their families, ignoring and underestimating their role,nurses have a positive perception of their roles during the coronavirus pandemic. Besides being responsible for their daily activities during the epidemic, they had additional roles of ensuring the safety and contentment of their patients. CONCLUSION: In general, nurses in Jordan perceived their roles during the COVID-19 outbreak to be constructive. They performed the task of supporting and advocating for the sick and their families. Despite these efforts during the outbreak. IMPLICATION FOR NURSING: Nurses in general, nursing leaders and managers are in the forefront of responding to the unique needs of their workforces during the COVID-19 crisis.

383379,COVID-19 and stroke: A case report,2020,"Event-based surveillance (EBS) systems monitor a broad range of information sources to detect early signals of disease emergence, including new and unknown diseases. In December 2019, a newly identified coronavirus emerged in Wuhan (China), causing a global coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. A retrospective study was conducted to evaluate the capacity of three event-based surveillance (EBS) systems (ProMED, HealthMap and PADI-web) to detect early COVID-19 emergence signals. We focused on changes in online news vocabulary over the period before/after the identification of COVID-19, while also assessing its contagiousness and pandemic potential. ProMED was the timeliest EBS, detecting signals one day before the official notification. At this early stage, the specific vocabulary used was related to 'pneumonia symptoms' and 'mystery illness'. Once COVID-19 was identified, the vocabulary changed to virus family and specific COVID-19 acronyms. Our results suggest that the three EBS systems are complementary regarding data sources, and all require timeliness improvements. EBS methods should be adapted to the different stages of disease emergence to enhance early detection of future unknown disease outbreaks.","Valentin, Sarah; Mercier, Alizé; Lancelot, Renaud; Roche, Mathieu; Arsevska, Elena",Transbound. emerg. dis.

388144,Guillain Barré Syndrome and its variants as a manifestation of COVID-19: A systematic review of case reports and case series,2021,"BACKGROUND: Improving children and young people's (CYP) health and addressing health inequalities are international priorities. Reducing inequalities is particularly pertinent in light of the Covid-19 outbreak which has exacerbated already widening inequalities in health. This study aimed to explore understandings of inequality, the anticipated pathways for reducing inequalities among CYP and key factors affecting the development and implementation of policy to reduce inequalities among CYP at a local level. METHODS: We carried out a qualitative case study of one local government region in the North of England (UK), comprising semi structured interviews (n = 16) with service providers with a responsibility for child health, non-participant observations of key meetings (n = 6 with 43 participants) where decisions around child health are made, and a local policy documentation review (n = 11). We employed a novel theoretical framework, drawing together different approaches to understanding policy, to guide our design and analysis. RESULTS: Participants in our study understood inequalities in CYP health almost exclusively as socioeconomically patterned inequalities in health practices and outcomes. Strategies which participants perceived to reduce inequalities included: preventive support and early intervention, an early years/whole family focus, targeted working in local areas of high deprivation, organisational integration and whole system/place-based approaches. Despite demonstrating a commitment to a social determinants of health approach, efforts to reduce inequalities were described as thwarted by the prevalence of poverty and budget cuts which hindered the ability of local organisations to work together. Participants critiqued national policy which aimed to reduce inequalities in CYP health for failing to recognise local economic disparities and the interrelated nature of the determinants of health. CONCLUSIONS: Despite increased calls for a 'whole systems' approach to reducing inequalities in health, significant barriers to implementation remain. National governments need to work towards more joined up policy making, which takes into consideration regional disparities, allows for flexibility in interpretation and addresses the different and interrelated social determinants of health. Our findings have particular significance in light of Covid-19 and indicate the need for systems level policy responses and a health in all policies approach.","Holding, Eleanor; Fairbrother, Hannah; Griffin, Naomi; Wistow, Jonathan; Powell, Katie; Summerbell, Carolyn",BMC Public Health,,244

390861,Inclusion of Cephalexin in COVID-19 Treatment Combinations May Prevent Lung Involvement in Mild Infections: A Case Report with Pharmacological Genomics Perspective,2021,"Viral infections pose intense burdens to healthcare systems and global economies. The correct diagnosis of viral diseases represents a crucial step towards effective treatments and control. Biosensors have been successfully implemented as accessible and accurate detection tests for some of the most important viruses. While most biosensors are based on physical or chemical interactions of cell-free components, the complexity of living microorganisms holds a poorly explored potential for viral detection in the face of the advances of synthetic biology. Indeed, cell-based biosensors have been praised for their versatility and economic attractiveness, however, yeast platforms for viral disease diagnostics are still limited to indirect antibody recognition. Here we propose a novel strategy for viral detection in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which combines the transductive properties of G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) with the Yeast Surface Display (YSD) of specific enzymes enrolled in the viral recognition process. The GPCR/YSD complex might allow for active virus detection through a modulated signal activated by a GPCR agonist, whose concentration correlates to the viral titer. Additionally, we explore this methodology in a case study for the detection of highly pathogenic coronaviruses that share the same cell receptor upon infection (i.e. the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2, ACE2), as a conceptual example of the potential of the GPCR/YSD strategy for the diagnosis of COVID-19.","Maneira, Carla; Bermejo, Pamela Magalí; Pereira, Gonçalo Amarante Guimarães; de Mello, Fellipe da Silveira Bezerra",FEMS yeast res,,244

Insufficient insulin production causes an increase in blood glucose level that results in DM. To lower the blood glucose level, various drugs are employed that block the activity of the &#945;-glucosidase enzyme, which&nbsp;is considered responsible for the breakdown of polysaccharides into monosaccharides leading to an increase in the intestinal blood glucose level. We have synthesized novel 2-(3-(benzoyl/4-bromobenzoyl)-4-hydroxy-1,1-dioxido-2H-benzo[e][1,2]thiazin-2-yl)-N-arylacetamides and have screened them for their in silico and in vitro &#945;-glucosidase inhibition activity. The derivatives 11c, 12a, 12d, 12e, and 12g emerged as potent inhibitors of the &#945;-glucosidase enzyme. These compounds exhibited good docking scores and excellent binding interactions with the selected residues (Asp203, Asp542, Asp327, His600, Arg526) during in silico screening. Similarly, these compounds also showed good in vitro &#945;-glucosidase inhibitions with IC50 values of 30.65, 18.25, 20.76, 35.14, and 24.24 µM, respectively, which were better than the standard drug, acarbose (IC50 = 58.8 µM).

The International Dementia Alliance is a group of dementia specialists from six European countries and this paper is a summary of our experience of the effects of COVID-19 on our populations. Experience from England, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland highlight the differential response from health and social care systems and the measures taken to maximise support for older people and those with dementia. The common themes include recognition of the atypical presentation of COVID-19 in older people (and those with dementia) need to pay particular attention to the care of people with dementia in care homes; the recognition of the toll that isolation can bring on older people and the complexity of the response by health and social services to minimise the negative impact of the pandemic.

We discuss a less common presentation of COVID-19 in a patient where the use of telemedicine technology prevented the exposure of the healthcare team in an academic general pediatrics clinic. A medically complex 20-year-old male presented via virtual visit for unilateral eye redness and discharge. He received topical ophthalmic antibiotics for presumed acute bacterial conjunctivitis and was counseled on return precautions. Three days later, the patient developed shortness of breath, fever to 102.6°F, and chest pain. COVID-19 testing returned positive. Conjunctivitis is a presenting symptom in 32% of COVID-19 cases. Current evidence suggests that these patients may transmit their illness at the time of presentation. Using telehealth, we avoided exposure to a COVID-19-positive patient who would not have met criteria for testing or droplet precautions. Telehealth allows providers to triage patients, identifying those who need to be seen in person, thereby minimizing exposure. Transitioning toward virtual practice, particularly during a pandemic, prepares for the possibility of healthcare workers being quarantined but still able to provide care and minimizes exposure to asymptomatic patients or those with atypical symptoms.","Chavis, Antwon; Bakken, Hayes; Ellenby, Miles; Hasan, Reem",J Adolesc Health,,244

The antiviral activity of many plants including Azadirachta indica, Xylopia aethiopica and Allium cepa has been reported. The novel coronavirus disease is no exception among viral diseases in which plant compounds could serve as potent antagonist. Therefore, our study investigated the inhibitory potentials of Azadirachta indica and Xylopia aethiopica isolates against SARS-CoV-2 viral accessory proteins and the host serine protease. The protein data (SARS-CoV-2 Papain like protease (PLpro) (PDB: 6wx4), Chymotrypsin-like main protease (3CLpro) (PDB:6YB7), SARS-CoV nsp 12 (PDB: 6nus), Host cell protease (TMPRSS1) (PDB:5ce1) were obtained from the protein data bank (PDB), while the SDS format of each Ligands were obtained from Pubchem database. Molecular docking analysis was performed with Auto Dock Vina 1.5.6 and visualization of the interaction between the ligands and protein was done with discovery studio 2019. The ADMET prediction of pharmacokinetics and toxicity properties of the ligands was obtained using vNN Web Server. Our result showed that all the plant isolates demonstrated negative Gibb's free energy, indicating good binding affinity for both the viral and host protein. Overall, twenty-three of the forty-seven isolates showed good binding affinity comparable with dexamethasone that was used as reference drug. Although many of the compounds have good binding affinity for the viral and host proteins, based on the ADMET prediction, only Azadironic acid, Nimbionone, Nimbionol and Nimocinol all from A. indica could serve as potential drug candidate with good pharmacokinetics and toxicity profile. This study provides an insight into potential inhibitors and novel drug candidates for SARS-CoV-2. Further studies will look forward into the wet laboratory validation of Azadironic acid, Nimbionone, Nimbionol and Nimocinol against corona virus disease.

Several lines of evidence point to a substantial role of melatonin in the body's innate defense system including acting as a scavenger, an antioxidant and modulating the immune system. We therefore hypothesize that melatonin deficiency may predispose those ASD patients who have low melatonin output to COVID-19 disease.

It is clear that child disaster outcomes are worst among children of highly distressed caregivers, or those caregivers who experience their own negative mental health outcomes from the disaster. The current study used path analysis to examine concurrent patterns of parents' (n = 420) experience from a national sample during the early months of the U.S. COVID-19 pandemic. The results of a multi-group path analysis, organized by parent gender, indicate good fit to the data [X2(10) = 159.04, p < .01]. Results indicate significant linkages between parents' caregiver burden, mental health, and perceptions of children's stress; these in turn are significantly linked to child-parent closeness and conflict, indicating possible spillover effects for depressed parents and compensatory effects for anxious parents. The impact of millions of families sheltering in place during the COVID-19 pandemic for an undefined period of time may lead to unprecedented impacts on individuals' mental health with unknown impacts on child-parent relationships. These impacts may be heightened for families whose caregivers experience increased mental health symptoms, as was the case for fathers in the current sample.","Russell, B S; Hutchison, M; Tambling, R; Tomkunas, A J; Horton, A L",Child Psychiatry Hum Dev,,244

A significant proportion of patients with OSA in the UK are undiagnosed. This study aims to identify risk factors for OSA in an obese cohort. METHOD: A population-based study was conducted of obese patients (BMI &#8805; 30 kg/m2) from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). A logistic regression model was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) for developing OSA according to other clinicopathological characteristics. Multivariate analysis was conducted of individual factors that affect the propensity to develop OSA. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.050. RESULTS: From 276,600 obese patients identified during a data extraction of the CPRD in July 2017, the prevalence of OSA was 5.4%. The following risk factors were found to be independently associated with increased likelihood of OSA: male sex (OR = 3.273; p < 0.001), BMI class II (OR = 1.640; p < 0.001), BMI class III (OR = 3.768; p < 0.001), smoking (OR = 1.179; p < 0.001), COPD (OR = 1.722; p < 0.001), GERD (OR = 1.557; p < 0.001), hypothyroidism (OR = 1.311; p < 0.001), acromegaly (OR = 3.543; p < 0.001), and benzodiazepine use (OR = 1.492; p < 0.001). Bariatric surgery was associated with reduced risk of OSA amongst this obese population (OR = 0.260; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In obese patients, there are numerous comorbidities that are associated with increased likelihood of OSA. These factors can help prompt clinicians to identify undiagnosed OSA. Bariatric surgery appears to be protective against developing OSA.","Erridge, S; Moussa, O; McIntyre, C; Hariri, A; Tolley, N; Kotecha, B; Purkayastha, S",Obes. surg,,244

Two hundred fourteen confirmed COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized in the General Hospital of Central Theater Command of the People's Liberation Army between 18 January and 26 February 2020 were recruited. Two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits based on recombinant severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleocapsid protein (rN) and spike protein (rS) were used for detecting IgM and IgG antibodies, and their diagnostic feasibility was evaluated. Among the 214 patients, 146 (68.2%) and 150 (70.1%) were successfully diagnosed with the rN-based IgM and IgG ELISAs, respectively; 165 (77.1%) and 159 (74.3%) were successfully diagnosed with the rS-based IgM and IgG ELISAs, respectively. The positive rates of the rN-based and rS-based ELISAs for antibody (IgM and/or IgG) detection were 80.4% and 82.2%, respectively. The sensitivity of the rS-based ELISA for IgM detection was significantly higher than that of the rN-based ELISA. We observed an increase in the positive rate for IgM and IgG with an increasing number of days post-disease onset (d.p.o.), but the positive rate of IgM dropped after 35 d.p.o. The positive rate of rN-based and rS-based IgM and IgG ELISAs was less than 60% during the early stage of the illness, 0 to 10 d.p.o., and that of IgM and IgG was obviously increased after 10 d.p.o. ELISA has a high sensitivity, especially for the detection of serum samples from patients after 10 d.p.o., so it could be an important supplementary method for COVID-19 diagnosis.","Liu, Wanbing; Liu, Lei; Kou, Guomei; Zheng, Yaqiong; Ding, Yinjuan; Ni, Wenxu; Wang, Qiongshu; Tan, Li; Wu, Wanlei; Tang, Shi; Xiong, Zhou; Zheng, Shangen",J. clin. microbiol,,244

The aim of this review was to quantify the isolated effect of age on severe COVID-19 outcomes. We searched Pubmed to find relevant studies published in 2020. Two independent reviewers evaluated them using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. We extracted the results and assessed seven domains of bias for each study. After adjusting for important age-related risk factors, the isolated effect of age was estimated using meta-regression. Twelve studies met our inclusion criteria: four studies for COVID-19 disease severity, seven for mortality, and one for admission to ICU. The crude effect of age (5.2% and 13.4% higher risk of disease severity and death per age year, respectively) substantially decreased when adjusting for important age-dependent risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease/cerebrovascular disease, compromised immunity, previous respiratory disease, renal disease). Adjusting for all six comorbidities indicates a 2.7% risk increase for disease severity (two studies), and no additional risk of death per year of age (five studies). The indication of a rather weak influence of age on COVID-19 disease severity after adjustment for important age-dependent risk factors should be taken in consideration when implementing age-related preventative measures (e.g., age-dependent work restrictions).","Romero Starke, Karla; Petereit-Haack, Gabriela; Schubert, Melanie; Kämpf, Daniel; Schliebner, Alexandra; Hegewald, Janice; Seidler, Andreas",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,244

Adjuncts minimising exposure of healthcare workers to hazardous pathogens released during AGP may be beneficial. We used state-of-the-art computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling to optimise the performance of a custom-designed shield. METHODS: We modelled airflow patterns and trajectories of particles (size range 1-500 µm) emitted during a typical cough using CFD (ANSYS Fluent software, Canonsburg, PA, USA), in the presence and absence of a protective shield enclosing the head of a patient. We modelled the effect of different shield designs, suction tube position, and suction flow rate on particle escape from the shield. RESULTS: Use of the shield prevented escape of 99.1-100% of particles, which were either trapped on the shield walls (16-21%) or extracted via suction (79-82%). At most, 0.9% particles remained floating inside the shield. Suction flow rates (40-160 L min-1) had no effect on the final location of particles in a closed system. Particle removal from within the shield was optimal when a suction catheter was placed vertically next to the head of the patient. Addition of multiple openings in the shield reduced the purging performance from 99% at 160 L min-1 to 67% at 40 L min-1. CONCLUSION: CFD modelling provides information to guide optimisation of the efficient removal of hazardous pathogens released during AGP from a custom-designed shield. These data are essential to establish before clinical use, pragmatic clinical trials, or both.","Perella, Paolo; Tabarra, Mohammad; Hataysal, Ertan; Pournasr, Amir; Renfrew, Ian",Br. j. anaesth,,244
402950,Gastric Perforation with Omental Patch Repair: A Rare Complication of Pulmonary Resuscitation in COVID-19 Pneumonia,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United States, especially in New York City (NYC), led to a tremendous increase in hospitalizations and mortality. There is very limited data available that associates outcomes during hospitalization in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we reviewed the health records of patients with COVID-19 who were admitted from March 9-April 9, 2020, to a community hospital in NYC. Subjects with confirmed reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of the nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) were included. We collected data related to demographics, laboratory results, and outcome of hospitalization. Outcome was measured based on whether the patient was discharged home or died during hospitalization. RESULTS: There were 888 consecutive admissions with COVID-19 during the study period, of which 513 were excluded with pending outcome or incomplete information. We included a total of 375 patients in the study, of whom 215 (57%) survived and 160 (43%) died during hospitalization. The majority of patients were male (63%) and of Hispanic origin (66%) followed by Blacks (25%), and others (9%). Hypertension (60%) stands out to be the most common comorbidity followed by diabetes mellitus (47%), cardiovascular disease (17%), chronic kidney disease (17%), and human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (9%). On multiple regression analysis, increasing odds of mortality during hospitalization was associated with older age (odds ratio [OR] 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.06 per year increase; p < 0.0001), admission D-dimer more than 1000 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) (OR 3.16; 95% CI, 1.75-5.73; p<0.0001), admission C-reactive protein (CRP) levels of more than 200 milligrams per liter (mg/L) (OR 2.43; 95% CI, 1.36-4.34; p = 0.0028), and admission lymphopenia (OR 2.63; CI, 1.47-4.69; p 0.0010). CONCLUSION: In this retrospective cohort study originating in NYC, older age, admission levels of D-dimer of more than 1000 ng/mL, CRP of more than 200 mg/L and lymphopenia were associated with mortality in individuals hospitalized for COVID-19. We recommend using these risk factors on admission to triage patients to critical care units or surge units to maximize the use of surge capacity beds.","Chilimuri, Sridhar; Sun, Haozhe; Alemam, Ahmed; Mantri, Nikhitha; Shehi, Elona; Tejada, Jairo; Yugay, Alla; Nayudu, Suresh K",West J Emerg Med,,244
403307,COVID-19-associated acute pancreatitis: a rare cause of acute abdomen,2020,"Background: Seroprevalence studies are important tools to estimate the prevalence of prior or recent SARS-CoV-2 infections, identifying hotspots and high-risk groups and informing public health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a city-level seroprevalence study in Holyoke, Massachusetts, USA to estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and risk factors for seropositivity. Methods: We invited inhabitants of 2,000 randomly sampled addresses between November 5 and December 31, 2020. Participants completed questionnaires measuring sociodemographic and health characteristics, and COVID-19 exposure history, and provided dried blood spots for measurement of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies. We calculate total and subgroup seroprevalence estimates based on presence of IgG antibodies using a Bayesian procedure that incorporates uncertainty in antibody test sensitivity and specificity. We account for clustering by household and weighting based on demographic characteristics to ensure estimates represented the citys population. Findings: We enrolled 280 households including 472 individuals. 328 underwent antibody testing. The citywide seroprevalence estimate of SARS-CoV-2 IgG was 13.1% (95%CI 6.9-22.3) compared to 9.8% based on publicly reported case counts. Seroprevalence was 16.1% (95%CI 6.2-31.8) among individuals identifying as Hispanic compared to 9.4% (95%CI 4.6-16.4) among those identifying as non-Hispanic white. Seroprevalence was higher among Spanish speaking households (21.9%; 95% CI 8.3-43.9) compared to English speaking households (10.2%; 95% CI 5.2-18.0) and among individuals living in high vulnerability areas (14.4%; 95% CI 7.1-25.5) compared to low vulnerability areas (8.2%; 95% CI 3.1-16.9). Interpretation: The measured SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence of IgG antibodies in Holyoke was only 13.1% during the second surge of SARS-CoV-2 in this region, far from accepted thresholds for herd immunity. Already vulnerable communities were at highest risk of prior infection. Implementation of local serosurveys in tandem with proactive public health interventions that address disparities in SARS-CoV-2 exposure are crucial to ensure at-risk communities have appropriate educational materials and access to vaccines, testing, and timely treatment.","Matias, Wilfredo Rafael; Fulcher, Isabel R; Sauer, Sara M; Nolan, Cody P; Guillaume, Yodeline; Zhu, Jack; Molano, Francisco J; Uceta, Elizabeth; Collins, Shannon; Slater, Damien M; Sanchez, Vanessa M; Moheed, Serina; Harris, Jason B; Charles, Richelle C; Paxton, Ryan M; Gonsalves, Sean F; Franke, Molly F; Ivers, Louise C",,,244

Despite this, handwashing behavior remains low in the general public. Social marketing has been employed as a successful health promotion strategy for changing many health behaviors in the past. The present study examines if message framing influences the effectiveness of a handwashing health promotion messages at the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. In a between-subjects cross-sectional experiment, participants (N = 344) in the United States were randomly assigned to view one of four handwashing messages or a control message before completing self-report measures of attitudes, emotions, readiness to change, and behavioral intentions around handwashing. Simple handwashing messages were presented with different framings, including a simple exchange message, a gain message, a social norm appeal, and a guilt appeal. Results revealed that message type influenced handwashing behavioral intentions and emotions. Post-hoc comparisons revealed that the simple exchange message produced significantly higher intentions than other messages and that only the simple exchange message significantly differed from the control message on emotions regarding handwashing. Mediational analyses showed handwashing emotions fully mediated the relationship between messaging and handwashing intentions. This mediation effect was moderated by age, such that it occurred for the younger and middle age participants, but not older participants. These results suggest that even simple, brief, and easily conveyable messages can positively impact behavioral intentions around handwashing during the early stages of a health crisis. Consistent with recent research comparing affective and cognitive pathways for health behavior, the mediational analysis suggests that effect of the simple exchange message on intentions was due to increased positive emotions around handwashing.","Matkovic, John; Clemens, Kelly S; Faasse, Kate; Geers, Andrew L",Front Public Health,,244

A large proportion of ""COVID-survivors"" - and not only elderly patients - suffers from ""post-COVID-syndrome"". Risk factors are preexisting somatic multimorbidity, cognitive and cerebral changes together with pneumonia and hypoxemia, intensive care treatment and confusional states during the acute phase of illness. Post-COVID cognitive deficits usually manifest as a frontal dysexecutive syndrome combined with fatigue and dysphoria and/or with attentional and memory deficits. Several pathogenetic mechanisms of COVID encephalopathy are understood, but no specific treatment strategies have been established so far. We assume that general practitioners, psychiatrists, neurologists and social workers will need to take care of the activation, reintegration and expert appraisals of patients with post-COVID fatigue and cognitive deficits during the years to come.","Berlit, Peter; Frölich, Lutz; Förstl, Hans",Dtsch Med Wochenschr,,244

410903,Advanced Electrocardiography Accurately identifies Long QT Syndrome and Genetic Subtype,2020,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been declared a global pandemic and urgent treatment and prevention strategies are needed. Nitazoxanide, an anthelmintic drug, has been shown to exhibit in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2. The present study used physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling to inform optimal doses of nitazoxanide capable of maintaining plasma and lung tizoxanide exposures above the reported SARS-CoV-2 EC90 . METHODS: A whole-body PBPK model was validated against available pharmacokinetic data for healthy individuals receiving single and multiple doses between 500 and 4000 mg with and without food. The validated model was used to predict doses expected to maintain tizoxanide plasma and lung concentrations above the EC90 in >90% of the simulated population. PopDes was used to estimate an optimal sparse sampling strategy for future clinical trials. RESULTS: The PBPK model was successfully validated against the reported human pharmacokinetics. The model predicted optimal doses of 1200 mg QID, 1600 mg TID and 2900 mg BID in the fasted state and 700 mg QID, 900 mg TID and 1400 mg BID when given with food. For BID regimens an optimal sparse sampling strategy of 0.25, 1, 3 and 12 hours post dose was estimated. CONCLUSION: The PBPK model predicted tizoxanide concentrations within doses of nitazoxanide already given to humans previously. The reported dosing strategies provide a rational basis for design of clinical trials with nitazoxanide for the treatment or prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A concordant higher dose of nitazoxanide is now planned for investigation in the seamless phase I/IIa AGILE trial.","Rajoli, Rajith K R; Pertinez, Henry; Arshad, Usman; Box, Helen; Tatham, Lee; Curley, Paul; Neary, Megan; Sharp, Joanne; Liptrott, Neill J; Valentijn, Anthony; David, Christopher; Rannard, Steven P; Aljayyoussi, Ghaith; Pennington, Shaun H; Hill, Andrew; Boffito, Marta; Ward, Steve A; Khoo, Saye H; Bray, Patrick G; O039,; Neill, Paul M; Hong, W David; Biagini, Giancarlo; Owen, Andrew",,,244

The aim of this study to provide evidence on Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine side effects which is approved by the United Arab Emirates (UAE). MethodsA cross-sectional survey study was conducted between January and April 2021 to collect data on the effects of COVID-19 vaccine among individuals in the UAE. Demographic data, chronic conditions, side effects of the 1st and 2nd dose toward the vaccination, and the response of unwilling taking COVID-19 vaccine were reported. ResultsThe most common side effects of post 1st dose vaccination among participants ([≤]49 years old vs >49 years) were normal injection site pain 42.2%, fatigue 12.2%, and headache 9.6%, while pain at the vaccination site 32.6%, fatigue16.3%, lethargy13.7%, headache10%, and tenderness 10% were the most side effects of the post 2nd dose of vaccination in both groups. All the side effects in both doses were more prevalent among the participants [≤] 49-year-old group. Among two groups (females vs males), the study revealed the increase in the number of females that suffered from the vaccine side effects compared with males in both doses. The most prevalence adverse reactions of first dose in (females vs males) were fatigue (15.8% vs 3.75%), lethargy (12.6% vs 1.25%), headache (10.5% vs 7.5%), while in 2nd dose were fatigue (20% vs 7.5%), sever injection site pain (10.5% vs 2.5%). The most common reason of not willing to take the COVID-19 vaccine among the participants were the vaccines are not effective, and the participants were not authorized to take vaccine. ConclusionThe 1st and 2nd dose post-vaccination side effects were mild, predictable, and there were no hospitalization cases, this data will help to reduce the vaccine hesitancy.","Qubais, Balsam; Al-Shahrabi, Rula; Alhaj, Shaikha Salah; Alkokhardi, Zainab Mansour; Adrees, Ahmed Omar",,,244

415570,Measuring grip strength in COVID-19: A simple way to predict overall frailty/impairment,2020,"We consider the pandemic spread of COVID-19 in selected countries after the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in Wuhan City, China. We estimated the infection rate and the initial individuals infected with COVID-19 by using officially reported data from the early stages of the epidemic for a model of susceptible (S), infectible (I), quarantined (Q), and officially confirmed recovered (R k) populations (the so-called SIQR kmodel). In the officially reported data, we know the number of quarantined cases and the officially reported number of recovered cases. We cannot know about recovered cases from asymptomatic patients. In the SIQR kmodel, we can estimate the parameters and the initial infections (confirmed cases + asymptomatic cases) from fitted values. We obtained an infection rate in the range β = 0.233 ~ 0.462, a basic reproduction number of R o= 1.8 ~ 3.5, and the initial number of infected individuals, I (0) = 10 ~ 8409, for selected countries. By using fitting parameters, we estimated that the maximum time span of the infection was around 50 days in Germany when the government invoked the quarantine policy. The disease is expected to subside about 6 months after the first patients are found.","Chae, Seo Yoon; Lee, KyoungEun; Lee, Hyun Min; Jung, Nam; Le, Quang Anh; Mafwele, Biseko Juma; Lee, Tae Ho; Kim, Doo Hwan; Lee, Jae Woo",Front.

We performed a cell culture-based neutralization assay focusing on authentic SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.617.1 (Kappa), B.1.617.2 (Delta), B.1.427/B.1.429 (Epsilon), all harboring the spike substitution L452R. We found that authentic SARS-CoV-2 variants harboring L452R had reduced susceptibility to convalescent and vaccine-elicited sera and mAbs. Compared to B.1, Kappa and Delta showed a reduced neutralization by convalescent sera by a factor of 8.00 and 5.33, respectively, which constitutes a 2-fold greater reduction when compared to Epsilon. BNT2b2 and mRNA1273 vaccine-elicited sera were less effective against Kappa, Delta, and Epsilon compared to B.1. No difference was observed between Kappa and Delta towards vaccine-elicited sera, whereas convalescent sera were 1.5-fold less effective against Delta, respectively. Both B.1.617 variants Kappa (+E484Q) and Delta (+T478K) were less susceptible to either casirivimab or imdevimab. In conclusion, in contrast to the parallel circulating Kappa variant, the neutralization efficiency of convalescent and vaccine-elicited sera against Delta was moderately reduced. Delta was resistant to imdevimab, which however, might be circumvented by a combination therapy with casirivimab together.","Wilhelm, Alexander; Toptan, Tuna; Pallas, Christiane; Wolf, Timo; Goetsch, Udo; Gottschalk, Rene; Vehreschild, Maria JGT; Ciesek, Sandra; Widera, Marek",,,244

Here we combine single-molecule spectroscopy with all-atom simulations to uncover the molecular details that contribute to N protein function. N protein contains three dynamic disordered regions that house putative transiently-helical binding motifs. The two folded domains interact minimally such that full-length N protein is a flexible and multivalent RNA-binding protein. N protein also undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation when mixed with RNA, and polymer theory predicts that the same multivalent interactions that drive phase separation also engender RNA compaction. We offer a simple symmetry-breaking model that provides a plausible route through which single-genome condensation preferentially occurs over phase separation, suggesting that phase separation offers a convenient macroscopic readout of a key nanoscopic interaction.","Cubuk, Jasmine; Alston, Jhullian J; Incicco, J Jeremías; Singh, Sukrit; Stuchell-Brereton, Melissa D; Ward, Michael D; Zimmerman, Maxwell I; Vithani, Neha; Griffith, Daniel; Wagoner, Jason A; Bowman, Gregory R; Hall, Kathleen B; Soranno, Andrea; Holehouse, Alex S",Nat Commun,,244

AIM: To explore whether COVID-19 pandemic fears are associated with obsessive-compulsive symptoms and vice versa in adolescents with preexisting mental and behavioural disorders. METHODS: A questionnaire-based cross-sectional study among adolescents with pre-existing mental disorders. The extent of worrying related to the COVID-19 pandemic was measured using the COVID-19 inventory whereas obsessive-compulsive symptoms were assessed using the obsessive-compulsive inventory-revised (OCI-R). Pearson correlation coefficient (r) was used to explore the relationship between COVID-19 pandemic fears and the development of obsessive-compulsive symptoms. RESULTS: A total of 57 patients out of 63 participants (90.4%) had a COVID-19 inventory score of 12 or higher suggesting that a vast majority of young people with mental disorders had significant pandemic-related worries. Out of these 57 patients, over half (31) had an OCI-R modified score of 17 or higher indicating significant obsessive-compulsive symptoms.

420053,COVID-19 and Kidney Disease Disparities in the United States,2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 has affected the health of people across the globe. Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) have a significant relationship with COVID-19, both as a risk factor and prognostic indicator, and as a complication of the disease itself. In addition to predisposing to CVD complications, the ongoing pandemic has severely affected the delivery of timely and appropriate care for cardiovascular conditions resulting in increased mortality. The etiology behind the cardiac injury associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 is likely varied, including coronary artery disease, microvascular thrombosis, myocarditis, and stress cardiomyopathy. Further large-scale investigations are needed to better determine the underlying mechanism of myocardial infarction and other cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients and to determine the incidence of each type of cardiac injury in this patient population. Telemedicine and remote monitoring technologies can play an important role in optimizing outcomes in patients with established CVD. In this article, we summarize the various impacts that COVID-19 has on the cardiovascular system, including myocardial infarction, myocarditis, stress cardiomyopathy, thrombosis, and stroke.","Greenberg, Arielle; Pemmasani, Gayatri; Yandrapalli, Srikanth; Frishman, William H",Cardiol Rev,,244

The aim of this study was to investigate whether older adults reported cancellation or avoidance of medical care during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to explore associations with health and socio-demographic characteristics. METHODS: Cross-sectional data of 880 older adults aged &#8805; 62 years (mean age 73.4 years, 50.3% female) were used from the COVID-19 questionnaire of the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam, a cohort study among community-dwelling older adults in the Netherlands. Cancellation and avoidance of care were assessed by self-report, and covered questions on cancellation of primary care (general practitioner), cancellation of hospital outpatient care, and postponed help-seeking. Respondent characteristics included age, sex, educational level, loneliness, depression, anxiety, frailty, multimorbidity and information on quarantine. RESULTS: 35% of the sample reported cancellations due to the COVID-19 situation, either initiated by the respondent (12%) or by healthcare professionals (29%). Postponed help-seeking was reported by 8% of the sample. Multimorbidity was associated with healthcare-initiated cancellations (primary care OR = 1.92, 95% CI = 1.09-3.50; hospital OR = 1.86, 95% CI = 1.28-2.74) and respondent-initiated hospital outpatient cancellations (OR = 2.02, 95% CI = 1.04-4.12). Depressive symptoms were associated with postponed help-seeking (OR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.06-1.24). CONCLUSION: About one third of the study sample reported cancellation or avoidance of medical care during the first months of the pandemic, and this was more common among those with multiple chronic conditions. How this impacts outcomes in the long term should be investigated in future research.","Schuster, Noah A; de Breij, Sascha; Schaap, Laura A; van Schoor, Natasja M; Peters, Mike J L; de Jongh, Renate T; Huisman, Martijn; Hoogendijk, Emiel O",,,244
420545,Imatinib for COVID-19: A case report,2020,"Between the end of the nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth century, the city of Siena experienced elevated tuberculosis-related morbidity and mortality, to the point that on January 1, 1929 the newspaper La Nazione wrote that ""Siena ranks second in the official Tuberculosis (TB) incidence rate"". The author presents statistical data relating to a time span ranging from 1898 to 1935, interpreting them in light of social and sanitary conditions found in the city. The result is an exhaustive picture of the most important actions implemented at city level to prevent tuberculosis and to assist and treat the sick, such as: the creation of seaside hospices conceived by Carlo Livi for children suffering from scrofula, as well as centers committed to the prevention of childhood poverty and malnutrition; the realization of activities in the green areas of the ramparts of the Fortress, upon recommendation by the great hygienist Achille Sclavo; the establishment of a Preventorium on the premises of the Monastery of Santa Maria Maddalena to accommodate children from families that included pulmonary tuberculosis patients, and countless activities carried out by the Anti-TB Dispensary. Of particular interest is the identification of the main cause of high TB incidence in the unhealthy houses located in some areas of Siena's district, which, in 1930 engendered a lively debate hinging upon the notion of building restoration.","Orsini, D",J Prev Med Hyg,,244

The clinical manifestations of arboviral diseases, especially dengue fever, can be very similar to COVID-19, and misdiagnoses are still a reality. In the meantime, outcomes for patients and healthcare systems in situations of possible syndemic have not yet been clarified. OBJECTIVE: We set out to conduct a systematic review to understand and summarize the evidence relating to clinical manifestations, disease severity and prognoses among patients coinfected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and arboviruses. METHODS: We conducted a rapid systematic review with meta-analysis, on prospective and retrospective cohorts, case-control studies and case series of patients with confirmed diagnoses of SARS-CoV-2 and arboviral infection. We followed the Cochrane Handbook recommendations. We searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, LILACS, Scopus and Web of Science to identify published, ongoing and unpublished studies. We planned to extract data and assess the risk of bias and the certainty of evidence of the studies included, using the Quality in Prognosis Studies tool and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment. RESULTS: We were able to retrieve 2,407 citations using the search strategy, but none of the studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. CONCLUSION: The clinical presentations, disease severity and prognoses of patients coinfected with SARS-CoV-2 and arboviruses remain unclear.

422372,"A176 the Impact of Covid-19 on Anxiety, Depression, and Stress in Women with Inflammatory Bowel Disease: a Cross-sectional Survey",2021,"OBJECTIVE: While COVID-19 symptoms impact rhinology (anosmia) and laryngology (airways), two major disciplines of the otolaryngology armamentarium, the virus has seemed to spare the auditory system. A recent study, however, reported changes in otoacoustic emission (OAE) signals measured in SARS-COV-2 positive patients. We sought to assess the effect of COVID-19 infection on auditory performance in a cohort of recovered SARS-COV-2 patients and controls. To avoid a potential bias of previous audiological dysfunction not related to SARS-COV-2 infection, the study encompasses patients with normal auditory history. We hypothesized that if SARS-COV-2 infection predisposes to hearing loss, we would observe subtle and early audiometric deficits in our cohort in the form of subclinical auditory changes. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: The Institutional Review Board approved the study and we recruited participants who had been positive for SARS-COV-2 infection, according to an Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test on two nasopharyngeal swabs. The patients included in this study were asymptomatic for the SARS-COV-2 infection and were evaluated following recovery, confirmed by repeated swab testing. The control group comprised healthy individuals matched for age and sex, and with a normal auditory and otologic history. INTERVENTIONS: The eligibility to participate in this study included a normal audiogram, no previous auditory symptoms, normal otoscopy examination with an intact tympanic membrane, and bilateral tympanometry type A. None of our volunteers reported any new auditory symptoms following SARS-COV-2 infection. Ototacoustic emissions (OAE) and auditory brainstem response (ABR) measurements were used to evaluate the auditory function. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: OAE and ABR measurements. RESULTS: We have found no significant differences between recovered asymptomatic SARS-COV-2 patients and controls in any of transitory evoked otoacoustic emission (TEOAE), distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE), or ABR responses. CONCLUSIONS: There is no cochlear dysfunction represented by ABR, TEOAE, and DPOAE responses in recovered COVID-19 asymptomatic patients. Retrocochlear function was also preserved as evident by the ABR responses. A long-term evaluation of a larger cohort of SARS-COV-2 patients will help to identify a possible contribution of SARS-COV-2 infection to recently published anecdotal auditory symptoms associated with COVID-19.","Dror, Amiel A; Kassis-Karayanni, Najla; Oved, Adi; Daoud, Amani; Eisenbach, Netanel; Mizrachi, Matti; Rayan, Doaa; Francis, Shawky; Layous, Eli; Gutkovich, Yoni Evgeni; Taiber, Shahar; Srouji, Samer; Chordekar, Shai; Goldenstein, Sonia; Ziv, Yael; Ronen, Ohad; Gruber, Maayan; Avraham, Karen B; Sela, Eyal",Otol Neurotol,,244

A cross-sectional cohort study,2021,"INTRODUCTION: We are currently in the midst of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Research into previous infectious disease outbreaks has shown that healthcare workers are at increased risk for burnout during these dire times, with those on the front lines at greatest risk. The purpose of this prospective study was to determine the effect that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the wellness of emergency physicians (EP). METHODS: A survey was sent to 137 EPs in a multi-hospital network in eastern Pennsylvania. We compared 10 primary and two supplemental questions based on how the physicians had been feeling in the prior 2-3 weeks (COVID-19 period) to the same questions based on how they were feeling in the prior 4-6 months (pre-COVID-19 period). RESULTS: We received 55 responses to the survey (40.1% response rate). The study found that during the pandemic, EPs felt less in control (p-value = 0.001); felt decreased happiness while at work (p-value 0.001); had more trouble falling asleep (p-value = 0.001); had an increased sense of dread when thinking of work needing to be done (p-value = 0.04); felt more stress on days not at work (p-value <0.0001); and were more concerned about their own health (p-value <0.0001) and the health of their families and loved ones (p-value <0.0001). CONCLUSION: This study showed a statistically significant decrease in EP wellness during the COVID-19 pandemic when compared to the pre-pandemic period.

While new infections are not usually observed directly, they can be estimated from data. However, data may be delayed and potentially biased. We investigated the sensitivity of Rt estimates to different data sources representing COVID-19 in England, and we explored how this sensitivity could track epidemic dynamics in population sub-groups. We sourced public data on test-positive cases, hospital admissions and deaths with confirmed COVID-19 in seven regions of England over March through August 2020. We estimated Rt using a model that mapped unobserved infections to each data source. We then compared differences in Rt with the demographic and social context of surveillance data over time. Our estimates of transmission potential varied for each data source, with the relative inconsistency of estimates varying across regions and over time. Rt estimates based on hospital admissions and deaths were more spatio-temporally synchronous than when compared to estimates from all test positives. We found these differences may be linked to biased representations of subpopulations in each data source. These included spatially clustered testing, and where outbreaks in hospitals, care homes, and young age groups reflected the link between age and severity of the disease. We highlight that policy makers could better target interventions by considering the source populations of Rt estimates. Further work should clarify the best way to combine and interpret Rt estimates from different data sources based on the desired use.

431766,The Outbreak of COVID-19 in Italy: Fighting the Pandemic,2020,"Objectives: Research on conspiracy theories (CT) has increased significantly in recent years. Studies come from various disciplines in the field of the humanities and social sciences. They show in particular that adherence to CT rebounds at every moment of ""crisis"". The health crisis we are experiencing is no exception: COVID-19 pandemic entails an ""infodemic"", according to Tedros Ghebreyesus, General Director of the World Health Organization. Indeed, we are witnessing the production, and international dissemination, of false informations, including conspiracy explanations of the coronavirus and its consequences. This outbreak of CT is an opportunity to examine the psychological and psychopathological issues of this phenomenon in the face of the ""crisis"", whether collective or individual, health or existential. Methodology: We present a review of the important international scientific literature regarding CT related to the health crisis of the COVID-19. Results: Work that addresses CT related to the COVID-19 crisis has resulted in more than fifty publications in recent months. This research is mainly in the fields of social psychology, medical psychology, differential psychology, political science and public health. The rates of adherence to CT related to COVID-19 are of great concern. The literature mentions predisposing factors to the adherence or diffusion of CT on COVID-19: inclination for CT in general, low level of education, low knowledge of the disease, high level of anxiety, acceptance of xenophobic policies, unfavourable attitude towards marginal groups, nationalist stance. Unsurprisingly, there is widespread agreement in the literature that the conspiracy-prone fringe of the population is less likely to comply with government recommendations related to contamination risks, such as handwashing, social distancing, wearing masks, and using diagnostic tests. This crisis thus demonstrates once again that the circulation of false news and adherence to CT is not just a marginal and inconsequential thinking: it concerns a very large part of the population, with a potentially tragic impact in terms of public health. While there is usually no significant difference in adherence to CT according to gender, it would seem that women are less affected by CT related to the COVID than men, regardless of their political affiliation. Finally, studies on the links between adherence to COVID-related CT and stress levels do not seem to reach a consensus. The same uncertainty can be found in work on other types of CT. Conclusion: These results suggest that in order to understand the psychological causes of CT, it may be useful to address the psychodynamic issues underlying adherence to these beliefs. In particular, a psychopathological approach to this phenomenon enables to understand these beliefs as a defensive solution to cope with psychic vulnerability. CT involves overproducing meaning, as delusion does: CT can be considered as the collective, cultural equivalent of a delusional production. Moreover, it is impervious to arguments and evidences, in the same manner as delusion. However, it differs from it by at least two major characteristics: it is shareable and socializing; it gives rise to a consistent attitude.","Poupart, Florent; Bouscail, Manon",Ann. med.-psychol,,244

The disease which is caused by the virus is termed COVID-19. In most cases, it presents at first like common flu with cough and other respiratory symptoms. Nevertheless, other symptoms have been reported, such as a feeling of extreme fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms, or acute onset of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction. Here we report a series of 10 cases (1 male, 9 females) observed between February and April 2020, with an undulating appearance and disappearance of symptoms. Weeks passed before the diagnosis was established. Symptoms resolved rapidly after treatment with hydroxychloroquine. It seems that the course of COVID-19 can be mild or moderate but with a long persistence of symptoms, and may therefore remain obscure. This may cause a public health issue because of the long infectivity of these patients.","Sofian, Masoomeh; Velayati, Ali Akbar; Banifazl, Mohammad; Fotouhi, Fatemeh; Sadat Larijani, Mona; Afzali, Neda; Ramezani, Amitis",Wien Med Wochenschr,,244

The present study was done to assess the mental health and stress reactivity among the resident doctors who have been working for a prolonged duration during covid 19 pandemic in India. Methods: The subjects included 162 young resident doctors both males and females, of age group between 25-30 y, among which 92 were posted in covid wards on a rotation basis from 1st April 2020 to 31st December 2020 and 70 were doing duty in regular non-covid wards or not had done even a single duty in covid ward during the above period. All participants completed an online questionnaire that included the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)–II, Connor-Davidson resilience scale (CDRISC) and Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS) followed by a cold pressor test to assess stress reactivity. Results: There were significant differences in the mental health and stress reactivity scores with lower resilience scores, lower social support rating scores, increased anxiety and depression in Covid ward doctors (p=0.001). Conclusion: The findings suggested high levels of training, resilience helpful social support and unbiased work culture were necessary to health care workers engaged in public health emergence.","Kumar, S.; Banerjee, A.; Ahmad, A.",International Journal of Current Pharmaceutical Research,,244

We retrospectively evaluated the clinical courses of 12 COVID-19 patients who received IVIG at various stages of their illness, including within the first 72 h of clinical presentation, after initiation of mechanical ventilation, and after prolonged ventilation and ICU stay. The patients included 9 men and 3 women with a median age of 50 years (range 23-74), median Charlson Comorbidity Score of 2 (range 0-7), and median Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation Score of 13 (range 5-33) at the time of IVIG. The IVIG total dose ranged from 0.5 to 2.0 g/kg (median 1.25 g/kg) distributed over 1-4 daily doses. The most common regimen received was 0.5 g/kg daily for 3 days. The median time to IVIG administration was 9 days (range 0-48 days) after admission. The median time from first IVIG dose administration to hospital discharge was 14 days (range 3-48). The 5 patients who received IVIG &#8804;4 days of admission demonstrated a significantly shorter length of hospital stay after treatment (median 7 days, range 3-14 days) than the 7 patients who received it >7 days after admission (median 33 days, range 8-48 days, p = 0.03, Mann-Whitney U test). These cases demonstrate that IVIG may improve the clinical state of patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 infection. Despite very high illness severity scores, all patients survived hospital discharge. No thrombotic events occurred and IVIG was well tolerated, despite most cases demonstrating very elevated D-dimer suggestive of active intravascular fibrinolysis. We believe that IVIG warrants immediate clinical trial evaluation in COVID-19 to confirm its role as a mainstay treatment of moderate to severe COVID-19 infection as a means to reduce hospital stay and utilization of ICU resources, including mechanical ventilation, and potentially reduce mortality.","Herth, Felix J F; Sakoulas, George; Haddad, Fadi",Respiration,,244

COVID-19 clinical presentations cover a wide range from asymptomatic to severe illness and death. Given the limited therapeutic resources and unexpected clinical features of the disease, readily accessible predictive biomarkers are urgently needed to improve patient care and management. We asked the degree to which anemia may influence the outcome of patients with COVID-19. To this end, we identified 3777 patients who were positively diagnosed with COVID-19 between March 1 and April 1 2020 in New York City. We evaluated 2,562 patients with available red blood cell, hemoglobin, and related laboratory values. Multivariable cox proportional hazards regression showed that anemia was a significant independent predictor of mortality (hazard ratio (HR): 1.26, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.06-1.51), independent of age, sex, and comorbidities. There was a direct correlation between the degree of anemia and the risk of mortality when hemoglobin was treated as a continuous variable (HRadj 1.05; [CI]: 1.01-1.09). The hemoglobin level that was maximally predictive of mortality, was 11.5 g/dL in males and 11.8 g/dL in females. These findings identify a routinely measured biomarker that is predictive of disease outcomes and will aid in refining clinical care algorithms and optimize resource allocation. Mechanisms of impacts of anemia on COVID-19 outcome are likely to be multiple in nature and require further investigation.","Tremblay, Douglas; Rapp, Joseph L; Alpert, Naomi; Lieberman-Cribbin, Wil; Mascarenhas, John; Taioli, Emanuela; Ghaffari, Saghi",,,244

Scholars of the political ecology of disasters have sought to denaturalize so-called “natural” disasters by demonstrating their uneven consequences. Work in the political ecology of health similarly accounts for how risk of illness and disease are socio-economically mediated. While this scholarship has demonstrated the need to contextualize the unequal fallout from ecological and health disasters in ways that reveal the festering wounds of structural inequality, we know much less about how hope is cultivated in moments of crisis. The current revelatory moment of the COVID-19 pandemic offers an opportunity to find hope in the rubble through the deconstruction of framings of crisis as “error” and by homing in on the current and potential role of tourism to contribute to a more socially and environmentally just society.

METHODS: This study was a retrospective national cohort study of veterans diagnosed with opioid use disorder (OUD) receiving buprenorphine treatment from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) in fiscal years 2012-2019. The study examined trends in use of tele-buprenorphine and compared demographic and clinical characteristics in patients who received tele-buprenorphine versus those who received in-person treatment only. RESULTS: Utilization of tele-buprenorphine increased from 2.29% of buprenorphine patients in FY2012 (n = 187) to 7.96% (n = 1352) in FY2019 in VHA veterans nationally. Compared to patients receiving only in-person care, tele-buprenorphine patients were less likely to be male (AOR = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.73-0.98) or Black (AOR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.45-0.65). Tele-buprenorphine patients were more likely to be treated in community-based outpatient clinics rather than large medical centers (AOR = 2.91, 95% CI: 2.67-3.17) and to live in rural areas (AOR = 2.12, 95% CI:1.92-2.35). The median days supplied of buprenorphine treatment was 722 (interquartile range: 322-1459) among the tele-buprenorphine patients compared to 295 (interquartile range: 67-854) among patients who received treatment in-person. CONCLUSIONS: Use of telemedicine to deliver buprenorphine treatment in VHA increased 3.5-fold between 2012 and 2019, though overall use remained low prior to COVID-19. Tele-buprenorphine is a promising modality especially when treatment access is limited. However, we must continue to understand how practitioners and patient are using telemedicine and how these patients' outcomes compare to those using in-person care.","Lin, Lewei A; Fortney, John C; Bohnert, Amy S B; Coughlin, Lara N; Zhang, Lan; Piette, John D",J Subst Abuse Treat,,244

Systemic analysis across 36 tissues revealed a rank list of candidate cells potentially vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2. The top targets are lung AT2 cells and macrophages, then cardiomyocytes and adrenal gland stromal cells, followed by stromal cells in testis, ovary and thyroid. Whereas, the kidney proximal tubule cells, cholangiocytes and enterocytes are less likely to be the primary SARS-CoV-2 targets.

439934,[Intractable Airsickness Associated with COVID-19 Infection: A Case Report],2020,"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the incidence and clinical significance of sodium, potassium and calcium electrolyte disturbances in elderly patients with hip fracture before an operation. METHODS: The clinical data of 220 patients with intertrochanteric fracture and 261 patients with femoral neck fracture from September 2013 to December 2016 in our hospital (&#8805;60 years old) was reviewed. The sodium, potassium and calcium values, and the underlying diseases of patients were recorded after the first blood test. These patients were divided into two groups according to the fracture site: femoral neck fracture group and intertrochanteric fracture group. Then, the differences between these two groups were compared to analyze the proportion of electrolyte disturbances in elderly patients with hip fracture, and explore its clinical significance. RESULTS: Patients with intertrochanteric fractures were older than patients with femoral neck fracture. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of underlying diseases between these two groups. The incidence of hyponatremia, hypokalemia and hypocalcemia was 10.0%, 32.9% and 1.4%, respectively, in the femoral neck fracture group, and 24.3%, 21.1% and 7.7%, respectively, in the intertrochanteric fracture group. The incidence of hypernatremia, hyperkalemia and hypercalcemia was 1.4%, 1.4% and 0.9%, respectively, in the femoral neck fracture group, and 1.1%, 0.7% and 0.8%, respectively, in the intertrochanteric fracture group. CONCLUSION: Patients with old hip fractures before an operation are prone to hyponatremia, hypokalemia and hypocalcemia, and most of them have mild electrolyte disorders, which needs to be corrected in time. Furthermore, some patients urgently need urgent supplementation ofblood electrolytes for some diseases, the correction of electrolyte disorders, and the prevention of serious adverse consequences.

Brain pericytes in the peri-infarct area express macrophage markers in response to injury stimuli and are involved in neovascularization. In the kidney, nerve/glial antigen 2 (NG2)+ pericytes have been found to accumulate after renal injury. These accumulated NG2+ cells are not involved in scar formation. However, the role of accumulated NG2+ cells in injured kidneys remains unknown. Here, using a reversible ischemic reperfusion model, we found that renal NG2+ cells were increased in injured kidneys and expressed macrophage markers (CD11b or F4/80) on day 3 after reperfusion. Isolated NG2+ cells from ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) kidneys also had phagocytic activity and expressed anti-inflammatory cytokine genes, including mannose receptor and IL-10. These macrophage-like NG2+ cells did not likely differentiate into myofibroblasts because they did not increase &#945;-SMA expression. Intravenous transfusion of renal NG2+ cells isolated from donor mice on day 3 after reperfusion into recipient mice on day 1 after I/R surgery revealed that NG2+ cell-injected mice had lower plasma blood urea nitrogen, reduced KIM-1 mRNA expression, ameliorated renal damage, and reduced cellular debris accumulation than PBS-injected mice on day 5 after reperfusion. In conclusion, these data suggest that renal NG2+ cells have an M2 macrophage-like ability and play a novel role in facilitating the recovery process after renal I/R injury.","Kittikulsuth, Wararat; Nakano, Daisuke; Kitada, Kento; Suzuki, Norio; Yamamoto, Masayuki; Nishiyama, Akira","Am. j. physiol., Renal fluid electrolyte physiol",,244

Prosthetic joints are unfortunately inherently susceptible to bacterial infection accompanied by biofilm formation. Accurate and rapid diagnosis is vital to increase therapeutic success. Yet, established diagnostic modalities cannot directly detect bacterial biofilms on prostheses. Therefore, the present study was aimed at investigating whether arthroscopic optical imaging can accurately detect bacterial biofilms on prosthetic joints. METHODS: Here, we applied a conjugate of the antibiotic vancomycin and the near-infrared fluorophore IRDye800CW, in short vanco-800CW, in combination with arthroscopic optical imaging to target and visualize biofilms on infected prostheses. RESULTS: We show in a human post-mortem prosthetic knee infection model that a staphylococcal biofilm is accurately detected in real time and distinguished from sterile sections in high resolution. In addition, we demonstrate that biofilms associated with the clinically most relevant bacterial species can be detected using vanco-800CW. CONCLUSION: The presented image-guided arthroscopic approach provides direct visual diagnostic information and facilitates immediate appropriate treatment selection.","Schoenmakers, Jorrit W A; Heuker, Marjolein; López-Álvarez, Marina; Nagengast, Wouter B; van Dam, Gooitzen M; van Dijl, Jan Maarten; Jutte, Paul C; van Oosten, Marleen",Eur. j. nucl. med. mol. imaging,,244

The model is a Poisson autoregression of the daily new observed cases and dynamically adapt its estimates to explain the evolution of contagion in terms of a short-term and long-term dependence of case counts, allowing for a comparative evaluation of health policy measures. We have applied the model to 2020 data from the countries most hit by the virus. Our empirical findings show that the proposed model describes the evolution of contagion dynamics and determines whether contagion growth can be affected by health policies. Based on our findings, we can draw two health policy conclusions that can be useful for all countries in the world.

This prospective, double-blinded, randomized parallel-controlled interventional clinical trial investigated the effect of antioxidant supplements on inflammatory cytokines and disease progression in non-critically ill patients. A total of 87 hospitalized COVID-19 patients were randomized using computer-generated-randomization into the supplement group (n = 18) and the placebo group (n = 16) for 10 days. Baseline and final nutritional screening via nutrition risk screening (NRS-2002) and subjective global assessment (SGA), as well as the recording of anthropometric, clinical, biochemical, and functional parameters, were done. Serum ferritin level, cytokine storm parameters such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1(MCP-1), C-reactive protein, total leukocyte count, lymphocytic count, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio were measured. Anthropometric and clinical parameters showed nonsignificant differences between groups. The hematology profile showed improvement in lymphocyte count in the supplement group. However, levels of alkaline phosphatase, IL-6, TNF-α, and MCP-1 were significantly lower in the supplement group. In conclusion, antioxidant oral supplementation significantly reduced the cytokine storm and led to partial improvements in clinical parameters among patients with non-critical COVID-19.","Abulmeaty, Mahmoud M.

The conference focussed on how the arts and cultural sectors in Southeast Asia have been navigating the challenges caused by Covid-19. By showcasing a wide range of ongoing art projects in different parts of Southeast and East Asia, the event offered a fresh perspective on the meanings of (making) local-regional-global nexuses which have been both challenged and given new impetus by the current crisis. The Southeast Asian perspectives highlighted in the conference also provided new opportunities to scrutinise the crisis not just in geographical but also in temporal terms, questioning the relationship between the past, present and future state of the arts. The presentations provided inspiring cases to examine the political relevance of artists and the potential and limitations of the emergence of cultural policy entrepreneurs in different Southeast Asian societies.

Although TMPRSS2 is a well-characterized type II transmembrane serine protease (TTSP), the role of other TTSPs on the replication of SARS-CoV-2 remains to be elucidated. Here, we have screened 12 TTSPs using human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2-expressing HEK293T (293T-ACE2) cells and Vero E6 cells and demonstrated that exogenous expression of TMPRSS11D and TMPRSS13 enhanced cellular uptake and subsequent replication of SARS-CoV-2. In addition, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 share the same TTSPs in the viral entry process. Our study demonstrates the impact of host TTSPs on infection of SARS-CoV-2, which may have implications for cell and tissue tropism, for pathogenicity, and potentially for vaccine development.","Kishimoto, Mai; Uemura, Kentaro; Sanaki, Takao; Sato, Akihiko; Hall, William W; Kariwa, Hiroaki; Orba, Yasuko; Sawa, Hirofumi; Sasaki, Michihito",Viruses,,244

446564,Tele-Rehabilitation during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Experience of a Large Lung Transplant Program,2021,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has cost lives and economic hardships globally. Various studies have found a number of different factors, such as hyperinflammation and exhausted/suppressed T cell responses to the etiological SARS coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), being associated with severe COVID-19. However, sieving the causative from associative factors of respiratory dysfunction has remained rudimentary. METHODS: We postulated that the host responses causative of respiratory dysfunction would track most closely with disease progression and resolution and thus be differentiated from other factors that are statistically associated with but not causative of severe COVID-19. To track the temporal dynamics of the host responses involved, we examined the changes in gene expression in whole blood of 6 severe and 4 non-severe COVID-19 patients across 15 different timepoints spanning the nadir of respiratory function. FINDINGS: We found that neutrophil activation but not type I interferon signaling transcripts tracked most closely with disease progression and resolution. Moreover, transcripts encoding for protein phosphorylation, particularly the serine-threonine kinases, many of which have known T cell proliferation and activation functions, were increased after and may thus contribute to the upswing of respiratory function. Notably, these associative genes were targeted by dexamethasone, but not methylprednisolone, which is consistent with efficacy outcomes in clinical trials. INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest neutrophil activation as a critical factor of respiratory dysfunction in COVID-19. Drugs that target this pathway could be potentially repurposed for the treatment of severe COVID-19. FUNDING: This study was sponsored in part by a generous gift from The Hour Glass.

The ~1.93 million curated interactions in BioGRID can be used to build complex networks to facilitate biomedical discoveries, particularly as related to human health and disease. All BioGRID content is curated from primary experimental evidence in the biomedical literature, and includes both focused low-throughput studies and large high-throughput datasets. BioGRID also captures protein post-translational modifications and protein or gene interactions with bioactive small molecules including many known drugs. A built-in network visualization tool combines all annotations and allows users to generate network graphs of protein, genetic and chemical interactions. In addition to general curation across species, BioGRID undertakes themed curation projects in specific aspects of cellular regulation, for example the ubiquitin-proteasome system, as well as specific disease areas, such as for the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 severe acute respiratory syndrome. A recent extension of BioGRID, named the Open Repository of CRISPR Screens (ORCS, orcs.thebiogrid.org), captures single mutant phenotypes and genetic interactions from published high throughput genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9-based genetic screens. BioGRID-ORCS contains datasets for over 1,042 CRISPR screens carried out to date in human, mouse and fly cell lines.

449717,Susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 in patients treated with bDMARDS and tsDMARDs: a population-based study,2020,"Abstract The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has created unprecedent challenges for healthcare systems worldwide. Oncology services have been reorganized to decrease the risk of nosocomial acquisition of SARS-CoV-2, but changes in treatment pathways and follow-up cancer care can result in patients receiving suboptimal or delayed care. Herein, we describe a cross-sectional nested cohort study conducted to evaluate delays in care for patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) in post-treatment follow-up or palliative care during the COVID-19 pandemic in Northeast Brazil and its impact on health outcomes. Information was extracted from medical records and supplemented by telephone interviews. We compared the following health outcomes: self-perception of anxiety or sadness, fear of COVID-19 infection, cancer-related complications during social isolation, self-medication, diagnosis of COVID-19, and death between patients with and without delayed cancer care. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare distributions of continuous variables and the Fisher exact test was used for categorical variables. Thirty-one HNC patients were included in the study, and no case of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 was found. Delayed cancer care due to restriction in health services was reported in 58.1% of cases, and there was no report of telemedicine use during the COVID-19 outbreak. Cancer-related complications during the COVID-19 pandemic were described for most patients (67.7%) and included pain or discomfort, swelling, and dyspnea. Eight (25.8%) patients reported use of prescribed morphine or codeine to manage pain and six (19.4%) patients reported self-medication with over-the-counter (OTC) non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). We found an association between delayed HNC care and the use of self-medication (p = 0.028). This study indicated that patients with delayed HNC care during the COVID-19 outbreak are more likely to use self-medication with NSAIDs for pain management. Better strategies to follow HNC patients in socioeconomically disadvantaged communities need to be discussed and implemented.","MAHL, Claudiane; MELO, Luís Ricardo Santos de; ALMEIDA, Maria Helena Andrade; CARVALHO, Catarina Sampaio; SANTOS, Lois Lene Silva; NUNES, Paula Santos; QUINTANS-JÚNIOR, Lucindo José; ARAÚJO, Adriano Antunes de Souza; SANTOS, Victor Santana; MARTINS-FILHO, Paulo Ricardo",Braz. oral res.

451025,Myoclonus and cerebellar ataxia associated with COVID-19: a case report and systematic review,2021,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to significantly affect the mental health of healthcare workers (HCWs), who stand in the frontline of this crisis. It is, therefore, an immediate priority to monitor rates of mood, sleep and other mental health issues in order to understand mediating factors and inform tailored interventions. The aim of this review is to synthesize and analyze existing evidence on the prevalence of depression, anxiety and insomnia among HCWs during the Covid-19 outbreak. METHODS: A systematic search of literature databases was conducted up to April 17th, 2020. Two reviewers independently assessed full-text articles according to predefined criteria. Risk of bias for each individual study was assessed and data pooled using random-effects meta-analyses to estimate the prevalence of specific mental health problems. The review protocol is registered in PROSPERO and is available online. FINDINGS: Thirteen studies were included in the analysis with a combined total of 33,062 participants. Anxiety was assessed in 12 studies, with a pooled prevalence of 23·2% and depression in 10 studies, with a prevalence rate of 22·8%. A subgroup analysis revealed gender and occupational differences with female HCPs and nurses exhibiting higher rates of affective symptoms compared to male and medical staff respectively. Finally, insomnia prevalence was estimated at 38·9% across 5 studies. INTERPRETATION: Early evidence suggests that a considerable proportion of HCWs experience mood and sleep disturbances during this outbreak, stressing the need to establish ways to mitigate mental health risks and adjust interventions under pandemic conditions.","Pappa, Sofia; Ntella, Vasiliki; Giannakas, Timoleon; Giannakoulis, Vassilis G; Papoutsi, Eleni; Katsaounou, Paraskevi",Brain behav. immun,,244
451477,Presumed pulmonary COVID-19 infection detected incidentally on breast MR,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The global pandemic due to SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in an expansion of telemedicine. Measures of quality and barriers for rapid use by patients and physicians are not well described. OBJECTIVE: To describe results from a quality improvement initiative during a rapid adoptive phase of telemedicine during the pandemic. DESIGN: Patient and physician satisfaction with synchronous audiovisual telemedicine visits was measured during the early adoptive phase (6 April 2020-17 April 2020) within the division of sports medicine in an academic Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PM&R) department. Patients were invited to participate in a quality improvement initiative by completing an online survey at the end of a telemedicine visit. Physicians completed a separate survey. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient measures included visit type, duration of encounter, quality, and satisfaction. Physicians reported on experiences performed telemedicine. RESULTS: Surveys were completed by 119 patients (293 telemedicine encounters, response rate 40.6%) and 14 physiatrists. Telemedicine was utilized primarily for follow-up visits (n = 74, 70.6%), and the most common duration was 15 to 29 minutes. Patients rated their telemedicine visit as ""excellent"" or ""very good"" across measures (91.6%-95.0%) including addressing concerns, communication, developing a treatment plan, convenience, and satisfaction. Value of completing a future telemedicine visit was measured at 84.9%. Most reported estimated travel time saved was in excess of 30 minutes. Rate of no-show was 2.7%. Most physicians (57.1%) had no prior experience with telemedicine visits, and most were comfortable performing these visits after completing 1 to 4 sessions (71%). Nearly all physicians (92.9%) rated their telemedicine experience as very good or excellent. The key barrier identified for telemedicine was technical issues. All physicians reported plans to perform telemedicine visits if reimbursement continues. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, rapid expansion of telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic was well-received by a majority of patients and physicians. This suggests feasibility in rapid expansion of telemedicine for other outpatient sports medicine practices.","Tenforde, Adam S; Iaccarino, Mary A; Borgstrom, Haylee; Hefner, Jaye E; Silver, Julie; Ahmed, Marwa; Babu, Ashwin N; Blauwet, Cheri A; Elson, Lauren; Eng, Christine; Kotler, Dana; Homer, Scott; Makovitch, Steven; McInnis, Kelly C; Vora, Ariana; Borg-Stein, Joanne",PM R,,244

METHODS: Using data identifying all COVID+ surgical patients during the initial pandemic peak in New York City (March 15 to May 15, 2020), we analyzed the rate of postoperative symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in COVID negative (COVID-) patients undergoing surgery in the same operating room within 48 h, thus determining nosocomial symptomatic infection rate attributable to COVID operating room exposure. RESULTS: Five COVID- patients directly followed a COVID+ patient, while 19 patients were exposed to COVID+ operating rooms within 24 h. By 48 h, 21 additional patients were exposed. No exposed patients acquired symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection postoperatively. CONCLUSION: With implementation of infection prevention and control procedures in the operating room under local pandemic conditions, our findings suggest that the risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection, when following a COVID+ patient in the same operating room, is very low.","Axiotakis, Lucas G; Boyett, Deborah M; Youngerman, Brett E; McKhann, Guy M; Lalwani, Anil K",Langenbecks Arch Surg,,244

Existence and boundedness of non-negative solution of the fractional model is proved. Local stability is also discussed based on Matignon’s stability conditions. Numerical results show that the fractional parameter has effect on flattening the curves of the coexistence steady state.

Thus, rapid and sensitive diagnostics is the most important measures to control the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. Homogeneous biosensing based on magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) is one of the most promising approaches for rapid and highly sensitive detection of biomolecules. This paper proposes an approach for rapid and sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 with functionalized MNPs via the measurement of their magnetic response in an ac magnetic field. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach allows the rapid detection of mimic SARS-CoV-2 with a limit of detection of 0.084 nM (5.9 fmole). The proposed approach has great potential for designing a low-cost and point-of-care device for rapid and sensitive diagnostics of SARS-CoV-2.","Zhong, Jing; Roesch, Enja Laureen; Viereck, Thilo; Schilling, Meinhard; Ludwig, Frank",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.03886v1.pdf,244
455224,"Commentary: Statins, COVID-19, and coronary artery disease: killing two birds with one stone",2020,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Corona virus disease-19 first detected in China, December 2019. The government of Ethiopia takes preventive measures but the number of peoples infected with COVID-19 has been increased. Control of the pandemic requires changing of knowledge, attitude and practice of people. Hence, the objective of this study was to assess chronic disease patients' knowledge, attitude and practice towards COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Institution based cross-sectional study was done among 413 chronic disease patients from July 20 to August 5, 2020 in Dessie town hospitals. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was used and significant association declared at p-value of <0.05. RESULTS: From the total participants 34.6%, 81.4% and 40.7% had good knowledge, attitude and practice while 35.1%, 12.1% and 24.7% had moderate knowledge, attitude and practice towards COVID-19 pandemic, respectively. In multinomial logistic regression young age, urban residency, attainment of secondary education and presence of additional co-morbidity were predictors of moderate knowledge whereas urban residency, not attended formal education and presence of additional co-morbidity were predictors of good knowledge about COVID-19. Household family size and presence of additional co-morbidity were factors significantly associated with moderate practice of COVID-19 prevention methods. Furthermore, male sex, household family size, knowledge of COVID-19 and attitude towards COVID-19 were factors significantly associated with good practice of COVID-19 prevention methods. CONCLUSION: Significant number of chronic disease patients had poor knowledge and practice towards COVID-19. Therefore, government, health professionals, Medias, researchers and health institution should do to improve the gaps of chronic diseases patients.","Addis, Sisay Gedamu; Nega, Abebe Dires; Miretu, Debrnesh Goshiye",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,244
455255,Triage tool for suspected COVID-19 patients in the emergency room: AIFELL score,2020,"The outbreak of COVID-19 raises an urgent need for the therapeutics to contain the emerging pandemic. However, no effective treatment has been found for SARS-CoV-2 infection to date. Here, we identified puerarin (PubChem CID: 5281807), quercetin (PubChem CID: 5280343) and kaempferol (PubChem CID: 5280863) as potential compounds with binding activity to ACE2 by using Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform (TCMSP). Molecular docking analysis showed that puerarin and quercetin exhibit good binding affinity to ACE2, which was validated by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay. Furthermore, SPR-based competition assay revealed that puerarin and quercetin could significantly affect the binding of viral S-protein to ACE2 receptor. Notably, quercetin could also bind to the RBD domain of S-protein, suggesting not only a receptor blocking, but also a virus neutralizing effect of quercetin on SARS-CoV-2. The results from network pharmacology and bioinformatics analysis support a view that quercetin is involved in host immunomodulation, which further renders it a promising candidate against COVID-19. Moreover, given that puerarin is already an existing drug, results from this study not only provide insight into its action mechanism, but also propose a prompt application of it on COVID-19 patients for assessing its clinical feasibility.","Pan, Boyu; Fang, Senbiao; Zhang, Ju; Pan, Ya; Liu, Han; Wang, Yun; Li, Min; Liu, Liren",Comput Struct Biotechnol J,,244

As a result, the optimal policy with commitment tends to front-load UI, unlike the optimal discretionary policy. In response to shocks intended to mimic those that induced the COVID-19 recession, we find that a large and transitory increase in UI is optimal;and that a policy rule contingent on the change in unemployment, rather than its level, is a good approximation to the optimal policy.","Mitman, Kurt Rabinovich Stanislav",Journal of Public Economics,,244

465621,Acute chest syndrome and COVID-19 in sickle cell disease pediatric patients,2020,"Aim: to present a mathematical model of the development of COVID-19 in Moscow along with the analysis of some scenarios of epidemic control and possible epidemic consequences. Materials and Methods. The modeling of the epidemics was based on the extended SEIR model proposed lately in the group of Prof. R. Neher and realized as a freely available software program. The authors based the choice of the parameters of modeling on published data on the epidemiological properties of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and open access data on the registered cases of COVID-19 in Moscow for 8-27 March 2020. Results. Five potential scenarios of the development of COVID-19 epidemics are studied. The scenarios are differed by the levels of the control measures: Null Scenario corresponded to the lack of protective measures, Scenario A - mild measures of the epidemic control (closing of schools and universities, recommendations for senior citizens to stay inside), Scenario B - medium level of control (closing of all public places, recommendation for the citizens to stay inside), Scenarios C and D - complete lockdown (from the beginning of May 2020 within Scenario C and from the beginning of April 2020 within Scenario D). It was shown that within the Null Scenario, the lethality from the novel coronavirus in Moscow will exceed 100 thousand people, and the number of critically ill patients on the peak of the epidemics will exceed the capacities of the system of healthcare. Scenarios A and B did not provide for a radical decrease in the fatality rate, and the number of critically ill patients at the peak of epidemics will still exceed the capacities of the system of healthcare. Besides, within Scenario B, the epidemics will last for more than a year. Scenarios C and D will allow for the control of epidemics and a significant decrease in the rate of lethality (by 30 and 400 times, respectively). At the same time, these two scenarios prevent the population from developing herd immunity, which would result in the population susceptibility to repeated epidemics outbreaks. Conclusion. The scenarios intended for the slow development of herd immunity in the conditions of epidemic control would not bring sufficient results: the lethality would remain unacceptably high, the capacities of the system of healthcare would be overloaded, and the time of limiting measures would be unacceptably long. Such measures as complete lockdown would stop the present epidemics. The earlier they are introduced, the more efficient will be the results. To prevent further repeated outbreaks of the epidemics, it is necessary to establish a system of available, quick, and efficient testing in combination with point isolation of the infected patients and their contacts.","Tamm, M.

Methods: The online electronic survey form was prepared on the Google app. Children/parents were asked to indicate the total duration of digital device use before and during COVID era. The symptoms of DES, its severity and frequency were recorded & measured with the Computer Vision Syndrome Questionnaire. Results: Two hundred and sixty one parents responded to the questionnaire, of these 217 were complete. Mean age of children was 13 ± 2.45 years. Mean duration of digital device used during COVID era was 3.9 ± 1.9 h which is more than pre COVID era (1.9 ± 1.1 h, P = <0.0001). 36.9% (n = 80) were using digital devices >5 h in COVID era as compared to 1.8% (n = 4) before COVID era. The most common digital device used were smartphones (n = 134, 61.7%). One hundred and eight children (49.8%) were attending online classes for >2 h per day. Prevalence of DES in our cohort is 50.23% (109/217). Of these 26.3% were mild, 12.9% moderate and 11.1% of severe grade. Most common symptoms were itching and headache (n = 117, 53.9%). Multivariate analysis revealed age >14 years (P = 0.04), male gender (P = 0.0004), smartphone use (P = 0.003), use of device >5 h (P = 0.0007) and mobile games >1 h/day (P = 0.0001) as independent risk factors for DES in children. Conclusion: There is an increased prevalence of DES among children in COVID era. Parents should be considerate about duration, type and distance of digital device use to avoid DES symptoms in children.","Mohan, Amit; Sen, Pradhnya; Shah, Chintan; Jain, Elesh; Jain, Swapnil",Indian J Ophthalmol,,244

In the field of healthcare, deep learning has been implemented in many applications, e.g., diabetic retinopathy detection, lung nodule classification, fetal localization, and thyroid diagnosis. Numerous sources of medical images (e.g., X-ray, CT, and MRI) make deep learning a great technique to combat the COVID-19 outbreak. Motivated by this fact, a large number of research works have been proposed and developed for the initial months of 2020. In this paper, we first focus on summarizing the state-of-the-art research works related to deep learning applications for COVID-19 medical image processing. Then, we provide an overview of deep learning and its applications to healthcare found in the last decade. Next, three use cases in China, Korea, and Canada are also presented to show deep learning applications for COVID-19 medical image processing. Finally, we discuss several challenges and issues related to deep learning implementations for COVID-19 medical image processing, which are expected to drive further studies in controlling the outbreak and controlling the crisis, which results in smart healthy cities.","Bhattacharya, Sweta; Reddy Maddikunta, Praveen Kumar; Pham, Quoc-Viet; Gadekallu, Thippa Reddy; Krishnan S, Siva Rama; Chowdhary, Chiranji Lal; Alazab, Mamoun; Piran, Md Jalil",Sustain Cities Soc,,244

Nowadays, double adenomas remain a difficult diagnostic and therapeutic task. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 64-year-old woman was referred to an endocrine surgeon to evaluate a persistently elevating level of calcium. In the biochemical analysis the serum level of total calcium was increased - 2.79 mmol/l, ionized calcium - 1.64 mmol/l, parathyroid hormone - 191.4 pg/mL. Ultrasound and MSCT scan of the neck showed an increase of the parathyroid glands under the lower poles of both lobes of the thyroid gland. No functionally active parathyroid glands were found on scintigraphy. The patient underwent bilateral neck exploration with identiï¬cation of all four parathyroid glands and a double parathyroid adenomectomy. According to a histological study, the removed parathyroid glands are represented by adenomas from the dark main cells. Remission of primary hyperparathyroidism was achieved. DISCUSSION: This clinical report confirms the literature on a decrease in the sensitivity of imaging methods in the diagnosis of double adenomas. A decrease in the effectiveness of intraoperative monitoring of parathyroid hormone with double adenomas was confirmed. In this patient, a double parathyroid adenomectomy was sufficient to achieve remission of hyperparathyroidism. CONCLUSION: With double adenomas, a comprehensive assessment of all imaging methods is required. A positive test during intraoperative monitoring of IPTG does not exclude a double adenoma in a patient. It is necessary to perform a bilateral neck exploration with identiï¬cation of all parathyroid glands.","Ilyicheva, Elena A; Bersenev, Gleb A",,,244

477549,Late Breaking Abstract - Identifying and phenotyping COVID-19 patients using machine learning on chest x-rays,2020,"Therapeutic options for coronaviruses remain limited. To address this unmet medical need, we screened 5406 compounds, including United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs and bioactives, for activity against a South Korean Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) clinical isolate. Among 221 identified hits, 54 had therapeutic indexes (TI) greater than 6, representing effective drugs. The time-of-addition studies with selected drugs demonstrated eight and four FDA-approved drugs which acted on the early and late stages of the viral life cycle, respectively. Confirmed hits included several cardiotonic agents (TI > 100), atovaquone, an anti-malarial (TI > 34), and ciclesonide, an inhalable corticosteroid (TI > 6). Furthermore, utilizing the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), we tested combinations of remdesivir with selected drugs in Vero-E6 and Calu-3 cells, in lung organoids, and identified ciclesonide, nelfinavir, and camostat to be at least additive in vitro. Our results identify potential therapeutic options for MERS-CoV infections, and provide a basis to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and other coronavirus-related illnesses.","Ko, Meehyun; Chang, So Young; Byun, Soo Young; Ianevski, Aleksandr; Choi, Inhee; d039, Pham Hung; d039, Alexandry; Orengiani, Anne-Laure; Ravlo, Erlend; Wang, Wei; Bjørås, Magnar; Kainov, Denis E; Shum, David; Min, Ji-Young; Windisch, Marc P",Viruses,,244

Hospitals have had to make drastic changes to normal workflows and practices to handle the current pandemic. Laboratories face unique challenges in the management of the investigation of COVID-19. Not only must we consider the safe collection and delivery of samples, but we must also observe the latest guidelines in testing for the virus. We have introduced several new measures in our laboratory to accommodate the collection and testing of samples for COVID-19 from both within the hospital and external screening sites. These changes encompass the pre-analytical (sample collection, packaging, and delivery), analytical (evaluation, handling and preparation of samples) and post-analytical (result reporting within the hospital and to external bodies) aspects of both routine (biochemistry, haematology, transfusion and urine, stool and body fluid testing) and COVID-19 testing, to ensure the safe and efficient testing of any patient samples. In addition, more practical matters, such as laboratory staffing and continuing staff education, have also been changed to ensure the safety and well-being of laboratory staff. With the implementation of new rules and regulations, we seek to safeguard the health of all healthcare workers while streamlining the workflow for the large amount of testing required during this period. As the pandemic continues, new tests (e.g. COVID-19 serology and IL6 testing for prognosis or monitoring) are being requested, requiring even more changes and assay evaluation before implementation. All laboratories must be ready to adapt to these new challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lau, Chin Shern; Kamaludin, Noor Ashraf; Aw, Tar Choon",Proc. Singapore Healthcare,,244

The World Health Organization declared the pandemic diffusion of COVID-19, and restrictive measures to limit contagion have been taken in several countries. The virus has a predominantly respiratory transmission through aerosol and droplets. The importance of infection control is therefore crucial in limiting the effects of virus diffusion. We aim to discuss the risks related to dental practice and current recommendations for dental practitioners. A literature search was performed to retrieve articles on the management of COVID-19 diffusion in dental practice. The documented clinical experience, the measures of professional prevention, and the actual Italian situation were reported and described. Four articles were retrieved from the literature search. Among the eligible articles, 3 reported measures to contrast COVID-19 diffusion. The infection management protocols suggested were reviewed. Finally, recommendations based on the Italian experience in terms of patient triage, patients' entrance into the practice, dental treatment, and after-treatment management are reported and discussed. COVID-19 is a major emergency worldwide, which should not be underestimated.

A mechanistic understanding of the impact of bats' virus hosting capacities, including uniquely constitutive immune pathways, on cellular-scale viral dynamics is needed to elucidate zoonotic emergence. We carried out virus infectivity assays on bat cell lines expressing induced and constitutive immune phenotypes, then developed a theoretical model of our in vitro system, which we fit to empirical data. Best fit models recapitulated expected immune phenotypes for representative cell lines, supporting robust antiviral defenses in bat cells that correlated with higher estimates for within-host viral propagation rates. In general, heightened immune responses limit pathogen-induced cellular morbidity, which can facilitate the establishment of rapidly-propagating persistent infections within-host. Rapidly-transmitting viruses that have evolved with bat immune systems will likely cause enhanced virulence following emergence into secondary hosts with immune systems that diverge from those unique to bats.","Brook, Cara E; Boots, Mike; Chandran, Kartik; Dobson, Andrew P; Drosten, Christian; Graham, Andrea L; Grenfell, Bryan T; Müller, Marcel A; Ng, Melinda; Wang, Lin-Fa; van Leeuwen, Anieke",eLife (Cambridge),,244

Evidence related to the use of standardised measures in an ever-expanding online environment, for the purpose of identifying need, is limited. METHODS: This study explores the reliability of using a standardised measure to detect clinical need in an online therapeutic environment, and the measures assessed are as follows: Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), Young Person's CORE (YP-CORE) and the Short Warwick and Edinburgh Wellbeing Scale (SWEMWBS). A deep-dive approach is used to inform practitioner assessment of young people, followed by a Weighted Cohen's Kappa (&#922;w) to measure the interrater reliability between this and the individuals' self-rated outcome. Composite case studies represent the complexities of presentation among the sample population. RESULTS: The interrater reliability between self-rated and practitioner rated assessment varied between &#922;w = .222 and &#922;w = 0.446 depending on the measure. High levels of need and low levels of well-being were found among the sample (YP-CORE Avg. = 26.9, SDQ Avg. = 19.56, SWEMWBS Avg. = 18.1). CONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrate a fair to moderate reliability when assessing concordance between service users and practitioners, which suggests standardised measures are a reliable indicator of need. Higher levels of need were present than those seen previously in general or face-to-face clinical populations, which suggests using such measures in an online therapeutic environment influences the way in which assessments are responded to.","Mindel, Charlotte; Oppong, Crystal; Rothwell, Emily; Sefi, Aaron; Jacob, Jenna",Child and adolescent mental health,,244

486295,"Letter by Baracchini and Pieroni Regarding Article, ""Protected Code Stroke: Hyperacute Stroke Management During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic""",2020,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a global pandemic in 2020. Testing is crucial for mitigating public health and economic effects. Serology is considered key to population-level surveillance and potentially individual-level risk assessment. However, immunoassay performance has not been compared on large, identical sample sets. We aimed to investigate the performance of four high-throughput commercial SARS-CoV-2 antibody immunoassays and a novel 384-well ELISA. METHODS: We did a head-to-head assessment of SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay (Abbott, Chicago, IL, USA), LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG assay (DiaSorin, Saluggia, Italy), Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), SARS-CoV-2 Total assay (Siemens, Munich, Germany), and a novel 384-well ELISA (the Oxford immunoassay). We derived sensitivity and specificity from 976 pre-pandemic blood samples (collected between Sept 4, 2014, and Oct 4, 2016) and 536 blood samples from patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, collected at least 20 days post symptom onset (collected between Feb 1, 2020, and May 31, 2020). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to assess assay thresholds. FINDINGS: At the manufacturers' thresholds, for the Abbott assay sensitivity was 92·7% (95% CI 90·2-94·8) and specificity was 99·9% (99·4-100%); for the DiaSorin assay sensitivity was 96·2% (94·2-97·7) and specificity was 98·9% (98·0-99·4); for the Oxford immunoassay sensitivity was 99·1% (97·8-99·7) and specificity was 99·0% (98·1-99·5); for the Roche assay sensitivity was 97·2% (95·4-98·4) and specificity was 99·8% (99·3-100); and for the Siemens assay sensitivity was 98·1% (96·6-99·1) and specificity was 99·9% (99·4-100%). All assays achieved a sensitivity of at least 98% with thresholds optimised to achieve a specificity of at least 98% on samples taken 30 days or more post symptom onset. INTERPRETATION: Four commercial, widely available assays and a scalable 384-well ELISA can be used for SARS-CoV-2 serological testing to achieve sensitivity and specificity of at least 98%. The Siemens assay and Oxford immunoassay achieved these metrics without further optimisation.

Proper COVID-19 management requires high skills in airway control and the need to perform aerosol-generating procedures such as bronchoscopy, which can increase the possibility of virus spreading among healthcare professionals. In an epidemiologically delicate moment, the multidisciplinary decision on ""WHEN, HOW and WHY"" to perform bronchoscopies minimizing the risk of COVID-19 transmission, represented a great challenge for all specialists engaged in bronchoscopic procedures. In this work authors want to share all technical aspects of 87 videobronchoscopies performed in confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients, from 3rd to 6th January 2020, describing the reason, the organizational and operational model and patients characteristics. Was also evaluated the impact of high-risk procedures such as bronchoscopy on the personnel involved. The disclosure of all technical details, represents, in the opinion of the authors, an important contribution, capable of providing support to all physicians engaged in bronchoscopy procedures in confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients.","Guarino, Carmine; Cesaro, Cristiano; Fiorentino, Giuseppe; Rossi, Francesco; Polverino, Benedetto Maria; Fragranza, Fiorentino; Monastra, Luca; Murino, Patrizia; Zamparelli, Enzo; La Cerra, Giuseppe",Monaldi arch. chest dis,,244

The specific features of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in immunosuppressed patients are largely unknown and therapeutic experience is lacking. Seven transplanted patients (two liver, three kidneys, one double lung, one heart) admitted to the Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich because of COVID-19 and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were included. The clinical course and the clinical findings were extracted from the medical record. The two liver transplant patients and the heart transplant patient had an uncomplicated course and were discharged after 14, 18 and 12 days, respectively. Two kidney transplant recipients were intubated within 48 hours. One kidney and the lung transplant recipients were required to intubate after ten and 15 days, respectively. Immunosuppression was adapted in five patients, but continued in all patients. Compared to non-transplanted patients at the ICU (n=19) the inflammatory response was attenuated in transplanted patients, which was proven by decreased IL-6 blood values. This analysis might provide evidence that continuous immunosuppression is safe and probably beneficial since there was no hyperinflammation evident. Although transplanted patients might be more susceptible to an infection with SARS-CoV-2, their clinical course seems to be similar to immunocompetent patients.","Bösch, Florian; Börner, Nikolaus; Kemmner, Stephan; Lampert, Christopher; Jacob, Sven; Koliogiannis, Dionysios; Stangl, Manfred; Michel, Sebastian; Kneidinger, Nikolaus; Schneider, Christian; Fischereder, Michael; Irlbeck, Michael; Denk, Gerald; Werner, Jens; Angele, Martin K; Guba, Markus O",Clin Transplant,,244

Although significant effort has been invested in identifying antibodies that block infection, the ability of antibodies to target infected cells through Fc interactions may be vital to eliminate the virus. To explore the role of Fc activity in SARS-CoV-2 immunity, the functional potential of a cross-SARS-reactive antibody, CR3022, was assessed. CR3022 was able to broadly drive antibody effector functions, providing critical immune clearance at entry and upon egress. Using selectively engineered Fc variants, no protection was observed after administration of WT IgG1 in mice or hamsters. Conversely, the functionally enhanced Fc variant resulted in increased pathology in both the mouse and hamster models, causing weight loss in mice and enhanced viral replication and weight loss in the more susceptible hamster model, highlighting the pathological functions of Fc-enhancing mutations. These data point to the critical need for strategic Fc engineering for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Atyeo, Caroline; Slein, Matthew D; Fischinger, Stephanie; Burke, John; Schäfer, Alexandra; Leist, Sarah R; Kuzmina, Natalia A; Mire, Chad; Honko, Anna; Johnson, Rebecca; Storm, Nadia; Bernett, Matthew; Tong, Pei; Zuo, Teng; Lin, Junrui; Zuiani, Adam; Linde, Caitlyn; Suscovich, Todd; Wesemann, Duane R; Griffiths, Anthony; Desjarlais, John R; Juelg, Boris D; Goudsmit, Jaap; Bukreyev, Alexander; Baric, Ralph; Alter, Galit",JCI insight,,244

However, due to their ecological design based on large spatial units, they neglect the strong localised air-pollution patterns, and potentially lead to inadequate confounding adjustment. We investigated the effect of long-term exposure to NO2 and PM2.5 on COVID-19 mortality in England using high geographical resolution. In this nationwide cross-sectional study in England, we included 38,573 COVID-19 deaths up to June 30, 2020 at the Lower Layer Super Output Area level (n = 32,844 small areas). We retrieved averaged NO2 and PM2.5 concentration during 2014-2018 from the Pollution Climate Mapping. We used Bayesian hierarchical models to quantify the effect of air-pollution while adjusting for a series of confounding and spatial autocorrelation. We find a 0.5% (95% credible interval: -0.2%, 1.2%) and 1.4% (95% CrI: -2.1%, 5.1%) increase in COVID-19 mortality risk for every 1 µg/m3 increase in NO2 and PM2.5 respectively, after adjusting for confounding and spatial autocorrelation. This corresponds to a posterior probability of a positive effect equal to 0.93 and 0.78 respectively. The spatial relative risk at LSOA level revealed strong patterns, similar for the different pollutants. This potentially captures the spread of the disease during the first wave of the epidemic. Our study provides some evidence of an effect of long-term NO2 exposure on COVID-19 mortality, while the effect of PM2.5 remains more uncertain.","Konstantinoudis, Garyfallos; Padellini, Tullia; Bennett, James; Davies, Bethan; Ezzati, Majid; Blangiardo, Marta",Environ Int,,244

Systematic review,2020,"BACKGROUND: The cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner), is a damaging insect pest threatening agricultural crops worldwide due to its resistance to insecticides. Metabolic resistance to pyrethroid insecticides is conferred by the chimeric P450 enzyme CYP337B3, produced by unequal crossing-over between CYP337B1 and CYP337B2. CYP337B3 is 99.7% similar to CYP337B1 except for the 177 N-terminal amino acids containing the substrate recognition site 1 from CYP337B2. Here, we studied the structure-function relationship of CYP337B3 and CYP337B1 to determine the amino acids that enable CYP337B3 to efficiently hydroxylate the 4'-carbon position of fenvalerate, while neither CYP337B1 nor CYP337B2 can do so. RESULTS: Site-directed mutagenesis showed the L114F substitution in CYP337B3 reduced its 4'-hydroxylation activity by 89%, but the reciprocal F114L substitution in CYP337B1 increased its 4'-hydroxylation activity to only 49% of the level of CYP337B3. Docking models showed that amino acid 114 seems to have different functions in CYP337B1 and CYP337B3. Antibodies detected 2 to 3-fold more CYP337B1 than CYP337B3 in larval cuticle, which along with a 49% 4'-hydroxylation activity increase due to a F114L substitution in vivo might be expected to provide as much protection of the larva against exposure to fenvalerate as CYP337B3. However, CYP337B3 is present at much higher frequencies than CYP337B1-CYP337B2 in most populations, including those recently invading South America. CONCLUSION: The metabolic resistance to pyrethroids in H. armigera has evolved by saltational evolution; i.e. by a single mutation, an unequal crossing-over, producing a larger selective advantage than could be attained gradually by stepwise improvement of the parental enzyme.

In COVID-19 patients, the number of platelets (PLTs) and dynamic changes of PLT-related parameters are currently a concern. The present paper discusses the potential link between PLT parameters and COVID-19. Several studies have identified a link between severe COVID-19 patients and specific coagulation index, in particular, high D-dimer level, prolonged prothrombin time, and low PLT count. These alterations reflect the hypercoagulable state present in severe COVID-19 patients, which could promote microthrombosis in the lungs, as well as in other organs. Further information and more advanced hematological parameters related to PLTs are needed to better estimate this link, also considering COVID-19 patients at different disease stages and stratified in different cohorts based on preexisting co-morbidity, age, and gender. Increasing the understanding of PLT functions in COVID-19 will undoubtedly improve our knowledge on disease pathogenesis, clinical management, and therapeutic options, but could also lead to the development of more precise therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 patients.","Salamanna, Francesca; Maglio, Melania; Landini, Maria Paola; Fini, Milena",Platelets,,244

494473,Graft endoclamping with brachio-femoral wire conduit for elephant trunk retrieval in open thoraco-abdominal aortic repair,2020,"The 5' cap methylation of viral RNA plays important roles in RNA stability, efficient translation, and immune evasion. Thus, RNA cap methylation is an attractive target for antiviral discovery and development of new live attenuated vaccines. For coronaviruses, RNA cap structure is first methylated at the guanine-N-7 (G-N-7) position by nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14), which facilitates and precedes the subsequent ribose 2'-O methylation by the nsp16-nsp10 complex. Using porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), an Alphacoronavirus, as a model, we showed that G-N-7 methyltransferase (G-N-7 MTase) of PEDV nsp14 methylated RNA substrates in a sequence-unspecific manner. PEDV nsp14 can efficiently methylate RNA substrates with various lengths in both neutral and alkaline pH environments and can methylate cap analogs (GpppA and GpppG) and single-nucleotide GTP but not ATP, CTP, or UTP. Mutations to the S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) binding motif in the nsp14 abolished the G-N-7 MTase activity and were lethal to PEDV. However, recombinant rPEDV-D350A with a single mutation (D350A) in nsp14, which retained 29.0% of G-N-7 MTase activity, was viable. Recombinant rPEDV-D350A formed a significantly smaller plaque and had significant defects in viral protein synthesis and viral replication in Vero CCL-81 cells and intestinal porcine epithelial cells (IPEC-DQ). Notably, rPEDV-D350A induced significantly higher expression of both type I and III interferons in IPEC-DQ cells than the parental rPEDV. Collectively, our results demonstrate that G-N-7 MTase activity of PEDV modulates viral replication, gene expression, and innate immune responses.IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses (CoVs) include a wide range of important human and animal pathogens. Examples of human CoVs include severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and the most recently emerged SARS-CoV-2. Examples of pig CoVs include porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), and swine enteric alphacoronavirus (SeACoV). There are no vaccines or antiviral drugs for most of these viruses. All known CoVs encode a bifunctional nsp14 protein which possesses ExoN and guanine-N-7 methyltransferase (G-N-7 MTase) activities, responsible for replication fidelity and RNA cap G-N-7 methylation, respectively. Here, we biochemically characterized G-N-7 MTase of PEDV nsp14 and found that G-N-7 MTase-deficient PEDV was defective in replication and induced greater responses of type I and III interferons. These findings highlight that CoV G-N-7 MTase may be a novel target for rational design of live attenuated vaccines and antiviral drugs.","Lu, Yunjian; Cai, Hui; Lu, Mijia; Ma, Yuanmei; Li, Anzhong; Gao, Youling; Zhou, Jiyong; Gu, Howard; Li, Jianrong; Gu, Jinyan",J. virol,,244

498032,Use of convalescent plasma in COVID-19 patients with immunosuppression,2021,"Mammalian cells detect microbial molecules known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) as indicators of potential infection. Upon PAMP detection, diverse defensive responses are induced by the host, including those that promote inflammation and cell-intrinsic antimicrobial activities. Host-encoded molecules released from dying or damaged cells, known as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), also induce defensive responses. Both DAMPs and PAMPs are recognized for their inflammatory potential, but only the latter are well established to stimulate cell-intrinsic host defense. Here, we report a class of DAMPs that engender an antiviral state in human epithelial cells. These DAMPs include oxPAPC (oxidized 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine), PGPC (1-palmitoyl-2-glutaryl phosphatidylcholine), and POVPC [1-palmitoyl-2-(5-oxovaleroyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine], oxidized lipids that are naturally released from dead or dying cells. Exposing cells to these DAMPs prior to vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection limits viral replication. Mechanistically, these DAMPs prevent viral entry, thereby limiting the percentage of cells that are productively infected and consequently restricting viral load. We found that the antiviral actions of oxidized lipids are distinct from those mediated by the PAMP Poly I:C, in that the former induces a more rapid antiviral response without the induction of the interferon response. These data support a model whereby interferon-independent defensive activities can be induced by DAMPs, which may limit viral replication before PAMP-mediated interferon responses are induced. This antiviral activity may impact viruses that disrupt interferon responses in the oxygenated environment of the lung, such as influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2.IMPORTANCE In this work, we explored how a class of oxidized lipids, spontaneously created during tissue damage and unprogrammed cell lysis, block the earliest events in RNA virus infection in the human epithelium. This gives us novel insight into the ways that we view infection models, unveiling a built-in mechanism to slow viral growth that neither engages the interferon response nor is subject to known viral antagonism. These oxidized phospholipids act prior to infection, allowing time for other, better-known innate immune mechanisms to take effect. This discovery broadens our understanding of host defenses, introducing a soluble factor that alters the cellular environment to protect from RNA virus infection.","Ernandes, Michael J; Kagan, Jonathan C",mBio (Online),,244

499273,Heart Transplantation Single Center Experience of 63 Heart Transplantation Procedures Performed during the COVID 19 Pandemic,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the worth of a single-donor program for preterm infants through the recipient profile and the impact on donor exposure, red blood cell (RBC) pack waste, storage duration, and transfusion performance. STUDY DESIGN: Patients and transfusion characteristics were collected for 3 years (2015-2017) in preterm infants according to single-donor program prescription in a unit not practicing placental transfusion or erythropoietin supplementation. RESULTS: Among 1048 eligible preterm infants, 161 met the inclusion criteria, and 51 received single-donor packs. Our single-donor program induced a donor number reduction (34% less than the transfusion number) and an extension of storage duration (median: 9 versus 7 days, p < 0.0001) without altering the transfusion performance. However, 41% of small packs were not used. CONCLUSION: A single-donor program partially reduced donor exposure but led to drastic RBC pack waste. Optimization of transfusion alternatives may increase this phenomenon, calling into question the rationale of this practice.","Gouache, Elodie; Py, Jean-Yves; Hérault, Béatrice; Saliba, Elie; Favrais, Geraldine",J. perinatol,,244

Our community has always thrived on discussing cases and sharing ideas with each other in auditoriums and during coffee breaks. Networking opportunities and lifelong collaborations have been forged at various conference dinners. All in-person meetings have either been cancelled or changed to a virtual format over this past year. Unmuting oneself and transitioning into breakout rooms have become the most important skills to have when participating in a virtual meeting.There are many positives to take away from this experience. Despite the mental and physical toll of this pandemic, our determination and motivation to better serve our patients have never been stronger. The COVID-19 pandemic has catalysed the progression of digital medical education. We wish to share some examples of what has occurred in Obstetric Medicine.","Chen, Kenneth K.; Banerjee, Anita",Obstetric Medicine,,244
499812,Point-of-Care Ultrasound Findings and Clinical Outcomes in Patients with COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: This study seeks to explore the use of humor during the period of isolation caused by lockdown measures imposed in Italy as a result of the Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. SUBJECTS AND METHOD: The study is based on a non-clinical sample. The ad hoc questionnaire measures people's readiness to search for, publish and distribute humorous material during lockdown. It investigates the intentions behind sending content via social media (WhatsApp or similar) and the emotions experienced on receiving such content. RESULTS: The responses have been analyzed quantitatively, and using Excel's IF function they have been analyzed qualitatively. In the present sample of 106 Italian respondents, searching for content was less common than publishing it (yes 44.34%, no 54.72%). Positive emotions were more frequently the motivation (total 61.32%). A high percentage sent amusing content via social media or SMS (79%). Responses demonstrating a desire to lessen the situation's negative impact or a desire for cohesion were common. Receiving material was similarly associated with positive emotions and a sense of being close to others. CONCLUSIONS: humorous material appears to have served as a means of transmitting positive emotions, distancing oneself from negative events and finding cohesion.","Amici, Patrizia",Psychiatr Danub,,244

502271,Same Day Discharge for CIED Procedures – Is it safe?,2020,"OBJECTIVES: A retrospective study was conducted to identify the prevalence of COVID-19 through serology and RT-PCR in children, adolescents and adults. A database of the COVID-19 Tracking Program in school children was used. METHODS: The data comprised sociodemographic and clinical variables, results of serological tests (IgM and IgG), and real-time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results of IgM-positive individuals. The statistical analysis was performed with a 5% significance level. RESULTS: Among 423 children, 107 (25.3%) exhibited seroprevalence with IgG, IgM or IgG/IgM; among 854 adolescents, 250 (29.2%) had positive serology; and among 282 adults, 59 (20.9%) were positive. The frequency of positivity on RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was 3.5%, 3.6% and 6.0% in children, adolescents and adults, respectively. Children had a lower incidence of symptoms than adolescents (p = 0.001) and adults (p = 0.003); the most frequent were fever, ageusia, anosmia, headache, dry cough, sore throat, muscle pain, runny nose, dyspnoea, and diarrhoea. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence rate for all groups was 26.7% in serology and 4.04% in RT-PCR. Children had lower rates of IgM and fewer symptoms compared with adolescents and adults. The data suggest the potential for transmissibility in all age groups.","Cavalcante Pinto Júnior, Valdester; Moura, Luiz Francisco Wemmenson Gonçalves; Cavalcante, Rodrigo Cardoso; Lima, José Rubens Costa; Bezerra, Arnaldo Solheiro; de Sousa Dantas, Daylana Régia; Amaral, Cícero Matheus Lima; Lima, Daniel Freire; Júnior, Antonio Brazil Viana; Florindo Guedes, Maria Izabel",Int J Infect Dis,,244
502556,Convalescent plasma therapy and mortality among US veterans hospitalized with non-severe COVID-19: An observational analysis emulating a target trial,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Multiple RCTs of interleukin-6 (IL-6) inhibitors in COVID-19 have been published, with conflicting conclusions. We performed a meta-analysis to assess the impact of IL-6 inhibition on mortality from COVID-19, utilising meta-regression to explore differences in study results. METHODS: Systematic database searches were performed to identify RCTs comparing IL-6 inhibitors (tocilizumab and sarilumab) to placebo or standard of care in adults with COVID-19. Meta-analysis was used to estimate the relative risk of mortality at 28 days between arms, expressed as a risk ratio. Within-study mortality rates were compared, and meta-regression was used to investigate treatment effect modification. RESULTS: Data from nine RCTs were included. The combined mortality rate across studies was 19% (95% CI: 18, 20%), ranging from 2% to 31%. The overall risk ratio for 28-day mortality was 0.90 (95% CI: 0.81, 0.99), in favour of benefit for IL-6 inhibition over placebo or standard of care, with low treatment effect heterogeneity: I2 0% (95% CI: 0, 53%). Meta-regression showed no evidence of treatment effect modification by patient characteristics. Trial-specific mortality rates were explained by known patient-level predictors of COVID-19 outcome (male sex, CRP, hypertension), and country-level COVID-19 incidence. CONCLUSIONS: IL-6 inhibition is associated with clinically meaningful improvements in outcomes for patients admitted with COVID-19. Long-term benefits of IL-6 inhibition, its effectiveness across healthcare systems, and implications for differing standards of care are currently unknown.","Tharmarajah, Emmanuel; Buazon, April; Patel, Vishit; Hannah, Jennifer R; Adas, Maryam; Allen, Victoria B; Bechman, Katie; Clarke, Benjamin D; Nagra, Deepak; Norton, Sam; Russell, Mark D; Rutherford, Andrew I; Yates, Mark; Galloway, James B",J Infect,,244
503186,Nebulized in-line endotracheal dornase alfa and albuterol administered to mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients: A case series,2020,"The pandemic of COVID-19 has presented new challenges to hospital personnel providing care for infected patients with diabetes who represent more than 20% of critically ill patients in intensive care units. Appropriate glycemic management contributes to a reduction in adverse clinical outcomes in acute illness but also requires intensive patient interactions for bedside glucose monitoring, intravenous and subcutaneous insulin administration, as well as rapid intervention for hypoglycemia events. These tasks are required at a time when minimizing patient interactions is recommended as a way of avoiding prolonged exposure to COVID-19 by health care personnel who often practice in settings with limited supplies of personal protective equipment. The purpose of this manuscript is to provide guidance for clinicians for reconciling recommended standards of care for infected hospitalized patients with diabetes while also addressing the daily realities of an overwhelmed health care system in many areas of the country. The use of modified protocols for insulin administration, bedside glucose monitoring, and medications such as glucocorticoids and hydroxychloroquine that may affect glycemic control are discussed. Continuous glucose monitoring systems have been proposed as an option for reducing time spent with patients, but there are important issues that need to be addressed if these are used in hospitalized patients. On-site and remote glucose management teams have potential to provide guidance in areas where there are shortages of personnel who have expertise in inpatient glycemic management.","Korytkowski, Mary; Antinori-Lent, Kellie; Drincic, Andjela; Hirsch, Irl B; McDonnell, Marie E; Rushakoff, Robert; Muniyappa, Ranganath",J. clin. endocrinol. metab,,244

504253,Case Report: Epiglottitis in the setting of COVID-19,2021,"The Covid-19 pandemic that entered our lives suddenly in 2020 compelled higher education systems throughout the world to transfer to online learning, including online evaluation. A severe problem of online evaluation is that it enables various technological possibilities that facilitate students' unethical behaviors. The research aimed to investigate these behaviors, as well as the reasons for their appearance, as practiced in exams held for the first time during the Covid-19 pandemic, and to elicit students' and lecturers' perceptions of students' academic dishonesty (AD) during this period. The sample included 81 students and 50 lecturers from several Israeli colleges and universities. The findings expand extant knowledge on academic dishonesty, identifying significant differences between the perceptions of students and lecturers concerning attitudes towards online exams and the reasons for dishonest behaviors. The findings among the students also indicate that younger students and Arab students tended to cheat more in online exams. Moreover, the findings indicated a lack of mutual trust between students and lecturers with regard to academic dishonesty, a deep distrust that will probably continue even after the Covid-19 crisis. This last finding should be a cause of concern for higher education policy-makers, affecting future policies for improving lecturer-student relations, especially during crises. Recommendations are proposed for addressing academic dishonesty in exams in general and during the pandemic in particular.","Amzalag, Meital; Shapira, Noa; Dolev, Niva",J Acad Ethics,,244

505071,Investigating Factors Affecting Intention to Use Government Websites for COVID-19-Related Information: An Empirical Study,2020,"PURPOSE: Vitamin D deficiency has been reported as a key factor in the development of infectious diseases such as respiratory tract infections and inflammatory processes like acute respiratory distress syndrome. However, the impact of vitamin D on the severity and outcome of COVID-19 is still not fully known. Herein, we aimed to evaluate the prognostic role of serum vitamin D concentration on the extent of lung involvement and final outcome in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Seventy-three subjects with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were investigated in this study. The patients had been admitted to our academic hospital from February 28, 2020 to April 19, 2020. Demographic and clinical data, serum 25(OH)D levels, and findings of initial chest computed tomography were recorded. Linear and binary logistic regression, cox regression and ROC curve tests were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 55.18 ± 14.98 years old; 46.4% were male. Mean serum 25(OH)D concentration was significantly lower in the deceased (13.83 ± 12.53 ng/ mL compared with discharged patients (38.41 ± 18.51 ng/mL) (P < 0.001). Higher levels of 25(OH)D were associated with significantly less extent of total lung involvement (ß = - 0.10, P = 0.004). In addition, vitamin D deficiency [25(OH) D < 25 ng/mL] was associated with a significant increase in the risk of mortality (hazard ratio = 4.15, P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that serum vitamin D status might provide useful information regarding the clinical course, extent of lung involvement and outcome of patients with COVID-19. However, further studies with larger sample size are needed to confirm these findings.","Abrishami, Alireza; Dalili, Nooshin; Mohammadi Torbati, Peyman; Asgari, Reyhaneh; Arab-Ahmadi, Mehran; Behnam, Behdad; Sanei-Taheri, Morteza",Eur. j. nutr,,244
505386,Computed tomography and point-of-care ultrasound findings in 2 COVID-19 patients,2020,"BACKGROUND: Viral diseases are responsible for several deaths around the world. Over the past few years, the world has seen several outbreaks caused by viral diseases that for a long time seemed to possess no risk. These are diseases that have been forgotten for a long time and, until nowadays, there are no approved drugs or vaccines, leading the pharmaceutical industry and several research groups to run out of time in the search for new pharmacological treatments or prevention methods. In this context, drug repurposing proves to be a fast and economically viable technique, considering the fact that it uses drugs that have a well-established safety profile. Thus, in this review, we present the main advances in drug repurposing and their benefit for searching new treatments against emerging viral diseases. METHODS: We conducted a search in the bibliographic databases (Science Direct, Bentham Science, PubMed, Springer, ACS Publisher, Wiley, and NIH's COVID-19 Portfolio) using the keywords 'drug repurposing', 'emerging viral infections' and each of the diseases reported here (CoV; ZIKV; DENV; CHIKV; EBOV and MARV) as an inclusion/exclusion criterion. A subjective analysis was performed regarding the quality of the works for inclusion in this manuscript. Thus, the selected works were those that presented drugs repositioned against the emerging viral diseases presented here by means of computational, high-throughput screening or phenotype-based strategies, with no time limit and of relevant scientific value. RESULTS: 291 papers were selected, 24 of which were CHIKV; 52 for ZIKV; 43 for DENV; 35 for EBOV; 10 for MARV; and 56 for CoV and the rest (72 papers) related to the drugs repurposing and emerging viral diseases. Among CoV-related articles, most were published in 2020 (31 papers), updating the current topic. Besides, between the years 2003 - 2005, 10 articles were created, and from 2011 - 2015 there were 7 articles, portraying the outbreaks that occurred at that time. For ZIKV, similar to CoV, most publications were during the period of outbreaks between the years 2016 - 2017 (23 articles). Similarly, most CHIKV (13 papers) and DENV (14 papers) publications occur at the same time interval. For EBOV (13 papers) and MARV (4 papers), they were between the years 2015 - 2016. Through this review, several drugs were highlighted that can be evolved in vivo and clinical trials as possible used against these pathogens showed that remdesivir represent potential treatments against CoV. Furthermore, ribavirin may also be a potential treatment against CHIKV; sofosbuvir against ZIKV; celgosivir against DENV, and favipiravir against EBOV and MARV, representing new hopes against these pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: The conclusions of this review manuscript show the potential of the drug repurposing strategy in the discovery of new pharmaceutical products, as from this approach, drugs that could be used against emerging viral diseases. Thus, this strategy deserves more attention among research groups and is a promising approach to the discovery of new drugs against emerging viral diseases and also other diseases.","Dos Santos Nascimento, Igor José; de Aquino, Thiago Mendonça; da Silva-Júnior, Edeildo Ferreira",Curr. med. chem,,244

METHODS: People with clinically defined diagnosis and undergoing treatment for an ED completed an online survey, which included adapted questions from standardized psychometric scales. Data relative to three different time periods (before, during and after the end of lockdown) were collected. Psychopathological changes over these periods were investigated and compared through one-way analysis of variance or covariance with repeated measures. RESULTS: Three hundred twelve people completed the survey (57.4% diagnosed with Anorexia Nervosa (AN) or atypical AN, 20.2% with Bulimia Nervosa, 15.4% with Binge Eating Disorder, 7.05% with Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorders). The severity of both specific and general psychopathology increased during the lockdown and the rise of general symptoms persisted in the following re-opening phase, except for suicide ideation. Almost all of these findings were not affected by ED diagnosis, participants' age and illness duration. LIMITATIONS: The retrospective nature of data collection is the main limitation of the study. CONCLUSIONS: People with EDs showed a COVID-19 emergency-induced worsening of both general and specific psychopathology. The effect on general psychopathology persisted in the re-opening period. These findings suggest a high stress vulnerability of ED individuals with important effects on internalizing symptoms, which are worth of attention by clinicians.","Monteleone, Alessio Maria; Marciello, Francesca; Cascino, Giammarco; Abbate-Daga, Giovanni; Anselmetti, Simona; Baiano, Monica; Balestrieri, Matteo; Barone, Eugenia; Bertelli, Sara; Carpiniello, Bernardo; Castellini, Giovanni; Corrivetti, Giulio; DE Giorgi, Serafino; Favaro, Angela; Gramaglia, Carla; Marzola, Enrica; Meneguzzo, Paolo; Monaco, Francesco; Oriani, Maria Ginevra; Pinna, Federica; Rania, Marianna; Renna, Caterina; Ricca, Valdo; Salvo, Pierandrea; Segura-Garcia, Cristina; Scarabel, Fabiana; Todisco, Patrizia; Volpe, Umberto; Zeppegno, Patrizia; Monteleone, Palmiero",J Affect Disord,,244

Recognizing this, New York City Health + Hospitals established a clinician-staffed COVID-19 hotline for all New Yorkers. The hotline underwent three phases as the health crisis evolved. As of May 1, 2020, the hotline received over 90,000 calls and was staffed by over 1,000 unique clinicians. Hotline clinicians provided New Yorkers with clinical assessment and guidance, registered them for home symptom monitoring, connected them to social services, and provided a source of up-to-date answers to COVID-19 questions. By connecting New Yorkers with hotline providers, regardless of their regular avenues of accessing care, the hotline aimed to ease the pressures on the City's overtaxed emergency medical services. Future consideration should be given to promoting easy access to clinician hotlines by disadvantaged communities early in a public health crisis as well as evaluating the impact of clinician hotlines on clinical outcomes.

The effects of NET of varying durations on pathologic response are unclear. Using the National Cancer Database (NCDB), we evaluated objective response to short (< 9 weeks), moderate (9-27 weeks), and long (> 27 weeks) duration of NET. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study cohort included female patients diagnosed with nonmetastatic invasive HR+ breast cancer, stratifying by those who received NET versus no NET between 2004 and 2016. Pathologic response was grouped into four categories (complete, downstaged, stable, upstaged) by comparing clinical and pathologic staging data. Objective response to NET included complete, downstaged, and stable pathologic response. Clinical characteristics were compared using &#967;2 and analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with NET use and objective response according to NET duration. RESULTS: A minority (1.2%) received NET in our cohort. Factors associated with NET use included older age, non-Black patients, more advanced clinical stage, higher comorbidity score, government insurance, and lobular histology. Objective response rate (ORR) was 56.7%, 52.1%, and 49.0% after short, moderate, and long NET duration, respectively. CONCLUSION: Short NET duration did not result in an inferior ORR. Future study to evaluate the interaction between surgery delay and NET use on clinical outcome will provide insights into the safety of NET to bridge potential surgery delay in patients with HR+ breast cancer.","Goldbach, Macy M; Burkbauer, Laura; Bharani, Tina; Williams, Austin D; Keele, Luke; Rothman, Jami; Jankowitz, Rachel; Tchou, Julia C",Ann. surg. oncol,,244

OBJECTIVE: To determine ED volumes and triage acuity prior to and after COVID-19. METHODS: We determined the volume of patients presenting to four large EDs affiliated with general, cardiac, cancer, and obstetrics hospitals, and the acuity of presenting illness (using the Canadian Triage Acuity Scale [CTAS]) for March and April 2020 and compared them with the same months in 2019 and January 2020. Together, these facilities see over 80% of the ED visits in Qatar. The first COVID-19 patient in Qatar was diagnosed on February 29, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 192,157 ED visits were recorded during the study period. There was a 20-43% overall drop in number of ED visits, with significant variability across hospitals. The Heart Hospital experienced the sharpest decline (33-89%), and the National Center for Cancer Care and Research experienced the least decline in volumes. The decline was observed across all CTAS levels, with the largest decline observed in individuals presenting with CTAS 1 and 2 (26-69% decline month by month). No increase in overall number of deaths or crude mortality rate was observed in the COVID-19 era, according to national statistics. CONCLUSIONS: Sharp declines in ED visits and the triage acuity seen in both general and specialty hospitals raise the concern that severely ill patients may not be seeking timely care, and a surge may be expected once current restrictions on movement are lifted.","Butt, Adeel A; Azad, Aftab M; Kartha, Anand B; Masoodi, Naseer A; Bertollini, Roberto; Abou-Samra, Abdul-Badi",J. emerg. med,,244

This survey represents an overview of the current policies regarding the surgical management of patients with GD during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A Web-based survey was conducted among 36 Hepato-Prancreato-Biliary surgeons from 14 Countries. Through a 17-item questionnaire, participants were asked about the local management of patients with GD since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: The majority (n = 26,72.2%) of surgeons reported an alarming decrease in the cholecystectomy rate for GD since the start of the pandemic, regardless of the Country: 19(52.7%) didn't operate any GD, 7(19.4%) reduced their surgical activity by 50–75%, 10(27.8%) by 25–50%, 1(2.8%) maintained regular activity. Currently, only patients with GD complications are operated. Thirty-two (88.9%) participants expect these changes to last for at least 3 months. In 15(41.6%) Centers, patients are currently being screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection before cholecystectomy [in 10(27.8%) Centers only in the presence of suspected infection, in 5(13.9%) routinely]. The majority of surgeons (n = 29,80.6%) have adopted a laparoscopic approach as standard surgery, 5(13.9%) perform open cholecystectomy in patients with known/suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, and 2(5.6%) in all patients. Conclusion: In the ongoing COVID-19 emergency, the surgical treatment of GD is postponed, resulting in a huge number of untreated patients who could develop severe morbidity. Updated guidelines and dedicated pathways for patients with benign disease awaiting elective surgery are mandatory to prevent further aggravation of the overloaded healthcare systems.","Manzia, Tommaso Maria; Angelico, Roberta; Parente, Alessandro; Muiesan, Paolo; Tisone, Giuseppe; Al Alawy, Yousef; Arif, Abdul Jabba; Attia, Magdy; Bhati, Chandra; Battula R, Narendra; Bonney, Glenn Kunnath; Brooke-Smith, Mark; Derosas, Carlos; De Liguori Carino, Nicola; Ferretti, Stefano; Fiorani, Cristina; Gherardi, Dario; Hegab, Bassem; Hussain, Zaki; Ielpo, Benedetto; Iesari, Samuele; Lai, Quirino; Lainas, Panagiotis; Lauterio, Andrea; Lazzaro, Alessandra; Marudanayagam, Ravi; Nasralla, David; Nicolini, Daniele; Orlando, Giuseppe; Patrono, Damiano; Pitchaimuthu, Maheswaran; Polak, Wojciech; Quinto, Alberto Marcacuzco; Rai, Rakesh; Scalera, Irene; Schlegel, Andrea; Shanmugam, Vivek; Vitale, Alessandro; Widmer, Jeannette; Yannick, Deswysen",Ann.

508736,"Etiology and antimicrobial resistance of secondary bacterial infections in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective analysis",2020,"ABSTRACT As another wave of COVID-19 outbreak has approached in July 2020, a larger scale COVID-19 pediatric Asian cohort summarizing the clinical observations is warranted. Children confirmed with COVID-19 infection from the Republic of Korea, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) and Wuhan, China, during their first waves of local outbreaks were included. Their clinical characteristics and the temporal sequences of the first waves of local paediatric outbreaks were compared. Four hundred and twenty three children with COVID-19 were analyzed. Wuhan had the earliest peak, followed by Korea and HKSAR. Compared with Korea and Wuhan, patients in HKSAR were significantly older (mean age: 12.9 vs. 10.8 vs. 6.6 years, p < 0.001, respectively) and had more imported cases (87.5% vs. 16.5% vs. 0%, p < 0.001, respectively). The imported cases were also older (13.4 vs. 7.6 years, p < 0.001). More cases in HKSAR were asymptomatic compared to Korea and Wuhan (45.5% vs. 22.0% vs. 20.9%, p < 0.001, respectively), and significantly more patients from Wuhan developed fever (40.6% vs. 29.7% vs. 21.6%, p=0.003, respectively). There were significantly less imported cases than domestic cases developing fever after adjusting for age and region of origin (p = 0.046). 5.4% to 10.8% of patients reported anosmia and ageusia. None developed pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PMIS-TS). In general, adolescents were more likely to be asymptomatic and less likely to develop fever, but required longer hospital stays. In conclusion, majority patients in this pediatric Asian cohort had a mild disease. None developed PIMS-TS. Their clinical characteristics were influenced by travel history and age.","Chua, Gilbert T; Xiong, Xiaoli; Choi, Eun Hwa; Han, Mi Seon; Chang, Sung Hee; Jin, Byoung Lo; Lee, Eun Joo; Kim, Baek Nam; Kim, Min Kyoung; Doo, Kihyun; Seo, Ju Hee; Kim, Yae Jean; Kim, Yeo Jin; Park, Ji Young; Suh, Sun Bok; Lee, Hyunju; Cho, Eun Young; Kim, Dong Hyun; Kim, Jong Min; Kim, Hye Young; Park, Su Eun; Lee, Joon Kee; Jo, Dae Sun; Cho, Seung Man; Choi, Jae Hong; Jo, Kyo Jin; Choe, Young June; Kim, Ki Hwan; Chi, Shuiqing; Tang, Shao-Tao; Qin, Huan; Zhou, Li Shan; Chen, Peng; Wong, Joshua Sung Chih; Chan, Kate Ching Ching; Yau, Felix Yat Sun; Lam, Shu Yan; Chow, Calvin Chit Kwong; Wong, Tak Wai; Chan, Victor Chi-Man; Poon, Grace Wing Kit; Chow, Chun Bong; Wong, Wilfred H S; Lau, Yu Lung; Chan, Godfrey Chi Fung; Chui, Celine S L; Li, Xue; Ho, Marco Hok Kung; Wong, Ian C K; Tam, Paul Kwong Hang",Emerg Microbes Infect,,244

COVID-19 related waste is a threat to global public environmental health. Medical waste management during this pandemic is one of the major issues facing public service organizations such as municipalities, which is of great importance in terms of logistics, environment and social aspects. The discussion of logistics operations is related to the collection, transportation and disposal of waste, which imposes high expenses. Many methods have been applied to develop and improve waste management policies in the literature. Apart from these studies, very few researchers have improved vehicle operations in waste management considering environmental aspects and the possibility of outsourcing. In this paper, by examining the gaps in the field, we try to explain and formulate the sustainable medical waste management problem for pandemics. Finally, by designing several practical examples with different scales, we solve the problem using CPLEX solver, compare different conditions and discuss the practical implications using the sensitivity analysis of demand parameter.","Babaee Tirkolaee, Erfan; Aydin, Nadi Serhan",Waste Manag Res,,244

509534,"The challenge of resuming classes for young students in Wuhan, China",2020,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are an integral component of the host competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network. These noncoding RNAs are characterized by their unique splicing reactions to form covalently closed loop structures and play important RNA regulatory roles in cells. Recent studies showed that circRNA expressions were perturbed in viral infections and circRNAs might serve as potential antiviral targets. We investigated the host ceRNA network changes and biological relevance of circRNAs in human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial (Calu-3) cells infected with the highly pathogenic Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). A total of &#8805;49337 putative circRNAs were predicted. Among the 7845 genes which generated putative circRNAs, 147 (1.9%) of them each generated &#8805;30 putative circRNAs and were involved in various biological, cellular, and metabolic processes, including viral infections. Differential expression (DE) analysis showed that the proportion of DE circRNAs significantly (P < 0.001) increased at 24 h-post infection. These DE circRNAs were clustered into 4 groups according to their time-course expression patterns and demonstrated inter-cluster and intra-cluster variations in the predicted functions of their host genes. Our comprehensive circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network identified 7 key DE circRNAs involved in various biological processes upon MERS-CoV infection. Specific siRNA knockdown of two selected DE circRNAs (circFNDC3B and circCNOT1) significantly reduced MERS-CoV load and their target mRNA expression which modulates various biological pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and ubiquitination pathways. These results provided novel insights into the ceRNA network perturbations, biological relevance of circRNAs, and potential host-targeting antiviral strategies for MERS-CoV infection.","Zhang, Xi; Chu, Hin; Wen, Lei; Shuai, Huiping; Yang, Dong; Wang, Yixin; Hou, Yuxin; Zhu, Zheng; Yuan, Shuofeng; Yin, Feifei; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Emerg Microbes Infect,,244
509867,"Predicting severe or critical symptoms in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 from Yichang, China",2020,"Most countries have been struggling with the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic imposing social isolation on their citizens. However, this measure carried risks for people's mental health. This study evaluated the psychological repercussions of objective isolation in 1,006 Italians during the first, especially strict, lockdown in spring 2020. Although varying for the regional spread-rate of the contagion, results showed that the longer the isolation and the less adequate the physical space where people were isolated, the worse the mental health (e.g., depression). Offline social contacts buffered the association between social isolation and mental health. However, when offline contacts were limited, online contacts seemed crucial in protecting mental health. The findings inform about the potential downsides of the massive social isolation imposed by COVID-19 spread, highlighting possible risk factors and resources to account for implementing such isolation measures. Specifically, besides some known factors such as physical space availability, the local contagion rate is critical in moderating the link between social isolation and mental health issues, supporting national policies implementing regional tiers of restriction severity.","Pancani, L.; Marinucci, M.; Aureli, N.; Riva, P.",Frontiers in Psychology,,244

METHODS: 75 COVID-19 patients were collected from the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and they were classified into moderate, severe and critically severe types according to the disease severity. The basic information, blood routine, pneumonia-related blood indexes, immune-related indexes along with liver, kidney and myocardial indexes in patients with different types were analyzed. RESULTS: The analysis of immune-related indexes showed that the proportions of critically severe patients with abnormal IL-2 and IL-4 were higher than those of severe and moderate patients. In addition, the proportion of patients with abnormal total cholesterol increased as the severity of disease increased, and the proportion in critically severe patients was significantly higher than that in moderate patients. CONCLUSIONS: The patients with a more severe COVID-19 are older and more likely to have a history of hypertension. With the progression of COVID-19, the abnormal proportion of total white blood cell, neutrophils, lymphocytes, IL-2, IL-4 and total cholesterol increased. The change of these indexes in patients with different COVID-19 types could provide reference for the disease severity identification and diagnosis of COVID-19. In addition, the change in the total cholesterol level suggested that COVID-19 would induce some liver function damage in patients. This article is protected by copyright.

Controlling of COVID-19 spreading rate in the social environment is a challenge for all individuals. In the present study, simulation of the lockdown effect on the COVID-19 spreading rate in India and mapping of its recovery percentage (until May, 2020) were investigated. Investigation of the lockdown impact dependent on first order reaction kinetics demonstrated higher effect of lockdown 1 on controlling the COVID-19 spreading rate when contrasted with lockdown 2 and 3. Although decreasing trend was followed for the reaction rate constant of different lockdown stages, the distinction between the lockdown 2 and 3 was minimal. Mathematical and feed forward neural network (FFNN) approaches were applied for the simulation of COVID-19 spreading rate. In case of mathematical approach, exponential model indicated adequate performance for the prediction of the spreading rate behavior. For the FFNN based modeling, 1-5-1 was selected as the best architecture so as to predict adequate spreading rate for all the cases. The architecture also showed effective performance in order to forecast number of cases for next 14 days. The recovery percentage was modeled as a function of number of days with the assistance of polynomial fitting. Therefore, the investigation recommends proper social distancing and efficient management of corona virus in order to achieve higher decreasing trend of reaction rate constant and required recovery percentage for the stabilization of India.","Chakraborty, Sourav; Choudhary, Arun Kumar; Sarma, Mausumi; Hazarika, Manuj Kumar",,,244
514766,A case report of simultaneous autoimmune and COVID-19 encephalitis,2021,"Anesthesia is used to sedate aquatic animals during transportation or to immobilize them for surgery. However, most studies have focused on the behavioral effects of induction and recovery, without addressing the effect of anesthetic on neural activity. This study investigated the neural response of anterior lateral line afferent fibers in the oyster toadfish, Opsanus tau, during exposure to incremental increases of AQUI-S 20E (0.001-0.006%), to determine if eugenol (the active ingredient of AQUI-S 20E) influences neural activity of the fish lateral line system. Ventilation rate significantly decreased following AQUI-S 20E exposure with the surgical plane of anesthesia reached at 0.003%, characterized by shallow ventilation, equilibrium loss, and no response to tactile stimuli. Spontaneous and evoked firing rates of anterior lateral line fibers also significantly decreased following exposure, although the effect was transitory as neural activity recovered in the majority of fibers (70%) within 30 min of anesthetic withdrawal. While AQUI-S 20E proved effective in inducing the surgical plane of anesthesia without compromising survival, it is not recommended for acute neural preparations due to its depression of neural activity. However, the depression of lateral line sensitivity at low concentrations could play a role in reducing the stress response during fish transport.","Putland, Rosalyn; Rogers, Loranzie; Giuffrida, Beth; Mensinger, Allen",,,244

Among survivors, kidney outcomes, seroconversion, and persistence of viral shedding are unexplored. METHODS: Single-center prospective cohort study including data from kidney transplant recipients with confirmed COVID-19 between March 20, 2020 and July 31, 2020. Outcomes were adjudicated until August 31, 2020 or the date of death. RESULTS: There were 491 patients with COVID-19 among the 11 875 recipients in follow-up. The majority were middle aged with &#8805;1 comorbidities. Thirty-one percent were treated at home, and 69% required hospitalization. Among the hospitalized, 61% needed intensive care, 75% presented allograft dysfunction, and 46% needed dialysis. The overall 28-day fatality rate was 22% and among hospitalized patients it was 41%. Age (odds ratio, 3.08; 95% confidence interval, 1.86-5.09), diabetes mellitus (odds ratio, 1.69; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-2.72), and cardiac disease (odds ratio, 2.00; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-3.68) were independent factors for death. Among the 351 survivors, 19% sustained renal graft dysfunction, and there were 13 (4%) graft losses. Biopsy (n = 20) findings were diverse but decisive to guide treatment and estimate prognosis. Seroconversion was observed in 79% of the survivors and was associated with disease severity. Persistence of viral shedding was observed in 21% of the patients without detectable clinical implications. CONCLUSIONS: This prospective cohort analysis confirms the high 28-day fatality rate of COVID-19, associated primarily with age and comorbidities. The high incidence of allograft dysfunction was associated with a wide range of specific histologic lesions and high rates of sequelae and graft loss.

There has been a rapid evolution of evidence, establishing an increased risk of morbidity and mortality associated with diabetes and concurrent COVID-19. The objective of this review is to explore the current evidence for inpatient assessment and management of diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight areas requiring further exploration. METHODS: A literature search of databases was conducted to November 2020 using variations on keywords SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, SARS, MERS and diabetes. Information relating to the impact of diabetes on severity of COVID-19 infection, the impact of COVID-19 infection on diabetes management and diabetes-related complications was integrated to create a narrative review. DISCUSSION: People with diabetes and COVID-19 are at an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. It is important that people with both known and previously unrecognised diabetes and COVID-19 be promptly identified and assessed during acute illness, with close monitoring for clinical deterioration or complications. People with diabetes may require titration or alteration of their glycaemic management due to the potential for worse outcomes with hyperglycaemia and COVID-19 infection. Comprehensive discharge planning is vital to optimise ongoing glycaemic management. CONCLUSION: Further understanding of the risk of adverse outcomes and optimisation of glycaemic management for people with diabetes during COVID-19 is required to improve outcomes. Increased glucose and ketone monitoring, substitution of insulin for some oral anti-hyperglycaemic medications and careful monitoring for complications of diabetes such as diabetic ketoacidosis should be considered.","Fleming, Nicola; Sacks, Lori J; Pham, Cecilia T; Neoh, Sandra L; Ekinci, Elif I",Diabet Med,,244

Identification of neutralizing antibodies (NAb) and understanding their role is important. However, the data on kinetics of NAb response among COVID-19 patients are unclear. To understand the NAb response in COVID-19 patients, we compared the findings of microneutralization test (MNT) and plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) for the SARS-CoV-2. Further, the kinetics of NAb response among COVID-19 patients was assessed. Methods: A total of 343 blood samples (89 positive, 58 negative for SARS-CoV-2 and 17 cross-reactive and 179 serum from healthy individuals) were collected and tested by MNT and PRNT. SARS-CoV-2 virus was prepared by propagating the virus in Vero CCL-81 cells. The intra-class correlation was calculated to assess the correlation between MNT and PRNT. The neutralizing endpoint as the reduction in the number of plaque count by 90 per cent (PRNT90) was also calculated. Results: The analysis of MNT and PRNT quantitative results indicated that the intra-class correlation was 0.520. Of the 89 confirmed COVID-19 patients, 64 (71.9%) showed NAb response. Interpretation & conclusions: The results of MNT and PRNT were specific with no cross-reactivity. In the early stages of infection, the NAb response was observed with variable antibody kinetics. The neutralization assays can be used for titration of NAb in recovered/vaccinated or infected COVID-19 patients.","Deshpande, Gururaj Rao; Sapkal, Gajanan N; Tilekar, Bipin N; Yadav, Pragya D; Gurav, Yogesh; Gaikwad, Shivshankar; Kaushal, Himanshu; Deshpande, Ketki S; Kaduskar, Ojas; Sarkale, Prasad; Baradkar, Srikant; Suryawanshi, Annasaheb; Lakra, Rajen; Sugunan, A P; Balakrishnan, Anukumar; Abraham, Priya; Salve, Pavan",Indian J Med Res,,244

The estimating parameter of the proportion of people who die compared to the number of people who test positive for coronavirus (parameter of CFR) can be determined using the Bayesian method approach. The estimation parameter of CFR is performed by using prior beta distribution, and the results have good performance with a high degree of accuracy. The choice of Bayesian model that can be built is a fixed effect model where the proportion of case deaths in each province is assumed to be mutually independent. Still, the movement of people between regions continues to occur so that a random effect model is more rational to be applied where the proportion of case deaths for each province is assumed to be the same as estimating parameter of CFR which is smaller than the current condition of Indonesia. The estimation parameter results of the CFR parameters are expected to be achieved by the Indonesian government by implementing Covid-19 controls system for each province as a mitigation diseases strategy.","Devianto, D.; Afifah, A.

Application of the ERAS protocol to colorectal cancer surgery has been limited to a minority of hospitals in Italy. To promote the systematic adoption of ERAS in the entire regional hospital network in Piemonte an Audit and Feedback approach (A&F) has been adopted together with a cluster randomised trial to estimate the true impact of the protocol on a large, unselected population. METHODS: A multicentre stepped wedge cluster randomised trial is designed for comparison between standard perioperative management and the management according to the ERAS protocol. The primary outcome is the length of hospital stay (LOS). Secondary outcomes are: incidence of postoperative complications, time to patients' recovery, control of pain and patients' satisfaction. With an A&F approach the adherence to the ERAS items is monitored through a dedicated area in the study web site. The study includes 28 surgical centres, stratified by activity volume and randomly divided into four groups. Each group is randomly assigned to a different activation period of the ERAS protocol. There are four activation periods, one every 3 months. However, the planned calendar and the total duration of the study have been extended by 6 months due to the COVID-19 pandemic.The expected sample size of about 2200 patients has a high statistical power (98%) to detect a reduction of LOS of 1 day and to estimate clinically meaningful changes in the other endpoints. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study protocol has been approved by the Ethical Committee of the coordinating centre and by all participating centres. Study results will be timely circulated within the hospital network and published in peer-reviewed journals.

590139,Euglycemic DKA (euDKA) as a presentation of COVID‐19,2020-11-20,"Cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 requires the binding between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral Spike protein and the cellular angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). As such, RBD has become the major target for vaccine development, whereas RBD-specific antibodies are pursued as therapeutics. Here, we report the development and characterization of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific V(H)H/nanobody (Nb) from immunized alpacas. Seven RBD-specific Nbs with high stability were identified using phage display. They bind to SARS-CoV-2 RBD with affinity K(D) ranging from 2.6 to 113 nM, and six of them can block RBD-ACE2 interaction. The fusion of the Nbs with IgG1 Fc resulted in homodimers with greatly improved RBD-binding affinities (K(D) ranging from 72.7 pM to 4.5 nM) and nanomolar RBD-ACE2 blocking abilities. Furthermore, the fusion of two Nbs with nonoverlapping epitopes resulted in hetero-bivalent Nbs, namely, aRBD-2-5 and aRBD-2-7, with significantly higher RBD binding affinities (K(D) of 59.2 pM and 0.25 nM) and greatly enhanced SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing potency. The 50% neutralization doses of aRBD-2-5 and aRBD-2-7 were 1.22 ng/ml (∼0.043 nM) and 3.18 ng/ml (∼0.111 nM), respectively. These high-affinity SARS-CoV-2 blocking Nbs could be further developed into therapeutics, as well as diagnostic reagents for COVID-19. IMPORTANCE To date, SARS-CoV-2 has caused tremendous loss of human life and economic output worldwide. Although a few COVID-19 vaccines have been approved in several countries, the development of effective therapeutics, including SARS-CoV-2 targeting antibodies, remains critical. Due to their small size (13 to 15 kDa), high solubility, and stability, Nbs are particularly well suited for pulmonary delivery and more amenable to engineer into multivalent formats than the conventional antibody. Here, we report a series of new anti-SARS-CoV-2 Nbs isolated from immunized alpaca and two engineered hetero-bivalent Nbs. These potent neutralizing Nbs showed promise as potential therapeutics against COVID-19.","Ma, Huan; Zeng, Weihong; Meng, Xiangzhi; Huang, Xiaoxue; Yang, Yunru; Zhao, Dan; Zhou, Peigen; Wang, Xiaofang; Zhao, Changcheng; Sun, Yong; Wang, Peihui; Ou, Huichao; Hu, Xiaowen; Xiang, Yan; Jin, Tengchuan",J Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33658349/; https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02438-20,244

The presence or absence of such antibodies can potentially lead to considerations regarding immunity and infection. ISSUE: How reliable are inferences from positive or negative test results regarding the actual presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies? METHODS: Calculation of the probability that, depending on the pretest probability (prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection) and test properties, antibodies are present or absent in the case of positive or negative test results. RESULTS: Sensitivity and specificity of different SARS-CoV-2 AB test systems vary between 53 % and 94 % and between 91 % and 99.5 %, respectively. When using a test with high test quality, the positive predictive value (PPV) is 42 % and 7 9%, respectively, with a pre-test probability of 1 % to 5 %, as can currently be assumed for the general population in Austria or Germany. For persons with an increased pre-test probability of 20 %, e. g. persons from high-risk professions, the PPW is 95 %, with a pre-test probability of 80 % the PPW is almost 100 %. The negative predictive value (NPV) is at least 99.7 % for persons with a low pre-test probability of up to 5 % and 79.1 % for persons with a pre-test probability of 80 %. When using test systems with lower sensitivity and specificity, the reliability of the results decreases considerably. The PPV is 5.9 % with a pre-test probability of 1 %. CONCLUSIONS: A sufficiently high sensitivity and specificity are prerequisites for the application of antibody test systems. Positive test results are often false if the pre-test probability is low. Depending on the assumed prevalence of a SARS-CoV-2 infection, there are substantial differences in the significance of a concrete test result for the respective affected persons.","Horvath, Karl; Semlitsch, Thomas; Jeitler, Klaus; Krause, Robert; Siebenhofer, Andrea",Z Evid Fortbild Qual Gesundhwes,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.zefq.2020.05.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32419875/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1865921720300490; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1865921720300490,244

Disease-related worry can help disease prevention and management, but can also have a detrimental effect. This study measured the overall level of disease-related worry during the MERS outbreak period in Korea and the influencing factors and levels of disease-related worry during key outbreak periods. METHODS: The cross-sectional survey included 1,000 adults who resided in Korea. An ordinal logistic regression was performed for the overall level of MERS-related worry, and influencing factors of worry were analyzed. A reliability test was performed on the levels of MERS-related worry during key outbreak periods. RESULTS: The overall level of MERS-related worry was 2.44. Multivariate analysis revealed that women and respondents w very poor subjective health status had higher levels of worry. Respondents with very high stress in daily life had higher levels of worry than those who reported having little stress. The reliability test results on MERS-related worry scores during key outbreak periods showed consistent scores during each period. CONCLUSION: Level of worry increased in cases having higher perceived susceptibility and greater trust in informal information, while initial stage of outbreak was closely associated with that at later stages. These findings suggest the importance of managing the level of worry by providing timely and accurate disease-related information during the initial stage of disease outbreak.","Ro, Jun-Soo; Lee, Jin-Seok; Kang, Sung-Chan; Jung, Hye-Min",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28273131/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0173234,244

This shift in resources has created a complex new model for reinvestment in the medical community in which the vast majority of private funds are redirected towards influencing the prescription behaviour of practitioners through ‘key opinion leaders’, with the main purpose of enhancing and perpetuating profit rather than innovation and critical thinking, and often at the expense of partnerships with scientists (that is, basic and translational researchers) and academic collaborations. This new episteme brings multiple opportunities to rethink approaches to sustaining long-term critical research in the field, ultimately maximizing the return on investment: scientific knowledge for the benefit of patients and society.

Methods: Baseline and daily indicators were evaluated using electronic health records for 46,971 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 from 176 HCA Healthcare-affiliated hospitals, presenting from March to September 2020, to develop a real-time risk model (RTRM) of all-cause, hospitalized mortality. Patient facility, dates-of-care, clinico-demographics, comorbidities, vitals, laboratory markers, and respiratory support findings were aggregated in a logistic regression model. Findings: The RTRM predicted overall mortality as well as mortality 1, 3, and 7 days in advance with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCROC) of 0.905, 0.911, 0.905, and 0.901 respectively, significantly outperforming a combined model of age and daily modified WHO progression scale (all p<0.0001; AUCROC, 0.846, 0.848, 0.850, and 0.852). The RTRM delineated risk at presentation from ongoing risk associated with medical care and showed that mortality rates decreased over time due to both decreased severity and changes in care. Interpretation: To our knowledge, this study is the largest of its kind to comprehensively evaluate predictors and incorporate daily risk measures of COVID-19 mortality. The RTRM validates current literature trends in mortality across time and allows direct translation for research and clinical applications.","Schlauch, D.; Fisher, A.

Despite the vaccine being locally and freely available in the entire country. Comparing crude coverage between localities and population groups is misleading because of differing age structures in different population groups. In order to describe inequalities in COVID19 vaccine initiation we determined differences in age-specific dose 1 vaccine coverage between the main population groups in Israel, and characterised the influence of age on vaccine coverage within each of these groups. Methods: We obtained daily doses administered by municipality and age from the Ministry of Health, and demographic data from the Central Bureau of Statistics. We determined whether the relative proportion of people vaccinated in each age group (15-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60+) changed by population group (General Jewish, Ultra-Orthodox and Arab) using ANOVA and quantified association between age, population group and vaccine coverage using binomial regression. Results: 8,507,723 individuals in 268 localities were included. Compared with the General Jewish population, vaccine coverage was lower among the Arab and Ultra-Orthodox populations and lowest in the Ultra-Orthodox population in all age groups. Gaps between population groups differed according to age group (p<0.001). In all populations, coverage decreased with decreasing age (p<0.001). The Ultra-orthodox population was the least vaccinated in all age groups relatively to those aged 60 and over. Conclusions: In all age groups, the Ultra-Orthodox population had the lowest vaccine coverage. The younger the age group, the more Ultra-Orthodox Jews are diverging from their age peers in terms of initiating COVID19 vaccination. These findings suggest generational differences in terms of vaccination behaviour in this group. Qualitative studies understanding the causes behind this divergence can inform tailored vaccination strategies.","Gorelik, Y.; Edelstein, M.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.14.21258882v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.14.21258882,244

Emerging evidence has demonstrated that endothelial dysfunction precipitates COVID-19 and its accompanying multi-organ injuries. Thus, pharmacotherapies targeting endothelial dysfunction have potential to ameliorate COVID-19 and its cardiovascular complications. The objective of the present study is to evaluate whether kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2), a master regulator of vascular homeostasis, represents a therapeutic target for COVID-19-induced endothelial dysfunction. Here, we demonstrate that the expression of KLF2 was reduced and monocyte adhesion was increased in endothelial cells treated with COVID-19 patient serum due to elevated levels of pro-adhesive molecules, ICAM1 and VCAM1. IL-1β and TNF-α, two cytokines elevated in cytokine release syndrome in COVID-19 patients, decreased KLF2 gene expression. Pharmacologic (atorvastatin and tannic acid) and genetic (adenoviral overexpression) approaches to augment KLF2 levels attenuated COVID-19-serum-induced increase in endothelial inflammation and monocyte adhesion. Next-generation RNA-sequencing data showed that atorvastatin treatment leads to a cardiovascular protective transcriptome associated with improved endothelial function (vasodilation, anti-inflammation, antioxidant status, anti-thrombosis/-coagulation, anti-fibrosis, and reduced angiogenesis). Finally, knockdown of KLF2 partially reversed the ameliorative effect of atorvastatin on COVID-19-serum-induced endothelial inflammation and monocyte adhesion. Collectively, the present study implicates loss of KLF2 as an important molecular event in the development of COVID-19-induced vascular disease and suggests that efforts to augment KLF2 levels may be therapeutically beneficial.","Xu, Suowen; Liu, Yujie; Ding, Yu; Luo, Sihui; Zheng, Xueying; Wu, Xiumei; Liu, Zhenghong; Ilyas, Iqra; Chen, Suyu; Han, Shuxin; Little, Peter J.; Jain, Mukesh K.; Weng, Jianping",Signal Transduct Target Ther,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-021-00690-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34253708/,244

The vaccine development is an ongoing process, although some vaccines got marketed. The big challenge is now whether the vaccine candidates can provide long-lasting protection or prevention against mutant variants. METHODS: The information was gathered from various journals, electronic searches via Internet-based information such as PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct, online electronic journals, WHO landscape, world meters, WHO website, and News. RESULTS: This review will present and discuss some coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) related aspects including: the pathophysiology, epidemiology, mutant variants vaccine candidates, vaccine efficacy, and management strategies. Due to the high death rate, continuous spread, an inadequate workforce, lack of required therapeutics, and incomplete understanding of the viral strain, it becomes crucial to build the knowledge of its biological characteristics and make available the rapid diagnostic and vital therapeutic machinery for the combat and management of an infection. CONCLUSION: The data summarizes current research on the COVID 19 infection and therapeutic interventions, which will direct future decision-making on the effort-worthy phases of the COVID 19 and the development of critical therapeutics. The only possible solution is the vaccine development targeting against all variant strains to halt its progress; the identified theoretical and practical knowledge can eliminate the gaps to improve a better understanding of the novel coronavirus structure and its design of a vaccine. In addition, to that the long-lasting protection is another challenging objective that need to be looked into.","Farooqi, Tahmeena; Malik, Jonaid Ahmad; Mulla, Almas Hanif; Al Hagbani, Turki; Almansour, Khaled; Ubaid, Mohammed Abrar; Alghamdi, Saleh; Anwar, Sirajudheen",J Infect Public Health,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S187603412100232X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2021.08.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34429257/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187603412100232X?v=s5,244

Angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is the host receptor by 2019-nCov to infect human cells. Although ACE2 is reported to be expressed in lung, liver, stomach, ileum, kidney and colon, its expressing levels are rather low, especially in the lung. 2019-nCoV may use co-receptors/auxiliary proteins as ACE2 partner to facilitate the virus entry. To identify the potential candidates, we explored the single cell gene expression atlas including 119 cell types of 13 human tissues and analyzed the single cell co-expression spectrum of 51 reported RNA virus receptors and 400 other membrane proteins. Consistent with other recent reports, we confirmed that ACE2 was mainly expressed in lung AT2, liver cholangiocyte, colon colonocytes, esophagus keratinocytes, ileum ECs, rectum ECs, stomach epithelial cells, and kidney proximal tubules. Intriguingly, we found that the candidate co-receptors, manifesting the most similar expression patterns with ACE2 across 13 human tissues, are all peptidases, including ANPEP, DPP4 and ENPEP. Among them, ANPEP and DPP4 are the known receptors for human CoVs, suggesting ENPEP as another potential receptor for human CoVs. We also conducted “CellPhoneDB” analysis to understand the cell crosstalk between CoV-targets and their surrounding cells across different tissues. We found that macrophages frequently communicate with the CoVs targets through chemokine and phagocytosis signaling, highlighting the importance of tissue macrophages in immune defense and immune pathogenesis.","Qi, Furong; Qian, Shen; Zhang, Shuye; Zhang, Zheng",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.16.951913,244

However, in the few months of the pandemic, data generated on host genetics has been scarce. The present study retrieved data sets of HLA-B alleles, KIR genes and functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in cytokines related to COVID-19 cytokine storm from two publicly available databases: Allele Frequency Net Database and Ensembl, and correlated these frequency data with Case Fatality Rate (CFR) and Daily Death Rates (DDR) across countries. Correlations of eight HLA-B alleles and polymorphisms in three cytokine genes (IL6, IL10, and IL12B) were observed and were mainly associated with DDR. Additionally, HLA-B correlations suggest that differences in allele affinities to SARS-CoV-2 peptides are also associated with DDR.

Methods: We searched PubMed, PubMed Central, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between 1994 and July 2020. We included RCTs with greater than 90% of participants free of CVD. Two reviewers independently screened the articles using the Covidence software, assessed the methodological quality using the risk of bias 2 tool, and analyzed the data using the RevMan 5.4 software. Results: Eleven trials were included. Statin therapy was associated with a decreased risk of myocardial infarction (RR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.47 to 0.67), major cerebrovascular events (RR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.63 to 0.96), major coronary events (RR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.57 to 0.80), composite cardiovascular outcome (RR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.62 to 0.82), revascularizations (RR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.57 to 0.74), angina (RR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.63 to 0.92), and hospitalization for cardiovascular causes (RR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.64 to 0.86). There was no benefit associated with statin therapy for cardiovascular mortality and coronary heart disease mortality. All-cause mortality benefit with statin therapy was seen in the population with diabetes and increased risk of CVD. Statin therapy was associated with no significant increased risk of myalgia, creatine kinase elevation, rhabdomyolysis, myopathy, incidence of any cancer, incidence of diabetes, withdrawal of the drug due to adverse events, serious adverse events, fatal cancer, and liver enzyme abnormalities. Conclusion: Statin therapy was associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and procedures without increased risk of harm in populations with mean LDL-C in the near-optimal to the borderline high range and without prior atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.","Singh, Bishnu M; Lamichhane, Hari K; Srivatsa, Sanjay S; Adhikari, Prabhat; Kshetri, Bikash J; Khatiwada, Sijan; Shrestha, Dhan B",Adv Prev Med,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/6617905; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33294229/,244

However, the response to CTAs has been tepid. For example, in France less than 2 million people (roughly 3% of the population) downloaded the CTA. Against this background, we carry out an online experiment to show that CTAs can still play a key role in containing the spread of COVID-19, provided that they are re-conceptualized to account for insights from behavioral science. We start by showing that carefully devised in-app notifications are effective in inducing prudent behavior like wearing a mask or staying home. In particular, people that are notified that they are taking too much risk and could become a superspreader engage in more prudent behavior. Building on this result, we suggest that CTAs should be re-framed as Behavioral Feedback Apps (BFAs). The main function of BFAs would be providing users with information on how to minimize the risk of contracting COVID-19, like how crowded a store is likely to be. Moreover, the BFA could have a rating system that allows users to flag stores that do not respect safety norms like wearing masks. These functions can inform the behavior of app users, thus playing a key role in containing the spread of the virus even if a small percentage of people download the BFA. While effective contact tracing is impossible when only 3% of the population downloads the app, less risk taking by small portions of the population can produce large benefits. BFAs can be programmed so that users can also activate a tracing function akin to the one currently carried out by CTAs. Making contact tracing an ancillary, opt-in function might facilitate a wider acceptance of BFAs.","Ayres, I.; Romano, A.; Sotis, C.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.09.20191320v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.09.20191320,244

Asymptomatic shedding among pediatric surgery patients (PSPs) could potentially lead to progression of symptomatic diseases and cause outbreaks of respiratory diseases. The aim of this study is to investigate the incidence of infection among mild symptomatic PSP group and asymptomatic PSP group after surgical procedure. METHODS: We collected the induced sputum from enrolled 1629 children (under 18 years of age) with no respiratory symptom prior to pediatric surgery between March 2017 and February 2019. We tested 16 different respiratory virus infections in post-surgery mild symptomatic PSP group and asymptomatic PSP group using a quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay panel. We analyzed symptom data and quantitative viral load to investigate the association between viruses, symptoms and viral quantity in qRT-PCR-positive PSPs. RESULTS: Out of 1629 children enrolled, a total of 204 respiratory viruses were present in 171 (10.50%) PSPs including 47 patients with mild symptoms and 124 with no symptoms after surgery. Commonly detected viruses were human rhino/enterovirus (HRV/EV, 42.19%), parainfluenza virus 3 (PIV3, 24.48%), coronavirus (CoV NL63, OC43, HKU1, 11.46%), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, 9.9%). PIV3 infection with a higher viral load was frequently found in PSPs presenting with mild symptoms, progressing to pneumonia with radiographic evidence after surgery. HRV/EV were the most commonly detected pathogens in both asymptomatic and mild symptomatic PSPs. CoV (OC43, HKU1) infections with a higher viral load were mostly observed in asymptomatic PSPs progressing to alveolar or interstitial infiltration. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggested that PIV3 is a new risk factor for VRI in PSPs. Employing a more comprehensive, sensitive and quantitative method should be considered for preoperative testing of respiratory viruses in order to guide optimal surgical timing.","Zhang, Dan; Lou, Xiuyu; Yan, Hao; Pan, Junhang; Mao, Haiyan; Tang, Hongfeng; Shu, Yan; Zhao, Yun; Liu, Lei; Li, Junping; Chen, Dong; Zhang, Yanjun; Ma, Xuejun",Respir Res,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12931-019-1086-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31208426/,244

In this report, we document the chemical synthesis of IFTIM3 in multi‐milligram quantities (>15 mg) and the preparation of phosphorylated and fluorescent variants. The synthesis was accomplished by using KAHA ligations, which operate under acidic aqueous/organic mixtures that excel at solubilizing even the exceptionally hydrophobic C‐terminal region of IFITM3.

The pandemic caused by COVID-19 has opened new perspectives for the execution and advancement of cardiovascular tests through telemedicine platforms. Objective: This study aimed to analyze the usefulness of telemedical systems for providing personal care in the prevention of CVD. Methods: A systematic review analysis was conducted on the literature available from libraries such as PubMed (Medline), Scopus (Embase), and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL). Data available in the last 10 years (2011–2020) were also examined by PRISMA guidelines. The selected studies were divided into two categories: (1) benefits of telemedicine in CVD prevention, and (2) recent progress in telemedical services for personalized care of CVD. Results: The literature search produced 587 documents, and 19 articles were considered in this review. Results highlighted that the timely delivery of preventive care for CVD which can be implemented virtually can benefit and modify morbidity and mortality. This could also reduce the pressure on hospitals by decreasing acute CVD occurrence among the general population. The use of these technologies can also help to reduce access to hospitals and other medical devices when not necessary. Conclusions: Telemedicine platforms can be used for regular checkups for CVD and contribute to preventing the occurrence of acute events and more in general the progression of CVD.","Battineni, Gopi; Sagaro, Getu Gamo; Chintalapudi, Nalini; Amenta, Francesco",J Pers Med,https://doi.org/10.3390/jpm11070658; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34357125/,244

Here we propose an extended SEIR model to explore the dynamics of containment and then explore scenarios for the local extinction of the disease. We present both the deterministic and stochastic version fo the model and derive the R0 and the probability of local extinction after relaxation (elimination of transmission) of containment, P0. We show that local extinctions are possible without further interventions, with reasonable probability, as long as the number of active cases is driven to single digits and strict control of case importation is maintained. The maintenance of defensive behaviors, such as using masks and avoiding agglomerations are also important factors. We also explore the importance of population immunity even when above the herd immunity threshold.","Coelho, F. C.; Carvalho, L. M.; Lana, R. M.; Cruz, O. G.; Bastos, L. S.; Codeco, C. T.; Gomes, M.

Such frameshifting normally occurs at a set ratio and is utilized in the expression of many viral genes and a number of cellular genes. An open question is whether proteins might function as trans-acting switches to turn frameshifting on or off in response to cellular conditions. Here we show that frameshifting in a model RNA virus, encephalomyocarditis virus, is trans-activated by viral protein 2A. As a result, the frameshifting efficiency increases from 0 to 70% (one of the highest known in a mammalian system) over the course of infection, temporally regulating the expression levels of the viral structural and enzymatic proteins.","Napthine, Sawsan; Ling, Roger; Finch, Leanne K.; Jones, Joshua D.; Bell, Susanne; Brierley, Ian; Firth, Andrew E.",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28593994/; https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms15582,244

605330,Challenges in the management of critical ill COVID‐19 patients with pressure ulcer,2020-05-07,"BACKGROUND: Annually in the UK, 40,000–90,000 people are involved in a traumatic incident. Severity of injury and how well people recover from their injuries varies, with physiotherapy playing a key role in the rehabilitation process. Recovery is evaluated using multiple outcome measures for perceived levels of pain severity and quality of life. It is unclear however, what constitutes a successful recovery from injury throughout the course of recovery from the patient perspective, and whether this aligns with physiotherapists’ perspectives. METHODS: A qualitative study using two approaches: Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) using semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis following the Kreuger framework for focus groups. A purposive sample of 20 patients who have experienced musculoskeletal trauma within the past 4 weeks and 12 physiotherapists who manage this patient population will be recruited from a single trauma centre in the UK. Semi-structured interviews with patients at 4 weeks, 6 and 12 months following injury, and 2 focus groups with physiotherapists will be undertaken at one time point. Views and perceptions on the definition of recovery and what constitutes a successful recovery will be explored using both methods, with a focus on the lived experience and patient journey following musculoskeletal trauma, and how this changes through the process of recovery. Data from both the semi-structured interviews and focus groups will be analysed separately and then integrated and synthesised into key themes ensuring similarities and differences are identified. Strategies to ensure trustworthiness e.g., reflexivity will be employed. DISCUSSION: Recovery following musculoskeletal trauma is complex and understanding of the concept of successful recovery and how this changes over time following an injury is largely unknown. It is imperative to understand the patient perspective and whether these perceptions align with current views of physiotherapists. A greater understanding of recovery following musculoskeletal trauma has potential to change clinical care, optimise patient centred care and improve efficiency and clinical decision making during rehabilitation. This in turn can contribute to improved clinical effectiveness, patient outcome and patient satisfaction with potential service and economic cost savings.

Next, less common RNA modifications including m(5)C, Nm and ac(4)C were investigated and also found to be present on viral RNA. It now appears that viral RNA is littered with a multitude of RNA modifications. In biological systems that are under constant evolutionary pressure to out compete both the host as well as newly arising viral mutants, it poses an interesting question about what evolutionary benefit these modifications provide as it seems evident, at least to this author, that these modifications have been selected for. In this review, I discuss how RNA modifications are identified on viral RNA and the roles that have now been uncovered for these modifications in regard to viral replication. Finally, I propose some interesting avenues of research that may shed further light on the exact role that these modifications play in viral replication.","Courtney, David G.",Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34066974/; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells10051129,244

OBJECTIVES: Our retrospective study utilized respiratory pathogen panel (RPP) results in patients with SARS-CoV-2 to determine if coinfection (i.e. SARS-CoV-2 positivity with an additional respiratory virus) was associated with more severe presentation and outcomes. METHODS: All patients with negative influenza/respiratory syncytial virus testing who underwent RPP testing within 7 days of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test at a large, academic medical centre in New York were examined. Patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 with a negative RPP were compared with patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 and positive for a virus by RPP in terms of biomarkers, oxygen requirements and severe COVID-19 outcome, as defined by mechanical ventilation or death within 30 days. RESULTS: Of the 306 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients with RPP testing, 14 (4.6%) were positive for a non-influenza virus (coinfected). Compared with the coinfected group, patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 with a negative RPP had higher inflammatory markers and were significantly more likely to be admitted (P = 0.01). Severe COVID-19 outcome occurred in 111 (36.3%) patients in the SARS-CoV-2-only group and 3 (21.4%) patients in the coinfected group (P = 0.24). CONCLUSIONS: Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 along with a non-influenza respiratory virus had less severe disease on presentation and were more likely to be admitted—but did not have more severe outcomes—than those infected with SARS-CoV-2 alone.","Chekuri, Sweta; Szymczak, Wendy A; Goldstein, D Yitzchak; Nori, Priya; Marrero Rolon, Rebecca; Spund, Brian; Singh-Tan, Sumeet; Mohrmann, Laurel; Assa, Andrei; Southern, William N; Baron, Sarah W",J Antimicrob Chemother,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34555160/; https://doi.org/10.1093/jac/dkab244,244

This will provide useful information for planning and resource allocation in the event of any further lockdown. METHODS: A prospective analsysis of all patients attending our hand trauma unit throughout the UK COVID-19 lockdown period (24 March to 10 May 2020) was carried out. Prospectively collected departmental data from the same period in 2019 was obtained and reviewed for comparison. The number of patients attending clinic, undergoing surgery, the type of surgical procedure, and rate of surgery was compared. RESULTS: In all, 463 patients attended hand trauma services during the lockdown period compared to 793 in 2019 (32% reduction); 190 surgical procedures were carried out during lockdown compared to 236 in 2019 (20% reduction). Intervention rate was higher during the lockdown period (41% compared to 30%). There was no difference in the type of cases. In the first half of lockdown, 47% fewer procedures were performed than in 2019, but in the second half of lockdown 13% more procedures were carried out than the same period in 2019. CONCLUSION: Requirements for hand trauma surgery remain high during a pandemic lockdown. Attendances and surgical requirements can be expected to steadily return to normal levels during a prolonged lockdown period. Throughout any future lockdown period adequate surgical provision must be maintained for patients with hand injuries.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively included 60 consecutive patients (mean age, 61 ± 12 years; 18 females) with proven COVID-19 infection undergoing chest CT between March and May 2020. Clinical and laboratory data (within 24 hours before/after chest CT) were recorded. Prototype software using a deep learning algorithm was applied for automatic segmentation and quantification of lung opacities. Percentage of opacity (PO, ground-glass and consolidations) and percentage of high opacity (PHO, consolidations), were defined as 100 times the volume of segmented abnormalities divided by the volume of the lung mask. RESULTS: Automatic CT analysis of the lung was feasible in all patients (n = 60). The median time to accomplish automatic evaluation was 120 s (IQR: 118–128 s). In four cases (7%), manual corrections were necessary. Patients with need for mechanical ventilation had a significantly higher PO (median 44%, IQR: 23-58% versus 13%, IQR: 10-24%; p = 0.001) and PHO (median: 11%, IQR: 6-21% versus 3%, IQR: 2-7%, p = 0.002) compared to those without. The PO and PHO moderately correlated with c-reactive protein (r = 0.49-0.60, both p < 0.001) and leucocyte count (r = 0.30-0.40, both p = 0.05). PO had a negative correlation with SO(2) (r=-0.50, p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Preliminary experience indicates the feasibility of a rapid, automatic quantification tool of lung parenchymal abnormalities in COVID-19 patients using deep learning, with results correlating with laboratory and clinical parameters.","Mergen, Victor; Kobe, Adrian; Blüthgen, Christian; Euler, André; Flohr, Thomas; Frauenfelder, Thomas; Alkadhi, Hatem; Eberhard, Matthias",Eur J Radiol Open,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352047720300617; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejro.2020.100272; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33043101/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352047720300617?v=s5,244
609603,2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19): Paving the Road for Rapid Detection and Point-of-Care Diagnostics,2020-03-14,"As the number of confirmed cases of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to increase, there has been a rising concern regarding the effect of weather conditions, especially over the upcoming summer, on the transmission of this disease. In this study, we assess the transmission of COVID-19 under different weather conditions by investigating the propagation of infectious respiratory droplets. A comprehensive mathematical model is established to explore their evaporation, heat transfer and kinematics under different temperature, humidity and ventilation conditions. The transmitting pathway of COVID-19 through respiratory droplets is divided into short-range droplet contacts and long-range aerosol exposure. We show that the effect of weather conditions is not monotonic: low temperature and high humidity facilitate droplet contact transmission, while high temperature and low humidity promote the formation of aerosol particles and accumulation of particles with a diameter of 2.5 m or less (PM2.5). Our model suggests that the 6 ft of social distance recommended by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) may be insufficient in certain environmental conditions, as the droplet spreading distance can be as long as 6 m (19.7 ft) in cold and humid weather. The results of this study suggest that the current pandemic may not ebb in the summer of the northern hemisphere without proper intervention, as there is an increasing chance of aerosol transmission. We also emphasize that the meticulous design of building ventilation systems is critical in containing both the droplet contact infections and aerosol exposures.","Zhao, L.; Qi, Y.; Luzzatto-Fegiz, P.; Cui, Y.; Zhu, Y.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.24.20111963; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.24.20111963v1?rss=1,244

METHODS: A pilot cohort of 91 patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection from the Northeastern United States was analyzed to characterize patient risk factors and factors associated with an increased severity of COVID-19 infection. Univariate analysis of variance was performed using the Mann-Whitney U test or analysis of variance for continuous variables and the χ(2) or Fisher exact test for nominal variables. Univariate and stepwise multivariate logistic regression identified clinical characteristics or symptoms associated with hospitalization. RESULTS: Our cohort demonstrated a 27.5% hospitalization rate and a 4.4% case fatality rate. Performance on Timed 25-Foot Walk before COVID-19 infection, age, number of comorbidities, and presenting symptoms of nausea/vomiting and neurologic symptoms (e.g., paresthesia or weakness) were independent risk factors for hospitalization, whereas headache predicted a milder course without hospitalization. An absolute lymphocyte count was lower in hospitalized patients during COVID-19 infection. Use of disease-modifying therapy did not increase the risk of hospitalization but was associated with an increased need for respiratory support. DISCUSSION: The case fatality and hospitalization rates in our cohort were similar to those found in MS and general population COVID-19 cohorts within the region. Hospitalization was associated with increased disability, age, and comorbidities but not disease-modifying therapy use.","Money, Kelli M.; Mahatoo, Ashmanie; Samaan, Soleil; Anand, Pria; Baber, Ursela; Bailey, Mary; Bakshi, Rohit; Bouley, Andrew; Bower, Aaron; Cahill, Jonathan; Houtchens, Maria; Katz, Joshua; Lathi, Ellen; Levit, Elle; Longbrake, Erin E.; McAdams, Matthew; Napoli, Salvatore; Raibagkar, Pooja; Wade, Peter; Sloane, Jacob A.",Neurol Neuroimmunol Neuroinflamm,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34341094/; https://doi.org/10.1212/nxi.0000000000001046,244

Daily increase in cases of COVID-19 patients worldwide and limited number of available detection kits pose difficulty in identifying the presence of disease. Therefore, at this point of time, necessity arises to look for other alternatives. Among already existing, widely available and low-cost resources, X-ray is frequently used imaging modality and on the other hand, deep learning techniques have achieved state-of-the-art performances in computer-aided medical diagnosis. Therefore, an alternative diagnostic tool to detect COVID-19 cases utilizing available resources and advanced deep learning techniques is proposed in this work. The proposed method is implemented in four phases, viz., data augmentation, preprocessing, stage-I and stage-II deep network model designing. This study is performed with online available resources of 1215 images and further strengthen by utilizing data augmentation techniques to provide better generalization of the model and to prevent the model overfitting by increasing the overall length of dataset to 1832 images. Deep network implementation in two stages is designed to differentiate COVID-19 induced pneumonia from healthy cases, bacterial and other virus induced pneumonia on X-ray images of chest. Comprehensive evaluations have been performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method with both (i) training-validation-testing and (ii) 5-fold cross validation procedures. High classification accuracy as 97.77%, recall as 97.14% and precision as 97.14% in case of COVID-19 detection shows the efficacy of proposed method in present need of time. Further, the deep network architecture showing averaged accuracy/sensitivity/specificity/precision/F1-score of 98.93/98.93/98.66/96.39/98.15 with 5-fold cross validation makes a promising outcome in COVID-19 detection using X-ray images.","Jain, Govardhan; Mittal, Deepti; Thakur, Daksh; Mittal, Madhup K.",Biocybern Biomed Eng,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32921862/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0208521620301005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0208521620301005; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbe.2020.08.008,244

We show that human in vitro differentiated myeloid dendritic cells (mDC) as well as M1 and M2 macrophages are susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2 but are not productively infected. Furthermore, infected mDC, M1-, and M2 macrophages show only slight changes in their activation status. Surprisingly, none of the infected innate immune cells produced the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)−6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, or interferon (IFN)−α. Moreover, even in co-infection experiments using different stimuli, as well as non-influenza (non-flu) or influenza A (flu) viruses, only very minor IL-6 production was induced.

We searched PubMed for relevant articles and discussed the results separately for three categories: disease mapping, exposure mapping, and spatial epidemiological modeling. The majority of studies were ecological in nature and primarily carried out in China, Brazil, and the USA. The most common spatial methods used were clustering, hotspot analysis, space-time scan statistic, and regression modeling. Researchers used a wide range of spatial and statistical software to apply spatial analysis for the purpose of disease mapping, exposure mapping, and epidemiological modeling. Factors limiting the use of these spatial techniques were the unavailability and bias of COVID-19 data—along with scarcity of fine-scaled demographic, environmental, and socio-economic data—which restrained most of the researchers from exploring causal relationships of potential influencing factors of COVID-19. Our review identified geospatial analysis in COVID-19 research and highlighted current trends and research gaps.

PURPOSE: In a recent issue published in the European Archives of Otorhinolaryngology, Mattioli et al. published a short communication about tracheostomy timing in patients with COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019); they reported that the tracheostomy could allow early Intensive Care Units discharge and, in the context of prolonged Invasive Mechanical Ventilation, should be suggested within 7 and 14 days to avoid potential tracheal damages. In this Letter to the Editor we would like to present our experience with tracheostomy in a Hub Covid Hospital. METHODS: 8 patients underwent open tracheostomy in case of intubation prolonged over 14 days, bronchopulmonary overlap infections, and patients undergoing weaning. They were followed up and the number and timing of death were recorded. RESULTS: Two patients died after tracheostomy; the median time between tracheostomy and death was 3 days. A negative prognostic trend was observed for a shorter duration of intubation. CONCLUSION: In our experience, tracheostomy does not seem to influence the clinical course and prognosis of the disease, in the face of possible risks of contagion for healthcare workers. The indication for tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients should be carefully evaluated and reserved for selected patients. Although it is not possible to define an optimal timing, it is our opinion that tracheostomy in a stable or clinically improved COVID-19 patient should not be proposed before the 20th day after orotracheal intubation.","Ferri, Emanuele; Boscolo Nata, Francesca; Pedruzzi, Barbara; Campolieti, Giovanni; Scotto di Clemente, Francesco; Baratto, Fabio; Cristalli, Giovanni",Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32458121/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00405-020-06068-7,244
612257,National case fatality rates of the COVID-19 pandemic,2020-09-23,"The etiology of most neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system remains unknown and likely involves a combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental triggering factors. Given that exposure to numerous infectious pathogens occurs during childhood, and that some viral infections can lead to neurodegeneration and demyelination, it is conceivable that some viruses may act as triggering factors in neuropathogenesis. We have previously shown that the prototype OC43 strain of the common cold—associated human respiratory coronavirus has the capacity to infect human neuronal and glial cells and does persist in human brains. Moreover, it has neuroinvasive properties in susceptible BALB/c mice, where it leads to a chronic encephalitis with accompanying disabilities. Here, we show that mutations in the viral spike glycoprotein, reproducibly acquired during viral persistence in human neural cell cultures, led to a drastically modified virus-induced neuropathology in BALB/c mice, characterized by flaccid paralysis and demyelination. Even though infection by both mutated and wild-type viruses led to neuroinflammation, the modified neuropathogenesis induced by the mutated virus was associated with increased viral spread and significantly more CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocyte infiltration into the central nervous system, as well as significantly increased levels of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-6 and the chemokine CCL2 (monocyte chemoattractant protein [MCP]-1). Moreover, recombinant virus harboring the S glycoprotein mutations retained its neurotropism, productively infecting neurons. Therefore, interaction of a human respiratory coronavirus with the central nervous system may modulate virus and host factors resulting in a modified neuropathogenesis in genetically susceptible individuals.","Jacomy, Hélène; St-Jean, Julien R.; Brison, Élodie; Marceau, Gabriel; Desforges, Marc; Talbot, Pierre J.",J Neurovirol,https://doi.org/10.3109/13550284.2010.497806; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20642316/,244

In order to reduce morbidity and mortality caused by this agent, pneumococcal vaccines have been developed over the years and have shown incredible effectiveness in reducing the spread of this bacterium and the development of related diseases, obtaining a significant reduction in mortality, especially in developing countries. However, considerable problems are emerging mainly due to the replacement phenomenon, multi-drug resistance, and the high production costs of conjugated vaccines. There is still a debate about the indications given by various countries to different age groups; this is one of the reasons for the diffusion of different serotypes. To cope with these problems, significant efforts have been made in the research field to further improve vaccination serotypes coverage.

Weaning occurred when daily starter intake over 7 consecutive days averaged 0.5 kg. Maximum starter intake was restricted to 3 kg day−1, and grass hay was fed ad libitum.

Groups 2 and 3 were supplemented with either 2 g purified immunoglobulins (Ig) or 25-ml pooled colostrum (CO) twice daily, via the milk replacer as used in Group 1. Neither Ig nor CO exerted a positive effect on growth rate and feed efficiency. Six calves died: two, one and three in Groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Their serum IG content was significantly lower than that of the surviving animals. Mechanisms explaining the lack of any protective effect are discussed.

We set out to characterize US MD and DO Senior residency match performance in the single-accreditation GME era. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted in 2021 utilizing data collected from the 2018 and 2020 NRMP Charting Outcomes in the Match publications aggregated and subdivided into three groups based on competitiveness: low (LC), moderate (MC), and high (HC). Nonparametric analysis was performed using Chi square or Fisher exact tests if counts were less than five. Significance was determined at p < 0.05. Results: A total of 46,853 candidates were included, with 36,194 (77.3%) US MD and 10,659 (22.7%) DO Seniors. Match rates for US DO Seniors were lower than US MD Seniors across all competitiveness strata (p < 0.0001). Research item production, national licensing examination scores, and mean number of contiguous programs ranked were lower for matched US DO Seniors compared to matched US MD Seniors, with significant differences depending on competitiveness group. Conclusions: With recent changes to GME and its application process, understanding how various groups compare will be increasingly important. US DO Seniors have lower first-rank match rates for all specialty competitiveness levels. This may be due to lower research output or nuanced specialty selection.

Process quality control of its ethanol precipitation is a topical issue in the pharmaceutical field. Near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is commonly used for process quality analysis. However, establishing a robust and reliable quantitative model of complex process remains a challenge in industrial applications of NIR. In this paper, modeling design based on quality by design concept (QbD) was implemented for the ethanol precipitation process quality control of Honeysuckle flower. According to the 56 models' performances and 25 contour plots, quadratic model was the best with R(adj)(2) increasing from 0.1395 to 0.9085, indicating the strong interaction among spectral pre-processing methods, variable selection methods, and latent factors. SG9 and CARS was an appropriate combination for modeling. Furthermore, spectral assignment method was creatively introduced for variable selection. Another 56 models' performances and 25 contour plots were established. Compared with the chemometric variable selection method, spectral assignment combined with QbD concept made a higher R(pre)(2) and a lower RMSEP. When the latent factors of PLS was small, R(pre)(2) of the model by spectral assignment increased from 0.9605 to 0.9916 and RMSEP decreased from 0.1555 mg/mL to 0.07134 mg/mL. This result suggests that the variable selected by spectral assignment is more representative and precise. This provided a novel modeling guideline for process quality control in PAT.","Ma, Lijuan; Liu, Daihan; Du, Chenzhao; Lin, Ling; Zhu, Jinyuan; Huang, Xingguo; Liao, Yuan; Wu, Zhisheng",Spectrochim Acta A Mol Biomol Spectrosc,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.saa.2020.118740; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32736221/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386142520307198?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386142520307198,244

This study aims to summarize the latest evidence on whether the use of corticosteroids in patients with myocarditis associated with COVID-19 is necessary. METHODS: We performed an extensive search using a combination of search terms in PubMed, Europe PMC, ProQuest, EBSCOhost, and Google Scholar up to January 2021. Full-text articles that met the predefined inclusion criteria were included in the present study. RESULTS: The full-texts of 18 articles have been reviewed. Thirteen out of the eighteen (72%) patients who got corticosteroid administration experienced major clinical improvements during follow-up while the other five (28%) were experiencing uneventful events. The mean age of the reported patients was 47.8±13.2 years. There was no gender predominance. Most of the reported cases were from USA (39%) followed by Spain, China, and UK (11% each), while Brazil, Colombia, France, Belgium, and Italy contributed one case each. Various corticosteroids were used but the most commonly applied were methylprednisolone (89%), hydrocortisone (5.5%), and prednisolone (5.5%). The most common route of administration among the studies was intravenous administration and the duration of treatment varied between one and fourteen days. CONCLUSION: A review of the currently available literature shows that with the use of corticosteroid agents in treating myocarditis associated with COVID-19, favorable outcomes are attainable. Well-established randomized clinical trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of using corticosteroids in this condition.","Kamarullah, William; Nurcahyani,; Mary Josephine, Claudia; Bill Multazam, Rachmatu; Ghaezany Nawing, Aqila",Arch Acad Emerg Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34027427/; https://doi.org/10.22037/aaem.v9i1.1153,244

Here we show that s2m is evolutionarily conserved in these viruses. Though several lineages of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) devoid of the element can be found, these variants seem to have been short lived, indicating that they were less evolutionary fit than their s2m-containing counterparts. On a species-level, however, there do not appear to be any losses and this pattern strongly suggests that the s2m element is essential to virus replication in SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses.

However, data on the viral loads in such individuals are lacking. We assessed the viral loads in asymptomatic individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection in comparison with those in symptomatic patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Study participants were recruited from a community facility designated for the isolation of patients with mild COVID-19 in South Korea. The presence of symptoms was evaluated with a questionnaire-based survey. Viral loads in the upper respiratory tract were measured with real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) targeting the E, RdRp and N genes of SARS-CoV-2, with a cycle threshold (Ct) value of 40 for determining positivity. RESULTS: In 213 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 41 (19%) had remained asymptomatic from potential exposure to laboratory confirmation and admission; of them, 39 (95%) underwent follow-up RT-PCR testing after a median 13 days. In 172 symptomatic patients, 144 (84%) underwent follow-up RT-PCR testing. Twenty-one (54%) asymptomatic individuals and 92 (64%) symptomatic patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at follow-up. Asymptomatic individuals and symptomatic patients did not show any significant differences in the mean Ct values of the E (31.15 vs 31.43; p>0.99), RdRp (32.26 vs 32.93; p=0.92) and N (33.05 vs 33.28; p>0.99) genes. CONCLUSION: Approximately one-fifth of the individuals without severe symptoms were asymptomatic, and their viral loads were comparable to those in symptomatic patients.

Of the 96 clones isolated from the SSH library, 28 unique expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were obtained, of which eight were confirmed to be slightly but significantly (P < 0.05) more up-regulated by the re-infection at 6 h post infection (hpi). Expression kinetics studies at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hpi revealed that the eight ESTs were significantly (P = 0.016) more up-regulated by the first infection, with a major peak at 3 hpi. A total of 96 genes reported in literature to be up-regulated by bacterial infections were selected and subjected to expression analysis at 3 hpi. Of the 96 selected genes, 19 were found to be significantly (P < 0.05) induced by A. hydrophila after the first infection and the re-infection. The 19 genes belonged to the following five main categories: 1) toll-like receptor (TLR2, TLR3, TLR5, TLR21); 2) antimicrobial peptide (NK-lysin type 1, NK-lysin type 2, NK-lysin type 3, cathepsin D, transferrin, hepcidin); 3) cytokine or chemokine (interleukin-1β, interleukin-10, tumor necrosis factor α, chemokine CXCL-10); 4) signaling proteins (cadherin EGF LAG seven-pass G-type receptor 1, very large inducible GTPase 1, arginine deiminase type 2, lymphokine-activated killer T-cell originated protein kinase); 5) lysozyme (lysozyme c). Overall, the total 27 genes (8 ESTs plus the 19 selected genes) were significantly (P < 0.001) more induced by the first infection. Peaked expression of lysozyme c and serum lysozyme activity after the first infection were seen at 24 hpi, whereas that after the re-infection were seen at 12 hpi, suggesting that both innate and adaptive immunity were involved in the defense against the re-infection of A. hydrophila.","Mu, Xingjiang; Pridgeon, Julia W.; Klesius, Phillip H.",Fish Shellfish Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24036330/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1050464813007419; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1050464813007419; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2013.08.027,244

CLD granules have been used for the treatment of inflammatory conditions and feverish diseases in China, including seasonal influenza, but few evidence-based medicine (EBM) clinical studies have been conducted to assess its efficacy and safety in the treatment of influenza. Here, we performed an EBM clinical trial combining Western Chinese medicine and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) evaluation systems to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CLD granules in the treatment of seasonal influenza. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study is designed as a multicentre, randomised, double-blinded, double-simulation, oseltamivir-controlled and placebo-controlled, parallel-design clinical trial. Eligible subjects (n=318) will be allocated after satisfying the criteria (Western medicine). Subjects will be randomised to receive CLD granules, oseltamivir, or a placebo for 5 days of treatment and with follow-up after treatment to record symptoms and signs and to collect pharyngeal/throat swabs and serum samples for detecting the virus and antibodies. At the same time, the syndrome differentiation criteria of TCM, such as tongue body, furred tongue and type of pulse, will be recorded as determined by doctors of both Western and Chinese medicine. Participants will be instructed to comply with the protocol and to keep a daily record of symptoms. The primary and secondary outcomes and safety indicators will be used to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CLD granules in the treatment of seasonal influenza based on both Western Chinese medicine and TCM evaluation systems. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The CLD granules clinical trial will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice and has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University. All participants must provide written informed consent. The results obtained will be disseminated at international medical conferences and in peer-reviewed publications.

Thromboembolic events as well as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) are the major causes of death in this continued pandemic. While elevated D-dimer level suggests worse thrombotic outcomes, levels at which benefits of anticoagulation outweigh the bleeding risk is yet to be determined. In this report, we present a case of a 72-year-old man with COVID-19 presented with confusion and subsequently developed acute hypoxic respiratory failure. On hospital day 7, patient developed extensive peripheral arterial thrombosis with acute rise of D-dimer from 800 to 14,899 ng/ml. He was treated with heparin drip and underwent urgent brachial, radial and ulnar embolectomy under general anesthesia.

To investigate the epidemic characteristics of PEDV, the complete ORF3 genes of 14 PEDV field strains from central China during 2012 to 2013 were cloned, sequenced and compared with reference strains. Phylogenetic analysis based on the complete ORF3 gene showed that the PEDVs in central China and the reference strains could be divided into three groups: G1, G2, and G3. The 14 PEDV isolates were classified as G1 and showed a close relationship to some Chinese strains isolated previously in central China and differed genetically from recent isolates from southern China, Korean strains (SM98 and DB1865, 2012), the Chinese LZC strain (2007), and the vaccine strain (CV777) being used in China. Our findings suggested that the PEDVs circulating between 2012 and 2013 in central China might have evolved from earlier strains in the local region. To determine the reason for recent vaccination failures, we also studied variations in antigenicity of field strains by analyzing the three neutralizing epitope regions in the S gene. The results showed that the neutralizing epitopes at aa 245-252 were highly conserved, but most of the amino acid changes occurred in the epitope regions aa 7-146 and 271-278. We speculate that the amino acid mutations in the neutralizing epitope regions may be associated with changes in the antigenicity of PEDV and consequently result in vaccination failure. Together, these findings may be useful for understanding the epidemiology of PEDV and may be relevant for designing of new and more efficacious vaccines.","Li, Renfeng; Qiao, Songlin; Yang, Yanyan; Su, Yunfang; Zhao, Pu; Zhou, Enmin; Zhang, Gaiping",Arch Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24292967/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-013-1929-7,244

The geographical distribution of air pollution and Covid-19 mortality in Italy suggested atmospheric pollution as a worsening factor of severe Covid-19 health outcomes. The present nationwide ecological study focused on all 107 Italian territorial areas, aiming to assess the potential association between Particulate Matter concentration, less than 2.5 μm in diameter (exposure), and Covid-19 mortality rate (outcome) throughout 2020, by looking at 28 potential confounders. A potential positive association between exposure and outcome was observed when performing a multivariate regression analysis with a Negative Binomial model, suggesting that an increase of 1 μg/m(3) in the exposure is associated with an increase of 9.0% (95% CI: 6.5%–11.6%) in the average Covid-19 mortality rate, conditional on all 28 potential confounders. A sensitivity analysis, based on the E-value, shows that a hypothetical unmeasured confounder would have to be associated with both PM(2.5) concentration and Covid-19 mortality rate by a rate ratio of at least 1.40-fold each to explain away the exposure-outcome association, conditional on all 28 covariates included in the main analysis model. Moreover, the Observed Covariate E-value (OCE) was reported to provide a contextualization of the E-value on the observed covariates included in the study. The OCE sensitivity analysis shows that a set of unknown confounders similar in size and magnitude to the set of the considered climatic factors could potentially explain away the estimated exposure-outcome association. Consequently, the role of climatic factors in the Covid-19 pandemic is worth of further investigation.","Aloisi, Valeria; Gatto, Andrea; Accarino, Gabriele; Donato, Francesco; Aloisio, Giovanni",Environ Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34619131/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0013935121014328; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.112131; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935121014328?v=s5,244

The Asian National Cancer Centres Alliance and the Asia-Pacific Organisation for Cancer Prevention collaborated to assess the mid- and long- term impact of COVID-19 to cancer care in Asia. METHODS: The two entities organised a combined symposium and post-meeting interactions among representatives of major cancer centres from seventeen Asian countries to outlining major challenges and countermeasures. RESULTS: Participating stakeholders distilled five big questions. 1) “Will there be an explosion of late-stage cancers after the pandemic?” To address and recover from perceived delayed prevention, screening, treatment and care challenges, collaboration of key stakeholders in the region and alignment in cancer care management, policy intervention and cancer registry initiatives would be of essential value. 2) “Operations and Finance” The pandemic has resulted in significant material and financial casualties. Flagged acute challenges (shortages of supplies, imposition of lockdown) as well as longer-standing reduction of financial revenue, manpower, international collaboration, and training should also be addressed. 3) “Will telemedicine and technological innovations revolutionize cancer care?” Deploying and implementing telemedicine such as teleconsultation and virtual tumour boards were considered invaluable. These innovations could become a new regular practice, leading to expansion of tele-collaboration through collaboration of institutions in the region. 4) “Will virtual conferences continue after the pandemic?” Virtual conferences during the pandemic have opened new doors for knowledge sharing, especially for representatives of low- and middle-income countries in the region, while saving time and costs of travel. 5) “How do we prepare for the next pandemic or international emergency?” Roadmaps for action to improve access to appropriate patient care and research were identified and scrutinised. CONCLUSION: Through addressing these five big questions, focused collaboration among members and with international organisations such as City Cancer Challenge will allow enhanced preparedness for future international emergencies.","Gatellier, Laureline; Shankar, Abhishek; Dewi, Luh K Mela; Hussain, Quazi Mushtaq; Wangdi, Tashi Dendup; Sukumaran, Dato Babu; Kemala Sari, Nina Kemala; Tavakkoli Shiraji, Sahar; Biglari, Mohammad; Tahmasebi, Mamak; Iwata, Satoshi; Suzuki, Tatsuya; Myung, Seung-Kwon; Chun, June Young; Han, Jong Soo; Lau, Fen Nee; Yusak, Suhana; Bayarsaikhan, Luvsandorj; Mu, Khin Thin; Pradhananga, Kishore K.; Yusuf, Aasim; Lin, Ching-Hung; Chiang, Ruru Chun-Ju; Sangrajran, Suleeporn; Nguyen, Quang Tien; Huong, Giang Nguyen; Soe, Aung Naing; Sharma, D N; Sengar, Manju; Pramesh, C S; Matsuda, Tomohiro; Mosavi jarrahi, Alireza; Hwang, William",Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,https://doi.org/10.31557/apjcp.2021.22.3.681; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33773529/,244
617551,A Quality Improvement Intervention to Enhance Access to Kidney Transplantation and Living Kidney Donation (EnAKT LKD) in Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease: Clinical Research Protocol of a Cluster-Randomized Clinical Trial,2021-04-15,"Introduction: At present, the COVID-19 pandemic remains the most pressing global health issue. Given the significant amount of public awareness, the infection rate and rehabilitation efforts are governed not only by the compliance of transmission mitigation strategies but also by the understanding of coexisting diseases and COVID-19 in patients with chronic infectious diseases. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the differences in demographics, as well as awareness, risk perception, and emotional reactions, among imprisoned drug addicts with and without tuberculosis (TB) regarding their perceptions of and feelings toward the COVID-19 pandemic. The secondary goal of the study was also to measure how the psychological health and nutritional indices of the drug addicts with TB changed during their ongoing rehabilitation. Methods: A total of 265 male drug addicts, 45 of which were positive for TB and another 220 who were negative, were selected as subjects from a mandatory detoxification and rehabilitation center (MDRC). Data were collected through a combination of questionnaires (questions regarding COVID-19 awareness, emotional knowledge and responses, and SCL-90 tests), anthropometric examination, and laboratory blood tests, with which inferential and descriptive statistical analyses were performed. Results: During a period of 1 week in early 2021, the differences in the accuracy of the responses from the questions probing the awareness of COVID-19 symptoms, transmission, susceptible populations, what kind of mask should be worn, and preventive measures between TB addicts to non-TB addicts were 11.11 vs. 60.45%, 57.78 vs. 77.27%, 66.67 vs. 78.64%, 97.98 vs. 97.73%, and 93.33 vs. 65.91%, respectively. In the risk perception and emotional reaction sections of the questionnaire, there was a significant difference in the responses to “What you were more worried about was?” (p < 0.001) and “Alteration in your mood since the outbreak?” (p = 0.002) between the two cohorts. In the section assessing the 10 dimensions of the SCL-90 scale, there were significant differences between the TB addicts and the Chinese norm. In addition, the BMI (21.06 ± 2.65 kg/m(2)) and total serum protein (77.14 ± 6.12 g/L) levels of the TB addicts were normal, but the serum hemoglobin (117.02 ± 4.97 g/L) and albumin (42.08 ± 1.81 g/L) levels were significantly lower in the TB addicts compared to the norm (p < 0.001). Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic we are facing is both an epidemiologic and a psychological crisis. However, while the COVID-19 epidemic will eventually disappear (or become manageable, similar to the flu), the TB epidemic may still persist. To avoid the deleterious consequences of multiple simultaneous epidemics, complementary response measures to COVID-19 and TB can help curb the exacerbation of both situations and, therefore, save lives. Imprisoned drug addicts, especially those with TB, can master relevant knowledge on COVID-19.","Jia, Dongming; Li, Hai; Xu, Yuming",Front Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34483992/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.697508,244

Here, we studied the contribution of these domains to HCV susceptibility of hepatoma cells by generating chimeras of related tetraspanins with the hCD81 LEL. Our results show that non-LEL regions in addition to the LEL determine susceptibility of cells to HCV. While closely related tetraspanins (X. tropicalis CD81 and D. rerio CD81) functionally complement hCD81 non-LEL regions, distantly related tetraspanins (C. elegans TSP9 amd D. melanogaster TSP96F) do not and tetraspanins with intermediate homology (hCD9) show an intermediate phenotype. Tetraspanin homology and susceptibility to HCV correlate positively. For some chimeras, infectivity correlates with surface expression. In contrast, the hCD9 chimera is fully surface expressed, binds HCV E2 glycoprotein but is impaired in HCV receptor function. We demonstrate that a cholesterol-coordinating glutamate residue in CD81, which hCD9 lacks, promotes HCV infection. This work highlights the hCD81 non-LEL regions as additional HCV susceptibility-determining factors.","Banse, Pia; Moeller, Rebecca; Bruening, Janina; Lasswitz, Lisa; Kahl, Sina; Khan, Abdul G.; Marcotrigiano, Joseph; Pietschmann, Thomas; Gerold, Gisa",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29677132/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v10040207,244
619986,"Use of the Donabedian Model as a Framework for COVID-19 Response at a Hospital in Suburban Westchester County, New York: A Facility-level Case Report",2020-12-11,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak has now become a pandemic and has had a serious adverse impact on global public health. The effect of COVID-19 on the lungs can be determined through 2D computed tomography (CT) imaging, which requires a high level of spatial imagination on the part of the medical provider. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to determine whether viewing a 3D hologram with mixed reality techniques can improve medical professionals’ understanding of the pulmonary lesions caused by COVID-19. METHODS: The study involved 60 participants, including 20 radiologists, 20 surgeons, and 20 medical students. Each of the three groups was randomly divided into two groups, either the 2D CT group (n=30; mean age 29 years [range 19-38 years]; males=20) or the 3D holographic group (n=30; mean age 30 years [range 20=38 years]; males=20). The two groups completed the same task, which involved identifying lung lesions caused by COVID-19 for 6 cases using a 2D CT or 3D hologram. Finally, an independent radiology professor rated the participants' performance (out of 100). All participants in two groups completed a Likert scale questionnaire regarding the educational utility and efficiency of 3D holograms. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) was completed by all participants. RESULTS: The mean task score of the 3D hologram group (mean 91.98, SD 2.45) was significantly higher than that of the 2D CT group (mean 74.09, SD 7.59; P<.001). With the help of 3D holograms, surgeons and medical students achieved the same score as radiologists and made obvious progress in identifying pulmonary lesions caused by COVID-19. The Likert scale questionnaire results showed that the 3D hologram group had superior results compared to the 2D CT group (teaching: 2D CT group median 2, IQR 1-2 versus 3D group median 5, IQR 5-5; P<.001; understanding and communicating: 2D CT group median 1, IQR 1-1 versus 3D group median 5, IQR 5-5; P<.001; increasing interest: 2D CT group median 2, IQR 2-2 versus 3D group median 5, IQR 5-5; P<.001; lowering the learning curve: 2D CT group median 2, IQR 1-2 versus 3D group median 4, IQR 4-5; P<.001; spatial awareness: 2D CT group median 2, IQR 1-2 versus 3D group median 5, IQR 5-5; P<.001; learning: 2D CT group median 3, IQR 2-3 versus 3D group median 5, IQR 5-5; P<.001). The 3D group scored significantly lower than the 2D CT group for the “mental,” “temporal,” “performance,” and “frustration” subscales on the NASA-TLX. CONCLUSIONS: A 3D hologram with mixed reality techniques can be used to help medical professionals, especially medical students and newly hired doctors, better identify pulmonary lesions caused by COVID-19. It can be used in medical education to improve spatial awareness, increase interest, improve understandability, and lower the learning curve.

In the current study, we used the rS-AD as an immobilized target to identify peptides from a phage-display library with application for diagnosis. Among the 9 phages selected that specifically bound to rS-AD, the phage bearing the peptide TLNMHLFPFHTG bound with the highest affinity and was subsequently used to develop a phage-based ELISA for TGEV. When compared with conventional antibody-based ELISA, phage-mediated ELISA was more sensitive; however, it did not perform better than semi-quantitative RT-PCR, though phage-mediated ELISA was quicker and easier to set up.","Suo, Siqingaowa; Wang, Xue; Zarlenga, Dante; Bu, Ri-e; Ren, Yudong; Ren, Xiaofeng",Virus Genes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26013256/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11262-015-1208-7,244

With the aim to contribute to fill this diagnostic gap, a total of 61 effusions from cats with suspected effusive FIP were collected intra-vitam for detection of feline coronavirus (FCoV) antibodies and RNA by means of indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) assay and real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), respectively. In 5 effusions there was no evidence for either FCoV RNA or antibodies, 51 and 52 specimens tested positive by IIF and qRT-PCR, respectively, although antibody titres ≥ 1:1600, which are considered highly suggestive of FIP, were detected only in 37 effusions. Three samples with high antibody levels tested negative by qRT-PCR, whereas 18 qRT-PCR positive effusions contained no or low-titre antibodies. qRT-PCR positive samples with low antibody titres mostly contained low FCoV RNA loads, although the highest antibody titres were detected in effusions with C(T) values > 30. In conclusion, combining the two methods, i.e., antibody and RNA detection would help improving the intra-vitam diagnosis of effusive FIP.","Lorusso, Eleonora; Mari, Viviana; Losurdo, Michele; Lanave, Gianvito; Trotta, Adriana; Dowgier, Giulia; Colaianni, Maria Loredana; Zatelli, Andrea; Elia, Gabriella; Buonavoglia, Domenico; Decaro, Nicola",Res Vet Sci,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0034528817306495; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2017.10.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034528817306495; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29113645/,244

For this reason, on March 25, preventive isolation was declared mandatory. These measures involved the suspension of economic activities and drastically reduced the number of vehicles on the road. The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of the lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic on PM(2.5) concentrations at 5 monitoring stations and aerosol optical depth values of the Terra/MODIS satellite. We analyzed and compared the weekly and monthly concentrations of PM(2.5) before and during the lockdown between the week of January 6 to June 22, 2020, and compared the daily values obtained from the Terra/MODIS satellite for the months of January–June during the years 2018–2020 to elucidate the effects of the lockdown. Similar to other monitored sites in the world, we observed substantial reductions in weekly PM(2.5) concentrations, from 41 to 84% (Bogotá), from 13 to 66% (Funza), from 17 to 57% (Boyacá), from 35 to 86% (Valledupar) and 31 at 60% (Risaralda). Unlike other studies, the aerosol optical depth values increased up to 59% during the months of lockdown compared to previous years and up to 70% of the weekly mean when compared to before the lockdown. These spatiotemporal behaviors of PM(2.5) and the aerosol optical depth in Colombia are influenced by reductions in vehicular flow during quarantine, regional rainfall, and height of the planetary boundary layer. Emissions from economic activities affect pollutant levels in the area. The analysis of the levels of pollutants during the lockdown provides a baseline for regulatory agencies to establish mitigation plans.","Arregocés, Heli A.; Rojano, Roberto; Restrepo, Gloria",Sci Total Environ,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720364044?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720364044; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.142874; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33077220/,244

METHODS: The PUBMED, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library were searched from inception to March 13, 2021. We searched and analyzed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies (OSs) that examined corticosteroid use in patients with COVID-19. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, while the secondary outcome was the need for mechanical ventilation (MV) and serious adverse events. RESULTS: A total of 11 RCTs and 44 OSs involving 7893 and 41,164 patients with COVID-19 were included in the study. Corticosteroid use was associated with lower COVID-19 mortality in RCTs, but was not statistically significant (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.77–1.07; I(2) = 63.4%). The subgroup analysis of pulse dose corticosteroid showed survival benefit statistically (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.15–0.56). Moreover, the corticosteroid use may reduce the need for MV (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.51–0.90; I(2) = 7.5%) with no significant increase in serious adverse reactions (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.30–2.37; I(2) = 33.3%). In addition, the included OSs showed that the pulse dose (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.45–0.95; I(2) = 30.8%) might lower the mortality in patients with COVID-19. The pulse dose of methylprednisolone (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.45–0.80; I(2) = 0%) had a beneficial effect on survival. It was especially significant when the duration of pulse methylprednisolone use was less than 7 days (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.43–0.80; I(2) = 0%). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis indicated that corticosteroid use might cause a slight reduction in COVID-19 mortality. However, it could significantly reduce the MV requirement in patients with COVID-19 and restrict serious adverse events. Additionally, the pulse dose of methylprednisolone for less than 7 days may be a good treatment choice for patients with COVID-19.

Specific patterns of comorbidities related to COVID-19 deaths have not been investigated. METHODS: A random sample of 6085 individuals in Italy who died in-hospital with confirmed COVID-19 between February and December 2020 were included. Observed to expected (O/E) ratios of disease pairs were computed and logistic regression models were used to determine the association between disease pairs with O/E values ≥ 1.5. RESULTS: Six pairs of diseases exhibited O/E values ≥ 1.5 and statistically significant higher odds of co-occurrence in the crude and adjusted analyses: (1) ischemic heart disease and atrial fibrillation, (2) atrial fibrillation and heart failure, (3) atrial fibrillation and stroke, (4) heart failure and COPD, (5) stroke and dementia, and (6) type 2 diabetes and obesity. CONCLUSION: In those deceased in-hospital due to COVID-19 in Italy, disease combinations defined by multiple cardio-respiratory, metabolic, and neuropsychiatric diseases occur more frequently than expected.

The goal of the present study was to examine the psychometric properties (validity and reliability) of the Persian version of the COVID-19-Impact on Quality of Life (COV19-QoL) scale. METHODS: After translating the scale using the forward–backward method, face and content validly was qualitatively assessed. Then the scale was distributed to 488 individuals from the general population via online platforms. Construct validity was assessed using exploratory (EFA) and confirmatory (CFA) factor analysis. In addition, internal consistency was examined using Cronbach’s alpha coefficient and McDonald’s omega, relative stability was assessed using interclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and absolute stability was calculated through examination of standard error of measurement. RESULTS: The EFA revealed one factor that explained 55.96% of the total variance of the scale. Internal consistencies of 0.823 and 0.882 were found using Cronbach’s alpha coefficient and McDonald’s omega, respectively. In addition, an ICC of 0.837 (with a two-week interval) was found. Covid-19 had a greater impact on the QOL of healthy participants than that of those with underling conditions (p = 0.004), and also on the QOL of single participants than that of married ones (p = 0.032).

After cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation of the virus, the band that contained maximal infectivity was composed of numerous particles with osmiophilic cores similar to those found in infected cell cultures. This finding suggests that such particles represent the infective agent.

Previous studies have indicated that SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid could be detected in the feces of patients even after smear-negative respiratory samples. However, demonstration of confirmed fecal-oral transmission has been difficult. Clinical studies have shown an incidence rate of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms ranging from 2% to 79.1% in patients with COVID-19. They may precede or accompany respiratory symptoms. The most common GI symptoms included nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. In addition, some patients also had liver injury, pancreatic damage, and even acute mesenteric ischemia/thrombosis. Although the incidence rates reported in different centers were quite different, the digestive system was the clinical component of the COVID-19 section. Studies have shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the receptor of SARS-CoV-2, was not only expressed in the lungs, but also in the upper esophagus, small intestine, liver, and colon. The possible mechanism of GI symptoms in COVID-19 patients may include direct viral invasion into target cells, dysregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, immune-mediated tissue injury, and gut dysbiosis caused by microbiota. Additionally, numerous experiences, guidelines, recommendations, and position statements were published or released by different organizations and societies worldwide to optimize the management practice of outpatients, inpatients, and endoscopy in the era of COVID-19.

626822,A Case Series of Stent Thrombosis During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-05-27,"Almost one year has passed since the appearance of SARS-CoV-2, causing the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of confirmed SARS-Cov-2 cases worldwide has now reached ~92 million, with 2 million reported deaths (https://covid19.who.int). Nearly 365,000 SARS-Cov-2 genomes were sequenced from COVID-19 samples and added to public resources such as GISAID (https://gisaid.org). With the vaccines becoming available or entering trials (https://covid19.trackvaccines.org), it is vital to keep track of mutations in the genome of SARS-CoV-2, especially in the Spike protein Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) region, which could have a potential impact on disease severity and treatment strategies. In the wake of a recent increase in cases with a potentially more infective RBD mutation (N501Y) in the United Kingdom, countries worldwide are concerned about the spread of this or similar variants.

According to WHO, the recovery time from COVID-19 was estimated to be 2 weeks for patients with mild infection, and 3 to 6 weeks for those with serious illnesses. A studies regarding the median recovery time and its predictors are limited globally and specifically in Ethiopia. Therefore, the aim of this study was to estimate the median time to recovery from COVID-19 and its predictors among COVID-19 cases admitted to WURH, Western Ethiopian. METHODS: This was a hospital-based retrospective cohort study conducted among 263 adult patients admitted with COVID-19 in WURH treatment center from March 29, 2020 through September 30, 2020. Epidata version 3.2 was used for data entry, and STATA version 14 for analysis. A Cox proportional hazard regression model was fitted to determine factors associated with recovery time. A variable with P-value ≤ 0.25 at bivariable Cox regression analysis were selected for multivariable Cox proportional model. Multivariable Cox regression model with 95% CI and Adjusted Hazard Ratio (AHR) was used to identify a significant predictor of time to recovery from COVID-19 at P-value < 0.05. RESULTS: The mean age of patient was 36.8 (SD± 10.68) years. At the end of follow up, two hundred twenty seven observations were developed an event (recovered) with median time to recovery of 18 days with IQR of 10–27 days. The overall incidence rate of recovery was of 4.38 per 100 (95% CI: 3.84, 4.99) person-days observations. Being older age (AHR = 1.59, 95% CI: 1.02, 2.49), presence of fever on admission (AHR = 1.78, 95% CI: 1.21, 2.62), and comorbidity (AHR = 0.56, 95% CI, 0.34, 0.90) were found to have statistically significant association with recovery time. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS: In general, the median recovery time of patients with COVID-19 cases was long, and factors such as older age group, presence of fever, and comorbidity was an independent predictors of delayed recovery from COVID-19. Intervention to further reduce recovery time at treatment center has to focus on patients those shows symptoms and with comorbidities.","Tolossa, Tadesse; Wakuma, Bizuneh; Seyoum Gebre, Dejene; Merdassa Atomssa, Emiru; Getachew, Motuma; Fetensa, Getahun; Ayala, Diriba; Turi, Ebisa",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34111146/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0252389,244

METHODS: We undertook a secondary analysis of a dataset about 248 care homes in the county of Norfolk, eastern England. The dataset recorded categories of staff (nurses, care workers and non-care workers), their status (available, absent due to leave or sickness and extra staff needed to address the coronavirus pandemic) in the period 6 April -6 May 2020. Counts of residents (if any) at each care home with COVID-19 were also available, as well as descriptions of access by the home to personal protection equipment (PPE: gloves, masks, eye protection, aprons and Sanitiser). PPE access was categorised as (most to least) green, amber or red. We undertook two stage modelling, first for any detection of COVID-19 in the homes, and a second model to relate any increases in case counts after introduction to staffing or PPE levels. RESULTS: We found that the counts of non-care workers had strongest relationships (and only link significant at p < 0.05) to any introduction of SARS-CoV-2 to the homes. After a home had at least one detected case, higher staff levels and more severe PPE shortages were most linked to higher case counts (p < 0.05) during the monitoring period. CONCLUSION: Better managing aspects of staff interaction with residents and some working practices should help reduce ingression to and spread of COVID-19 within residential homes for the elderly.","Brainard, Julii Suzanne; Rushton, Steven; Winters, Tim; Hunter, Paul R",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.17.20133629v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.17.20133629,244

Chronic exposure to such drugs might lower the risk of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19). AIM: To assess COVID-19 incidence and risk of hospitalisation in a cohort of patients chronically taking chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine. METHODS: We used linked health administration databases to follow a cohort of patients with chronic prescription of hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine and a control cohort matched by age, sex and primary care service area, between 1 January and 30 April 2020. COVID-19 cases were identified using International Classification of Diseases 10 codes. RESULTS: We analysed a cohort of 6,746 patients (80% female) with active prescriptions for hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine, and 13,492 controls. During follow-up, there were 97 (1.4%) COVID-19 cases in the exposed cohort and 183 (1.4%) among controls. The incidence rate was very similar between the two groups (12.05 vs 11.35 cases/100,000 person-days). The exposed cohort was not at lower risk of infection compared with controls (hazard ratio (HR): 1.08; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.83–1.44; p = 0.50). Forty cases (0.6%) were admitted to hospital in the exposed cohort and 50 (0.4%) in the control cohort, suggesting a higher hospitalisation rate in the former, though differences were not confirmed after adjustment (HR: 1·46; 95% CI: 0.91–2.34; p = 0.10). CONCLUSIONS: Patients chronically exposed to chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine did not differ in risk of COVID-19 nor hospitalisation, compared with controls. As controls were mainly female, findings might not be generalisable to a male population.","Vivanco-Hidalgo, Rosa Maria; Molina, Israel; Martinez, Elisenda; Roman-Viñas, Ramón; Sánchez-Montalvá, Adrián; Fibla, Joan; Pontes, Caridad; Velasco Muñoz, César",Euro Surveill,https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.es.2021.26.9.2001202; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33663646/,244

To further understand the disease, we compared its clinical characteristics, symptoms, and outcomes by gender. In an analysis of public surveillance data of Taiwan from January 21 to April 18, 2020, a total of 398 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 by the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in pharynx swabs. We divided the patients into two groups: men and women. The associated data were collected, and multivariate comparisons of radiographic infiltration were conducted to analyze the gender-based differences. The mean incubation period was 5.4±5 days, and the incubation period in men was 3.2 days longer than that in women (8±8.1 vs. 4.8±3, p=0.05). The male patients with COVID-19 with infiltration in chest X-rays (CXR) were 12 years older than their female counterparts. The mortality rate in the male patients with COVID-19 was 6.4-fold higher than that in the female patients (3.2% vs. 0.5%, p<0.05). The patients with co-morbidities of diabetes mellitus and hypertension were vulnerable to infiltration in CXR, and the patients with COVID-19 who had infiltration in CXR easily ended up with intubation, intensive care unit admission, and mortality. Moreover, female patients with COVID-19 who had fever, cough, and dyspnea were susceptible to infiltration in CXR. Irrespective of whether the cases were imported female from Europe, America, or Asia, indigenous male, the factors associated with death in patients with severe COVID-19 were male sex, elderly, female with fever, cough, dyspnea and DM.","Su, Yu-Jang; Kuo, Kuan-Chih; Wang, Ta-Wei; Chang, Chen-Wang",New Microbes New Infect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34031638/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S205229752100069X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S205229752100069X?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nmni.2021.100905,244

Methods: Online cross-sectional survey of 1,500 UK adults, recruited from an existing online research panel. Data were collected between 14th and 17th July 2020. We used linear regression analyses to investigate associations between intention to be vaccinated for COVID-19 when a vaccine becomes available to you and socio-demographic factors, previous influenza vaccination, general vaccine attitudes and beliefs, attitudes and beliefs about COVID-19, and attitudes and beliefs about a COVID-19 vaccination. Results: 64% of participants reported being likely to be vaccinated against COVID-19; 27% were unsure and 9% reported being unlikely to be vaccinated. Personal and clinical characteristics, previous influenza vaccination, general vaccination beliefs, and beliefs and attitudes about COVID-19 and a COVID-19 vaccination explained 77% of the variance in vaccination intention. Intention to be vaccinated was associated with more positive general COVID-19 vaccination beliefs and attitudes, weaker beliefs that the vaccination would cause side effects or be unsafe, greater perceived information sufficiency to make an informed decision about COVID-19 vaccination, greater perceived risk of COVID-19 to others but not oneself, older age, and having been vaccinated for influenza last winter (2019/20). Conclusions: Despite uncertainty around the details of a COVID-19 vaccination, most participants reported intending to be vaccinated for COVID-19. Actual uptake will likely be lower. Vaccination intention reflects general vaccine beliefs and attitudes. Campaigns and messaging about a COVID-19 vaccination should emphasize the risk of COVID-19 to others and necessity for everyone to be vaccinated.","Sherman, S. M.; Smith, L.

We evaluated the role of early hospitalization in combination with early antiviral therapy with COVID-19 patients in a tertiary care university hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective, observational, single-center study on probable/confirmed COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a tertiary care hospital on COVID-19 wards between March 20 and April 30, 2020. The demographic, laboratory, and clinical data were collected. RESULTS: We included 174 consecutive probable/confirmed COVID-19 adult patients hospitalized in the Internal Medicine wards of the University Adult Hospital between March 20 and April 30, 2020. The median age was 45.5 (19–92) years and 91 patients (52.3%) were male. One hundred and twenty (69%) were confirmed microbiologically, 41 (23.5%) were radiologically diagnosed, and 13 (7.5%) were clinically suspected (negative microbiological and radiological findings compatible with COVID-19); 35 (20.1%) had mild, 107 (61.5%) moderate disease, and 32 (18.4%) had severe pneumonia. Out of 171 cases, 130 (74.3%) showed pneumonia; 80 were typical, and 50 showed indeterminate infiltration for COVID-19. Patients were admitted within a median of 3 days (0-14 days) after symptoms appear. The median duration of hospitalization was 4 days (0-28 days). In this case series, 13.2% patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine alone, 64.9% with hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin, and 18.4% with regimens including favipiravir. A total of 15 patients (8.5%) were transferred to the ICU. Four patients died (2.2%). CONCLUSION: In our series, 174 patients were admitted to the hospital wards for COVID-19, 69% were confirmed with PCR and/or antibody test. At the time of admission, nearly one fifth of the patients had severe diseases. Of the patients, 95.4% received hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination.

We developed an agent-based model to precise the impact of digital contact tracing and household isolation on COVID-19 transmission. The model, calibrated on French population, integrates demographic, contact and epidemiological information to describe exposure and transmission of COVID-19. We explored realistic levels of case detection, app adoption, population immunity, and transmissibility. Assuming a reproductive ratio R = 2.6 and 50% detection of clinical cases, a ~20% app adoption reduces peak incidence by ~35%. With R = 1.7, >30% app adoption lowers the epidemic to manageable levels. Higher coverage among adults, playing a central role in COVID-19 transmission, yields an indirect benefit for the elderly. These results may inform the inclusion of digital contact tracing within a COVID-19 response plan.","Moreno López, Jesús A.; Arregui García, Beatriz; Bentkowski, Piotr; Bioglio, Livio; Pinotti, Francesco; Boëlle, Pierre-Yves; Barrat, Alain; Colizza, Vittoria; Poletto, Chiara",Sci Adv,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abd8750; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33712416/,244

SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects cells of the respiratory tract, via Spike glycoprotein binding angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2). Circadian rhythms coordinate an organism’s response to its environment and can regulate host susceptibility to virus infection. We demonstrate a circadian regulation of ACE2 in lung epithelial cells and show that silencing BMAL1 or treatment with a synthetic REV-ERB agonist SR9009 reduces ACE2 expression and inhibits SARS-CoV-2 entry. Treating infected cells with SR9009 limits viral replication and secretion of infectious particles, showing that post-entry steps in the viral life cycle are influenced by the circadian system. Transcriptome analysis revealed that Bmal1 silencing induced a wide spectrum of interferon stimulated genes in Calu-3 lung epithelial cells, providing a mechanism for the circadian pathway to dampen SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The currently used serological lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs) can only detect the presence of antibodies for a single antigen. Here, we fabricated a multiplexed circular flow immunoassay (CFIA) test strip with YOLO v4-based object recognition that can quickly quantify and differentiate antibodies that bind membrane glycoprotein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or hemagglutinin of influenza A (H1N1) virus in the sera of immunized mice in one assay using one sample. Spot intensities were found to be indicative of antibody titers to membrane glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 and were, thus, quantified relative to spots from immunoglobulin G (IgG) reaction in a CFIA to account for image heterogeneity. Quantitative intensities can be displayed in real time alongside an image of CFIA that was captured by a built-in camera.

639475,COVID-19 pneumonia in two patients with ankylosing spondylitis using anti-TNF agents,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Illnesses requiring hospitalization are known to negatively impact psychological well-being and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) after discharge. The impact of hospitalization during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic on psychological well-being and health-related quality of life is expected to be higher due to the exceptional circumstances within and outside the hospital during the pandemic surge. The objective of this study was to quantify psychological distress up to three months after discharge in patients hospitalized during the first coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic wave. We also aimed to determine HRQoL, to explore predictors for psychological distress and HRQoL, and to examine whether psychological distress was higher in COVID-19 confirmed patients, and in those treated in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). METHODS: In this single-center, observational cohort study, adult patients hospitalized with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 between March 16 and April 28, 2020, were enrolled. Patients were stratified in analyses based on SARS-CoV-2 PCR results and the necessity for ICU treatment. The primary outcome was psychological distress, expressed as symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression, up to three months post-discharge. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was the secondary outcome. Exploratory outcomes comprised predictors for psychological distress and HRQoL. RESULTS: 294 of 622 eligible patients participated in this study (median age 64 years, 36% female). 16% and 13% of these patients reported probable PTSD, 29% and 20% probable anxiety, and 32% and 24% probabledepression at one and three months after hospital discharge, respectively. ICU patients reported less frequently probable depression, but no differences were found in PTSD, anxiety, or overall HRQoL. COVID-19 patients had a worse physical quality of life one month after discharge, and ICU patients reported a better mental quality of life three months after discharge. PTSD severity was predicted by time after discharge and being Caucasian. Severity of anxiety was predicted by time after discharge and being Caucasian. Depression severity was predicted by time after discharge and educational level. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 suspected patients hospitalized during the pandemic frequently suffer from psychological distress and poor health-related quality of life after hospital discharge. Non-COVID-19 and non-ICU patients appear to be at least as affected as COVID-19 and ICU patients, underscoring that (post-)hospital pandemic care should not predominantly focus on COVID-19 infected patients.","Vlake, Johan Hendrik; Wesselius, Sanne; van Genderen, Michel Egide; van Bommel, Jasper; Boxma-de Klerk, Bianca; Wils, Evert-Jan",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34379644/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255774,244

This disease causes the infection of bursa, which leads to major immune losses. A total number of 30 samples from five IBD outbreaks during the period of 2019-20 were collected from different areas of Faisalabad district, Pakistan and assayed by targeting the IBD virus VP2 region through RT-PCR. Among all the outbreaks, almost 80% of poultry birds were found positive for the IBDV. The bursa tissues were collected from the infected birds and histopathological examination of samples revealed severe lymphocytic depletion, infiltration of inflammatory cells, and necrosis of the bursa of Fabricius (BF). Positive samples were subjected to re-isolation and molecular characterization of IBDV. The Pakistan IBDV genes were subjected to DNA sequencing to determine the virus nucleotide sequences. The sequences of 100 Serotype-I IBDVs showing nearest homology were compared and identified with the study sequence. The construction of the phylogenetic tree for nucleotide sequences was accomplished by the neighbor-joining method in MEGA-6 with reference strains. The VP2 segment reassortment of IBDVs carrying segment A were identified as one important type of circulating strains in Pakistan. The findings indicated the molecular features of the Pakistan IBDV strains playing a role in the evolution of new strains of the virus, which will contribute to the vaccine selection and effective prevention of the disease.","Sajid, Sanaullah; Rahman, Sajjad Ur; Mohsin Gilani, Mashkoor; Sindhu, Zia Ud Din; Ali, Manel Ben; Hedfi, Amor; Almalki, Mohammed; Mahmood, Shahid",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254605; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34398875/,244
640850,Post COVID-19 opportunistic candida retinitis: A case report,2021-03-16,"BACKGROUND: Globally, trans people are disproportionately affected by HIV, but research on strategies to increase testing are limited. SELPHI is a randomised-controlled-trial (RCT) of 10,135 cis men, trans men, and trans women reporting lifetime anal intercourse with male partners (cis or trans), evaluating whether the offer of free HIV self-testing (HIVST) increases diagnosis. This subgroup analysis from the SELPHI RCT aims to describe key HIVST outcomes and HIVST acceptability for trans people. METHODS: SELPHI recruited using social networking and trans focused social media. Participants were randomised 60/40 to baseline HIVST (Biosure™) (BT) vs no baseline HIVST (nBT); and at 3-months (if completed the survey and reported recent CAI) 50/50 to 3-monthly HIVST (RT) vs no repeat HIVST (nRT). Outcomes were self-reported through online surveys. We conducted a qualitative study of semi-structured peer-led participant interviews (n = 20) exploring HIVST motivations and experiences. These were analysed using a framework approach. FINDINGS: SELPHI recruited and randomised 118 trans men and trans women (94 trans men, 24 trans women), of whom 20 (16 trans men, 4 trans women) underwent the second randomisation. Median age at baseline was 29 (IQR: 22, 37), 79% were white, 79% were UK born, 37% had degree level education, and 31% had never tested for HIV. 62% (n = 59) of trans men completed the 3-month survey, but survey completion by trans women in nBT was too low (1/11) for randomised comparison. In trans men HIV testing uptake by 3 months was significantly higher in BT (95% 36/38) vs nBT (29%, 6/21) (RR=3.32 (1.68, 6.55) p<0.001). Trans people randomised to RT reported 3 times higher rate of HIV testing compared to nRT during the two-year follow-up (IRR 3.66 (1.86, 8.01) p<0.0001). STI testing frequency (mean number of tests during each 13 week period/ 2-year follow-up) was not significantly different across interventions: RT (0.03) and nRT (0.01) (IRR=1.86 95%CI; 0.77, 5.15; p = 0.15). Social harms were rare. Acceptability was very high in BT: 97% (38/39) found instructions easy to understand, 97% (37/38) found the HIVST simple to use and 100% (39/39) reported good overall experience. In interviews, reported HIVST benefits included increased autonomy, privacy, convenience and avoidance of health care providers perceived to be discriminatory and services that increased dysphoria. Minor lancet and test processing issues were reported. INTERPRETATION: HIVST significantly increased testing uptake and frequency in trans men and trans people overall, although recruitment and retention of trans women was low. HIVST acceptability was high and indicates easy access to this novel technology may increase HIV testing access for this key population.","Witzel, T.

The aim of the study is to identify combination of factors facilitating SARS-CoV-2 transmission and the impact of control measures in a dormitory through extensive epidemiological, serological and phylogenetic investigations, supported by simulation models. Our findings showed that asymptomatic cases and symptomatic cases who did not seek medical attention were major drivers of the outbreak. Furthermore, each resident had about 30 close contacts and each infected resident spread to 4.4 (IQR 3.5–5.3) others at the start of the outbreak. The final attack rate of the current outbreak was 76.2% (IQR 70.6–98.0%) and could be reduced by further 10% under a modified dormitory housing condition. These findings are important when designing living environments in a post COVID-19 future to reduce disease spread and facilitate rapid implementation of outbreak control measures.","Pung, Rachael; Lin, Bernard; Maurer-Stroh, Sebastian; Sirota, Fernanda L.; Mak, Tze Minn; Octavia, Sophie; Pang, Junxiong; Tan, Iain Beehuat; Tan, Clive; Ong, Biauw Chi; Cook, Alex R.; Lee, Vernon J.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34315928/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-94463-3,244

In India and densely populated countries like Brazil and USA the numbers are still rising. Clinicians all over the world are trying to contain it by minimizing the cross-transmission of disease among hospital staff members. In the field of Otorhinolaryngology (ENT) the doctors are exposed to high viral load while examining the patients. Therefore contingency plans are required for dealing with patients in outpatient clinics, and while performing diagnostic endoscopies, minor procedures in OPD and surgeries in operating rooms. Infected patients may shed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 particles into their environment via body secretions. Therefore, Otolaryngologists should be vigilant. In this submission, we share our experience of an innovative practice plan in redesigning the ENT OPD setup, endoscopy set up and OT so as to reduce the risk of transmission of virus not only to doctors but other healthcare workers. We hope that our modifications will serve as a guide for every Otolaryngologist throughout India towards performing their clinical duties confidently without any apprehension and ensuring adequate safety during this testing times in their small set-up/ clinical establishments.","Yeolekar, Aditya; Bhalerao, Sudhir; Bhalerao, Maya",Indian J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12070-020-02140-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32953632/,244

We aimed to investigate how these changes have been perceived by patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer and identify determinants of increased anxiety. PATIENTS AND METHODS: An anonymised 32-item survey in a specialised lower gastrointestinal cancer outpatient clinics at a tertiary cancer centre in North West England between 18 May and 1 July 2020. Self-reported anxiety based on General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) screening tool. RESULTS: Of 143 participants who completed the survey (response rate 67%), 115 (82%) were male and median age group was 61-70 years. 112 (78%) participants had telephone consultation (83% met needs), and 57 (40%) had radiological scan results discussed over the phone (96% met needs). In total, 23 (18%) participants were considered to have anxiety (GAD-7 score ≥ 5), with 7 (5.5%) scoring for moderate or severe anxiety. Those concerned about getting COVID-19 infection, and worried COVID-19 would have effect on their mental health, and affect their experience of cancer care, were most likely to have anxiety (p<0.05, multivariate analysis). Majority did not feel they needed support during this phase of the pandemic. Participants felt that friends and family had been very supportive, but less so the primary care services (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this survey suggest that some of the service changes implemented may have already improved the overall experience of cancer care amongst patients with colorectal cancer at our institute. Reassuringly, the incidence of participants with moderate to severe anxiety levels during the peak of COVID-19 in the UK was much lower than anticipated. Importantly, patients were much more concerned about their cancer treatment than COVID-19, emphasising the need to continue to provide comprehensive cancer care even with a “2(nd) wave” of COVID-19.","Kamposioras, Konstantinos; Saunders, Mark; Jonathan Lim, Kok Haw; Marti, Kalena; Anderson, Daniel; Cutting, Mark; McCool, Danielle; Connell, Jacqueline; Simpson, Lilly; Hasan, Jurjees; Braun, Michael; Lavin, Victoria; Mullamitha, Saifee; Barriuso, Jorge",Clin Colorectal Cancer,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1533002820301687; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clcc.2020.11.006; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1533002820301687?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33384244/,244

The serotoninergic neurons in the dorsal and median raphe project widely in the brain. They innervate the olfactory bulbs and can be targets for exogenous agents attacking the olfactory epithelium and bulbs. We report here an injury to the serotoninergic neurons after intranasal infection in 12-day-old rats with a temperature-sensitive mutant of vesicular stomatitis virus. The brain infection was focal and transient. Viral antigens could no longer be detected 13–15 days after infection. In spite of this the animals, as adults, had a severe serotonin depletion in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, and showed abnormal locomotor and explorative behaviour as well as learning deficits. The neocortex was histologically intact and parameters related to other neurotransmitters such as dopamine, noradrenaline, GABA and acetylcholine showed no marked changes. A relatively selective damage to serotoninergic nuclei as a result of virus neuroinvasion through a natural portal of entry, may constitute a new pathogenetic mechanism for cortical dysfunction and behavioural deficits.","Mohammed, A.

The aim of this research was to use a viral cell cycle model of SARS‐CoV‐2 to explore the potential impact drugs, or combinations of drugs, that act at different stages in the viral life cycle might have on various metrics of infection outcome relevant in the early stages of COVID‐19 disease. METHODS: Using a target‐cell limited model structure that has been used to characterize viral load dynamics from COVID‐19 patients, we performed simulations to inform on the combinations of therapeutics targeting specific rate constants. The endpoints and metrics included viral load area under the curve (AUC), duration of viral shedding and epithelial cells infected. Based on the known kinetics of the SARS‐CoV‐2 life cycle, we rank ordered potential targeted approaches involving repurposed, low‐potency agents. RESULTS: Our simulations suggest that targeting multiple points central to viral replication within infected host cells or release from those cells is a viable strategy for reducing both viral load and host cell infection. In addition, we observed that the time‐window opportunity for a therapeutic intervention to effect duration of viral shedding exceeds the effect on sparing epithelial cells from infection or impact on viral load AUC. Furthermore, the impact on reduction on duration of shedding may extend further in patients who exhibit a prolonged shedder phenotype.

Methods: This is a retrospective observational cross-sectional study including consecutive patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who underwent unenhanced chest CT upon admittance at the emergency room (ER) in one large academic hospital. QCT was used for the calculation of compromised lung volume (%CL). Clinical data were retrieved from patients’ files. Laboratory data were obtained upon presentation at the ER. Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between hemostatic abnormalities and lung involvement in patients affected by COVID-19 pneumonia as described using computer-aided quantitative evaluation of chest CT (quantitative CT (QCT)). Results: A total of 510 consecutive patients (68% males), aged 67 years in median, diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia, who underwent unenhanced CT scan upon admission to the ER, were included. In all, 115 patients had %CL > 23%; compared to those with %CL < 23%, they showed higher levels of D-dimer, fibrinogen, and CRP, greater platelet count, and longer PT ratio. Via multivariate regression analysis, BMI ≥ 30 kg/m(2), D-dimer levels > 500 ng/mL, CRP > 5.0 ng/mL and PT ratio > 1.2 were found to be independent predictors of a %CL > 23% (adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals): 2.1 (1.1–4.0), 3.1 (1.6–5.8), 2.4 (1.3–4.5), and 3.4 (1.4–8.5), respectively).

649251,Acute Demyelinating Encephalomyelitis (ADEM) in COVID-19 infection: A Case Series.,2020-07-17,"The paper analyses the impacts of COVID-19 on daily public transport ridership in the three most populated regions of Sweden (Stockholm, Västra Götaland and Skåne) during spring 2020. The analysis breaks down the overall ridership with respect to ticket types, youths and seniors, and transport modes based on ticket validations, sales and passenger counts data. By utilizing disaggregate ticket validation data with consistent card ids we further investigate to what extent fewer people travelled, or each person travelled less, during the pandemic. The decrease in public transport ridership (40%–60% across regions) was severe compared with other transport modes. Ridership was not restricted by service levels as supply generally remained unchanged throughout the period. The ridership reduction stems primarily from a lower number of active public transport travellers. Travellers switched from monthly period tickets to single tickets and travel funds, while the use and the sales of short period tickets, used predominantly by tourists, dropped to almost zero. One-year period tickets and school tickets increased from mid-April, which could indicate that the travellers using these tickets are particularly captive to the public transport system. Collaborative effort is required to put the results in the international context.","Jenelius, Erik; Cebecauer, Matej",Transportation Research Interdisciplinary Perspectives,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trip.2020.100242; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301536; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34173478/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590198220301536,244

The presence of cytokine storm has been linked with the pathogenesis of severe lung injury as evinced in Covid-19. Aquaporins (AQPs) are molecular water channels, facilitating water transport across the cell membrane in response to osmotic gradients. Impairment in alveolar fluid clearance due to altered functional expression of respiratory AQPs highlight their pathophysiological significance in pulmonary edema associated respiratory illness. Therefore, we hypothesize that targeted modulation of AQPs in lungs in the intervening period of time, could diminish the dreadful effects of inflammation- induced comorbidity in Covid-19.","Flora Mariajoseph-Antony, Lezy; Kannan, Arun; Panneerselvam, Antojenifer; Loganathan, Chithra; Anbarasu, Kumarasamy; Prahalathan, Chidambaram",Med Hypotheses,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987720324701; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987720324701?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33017909/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110201,244

In these patients, volatile sedation may represent a valid alternative to IV drugs. The aim of our study was to describe the feasibility of volatile sedation in a large cohort of acute respiratory distress syndrome patients undergoing venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and ultraprotective ventilation. DESIGN: Retrospective monocentric study. SETTING: Adult ICU, ASST Monza, Italy. PATIENTS: Adult patients who underwent volatile sedation with isoflurane during venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation between 2009 and 2019. INTERVENTIONS: Isoflurane was delivered via the AnaConDa system. The sedation level, hemodynamics, and laboratory tests were compared between the volatile sedation phase and the IV sedation phases before and after the isoflurane sedation period. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: About 74 patients (50 yr [43–56 yr]) were included. Median duration of venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support was 22 days (14–51 d). Volatile sedation started on day 3 (2–6) of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support, and its median duration was 7 days (4–13 d), ranging from 1 to 38 days. A total of 970 venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation days were analyzed. During the volatile phase, the sedation level was slightly deeper (bispectral index 39 ± 6) compared with the IV phase before and after isoflurane (42 ± 8 and 43 ± 9, respectively, p < 0.001). Requirements of fentanyl and remifentanyl were reduced during the volatile phase. Minor differences in hemodynamics were observed during volatile sedation: mean arterial pressure was lower (75 ± 13 vs 79 ± 14 and 80 ± 15; p < 0.001), whereas cardiac output was higher (8.5 ± 1.9 vs 7.9 ± 1.8 and 8.0 ± 1.8; p = 0.003). Aspartate aminotransferase levels were lower during the volatile sedation phases (p < 0.001), whereas alanine aminotransferase, triglycerides, and creatine phosphokinase were more altered during the IV sedation phase before isoflurane (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Volatile sedation represents an alternative to IV agents to achieve long-term deep sedation in critically ill patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation undergoing ultraprotective ventilation.","Grasselli, Giacomo; Giani, Marco; Scaravilli, Vittorio; Fumagalli, Benedetta; Mariani, Carminia; Redaelli, Sara; Lucchini, Alberto; Zanella, Alberto; Patroniti, Nicolò; Pesenti, Antonio; Foti, Giuseppe",Crit Care Explor,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33458679/; https://doi.org/10.1097/cce.0000000000000310,244

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is only curative treatment for the disease. However, there is limited information about long‐term outcome of HSCT and its effect to protect against cancer development in DOCK8‐deficient patients. In this study, we retrospectively evaluated clinical and immunologic characteristics of 20 DOCK8‐deficient patients and outcome of 11 patients who underwent HSCT. We aimed to report the experience of our center and the result of the largest transplantation series of DOCK8 deficiency in our country. Median follow‐up time is 71 months (min‐max: 16‐172) in all patients and 48 months (min‐max: 5‐84) in transplanted patients. Atopic dermatitis (18/20), recurrent respiratory tract infections (17/20), and food allergy (14/20) were the most frequent clinical manifestations. Failure to thrive (13/20), liver problems (12/20), bronchiectasis (11/20), chronic diarrhea (10/21), and autism spectrum disorders (3/20) were remarkable findings in our series. Elevated IgE level (20/20) and eosinophilia (17/20), low IgM level (15/20), and decreased CD3+ T (10/20) and CD4+ T (11/20) cell count were prominent laboratory findings. HSCT was performed in 11 patients. All patients achieved adequate engraftment and showed improvement in their clinical and immunologic findings. Atopic dermatitis and food allergies improved in all patients, and their dietary restriction was stopped except one patient who was transplanted recently. The frequency of infections was decreased. The overall survival is 91% in HSCT‐received patients and 80% in all. HSCT at the earliest possible period with most suitable donor‐ and patient‐specific appropriate conditioning regimen and GvHD prophylaxis is lifesaving for DOCK8 deficiency cases.","Haskologlu, Sule; Kostel Bal, Sevgi; Islamoglu, Candan; Aytekin, Caner; Guner, Sukru; Sevinc, Selin; Keles, Sevgi; Kendirli, Tanil; Ceylaner, Serdar; Dogu, Figen; Ikinciogullari, Aydan",Pediatr Allergy Immunol,https://doi.org/10.1111/pai.13236; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32108967/,244

Initially, the treatment for severe respiratory failure included early intubation and invasive ventilation, as this was deemed preferable to be more effective than Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV). However, emerging evidence has shown that NIV may have a more significant and positive role than initially thought. NIV includes Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) and Bi-Level Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP). CPAP is the method of choice with the use of BiPAP for those with complex respiratory conditions who contract COVID-19. The use of High Flow Nasal Oxygen (HFNO) remains contentious with different perspectives in how this modality can be used to treat respiratory failure in COVID-19. Current thinking suggests that NIV and HFNO may be an appropriate bridging adjunct in the early part of the disease progress and may prevent the need for intubation or invasive ventilation. Patients requiring NIV or HFNO may be nursed in locations outside of the critical care unit. Therefore, this article reviews the different types of NIV and HFNO, indications and the nursing care.","Carter, Chris; Aedy, Helen; Notter, Joy",,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666869620300063?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666869620300063,244

Multilevel regression models were fitted with individual, household, and state-level covariates, in addition to state and census-region-level random effects. Living in state with the highest quartile of small business closures was associated with increased prevalence of GAD (OR: 1.06; CI: 1.03–1.11) compared to lowest quartile, but had no association with MDD. Living in the highest quartile of urban mobility was associated with lower prevalence of both GAD (OR: 0.88; CI: 0.85–0.93) and MDD (OR: 0.90; CI: 0.86–0.95) relative to the lowest quartile.

658183,Incomplete Kawasaki Disease as Presentation of COVID-19 Infection in an Infant: A Case Report,2020-08-05,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Here, we reveal that basal turnover and autophagy-induced decay of the ubiquitin E3 ligase TRAF6 is antagonized by IKKε-mediated phosphorylation at five serines. Phosphoproteomic experiments show that TRAF6 and its phosphorylation contribute to the remodeling of LPS- and autophagyinduced signaling networks, revealing an intricate link between inflammatory and metabolic processes that are frequently dysregulated in cancer. ABSTRACT: The ubiquitin E3 ligase TNF Receptor Associated Factor 6 (TRAF6) participates in a large number of different biological processes including innate immunity, differentiation and cell survival, raising the need to specify and shape the signaling output. Here, we identify a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-dependent increase in TRAF6 association with the kinase IKKε (inhibitor of NF-κB kinase subunit ε) and IKKε-mediated TRAF6 phosphorylation at five residues. The reconstitution of TRAF6-deficient cells, with TRAF6 mutants representing phosphorylation-defective or phospho-mimetic TRAF6 variants, showed that the phospho-mimetic TRAF6 variant was largely protected from basal ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated degradation, and also from autophagy-mediated decay in autolysosomes induced by metabolic perturbation. In addition, phosphorylation of TRAF6 and its E3 ligase function differentially shape basal and LPS-triggered signaling networks, as revealed by phosphoproteome analysis. Changes in LPS-triggered phosphorylation networks of cells that had experienced autophagy are partially dependent on TRAF6 and its phosphorylation status, suggesting an involvement of this E3 ligase in the interplay between metabolic and inflammatory circuits.","Busch, Julia; Moreno, Rita; de la Vega, Laureano; Saul, Vera Vivian; Bacher, Susanne; von Zweydorf, Felix; Ueffing, Marius; Weber, Axel; Gloeckner, Christian Johannes; Linne, Uwe; Kracht, Michael; Schmitz, Michael Lienhard",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34298830/; https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers13143618,244

The role of S100A12 in parasite and viral infections is also difficult to study in traditional animal models due to the lack of S100A12 expression in rodents. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate fecal S100A12 concentrations in a cohort of puppies with intestinal parasites (Cystoisospora spp., Toxocara canis, Giardia sp.) and viral agents that are frequently encountered and known to cause gastrointestinal signs in dogs (coronavirus, parvovirus) as a comparative model. METHODS: Spot fecal samples were collected from 307 puppies [median age (range): 7 (4−13) weeks; 29 different breeds] in French breeding kennels, and fecal scores (semiquantitative system; scores 1−13) were assigned. Fecal samples were tested for Cystoisospora spp. (C. canis and C. ohioensis), Toxocara canis, Giardia sp., as well as canine coronavirus (CCV) and parvovirus (CPV). S100A12 concentrations were measured in all fecal samples using an in-house radioimmunoassay. Statistical analyses were performed using non-parametric 2-group or multiple-group comparisons, non-parametric correlation analysis, association testing between nominal variables, and construction of a multivariate mixed model. RESULTS: Fecal S100A12 concentrations ranged from < 24−14,363 ng/g. Univariate analysis only showed increased fecal S100A12 concentrations in dogs shedding Cystoisospora spp. (P = 0.0384) and in dogs infected with parvovirus (P = 0.0277), whereas dogs infected with coronavirus had decreased fecal S100A12 concentrations (P = 0.0345). However, shedding of any single enteropathogen did not affect fecal S100A12 concentrations in multivariate analysis (all P > 0.05) in this study. Only fecal score and breed size had an effect on fecal S100A12 concentrations in multivariate analysis (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: An infection with any single enteropathogen tested in this study is unlikely to alter fecal S100A12 concentrations, and these preliminary data are important for further studies evaluating fecal S100A12 concentrations in dogs or when using fecal S100A12 concentrations as a biomarker in patients with chronic idiopathic gastrointestinal inflammation.","Heilmann, Romy M.; Grellet, Aurélien; Grützner, Niels; Cranford, Shannon M.; Suchodolski, Jan S.; Chastant-Maillard, Sylvie; Steiner, Jörg M.",Parasit Vectors,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13071-018-2841-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29665827/,244

METHODS: Patients with previously diagnosed NMIBC and followed up in clinical practice settings in two French urology departments between September 2017 and July 2019 were consecutively enrolled in this prospective observational study. Patients with a positive cystoscopy or computed tomography urogram underwent subsequent transurethral resection of the bladder, and/or biopsy, and the specimens were pathologically assessed. Cytology and Xpert BC Monitor tests were performed on urine samples. Xpert BC Monitor performance was assessed versus cystoscopy for disease-negative patients or versus histology for disease-positive patients, and was compared to that of cytology. RESULTS: Overall, 500 patients with a median age of 70.0 years were included. NMIBC recurrence was diagnosed in 44 cases (8.8%). Overall sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive values (NPVs) were 72.7% (32/44), 73.7% (330/448) and 96.5% (330/342) for the Xpert BC Monitor, and 7.7% (2/26), 97.8% (310/317) and 92.8% (310/334) for cytology, respectively. The Xpert BC Monitor detected 92.3% (12/13) of the high-grade tumours and ruled out their presence in 99.7% (330/331) of cases. Analysis of the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves demonstrated the superior performance of the Xpert BC Monitor over that of cytology. CONCLUSION: Xpert BC Monitor performance was superior to that of cytology in the follow-up of NMIBC.

METHODS: SONG-CKD involves four phases: a systematic review to identify outcomes (domains and measures) that have been reported in randomised controlled trials involving adults with CKD who do not require kidney replacement therapy; stakeholder key informant interviews with health professionals involved in the care of adults with CKD to ascertain their views on establishing core outcomes in CKD; an international two-round online Delphi survey with patients, caregivers, clinicians, researchers, policy makers and industry representatives to obtain consensus on critically important outcome domains; and stakeholder consensus workshops to review and finalise the set of core outcome domains for trials in CKD. DISCUSSION: Establishing a core outcome set to be reported in trials in patients with CKD will enhance the relevance, transparency and impact of research to improve the lives of people with CKD.

The disease modifying therapies in pwMS can add a more severe risk of infection when compared to the general population. Alemtuzumab is an anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody and it is one of the most immunosuppressive drugs used in Multiple Sclerosis (MS). CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a case of Covid-19 infection that occurred in a 24-year-old woman with MS and treated with alemtuzumab. The infection occurred 4 months after administration of the first course of alemtuzumab and had a benign course with subsequent development of antibodies. Furthermore, we present a brief review of the literature on similar published cases. DISCUSSION: We reviewed 17 articles concerning COVID-19 infection in MS patients in treatment with Alemtuzumab. In our case and all screened cases no severe course of disease was noted and no fatality was observed. Systematic compilation of this observation comforts clinicians about the course of Covid-19 infection despite alemtuzumab immunosuppressive treatment CONCLUSIONS: The risk of serious COVID-19 disease in MS patients treated with alemtuzumab is unknown. Physicians need to monitor carefully pwMS treated with alemtuzumab and to consider COVID-19 infection related relapse in the MS patients. Further research is recommended to evaluate the beneficial-risk profile of alemtuzumab in pandemic era.","Iovino, Aniello; Olivieri, Nunzio; Aruta, Francesco; Giaquinto, Emanuele; Ruggiero, Lucia; Spina, Emanuele; Tozza, Stefano; Manganelli, Fiore; Iodice, Rosa",Mult Scler Relat Disord,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211034821001759; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33812222/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211034821001759?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2021.102908,244

This study aims to determine if a client-focused motivational support package for smoking reduction (and quitting) and increasing (or otherwise using) physical activity (PA) can help smokers who do not wish to quit immediately to reduce the amount they smoke, and ultimately quit. This paper reports the study design and methods. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A pragmatic, multicentred, parallel, two group, randomised controlled superiority clinical trial, with embedded process evaluation and economics evaluation. Participants who wished to reduce smoking with no immediate plans to quit were randomised 1:1 to receive either (1) tailored individual health trainer face-to-face and/or telephone support to reduce smoking and increase PA as an aid to smoking reduction (intervention) or (2) brief written/electronic advice to reduce or quit smoking (control). Participants in both arms of the trial were also signposted to usual local support for smoking reduction and quitting. The primary outcome measure is 6-month carbon monoxide-confirmed floating prolonged abstinence following participant self-reported quitting on a mailed questionnaire at 3 and 9 months post-baseline. Participants confirmed as abstinent at 9 months will be followed up at 15 months. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Approved by SW Bristol National Health Service Research Committee (17/SW/0223). Dissemination will include publication of findings for the stated outcomes, parallel process evaluation and economic evaluation in peer-reviewed journals.

This type of intervention can be administered during the early stages of infection, while a specific immune response is being developed. With this idea in mind, double-faced peptide-based boosters were computationally designed to allow recognition of SARS-CoV-2 by Hepatitis B antibodies. One booster face is made of ACE2-mimic peptides that can bind to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. The other booster face is composed of a Hepatitis B core-antigen, targeting the Hepatitis B antibody fragment. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the designed boosters have a highly specific and stable binding to both the RBD and the antibody fragment (AF). This approach can provide a cheap and efficient neutralization of emerging pathogens.","Han, Yanxiao; McReynolds, Katherine D.; Král, Petr",J Phys Chem Lett,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33523655/; https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.0c03615,244
663536,Mathematical Modeling and Analysis of COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria,2020-06-02,"BACKGROUND: There are characteristic findings of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on chest images. An artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm to detect COVID-19 on chest radiographs might be useful for triage or infection control within a hospital setting, but prior reports have been limited by small data sets, poor data quality, or both. PURPOSE: To present DeepCOVID-XR, a deep learning AI algorithm to detect COVID-19 on chest radiographs, that was trained and tested on a large clinical data set. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DeepCOVID-XR is an ensemble of convolutional neural networks developed to detect COVID-19 on frontal chest radiographs, with reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction test results as the reference standard. The algorithm was trained and validated on 14 788 images (4253 positive for COVID-19) from sites across the Northwestern Memorial Health Care System from February 2020 to April 2020 and was then tested on 2214 images (1192 positive for COVID-19) from a single hold-out institution. Performance of the algorithm was compared with interpretations from five experienced thoracic radiologists on 300 random test images using the McNemar test for sensitivity and specificity and the DeLong test for the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). RESULTS: A total of 5853 patients (mean age, 58 years ± 19 [standard deviation]; 3101 women) were evaluated across data sets. For the entire test set, accuracy of DeepCOVID-XR was 83%, with an AUC of 0.90. For 300 random test images (134 positive for COVID-19), accuracy of DeepCOVID-XR was 82%, compared with that of individual radiologists (range, 76%–81%) and the consensus of all five radiologists (81%). DeepCOVID-XR had a significantly higher sensitivity (71%) than one radiologist (60%, P < .001) and significantly higher specificity (92%) than two radiologists (75%, P < .001; 84%, P = .009). AUC of DeepCOVID-XR was 0.88 compared with the consensus AUC of 0.85 (P = .13 for comparison). With consensus interpretation as the reference standard, the AUC of DeepCOVID-XR was 0.95 (95% CI: 0.92, 0.98). CONCLUSION: DeepCOVID-XR, an artificial intelligence algorithm, detected coronavirus disease 2019 on chest radiographs with a performance similar to that of experienced thoracic radiologists in consensus. © RSNA, 2020 Supplemental material is available for this article.

This study aimed to analyze the frequency of the requirement of inappropriately sized uncuffed ETT insertion, air leakage after the ETT was replaced with one of a larger size, and factors associated with air leakage after ETT replacement. METHODS: Patients under 2 years of age who underwent oral surgery under general anesthesia with uncuffed ETTs between December 2013 and May 2015 were enrolled. The ETT size was selected at the discretion of the attending anesthesiologists. A leak test was performed after intubation. The ETT was replaced when considered necessary. Data regarding the leak pressure (PLeak) and inspiratory and expiratory tidal volumes were extracted from anesthesia records. We considered a PLeak of 10 < PLeak ≤ 30 cmH2O to be appropriate. The frequencies of the requirement of inappropriately sized ETTs, absence of leakage after ETT replacement, ETT size difference, and leak rate were calculated. A logistic regression was performed, with PLeak, leak rate, and size difference included as explanatory variables and presence of leakage after replacement as the outcome variable. RESULTS: Out of the 156 patients enrolled, 109 underwent ETT replacement, with the requirement of inappropriately sized ETTs being observed in 25 patients (23%). ETT replacement was performed in patients with PLeak ≤ 10 cmH2O; leakage was absent after replacement (PLeak < 30 cmH2O) in 52% of patients (25/48). In the multivariate logistic model, the leak rate before ETT replacement was significantly associated with the presence of leakage after replacement (p = 0.021). CONCLUSIONS: Inappropriately sized ETTs were inserted in approximately 23% of the patients. The leak rate may be useful to guide ETT replacement.","Hanamoto, Hiroshi; Nakagawa, Hikaru; Niwa, Hitoshi",BMC Anesthesiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33535969/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12871-021-01258-0,244

However, there are challenges for virtual teams – such as reduced informal communication – with implications for team effectiveness. Team flow is a concept with high potential for promoting team effectiveness, however its measurement and promotion are challenging. Traditional team flow measurements rely on self-report questionnaires that require interrupting the team process. Approaches in artificial intelligence, i.e., machine learning, offer methods to identify an algorithm based on behavioral and sensor data that is able to identify team flow and its dynamics over time without interrupting the process. Thus, in this article we present an approach to identify team flow in virtual teams, using machine learning methods. First of all, based on a literature review, we provide a model of team flow characteristics, composed of characteristics that are shared with individual flow and characteristics that are unique for team flow. It is argued that those characteristics that are unique for team flow are represented by the concept of collective communication. Based on that, we present physiological and behavioral correlates of team flow which are suitable – but not limited to – being assessed in virtual teams and which can be used as input data for a machine learning system to assess team flow in real time. Finally, we suggest interventions to support team flow that can be implemented in real time, in virtual environments and controlled by artificial intelligence. This article thus contributes to finding indicators and dynamics of team flow in virtual teams, to stimulate future research and to promote team effectiveness.","Peifer, Corinna; Pollak, Anita; Flak, Olaf; Pyszka, Adrian; Nisar, Muhammad Adeel; Irshad, Muhammad Tausif; Grzegorzek, Marcin; Kordyaka, Bastian; Kożusznik, Barbara",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34566774/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.697093,244

However, biomedical research in ferrets has been hindered by the lack of rapid and cost-effective methods for genome engineering. Here, we utilized CRISPR/Cas9-mediated, homology-independent insertion at the ROSA26 “safe harbor” locus in ferret zygotes and created transgenic animals expressing a dual-fluorescent Cre-reporter system flanked by PhiC31 and Bxb1 integrase attP sites. Out of 151 zygotes injected with circular transgene-containing plasmid and Cas9 protein loaded with the ROSA26 intron-1 sgRNA, there were 23 births of which 5 had targeted integration events (22% efficiency). The encoded tdTomato transgene was highly expressed in all tissues evaluated. Targeted integration was verified by PCR analyses, Southern blot, and germ-line transmission. Function of the ROSA26-CAG-(LoxP)tdTomato(StopLoxP)EGFP (ROSA-TG) Cre-reporter was confirmed in primary cells following Cre expression. The Phi31 and Bxb1 integrase attP sites flanking the transgene will also enable rapid directional insertion of any transgene without a size limitation at the ROSA26 locus.

Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a new type of RNAs, are implicated in viral pathogenesis and host immune responses. However, their dynamic expression patterns and functions during SARS-CoV-2 infection remain to be unclear. We herein performed genome-wide dynamic analysis of circRNAs in human lung epithelial cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 at four time points. A total of 6118 circRNAs were identified at different genomic locations, including 5641 known and 477 novel circRNAs. Notably, a total of 42 circRNAs were significantly dysregulated, wherein 17 were up-regulated and 25 were down-regulated following infection at multiple phases. The gene ontology and KEGG enrichment analyses revealed that the parental genes of circRNAs were mainly involved in immune and inflammatory responses. Further, the RNA binding protein (RBP) prediction analysis indicated that the dysregulated circRNAs could regulate mRNA stability, immunity, cell death by binding specific proteins. Additionally, the circRNA-miRNA-gene network analysis showed that circRNAs indirectly regulated gene expression by absorbing their targeted miRNAs. Collectively, these results shed light on the roles of circRNAs in virus-host interactions, facilitating future studies on SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis.","Yang, Mengmei; Qi, Mengdi; Xu, Liangzi; Huang, Pu; Wang, Xu; Sun, Jing; Shi, Jiandong; Hu, Yunzhang",Infect Genet Evol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34004360/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134821002203; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2021.104923; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134821002203?v=s5,244

A ubiquitous resistance enzyme among Gram-negatives is the aminoglycoside 6′-N-acetyltransferase type Ib [AAC(6′)-Ib], which catalyzes acetylation using acetyl-CoA as a donor substrate. Therapies that combine the antibiotic and an inhibitor of the inactivation reaction could be an alternative to treat infections caused by resistant bacteria. We previously observed that metal ions such as Zn(2+) or Cu(2+) in complex with ionophores interfere with the AAC(6′)-Ib-mediated inactivation of aminoglycosides and reduced resistance to susceptibility levels. Ag(1+) recently attracted attention as a potentiator of aminoglycosides′ action by mechanisms still in discussion. We found that silver acetate is also a robust inhibitor of the enzymatic acetylation mediated by AAC(6′)-Ib in vitro. This action seems to be independent of other mechanisms, like increased production of reactive oxygen species and enhanced membrane permeability, proposed to explain the potentiation of the antibiotic effect by silver ions. The addition of this compound to aac(6′)-Ib harboring Acinetobacter baumannii and Escherichia coli cultures resulted in a dramatic reduction of the resistance levels. Time-kill assays showed that the combination of silver acetate and amikacin was bactericidal and exhibited low cytotoxicity to HEK293 cells.","Reeves, Craig M.; Magallon, Jesus; Rocha, Kenneth; Tran, Tung; Phan, Kimberly; Vu, Peter; Yi, Yang; Oakley-Havens, Crista L.; Cedano, José; Jimenez, Verónica; Ramirez, Maria S.; Tolmasky, Marcelo E.",Antibiotics (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/antibiotics10010029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33396404/,244

Using a standard cycle ergometry ramp protocol, each subject performed a maximal exercise test without a mask, with a surgical mask, and with an N95 respirator. Physiological parameters and time to exhaustion were compared. Each subject served his own control. Sixteen male volunteers (mean age and BMI of 34 ± 4 years and 28.72 ± 3.78 kg/m(2), respectively) completed the protocol. Heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and time to exhaustion did not differ significantly. Exercising with N95 mask was associated with a significant increase in end‐tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO(2)) levels. The differences were more prominent as the load increased, reaching 8 mm Hg at exhaustion (none vs N95, P = .001). In conclusion, in healthy subjects, short‐term moderate‐strenuous aerobic physical activity with a mask is feasible, safe, and associated with only minor changes in physiological parameters, particularly a mild increase in EtCO(2). Subjects suffering from lung diseases should have a cautious evaluation before attempting physical activity with any mask.","Epstein, Danny; Korytny, Alexander; Isenberg, Yoni; Marcusohn, Erez; Zukermann, Robert; Bishop, Boaz; Minha, Sa'ar; Raz, Aeyal; Miller, Asaf",Scand J Med Sci Sports,https://doi.org/10.1111/sms.13832; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32969531/,244
670360,Transplantation of a Severely Traumatized Liver During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Case Report and Review of the Literature,2021,"BACKGROUND: Measuring the seroprevalence of antibodies to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is central to understanding infection risk and fatality rates. We studied Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)-antibody seroprevalence in a community sample drawn from Santa Clara County. METHODS: On 3 and 4 April 2020, we tested 3328 county residents for immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 using a rapid lateral-flow assay (Premier Biotech). Participants were recruited using advertisements that were targeted to reach county residents that matched the county population by gender, race/ethnicity and zip code of residence. We estimate weights to match our sample to the county by zip, age, sex and race/ethnicity. We report the weighted and unweighted prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. We adjust for test-performance characteristics by combining data from 18 independent test-kit assessments: 14 for specificity and 4 for sensitivity. RESULTS: The raw prevalence of antibodies in our sample was 1.5% [exact binomial 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1–2.0%]. Test-performance specificity in our data was 99.5% (95% CI 99.2–99.7%) and sensitivity was 82.8% (95% CI 76.0–88.4%). The unweighted prevalence adjusted for test-performance characteristics was 1.2% (95% CI 0.7–1.8%). After weighting for population demographics, the prevalence was 2.8% (95% CI 1.3–4.2%), using bootstrap to estimate confidence bounds. These prevalence point estimates imply that 53 000 [95% CI 26 000 to 82 000 using weighted prevalence; 23 000 (95% CI 14 000–35 000) using unweighted prevalence] people were infected in Santa Clara County by late March—many more than the ∼1200 confirmed cases at the time. CONCLUSION: The estimated prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Santa Clara County implies that COVID-19 was likely more widespread than indicated by the number of cases in late March, 2020. At the time, low-burden contexts such as Santa Clara County were far from herd-immunity thresholds.","Bendavid, Eran; Mulaney, Bianca; Sood, Neeraj; Shah, Soleil; Bromley-Dulfano, Rebecca; Lai, Cara; Weissberg, Zoe; Saavedra-Walker, Rodrigo; Tedrow, Jim; Bogan, Andrew; Kupiec, Thomas; Eichner, Daniel; Gupta, Ribhav; Ioannidis, John P A; Bhattacharya, Jay",Int J Epidemiol,https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyab010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33615345/,244
670405,Childhood onset exercise addiction or atypical anorexia nervosa during Covid-19: case report,2021-08-09,"BACKGROUND: Residents of long-term care facilities (LTCFs) have been prioritised for COVID-19 vaccination because of the high COVID-19 mortality in this population. Several countries have implemented an extended interval of up to 12 weeks between the first and second vaccine doses to increase population coverage of single-dose vaccination. We aimed to assess the magnitude and quality of adaptive immune responses following a single dose of COVID-19 vaccine in LTCF residents and staff. METHODS: From the LTCFs participating in the ongoing VIVALDI study (ISRCTN14447421), staff and residents who had received a first dose of COVID-19 vaccine (BNT162b2 [tozinameran] or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19), had pre-vaccination and post-vaccination blood samples (collected between Dec 11, 2020, and Feb 16, 2021), and could be linked to a pseudoidentifier in the COVID-19 Data Store were included in our cohort. Past infection with SARS-CoV-2 was defined on the basis of nucleocapsid-specific IgG antibodies being detected through a semiquantitative immunoassay, and participants who tested positive on this assay after but not before vaccination were excluded from the study. Processed blood samples were assessed for spike-specific immune responses, including spike-specific IgG antibody titres, T-cell responses to spike protein peptide mixes, and inhibition of ACE2 binding by spike protein from four variants of SARS-CoV-2 (the original strain as well as the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 variants). Responses before and after vaccination were compared on the basis of age, previous infection status, role (staff or resident), and time since vaccination. FINDINGS: Our cohort comprised 124 participants from 14 LTCFs: 89 (72%) staff (median age 48 years [IQR 35·5–56]) and 35 (28%) residents (87 years [77–90]). Blood samples were collected a median 40 days (IQR 25–47; range 6–52) after vaccination. 30 (24%) participants (18 [20%] staff and 12 [34%] residents) had serological evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. All participants with previous infection had high antibody titres following vaccination that were independent of age (r(s)=0·076, p=0·70). In participants without evidence of previous infection, titres were negatively correlated with age (r(s)=–0·434, p<0·0001) and were 8·2-times lower in residents than in staff. This effect appeared to result from a kinetic delay antibody generation in older infection-naive participants, with the negative age correlation disappearing only in samples taken more than 42 days post-vaccination (r(s)=–0·207, p=0·20; n=40), in contrast to samples taken after 0–21 days (r(s)=–0·774, p=0·0043; n=12) or 22–42 days (r(s)=–0·437, p=0·0034; n=43). Spike-specific cellular responses were similar between older and younger participants. In infection-naive participants, antibody inhibition of ACE2 binding by spike protein from the original SARS-CoV-2 strain was negatively correlated with age (r(s)=–0·439, p<0·0001), and was significantly lower against spike protein from the B.1.351 variant (median inhibition 31% [14–100], p=0·010) and the P.1 variant (23% [14–97], p<0·0001) than against the original strain (58% [27–100]). By contrast, a single dose of vaccine resulted in around 100% inhibition of the spike–ACE2 interaction against all variants in people with a history of infection. INTERPRETATION: History of SARS-CoV-2 infection impacts the magnitude and quality of antibody response after a single dose of COVID-19 vaccine in LTCF residents. Residents who are infection-naive have delayed antibody responses to the first dose of vaccine and should be considered for an early second dose where possible.

670543,Persistent visual dysfunction following posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome due to COVID‐19: Case series and literature review,2021-06-29,"Predicting the outbreak risks and/or the inflection (turning or tipping) points of COVID‐19 can be rather challenging. Here, it is addressed by modeling and simulation approaches guided by classic ecological theories and by treating the COVID‐19 pandemic as a metapopulation dynamics problem. Three classic ecological theories are harnessed, including TPL (Taylor’s power‐law) and Ma’s population aggregation critical density (PACD) for spatiotemporal aggregation/stability scaling, approximating virus metapopulation dynamics with Hubbell’s neutral theory, and Ma’s diversity‐time relationship adapted for the infection−time relationship. Fisher‐Information for detecting critical transitions and tipping points are also attempted. It is discovered that: (i) TPL aggregation/stability scaling parameter (b > 2), being significantly higher than the b‐values of most macrobial and microbial species including SARS, may interpret the chaotic pandemic of COVID‐19. (ii) The infection aggregation critical threshold (M (0)) adapted from PACD varies with time (outbreak‐stage), space (region) and public‐health interventions. Exceeding M (0), local contagions may become aggregated and connected regionally, leading to epidemic/pandemic. (iii) The ratio of fundamental dispersal to contagion numbers can gauge the relative importance between local contagions vs. regional migrations in spreading infections. (iv) The inflection (turning) points, pair of maximal infection number and corresponding time, are successfully predicted in more than 80% of Chinese provinces and 68 countries worldwide, with a precision >80% generally.","Ma, Zhanshan (Sam)",Adv Sci (Weinh),https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202001530; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33042733/,244

Viral infections may predispose pregnant women to a higher rate of pregnancy complications, including preterm births, miscarriage and stillbirth. Despite reports of neonatal COVID-19, definitive proof of vertical transmission is still lacking. In this review, we summarize studies regarding the potential evidence for transplacental transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), characterize the expression of its receptors and proteases, describe the placental pathology and analyze virus-host interactions at the maternal-fetal interface. We focus on the syncytium, the barrier between mother and fetus, and describe in detail its physical and structural defense against viral infections. We further discuss the potential molecular mechanisms, whereby the placenta serves as a defense front against pathogens by regulating the interferon type III signaling, microRNA-triggered autophagy and the nuclear factor-κB pathway. Based on these data, we conclude that vertical transmission may occur but rare, ascribed to the potent physical barrier, the fine-regulated placental immune defense and modulation strategies. Particularly, immunomodulatory mechanisms employed by the placenta may mitigate violent immune response, maybe soften cytokine storm tightly associated with severely ill COVID-19 patients, possibly minimizing cell and tissue damages, and potentially reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","Kreis, Nina-Naomi; Ritter, Andreas; Louwen, Frank; Yuan, Juping",Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32722449/; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells9081777,244

Concerning the Article Entitled ‘‘Guillain Barre syndrome associated with COVID-19 infection: A case report”,2020-07-04,"Background: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), prompted a global health crisis, with no available specific treatments. Convalescent plasma (CP) with neutralizing antibodies could be a promising therapeutic approach to reduce mortality. Objectives: To evaluate the therapeutic potential of CP for COVID-19 and to assess its safety and efficacy in reducing the patients' mortality. Methods: We retrieved clinical trial references from multiple Databases (e.g., PubMed, B-On, SCOPUS), for complete studies until November 26th 2020. We included Randomized controlled trials (RCT) and controlled non-randomized trials (CNRT), that assessed the efficacy of CP to treat hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Trials were included regardless of concomitant medications in the intervention's arms. Eleven trials met our eligibility criteria. This study was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We defined a methodological protocol to extract and evaluate all pertinent baseline demographics and interventions' characteristics from trials. The primary outcomes were the safety profile of CP, measured by the type, frequency and severity of adverse events, and CP effectiveness in reducing mortality, measured by the number of deaths registered for this therapy. Results: We assessed 11 trials (5 RCT and 6 CNRT) with 3,098 participants, of whom 923 patients were treated with CP. Only 32 (3.5%) of the treated patients suffered adverse events (from which 9.4% serious transfusion-related adverse events). The overall mortality rates were significantly decreased by CP administration {risk ratio (RR) 0.71, p = 0.005, 95% confidence interval (Cl) [0.57–0.90]}, with low heterogeneity. In the sub-analysis by period of transfusion, CP transfusion within a week of hospitalization contributed to diminished mortality rate (RR = 0.71, p = 0.03, 95%Cl [0.53–0.96]). CP therapy also led to significantly reduced viral loads at 72 h after transfusion (RR = 0.61, p = 0.04, 95%Cl [0.38–0.98]), despite high heterogeneity due to disease severity. Conclusion: This meta-analysis established CP as a safe and potentially effective therapy for COVID-19, decreasing the mortality rates and promoting a swift viral clearance. Further studies are necessary to provide stronger evidence.","Barreira, Daniela Ferreira; Lourenço, Rita Adubeiro; Calisto, Rita; Moreira-Gonçalves, Daniel; Santos, Lúcio Lara; Videira, Paula Alexandra",Front Med (Lausanne),https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.660688; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33889590/,244

Several e-learning modules have been developed by Uppsala Monitoring Centre (UMC). With distance learners and technological challenges such as poor internet bandwidth to be considered, UMC opted for the microlearning approach based on small learning units connected to specific learning objectives. The aim of this study was to evaluate how this e-learning course was received. METHODS: The course was evaluated through usage data and the results of two user surveys, one for modules 1–4, signal detection and causality assessment, and the other for module 5, statistical reasoning and algorithms in pharmacovigilance. The evaluation model used was based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). A questionnaire was developed, divided into demographic profile, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, educational compatibility and behavioural intention. The two surveys were disseminated to 2067 learners for modules 1–4 and 1685 learners for module 5. RESULTS: Learners from 137 countries participated, predominantly from industry (36.6%), national pharmacovigilance centres (22.6%) and academia (16.3%). The overall satisfaction level was very high for all modules, with over 90% of the learners rating it as either ‘excellent’ or ‘good’. The majority were satisfied with the learning platform, the course content and the lesson duration. Most learners thought they would be able to apply the knowledge in practice. Almost 100% of the learners would recommend the modules to others and would also study future modules. Suggested improvements were an interactive forum, more practical examples in the lessons and practical exercises. CONCLUSION: This e-learning course in pharmacovigilance based on microlearning was well received with a global coverage among relevant professional disciplines.

Conventional methods for serological testing, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and chemiluminescence immunoassays, provide reliable and sensitive antibody detection but require sophisticated laboratory infrastructure and/or lengthy assay time. Conversely, lateral flow immunoassays are suitable for rapid point-of-care tests but have limited sensitivity. Here, we describe the development of a rapid and sensitive magnetofluidic immuno-PCR platform that can address the current gap in point-of-care serological testing for COVID-19. Our magnetofluidic immuno-PCR platform automates a magnetic bead-based, single-binding, and one-wash immuno-PCR assay in a palm-sized magnetofluidic device and delivers results in ∼30 min. In the device, a programmable magnetic arm attracts and transports magnetically-captured antibodies through assay reagents pre-loaded in a companion plastic cartridge, and a miniaturized thermocycler and a fluorescence detector perform immuno-PCR to detect the antibodies. We evaluated our magnetofluidic immuno-PCR with 108 clinical serum samples and achieved 93.8% (45/48) sensitivity and 98.3% (59/60) specificity, demonstrating its potential as a rapid and sensitive point-of-care serological test for COVID-19.","Zhang, Pengfei; Chen, Liben; Hu, Jiumei; Trick, Alexander Y.; Chen, Fan-En; Hsieh, Kuangwen; Zhao, Yang; Coleman, Branch; Kruczynski, Kate; Pisanic, Thomas R.; Heaney, Christopher D.; Clarke, William A.; Wang, Tza-Huei",Biosens Bioelectron,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2021.113656; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S095656632100693X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095656632100693X?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34600203/,244

674393,Elevation of Liver Fibrosis Index FIB-4 Is Associated With Poor Clinical Outcomes in Patients With COVID-19,2020-06-21,"BACKGROUND: Predicting bed occupancy for hospitalised patients with COVID-19 requires understanding of length of stay (LoS) in particular bed types. LoS can vary depending on the patient’s “bed pathway” - the sequence of transfers of individual patients between bed types during a hospital stay. In this study, we characterise these pathways, and their impact on predicted hospital bed occupancy. METHODS: We obtained data from University College Hospital (UCH) and the ISARIC4C COVID-19 Clinical Information Network (CO-CIN) on hospitalised patients with COVID-19 who required care in general ward or critical care (CC) beds to determine possible bed pathways and LoS. We developed a discrete-time model to examine the implications of using either bed pathways or only average LoS by bed type to forecast bed occupancy. We compared model-predicted bed occupancy to publicly available bed occupancy data on COVID-19 in England between March and August 2020. RESULTS: In both the UCH and CO-CIN datasets, 82% of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 only received care in general ward beds. We identified four other bed pathways, present in both datasets: “Ward, CC, Ward”, “Ward, CC”, “CC” and “CC, Ward”. Mean LoS varied by bed type, pathway, and dataset, between 1.78 and 13.53 days. For UCH, we found that using bed pathways improved the accuracy of bed occupancy predictions, while only using an average LoS for each bed type underestimated true bed occupancy. However, using the CO-CIN LoS dataset we were not able to replicate past data on bed occupancy in England, suggesting regional LoS heterogeneities. CONCLUSIONS: We identified five bed pathways, with substantial variation in LoS by bed type, pathway, and geography. This might be caused by local differences in patient characteristics, clinical care strategies, or resource availability, and suggests that national LoS averages may not be appropriate for local forecasts of bed occupancy for COVID-19.

Antibodies were screened on HEK293 cells transfected with viral nucleoprotein, S1 subunit and S2 subunit of spike protein and on untransfected cells, as well as a panel of normal tissue. Lung tissue with presence of SARS-CoV2 confirmed by in situ hybridization (ISH) was also used. A total of 7 mAbs were tested: (1) mAb 001 (Sino Biological, 40143-R001), (2) mAb 007 (Sino Biological, 40150-R007), (3) mAb 019 (Sino Biological, 40143-R019), (4) mAb 1A9 (GeneTex, GTX632604), (5) mAb ABM19C9 (Abeomics, 10-10007), (6) FIPV3-70 (Santa Cruz, SC-65653), and (7) mAb 6F10 (BioVision, A2060). Only 2 mAbs, clone 001 to the nucleoprotein and clone 1A9 to the S2 subunit spike protein displayed specific immunoreactivity. Both clones showed strong staining in the acute phase of COVID-19 pneumonia, mostly in areas of acute diffuse alveolar damage, but were not completely congruent.

For a proportion of hospitalized patients, death can occur within a few days, mainly for adult respiratory distress syndrome or multi-organ dysfunction syndrome. In these patients, clinical signs and symptoms, as well as laboratory abnormalities, suggest a cytokine storm syndrome in response to the viral infection. No current targeted treatment is yet available for COVID-19, an unknown disease up to 2 months ago, which challenges doctors and researchers to find new drugs or reallocate other treatments for these patients. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, a growing body of information on diagnostic and therapeutic strategies has emerged, mainly based on preliminary experience on retrospective studies or small case series. Antivirals, antimalarials, corticosteroids, biotechnological and small molecules, convalescent plasma and anticoagulants are among the drugs proposed for the treatment or in tested for COVID-19. Given the complexity of this new condition, a multidisciplinary management seems to be the best approach. Sharing and integrating knowledge between specialists, to evaluate the correct timing and setting of every treatment, could greatly benefit our patients. We reviewed the literature, combining it with our experiences and our specialist knowledge, to propose a management algorithm, correlating the clinical features with laboratory and imaging findings to establish the right timing for each treatment.","Galluccio, Felice; Ergonenc, Tolga; Garcia Martos, Alvaro; Allam, Abdallah El-Sayed; Pérez-Herrero, Maria; Aguilar, Ricardo; Emmi, Giacomo; Spinicci, Michele; Terrancle Juan, Ignacio; Fajardo-Pérez, Mario",Clin Rheumatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32472459/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10067-020-05179-0,244
677163,Trigeminal neuralgia as the sole neurological manifestation of COVID‐19: A case report,2021-03-22,"It has tremendous values for both drug discovery and basic research to develop a solid bioinformatical tool for guiding peptide reagent design. Based on the physical and chemical properties of amino acids, a new strategy for peptide reagent design, the so‐called AABPD (amino acid based‐peptide design), is proposed. The peptide samples in a training dataset are described by a series of HMLP (heuristic molecular lipophilicity potential) parameters and other physicochemical properties of amino acid residues that form a three‐dimensional data matrix where each component is defined by three indexes: the first index refers to the peptide samples, the second to the amino acid positions, and the third to the amino acid parameters. The binding free energy between a peptide ligand and its protein receptor is calculated by a linear free energy equation through the physicochemical parameters, resulting in a set of simultaneous linear equations between the bioactivity of the peptides and the physicochemical properties of amino acids. An iterative double least square technique is developed for the solution of the three‐dimensional simultaneous linear equation set to determine the amino acid position coefficients of peptide sequence and the physicochemical parameter coefficients of amino acid residues alternately. The two sets of coefficients thus obtained are used for predicting the bioactivity of other query peptide reagents. Two calculation examples, the peptide substrate specificity of the SARS coronavirus 3C‐like proteinase and the affinity prediction for epitope‐peptides with Class I MHC molecules are studied by using the peptide reagent design strategy. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We aimed to validate and/or improve the performance of CALL score in our hospital settings. METHODS: Adult patients with polymerase chain reaction‐confirmed COVID‐19 were included in this retrospective observational study. Clinical and laboratory characteristics (including complete blood count, CRP, ferritin, LDH, fibrinogen, d‐dimer) were obtained. ROC analysis was used for the evaluation of CALL score's performance. Cox regression analyses were performed for the selection of new parameters for improving CALL score. RESULTS: Overall, 256 patients were enrolled in the study. The median age was 54 (IQR, 22.5), 134 (52%) were women, 155 (61%) had at least one comorbidity, 60 (23%) had severe disease. The AUC value for CALL score for predicting progression to severe COVID‐19 was 0.59 (95% CI 0.50‐0.66). D‐dimer on admission was associated with progressive disease (HR = 1.2 CI 95% 1.02‐1.40), (P < .027). CONCLUSION: The performance of the CALL score in our patient population was low compared with the original study. We found an additional parameter for predicting progressive COVID‐19 disease, D‐dimer, which may guide future studies to develop new scoring systems for predicting progressive disease.","Erturk Sengel, Buket; Tukenmez Tigen, Elif; Ilgin, Can; Basari, Tugce; Bedir, Merve; Odabasi, Zekaver; Korten, Volkan",Int J Clin Pract,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.14642; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34310000/,244

We identified and analysed the amino acid mutations that gained prominence worldwide in the early months of the pandemic. Eight mutations have been identified along the viral genome, mostly located in conserved segments of the structural proteins and showing low variability among coronavirus, which indicated that they might have a functional impact. At the moment of writing this paper, these mutations present a varied success in the SARS-CoV-2 virus population; ranging from a change in the spike protein that becomes absolutely prevalent, two mutations in the nucleocapsid protein showing frequencies around 25%, to a mutation in the matrix protein that nearly fades out after reaching a frequency of 20%.","Cortey, Martí; Li, Yanli; Díaz, Ivan; Clilverd, Hepzibar; Darwich, Laila; Mateu, Enric",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.16.099499,244

Being a large, multidomain, transmembrane protein, Nsp3 has been the most challenging Nsp to characterize. Encoded within Nsp3 is the papain-like protease domain (PLpro) that cleaves not only the viral polypeptide but also K48-linked polyubiquitin and the ubiquitin-like modifier, ISG15, from host cell proteins. We here compare the interactors of PLpro and Nsp3 and find a largely overlapping interactome. Intriguingly, we find that near full length Nsp3 is a more active protease compared to the minimal catalytic domain of PLpro. Using a MALDI-TOF based assay, we screen 1971 approved clinical compounds and identify five compounds that inhibit PLpro with IC(50)s in the low micromolar range but showed cross reactivity with other human deubiquitinases and had no significant antiviral activity in cellular SARS-CoV-2 infection assays. We therefore looked for alternative methods to block PLpro activity and engineered competitive nanobodies that bind to PLpro at the substrate binding site with nanomolar affinity thus inhibiting the enzyme. Our work highlights the importance of studying Nsp3 and provides tools and valuable insights to investigate Nsp3 biology during the viral infection cycle.","Armstrong, Lee A.; Lange, Sven M.; Dee Cesare, Virginia; Matthews, Stephen P.; Nirujogi, Raja Sekhar; Cole, Isobel; Hope, Anthony; Cunningham, Fraser; Toth, Rachel; Mukherjee, Rukmini; Bojkova, Denisa; Gruber, Franz; Gray, David; Wyatt, Paul G.; Cinatl, Jindrich; Dikic, Ivan; Davies, Paul; Kulathu, Yogesh",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253364; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34270554/,244

The present study investigates the longitudinal effects of subjective successful aging on middle-aged and older adults’ emotional and coping responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, and explores an underlying mechanism through perceived time limitation during the pandemic. METHODS: A sample of 311 Hong Kong Chinese middle-aged and older adults (M(age) = 64.58, SD = 10.14, Range = 45–90 years) were recruited from an Adult Development and Aging Project and participated in a questionnaire study via an online platform or phone interview. Their levels of subjective successful aging, perceived time limitation, and emotional and coping responses to the pandemic were measured. RESULTS: The respondents who perceived themselves as more successful in aging process reported more positive and fewer negative emotions compared with their counterparts with lower levels of subjective successful aging. The mediation analysis showed that perceived time limitation could partially account for the effects of subjective successful aging on emotional and coping responses.

Its efficient transmission and range of disease severity raise questions regarding the contributions of virus-receptor interactions. ACE2 is a host ectopeptidase and the receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Numerous reports describe ACE2 mRNA abundance and tissue distribution; however, mRNA abundance is not always representative of protein levels. Currently, there is limited data evaluating ACE2 protein and its correlation with other SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We systematically examined the human upper and lower respiratory tract using single-cell RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry to determine receptor expression and evaluated its association with risk factors for severe COVID-19. FINDINGS: Our results reveal that ACE2 protein is highest within regions of the sinonasal cavity and pulmonary alveoli, sites of presumptive viral transmission and severe disease development, respectively. In the lung parenchyma, ACE2 protein was found on the apical surface of a small subset of alveolar type II cells and colocalized with TMPRSS2, a cofactor for SARS-CoV2 entry. ACE2 protein was not increased by pulmonary risk factors for severe COVID-19. Additionally, ACE2 protein was not reduced in children, a demographic with a lower incidence of severe COVID-19.

Randomised data in mild-moderate disease are lacking. We assessed whether azithromycin is effective in reducing hospitalisation in patients with mild-moderate COVID-19. Methods This open-label, randomised superiority clinical trial at 19 centres in the United Kingdom enrolled adults, [≥]18 years, presenting to hospitals with clinically-diagnosed highly-probable or confirmed COVID-19 infection, with <14 days symptoms, considered suitable for initial ambulatory management. Patients were randomised (1:1) to azithromycin (500 mg daily orally for 14 days) or to standard care without macrolides. The primary outcome was the difference in proportion of participants with death or hospital admission from any cause over the 28 days from randomisation, assessed according to intention-to-treat (ITT). Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04381962, Study closed. Findings 298 participants were enrolled from 3rd June 2020 to 29th January 2021. The primary outcome was assessed in 292 participants. The primary endpoint was not significantly different between the azithromycin and control groups (Adjusted OR 0.91 [95% CI 0.43-1.92], p=0.80). Rates of respiratory failure, progression to pneumonia, all-cause mortality, and adverse events, including serious cardiovascular events, were not significantly different between groups. Interpretation In patients with mild-moderate COVID-19 managed without hospital admission, adding azithromycin to standard care treatment did not reduce the risk of subsequent hospitalisation or death.

682083,A Rare Presentation of Cerebrovascular Accident in a COVID-19 Patient: A Case Report,2020-12-25,"OBJECTIVES: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a tremendous impact on public health and socioeconomic conditions globally. Although non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as social distancing effectively reduced the incidence of COVID-19, especially in Korea, demand for vaccination has increased to minimize the social costs of NPIs. This study estimated the potential benefits of COVID-19 vaccination in Korea. METHODS: A mathematical model with vaccinated–susceptible–latent–infectious–recovered compartments was used to simulate the COVID-19 epidemic. The compartments were stratified into age groups of 0-19 years, 20-59 years, and 60 years or older. Based on the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency national vaccination plan for the second quarter of 2021, announced on March 15, we developed vaccination scenarios (with 150,000 dose/d and 100% compliance as the main scenario). Comparing scenarios without vaccination or with higher/lower vaccination rates and compliance, we estimated the numbers of COVID-19 cases that will be prevented by vaccination. RESULTS: The results projected 203,135 cases within a year after April 2021 without vaccination, which would be reduced to 71,248 (64.9% decrease) by vaccination. Supposing a vaccination rate of 150,000 dose/d and 100% compliance, social distancing interventions for those aged 20 or more can be retracted after January 1, 2022. CONCLUSIONS: We expect COVID-19 vaccination to be effective in Korea. Health authorities should minimize delays in vaccination and vaccine avoidance to maximize the effectiveness of vaccination and end social distancing early.","Min, Kyung-Duk; Tak, Sangwoo",Epidemiol Health,https://doi.org/10.4178/epih.e2021040; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34082498/,244
682512,COVID-19 PRESENTING WITH DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS: A CASE SERIES,2020-12-28,"BACKGROUND: Persistent symptoms including breathlessness, fatigue and decreased exercise tolerance have been reported in patients after acute SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. The biological mechanisms underlying this ‘Long COVID’ syndrome remain unknown. However, autopsy studies have highlighted the key roles played by pulmonary endotheliopathy and microvascular immunothrombosis in acute COVID‐19. We hypothesized that endothelial cell activation may be sustained in convalescent COVID‐19 patients and contribute to Long COVID pathogenesis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty patients were reviewed at a median of 68 days following SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. In addition to clinical workup, acute phase markers, EC activation and NETosis parameters and thrombin generation were assessed. RESULTS: Thrombin generation assays revealed significantly shorter lag times (p<0.0001, 95% CI ‐2.57– ‐1.02min), increased endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) (p=0.04, 95% CI 15–416nM/min) and peak thrombin (p<0.0001, 95% CI 39–93nM) in convalescent COVID‐19 patients. These pro‐thrombotic changes were independent of ongoing acute phase response or active NETosis. Importantly, EC biomarkers including VWF:Ag, VWF propeptide (VWFpp) and Factor VIII (FVIII:C) were significantly elevated in convalescent COVID‐19 compared to controls (p=0.004, 95% CI 0.09–0.57IU/ml; p=0.009, 95% CI 0.06–0.5IU/ml; p=0.04, 95% CI 0.03–0.44IU/ml, respectively). In addition, plasma soluble thrombomodulin (sTM) levels were significantly elevated in convalescent COVID‐19 (p=0.02, 95% CI 0.01–2.7ng/ml). Sustained endotheliopathy was more frequent in older, comorbid patients and those requiring hospitalization. Finally, both plasma VWF:Ag and VWFpp levels correlated inversely with 6‐minute walk tests. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our findings demonstrate that sustained endotheliopathy is common in convalescent COVID‐19 and raise the intriguing possibility that this may contribute to Long COVID pathogenesis.","Fogarty, Helen; Townsend, Liam; Morrin, Hannah; Ahmad, Azaz; Comerford, Claire; Karampini, Ellie; Englert, Hanna; Byrne, Mary; Bergin, Colm; O’Sullivan, Jamie M.; Martin‐Loeches, Ignacio; Nadarajan, Parthiban; Bannan, Ciaran; Mallon, Patrick W.; Curley, Gerard F.; Preston, Roger J.S.; Rehill, Aisling M.; McGonagle, Dennis; Ni Cheallaigh, Cliona; Baker, Ross I.; Renné, Thomas; Ward, Soracha E.; O’ Donnell, James S.",J Thromb Haemost,https://doi.org/10.1111/jth.15490; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34375505/,244

Nurse participants were from two SARS units (regular SARS [N = 44] and SARS ICU [N = 26]) and two non-SARS units (Neurology [N = 15] and CCU [N = 17]). Participants periodically self-evaluated their depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress symptoms, sleep disturbance, attitude towards SARS and family support. Results showed that depression (38.5% vs. 3.1%) and insomnia (37% vs. 9.7%) were, respectively, greater in the SARS unit nurses than the non-SARS unit nurses. No difference between these two groups was found in the prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptoms (33% vs. 18.7%), yet, three unit subjects (SARS ICU, SARS regular and Neurology) had significantly higher rate than those in CCU (29.7% vs. 11.8%, respectively) (p < 0.05). For the SARS unit nurses, significant reduction in mood ratings, insomnia rate and perceived negative feelings as well as increasing knowledge and understanding of SARS at the end of the study (all p < 0.001) indicated that a gradual psychological adaptation had occurred. The adjustment of nurses in the more structured SARS ICU environment, where nurses care for even more severely ill patients, may have been as good or better than that of nurses in the regular SARS unit. Occurrence of psychiatric symptoms was linked to direct exposure to SARS patient care, previous mood disorder history, younger age and perceived negative feelings. Positive coping attitude and strong social and family support may have protected against acute stress. In conclusion, the psychological impact on the caring staffs facing future bio-disaster will be minimized with lowered risk factors and a safer and more structured work environment.","Su, Tung-Ping; Lien, Te-Cheng; Yang, Chih-Yi; Su, Yiet Ling; Wang, Jia-Horng; Tsai, Sing-Ling; Yin, Jeo-Chen",J Psychiatr Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022395605001561; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022395605001561; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16460760/,244

684610,Hypopharyngeal Ulcers in COVID-19: Histopathological and Virological Analyses – A Case Report,2021-07-05,"Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4is) have gained a key place in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) essentially because of their good safety profile even in the frail population. DPP-4, originally known as ‘T-cell antigen CD26’, is expressed in many immune cells and regulates their functions, so the initial concern over the use of DPP-4is was the possible increased susceptibility to infections. Furthermore, because of the high affinity between human DPP-4 and the spike (S) receptor-binding domain of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), it was suspected that this virus, responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), might be able to use the DPP-4 enzyme as a functional receptor to gain entry into the host. However, DPP-4is also exert anti-inflammatory effects, which could be beneficial in patients exposed to cytokine storms due to COVID-19. Yet, when observational (mostly retrospective) studies compared clinical outcomes in DPP-4i users vs non-users among diabetes patients with COVID-19, the overall results regarding the risk of progression towards more severe forms of the disease and mortality were heterogeneous, thereby precluding any definite conclusions. Nevertheless, new expectations have arisen following recent reports of significant reductions in admissions to intensive care units and mortality in DPP-4i users. However, given the limitations inherent in such observational studies, any available results should be considered, at best, as hypothetical and only suggestive of potentially substantial benefits with DPP-4is in diabetes patients with COVID-19. While the safe use of DPP-4is in COVID-19 patients appears to be an acceptable hypothesis, all such positive findings still need to be confirmed in randomized controlled trials (a few of which are currently ongoing) before any recommendations can be made for clinical practice.","Scheen, André J.",Diabetes Metab,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diabet.2020.11.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1262363620301786?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1262363620301786; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33249199/,244

Many studies reported that the air quality had improved much due to the lockdown. This study examines the variation of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) over the Indian metropolitan cities during the lockdown period by using ground-based and satellite observations. Ground-based BTEX (Benzene, Toluene, Ethylbenzene, and Xylenes) measurements from various metropolitan cities have shown a drastic drop of about 82% in the first phase of lockdown when compared with the pre-lockdown period. Whereas the spatial distribution of formaldehyde (HCHO), obtained from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) onboard Sentinal-5P satellite, did not show any significant variation due to COVID-19 lockdown, indicating the major source of HCHO is biogenic or pyrogenic. The BTEX ratios were evaluated for a better understanding of the source and photochemical age of the air samples. The ozone forming potential of BTEX in all locations was found reduced; however, the corresponding decrease in ozone concentrations was not observed. The increase in ozone concentrations during the same period indicates alternative sources contributing to ozone formation.","Pakkattil, Anoop; Muhsin, M.; Varma, M.K.

This study aimed to assess commuting in Bogotá by (1) analyzing the gender-specific trend of the standardized number of bicycle commuters during 2005–2017; and (2) assessing the socio-demographic, community, built-environment and natural factors associated with bicycle commuting stratified by gender. This secondary-data analysis included data from the Household Travel Surveys and Multipurpose Surveys to calculate the number of bicycle commuters per habitant from 2005 to 2017 by gender. We assessed the socio-demographic and built-environment factors fitting generalized additive models stratified by gender using the 2015 Household Travel Survey. Although both women and men increased the standardized number of bicycle commuters, male commuters show a steeper trend than women, evidencing the widening gender gap in bicycle commuting over time. Bicycle commuting was negatively associated with household motor vehicle ownership, steeper terrain slope, longer commute distance, and scarce low-stress roads at trip origin and route. Among women, the availability of bike paths at the trip destination was positively associated with bicycling, while age and being a student were negatively associated with bicycling. Among men, living in areas with the lowest socio-economic status was positively associated with bicycling, while having a driver's license and living close to bus rapid transit stations were negatively associated with bicycling. In conclusion, bicycle and transport infrastructure play different roles in commuting by bicycle by gender and trip stages (origin – route – destination).","Higuera-Mendieta, Diana; Uriza, Pablo Andrés; Cabrales, Sergio A.; Medaglia, Andrés L.; Guzman, Luis A.; Sarmiento, Olga L.",J Transp Geogr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34305337/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2021.103120,244

During movement control, measures comprising physical distancing, hand cleaning or sanitizing, and sanitization of premises are consistently implemented while self-isolation and travel restrictions are adaptively enforced. This study aims to examine if the control of COVID-19 transmission has an effect on the national influenza occurrences as some measures for COVID-19 control are similar to those for influenza. Study design This study drew the data of weekly new cases of influenza and COVID-19 from official platforms for non-parametric statistical analysis. Methods This study compared the influenza occurrences before and after the onset of COVID-19 using the Mann-Whitney U Test and explored the Spearman’s correlations between COVID-19 and influenza incidences after the onset of COVID-19. Results It shows that influenza incidences before and after the onset of COVID-19 were significantly different where influenza cases have significantly reduced after the onset of COVID-19. The weekly cases of influenza and COVID-19 were significantly and negatively correlated.

Voice parameters and quality changes are usually secondary towards functional and/or structural laryngological alterations under specific systemic processes, syndrome and pathologies. These include but are not restricted to dry mouth and Sicca syndromes, body dehydration, hormonal alterations linked to pubertal, menopausal, and andropausal status, respiratory disorders, gastrointestinal reflux, autoimmune diseases, endocrinologic disorders, underweight versus overweight and obesity, and diabetes mellitus. On the other hand, it is well-established that stress overload is a significant risk factor of cascading pathologies, including but not restricted to neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and cancers. Our current study revealed voice perturbations under the stress overload as a potentially useful biomarker to identify individuals in suboptimal health conditions who might be strongly predisposed to associated pathologies. Contextually, extended surveys applied in the population might be useful to identify, for example, persons at high risk for respiratory complications under pandemic conditions such as COVID-19. Symptoms of dry mouth syndrome, disturbed microcirculation, altered sense regulation, shifted circadian rhythm, and low BMI were positively associated with voice perturbations under the stress overload. Their functional interrelationships and relevance for cascading associated pathologies are presented in the article. Automated analysis of voice recordings via artificial intelligence (AI) has a potential to derive digital biomarkers. Further, predictive machine learning models should be developed that allows for detecting a suboptimal health condition based on voice recordings, ideally in an automated manner using derived digital biomarkers. Follow-up stratification and monitoring of individuals in suboptimal health conditions are recommended using disease-specific cell-free nucleic acids (ccfDNA, ctDNA, mtDNA, miRNA) combined with metabolic patterns detected in body fluids. Application of the cost-effective targeted prevention within the phase of reversible health damage is recommended based on the individualised patient profiling.","Kunin, A.; Sargheini, N.; Birkenbihl, C.; Moiseeva, N.; Fröhlich, Holger; Golubnitschaja, Olga",EPMA J,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13167-020-00229-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33200009/,244

A total of 336 non-duplicated residual serum samples that were obtained from COVID-19 confirmed patients (n=173) on PCR and negative controls (n=163) obtained pre-December 2019 before the COVID-19 pandemic were used for the study. These were concurrently analysed on the different immunoassay platforms and correlated with clinical characteristics. Our results showed all assays had specificity ranging from 99.3% to 100.0%. Overall sensitivity across all days of symptoms, in descending order were OCD (49.1%, 95% CI 41.8–56.5%), cPass (44.8%, 95% CI 37.5–52.3%), Roche (41.6%, 95% CI 34.5–49.0%), Siemens (39.9%, 95% CI 32.9–47.3%), Abbott (39.8%, 95% CI 32.9–47.3%) and Beckman (39.6%, 95% CI 32.5–47.3%). Testing after at least 14 days from symptom onset is required to achieve AUCs greater than 0.80. OCD and cPass performed the best in terms of sensitivity for >21 days symptoms with 93.3% (95% CI, 73.5–99.2%) and 96.7% (95% CI, 82.8–99.9%), respectively.

689223,COVID-19 quarantine in chronic kidney disease patients: A focus on sarcopenia traits,2021-03-22,"RATIONALE OBJECTIVE: During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, New York encountered shortages in continuous kidney replacement (CKRT) capacity for critically ill patients with acute kidney injury stage 3 requiring dialysis (AKI 3D). To inform planning for current and future crises, we estimated CKRT demand and capacity during the initial wave of the US COVID-19 pandemic. STUDY DESIGN: We developed mathematical models to project nationwide and statewide CKRT demand and capacity. Data sources included the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) model, the Harvard Global Health Institute model, and published literature. SETTING: Population: US patients hospitalized during the initial wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (02/06/2020 to 08/04/2020). INTERVENTION: CKRT. OUTCOMES: CKRT demand and capacity at peak resource utilization; number of states projected to encounter CKRT shortages. Model, Perspective, & Timeframe: Health sector perspective with a 6-month time horizon. RESULTS: Under base-case model assumptions, there was a nationwide CKRT capacity of 7,032 machines, an estimated shortage of 1,088 (95% uncertainty interval: 910-1,568) machines, and shortages in 6 states at peak resource utilization. In sensitivity analyses, varying assumptions around (1) the number of pre-COVID-19 surplus CKRT machines available and (2) the incidence of AKI 3D requiring CKRT among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 resulted in projected shortages in 3-8 states (933-1,282 machines) and 4-8 states (945-1,723 machines), respectively. In the best-case and worst-case scenarios, there were shortages in 3 and 26 states (614 and 4,540 machines). LIMITATIONS: Parameter estimates are influenced by assumptions made in the absence of published data on CKRT capacity and by the IHME model’s limitations. CONCLUSIONS: Several US states are projected to encounter CKRT shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings – while based on limited data on CKRT demand and capacity – suggest there being value during health care crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic in establishing an inpatient kidney replacement therapy national registry and maintaining a national stockpile of CKRT equipment.

689430,Urban noise measurements in the City of Buenos Aires during the mandatory quarantinea),2020-11-11,"Abstract The advent of the COVID-19 pandemic has enhanced the complexities of plastic waste management. Our improved, hyper-hygienic way of life in the fear of transmission has conveniently shifted our behavioral patterns like the use of PPE (Personal protective equipment), increased demand for plastic-packaged food and groceries, and the use of disposable utensils. The inadequacies and inefficiencies of our current waste management system to deal with our increased dependence on plastic could aggravate its mismanagement and leakage into the environment, thus triggering an environmental crisis. Mandating scientific sterilization and the use of sealed bags for safe disposal of contaminated plastic wastes should be an immediate priority to reduce the risk of transmission to sanitation workers. Investments in circular technologies like feedstock recycling along with improving the infrastructure and environmental viability of existing techniques could be the key to dealing with the plastic waste fluxes during a crisis. Transition towards environmentally friendly materials like bioplastics and harboring new sustainable technologies would be crucial to fighting future pandemics. Although the rollbacks and relaxation of single-use plastic bans may be temporary, their likely implications on the consumer perception could hinder our long-term goals of transitioning towards a circular economy. Likewise, any delay in building international willingness and participation to curb any form of pollution through summits and agendas may also delay its implementation. Reduction in plastic pollution and inclusive, sustainable plastic waste management can be achieved by restructuring our policies to instill individual behavioral as well as social, institutional changes. Incentivizing measures that encourage circularity and sustainable practices, public-private investments in research and infrastructure would help in bringing the aforementioned changes. Individual responsibility, corporate action, and government policy are all necessary to keep us from transiting from one disaster to another.","Vanapalli, Kumar Raja; Sharma, Hari Bhakta; Ranjan, Ved Prakash; Samal, Biswajit; Bhattacharya, Jayanta; Dubey, Brajesh K.; Goel, Sudha",Sci Total Environ,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720350439?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32835961/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141514; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720350439,244

Reduced in-person clinic exposures and social distancing requirements have significantly affected trainee education. Similar to programs around the USA, in early March 2020, our program was faced with an urgent need to pivot both our clinical and educational programs to virtual platforms. Within these limitations, we harnessed innovative educational models and restructured our curriculum to ensure adequate clinical and didactic exposure. We divided trainee’s clinical rotations into four blocks, which include Inpatient consult service, Outpatient in-person and procedure clinics, Telehealth Clinics and Research/Elective week. By assigning specific rotations, we were able to ensure fellows were seeing adequate numbers of patients both through telemedicine and inperson while ensuring we complied with social distancing requirements. We further were able to ensure that trainee hands-on procedure training was not compromised. Acknowledging challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic and learner engagement in virtual environment, we designed an innovative educational portfolio. Utilizing synchronous and asynchronous learning methods, we have developed multiple complementary educational initiatives including: Rocket Rheumatology, Board Games, At the Elbow, Radiology Reading Rheum, Ultrasound Buddies, The History Rheum, and Rapid-Fire Journal Club. Virtual learning methods will become a cornerstone of medical education moving forwards. The GW Division of Rheumatology has rapidly incorporated innovative educational tools into our curriculum.

This paper sets out a hypothetical case of Patient X (who is a nurse) and Patient Y (who is a non‐health care worker). They are both in need of a ventilator due to COVID‐19 with the same clinical situation and expected outcomes. However, there is only one ventilator available. In addressing the question of who should get priority, the proposal is made that the answer may lie in how the pandemic is metaphorically described using military terms. If nursing is understood to take place at the ‘frontline’ in the ‘battle’ against COVID‐19, a principle of military medical ethics—namely the principle of salvage—can offer guidance on how to prioritise access to a life‐saving resource in such a situation. This principle of salvage purports a moral direction to return wounded soldiers back to duty on the battlefield. Applying this principle to the hypothetical case, this paper proposes that Patient X (who is a nurse) should get priority of access to the ventilator so that he/she can return to the ‘frontline’ in the fight against COVID‐19.","Kearns, Alan J.",Nurs Inq,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33222346/; https://doi.org/10.1111/nin.12389,244
690225,In situ Pulmonary Artery Thrombosis: A Previously Overlooked Disease,2021-07-08,"Dengue virus (DENV), from the genus flavivirus of the family flaviviridae, causes serious health problems globally. Human monoclonal antibodies (HuMAb) can be used to elucidate the mechanisms of neutralization and antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of DENV infections, leading to the development of a vaccine or therapeutic antibodies. Here, we generated eight HuMAb clones from an Indonesian patient infected with DENV. These HuMAbs exhibited the typical characteristics of weak neutralizing antibodies including high cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses and targeting of the fusion loop epitope (FLE). However, one of the HuMAbs, 3G9, exhibited strong neutralization (NT(50) < 0.1 μg/ml) and possessed a high somatic hyper-mutation rate of the variable region, indicating affinity-maturation. Administration of this antibody significantly prolonged the survival of interferon-α/β/γ receptor knockout C57BL/6 mice after a lethal DENV challenge. Additionally, Fc-modified 3G9 that had lost their in vitro ADE activity showed enhanced therapeutic potency in vivo and competed strongly with an ADE-prone antibody in vitro. Taken together, the affinity-matured FLE-targeting antibody 3G9 exhibits promising features for therapeutic application including a low NT(50) value, potential for treatment of various kinds of mosquito-borne flavivirus infection, and suppression of ADE. This study demonstrates the therapeutic potency of affinity-matured FLE-targeting antibodies.","Kotaki, Tomohiro; Kurosu, Takeshi; Grinyo-Escuer, Ariadna; Davidson, Edgar; Churrotin, Siti; Okabayashi, Tamaki; Puiprom, Orapim; Mulyatno, Kris Cahyo; Sucipto, Teguh Hari; Doranz, Benjamin J.; Ono, Ken-ichiro; Soegijanto, Soegeng; Kameoka, Masanori",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-92403-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34155267/,244

On April 2, when 19 cases had been confirmed among facility A employees, enhanced testing for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, was implemented, so that any employee with a COVID-19-compatible sign or symptom (e.g., fever, cough, or shortness of breath) could receive a test from a local health care facility. By April 11, 369 COVID-19 cases had been confirmed among facility A employees; on April 12, facility A began a phased closure* and did not reopen during the period of investigation (March 16-April 25, 2020). At the request of SDDOH, a CDC team arrived on April 15 to assist with the investigation. During March 16-April 25, a total of 929 (25.6%) laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases were diagnosed among 3,635 facility A employees. At the outbreak's peak, an average of 67 cases per day occurred. An additional 210 (8.7%) cases were identified among 2,403 contacts of employees with diagnosed COVID-19. Overall, 48 COVID-19 patients were hospitalized, including 39 employees and nine contacts. Two employees died; no contacts died. Attack rates were highest among department-groups where employees tended to work in proximity (i.e., <6 feet [2 meters]) to one another on the production line. Cases among employees and their contacts declined to approximately 10 per day within 7 days of facility closure. SARS-CoV-2 can spread rapidly in meat processing facilities because of the close proximity of workstations and prolonged contact between employees (1,2). Facilities can reduce this risk by implementing a robust mitigation program, including engineering and administrative controls, consistent with published guidelines (1).","Steinberg, Jonathan; Kennedy, Erin D.; Basler, Colin; Grant, Michael P.; Jacobs, Jesica R.; Ortbahn, Dustin; Osburn, John; Saydah, Sharon; Tomasi, Suzanne; Clayton, Joshua L.",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32759914/; https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6931a2,244
