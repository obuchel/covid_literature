86558,[Special Program Abstracts].,2020,"Continuous cerebrovascular reactivity assessment in traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been limited by the need for invasive monitoring of either cerebral physiology or arterial blood pressure (ABP). This restricts the application of continuous measures to the acute phase of care, typically in the intensive care unit. It remains unknown if ongoing impairment of cerebrovascular reactivity occurs in the subacute and long-term phase, and if it drives ongoing morbidity in TBI. We describe an entirely non-invasive method for continuous assessment of cerebrovascular reactivity. We describe the technique for entirely non-invasive continuous assessment of cerebrovascular reactivity utilizing near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and robotic transcranial Doppler (rTCD) technology, with details provided for NIRS. Recent advances in continuous high-frequency non-invasive ABP measurement, combined with NIRS or rTCD, can be employed to derive continuous and entirely non-invasive cerebrovascular reactivity metrics. Such non-invasive measures can be obtained during any aspect of patient care post-TBI, and even during outpatient follow-up, avoiding classical intermittent techniques and costly neuroimaging based metrics obtained only at specialized centers. This combination of technology and signal analytic techniques creates avenues for future investigation of the long-term consequences of cerebrovascular reactivity, integrating high-frequency non-invasive cerebral physiology, neuroimaging, proteomics and clinical phenotype at various stages post-injury.","Gomez, A; Dian, J; Zeiler, F A",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10877-020-00472-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31989415/,897

MATERIALS AND METHODS This retrospective study included 123 HCCs in 101 patients treated with the transarterial injection of a miriplatin-iodized oil suspension and RFA (MPT-RFA) (maximum diameter: 1.5 [Formula: see text] 0.5 cm, range: 0.6-3.0 cm) and 68 HCCs in 49 patients treated with the transarterial injection of a miriplatin-iodized oil suspension and MWA (MPT-MWA) (maximum diameter: 1.6 [Formula: see text] 0.7 cm, range: 0.5-3.0 cm). Technical success was defined as the achievement of an ablative margin of at least 5 mm for each tumor. Technical success, complications, and local tumor progression were compared between the two groups. RESULTS The initial technical success rate was significantly higher with MPT-MWA (94.1%) than with MPT-RFA (76.4%; P = 0.003). The number of treatment sessions per nodule was significantly lower with MPT-MWA (1.1) than with MPT-RFA (1.3) (P = 0.004). The major complication rates were similar with MPT-RFA (5.8%) and MPT-MWA (2.7%) (P = 0.391). The one-year local tumor progression rate was similar between MPT-RFA (0%) and MPT-MWA (0%) (P = 0.73). CONCLUSION MPT-MWA may have improved therapeutic efficiency in the treatment of small HCCs.","Miyamoto, Noriyuki; Kanaya, Motoma; Fujii, Takaaki; Kato, Hirotaka; Kudo, Kyohei; Kinota, Naoya",Japanese journal of radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11604-020-01064-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33150469/,897
136696,Intra-patient reproducibility of myocardial SPECT imaging with 201Tl.,2009,"OBJECTIVE Reducing readmissions represents a unique opportunity to improve care and reduce health care costs and is the focus of major payers. A large number of surgical patients are readmitted to hospitals other than where the primary surgery was performed, resulting in clinical decisions that do not incorporate the primary surgeon and potentially alter outcomes. This study characterizes readmission to primary vs different hospitals after abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair and examines the implications with regard to mortality and cost. METHODS Patients who underwent open or endovascular aneurysm repair for AAA were identified from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Chronic Conditions Warehouse, a random 5% national sample of Medicare beneficiaries from 2005 to 2009. Outcomes for patients who underwent AAA repair and were readmitted within 30 days of initial discharge were compared based on readmission location (primary vs different hospital). RESULTS A total of 885 patients underwent AAA repair and were readmitted within 30 days. Of these, 626 (70.7%) returned to the primary facility, and 259 (29.3%) returned to a different facility. Greater distance from patient residence to the primary hospital was the strongest predictor of readmission to a different facility. Patients living 50 to 100 miles from the primary hospital were more likely to be readmitted to a different hospital compared with patients living <10 miles away (odds ratio, 8.50; P < .001). Patients with diagnoses directly related to the surgery (eg, wound infection) were more likely to be readmitted to the primary hospital, whereas medical diagnoses (eg, pneumonia and congestive heart failure) were more likely to be treated at a different hospital. There was no statistically significant difference in mortality between patients readmitted to a different or the primary hospital. Median total 30-day payments were significantly lower at different vs primary hospitals (primary, $11,978 vs different, $11,168; P = .04). CONCLUSIONS Readmission to a different facility after AAA repair is common and occurs more frequently than for the overall Medicare population. Patients travelling a greater distance for AAA repair are more likely to return to different vs the primary hospital when further care is required. For AAA repair, quality healthcare may be achieved at marginally lower cost and with greater patient convenience for selected readmissions at hospitals other than where the initial procedure was performed.","Saunders, Richard S; Fernandes-Taylor, Sara; Kind, Amy J H; Engelbert, Travis L; Greenberg, Caprice C; Smith, Maureen A; Matsumura, Jon S; Kent, K Craig",Journal of vascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvs.2013.12.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24491237/,897
141579,Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Short-Term Course of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.,2021-02-23,"BACKGROUND Endovascular treatment of wake-up strokes (WUS) has been previously described, mostly with the use of pharmacological thrombolysis or first generation thrombectomy devices. OBJECTIVE To describe outcomes of WUS treated with modern endovascular therapy since the Food and Drug Administration approval of stent retrievers, and to identify predictors of good clinical outcome in this population of stroke patients. METHODS We performed a multicenter retrospective analysis of consecutive patients with WUS who underwent thrombectomy with stent retrievers Trevo (Stryker, Kalamazoo, Michigan, USA) and Solitaire FR (Covidien, Irvine, California, USA), or primary aspiration thrombectomy. We correlated favorable clinical outcomes with demographic, clinical, and technical characteristics. RESULTS 52 patients were included in this study; 46 (88%) cases were treated with stent retrievers and 6 (12%) were treated with primary aspiration thrombectomy alone. Successful recanalization (Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) 2b/3) was achieved in 36 (69%) patients. Favorable clinical outcome at 3 months, defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2, was achieved in 25 (48%) patients. Duration of intervention <30 min and its success, defined as TICI 2b/3 recanalization, were strong predictors of favorable clinical outcome at 90 days (p<0.001 and p<0.0001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Our study indicates that endovascular treatment of WUS with stent retrievers and aspiration thrombectomy is safe and effective.","Mokin, Maxim; Kan, Peter; Sivakanthan, Sananthan; Veznedaroglu, Erol; Binning, Mandy J; Liebman, Kenneth M; Jethwa, Pinakin R; Turner, Raymond D; Turk, Aquilla S; Natarajan, Sabareesh K; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Levy, Elad I",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2014-011586; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25634902/,897

153739,"Imaging of atherosclerosis, targeting LFA-1 on inflammatory cells with 111In-DANBIRT.",2018,"BACKGROUND Neonatal sepsis accounts for a large proportion of neonatal deaths in sub-Saharan Africa. The lack of access to diagnostic testing and excessively long turnaround times to result contributes to delays in sepsis identification and initiation of appropriate treatment. This study aims to evaluate the novel InTrays COLOREX Screen and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase for rapid identification of bacterial pathogens causing sepsis and detection of resistance. METHODS Neonates with suspected sepsis admitted to the Harare Central Hospital were prospectively enrolled. One blood culture was collected and incubated using the BacT/ALERT automated system. Positive blood cultures with potential pathogens identified by Gram stain were inoculated on the InTray COLOREX Screen and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase culture plates. RESULTS A total of 216 neonates with suspected sepsis were recruited. Pathogens were isolated from blood cultures in 56 (25.9%) neonates of which 54 were Klebsiella pneumoniae. All K. pneumoniae were resistant to ceftriaxone and 53 (98%) were resistant to gentamicin. Sensitivity and specificity for ceftriaxone-resistant K. pneumoniae detection using InTrays were 100%. InTrays results were interpretable as early as 5-10 hours (median 7 hours, interquartile range 7-7) post blood culture positivity enabling rapid identification and notification of result and leading to a 60% reduction in time to result from blood culture collection. CONCLUSIONS This study shows that the implementation of a novel culture method was feasible and reduced turnaround times for results by 60% compared with standard microbiological techniques. An impact on patient outcomes and cost-effectiveness of this method needs to be demonstrated.","Chimhini, Gwendoline; Olaru, Ioana Diana; Fitzgerald, Felicity; Chisenga, Mutsawashe; Ferreyra, Cecilia; Malou, Nada; Piton, Jeremie; Chimhuya, Simbarashe; Yeung, Shunmay; De, Surjo; Mujuru, Hilda A; Kranzer, Katharina",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0000000000003155; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33941744/,897

Any potential course of action to manage this complex disease requires the systematic and efficient analysis of data that can delineate the underlying pathogenesis. We have developed a mathematical model of disease progression to predict the clinical outcome, utilizing a set of causal factors known to contribute to COVID-19 pathology such as age, comorbidities, and certain viral and immunological parameters. Viral load and selected indicators of a dysfunctional immune response, such as cytokines IL-6 and IFNα which contribute to the cytokine storm and fever, parameters of inflammation D-Dimer and Ferritin, aberrations in lymphocyte number, lymphopenia, and neutralizing antibodies were included for the analysis. The model provides a framework to unravel the multi-factorial complexities of the immune response manifested in SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. Further, this model can be valuable to predict clinical outcome at an individual level, and to develop strategies for allocating appropriate resources to manage severe cases at a population level.","Chirmule, Narendra; Khare, Ravindra; Nair, Pradip; Desai, Bela; Nerurkar, Vivek; Gaur, Amitabh",Clin Exp Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8343949/,897

201965,Freedom and duties: constitutional issues in the light of the CoViD-19 emergency,2020,"In the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus, a single glycoprotein, E2, is required both for attachment to cells and for cell fusion. Cell fusion induced by infection with mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 was inhibited by the addition of monospecific anti-E2 antibody after virus adsorption and penetration. Adsorption of concentrated coronavirions to uninfected cells did not cause cell fusion in the presence of cycloheximide. Thus, cell fusion was induced by E2 on the plasma membrane of infected 17 Cl 1 cells but not by E2 on virions grown in these cells. Trypsin treatment of virions purified from 17 Cl 1 cells quantitatively cleaved 180K E2 to 90K E2 and activated cell-fusing activity of the virions. This proteolytic cleavage yielded two different 90K species which were separable by sodium dodecyl sulfate-hydroxyapatite chromatography. One of the trypsin cleavage products, 90A, was acylated and may be associated with the lipid bilayer. The other, 90B, was not acylated and yielded different peptides than did 90A upon limited digestion with thermolysin or staphylococcal V8 protease. Thus, the cell-fusing activity of a coronavirus required proteolytic cleavage of the E2 glycoprotein, either by the addition of a protease to virions or by cellular proteases acting on E2, which was transported to the plasma membrane during virus maturation. There is a striking functional similarity between the E2 glycoprotein of coronavirus, which is a positive-strand RNA virus, and the hemagglutinin glycoprotein of negative-strand orthomyxoviruses, in that a single glycoprotein has both attachment and protease-activated cell-fusing activities.","Sturman, L S; Ricard, C S; Holmes, K V",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2999443/,897
202034,The value of mitigating epidemic peaks of COVID-19 for more effective public health responses,2020,"OBJECTIVE To study the medication in children with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in Wuhan, China, and to provide a reference for rational drug use in clinical practice. METHODS A retrospective analysis was performed on the medical data of the children who were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection from January 26 to March 5, 2020. The children were divided into an asymptomatic group with 41 children and a symptomatic group with 73 children. A subgroup analysis was performed to investigate the effect of different antiviral regimens (monotherapy, double therapy, or triple therapy) and whether interferon α-1b was used in combination with azithromycin on the length of hospital stay and the clearance time of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. RESULTS A total of 114 children with SARS-CoV-2 infection (72 boys and 42 girls) were enrolled. The median age of the children was 7.1 years. The median length of hospital stay was 10 days and the clearance time of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid was 6 days. In either group, the subgroup analysis showed no significance differences in the length of hospital stay and the clearance time of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid between the subgroups treated with different combinations of antiviral drugs and the subgroups treated with interferon α-1b alone or in combination with azithromycin (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS It is not recommended to use the routine combinations of antiviral drugs for children with SARS-COV-2 infection or combine with azithromycin for the purpose of antiviral therapy.","DU, Zhao-Song; Xu, Hua; Liu, Mao-Chang",Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33476539/,897
220003,Coronavirus and the European Union: the IPCR devices and the Task Force of 2 March 2020,2020,"COVID-19 outbreak is the biggest threat to human health in recent history. Currently, there are over 1.5 million related deaths and 75 million people infected around the world (as of 22/12/2020). The identification of virulence factors which determine disease susceptibility and severity in different cell types remains an essential challenge. The serine protease TMPRSS2 has been shown to be important for S protein priming and viral entry, however, little is known about its regulation. SPINT2 is a member of the family of Kunitz type serine protease inhibitors and has been shown to inhibit TMPRSS2. Here, we explored the existence of a co-regulation between SPINT2/TMPRSS2 and found a tightly regulated protease/inhibitor expression balance across tissues. We found that SPINT2 negatively correlates with SARS-CoV-2 expression in Calu-3 and Caco-2 cell lines and was down-regulated in secretory cells from COVID-19 patients. We validated our findings using Calu-3 cell lines and observed a strong increase in viral load after SPINT2 knockdown, while overexpression lead to a drastic reduction of the viral load. Additionally, we evaluated the expression of SPINT2 in datasets from comorbid diseases using bulk and scRNA-seq data. We observed its down-regulation in colon, kidney and liver tumors as well as in alpha pancreatic islets cells from diabetes Type 2 patients, which could have implications for the observed comorbidities in COVID-19 patients suffering from chronic diseases.","Ramirez Alvarez, Carlos; Kee, Carmon; Sharma, Ashwini Kumar; Thomas, Leonie; Schmidt, Florian I; Stanifer, Megan L; Boulant, Steeve; Herrmann, Carl",PLoS Pathog,,897

244045,COVID-19 in Brazilian indigenous people: a new threat to old problems,2020,"While immunopathology has been widely studied in severe COVID-19 patients, immunoprotective factors in non-hospitalized patients have remained largely elusive. We systematically analyzed 484 peripheral immune cell signatures, various serological parameters and TCR repertoire in a longitudinal cohort of 63 mild and 15 hospitalized patients versus 14 asymptomatic and 26 control individuals. Within three days following PCR diagnosis, we observed coordinated responses of CD4 and CD8 T cells, various antigen presenting cells and antibody-secreting cells in mild, but not hospitalized COVID-19 patients. This early-stage SARS-CoV-2-specific response was predominantly characterized by substantially expanded clonotypes of CD4 and less of CD8 T cells. The early-stage responses of T cells and dendritic cells were highly predictive for later seroconversion and protective antibody levels after three weeks in mild non-hospitalized, but not in hospitalized patients. Our systemic analysis provides the first full picture and early-stage trajectory of highly coordinated immune responses in mild COVID-19 patients.","Capelle, Christophe M.; Cire, Severine; Domingues, Olivia; Ernens, Isabelle; Hedin, Fanny; Fischer, Aurelie; Snoeck, Chantal; Ammerlaan, Wim; Konstantinou, Maria; Grzyb, Kamil; Skupin, Alexander; Carty, Cara L.; Hilger, Christiane; Gilson, Georges; Celebic, Aljosa; Sol, Antonio Del; Kaplan, Ian M.; Betsou, Fay; Abdelrahman, Tamir; Cosma, Antonio; Vaillant, Michel Thierry; Fagherazzi, Guy; Ollert, Markus; Hefeng, Feng Q.",,,897
254299,CoViD-19 emergency and balancing constitutional rights: what space for substantive legality?,2020,"Laboratory-acquired infections (LAIs) are defined as infections of laboratory staff by exposure to pathogenic microorganisms during an experimental procedure. For a biosafety level-3 (BSL-3) laboratory with a high potential of exposure, reducing risks and threats relevant to LAIs has become a critical concern, especially after the recent outbreak of Novel Coronavirus causing COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. This study aimed to investigate the spatial-temporal characteristics of bioaerosol dispersion and deposition of two kinds of bioaerosols (Serratia marcescens and phage &#934;X174). A combination of laboratory experiment and numerical simulation was adopted to explore bioaerosol removal. Three-dimensional concentration iso-surface mapping in conjunction with flow field analysis was employed to elucidate bioaerosol migration and deposition behavior. The total deposition number and unit area deposition ratio were calculated for different surfaces. The results indicate that bioaerosol concentration remains stable for up to 400 s after release, and that almost 70% of all bioaerosol particles become deposited on the surfaces of walls and equipment. Vortex flow regions and high-concentration regions were determined, and the most severely contaminated surfaces and locations were identified. Our results could provide the scientific basis for controlling the time interval between different experiments and also provide guidelines for a laboratory disinfection routine. Furthermore, future work regarding laboratory layout optimization and high efficiency air distribution for bioaerosol removal in a BSL-3 laboratory should be emphasized.","Liu, Zhijian; Zhuang, Wenbin; Hu, Lingfei; Rong, Rui; Li, Jinsong; Ding, Wenjun; Li, Na",Build Environ,,897
257200,War economy and the COVID-19 pandemic: Inequalities in stimulus packages as an additional challenge for health systems,2020,"BACKGROUND: The 2015 outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in the Republic of Korea is a recent and representative occurrence of nationwide outbreaks of Emerging Infectious Diseases (EIDs). In addition to physical symptoms, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression are common following outbreaks of EID. METHODS: The present study investigated the long-term mental health outcomes and related risk factors in survivors of MERS. A prospective nationwide cohort study was conducted 12 months after the MERS outbreak at multi-centers throughout Korea. PTSD and depression as the main mental health outcomes were assessed with the Impact of Event Scale-Revised Korean version (IES-R-K) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) respectively. RESULTS: 42.9% of survivors reported PTSD (IES-R-K &#8805; 25) and 27.0% reported depression (PHQ-9 &#8805; 10) at 12 months post-MERS. A multivariate analysis revealed that anxiety (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 5.76; 95%CI, 1.29-25.58; P = 0.021), and a greater recognition of stigma (aOR, 11.09, 95%CI, 2.28-53.90; P = 0.003) during the MERS-affected period were independent predictors of PTSD at 12 months after the MERS outbreak. Having a family member who died from MERS predicted the development of depression (aOR, 12.08, 95%CI, 1.47-99.19; P = 0.020). CONCLUSION: This finding implies that psychosocial factors, particularly during the outbreak phase, influenced the mental health of patients over a long-term period. Mental health support among the infected subjects and efforts to reduce stigma may improve recovery from psychological distress in an EID outbreak.","Park, Hye Yoon; Park, Wan Beom; Lee, So Hee; Kim, Jeong Lan; Lee, Jung Jae; Lee, Haewoo; Shin, Hyoung-Shik",BMC Public Health,,897

Its empirical use has been associated with multiple cardiac adverse reactions pertaining to its ancillary multi-channel blocking properties, vaguely characterized until now. We aimed to characterize qualitatively the cardiotoxicity associated with lopinavir/ritonavir in the setting of COVID-19. Spontaneous notifications of cardiac adverse drug reactions reported to the national Pharmacovigilance Network were collected for 8 weeks since March 1st 2020. The Nice Regional Center of Pharmacovigilance, whose scope of expertise is drug-induced long QT syndrome, analyzed the cases, including the reassessment of all available ECGs. QTc &#8805; 500 ms and delta QTc > 60 ms from baseline were deemed serious. Twenty-two cases presented with 28 cardiac adverse reactions associated with the empirical use of lopinavir/ritonavir in a hospital setting. Most adverse reactions reflected lopinavir/ritonavir potency to block voltage-gated potassium channels with 5 ventricular arrhythmias and 17 QTc prolongations. An average QTc augmentation of 97 ± 69 ms was reported. Twelve QTc prolongations were deemed serious. Other cases were likely related to lopinavir/ritonavir potency to block sodium channels: 1 case of bundle branch block and 5 recurrent bradycardias. The incidence of cardiac adverse reactions of lopinavir/ritonavir was estimated between 0.3% and 0.4%. These cardiac adverse drug reactions offer a new insight in its ancillary multi-channel blocking functions. Lopinavir/ritonavir cardiotoxicity may be of concern for its empirical use during the COVID-19 pandemic. Caution should be exerted relative to this risk where lopinavir/ritonavir summary of product characteristics should be implemented accordingly.","Fresse, Audrey; Viard, Delphine; Romani, Serena; Gérard, Alexandre; Lepelley, Marion; Rocher, Fanny; Salem, Joe-Elie; Drici, Milou-Daniel",Int. j. cardiol,,897
290728,[Special Program Abstracts],2020,"Introduction: On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared an international emergency due to the pandemic caused by a new coronavirus. There are some oncological indications that have special priority and studies are still being carried out despite the current situation. In these studies we have found suspicious findings of COVID-19 pneumonia in asymptomatic patients. The objective of this work is to assess the incidence of these findings, describe their characteristics and the evolution of suspected patients. Material and methods: Oncological PET studies carried out in asymptomatic patients between March 18 and April 8, 2020 have been reviewed. Patients who presented findings suggestive of corresponding to an pulmonary infectious process were selected. Clinical findings have been reviewed to confirm or rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: During the specified period, a total of 129 PET/CT studies were performed. Of these, 11 (8.5%) found suspicious findings of a pulmonary infectious process. These were 8 men and 3 women aged between 30 and 79 years (mean 62.2). Conclusions: Patients with COVID-19 can present few symptoms of the disease, and in PET/CT studies both presymptomatic and almost asymptomatic patients can be detected, so nuclear medicine physicians should take special attention to the pulmonary evaluation of PET/CT studies.","Mucientes Rasilla, J; Jimeno Pernett, R; Cardona Arboniés, J",Rev Esp Med Nucl Imagen Mol,,897
310178,Preventive Behaviors and Mental Health-Related Symptoms Among Immunocompromised Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Analysis of the COVID Impact Survey,2021,"The SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein is a focal point for vaccine immunogen and therapeutic antibody design, and also serves as a critical antigen in the evaluation of immune responses to COVID-19. A common feature amongst enveloped viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1 is the propensity for displaying host-derived glycans on entry spike proteins. Similarly displayed glycosylation motifs can serve as the basis for glyco-epitope mediated cross-reactivity by antibodies, which can have important implications on virus neutralization, antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection, and the interpretation of antibody titers in serological assays. From a panel of nine anti-HIV-1 gp120 reactive antibodies, we selected two (PGT126 and PGT128) that displayed high levels of cross-reactivity with the SARS-CoV-2 spike. We report that these antibodies are incapable of neutralizing pseudoviruses expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and are unlikely to mediate ADE via FcÎ³RII receptor engagement. Nevertheless, ELISA and other immunoreactivity experiments demonstrate these antibodies are capable of binding the SARS-CoV-2 spike in a glycan-dependent manner. These results contribute to the growing literature surrounding SARS-CoV-2 S cross-reactivity, as we demonstrate the ability for cross-reactive antibodies to interfere in immunoassays.","Mannar, Dhiraj; Leopold, Karoline; Subramaniam, Sriram",Sci Rep,,897
317912,Constitution and emergency: the Coronavirus experience,2020,"In face of the everlasting battle toward COVID-19 and the rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2, no specific and effective drugs for treating this disease have been reported until today. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor of SARS-CoV-2, mediates the virus infection by binding to spike protein. Although ACE2 is expressed in the lung, kidney, and intestine, its expressing levels are rather low, especially in the lung. Considering the great infectivity of COVID-19, we speculate that SARS-CoV-2 may depend on other routes to facilitate its infection. Here, we first discover an interaction between host cell receptor CD147 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The loss of CD147 or blocking CD147 in Vero E6 and BEAS-2B cell lines by anti-CD147 antibody, Meplazumab, inhibits SARS-CoV-2 amplification. Expression of human CD147 allows virus entry into non-susceptible BHK-21 cells, which can be neutralized by CD147 extracellular fragment. Viral loads are detectable in the lungs of human CD147 (hCD147) mice infected with SARS-CoV-2, but not in those of virus-infected wild type mice. Interestingly, virions are observed in lymphocytes of lung tissue from a COVID-19 patient. Human T cells with a property of ACE2 natural deficiency can be infected with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus in a dose-dependent manner, which is specifically inhibited by Meplazumab. Furthermore, CD147 mediates virus entering host cells by endocytosis. Together, our study reveals a novel virus entry route, CD147-spike protein, which provides an important target for developing specific and effective drug against COVID-19.","Wang, Ke; Chen, Wei; Zhang, Zheng; Deng, Yongqiang; Lian, Jian-Qi; Du, Peng; Wei, Ding; Zhang, Yang; Sun, Xiu-Xuan; Gong, Li; Yang, Xu; He, Lei; Zhang, Lei; Yang, Zhiwei; Geng, Jie-Jie; Chen, Ruo; Zhang, Hai; Wang, Bin; Zhu, Yu-Meng; Nan, Gang; Jiang, Jian-Li; Li, Ling; Wu, Jiao; Lin, Peng; Huang, Wan; Xie, Liangzhi; Zheng, Zhao-Hui; Zhang, Kui; Miao, Jin-Lin; Cui, Hong-Yong; Huang, Min; Zhang, Jun; Fu, Ling; Yang, Xiang-Min; Zhao, Zhongpeng; Sun, Shihui; Gu, Hongjing; Wang, Zhe; Wang, Chun-Fu; Lu, Yacheng; Liu, Ying-Ying; Wang, Qing-Yi; Bian, Huijie; Zhu, Ping; Chen, Zhi-Nan",Signal Transduct Target Ther,,897

404040,Correlation between BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 vaccine-associated hypermetabolic lymphadenopathy and humoral immunity in patients with hematologic malignancy,2021,"Background. The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is lethal and extremely contagious, with a rapidly rising global prevalence. The World Health Organization has declared the outbreak a global pandemic;it is reported to have spread to nearly every country in the world. However, the prevalence varies across developed and developing countries, as well as within different regions of the same country. It is not hidden that estimating the magnitude of COVID-19 infection from the community surveys is critical for public health policymakers to make decisions to deal with the outbreak, optimize measures, and design mitigation plans. Methods. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from 01 July to 31 August 2020 in the northeastern Ethiopia region. A simple random sampling technique was used to select study participants from the community survey, contact traces from confirmed cases, and infection suspects. After extraction of viral nucleic acid from oropharyngeal specimen, the real-time fluorescent polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) kit was used for detecting novel coronavirus. Results. A total of 8752 study participants were included in this study. About 63.6% were males and 36.4% were females. Out of the total 8752 study participants, 291 (3.3%) were found to be infected with the virus. The first laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 were detected in the fourth week of the study period, that is, from July 24 to July 31, 2020, and the peak prevalence was observed in the last two weeks. The COVID-19 infection was more prevalent among males and in the age group of 36–52 years. Participants tested via contact trace had 1.65 times (AOR = 1.65, 95% CI = 1.09–2.51, P = 0.018) the likelihood of COVID-19 infection in comparison to the other forms of community surveys. Conclusion. The trend in the prevalence of COVID-19 infection in the northeastern region has shown increment, and increasing testing capacity has a greater benefit in identifying early infection for the prevention, treatment, and control of the international pandemic.

639117,Management of differentiated thyroid cancer through nuclear medicine facilities during Covid-19 emergency: the telemedicine challenge,2020-09-23,"Universities open for in-person instruction during the 2020-21 academic year implemented a range of prevention strategies to limit the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, including physical distancing, mask use, vaccination, contact tracing, case investigation, and quarantine protocols (1). However, in some academic programs, such as health-related programs, aviation, and kindergarten through grade 12 (K-12) education, maintaining physical distance while still providing instruction is difficult; for universities with such programs, a single confirmed case of COVID-19 could result in a large number of students, staff members, and instructors being designated close contacts and requiring quarantine if they are not fully vaccinated, even if masks were worn when contact occurred. In January 2021, the St. Louis City Health Department allowed Saint Louis University (SLU) to implement a modified quarantine protocol that considered mask use when determining which close contacts required quarantine.* To assess the impact of the protocol, SLU assessed positive SARS-CoV-2 test result rates by masking status of the persons with COVID-19 and their close contacts. During January-May 2021, 265 students received a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result; these students named 378 close contacts. Compared with close contacts whose exposure only occurred when both persons were masked (7.7%), close contacts with any unmasked exposure (32.4%) had higher adjusted odds ratios (aORs) of receiving a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result (aOR = 4.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.4-31.1). Any additional exposures were associated with a 40.0% increase in odds of a positive test result (aOR = 1.4; 95% CI = 1.2-1.6). These findings reinforce that universal masking and having fewer encounters in close contact with persons with COVID-19 prevents the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in a university setting. Universities opening for in-person instruction could consider taking mask use into account when determining which unvaccinated close contacts require quarantine if enforced testing protocols are in place. However, this study was conducted before the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant became the dominant strain of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States, which could have affected these findings given that the Delta variant has been found to be associated with increased transmissibility compared to previous variants.","Rebmann, Terri; Loux, Travis M.; Arnold, Lauren D.; Charney, Rachel; Horton, Deborah; Gomel, Ashley",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7036a3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34499631/,897
