2377,2377,2377,The Occupational Risk of Influenza A (H1N1) Infection among Healthcare Personnel during the 2009 Pandemic: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies,18.568012,9.911333,2016-08-31,"INTRODUCTION: The aim of this review was to record systematically and assess the published literature relating to the occupational risk of influenza A (H1N1) infection among healthcare personnel during the 2009 pandemic. METHODS: The literature search was performed in June 2015. An update was carried out in May 2016. It was applied to the electronic databases EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, CINAHL and Google Scholar. The quality assessment was conducted with a tool using eight criteria. A meta-analysis was carried out to compute pooled effect estimates for influenza A (H1N1) infection. RESULTS: A total of 26 studies were included in the review, 15 studies met the criteria for the meta-analysis. After a sensitivity analysis the pooled analysis showed a significantly increased odds for influenza A (H1N1) infection for healthcare personnel compared to controls/comparisons (OR = 2.08, 95% CI = 1.73 to 2.51). The pooled prevalence rate for healthcare personnel alone was 6.3%. CONCLUSIONS: This review corroborates the assumption that healthcare personnel were particularly at risk of influenza A (H1N1) infection during the 2009 pandemic. Healthcare facilities should intensify their focus on strategies to prevent infections among healthcare personnel, especially during the first period of pandemics.","Lietz, Janna; Westermann, Claudia; Nienhaus, Albert; Schablon, Anja",PLoS One,353,27

4303,4303,4303,A double-blind placebo-controlled trial of azithromycin to reduce mortality and improve growth in high-risk young children with non-bloody diarrhoea in low resource settings: the Antibiotics for Children with Diarrhoea (ABCD) trial protocol,18.791115,10.319917,2020-01-13,"BACKGROUND: Acute diarrhoea is a common cause of illness and death among children in low- to middle-income settings. World Health Organization guidelines for the clinical management of acute watery diarrhoea in children focus on oral rehydration, supplemental zinc and feeding advice. Routine use of antibiotics is not recommended except when diarrhoea is bloody or cholera is suspected. Young children who are undernourished or have a dehydrating diarrhoea are more susceptible to death at 90 days after onset of diarrhoea. Given the mortality risk associated with diarrhoea in children with malnutrition or dehydrating diarrhoea, expanding the use of antibiotics for this subset of children could be an important intervention to reduce diarrhoea-associated mortality and morbidity. We designed the Antibiotics for Childhood Diarrhoea (ABCD) trial to test this intervention. METHODS: ABCD is a double-blind, randomised trial recruiting 11,500 children aged 2–23 months presenting with acute non-bloody diarrhoea who are dehydrated and/or undernourished (i.e. have a high risk for mortality). Enrolled children in Bangladesh, India, Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Pakistan and Tanzania are randomised (1:1) to oral azithromycin 10 mg/kg or placebo once daily for 3 days and followed-up for 180 days. Primary efficacy endpoints are all-cause mortality during the 180 days post-enrolment and change in linear growth 90 days post-enrolment. DISCUSSION: Expanding the treatment of acute watery diarrhoea in high-risk children to include an antibiotic may offer an opportunity to reduce deaths. These benefits may result from direct antimicrobial effects on pathogens or other incompletely understood mechanisms including improved nutrition, alterations in immune responsiveness or improved enteric function. The expansion of indications for antibiotic use raises concerns about the emergence of antimicrobial resistance both within treated children and the communities in which they live. ABCD will monitor antimicrobial resistance. The ABCD trial has important policy implications. If the trial shows significant benefits of azithromycin use, this may provide evidence to support reconsideration of antibiotic indications in the present World Health Organization diarrhoea management guidelines. Conversely, if there is no evidence of benefit, these results will support the current avoidance of antibiotics except in dysentery or cholera, thereby avoiding inappropriate use of antibiotics and reaffirming the current guidelines.

For RV prevention and control, it is a key to uncover the interaction mechanism between virus and its receptors. However, it is hard to specially purify the viral receptors, including histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs). Previously, the protruding domain protein (P protein) of human norovirus (genotype II.4) was displayed on the surface of Escherichia coli, and it specifically recognized and captured the viral ligands. In order to further verify the feasibility of the system, P protein was replaced by VP8* of RV (G9P[8]) in this study. In the system, VP8* could be correctly released by thrombin treatment with antigenicity retaining, which was confirmed by Western blot and Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays. Type A HBGAs from porcine gastric mucin (PGM) were recognized and captured by this system. From saliva mixture, the captured viral receptor bound with displayed VP8* was confirmed positive with monoclonal antibody against type A HBGAs. It indicated that the target ligands could be easily separated from the complex matrix. These results demonstrate that the bacterial surface display system will be an effective platform to explore viral receptors/ligands from cell lines or food matrix.","Liu, Danlei; Geng, Haoran; Zhang, Zilei; Xing, Yifan; Yang, Danlu; Liu, Zhicheng; Wang, Dapeng",Virol Sin,353,12

We identified a complex sequence of molecular events including shock-dependent and reperfusion-dependent responses that offer a new comprehensive approach for consequences of HS. Shock-dependent initializing mechanisms include the induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, and CD14 and play a catalyzing role for subsequent phenotypic changes following resuscitation. The early immediate response genes iNOS and COX-2 promote the inflammatory response by the rapid and excessive production of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandins. The transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) may regulate the induction of iNOS during the ischemic phase of shock. NO is an important signaling molecule which is involved in redox-sensitive mechanisms including the downstream activation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB. NO-dependent NF-κB activation promotes the induction of inflammatory cytokine expression during the reperfusion phase. Peroxynitrite-mediated direct toxicity and NO-mediated inflammatory toxicity contribute to organ injury. Patients suffering consequences of severe HS are susceptible to systemic inflammation, organ injury, and mortality if physiologic and therapeutic mechanisms are ineffective in limiting the activation of the inflammatory cascade.","Hierholzer, Christian; Billiar, Timothy R.",Langenbecks Arch Surg,353,12

The role of Dot1L against infections was highlighted by an increase of influenza A and vesicular stomatitis virus replication in Dot1L-inhibited cells mediated by a decreased antiviral response. Interferon-beta (IFN-β) reporter assays indicate that Dot1L is involved in the control of retinoic acid-inducible gene-I protein (RIG-I) signaling. Accordingly, Dot1L inhibition decreases the IFN-β promoter stimulation and RIG-I- mitochondria-associated viral sensor (RIG-I-MAVS) association upon viral infection. Replication of an influenza A virus lacking NS1 (delNS1), incapable of counteracting the antiviral response, is not affected by Dot1L inhibition. Consequently, RIG-I-MAVS association and nuclear factor–κB (NF-κB) nuclear translocation, are not affected by the Dot1L inhibition in delNS1 infected cells. Restoration of NS1 expression in trans also reinstated Dot1L as a regulator of the RIG-I-dependent signaling in delNS1 infections. Interferon-inducible E3 ligase tripartite motif-containing protein 25 (TRIM25) expression increases in influenza virus infected cells, but Dot1L inhibition reduces both the TRIM25 expression and TRIM25 protein levels. TRIM25 overexpression reverses the defective innate response mediated by Dot1L inhibition elicited upon virus infection or by overexpression of RIG-I signaling intermediates. Thus, TRIM25 is a control point of the RIG-I recognition pathway controlled by Dot1L and may have a general role in RNA viruses recognized by the RIG-I sensor.","Marcos-Villar, Laura; Nistal-Villan, Estanislao; Zamarreño, Noelia; Garaigorta, Urtzi; Gastaminza, Pablo; Nieto, Amelia",Cells,353,12

The purified antibodies were used in Western analysis of cell lysates and in indirect immunofluorescence experiments on cultured cells. On Western blots, the antibodies recognized the ∼165 kDa MNK protein in CHO cells and human fibroblasts. No MNK signal could be detected in fibroblasts from a patient with Menkes disease or in Hep3B hepatocellular carcinoma cells, confirming the specificity of the antibodies. Immunocytochemical analysis of CHO cells and human fibroblasts showed a distinct perinuclear signal corresponding to the pattern of the Golgi complex. This staining pattern was similar to that of α-mannosidase II which is a known resident enzyme of the Golgi complex. Using brefeldin A, a fungal inhibitor of protein secretion, we further demonstrated that the MNK protein is localized to the trans-Golgi network. This data provides direct evidence for a subcellular localization of the MNK protein which is similar to the proposed vacuolar localization of Ccc2p, the yeast homolog of MNK and WND (ATP7B), the Wilson disease gene product. In light of the proposed role of MNK both in subcellular copper trafficking and in copper efflux, these data suggest a model for how these two processes are linked and represent an important step in the functional analysis of the MNK protein.","Dierick, Herman A.; Adam, Ayla N.; Escara-Wilke, June F.; Glover, Thomas W.",Hum Mol Genet,353,27

The development of prevention strategies in the field of occupational health requires a detailed knowledge about the impact of the disease on employees. This review article aims not only at evaluating the burden of NoV outbreaks on staff but also at discussing implications for future prevention strategies. METHODS: Published NoV outbreaks in Central and Northern Europe were identified via a systematic literature search. Additionally, published NoV outbreaks in Germany were detected via a manual literature search. Key epidemiological data, as the number of symptomatic staff, was then extracted. The proportion of affected employees was calculated for each dataset (single NoV outbreaks or aggregated data of multiple outbreaks). RESULTS: Overall, 116 datasets were extracted from 72 relevant articles. 144,852 persons were affected by NoV gastroenteritis, 25,408 out of them (17.5%) were employees. 23,874 (94.0%) of them fell sick during outbreaks in hospitals and related settings. NoV cases among personnel in food establishments were reported only sporadically (mean ratio: 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Employees in hospitals and community facilities seem quantitatively to be most vulnerable towards NoV epidemics. Therefore, high quality of prevention measures in these settings, respective compliance with prevention strategies should have the highest priority. The disease can be considered as an occupational disease, even regularly without long-term consequences. Following work safety rules, a vaccination for vulnerable groups should be recommended if the vaccine development turns out to be successful.

While metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) is safe and effective in treating severe obesity, the role of MBS in transplant patients continues to evolve. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed of sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) patients in the 2017 Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation Quality and Improvement Project (MBSAQIP) database. Propensity and case-control matching, and multivariable logistic regression were performed for 30-day post-operative outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 336 transplant patients were compared with 157,413 patients without transplant. Propensity and case-control matching reveal no significant differences in mortality (p > 0.2). However, case-control matching revealed longer operative time (104 min versus 76 min, p < 0.001), increased length of stay (2 days versus 1 day, p < 0.05), perioperative transfusions (2% versus 0.22%, p = 0.009), and leak rates (2.2% versus 0.55%, p = 0.02) in the transplant cohort. On multivariable regression analysis, prior transplantation was associated with higher rates of overall (OR 1.6, p = 0.007) and bariatric-related morbidity (OR 1.78, p = 0.004), leak (OR 3.47, p = 0.0027), and surgical site infection (OR 3.32, p = 0.004). Prior transplantation did not predict overall (p = 0.55) nor bariatric-related mortality (p = 0.99). CONCLUSION: MBS in prior solid organ transplantation patients is overall safe, but is associated with increased operative time and length of stay, as well as higher rates of some post-operative morbidity.","Fagenson, Alexander M.; Mazzei, Michael M.; Zhao, Huaqing; Lu, Xiaoning; Edwards, Michael A.",Obes Surg,353,1

However, we still know very little about the specific mechanism of this process. Tp0768 is an infection-stage–dependent antigen that plays an important role in the infection of Treponema pallidum. In this study, we demonstrated that Tp0768 stimulation of macrophages can cause IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 mRNA expression levels to increase in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Further research showed that Tp0768 activated ER stress and the ROS/NF-κB pathway in macrophages. Inhibition of ER stress and the ROS/NF-κB pathway inhibited the expression of IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 induced by Tp0768. In addition, pretreatment with a PERK pathway inhibitor significantly reduced the expression of the NF-κB and JNK pathways, while also downregulating the expression of IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8. Tp0768 stimulation can activate IRE1α/XBP-1 signaling and participate in the induction of inflammatory cytokines through the JNK pathway. These findings indicate that Tp0768 promotes the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 by macrophages through ER stress and the ROS/NF-κB pathway, which are also involved in the activation of the NF-κB and JNK pathways that are induced by the PERK pathway and activation of IRE1α/XBP-1 signaling. KEY POINTS: • This study found for the first time that the recombinant Treponema pallidum protein Tp0768 promotes the production of IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 by macrophages through ER stress. • Recombinant Treponema pallidum protein Tp0768 regulates the ROS/NF-κB pathway through ER stress. • ER stress-related pathway PERK induces the expression of IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 by activating the NF-κB pathway and the JNK pathway. • IRE1α can induce the splicing of XBP-1mRNA and activate the JNK pathway.

Jelly fig polysaccharide (JFP) and pullulan were blended to prepare fast-dissolving nanofiber by electrospinning. The continuous and uniform nanofibers were produced from the solution of 1% (w/w) JFP, 12% (w/w) pullulan, and 1 wt% Triton X-305. The SEM images confirmed that the prepared nanofibers exhibited uniform morphology with an average diameter of 144 ± 19 nm. The inclusion of JFP in pullulan was confirmed by TGA and FTIR studies. XRD analysis revealed that the increased crystallinity of JFP/pullulan nanofiber was observed due to the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The tensile strength and water vapor permeability of the JFP/pullulan nanofiber membrane were also enhanced considerably compared to pullulan nanofiber. The JFP/pullulan nanofibers loaded with hydrophobic model drugs like ampicillin and dexamethasone were rapidly dissolved in water within 60 s and release the encapsulants dispersive into the surrounding. The antibacterial activity, fast disintegration properties of the JFP/pullulan nanofiber were also confirmed by the zone of inhibition and UV spectrum studies.

Several recent studies suggested presence of clinical phenotypes in patients with sepsis and heterogenous treatment effects across different sepsis phenotypes. We examined the latent phenotypes of sepsis with coagulopathy and the associations between thrombomodulin treatment and the 28-day and in-hospital mortality for each phenotype. METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of multicentre registries containing data on patients (aged ≥ 16 years) who were admitted to intensive care units for severe sepsis or septic shock in Japan. Three multicentre registries were divided into derivation (two registries) and validation (one registry) cohorts. Phenotypes were derived using k-means with coagulation markers, platelet counts, prothrombin time/international normalised ratios, fibrinogen, fibrinogen/fibrin-degradation-products (FDP), D-dimer, and antithrombin activities. Associations between thrombomodulin treatment and survival outcomes (28-day and in-hospital mortality) were assessed in the derived clusters using a generalised estimating equation. RESULTS: Four sepsis phenotypes were derived from 3694 patients in the derivation cohort. Cluster dA (n = 323) had severe coagulopathy with high FDP and D-dimer levels, severe organ dysfunction, and high mortality. Cluster dB had severe disease with moderate coagulopathy. Clusters dC and dD had moderate and mild disease with and without coagulopathy, respectively. Thrombomodulin was associated with a lower 28-day (adjusted risk difference [RD]: − 17.8% [95% CI − 28.7 to − 6.9%]) and in-hospital (adjusted RD: − 17.7% [95% CI − 27.6 to − 7.8%]) mortality only in cluster dA. Sepsis phenotypes were similar in the validation cohort, and thrombomodulin treatment was also associated with lower 28-day (RD: − 24.9% [95% CI − 49.1 to − 0.7%]) and in-hospital mortality (RD: − 30.9% [95% CI − 55.3 to − 6.6%]). CONCLUSIONS: We identified four coagulation marker-based sepsis phenotypes. The treatment effects of thrombomodulin varied across sepsis phenotypes. This finding will facilitate future trials of thrombomodulin, in which a sepsis phenotype with high FDP and D-dimer can be targeted.

With about 3.5 billion cases (2017), more people are affected than by any other disease group. The main oral diseases comprise tooth decay of permanent and deciduous teeth, severe periodontal disease, and oral and lip cancer. With a largely unchanged high global prevalence, but significantly growing population sizes, the pressure on health systems is increasing, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Nonetheless, in many countries oral health has insufficient priority as a key health topic, including the global health policy discourse of German and international stakeholders.

Here, we use phylogenetic, functional, and geographic filters to predict the similarity between symbiont communities, using as a test case the assembly process in viral communities of Mexican bats. We construct generalized linear models to predict viral community similarity, as measured by the Jaccard index, as a function of differences in host phylogeny, host functionality, and spatial co‐occurrence, evaluating the models using the Akaike information criterion. Two model classes are constructed: a “known” model, where virus–host relationships are based only on data reported in Mexico, and a “potential” model, where viral reports of all the Americas are used, but then applied only to bat species that are distributed in Mexico. Although the “known” model shows only weak dependence on any of the filters, the “potential” model highlights the importance of all three filter types—phylogeny, functional traits, and co‐occurrence—in the assemblage of viral communities. The differences between the “known” and “potential” models highlight the utility of modeling at different “scales” so as to compare and contrast known information at one scale to another one, where, for example, virus information associated with bats is much scarcer.","Nieto‐Rabiela, Fabiola; Rico‐Chávez, Oscar; Suzán, Gerardo; Stephens, Christopher R.",Ecol Evol,353,1

It is estimated that pre- and asymptomatic individuals are responsible for more than half of all transmissions. By detecting infected individuals before they have overt symptoms, wearable devices could potentially and significantly reduce the proportion of transmissions by pre-symptomatic individuals. the algorithm using Ava bracelet data when coupled with self-reported Daily Symptom Diary data (Wearable + Symptom Data Algo; experimental condition); the algorithm using self-reported Daily Symptom Diary data alone (Symptom Only Algo; control condition). In addition, we will determine which of the two algorithms has superior performance characteristics for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection including early or asymptomatic infection as confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 virus testing. TRIAL DESIGN: The trial is a randomized, single-blinded, two-period, two-sequence crossover trial. All subjects will participate in an initial Learning Phase (varying from 2 weeks to 3 months depending on enrolment date), followed by two contiguous 3-month test phases, Period 1 and Period 2. Each subject will undergo the experimental condition (the Wearable + Symptom Data Algo) in one of these periods and the control condition (Symptom Only Algo) in the other period. The order will be randomly assigned, resulting in subjects being allocated 1:1 to either Sequence 1 (experimental condition first) or Sequence 2 (control condition first). Based on demographics, medical history and/or profession, each subject will be stratified at baseline into a high-risk and normal-risk group within each sequence. PARTICIPANTS: The trial will be conducted in the Netherlands. A target of 20,000 subjects will be enrolled. Based on demographics, medical history and/or profession, each subject will be stratified at baseline into a high-risk and normal-risk group within each sequence. This results in approximately 6,500 normal-risk individuals and 3,500 high-risk individuals per sequence. Subjects will be recruited from previously studied cohorts as well as via public campaigns and social media. All data for this study will be collected remotely through the Ava COVID-RED app, the Ava bracelet, surveys in the COVID-RED web portal, and self-sampling serology and PCR kits. During recruitment, subjects will be invited to visit the COVID-RED web portal (www.covid-red.eu). After successfully completing the enrolment questionnaire, meeting eligibility criteria and indicating interest in joining the study, subjects will receive the subject information sheet and informed consent form. Subjects can enrol in COVID-RED if they comply with the following inclusion and exclusion criteria. Resident of the Netherlands. At least 18 years old. Informed consent provided (electronic). Willing to adhere to the study procedures described in the protocol. Must have a smartphone that runs at least Android 8.0 or iOS 13.0 operating systems and is active for the duration of the study (in the case of a change of mobile number, study team should be notified). Be able to read, understand and write Dutch. Previous positive SARS-CoV-2 test result (confirmed either through PCR/antigen or antibody tests; self-reported). Previously received a vaccine developed specifically for COVID-19 or in possession of an appointment for vaccination in the near future (self-reported). Current suspected (e.g., waiting for test result) COVID-19 infection or symptoms of a COVID-19 infection (self-reported). Participating in any other COVID-19 clinical drug, vaccine, or medical device trial (self-reported). Electronic implanted device (such as a pacemaker; self-reported). Pregnant at time of informed consent (self-reported). Suffering from cholinergic urticaria (per the Ava bracelet’s User Manual; self-reported). Staff involved in the management or conduct of this study. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: All subjects will be instructed to complete the Daily Symptom Diary in the Ava COVID-RED app daily, wear their Ava bracelet each night and synchronise it with the app each day for the entire period of study participation. Provided with wearable sensor and/or self-reported symptom data within the last 24 hours, the Ava COVID-RED app’s underlying algorithms will provide subjects with a real-time indicator of their overall health and well-being. Subjects will see one of three messages, notifying them that: no seeming deviations in symptoms and/or physiological parameters have been detected; some changes in symptoms and/or physiological parameters have been detected and they should self-isolate; or alerting them that deviations in their symptoms and/or physiological parameters could be suggestive of a potential COVID-19 infection and to seek additional testing. We will assess intraperson performance of the algorithms in the experimental condition (Wearable + Symptom Data Algo) and control conditions (Symptom Only Algo). MAIN OUTCOMES: The trial will evaluate the use and performance of the Ava COVID-RED app and Ava bracelet, which uses sensors to measure breathing rate, pulse rate, skin temperature, and heart rate variability for the purpose of early and asymptomatic detection and monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 in general and high-risk populations. Using laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections (detected via serology tests, PCR tests and/or antigen tests) as the gold standard, we will determine the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for each of the following two algorithms to detect first-time SARS-CoV-2 infection including early or asymptomatic infection: the algorithm using Ava Bracelet data when coupled with the self-reported Daily Symptom Diary data, and the algorithm using self-reported Daily Symptom Diary data alone. In addition, we will determine which of the two algorithms has superior performance characteristics for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection including early or asymptomatic infection as confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 virus testing. The protocol contains an additional seventeen secondary outcomes which address infection incidence rates, health resource utilization, symptoms reported by SARS-CoV-2 infected participants, and the rate of breakthrough and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections among individuals vaccinated against COVID-19. PCR or antigen testing will occur when the subject receives a notification from the algorithm to seek additional testing. Subjects will be advised to get tested via the national testing programme, and report the testing result in the Ava COVID-RED app and a survey. If they cannot obtain a test via the national testing programme, they will receive a nasal swab self-sampling kit at home, and the sample will be tested by PCR in a trial-affiliated laboratory. In addition, all subjects will be asked to take a capillary blood sample at home at baseline (Month 0), and at the end of the Learning Phase (Month 3), Period 1 (Month 6) and Period 2 (Month 9). These samples will be used for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody testing in a trial-affiliated laboratory, differentiating between antibodies resulting from a natural infection and antibodies resulting from COVID-19 vaccination (as vaccination will gradually be rolled out during the trial period). Baseline samples will only be analysed if the sample collected at the end of the Learning Phase is positive, and samples collected at the end of Period 1 will only be analysed if the sample collected at the end of Period 2 is positive. When subjects obtain a positive PCR/antigen or serology test result during the study, they will continue to be in the study but will be moved into a so-called “COVID-positive” mode in the Ava COVID-RED app. This means that they will no longer receive recommendations from the algorithms but can still contribute and track symptom and bracelet data. The primary analysis of the main objective will be executed using data collected in Period 2 (Month 6 through 9). Within this period, serology tests (before and after Period 2) and PCR/antigen tests (taken based on recommendations by the algorithms) will be used to determine if a subject was infected with SARS-CoV-2 or not. Within this same time period, it will be determined if the algorithms gave any recommendations for testing. The agreement between these quantities will be used to evaluate the performance of the algorithms and how these compare between the study conditions. RANDOMISATION: All eligible subjects will be randomized using a stratified block randomization approach with an allocation ratio of 1:1 to one of two sequences (experimental condition followed by control condition or control condition followed by experimental condition). Based on demographics, medical history and/or profession, each subject will be stratified at baseline into a high-risk and normal-risk group within each sequence, resulting in equal numbers of high-risk and normal-risk individuals between the sequences. BLINDING (MASKING): In this study, subjects will be blinded as to study condition and randomization sequence. Relevant study staff and the device manufacturer will be aware of the assigned sequence. The subject will wear the Ava bracelet and complete the Daily Symptom Diary in the Ava COVID-RED app for the full duration of the study, and they will not know if the feedback they receive about their potential infection status will only be based on data they entered in the Daily Symptom Diary within the Ava COVID-RED app or based on both the data from the Daily Symptom Diary and the Ava bracelet. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): 20,000 subjects will be recruited and randomized 1:1 to either Sequence 1 (experimental condition followed by control condition) or Sequence 2 (control condition followed by experimental condition), taking into account their risk level. This results in approximately 6,500 normal-risk and 3,500 high-risk individuals per sequence.

Although the disease is known to represent a significant public health problem among these populations, little epidemiological data exists on the subject. This study aims to provide information on malaria incidence, geospatial clustering, and risk factors associated to Plasmodium falciparum infection among these groups. METHODS: This is a descriptive study based on the analysis of published and unpublished programmatic data collected by Venezuelan health authorities and non-government organizations between 2014 and 2018. The Annual Parasite Index among indigenous groups (API-i) in municipalities of three states (Amazonas, Bolivar, and Sucre) were calculated and compared using the Kruskal Wallis test, risk factors for Plasmodium falciparum infection were identified via binomial logistic regression and maps were constructed to identify clusters of malaria cases among indigenous patients via Moran’s I and Getis-Ord’s hot spot analysis. RESULTS: 116,097 cases of malaria in Amerindian groups were registered during the study period. An increasing trend was observed between 2014 and 2016 but reverted in 2018. Malaria incidence remains higher than in 2014 and hot spots were identified in the three states, although more importantly in the south of Bolivar. Most cases (73.3%) were caused by Plasmodium vivax, but the Hoti, Yanomami, and Eñepa indigenous groups presented higher odds for infection with Plasmodium falciparum. CONCLUSION: Malaria cases among Amerindian populations increased between 2014 and 2018 and seem to have a different geographic distribution than those among the general population. These findings suggest that tailored interventions will be necessary to curb the impact of malaria transmission in these groups.

Even in high-income countries sepsis causes about 8% of admissions to pediatric intensive care units (PICUs). Early diagnosis, rapid anti-infective treatment, and prompt hemodynamic stabilization are crucial for patient survival. In this context, it is essential to identify the causative pathogen as soon as possible to optimize antimicrobial treatment. To date, culture-based diagnostic procedures (e.g., blood cultures) represent the standard of care. However, they have 2 major problems: on the one hand, in the case of very small sample volumes (and thus usually in children), they are not sufficiently sensitive. On the other hand, with a time-to-result of 2 to 5 days, blood cultures need a relatively long time for the anti-infective therapy to be calculated. To overcome these problems, culture-independent molecular diagnostic procedures such as unbiased sequence analysis of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from plasma samples of septic patients by next-generation sequencing (NGS) have been tested successfully in adult septic patients. However, these results still need to be transferred to the pediatric setting. METHODS: The Next GeneSiPS-Trial is a prospective, observational, non-interventional, multicenter study used to assess the diagnostic performance of an NGS-based approach for the identification of causative pathogens in (preterm and term) neonates (d1–d28, n = 50), infants (d29 to <1 yr, n = 50), and toddlers (1 yr to <5 yr, n = 50) with suspected or proven severe sepsis or septic shock (according to the pediatric sepsis definition) by the use of the quantitative sepsis indicating quantifier (SIQ) score in comparison to standard of care (culture-based) microbiological diagnostics. Potential changes in anti-infective treatment regimens based on these NGS results will be estimated retrospectively by a panel of 3 independent clinical specialists. DISCUSSION: Neonates, infants, and young children are significantly affected by sepsis. Fast and more sensitive diagnostic approaches are urgently needed. This prospective, observational, non-interventional, multicenter study seeks to evaluate an NGS-based approach in critically ill children suffering from sepsis.

Here, we developed a network-based algorithm, LncTx, to repurpose the medications that potentially act on survival-related lncRNAs in lung cancer. We used eight survival-related lncRNAs derived from our previous study to test the efficacy of this method. LncTx calculates the shortest path length (proximity) between the drug targets and the lncRNA-correlated proteins in the protein–protein interaction network (interactome). LncTx contains seven different proximity measures, which are calculated in the unweighted or weighted interactome. First, to test the performance of LncTx in predicting correct indication of drugs, we benchmarked the proximity measures based on the accuracy of differentiating anticancer drugs from non-anticancer drugs. The closest proximity weighted by clustering coefficient (closestCC) has the best performance (AUC around 0.8) compared to other proximity measures across all survival-related lncRNAs. The majority of the other six proximity measures have decent performance as well, with AUC greater than 0.7. Second, to evaluate whether LncTx can repurpose the drugs effectively acting on the lncRNAs, we clustered the drugs according to their proximities by hierarchical clustering. The drugs with smaller proximity (proximal drugs) were proved to be more effective than the drugs with larger proximity (distal drugs). In conclusion, LncTx enables us to accurately identify anticancer drugs and can potentially be an index to repurpose effective agents acting on survival-related lncRNAs in lung cancer.","Li, Albert; Huang, Hsuan-Ting; Huang, Hsuan-Cheng; Juan, Hsueh-Fen",Comput Struct Biotechnol J,353,27

Thromboembolic complications (TeC) are common in VA-ECMO patients and are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Valid markers to predict TeC in VA-ECMO patients are lacking. The present study investigated the predictive value of baseline Fibrinogen–Albumin-Ratio (FAR) for in-hospital TeC in patients undergoing VA-ECMO. This retrospective cohort study included patients who underwent VA-ECMO therapy due to cardiogenic shock at the University Hospital Duesseldorf, Germany between 2011 and 2018. Main exposure was baseline FAR measured at initiation of VA-ECMO therapy. The primary endpoint was the in-hospital incidence of TeC. In total, 344 patients were included into analysis (74.7% male, mean age 59 ± 14 years). The in-hospital incidence of TeC was 34%. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve of FAR for in-hospital TeC revealed an area under the curve of 0.67 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61–0.74]. Youden index determined a cutoff of 130 for baseline FAR. Multivariate logistic regression revealed an adjusted odds-ratio of 3.72 [95% CI 2.26–6.14] for the association between FAR and TeC. Baseline FAR is independently associated with in-hospital TeC in patients undergoing VA-ECMO. Thus, FAR might contribute to the prediction of TeC in this cohort.","Roth, Sebastian; Jansen, Catrin; M’Pembele, René; Stroda, Alexandra; Boeken, Udo; Akhyari, Payam; Lichtenberg, Artur; Hollmann, Markus W.; Huhn, Ragnar; Lurati Buse, Giovanna; Aubin, Hug",Sci Rep,353,8

South Korea has the highest mobile phone penetration rate as well as the highest rate of suicide of any of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) nations, thus making this study of great importance. The core aim was to see whether the excessive use of smartphones has an association with sleeping disorders and depression. A cross-sectional analysis was performed to establish if there was any link between smartphone use and sleeping disorders and depression. Samples from 188 participants were used for this study. Data were collected using two well-established questionnaires, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) and the Athene Insomnia Scale (AIS), as well as a few questions on smartphone use. A few demographic questions were added to the questionnaire. The results of this study concluded that a significant relationship exists between smartphone use and depression. However, the finding of this research could not uncover a significant relationship between smartphone use and sleeping disorders among university students in South Korea. The excessive use of smartphones shows a relationship to an unhealthy lifestyle. There is a clear indication that the overuse of smartphones could be linked to depression.

However, growing human populations (particularly in mega-cities), urbanisation and socio-economic disparity threaten opportunities for people to engage and connect directly with ocean environments. Thus, a major challenge in engaging the whole of society in achieving ocean sustainability by 2030 is to develop strategies to improve societal connections to the ocean. The concept of ocean literacy reflects public understanding of the ocean, but is also an indication of connections to, and attitudes and behaviours towards, the ocean. Improving and progressing global ocean literacy has potential to catalyse the behaviour changes necessary for achieving a sustainable future. As part of the Future Seas project (https://futureseas2030.org/), this paper aims to synthesise knowledge and perspectives on ocean literacy from a range of disciplines, including but not exclusive to marine biology, socio-ecology, philosophy, technology, psychology, oceanography and human health. Using examples from the literature, we outline the potential for positive change towards a sustainable future based on knowledge that already exists. We focus on four drivers that can influence and improve ocean literacy and societal connections to the ocean: (1) education, (2) cultural connections, (3) technological developments, and (4) knowledge exchange and science-policy interconnections.

Our patient presented during the COVID19 pandemic, which further blurred our diagnostic sense. Clinical Case: A 26-year-old female presented with sudden intractable non-bloody non-bilious vomiting occurring every 30 minutes along with sharp epigastric pain radiating to her back, dizziness, and extreme fatigue for the last 2 days. She had similar but milder episodes in the past 2–3 years as well and endorsed unintentional weight loss for the same duration. She had been extensively investigated previously but was misdiagnosed as gastroparesis or anxiety and was prescribed medications for the same (pantoprazole, sucralfate, and Lexapro). On presentation this time, she was hypotensive and tachycardic but partially responsive to IV fluids. Her BMI was 15.31 and the abdominal exam was benign. Her basic labs showed Na 125, K 4.9, Calcium 10.5, Cr 1, WBCs 9K, lipase 8, normal LFTs, TSH 6.96, Free T4 1.18. Infectious workup was done and the patient was started on empirical antibiotics. Negative infectious workup, hypotension partially responsive to IV fluid, along with hyponatremia and borderline high potassium level prompted us to check Cortisol. We found Cortisol of 1.3(very low for the degree of her illness). ACTH stimulation test with 250mcg IV cosyntropin showed cortisol of 1.3 at 30 minutes and 1.1 at 60 minutes confirming the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency. Further workup revealed a positive 21 hydroxylase antibody and ACTH level of 322 (high due to lack of negative feedback to the pituitary). She was comprehensively tested for other autoimmune diseases which showed positive Endomysial IgA and Tissue Transglutaminase antibodies indicating asymptomatic celiac disease. She improved drastically after starting hydrocortisone. TSH was repeated in 3 months which was normal. Conclusion: The onset of chronic adrenal insufficiency is very gradual with vague presentation and it may go undetected unless illness or other stress precipitates acute crisis as in our patient. Since autoimmune adrenalitis is the most common cause of primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison’s disease), patients with a confirmed diagnosis should also undergo workup for other autoimmune diseases.","Banjade, Rabin; Upadhyay, Binayak; Kharel, Bidhisa",J Endocr Soc,353,1

However, barring genomics, no other omics technology has been able to find utility in clinical settings. The recent advancements in mass spectrometry instrumentation have resulted in proteomics technologies becoming more sensitive and reliable. Targeted proteomics, a relatively new branch of mass spectrometry-based proteomics has shown immense potential in addressing the shortcomings of the standard molecular biology-based techniques like Western blotting and Immunohistochemistry. In this study we demonstrate the utility of Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM), a targeted proteomics approach, in quantifying peptides from proteins like Apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1), Apolipoprotein E (APOE), Prostaglandin H2 D-Isomerase (PTGDS), Vitronectin (VTN) and Complement C3 (C3) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collected from Glioma and Meningioma patients. Additionally, we also report transitions for peptides from proteins – Vimentin (VIM), Cystatin-C (CST3) and Clusterin (CLU) in surgically resected Meningioma tissues; Annexin A1 (ANXA1), Superoxide dismutase (SOD2) and VIM in surgically resected Glioma tissues; and Microtubule associated protein-2 (MAP-2), Splicing factor 3B subunit 2 (SF3B2) and VIM in surgically resected Medulloblastoma tissues. To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting the use of MRM to validate proteins from three types of brain malignancies and two different bio-specimens. Future studies involving a large cohort of samples aimed at accurately detecting and quantifying peptides of proteins with roles in brain malignancies could potentially result in a panel of proteins showing ability to classify and grade tumors. Successful application of these techniques could ultimately offer alternative strategies with increased accuracy, sensitivity and lower turnaround time making them translatable to the clinics.","Ghantasala, Saicharan; Pai, Medha Gayathri J.; Biswas, Deeptarup; Gahoi, Nikita; Mukherjee, Shuvolina; KP, Manubhai; Nissa, Mehar Un; Srivastava, Alisha; Epari, Sridhar; Shetty, Prakash; Moiyadi, Aliasgar; Srivastava, Sanjeeva",Front Oncol,353,1

By understanding how to transfer models (and to what extent), planning agencies in large countries like India can save freight survey costs in regions where they lack the institutional capacity and resources. Due to geographically sprawling nature of most of the Indian cities, an important research question regarding transferability is whether the models developed for urban areas can provide accurate estimates of freight activity in the suburban areas or vice versa. This paper aims to provide two solutions to this problem: (i) compare the relative effectiveness of transferability depending up on the direction of transfer and (ii) assess which models can be transferred and which cannot. Data collected from seven cities are used for this study. A set of freight production (FP) models are developed using this data to understand the differential influence of geographical location and industry segment on the model coefficients. The estimated FP models show that suburban establishments exhibit significantly higher FP rates as compared to other establishments. Subsequently, transferability direction and accuracy are determined using standard metrics such as transfer R(2), relative aggregate transfer error and transfer index. The transferability findings will provide actionable insights into development of FP models in regions with data constraints, which is of great value in an era of declining budgets for travel surveys.","Balla, Bhavani Shankar; Sahu, Prasanta K.; Pani, Agnivesh",J,353,19

To date, evidence on determinants, prevalence, and trends of undernutrition and anemia for the entire West and Central African region is missing. This paper provides evidence on trends and levels of adolescent anemia and undernutrition in West and Central Africa. METHODS: We pooled all Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) for West and Central African countries that were conducted between 1986 and 2017 to analyze levels and trends of adolescent anemia and undernutrition. We investigated the association of adolescent undernutrition and anemia within this region with World Bank income level classification of the country. RESULTS: Our findings suggest that the regional prevalence of adolescent anemia and undernutrition remained high at 45% and 19% respectively over the last 20 years. Anemia increased in about one third of countries and undernutrition in about two thirds over the studied period. On the aggregated level, these trends are largely masked and both levels remained stable in the entire region between the years 1998 and 2017. The results of the multivariable regression analysis indicate an association of adolescence with undernutrition and anemia, which was independent of socio-economic factors such as income, education, and place of residence. CONCLUSION: We conclude that levels of adolescent undernutrition and anemia remain high with little progress over the last 20 years and that adolescence is a significant correlate of both anemia and undernutrition. Given the recognition of the international community that adolescent nutrition is an important public health concern in resource-poor settings, there is an urgent need to improve data availability, quality, and use for decision-making and to design successful high-impact interventions to combat adolescent malnutrition in low- and middle-income countries.","Le Dain, Anne-Sophie; Sagalova, Vera; Sodjinou, Roger; Tou, El Hassane; Ntambi, John; Vollmer, Sebastian; Zagre, Noel Marie",,353,1

Methods: PubMed, Scopus, Medline, and Google Scholar databases were search for relevant articles, and the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing the risk of bias in randomized trials was used for transparent reporting of the methodological quality of each selected study. Results: The search of electronic databases identified 18 reports based on rigorous inclusion criteria. Single-session therapy was found superior to no treatment in reducing anxiety symptoms, and similar results were observed while comparing SST to multi-treatment sessions. Discussion: The findings support the benefits of SST in enhancing cognitive, behavioral, and psychological outcomes in both youth and adults suffering from anxiety disorders across treatment conditions and approaches, SST thus appears to be a promising way of providing access to both private and public therapeutic services efficiently and cost-effectively.

The biological role of this protease is still unclear, but for the alphaherpesvirus Marek's disease virus, its USP is involved in T-cell lymphoma formation. We here study the role of the MHV-68 USP, encoded by ORF64. By constructing a mutant virus with a single cysteine-to-alanine replacement in the active site of ORF64, we demonstrate that the USP activity of ORF64 is abolished. The mutant virus replicates less efficiently in vitro, and plaque size is reduced compared to that of a revertant virus. Electron microscopy of infected cells did not reveal any obvious differences in virion morphogenesis or differences in egress for the mutant and revertant viruses. Intraperitoneal infection of C57/BL6 mice demonstrates that the mutant virus is generally cleared by day 7, indicating a role for the USP in the persistence of MHV-68 infection or efficient replication. However, the USP activity in MHV-68 is unlikely to be involved in the establishment of latency or reactivation, since we observed no significant difference in viral DNA genome copy number in the spleen or in the number of cells that reactivate MHV-68 from latency. Our results for MHV-68 ORF64 are consistent with an enzymatic function of the tegument protein that is beneficial to the virus during acute infection, particularly in vivo.","Gredmark-Russ, Sara; Isaacson, Marisa K; Kattenhorn, Lisa; Cheung, Evelyn J; Watson, Nicki; Ploegh, Hidde L",Journal of virology,353,26

There is a growing body of evidence suggesting a similar entity in adults (MIS-A). We report a case of a young adult with a hyperinflammatory systemic syndrome with end-organ lesions and a recent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods and Procedures The patient developed end-organ lesions in the respiratory, cardiovascular, digestive, haematological and mucocutaneous systems. A wide diagnostic work-up did not find any specific aetiology (autoimmunity, neoplastic or infectious). There was evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection with positive autoimmune titres (positive IgG). A presumptive diagnosis of MIS-A was made and treatment with corticosteroids was introduced with improvement. Discussion COVID-19-related multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults is still an unknown entity with no diagnostic criteria or treatment guidelines. Much of what is known is inferred from what we already know about MIS-C. There have been several reported cases with severity ranging from mild to severe.

MATERIAL AND METHODS All patients diagnosed with high risk endometrial cancer during the study period were identified (n = 212). Clinical prospective data, with reassessment of lymphatic complications, was analysed for all cases (n = 140) planned for a complete robotic nodal staging. The outcome measures were: success rate of infrarenal paraaortic lymphadenectomy, the rate of lymphatic complications and factors associated with nodal yield. RESULTS Of the 212 women, an open or restricted robotic procedure was performed in 57 women (27%) and no operation in 15 (7%), the latter due to disseminated disease or comorbidity. In 140 women (66%) in whom staging was intended, the lymphadenectomy included the infrarenal area in 70%, was restricted to the inframesenteric area in 21% and aborted or incomplete in 9%. The median number of paraaortic nodes was 10 (range 2-39). An unsuccessful staging was associated with high BMI and the surgeon's inexperience. At 1 year, three patients (2%) had developed a grade two lower limb lymphedema. Eleven women (8%) demonstrated pelvic lymphocysts; seven (64%) resolved spontaneously. Only one paraaortic lymphocyst was found; this required drainage. No cases of chylous ascites occurred. CONCLUSIONS An infrarenal robotic paraaortic lymphadenectomy is feasible in 70% of high risk endometrial cancer cases when intended (88% in non-obese patients operated by experienced surgeons), but is restricted in obese patients and by surgeon's inexperience.","Geppert, Barbara; Persson, Jan",Acta obstetricia et gynecologica Scandinavica,353,5

Conversely, dual immunomodulation may weaken anti-viral responses and delay viral clearance, allowing SARS-CoV-2 to expand its population and accrue genetic diversity within individual hosts. Generating a pool of hosts with genetically diverse viral populations while introducing new selective pressures in the form of vaccination-induced immunity, could accelerate the process of antigenic drift in SARS-CoV-2. However, clinical trials to date have largely disregarded viral outcomes, and data on viral kinetics in response to immunomodulation is scarce.

However, the ability of fluoroscopy to determine lead positions in a standard ventricular segmentation is unknown. We aimed to evaluate the accuracy and reproducibility of fluoroscopy to determine LV and RV lead positions in CRT when compared with cardiac computed tomography (CT). METHODS AND RESULTS Fifty-nine patients undergoing CRT were included. Bi-plane fluoroscopy and cardiac CT were evaluated in all patients. Pacing lead positions were assessed in a standard LV 16-segment model and in a simplistic RV 8-segment model. Four patients with LV lead displacement were excluded from the agreement analysis of LV lead position. Agreement of LV lead position between fluoroscopy and cardiac CT was observed in 19 (35%) patients with fluoroscopy demonstrating a 1-segment and ≥2-segment error in 30 (55%) and 6 (11%) patients, respectively. Agreement of RV lead position was found in 13 (22%) patients with fluoroscopy showing a 1-segment and ≥ 2-segment error in 28 (47%) and 18 (31%) patients, respectively. The interobserver agreement on LV and RV lead positions was poor for fluoroscopy (kappa 0.20 and 0.23, respectively) and excellent for cardiac CT (kappa 0.87 and 0.85, respectively). CONCLUSION Fluoroscopy is inaccurate and modestly reproducible when assessing LV and RV lead positions in a standard ventricular segmentation when compared with cardiac CT. Cardiac CT should be applied to determine the exact pacing site in future research evaluating the optimal pacing lead position in CRT.","Sommer, Anders; Kronborg, Mads Brix; Nørgaard, Bjarne Linde; Gerdes, Christian; Mortensen, Peter Thomas; Nielsen, Jens Cosedis","Europace : European pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac electrophysiology : journal of the working groups on cardiac pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac cellular electrophysiology of the European Society of Cardiology",353,1

In this study, antibacterial activity was evaluated for six dihydrochalcone compounds from Malus. Phloretin and 3-hydroxyphloretin exhibited antibacterial effects on both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and the antibacterial capacity of these compounds was greater than that of their glycosylated derivatives. Within a certain range, dihydrochalcone hydrophobicity was positively correlated with antibacterial activity. Additionally, glycosylation at the 2'-position of the A-ring and hydroxyl group at the 3-position of the B-ring played a key role in the antibacterial activity of dihydrochalcones. Phloretin and 3-hydroxyphloretin caused damage to bacterial cells by significantly increasing protein and inorganic phosphate leakage. Compared to phloretin, 3-hydroxyphloretin exhibited a smaller effect on Gram-positive Micrococcus luteus and a greater effect on Gram-negative Klebsiella pneumoniae, suggesting different antibacterial mechanisms. At a low dihydrochalcone concentration, the respiration of M. luteus did not change, while membrane permeability increased significantly. These results indicate that the antibacterial mechanism of M. luteus was primarily damage to the cell membrane. However, damage to respiration and the cell membrane might occur simultaneously in K. pneumoniae, suggesting that the antibacterial mechanism of dihydrochalcones also depends on strain type. This study demonstrated the broad-spectrum antibacterial properties of dihydrochalcone compounds commonly found in the genus Malus to foodborne pathogens and elucidated the antibacterial mechanisms. It provides theoretical guidance for future research and application of dihydrochalcones in the food industry.","Wang, Jinxiao; Yang, Ruijia; Xiao, Zhengcao; Xu, Qipeng; Li, Pengmin; Ma, Fengwang",Food & function,353,30

METHODS Patients with cervical node-negative NPC treated with IMRT at the Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center between February 2001 and December 2008 were retrospectively reviewed. The failure patterns, prognostic factors, and efficacy of additional chemotherapy were assessed. RESULTS The median follow-up time was 78 months for 298 patients. The 5-year local recurrence-free survival (LRFS), nodal recurrence-free survival (NRFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), failure-free survival (FFS), and overall survival (OS) were 95.2%, 99.3%, 94.8%, 89.8%, and 92.9%, respectively. The rate of treatment failure remained high in patients with T4 disease (35.4%, 17/48), including eight of local recurrence, two of nodal recurrence, and seven of distant metastasis. Multivariate analyses showed that the primary gross tumor volume (GTVp) was significantly associated with LRFS, DMFS, FFS, and OS. Subgroup analysis revealed that patients with GTVp ≤ 42.5 cc had better 5-year LRFS (98.7% vs 81.4%, P < .001), 5-year DMFS (97.8% vs 82.5%, P < .001), 5-year FFS (96.1% vs 65.4%, P < .001), and 5-year OS (96.6% vs 78.2%, P < .001) than patients with GTVp > 42.5 cc. However, additional chemotherapy showed no significant survival benefit in stratification analysis. CONCLUSIONS Cervical node-negative NPC has a good prognosis in the IMRT era, and the primary tumor volume is the most important prognostic factor.

The results showed that infected (symptomatic) seed had a 5.5% greater Seed Index (based on 100 seed weight) when compared to non-infected (non-symptomatic, as control) seed. Non-infected seed had greater percent germination and seedling vigor when compared to infected seed. Germination was 30.9% greater and vigor was 58.3% greater in non-infected seed. Also, the results showed that infected seed with PSS had higher protein content and some amino acids. No changes in total oil and fatty acids. Sucrose and stachyose were lower in infected seed than in non-infected seed. The research showed that PSS impacted seed health and seed quality (germination and vigor) and seed composition (protein, sugars, and some amino acids). Purple stained seed should be avoided when planting and should be managed properly as low germination is a potential risk. Planting population should be adjusted accordingly due to lack of germination and vigor if PSS is present. This research help growers for purple seed management, and scientists to further understand the potential negative impact on seed quality and nutrition. Further research is needed before conclusive recommendations are made.","Turner, Richard E; Ebelhar, M Wayne; Wilkerson, Teresa; Bellaloui, Nacer; Golden, Bobby R; Irby, J Trenton; Martin, Steve",Plants,353,1

Although qPCR is used to detect antigen during the acute disease phase, there is no equine-specific antibody test available to study EqCoV seroprevalence in various horse populations. We developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) targeting antibodies to the spike (S) protein of EqCoV and validated its use, using acute and convalescent sera from 83 adult horses involved in 6 outbreaks. The EqCoV S protein-based ELISA was able to reliably detect antibodies to EqCoV in naturally infected horses. The greatest seroconversion rate was observed in horses with clinical signs compatible with EqCoV infection and EqCoV qPCR detection in feces. The EqCoV S protein-based ELISA could be used effectively for seroepidemiologic studies in order to better characterize the overall infection rate of EqCoV in various horse populations.","Kooijman, Lotte J; Mapes, Samantha M; Pusterla, Nicola","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",353,7

We previously reported decreased CypA levels in hepatocytes of transgenic mice expressing hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen (HBsAg). In this study, we found that expression of HBV small surface protein (SHBs) in human hepatoma cell lines specifically triggered CypA secretion, whereas SHBs added extracellularly to culture medium did not. Moreover, CypA secretion was not promoted by the expression of a secretion deficient SHBs mutant, suggesting a close association between secretion of CypA and SHBs. Interaction between CypA and SHBs was observed by using coimmunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays. Hydrodynamic injection of the SHBs expression construct into C57BL/6J mice resulted in increased serum CypA levels and ALT/AST levels, as well as the infiltration of inflammatory cells surrounding SHBs-positive hepatocytes. The inflammatory response and serum ALT/AST level were reduced when the chemotactic effect of CypA was inhibited by cyclosporine and anti-CD147 antibody. Furthermore, higher serum CypA levels were detected in chronic hepatitis B patients than in healthy individuals. In HBV patients who had received liver transplantation, serum CypA levels declined dramatically after the loss of HBsAg as a consequence of liver transplantation. Taken together, these results indicate that expression and secretion of SHBs can promote CypA secretion, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of HBV infection.","Tian, Xiaochen; Zhao, Chao; Zhu, Hongguang; She, Weimin; Zhang, Jiming; Liu, Jing; Li, Lanjuan; Zheng, Shusen; Wen, Yu-Mei; Xie, Youhua",Journal of virology,353,1

We report a case underwent laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal (TEP) treatment for a hydrocele of the canal of Nuck extending in the extraperitoneal space mainly. PRESENTATION OF CASE A 37-year-old woman complained of painless and reducible swelling in her left groin, and referred to our hospital for surgical management against left inguinal hernia with the incarcerated ovary. Ultrasonography and MR images revealed a cystic mass in the retroperitoneal space, and we diagnosed as an unusual type of hydrocele of the canal of Nuck. The patient was scheduled for laparoscopic treatment. Laparoscopic findings on pneumoperitoneum showed an extraperitoneal cystic tumor with no contact with the left ovary. The fascia and peritoneum of the port site were closed, and then an extraperitoneal space was created. The cystic tumor with the round ligament of the uterus was dissected and resected by the TEP technique. The extended deep inguinal ring was repaired with polypropylene mesh. Postoperative course was uneventful. DISCUSSION Hydrocele of the canal of Nuck in the adult female is a rare condition. The accurate diagnosis of an inguinal hydrocele in a female is seldom made. Laparoscopic examination provides surgeons with information of inguinal swelling accompanied with retroperitoneal cyst, and consecutive treatment by laparoscopic technique, especially TEP, is useful in regard to minimal damage of the peritoneum. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic diagnosis and TEP treatment offers a useful alternative in selected patients with hydrocele of the canal of Nuck.","Matsumoto, Toshifumi; Hara, Takao; Hirashita, Teijiro; Kubo, Nobuhide; Hiroshige, Shoji; Orita, Hiroyuki",International journal of surgery case reports,353,33

We hypothesized that MR imaging 4D flow and computational fluid dynamics would reveal distinct blood flow patterns in the venous outflow tract in these patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients with pulsatile tinnitus of suspected venous etiology underwent MR imaging at 3T, using venous phase contrast-enhanced MR angiography, 4D flow, and 2D phase contrast. The contrast-enhanced MRA contours were evaluated to determine the presence and extent of a sigmoid sinus diverticulum. Computational fluid dynamics analysis was performed using the 4D flow inlet flow and the luminal contours from contrast-enhanced MRA as boundary conditions. In addition, computational fluid dynamics was performed for the expected post treatment conditions by smoothing the venous geometry to exclude the sigmoid sinus diverticulum from the anatomic boundary conditions. Streamlines were generated from the 4D flow and computational fluid dynamics velocity maps, and flow patterns were examined for the presence of rotational components. RESULTS Twenty-five patients with pulsatile tinnitus of suspected venous etiology and 10 control subjects were enrolled. Five (20%) of the symptomatic subjects had sigmoid sinus diverticula, all associated with an upstream stenosis. In each of these patients, but none of the controls, a stenosis-related flow jet was directed toward the opening of the sigmoid sinus diverticulum with rotational flow patterns in the sigmoid sinus diverticulum and parent sigmoid sinus on both 4D flow and computational fluid dynamics. CONCLUSIONS Consistent patterns of blood flow can be visualized in a sigmoid sinus diverticulum and the parent sinus using 4D flow and computational fluid dynamics. Strong components of rotational blood flow were seen in subjects with sigmoid sinus diverticula that were absent in controls.","Amans, M R; Haraldsson, H; Kao, E; Kefayati, S; Meisel, K; Khangura, R; Leach, J; Jani, N D; Faraji, F; Ballweber, M; Smith, W; Saloner, D",AJNR.

Inhibitory and facilitatory mechanisms affect the perception of stimuli as painful or non-painful, and in addition may affect the perceived intensity of pain. Endogenous opioids are key mediators in the descending pain suppression pathways. Additionally, monoaminergic neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine, serotonin and dopamine positively or negatively modulate pain signaling, depending on receptor type and location. The various mediators involved in pain signaling provide potential targets for pharmacological interventions. Single analgesic therapies may be limited in their ability to comprehensively target these complex pain signaling pathways. Therapeutic approaches acting on multiple pain transmission pathways through different mechanisms of action provide an opportunity to maximize efficacy and tolerability in the treatment of pain. SCOPE This article discusses the various physiologic processes involved in pain signaling and modulation, describes the mechanisms by which various classes of analgesic agents are believed to produce their clinical effects, and explores the potential benefits of a multiple-mechanism approach to analgesia. Published articles describing the physiologic processes involved in pain signaling and modulation and the mechanisms of analgesia for different drug classes were reviewed. MEDLINE searches were conducted to identify relevant studies published through August 2009 that evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of multiple-mechanism analgesic regimens. English language-only randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials were considered. FINDINGS/CONCLUSION Multiple neurotransmitters and other mediators are involved in the endogenous modulation of pain signaling, providing numerous opportunities for intervention with different classes of analgesics. Data from numerous clinical trials indicate that multiple-mechanism approaches to analgesia provide comparable or superior analgesic efficacy with lower doses of the individual agents and reduced incidence of side effects. These data support current guidelines which endorse multiple-mechanism strategies for both acute and chronic pain management.","Argoff, Charles",Current medical research and opinion,353,1

Here we utilize electron tomography and other methods to investigate the remodeling of membranes in poliovirus-infected cells. We found that the viral replication structures previously described as ""vesicles"" are in fact convoluted, branching chambers with complex and dynamic morphology. They are likely to originate from cis-Golgi membranes and are represented during the early stages of infection by single-walled connecting and branching tubular compartments. These early viral organelles gradually transform into double-membrane structures by extension of membranous walls and/or collapsing of the luminal cavity of the single-membrane structures. As the double-membrane regions develop, they enclose cytoplasmic material. At this stage, a continuous membranous structure may have double- and single-walled membrane morphology at adjacent cross-sections. In the late stages of the replication cycle, the structures are represented mostly by double-membrane vesicles. Viral replication proteins, double-stranded RNA species, and actively replicating RNA are associated with both double- and single-membrane structures. However, the exponential phase of viral RNA synthesis occurs when single-membrane formations are predominant in the cell. It has been shown previously that replication complexes of some other positive-strand RNA viruses form on membrane invaginations, which result from negative membrane curvature. Our data show that the remodeling of cellular membranes in poliovirus-infected cells produces structures with positive curvature of membranes. Thus, it is likely that there is a fundamental divergence in the requirements for the supporting cellular membrane-shaping machinery among different groups of positive-strand RNA viruses.","Belov, George A; Nair, Vinod; Hansen, Bryan T; Hoyt, Forrest H; Fischer, Elizabeth R; Ehrenfeld, Ellie",Journal of virology,353,1

METHODS Eight pigs (all females; mean weight: 29 kg) underwent a conventional transperitoneal aortic approach with implantation of an aorto-prosthetic end-to-side anastomosis using a Clampless device and deployment of a 5-mm polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft. After proximal ligature, a conventional end-to-end anastomosis was then performed between the graft and the left iliac artery. RESULTS The first pig died during the procedure due to graft misplacement. The seven other procedures were successful with a mean operative and anastomosis time of 101 min (range: 81-115 min) and 3.35 min (range: 2.25-4.25 min), respectively; mean blood loss was 152 ml (range: 30-235 ml). Another pig with a patent graft died at day 4 as a result of a severe unrelated pneumonopathy. The angiogram performed during the procedure and before sacrifice, at 2 (n=2), 4 (n=2) and 6 weeks (n=2), showed no graft stenosis or thrombosis. Microscopic examination revealed a tissue covering the intraluminal stent, which evolved over time, with no visible endothelial proliferation or inflammation. CONCLUSION An aorto-prosthetic anastomosis can be performed safely and efficiently with our new clampless and sutureless device. The next step will be a laparoscopic Clampless implantation.","Alimi, Y S; Saint Lebes, B; Garitey, V; Afrapoli, A; Boufi, M; Hartung, O; Garcia, S; Mouret, F; Berdah, S",European journal of vascular and endovascular surgery : the official journal of the European Society for Vascular Surgery,353,16

METHODS Between December 17, 2003, and April 9, 2008, 68 consecutive patients (mean age, 68 y) with 94 pulmonary lesions, including metastases (n = 38) and primary lung cancers (n = 44), underwent RFA. Because of inadequate imaging follow-up in 12 patients, only 82 lesions were analyzed (CT scans, n = 82; (18)F-FDG PET/CT scans, n = 62). The median follow-up was 25 mo (range, 12-66 mo). A baseline study was defined as (18)F-FDG PET/CT performed no more than 3 mo before RFA. The first postablation scan was defined as PET/CT performed between 1 and 4 mo after RFA; additional follow-up studies were obtained in some cases between 6 and 12 mo after RFA. The unidimensional maximum diameter of the lesion was recorded on a pretherapy diagnostic CT scan or on the CT component of a pretherapy (18)F-FDG PET/CT scan, whichever was obtained most recently, using lung windows. Maximum standardized uptake values (SUVs) were recorded for all lesions imaged by (18)F-FDG PET/CT. (18)F-FDG uptake patterns on post-RFA scans were classified as favorable or unfavorable. Survival and recurrence probabilities were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Uni- and multivariate analyses were also performed. RESULTS Before RFA, factors predicting greater local recurrence-free survival included initial lesion size less than 3 cm (P = 0.01) and SUV less than 8 (P = 0.02), although the latter was not an independent predictor in multivariate analysis. Treated metastases recurred less often than treated primary lung cancers (P = 0.03). Important post-RFA factors that related to reduced recurrence-free survival included an unfavorable uptake pattern (P < 0.01), post-RFA SUV (P < 0.01), and an increase in SUV over time after ablation (P = 0.05). CONCLUSION (18)F-FDG PET/CT parameters on both preablation and postablation scans may predict local recurrence in patients treated with RFA for lung metastases and primary lung cancers.","Singnurkar, Amit; Solomon, Stephen B; Gönen, Mithat; Larson, Steven M; Schöder, Heiko","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",353,1

Racial disparities in maternal-child health persist. Despite national calls for workforce diversification, more than 90% of certified nurse-midwives are white. This systematic review examines how racism and midwifery's lack of racial diversity impact both midwives and their patients. METHODS Databases were searched in January 2016 for studies that explored 1) racially concordant or racially discordant maternity care provided, at least in part, by midwives; 2) women of color's experience of race and discrimination in maternity care provided, at least in part, by midwives; and 3) midwives of color's experience of race and discrimination in clinical, educational, and/or professional settings. Studies were excluded if they were conducted outside the United States, focused on recent immigrant populations, or didn't have an English-language abstract. Selected studies were each reviewed by 2 independent reviewers, and data from the studies were entered into literature tables and synthesized for discussion. RESULTS A total of 7 studies was retained for review-3 on the experience of patients and 4 on the experience of providers. The studies show racism is common in midwifery education, professional organizations, and clinical practices. Racism and midwifery's lack of racial diversity act as a barrier to people of color completing midwifery education programs and fully participating in midwifery professional organizations.

It is currently evaluated by the Conjunctival Provocation Test (CPT), which is considered as the gold standard. In the investigation of allergic rhinitis and asthma, environmental exposure chambers (EEC) are increasingly utilised. For allergic conjunctivitis, EEC might be a valid alternative to the CPT. However, evaluation of the allergen response in individual provocation tests or in EECs is still in discussion due to the multiplicity of symptom scores. Indeed, there are many scores used to evaluate allergic conjunctivitis. The main criteria used were described by Abelson in 1990 and include redness, itching, tearing, and swelling. In clinical studies, the specifically ocular score most used is the Total Ocular Symptom Score (TOSS). Few treatments have been evaluated by EEC, including cold compresses, epinastine and N-acetyl aspartyl glutamic acid. Moreover, early data shows good correlation between ocular symptoms induced in an EEC and those assessed during natural exposure.

In this study, we aimed to explore the targeting performance of 99mTc-PHC-102 in single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in patients with RCC, while also assessing the safety and tolerability of the radiotracer. Methods: We studied five patients with localized or metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) in a microdosing regimen, after the administration of 100 µg total CAIX ligand and 600-800 MBq 99mTc-PHC-102. Tissue distribution and residence time in normal organs and tumors were analysed by serial SPECT/CT scans at three time points (30 minutes, 2, and 6 hours) after intravenous administration. Results: In the five patients studied, 99mTc-PHC-102 was well tolerated and no study drug-related adverse events were recorded. The radiotracer showed a rapid initial uptake in the stomach, kidneys and gallbladder, which cleared over time. Localization of the study drug in primary tumors of five patients was observed with favourable tumour-to-background ratios. 99mTc-PHC-102-SPECT/CT allowed the identification of four previously unknown lung and lymph node metastases in two patients. Conclusion: 99mTc-PHC-102 is a promising SPECT tracer for the imaging of patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma.

In addition to their innate functions, EVs can be manipulated to be drug carriers and exert many biological functions. The composition of EVs, their intravesicular components, and the surrounding tumor microenvironment are closely related to the development of colorectal cancer. Determining the expression profiles of exocytosis samples and using them as indicators for selecting effective combination therapy is an indispensable direction for EV study and should be regarded as a novel prediction platform in addition to cancer stage, prognosis, and other clinical assessments.

Our best performing model was also successful in terms of out-of-sample prediction, tested on a dataset about HPV vaccination. CONCLUSION Automated classification of online content in terms of reliability, using basic classifiers, performs well and is particularly useful to identify reliable information. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS The classifiers can be used as a starting point to develop more complex classifiers, but also warning tools which can help people evaluate the content they encounter online.","Meppelink, Corine S; Hendriks, Hanneke; Trilling, Damian; van Weert, Julia C M; Shao, Anqi; Smit, Eline S",Patient education and counseling,353,20

Using data through April 20, 2020, we fit a statistical model to COVID-19 case fatality rates over time at the US county level to estimate the COVID-19 IFR among symptomatic cases (IFR-S) as time goes to infinity. The IFR-S in the US was estimated to be 1.3% (95% central credible interval: 0.6% to 2.1%). County-specific rates varied from 0.5% to 3.6%. The overall IFR for COVID-19 should be lower when we account for cases that remain and recover without symptoms. When used with other estimating approaches, our model and our estimates can help disease and policy modelers to obtain more accurate predictions for the epidemiology of the disease and the impact of alternative policy levers to contain this pandemic. The model could also be used with future epidemics to get an early sense of the magnitude of symptomatic infection at the population-level before more direct estimates are available. Substantial variation across patient demographics likely exists and should be the focus of future studies.

Although superior ion transport abilities have been reported for both types of ion-conducting polymers, their electrochemical performances are significantly different and the corresponding transport mechanisms at the electrolyte/electrode interface remain elusive. Here, we combine experimental and computational techniques to investigate the cathode interface in the presence of both functional polymer binders in comparison with the poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) binder as reference. A broad shoulder in the cyclic voltammogram accompanied by a poor rate performance of battery tests was observed for a LiFePO4 cathode with coordination-type ether-based polyimide (EPI) binder. In contrast, a LiFePO4 cathode with ion-type sulfonated polyimide (SPI) binder exhibits smaller concentration polarization, achieving satisfactory capacity at high current density. Simulations show that the ether-based binder strongly coordinates Li ions and thus slows the diffusion of Li ions. This leads to the reduction of the LIB electrochemical performance at a high C-rate. In contrast, the negative moiety of the SPI binder leads to less localization of Li ions, allowing a slightly higher Li-ion mobility. Conventional PVDF shows no affinity to Li ions, leading to less Li-ion accumulation at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Yet, the cathode surface covered with PVDF shows the lowest Li-ion diffusivity compared to those with the two types of Li-ion-conducting binders. Therefore, cathodes with SPI and PVDF binders show less polarization at the electrode interface and allow higher C-rate performance of LIBs. The combined results provide a comprehensive understanding of the mechanism of ion conduction in ion- and coordination-type Li-ion-conducting polymer binders. This gives valuable insight into the design of next-generation polymer materials for high-power LIBs.","Tsao, Chih-Hao; Yang, Tang-Kai; Chen, Kun-You; Fang, Chan-En; Ueda, Mitsuru; Richter, Felix H; Janek, Jürgen; Chiu, Chi-Cheng; Kuo, Ping-Lin",ACS applied materials & interfaces,353,17

However, there remain many gaps in detecting and treating NCDs in African health systems, and little is known about how NCDs are being managed among PLHIV. Developing integrated chronic care models that effectively prevent and treat NCDs among PLHIV requires an understanding of the current patterns of care delivery and the major barriers and facilitators to health care. We present a systematic review protocol to synthesize studies of healthcare delivery for an important subset of NCDs, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases (CMDs), among African PLHIV. METHODS/DESIGN We plan to search electronic databases and reference lists of relevant studies published in African settings from January 2003 to the present. Studies will be considered if they address one or both of our major objectives and focus on health care for one or more of six interrelated CMDs (ischemic heart disease, stroke, heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia) in PLHIV. Our first objective will be to estimate proportions of CMD patients along the ""cascade of care""-i.e., screened, diagnosed, aware of the diagnosis, initiated on treatment, adherent to treatment, and with controlled disease. Our second objective will be to identify unique barriers and facilitators to health care faced by PLHIV in African countries. For studies deemed eligible for inclusion, we will assess study quality and risk of bias using previously published criteria. We will extract study data using standardized instruments. We will meta-analyze quantitative data at each level of the cascade of care for each CMD (first objective). We will use meta-synthesis techniques to understand and integrate qualitative data on health-related behaviors (second objective). DISCUSSION CMDs and other NCDs are becoming major health concerns for African PLHIV. The results of our review will inform the development of research into chronic care models that integrate care for HIV/AIDS and CMDs among PLHIV. Our findings will be highly relevant to health policymakers, administrators, and practitioners in African settings.

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are significant biomarkers of HIV risk and should trigger preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) discussion. We reviewed STI testing practices outside of sexual health clinics to identify opportunities for improvement in the provision of HIV prevention services. METHODS An electronic sexual health dashboard was used to identify patient encounters with a positive gonorrhea, chlamydia, and/or rapid plasma reagin test result between January 1, 2019, and August 23, 2019, at a large urban academic medical center. A retrospective chart review was performed to assess HIV testing, completeness of STI screening, and HIV prevention discussion; inadequate screening was defined as no HIV test in 12 months before STI diagnosis. RESULTS A total of 815 patients with 856 patient encounters were included. Patients were predominantly female (64.4%); median age was 24 years (range, 18-85 years). The most common test and most common positive test result was the genitourinary gonorrhea/chlamydia nucleic acid amplification test. Multisite testing was rare (7.5% of patient encounters) and performed more frequently in men than in women (20.3% vs. 0.36%). Women were also more likely to be inadequately screened for HIV (15.1% vs. 25.8%).Documentation of PrEP discussion was rare (4.7% of patient encounters) compared with safe sex (44.6%) and condoms (49.8%). Preexposure prophylaxis was discussed almost exclusively with men compared with women (17% vs. 1.1%). CONCLUSIONS In patients diagnosed with bacterial STI outside of sexual health clinics, gaps in HIV prevention exist. HIV screening, multisite STI screening, and discussion of PrEP were particularly infrequent among women.","Yumori, Caitlin; Zucker, Jason; Theodore, Deborah; Chang, Michelle; Carnevale, Caroline; Slowikowski, Jacek; LaSota, Elijah; Olender, Susan; Gordon, Peter; Cohall, Alwyn; Sobieszczyk, Magdalena E",Sexually transmitted diseases,353,16

METHODS From 1994 to 2018, 552 patients underwent laparoscopic adrenalectomy, unilateral in 531 and bilateral in 21 patients (9 females and 12 males). All patients who underwent LBA were approached via a transperitoneal anterior route and form our study population. Indications included: Cushing's disease (n = 11), pheochromocytoma (n = 6), Conn's disease (n = 3) and adrenal cysts (n = 1). RESULTS Mean operative time was 195 ± 86.2 min (range 55-360 min). Conversion was necessary in one case for bleeding. Three patients underwent concurrent laparoscopic cholecystectomy with laparoscopic common bile duct exploration and ductal stone extraction in one. Three postoperative complications occurred in one patient each: subhepatic fluid collection, intestinal ileus and pleural effusion. Mean hospital stay was 6.1 ± 4.7 days (range 2-18 days). CONCLUSIONS In our experience, transperitoneal anterior LBA was feasible and safe. Based on our results, we believe that this approach leads to prompt recognition of anatomical landmarks with early division of the main adrenal vein prior to any gland manipulation, with a low risk of bleeding and without the need to change patient position. Unlike the lateral approach, there is no need to mobilize the spleno-pancreatic complex on the left or the liver on the right.

This commentary reporting from the field integrates perceptions of academic, community, health system, and policy leaders from state, county, and local levels in commenting on community mental health needs in the COVID-19 pandemic. Stakeholders noted the broad public health scope of mental health challenges while expressing concern about exacerbation of existing disparities in access and adverse social determinants, including for communities with high COVID-19 infection rates, such as African Americans and Latinos. They noted rapid changes toward telehealth and remote care, and the importance of understanding impacts of changes, including who may benefit or have limited access, with implications for future services delivery. Needs for expanded workforce and training in mental health were noted, as well as potential public health value of expanding digital resources tailored to local populations for enhancing resilience to stressors.

This study aimed to identify the delaying factors in door-to-needle time (DTN) in the emergency department of one of the largest comprehensive stroke centers in New York State. We also recommended measures to reduce the delays. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the medical charts of all AIS patients who received IVT in our emergency department patients between April 1, 2012 and December 31, 2015 to identify those with a DTN time of >60min. We categorized the factors causing the delay into different groups. For each group, we recommended measures to reduce the treatment delays. RESULTS A total of 487 patients received IVT for AIS during the 3.7-year period. Of these, 96 patients (20.4%) met our DTN time delay criteria. Delays for obtaining stroke imaging and hypertension control were the most common factors. Thirty eight patients (39.5%) had delay in obtaining CT-based stroke imaging. Twenty-two patients (22.9%) required control of elevated blood pressure prior to IVT.

Previously, we demonstrated that La interacts with the HCV internal ribosome entry site (IRES) around the GCAC motif near the initiator AUG within stem-loop IV by its RNA recognition motif (RRM) (residues 112 to 184) and influences HCV translation. In this study, we have deciphered the role of this interaction in HCV replication in a hepatocellular carcinoma cell culture system. We incorporated mutation of the GCAC motif in an HCV monocistronic subgenomic replicon and a pJFH1 construct which altered the binding of La and checked HCV RNA replication by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). The mutation drastically affected HCV replication. Furthermore, to address whether the decrease in replication is a consequence of translation inhibition or not, we incorporated the same mutation into a bicistronic replicon and observed a substantial decrease in HCV RNA levels. Interestingly, La overexpression rescued this inhibition of replication. More importantly, we observed that the mutation reduced the association between La and NS5B. The effect of the GCAC mutation on the translation-to-replication switch, which is regulated by the interplay between NS3 and La, was further investigated. Additionally, our analyses of point mutations in the GCAC motif revealed distinct roles of each nucleotide in HCV replication and translation. Finally, we showed that a specific interaction of the GCAC motif with human La protein is crucial for linking 5' and 3' ends of the HCV genome. Taken together, our results demonstrate the mechanism of regulation of HCV replication by interaction of the cis-acting element GCAC within the HCV IRES with human La protein.","Kumar, Anuj; Ray, Upasana; Das, Saumitra",Journal of virology,353,1

Subsequent hunting for novel coronaviruses (CoVs) led to the discovery of two additional human and over 40 animal CoVs, including the prototype lineage C betacoronaviruses, Tylonycteris bat CoV HKU4 and Pipistrellus bat CoV HKU5; these are phylogenetically closely related to the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) CoV, which has affected more than 1,000 patients with over 35% fatality since its emergence in 2012. All primary cases of MERS are epidemiologically linked to the Middle East. Some of these patients had contacted camels which shed virus and/or had positive serology. Most secondary cases are related to health care-associated clusters. The disease is especially severe in elderly men with comorbidities. Clinical severity may be related to MERS-CoV's ability to infect a broad range of cells with DPP4 expression, evade the host innate immune response, and induce cytokine dysregulation. Reverse transcription-PCR on respiratory and/or extrapulmonary specimens rapidly establishes diagnosis. Supportive treatment with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and dialysis is often required in patients with organ failure. Antivirals with potent in vitro activities include neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, antiviral peptides, interferons, mycophenolic acid, and lopinavir. They should be evaluated in suitable animal models before clinical trials.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of ultrasound-guided Transversus Abdominis Plane (TAP) block, performed before surgical incision, in providing postoperative analgesia for patients undergoing open ventral hernia repair under general anaesthesia. METHODS Seventy elective patients scheduled for open ventral hernia repair surgery under general anaesthesia were divided randomly into two equal groups: Group I received bilateral TAP block performed before surgical incision (n = 35); Group II received systemic postoperative analgesia with parenteral opioid (morphine) alone (n = 35). Postoperatively pain scores at rest and with movement, total morphine consumption and opioid related side effects were recorded. RESULTS Postoperative pain scores at rest and mobilization/cough were significantly higher in patients without TAP block (p < 0.05). Mean intraoperative fentanyl consumption was comparable between the two groups: 0.75 ± 0.31 mg in group I (TAP) and 0.86 ± 0.29 mg in group II (MO), p = 0.1299. Patients undergoing preincisional TAP block had reduced morphine requirements during the first 24 hours after surgery, compared to patients from group II, without TAP block (p = 0.0001). There was no difference in the incidence of opioid related side effects (nausea, vomiting) in the both groups during the first 24 postoperative hours. CONCLUSION The use of preincisional ultrasound guided TAP block reduced the pain scores at rest and with movement/cough, opioid consumption and opioid-related side effects after ventral hernia repair when compared with opioid-only analgesia.","Chesov, Ion; Belîi, Adrian",Romanian journal of anaesthesia and intensive care,353,1

Four suture techniques were employed (a) continuous loop, (b) interrupted loops, (c) interrupted edge sutures and (d) continuous running edge suture. Scanning electron microscopic imaging was performed on the 4 tubes sutured. Monofilament sutures were used for tube formation as braided sutures were unsuitable. Dry scaffolds demonstrated tears during knot tying and fractures when bent around a stent. The interrupted and continuous running edge suture were the most suitable suturing techniques in wet scaffolds; further confirmed by scanning electron microscopy imaging. Our approach to tissue engineer segments of the gastrointestinal tract involves cell-seeding on scaffolds to permit attachment in vitro and later wrapping of scaffold layers of heterogeneous cells to create composite tissue. Scaffolds in wet state can be better sutured with monofilament materials using either the interrupted or running continuous edge suture technique.","Soltysiak, Piotr; Höllwarth, Michael E; Saxena, Amulya K",Bio-medical materials and engineering,353,16

A major limitation in video capsule-related study is the lack of a validated objective score for bowel preparation quality. We aimed to design and validate a computed small bowel preparation score for research and clinical use. METHODS Two experienced physicians reached a consensus regarding bowel preparation quality based on known criteria used in previous studies and their confidence of an accurate medical interpretation of the procedure. A computed algorithm based on the pixels in the color bar was created and validated. Concordance between the gastroenterologists' agreement (gold standard) and the computed analysis was assessed. RESULTS Of 85 videos studied, 44 (52%), 13 (15%) and 28 (33%) had adequate, borderline and inadequate bowel preparation, respectively, according to the gastroenterologists' agreement. Computer analysis restricted to adequate and inadequate cases yielded accurate classification of bowel preparation in 65/72 cases (90% agreement, sensitivity 95%, specificity 82%, total accuracy 90%, Kappa 0.79). When adding the borderline definition, the computer analysis correctly classified 71/85 of the cases, yielding an overall agreement of 84% (Kappa 0.72). Minute-by-minute analysis of 10 cases also yielded an agreement of 91.4%. CONCLUSION The present study introduces a user-friendly computer analysis-based small bowel preparation score, which demonstrated excellent concordance with the physician's assessment. This score holds promise as a standardization tool in research and clinical practice of video capsule endoscopy.

Nowadays, laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal approach is gaining its validity and shows favorable outcomes. However, single-incision laparoscopic surgery is also widening its applicable fields as a new technique. This study aimed to find whether single-incision laparoscopic total extraperitoneal inguinal hernia repair (SILTEP) is applicable compared to conventional laparoscopic total extraperitoneal hernia repair (CLTEP). METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 120 cases of SILTEP and 60 cases of CLTEP in Yonsei University Severance Hospital from January 2012 to December 2013. Each group was compared with patients' characteristics, operative details, and postoperative complications. RESULTS There were no statistical difference in patient age, sex, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, hernia type, or location between SILTEP and CLTEP. In operative details, operation time (61.77 ± 16.48 minutes versus 77.83 ± 35.15 minutes, P = .001) was shorter in SILTEP. Postoperative complication rate has shown no statistical difference in SILTEP compared to CLTEP (n = 20, 16.7% versus n = 16, 26.7%, P = .114). CONCLUSIONS SILTEP is feasible and provides comparable postoperative outcomes compared to CLTEP. Although SILTEP has its own challenges for mastering the procedure, with some experiences, it is possible to operate as well as CLTEP.","Han, Yoon Dae; Park, Seungwan; Kim, Woo Ram; Baek, Se Jin; Hur, Hyuk; Min, Byung Soh; Kim, Nam Kyu",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

Precisely, the article deals at the statements made by its defenders. These revolve around the following concepts: dignity, right, freedom and, finally, pain-suffering. Human dignity is the individual and social principle par excellence and from which the other three are derived. For this reason, by defending the dignity that the human being possesses, simply, by the fact of being it, it is against said Law. Human dignity is not destroyed by terminal illness, or by dependency, suffering, weakness or frailty. Each human life has value in itself, which must be safeguarded and which makes it non-negotiable in all situations and conditions. That the non-negotiable value of life sustains any democratic system. However, the supposed right to euthanasia is typical of an individualistic and reductionist vision of the human being and his life; and of a freedom detached both from the goodness or badness of the choice and action carried out, and from the responsibility towards the lives of others. Faced with offering euthanasia, as the only solution to the suffering of people in the last stage of their life, quality palliative care should be proposed. These are the only ethical option, consistent with respect for human dignity.

Knowledge of the viral structure, factors that help in its progression and spread, pathological findings, diagnostic methods and, treatment modalities helps in understanding the viral disease and also in treating the patients in a better way besides preventing the community spread of this deadly infection. The causative agent is a single- stranded RNA virus. The clinical spectrum varies in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, who later become potential silent carriers, thus unknowingly spreading the virus. The virus constantly undergoes recombination, with reports of cross-species infections. Studies have indicated a strong immunological basis of COVID-19 infection. Not only does it weaken the immune system causing multi-organ involvement but also helps in its progression and spread to others.Multiple organs especially lungs, heart, kidney, gastrointestinal and hepatic system, brain and skin are affected varying in their severity. Similarly, persons with associated co-morbidities are likely to be affected more in terms of the number as well as in the severity. Real- time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction confirms the presence of COVID-19 infection. Serological diagnosis helps in diagnosing an ongoing outbreak or retrospective infection. Furthermore, it also identifies individuals who have been infected or have recovered from the disease especially the asymptomatic. This helps in the development of an effective vaccine indicating the status of herd immunity in the community. Different treatment modalities are being tried and under trial. This review article thus highlights the global epidemiological status, characteristic of the virus, symptomatology of the patients, role of diagnostic tests available, organs affected including their morphological changes and the latest line of treatment of COVID-19.","Bal, Amanjit; Agrawal, Ranjan; Vaideeswar, Pradeep; Arava, Sudheer; Jain, Amita",Indian journal of pathology & microbiology,353,1

Using county-day measures of physical distancing derived from cell phone location data, we demonstrate that the proportion of people who stayed at home after shelter-in-place policies went into effect in March and April 2020 in the United States was significantly lower in counties with a high concentration of science skeptics. These results are robust to controlling for other potential drivers of differential physical distancing, such as political partisanship, income, education and COVID severity.

In this study, the authors assessed whether patients with a history of AWR (1) are actually at higher risk for AWR; (2) receive different anesthetic management; and (3) are relatively resistant to the hypnotic actions of volatile anesthetics. METHODS Patients with a history of AWR and matched controls from three randomized clinical trials investigating prevention of AWR were compared for relative risk of AWR. Anesthetic management was compared with the use of the Hotelling's T statistic. A linear mixed model, including previously identified covariates, assessed the effects of a history of AWR on the relationship between end-tidal anesthetic concentration and bispectral index. RESULTS The incidence of AWR was 1.7% (4 of 241) in patients with a history of AWR and 0.3% (4 of 1,205) in control patients (relative risk = 5.0; 95% CI, 1.3-19.9). Anesthetic management did not differ between cohorts, but there was a significant effect of a history of AWR on the end-tidal anesthetic concentration versus bispectral index relationship. CONCLUSIONS Surgical patients with a history of AWR are five times more likely to experience AWR than similar patients without a history of AWR. Further consideration should be given to modifying perioperative care and postoperative evaluation of patients with a history of AWR.","Aranake, Amrita; Gradwohl, Stephen; Ben-Abdallah, Arbi; Lin, Nan; Shanks, Amy; Helsten, Daniel L; Glick, David B; Jacobsohn, Eric; Villafranca, Alex J; Evers, Alex S; Avidan, Michael S; Mashour, George A",Anesthesiology,353,1

Routes of transmission remain to be fully understood. METHODS This prospective study compared a 1500-bed adult and 600-bed pediatric setting of a tertiary-care university hospital located in central Paris. From 24 February until 10 April 2020, all symptomatic HCWs were screened for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on a nasopharyngeal swab. HCWs screened positive were questioned on their profession, symptoms, and occupational and nonoccupational exposures to SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS Among 1344 HCWs tested, 373 were positive (28%) and 336 (90%) corresponding questionnaires were completed. Three hospitalizations and no deaths were reported. Most HCWs (70%) had patient-facing occupational activities (22% in COVID-19 dedicated units). The total number of HCW cases peaked on 23 March, then decreased slowly, concomitantly with a continuous increase of compliance to preventive measures (including universal medical masking and personal protective equipment [PPE] for direct care to COVID-19 patients). Attack rates were of 3.2% and 2.3% in the adult and pediatric settings, respectively (P = .0022). In the adult setting, HCWs more frequently reported exposure to COVID-19 patients without PPE (25% vs 15%, P = .046). Report of contacts with children attending out-of-home care facilities dramatically decreased over the study period. CONCLUSIONS Universal masking, reinforcement of hand hygiene, and PPE with medical masks for patients' care allowed protection of HCWs and containment of the outbreak.

The purpose of this study was to analyze the surgical outcomes (safety and efficacy) of LLR versus open liver resection (OLR) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).We collected data on all patients who received liver resection for HCC between April 2015 and September 2016 in our institution, and retrospectively investigated the demographic and perioperative data, and also surgical outcomes.Laparoscopic liver resection was performed in 225 patients and OLR in 291. In patients who underwent minor hepatectomy, LLR associated with a shorter duration of operation time (200 vs 220 minutes; P < 0.001), less blood loss (100 vs 225 mL; P < 0.001), lower transfusion rate (3.0% vs 12.0%; P = 0.012), and shorter postoperative hospital stay (6 vs 7 days; P < 0.001) compared with OLR. Dietary recovery was relatively fast in the group of LLR, but there were no significant differences in hepatic inflow occlusion rate, complication rate, and transfusion volume. Patients who received major hepatectomy had a longer duration of operation (240 vs 230 minutes; P < 0.001), less blood loss (200 vs 400 mL; P < 0.001), lower transfusion rate (4.8% vs 16.5%; P = 0.002), lower hepatic inflow occlusion rate (68.3% vs 91.7%; P < 0.001), and shorter postoperative hospital stay (6 vs 8 days; P < 0.001).

We review the scientific evidence behind commercially available biologic prostheses in relation to the impact of tissue source, manufacturing processes and supplemental cross-linking on in vitro and in vivo (animal model and clinical) performance. Cross-linked meshes exhibit increased resistance to collagenase activity and degradation whilst still allowing tissue in-growth. Mesh durability may be the most important characteristic in determining optimal clinical outcomes, particularly in the context of the increased collagenase activity seen in contaminated or infected fields. Of all the biologic meshes currently available, HDMI cross-linked acellular porcine dermis has been associated with the best clinical outcomes in contaminated or infected fields.","Smart, N J; Bryan, N; Hunt, J A",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,353,15

Understanding of these costs is useful for cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) research into new treatment modalities and for clinical guideline development. METHODS A systematic search was conducted in Ovid MEDLINE & other non-indexed materials and Ovid Embase for articles published between 1995 and 2017. The National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database (NHS-EED) filter and the McMaster sensitive therapy filter were combined with a bespoke search strategy for stress urinary incontinence (SUI). We extracted unit cost estimates, assessed variability and methodology, and determined transferability. RESULTS We included 37 studies in this review. Four hundred and eighty-two cost estimates from 13 countries worldwide were extracted. Descriptive analysis shows that hospital stay in gynecology ranged between €82 and €1,292 per day. Costs of gynecological consultation range from €30 in France to €158 in Sweden. In the UK, costs are estimated at €228 per hour. Costs of a tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) device range from €431 in Finland to €994 in Canada. TVT surgery per minute costs €25 in France and €82 in Sweden.

We aimed to assess the impact of a large-scale COVID-19 telemedicine system on emergency department (ED) visits and all-cause and cardiovascular hospital admissions in Brazil. METHODS From March 18-May 18, 2020 we evaluated the database of a cooperative private health insurance, with 1.28 million clients. The COVID-19 telemedicine system consisted of: a) mobile app, which redirects to teleconsultations if indicated; b) telemonitoring system, with regular phone calls to suspected/confirmed COVID-19 cases to monitor progression; c) emergency ambulance system (EAS), with internet phone triage and counselling. ED visits and hospital admissions were recorded, with diagnoses assessed by the Diagnosis Related Groups method. COVID-19 diagnosis and deaths were identified from the patients' registries, and outcomes assessed until June 1st. RESULTS In 60 days, 24,354 patients accessed one of the telemedicine systems. The most frequently utilized was telemonitoring (16,717, 69%), followed by teleconsultation (13,357, 55%) and EAS (687, 3%). The rates of ED and hospital admissions were: telemonitoring 19.7% (3,296) and 4.7% (782); teleconsultation 17.3% (2,313) and 2.4% (318) and EAS: 55.9% (384) and 56.5% (388) patients. At total 4.1% (1,010) had hospital admissions, 36% (363) with respiratory diseases (44 requiring mechanical ventilation) and 4.4% (44) with cardiovascular diagnoses. Overall, 277 (1.1%) patients had confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, and 160 (0.7%) died, 9 with COVID-19. CONCLUSION Telemedicine resulted in low rates of ED visits and hospital admissions, suggesting positive impacts on healthcare utilization. Cardiovascular admissions were remarkably rare.","Nascimento, Bruno R; Brant, Luisa Cc; Castro, Ana Cristina T; Froes, Luiz Eduardo V; Ribeiro, Antonio Luiz P; Cruz, Larissa V; Araújo, Cynthia B; Souza, Charles F; Froes, Eduardo T; Souza, Soraya D",Journal of telemedicine and telecare,353,23

So far, belief updating has been investigated in partly unrelated lines of research from different psychological disciplines. In this article, we aim to integrate these disparate lines of research. After presenting some prominent theoretical frameworks and experimental designs that have been used for the study of belief updating, we review how healthy people and people with mental disorders update their beliefs after receiving new information that supports or challenges their views. Available evidence suggests that both healthy people and people with particular mental disorders are prone to certain biases when updating their beliefs, although the nature of the respective biases varies considerably and depends on several factors. Anomalies in belief updating are discussed in terms of both new insights into the psychopathology of various mental disorders and societal implications, such as irreconcilable political and societal controversies due to the failure to take information into account that disconfirms one's own view. We conclude by proposing a novel integrative model of belief updating and derive directions for future research.","Kube, Tobias; Rozenkrantz, Liron",Perspectives on psychological science : a journal of the Association for Psychological Science,353,26

We report our experience of the first use of SERI Surgical Scaffold (SERI; Allergan, Inc.) in 21 cases of direct to implant (DTI) breast reconstruction after SSM. METHODS Our retrospective experience, from April 2013 to May 2014, is based on 21 cases of direct to implant (DTI) breast reconstruction after SSM (9 monolateral 6 bilateral). All the patients were oncological with a preoperative cancer stage was into 0-2 stage. In order to assess the level of satisfaction with the aesthetical result, on 4-13 months post-operative patients were asked to complete a questionnaire that evaluated various parameters by means of a Visual Analogue Scale (V.A.S.). RESULTS Over a 13-months period, a total of 15 patients underwent 21 immediate breast reconstructive procedures with Allergan Natrelle 410 style implants plus SERI after SSMs. Definitive histological examination give evidence of 5 patients intraductal carcinoma, 6 patients multifocal carcinoma and 4 patients carcinoma in situ. 6 bilateral cases of direct to implant (DTI) breast reconstruction after SSM had a monolateral oncological treatment and on the other side a prophylactic treatment. At the end of the short follow up (minimum 6 months) all the patient were cancer free with an excellent outcome. Complication rate presents just one implant exposure followed by a revised surgery. At V.A.S. the mean patient satisfaction was 5,77 (good), 4,09 (fair) for sensitivity of the nipple areola complex, 6,33 (good) assessment of implant position, 6,28 (good) self esteem, 5,2 (good) attraction ability, 4,99 (fair) intimate life, 6,81 (good) overall feelings about breast reconstruction, 6,71 (good) simmetry. CONCLUSIONS The really encouraging results of our early experience will help surgeons introducing SERI into their practice to select appropriate patients for direct-to-implant single-stage immediate breast reconstruction.

Data collection mechanisms in PLS seem to be a significant determinant in avoiding mistakes. Using electronic devices such as smartphones and tablet computers improves the quality and cost-effectiveness of public health surveys. However, there is a lack of systematic evidence to show the potential impact of electronic data collection tools on data quality and cost reduction in interviewer-administered surveys compared with the standard paper-based data collection system. OBJECTIVE This systematic review aims to evaluate the impact of the interviewer-administered electronic data collection methods on data quality and cost reduction in PLS compared with traditional methods. METHODS We conducted a systematic search of MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, the Web of Science, EconLit, Cochrane CENTRAL, and CDSR to identify relevant studies from 2008 to 2018. We included randomized and nonrandomized studies that examined data quality and cost reduction outcomes, as well as usability, user experience, and usage parameters. In total, 2 independent authors screened the title and abstract, and extracted data from selected papers. A third author mediated any disagreements. The review authors used EndNote for deduplication and Rayyan for screening. RESULTS Our search produced 3817 papers. After deduplication, we screened 2533 papers, and 14 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. None of the studies were randomized controlled trials; most had a quasi-experimental design, for example, comparative experimental evaluation studies nested on other ongoing cross-sectional surveys. A total of 4 comparative evaluations, 2 pre-post intervention comparative evaluations, 2 retrospective comparative evaluations, and 4 one-arm noncomparative studies were included. Meta-analysis was not possible because of the heterogeneity in study designs, types, study settings, and level of outcome measurements. Individual paper synthesis showed that electronic data collection systems provided good quality data and delivered faster compared with paper-based data collection systems. Only 2 studies linked cost and data quality outcomes to describe the cost-effectiveness of electronic data collection systems. Field data collectors reported that an electronic data collection system was a feasible, acceptable, and preferable tool for their work. Onsite data error prevention, fast data submission, and easy-to-handle devices were the comparative advantages offered by electronic data collection systems. Challenges during implementation included technical difficulties, accidental data loss, device theft, security concerns, power surges, and internet connection problems. CONCLUSIONS Although evidence exists of the comparative advantages of electronic data collection compared with paper-based methods, the included studies were not methodologically rigorous enough to combine. More rigorous studies are needed to compare paper and electronic data collection systems in public health surveys considering data quality, work efficiency, and cost reduction.

However, there is limited evidence regarding its efficacy to reduce viral transmission risks. We aim to provide an evidence-based approach to optimize the use of slit lamp shields during clinical examination. RECENT FINDINGS Respiratory droplets from coughing and sneezing can travel up to 50 m/s and over a distance of 2 m, with a potential area of spread of 616 cm. Slit lamp shields confer added protection against large droplets but are limited against smaller particles. A larger shield curved toward the ophthalmologist and positioned closer to the patient increases protection against large droplets. A potential improvement to the design of such shields is the use of hydrophilic materials with antiviral properties which may help to minimize splashing of infectious droplets, reducing transmission risks. These include gold or silver nanoparticles and graphene oxide. SUMMARY Slit lamp shields serve as a barrier for large droplets, but its protection against smaller droplets is undetermined. It should be large, positioned close to the patient, and used in tandem with routine basic disinfection practices.","Ong, Sze C; Yap, Jun X; Tay, Terrence Y F; Mo, Yin; Loon, Seng C; Koh, Victor",Current opinion in ophthalmology,353,31

However, some donors may be considered unsuitable, and few modifications to the existing technique can tailor this procedure for an individual donor. Recently, further changes including clustering of ports and single-port methods have been investigated. METHODS The laparoscopic method was offered to all but 3 donors from May 1997 to October 2009. Data were collected on all 289 donors who underwent laparoscopic procedures. RESULTS All but 5 donor procedures were completed laparoscopically, and in 4 of them conversion to open was necessary due to hemorrhage. The fifth was a planned conversion in our first right LDN. Delayed graft function was seen in 7 recipients and 5 required dialysis postoperatively. Two kidneys were lost due to arterial thrombosis, and 5 patients underwent segmental infarction with decreased renal function. Mean hospital stay was 2.35±1.67 days. There were no donor deaths or serious morbidity.

The situation can potentially be exacerbated if healthcare providers do not have effective mechanisms in place for disaster response. The response to Hurricane Katrina, a Category 3 hurricane that made landfall in August 2005 and affected several states in the southwestern U.S., was a vivid example of how the lack of effective planning and responsiveness can affect healthcare services. In this paper, based on an extensive case study, which included a rigorous examination of the Veterans Health Administration's information technology (IT) infrastructure and its response to Hurricane Katrina, we present five strategies that healthcare organizations can undertake to develop and leverage IT-enabled disaster response. These include the development of: 1) an integrated IT architecture; 2) a universal data repository; 3) web-based disaster communication and coordination; 4) an IT-enabled disaster support system; and 5) standardized and integrated IT-enabled disaster response processes. We discuss how these strategies can help healthcare providers manage continuity and offer quality healthcare during natural disasters.","Bala, Hillol; Venkatesh, Viswanath; Venkatraman, Srinivasan; Bates, Jack",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,353,20

The inflammatory response elicited by the infection is partly directed against the placenta and fetus and is the putative pathogenic mechanism for fetal brain developmental abnormalities. Fetal brain abnormalities are generally irreversible after birth and increase risk for later mental disorders. Maternal immune activation in animals models this pathophysiology. SARS-CoV-2 produces maternal inflammatory responses during pregnancy similar to previously studied common respiratory viruses. METHOD Choline, folic acid, Vitamin D, and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are among the nutrients that have been studied as possible mitigating factors for effects of maternal infection and inflammation on fetal development. Clinical and animal studies relevant to their use in pregnant women who have been infected are reviewed. RESULTS Higher maternal choline levels have positive effects on the development of brain function for infants of mothers who experienced viral infections in early pregnancy. No other nutrient has been studied in the context of viral inflammation. Vitamin D reduces pro-inflammatory cytokines in some, but not all, studies. Active folic acid metabolites decrease anti-inflammatory cytokines. N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have no effect. CONCLUSIONS Vitamin D and folic acid are already supplemented in food additives and in prenatal vitamins. Despite recommendations by several public health agencies and medical societies, choline intake is often inadequate in early gestation when the brain is forming. A public health initiative for choline supplements during the pandemic could be helpful for women planning or already pregnant who also become exposed or infected with SARS-CoV-2.","Hoffman, M Camille; Freedman, Robert; Law, Amanda J; Clark, Alena M; Hunter, Sharon K",Clinical nutrition ESPEN,353,19

This case series describes clinical salmonellosis in four black rhinoceros calves. Two calves developed self-limiting diarrhea, recovering after treatment. The other two cases were fatal. One of the fatal cases had a short clinical course, whereas the other case was protracted, with signs reflecting multiple organ system involvement. In all cases, diagnosis was by fecal culture and/or quantitative polymerase chain reaction. A variable clinical presentation, which is typical for salmonellosis in domestic hoofstock, was a feature of these rhinoceros cases. Similarly, postmortem pathology in black rhinoceros calves was consistent with domestic neonatal ungulates with salmonellosis. Potential predisposing factors for infection were considered to be primiparity of the dam and failure of passive transfer in the calf. The case investigation included attempts to identify the source of infection, which was aided by organism serotyping. In one case, the patient's dam and another conspecific in the facility were shown to be asymptomatic shedders of the organism strain responsible for disease in the calf.

However, its clinical and electroencephalographic (EEG) sedative effects are not yet described in children. The aim of this prospective and randomized study was to assess clinical and EEG effects of increasing intravenous (IV) doses of GHB in burn children requiring sedation for burn wound cares. METHODS Thirty six children hospitalized in a burn care unit were included and randomly assigned into three groups (G) according to the single IV dose of GHB they received before burn wound care: 10 mg · kg(-1) in G10, 25 mg · kg(-1) in G25, or 50 mg · kg(-1) in G50. All patients received oral premedication (morphine and hydroxyzine) 30 min before GHB injection. Respiratory rate, heart rate, pulse oximetry, and bispectral index (BIS) were continuously monitored. Depth of sedation was clinically assessed using Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation (OAAS) Score, every 2 min until recovery (i.e., OAAS = 4). RESULTS Median age was 17.5 [12-34] months. Whatever the dose, BIS decreased after IV GHB. Nadir value of BIS was significantly lower in G25 and G50 than in G10, as was for OAAS score. Nadir values were reached after same delays in G25 and G50. Duration of sedation was dose-dependent. CONCLUSION Bispectral index decreased after GHB injection and was correlated with OAAS score. Deep sedation can be safely achieved with IV doses of 25 or 50 mg · kg(-1), but the last dose was associated with prolonged duration of clinical sedation.","Rousseau, Anne-Françoise; Ledoux, Didier; Sabourdin, Nada; Richard, Patrick; Damas, Pierre; Constant, Isabelle",Paediatric anaesthesia,353,14

Instant anastomotic tensile strength was assessed by burst pressure. Bio-impedance of fused tissue was measured by Impedance Analyzer across frequency that 100 Hz to 3 MHz. Statistical analysis shows only a weak correlation between bio-impedance modulus and burst pressures at frequency of 445 kHz ([Formula: see text] = -0.426, P = 0.099 > 0.05).

The decrease in mean reactance modulus with increasing burst pressures was highly significant (P = 0.019 < 0.05). The observed strong negative correlation between reactance modulus and burst pressures at frequency of 445 kHz indicates that reactance is likely to be a good index for tensile strength of RF-induced colorectal anastomosis, and should be considered for inclusion in a feedback loops in devices design.","Zhao, Lingxi; Zhou, Yu; Song, Chengli; Wang, Zhigang; Cuschieri, Alfred",Physiological measurement,353,1

In adults, capnography is the gold standard in respiratory monitoring. An alternative technique used in sleep laboratories is respiratory inductance plethysmography (RIP). However, it is not known if either monitor is well tolerated by pediatric patients for prolonged periods of time. AIM The goal of this study was to determine whether capnography or RIP is better tolerated in nonintubated, spontaneously breathing pediatric patients being treated with intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IVPCA). METHODS Nasal cannula capnography with oral sampling and thoracic and abdominal inductance plethysmography bands were placed along with the routine monitors on pediatric patients being treated for acute pain with IVPCA. Study monitors were left in place for as long as they were tolerated by the patient, up to a maximum of 24 consecutive hours. If the patient did not wear a particular study monitor for any reason, but tolerated the remaining monitor, participation in the study continued. If the patient would not wear either monitor, participation was terminated. RESULTS Twenty-six patients (18 female, eight male, average age 10.1 ± 5.5 years) consented to participate, but only 14 patients attempted to wear one or both the devices. Among those who wore either device, median time to device removal was 8.33 h (range 0.3-23.6 h) for capnography and 23.5 h (range 0.7-24 h) for RIP bands. CONCLUSION Children did not tolerate wearing capnography cannulae for prolonged periods of time, limiting the usefulness of this device as a continuous monitor of ventilation in children. RIP bands were better tolerated; however, they require further assessment of their utility. Until more effective, child-friendly monitors are developed and their utility is validated, guidelines recommended for adult patients cannot be extended to children.","Miller, Karen M; Kim, Andrew Y; Yaster, Myron; Kudchadkar, Sapna R; White, Elizabeth; Fackler, James; Monitto, Constance L",Paediatric anaesthesia,353,9

We aimed to independently validate the Hematoma Expansion Prediction (HEP) Score, an 18-point non-contrast prediction scale, in an external cohort and compare its diagnostic capability to the CTA spot sign. METHODS We performed a retrospective analysis of the predicting hematoma growth and outcome in intracerebral hemorrhage using contrast bolus CT (PREDICT) Cohort Study. Primary outcome was significant hematoma expansion (≥ 6 mL or ≥ 33%). We generated a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve comparing the HEP score to significant expansion. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV/NPV) for each score point. We determined independent predictors of significant hematoma expansion via logistic regression. RESULTS A total of 292 patients were included in primary analysis. Hematoma growth of ≥ 6 mL or ≥ 33% occurred in 94 patients (32%). The HEP score was associated with significant expansion (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.30). ROC curves comparing HEP score to significant expansion had an area under the curve of 0.64 (95% CI 0.57-0.71). Youden's method showed an optimum score of 4. HEP Scores ≥ 4 (n = 100, sensitivity 49%, specificity 73%, PPV 46%, NPV 75%, aOR 1.99, 95% CI 1.09-3.64) accurately predicted significant expansion. PPV increased with higher HEP scores, but at the cost of lower sensitivity. The diagnostic characteristics of the spot sign (n = 82, Sensitivity 49%, Specificity 81%, PPV 55%, NPV 76%, aOR 2.95, 95% CI 1.61-5.42) were similar to HEP scores ≥ 4. CONCLUSION The HEP score is predictive of significant expansion (≥ 6 mL or ≥ 33%) and is comparable to the spot sign in diagnostic accuracy. Non-contrast prediction tools may have a potential role in the recruitment of patients in future intracerebral hemorrhage trials.","Yogendrakumar, Vignan; Ramsay, Tim; Fergusson, Dean A; Demchuk, Andrew M; Aviv, Richard I; Rodriguez-Luna, David; Molina, Carlos A; Silva Blas, Yolanda; Dzialowski, Imanuel; Kobayashi, Adam; Boulanger, Jean-Martin; Lum, Cheemun; Gubitz, Gord; Srivastava, Padma; Roy, Jayanta; Kase, Carlos S; Bhatia, Rohit; Hill, Michael D; Selim, Magdy; Dowlatshahi, Dar",Neurocritical care,353,5

AIMS The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of endovascular treatment on clinical and radiological outcome in everyday clinical practice. METHODS We compared the rates of good outcome (modified Rankin scale ≤ 2 at discharge), in-hospital death, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhages, and infarct sizes in patients with distal intracranial carotid artery, M1 and M2 occlusions during two time periods. RESULTS From January 2008 to October 2012, a total of 509 patients were treated with intravenous thrombolysis and from November 2012 to December 2014, a total of 270 patients received endovascular treatment with stent retrievers (with or without intravenous thrombolysis). Significantly, more patients in the endovascular treatment group than in the intravenous thrombolysis group had a good outcome (37% vs. 27%, p < 0.01). The infarct sizes were significantly smaller after endovascular treatment than intravenous thrombolysis, whereas the symptomatic intracranial hemorrhages rates and in-hospital mortality were comparable between both treatment groups. The positive impact of endovascular treatment on clinical outcome was most pronounced in patients ≥75 years (31% endovascular treatment vs. 19% intravenous thrombolysis, p < 0.01), in patients with M1 occlusions (43% endovascular treatment vs. 25% intravenous thrombolysis, p < 0.01) and in patients with an admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale ≥ 14 (24% endovascular treatment vs. 11% intravenous thrombolysis, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION In everyday clinical practice and compared with intravenous thrombolysis, endovascular treatment significantly improved clinical outcome and was associated with smaller infarctions. This beneficial effect appeared to be highest in older patients, more severely affected patients, and in those with M1 occlusions.","Kastrup, Andreas; Brunner, Freimuth; Wasser, Katrin; Hildebrandt, Helmut; Roth, Christoph; Winterhalter, Michael; Papanagiotou, Panagiotis",International journal of stroke : official journal of the International Stroke Society,353,20

The consequence is poor health outcomes and premature death. Ample previous literature documents health inequities in the morbidity and mortality statistics for Black and Brown people in the United States. Their excess deaths are due to disproportionately high rates of serious health conditions (diabetes; hypertension; asthma; and lung, kidney, and heart disease), as well as structural factors having to do with income, employment, and the built environment in which they live. The health conditions are exacerbated with ongoing societal problems and stress emerging from the country's history of dehumanizing racial inequities. Current discrimination comes most virulently in the form of systematic and institutionalized racist policies that keep racial and ethnic minorities marginalized and disempowered. Furthermore, people of color encounter the immediate external pressures of working away from home and using public transportation during the country's extraordinary ongoing lockdown, heightening the risk of exposure to the virus. Moreover, the same population is overrepresented in jails and prisons where social distancing is impossible. Any virulent virus without a vaccine is bound to become a human petri dish in which people of color in the U.S. today are caught. The war against the coronavirus for people of color is part and parcel of the war to eliminate historic inequities and to level the socioeconomic playing field. This article covers the racial/ethnic inequities in morbidity and mortality from COVID19 and the slow and untimely response by the federal government to address mediation of the spread of the virus. For people of color to transcend the coronavirus pandemic crisis there must be comprehensive access to COVID-19 testing and early, sustained, and affordable access to health care, including hospitalization. Such access will require national leadership, which seems to be in short supply.","Braithwaite, Ronald; Warren, Rueben",Journal of health care for the poor and underserved,353,32

This article provides guidance for hospital managers, healthcare staff, district-level managers and provincial managers on parental access to hospitalised children during a pandemic such as COVID-19. It: (i) summarises legal and ethical issues around parental visitation rights; (ii) highlights four guiding principles; (iii) provides 10 practical recommendations to facilitate safe parental access to hospitalised children; (iv) highlights additional considerations if the mother is COVID-19-positive; and (v) provides considerations for fathers. In summary, it is a child's right to have access to his or her parents during hospitalisation, and parents should have access to their hospitalised children; during an infectious disease pandemic such as COVID-19, there is a responsibility to ensure that parental visitation is implemented in a reasonable and safe manner. Separation should only occur in exceptional circumstances, e.g. if adequate in-hospital facilities do not exist to jointly accommodate the parent/caregiver and the newborn/infant/child. Both parents should be allowed access to hospitalised children, under strict infection prevention and control (IPC) measures and with implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), including handwashing/sanitisation, face masks and physical distancing. Newborns/infants and their parents/caregivers have a reasonably high likelihood of having similar COVID-19 status, and should be managed as a dyad rather than as individuals. Every hospital should provide lodger/boarder facilities for mothers who are COVID-19-positive, COVID-19-negative or persons under investigation (PUI), separately, with stringent IPC measures and NPIs. If facilities are limited, breastfeeding mothers should be prioritised, in the following order: (i) COVID-19-negative; (ii) COVID-19 PUI; and (iii) COVID-19-positive. Breastfeeding, or breastmilk feeding, should be promoted, supported and protected, and skin-to-skin care of newborns with the mother/caregiver (with IPC measures) should be discussed and practised as far as possible. Surgical masks should be provided to all parents/caregivers and replaced daily throughout the hospital stay. Parents should be referred to social services and local community resources to ensure that multidisciplinary support is provided. Hospitals should develop individual-level policies and share these with staff and parents. Additionally, hospitals should ideally track the effect of parental visitation rights on hospital-based COVID-19 outbreaks, the mental health of hospitalised children, and their rate of recovery.","Goga, A; Feucht, U; Pillay, S; Reubenson, G; Jeena, P; Mahdi, S; Mayet, N T; Velaphi, S; McKerrow, N; Mathivha, L R; Makubalo, N; Green, R J; Gray, G",South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,353,28

We used a porcine model to evaluate the safety of endoscopy after esophagectomy. METHODS We performed esophagectomies in 10 live pigs and performed endoscopy with progressive air insufflation and continuous intraluminal pressure monitoring. We stopped insufflation when the intraluminal pressure reached a plateau. We assessed the integrity of the conduit and anastomosis via endoscopy. We also performed pulse oximetry of the stomach and Doppler velocimetry of the right gastroepiploic artery on 5 live pigs to study the effects of endoscopic gastric insufflation. RESULTS With gentle air insufflation, there was no measurable increase in intraluminal pressure, disruption of the conduit or anastomosis, or significant gastric distension. With progressive insufflation, the intraluminal pressure reached a plateau at a maximum of 8.7 ± 2.1 cm H2O (95% confidence interval, 7.2-10.2). At this plateau, air leaked retrograde via the mouth, which prevented further gastric distension. There were no significant changes in oxyhemoglobin saturation along various regions in the stomach even with maximal insufflation sustained for 10 minutes. There was a momentary reduction in gastroepiploic flow from 12.0 ± 1.0 [95% confidence interval, 10.8-13.2] mL/min/100 g to 9.6 ± 1.5 [95% confidence interval, 7.8-11.4] mL/min/100 g immediately after maximal insufflation, but flow recovered to 11 ± 1.3 [9.6, 12.8] mL/min/100 g after 10 minutes of sustained insufflation. CONCLUSIONS Endoscopy after esophagectomy with gentle or maximal air insufflation results in safe endoluminal pressures and minimal disturbance of blood flow and oxygenation.","Raman, Vignesh; Moodie, Karen L; Ofoche, Obinna O; Kaiser, Larry R; Erkmen, Cherie P",The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,353,1

Although already applied in some gynaecological surgical interventions, this video is to our knowledge the first publication on the use of the mini-laparoscopic approach to sacrocolpopexy for apical and posterior pelvic organ prolapse following total hysterectomy. METHODS The concept of mini-laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy presented in this video article was performed on 12 women with post-hysterectomy apical and posterior pelvic organ prolapse using mini-laparoscopic instruments and ports of 3 mm in diameter combined with a 12-mm umbilical port. Surgery was performed with the same principles as for the conventional laparoscopic procedure. RESULTS The mean operating time was 70 min (SD ± 12). The tensile strength of the mini-laparoscopic instruments allowed appropriate manipulation of tissue consistent with that of conventional instruments. No difficulties or complications were experienced in comparison to a conventional technique. All patients were discharged from hospital on day 1 postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS The effectiveness, safety and feasibility of the mini-laparoscopic surgical technique was applied to sacrocolpopexy.

Healthcare workers are struggling to provide the best care for COVID-19 patients. Approaches for invasive ventilation vary widely between and within countries and new insights are acquired rapidly. We aim to investigate invasive ventilation practices and outcome in COVID-19 patients in the Netherlands. Methods PRoVENT-COVID ('study of PRactice of VENTilation in COVID-19') is an investigator-initiated national, multicenter observational study to be undertaken in intensive care units (ICUs) in The Netherlands. Consecutive COVID-19 patients aged 18 years or older, who are receiving invasive ventilation in the participating ICUs, are to be enrolled during a 10-week period, with a daily follow-up of 7 days. The primary outcome is ventilatory management (including tidal volume expressed as mL/kg predicted body weight and positive end-expiratory pressure expressed as cmH2O) during the first 3 days of ventilation. Secondary outcomes include other ventilatory variables, use of rescue therapies for refractory hypoxemia such as prone positioning and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, use of sedatives, vasopressors and inotropes; daily cumulative fluid balances; acute kidney injury; ventilator-free days and alive at day 28 (VFD-28), duration of ICU and hospital stay, and ICU, hospital and 90-day mortality. Discussion PRoVENT-COVID will be the largest observational study to date, with high density ventilatory data and major outcomes. There is urgent need for a better understanding of ventilation practices, and the effects of ventilator settings on outcomes in COVID-19 patients. The results of PRoVENT-COVID will be rapidly disseminated through electronic presentations, such as webinars and electronic conferences, and publications in international peer-reviewed journals.

We divided CXR in to six zones (right upper, mid & lower and left, upper mid & lower zones). We scored each zone as- 0, 1 or 2 as follows- if that zone was clear (0) Ground glass opacity (1) or Consolidation (2). A total of score from 0 to 12 could be obtained. RESULTS A CXR score cut off ≥3 independently predicted mortality. Along with a relatively higher NPV ≥80%, it reinforced the importance of CXR score is a screening tool to triage patients according to risk of mortality.

AREAS COVERED The area of chronic neutropenia remains fragmented between diverse diseases or situations. Here physicians involved in different aspects of chronic neutropenia gather both the data from medical literature till the end of May 2021 and their experience to offer a global approach for the diagnosis of chronic neutropenia as well as their medical care. EXPERT OPINION In most cases, the neutropenia is transient, frequently related to a viral infection, and not harmful. However, neutropenia can be chronic (i.e., >3 months) and related to a number of etiologies, some clinically benign, such as so-called ""ethnic"" neutropenia. Autoimmune neutropenia is the common form in young children, whereas idiopathic/immune neutropenia is a frequent etiology in young females. Inherited neutropenia (or congenital neutropenia) is exceptional, with approximately 30 new cases per 106 births and 30 known subtypes. Such patients have a high risk of invasive bacterial infections, and oral infections. Supportive therapy, which is primarily based on daily administration of an antibiotic prophylaxis and/or treatment with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), contributes to avoiding recurrent infections.","Donadieu, Jean; Frenz, Stephanie; Merz, Lauren; Sicre de Fontbrune, Flore; Rotulo, Gioacchino Andrea; Beaupain, Blandine; Biosse-Duplan, Martin; Audrain, Marie; Croisille, Laure; Ancliff, Phil; Klein, Christoph; Bellanné-Chantelot, Christine",Expert review of hematology,353,1

METHODS The databases MEDLINE, Embase and PsycInfo were searched (May 2017) for papers reporting on time since spousal loss in widowed people and the prevalence of common mental disorders. A systematic review was conducted according to MOOSE guidelines. Random effects meta-analyses of the prevalence of depression were conducted by intervals of time since spousal loss. RESULTS The literature search identified 12,982 studies of which 22 were eligible for inclusion in the systematic review. Of these, 14 were furthermore eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis. The summary estimates found in the meta-analysis for the prevalence of depression in the intervals of time since spousal loss were: ≤ 1 month: 38.2% (21.9-55.8%); > 1 month to 3 months: 25.0% (17.3-33.5%); > 3 months to 6 months: 23.1% (18.0-28.7%); > 6 months to 12 months: 19.4% (15.2-24.0%); > 12 months to 18 months: 11.1% (5.3-18.7%); > 18 months to 24 months: 15.2% (12.3-18.2%); > 24 months to 60 months: 10.5% (4.3-18.5%). CONCLUSION Widowhood is associated with a high prevalence of depression and the study identifies a population group needing special attention in daily clinical practice. The prevalence is highest in the first month of widowhood, however, continues to be high at least 5 years into widowhood.","Kristiansen, Christina Blanner; Kjær, Jesper Nørgaard; Hjorth, Peter; Andersen, Kjeld; Prina, A Matthew",Social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology,353,1

We performed minimally invasive surgery, hybrid natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) without scarring, for a huge liver cyst. PRESENTATION OF CASE An 82-year-old female presented with a month-long history of right upper abdominal pain. We diagnosed her condition as a huge liver cyst by morphological studies. She denied any history of abdominal trauma. Her serum CEA and CA19-9 were normal and a serum echinococcus serologic test was negative. Laparoscopic fenestration, using a hybrid NOTES procedure via a transvaginal approach, was performed for a huge liver cyst because we anticipated difficulty with an umbilical approach, such as single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS). Her post-operative course was uneventful and she was discharged from our hospital three days after surgery. Pain killers were not required during and after hospitalization. No recurrence of the liver cyst or bulging was detected by clinical examination two years later. DISCUSSION A recent trend of laparoscopic procedure has been towards minimizing the number of incisions to achieve less invasiveness. This hybrid NOTES, with a small incision for abdominal access, along with vaginal access, enabled painless operation for a huge liver cyst. CONCLUSION We report a huge liver cyst treated by hybrid NOTES. This approach is safe, less invasive, and may be the first choice for a huge liver cyst.","Kashiwagi, Hiroyuki; Kawachi, Jun; Isogai, Naoko; Ishii, Masanori; Miyake, Katsunori; Shimoyama, Rai; Fukai, Ryota; Ogino, Hidemitsu",International journal of surgery case reports,353,8

Radiofrequency energy can transfer to nearby instruments via antenna and capacitive coupling without direct contact. Previous studies have described inadvertent energy transfer through bundled cords and nonelectrically active wires. The purpose of this study was to describe a new mechanism of stray energy transfer from the monopolar instrument through the operating surgeon to the laparoscopic telescope and propose practical measures to decrease the risk of injury. METHODS Radiofrequency energy was delivered to a laparoscopic L-hook (monopolar ""bovie""), an advanced bipolar device, and an ultrasonic device in a laparoscopic simulator. The tip of a 10-mm telescope was placed adjacent but not touching bovine liver in a standard four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy setup. Temperature increase was measured as tissue temperature from baseline nearest the tip of the telescope which was never in contact with the energy-based device after a 5-s open-air activation. RESULTS The monopolar L-hook increased tissue temperature adjacent to the camera/telescope tip by 47 ± 8°C from baseline (P < 0.001). By having an assistant surgeon hold the camera/telescope (rather than one surgeon holding both the active electrode and the camera/telescope), temperature change was reduced to 26 ± 7°C (P < 0.001). Alternative energy devices significantly reduced temperature change in comparison to the monopolar instrument (47 ± 8°C) for both the advanced bipolar (1.2 ± 0.5°C; P < 0.001) and ultrasonic (0.6 ± 0.3°C; P < 0.001) devices. CONCLUSIONS Stray energy transfers from the monopolar ""bovie"" instrument through the operating surgeon to standard electrically inactive laparoscopic instruments. Hand-to-hand coupling describes a new form of capacitive coupling where the surgeon's body acts as an electrical conductor to transmit energy. Strategies to reduce stray energy transfer include avoiding the same surgeon holding the active electrode and laparoscopic camera or using alternative energy devices.","Overbey, Douglas M; Hilton, Sarah A; Chapman, Brandon C; Townsend, Nicole T; Barnett, Carlton C; Robinson, Thomas N; Jones, Edward L",The Journal of surgical research,353,1

We are now seeing an increasing number of patients with advanced-stage diagnosis and mortality from colorectal cancer before 50 years of age, which requires earlier screening. With the increasing need for CRC screening through colonoscopy, and thus endoscopists, easier and simpler techniques are needed to train proficient endoscopists. The most widely used approach by endoscopists is air insufflation colonoscopy, where air distends the colon to allow visualization of the colonic mucosa. This technique is un-comfortable for patients and requires an anesthetist to administer sedation. In addition, patients commonly complain about discomfort post-op as air escapes into the small bowel and cannot be adequately removed. Current research into the use of water insufflation colonoscopies has proved promising in reducing the need for sedation, decreasing discomfort, and increasing the visibility of the colonic mucosa. Future direction into water insufflation colonoscopies which have shown to be simpler and easier to teach may increase the number of proficient endoscopists in training to serve our aging population.","Hayman, Chelsea V; Vyas, Dinesh",World journal of gastroenterology,353,16

This study analyzed the functional results in patients with low rectal cancer. METHODS Ten consecutive patients (nine males) undergoing electrophysiologically controlled nerve-sparing taTME were investigated prospectively and asked to complete functional questionnaires [the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), International Index of Erectile Function, Female Sexual Function Index, Wexner score, and low anterior resection syndrome (LARS) score]. Bladder function was also assessed according to residual urine volume. Preoperative function was compared to the functional outcome 3 and 6 months, and 9 months if eligible, after stoma closure or surgery in the absence of a diverting stoma. RESULTS Prior to therapy, urinary and sexual function was impaired in 40 and 60% of patients, respectively. None of the patients developed pathological residual urine volumes after at least unilateral functional pelvic nerve-sparing. Median IPSS was lower than preoperative scores (p > 0.05). Two males with incomplete nerve preservation were considered impotent during a median follow-up of 15 months (range 6-20 months). The female was judged to be sexually inactive. The median Wexner score was 1 (range 0-7) prior to any therapy and increased to 7 (range 0-15) at 6 months (p = 0.029), with 40% of patients categorized as having no LARS and 50% minor LARS. The median LARS score was 28 (range 9-38) at 3 months and 26 (range 9-32) at 6 months (p = 0.165). CONCLUSIONS Despite a small sample size and confounding factors, data indicate that taTME has the potential to preserve continence, sufficient bowel function, and urogenital function.","Kneist, W; Wachter, N; Paschold, M; Kauff, D W; Rink, A D; Lang, H",Techniques in coloproctology,353,16

Herein, we developed a kind of pH-responsive and degradable hyperbranched polymeric nanocarriers via yne-phenol click-reaction of resveratrol (RSV) with bifunctional n-butyl dipropiolate (BDP) for efficient doxorubicin (DOX) delivery. The natural product RSV with three phenol groups has excellent antioxidant activity and synergetic enhancement for some anticancer drugs such as DOX. RSV tends to attack the alkynyl groups on BDP by nucleophilic addition in the presence of base as catalyst to afford hyperbranched polyprodrug (denoted as RB). PEGylated RB (termed as RBP) were further synthesized to improve the water solubility and prolong blood circulation by the click reaction of propiolate-terminated RB with amino terminated poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG-NH2). Interestingly, the RBP have high DOX loading ratio (∼58.6 %) at neutral pH, but the vinyl-ether bonds in RB could break down at low pH conditions such as acidic TME (extracellular pH∼6.8, endosomes and lysosomes pH∼5.0) that leading to the targeting release of DOX and RSV. Therefore, the developed RBP@DOX nanoparticles exhibited high kill efficiency to tumor cells and slight damage to normal cells due to the effective delivery and release of DOX and RSV in tumor sites and the synergistic enhancement effect of two drugs.","Zhang, Ning; Wang, Daquan; Yang, Tingting; Jing, Xunan; Meng, Lingjie","Colloids and surfaces.

We used conventional, 2-dimensional (2D) phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging (PC-MRI) to assess the relationship between altered flow and future growth in patients with BAV. MATERIALS AND METHODS Aortic MRI data were reviewed for 17 adult patients with BAV with right-left leaflet fusion undergoing surveillance imaging who had 2D PC-MRI through their ascending aortas on an initial study, follow-up studies more than 1 year later, and an initial maximum aortic diameter of less than 4.5 cm. Diameters were measured at standard levels by 2 blinded reviewers. Normalized systolic flow displacement was calculated at peak systole from the PC-MRI data, and correlation with the interval aortic growth was performed, with adjustment for clinical/demographic factors. RESULTS The average follow-up interval was 2.9 ± 1.3 years. Systolic flow displacement at the initial study strongly correlated with ascending aortic growth rate (r = 0.71, P < 0.005) with moderate, non-significant correlation between initial diameter and growth (r = 0.45, P = 0.214). Aortic growth was 4 times faster in patients with initial flow displacement of 0.2 or greater (n = 9) compared with those (n = 8) with initial flow displacement less than 0.2 (0.8 ± 0.4 vs 0.2 ± 0.3 mm/y; P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS Systolic flow displacement calculated from conventional 2D PC-MRI in the ascending aorta correlates with future aortic growth in patients undergoing routine surveillance imaging for BAV. With a cutoff valve of 0.2, flow displacement may be used to identify a subset of patients likely to have elevated growth rates and may better risk-stratify patients with BAV for aortic disease progression than vessel diameter alone.","Burris, Nicholas S; Sigovan, Monica; Knauer, Heather A; Tseng, Elaine E; Saloner, David; Hope, Michael D",Investigative radiology,353,16

To maximize efficacy, checkpoint inhibitors are often combined with cytotoxic agents. While this approach often leads to increased tumor regression, higher off target toxicity often results in certain patients. This report describes a novel formulation comprising a unique amphiphilic molecule, 8-((2-hydroxybenzoyl)amino)octanoate (SHAO), that non-covalently interacts with payloads to increase drug dispersion and diffusion when dosed intratumorally (IT) into solid tumors. SHAO is co-formulated with cisplatin and vinblastine (referred to as INT230-6). IT dosing of the novel formulation achieved greater tumor growth inhibition and improved survival in in vivo tumor models compared to the same drugs without enhancer given intravenously or IT. INT230-6 treatment increased immune infiltrating cells in injected tumors with 10% to 20% of the animals having complete responses and developing systemic immunity to the cancer. INT230-6 was also shown to be synergistic with programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibodies at improving survival and increasing complete responses. INT230-6 induced significant tumor necrosis potentially releasing antigens to induce the systemic immune-based anti-cancer attack. This research demonstrates a novel, local treatment approach for cancer that minimizes systemic toxicity while stimulating adaptive immunity.","Bender, Lewis H; Abbate, Franco; Walters, Ian B",International journal of molecular sciences,353,7

We sought to evaluate the association of post-endovascular thrombectomy systolic blood pressure (SBP) levels with clinical outcomes. Methods- We included endovascular thrombectomy-treated patients registered from 2014 to 2017 in the Safe Implementation of Treatments in Stroke International Thrombectomy Registry. The mean 24-hour SBP after endovascular thrombectomy treatment was analyzed both as a continuous variable and in intervals. The primary outcome was 3-month functional independence (modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2). The secondary outcomes were symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (SICH) and 3-month mortality. The SBP interval with the highest proportion of functional independence was chosen as reference. All analyses were performed for successful or unsuccessful recanalization (modified Treatment in Cerebral Ischemia score ≥2b or <2b, respectively). The results were adjusted for known confounders in logistic regression models. Results- In the multivariable analyses, a higher SBP value as a continuous variable was associated unfavorably with all outcomes in patients with successful recanalization (n=2920) and with more SICH in patients with unsuccessful recanalization (n=711). SBP interval ≥160 mm Hg was associated with less functional independence (adjusted odds ratio, 0.28 [95% CIs, 0.15-0.53]) and more SICH (adjusted odds ratio, 6.82 [95% CIs, 1.53-38.09]) compared with reference 100 to 119 mm Hg in patients with successful recanalization. SBP ≥160 mm Hg was associated with more SICH (adjusted odds ratio, 6.62 [95% CIs, 1.07-51.05]) compared with reference 120 to 139 mm Hg in patients with unsuccessful recanalization. Conclusions- Higher SBP values were associated with less functional independence at 3 months in patients with successful recanalization and with more SICH regardless of recanalization status.","Matusevicius, Marius; Cooray, Charith; Bottai, Matteo; Mazya, Michael; Tsivgoulis, Georgios; Nunes, Ana Paiva; Moreira, Tiago; Ollikainen, Jyrki; Tassi, Rosanna; Strbian, Daniel; Toni, Danilo; Holmin, Staffan; Ahmed, Niaz",Stroke,353,16

RNA editing by host deaminases is an innate restriction process to counter virus infection, but it is not yet known whether this process operates against coronaviruses. Here, we analyze RNA sequences from bronchoalveolar lavage fluids obtained from coronavirus-infected patients. We identify nucleotide changes that may be signatures of RNA editing: adenosine-to-inosine changes from ADAR deaminases and cytosine-to-uracil changes from APOBEC deaminases. Mutational analysis of genomes from different strains of Coronaviridae from human hosts reveals mutational patterns consistent with those observed in the transcriptomic data. However, the reduced ADAR signature in these data raises the possibility that ADARs might be more effective than APOBECs in restricting viral propagation. Our results thus suggest that both APOBECs and ADARs are involved in coronavirus genome editing, a process that may shape the fate of both virus and patient.","Di Giorgio, Salvatore; Martignano, Filippo; Torcia, Maria Gabriella; Mattiuz, Giorgio; Conticello, Silvestro G",Science advances,353,17

METHODS A total of 175 patients scheduled for unilateral inguinal hernia repair were assigned to one of the following groups: (i) open repair under local anesthesia, (ii) open repair under regional anesthesia, (iii) open repair under general anesthesia, and (iv) TAPP under regional anesthesia. Immediate postoperative pain was the main outcome measured. Short- and long-term complications and the degree of patient satisfaction were also assessed. RESULTS Transabdominal preperitoneal repair under regional anesthesia yielded the lowest pain scores, whereas open repair under general anesthesia yielded the highest pain scores (P < 0.05). Open repair under local or general anesthesia had a lower urinary retention incidence than the spinal groups (P < 0.05). Chronic pain incidence was lower for the TAPP group (P 0.003). There were no differences in other short- and long-term complications. CONCLUSION Transabdominal preperitoneal repair under spinal anesthesia proved superior to open repair performed under different types of anesthesia in terms of immediate (24-h) postoperative pain. The method of anesthesia might have contributed more to this favorable outcome than the surgical technique itself, but at the cost of a high urinary retention incidence. The incidence of chronic pain was lower after TAPP repair.","Symeonidis, Dimitrios; Baloyiannis, Ioannis; Koukoulis, George; Pratsas, Konstantinos; Georgopoulou, Stavroula; Efthymiou, Mattheos; Tzovaras, George",Surgery today,353,1

Infarct volume and neurobehavioral outcomes were examined. The number of differentiated NSCs was compared in aged and young-adult ischemic rats and angiogenesis and neurogenesis were also determined. We found that aged rats developed larger infarcts than young-adult rats after ischemia (P<0.05). The neurobehavioral outcome was also worse for aged rats comparing with young-adult rats. Brain infarction and neurologic deficits were attenuated after NSC transplantation in both aged and young-adult rats. The number of survived NSCs in aged rats was similar to that of the young-adult rats (P>0.05) and most of them were differentiated into glial fibrillary acidic protein(+) (GFAP(+)) cells.

RECENT FINDINGS Although a majority of pregnant women infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remain asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic, pregnancy puts women at higher risk of severe COVID-19 and adverse birth outcomes. Pregnant and recently pregnant women are more likely to be admitted to intensive care units and receive mechanical ventilation than nonpregnant patients with COVID-19, although preexisting maternal comorbidities are significant risk factors.Early provision of neuraxial labor analgesia with a functional indwelling epidural catheter has been universally promoted, with the goal to reduce avoidable general anesthesia for cesarean delivery and mitigate risks for healthcare workers during airway manipulation. This recommendation, along with updated workflow models of anesthesia coverage, may contribute to a reduction in general anesthesia rates. SUMMARY Initial recommendations to provide early neuraxial labor analgesia and avoid general anesthesia for cesarean delivery have not changed over time.

These guidelines, however, are largely based on retrospective literature and expert opinion. The appropriate level of postoperative monitoring remains controversial. Our objective was to prospectively document the early postoperative course of patients undergoing OSA surgery. STUDY DESIGN Prospective cohort study. METHODS One hundred twenty-one patients (age 43.9 + or - 13.5 years, 79.8% male) with sleep-study proven OSA (apnea-hypopnea index 31.9 + or - 22.7) who were undergoing surgery for OSA at our tertiary care center were recruited from 2007 to 2009. Outcome measures were: 1) incidence of respiratory complications requiring nursing intervention, 2) level of postoperative blood oxygen saturation divided into three groups: mean oxygen saturation in recovery room (SpO2(recovery)), mean oxygen saturation in step-up unit (SpO2(step-up)), and lowest oxygen saturation over the 24 hour period (SpO2(minimum)). These results were then compared to the benchmark literature. RESULTS The overall incidence of nursing intervention in response to a respiratory complication (3.4%) was significantly less than expected (P < .002). Mean SpO2(recovery) was 92.9 + or - 3.2%, SpO2(step-up) was 95.9 + or - 1.6%, and SpO2(minimum) was 92.8 + or - 3.1%. No variables were identified as being predictive of any of the outcome measures. CONCLUSIONS The incidence of respiratory events requiring intervention in the early postoperative course of OSA patients was low (3.4%).

Extensive hygiene measures have been established to prevent infection transmission in hospitals. Here, we developed a predictive score system (the predictive vancomycin-resistant enterococci [PREVENT] score) to identify the clearance or persistence in patients with a history of VRE carrier status at readmission. Over a cumulative 3-year period, patients with a positive VRE carrier status were included. The study population was recruited in two successive time periods and separated into training data for predictive score development and validation data for evaluation of the predictive power. The risk factors for persistent VRE colonization were analyzed in a univariable analysis before development of a logistic regression model based on the potential risk factors. The score points were determined proportionally to the beta coefficients of the logistic regression model. The data from 448 (79%) patients were used as the training data, and those from 119 (21%) as the validation data. Multivariable analysis revealed the following variables as independent risk factors: age of ≥60 years, hemato-oncological disease, cumulative antibiotic treatment for >4 weeks, and a VRE infection. The resulting logistic regression model exhibited an acceptable area under the curve (AUC) of 0.81 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72 to 0.91). The predictive score system had a sensitivity of 82% (95% CI, 65 to 93%) and a specificity of 77% (95% CI, 66 to 85%). The developed predictive score system is a useful tool to assess the VRE carrier status of patients with a history of VRE colonization. On the basis of this risk assessment, more focused and cost-effective infection control measures can be implemented. IMPORTANCE Given the increasing relevance of VRE as nosocomial pathogens worldwide, infection prevention and control measures, including patient isolation and contact precautions, are indispensable to avoid their spread in the hospital setting. In this study, we developed and validated the PREVENT score, a tool for rapid risk assessment of VRE persistence in patients with a history of previous VRE colonization. The score is designed to be easily performed, employing clinical information available in a regular admission setting and immediately providing information to inform the decision of whether to adopt patient isolation and contact precautions during the hospital stay. After validation, the score was shown to accurately identify patients with persistent VRE colonization upon admission, representing a suitable option as (i) a complementary method yielding preliminary results significantly more quickly than culture-based VRE detection techniques and (ii) an alternative strategy for VRE detection in settings in which microbiological VRE screening is not routinely performed due to limited resources.","Boeing, Christian; Correa-Martinez, Carlos L; Schuler, Franziska; Mellmann, Alexander; Karch, André; Kampmeier, Stefanie",Microbiology spectrum,353,16

AIM To evaluate the efficacy and safety of RFA for the treatment of CRP. METHODS Searches of PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases were performed from 2004 through March 2018. Review and data abstraction were performed independently by two authors. Measured outcomes included hemoglobin, transfusion dependence, number of treatment sessions, RFA settings, and serious adverse events. RESULTS Six studies (n=71; mean age 73.41±1.88 years; 90.14% males) were included. Thirty-eight percent of patients failed prior treatment with APC. Patients underwent a mean of 1.71±0.34 RFA sessions with 24.54±16.47 RFA applications per session. Pooled clinical and endoscopic success of RFA was 99% (95% CI: 90-100;p<0.001) and 100% (95% CI: 94-100;p<0.001), respectively. Serious adverse events were reported in one patient - pooled rate of 0% (95% CI: 0-3;p<0.001). Mean pre-procedure hemoglobin was 10.38±1.82 gm/dL with significant improvement observed post-RFA (weighted mean difference 2.49 gm/dL (95% CI: 2.16-2.82;p<0.001). Among transfusion dependent patients, 85% (95% CI: 68-97;p<0.001) became transfusion free post-RFA. Pooled mean follow-up was 19.73±9.72 months. CONCLUSION Despite limited long-term data on RFA for CRP, available evidence suggests RFA is an effective and safe treatment.","McCarty, Thomas R; Garg, Rajat; Rustagi, Tarun",Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,353,14

Psychiatric health care structures were severely limited with significant heterogeneity concerning extent and duration between the different Federal states. In four Federal states, psychiatric hospitals were exempted from providing capacities towards intensive care. Three Federal states loosened visiting limitations for psychiatric patients. CONCLUSION During the first lockdown, a broad range of regulations concerning the health care system was adopted often without specifically addressing psychiatric disorders.

However, its efficacy has not been compared with that of chemotherapy in a phase III trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS PEARL is a multicentre, phase III randomised study in which patients with aromatase inhibitors (AIs)-resistant MBC were included in two consecutive cohorts. In cohort 1 (C1), patients were randomised 1:1 to palbociclib plus exemestane or capecitabine. On discovering new evidence about oestrogen receptor-1 (ESR1) mutations inducing resistance to AIs, the trial was amended to include cohort 2 (C2), in which patients were randomised 1:1 between palbociclib plus fulvestrant and capecitabine. The stratification criteria were disease site, prior sensitivity to ET, prior chemotherapy for MBC, and country of origin. Co-primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) in C2 and in wild-type ESR1 patients (C1+C2). ESR1 hotspot mutations were analysed in baseline circulating tumour DNA. RESULTS From March-2014 to July-2018, 296 and 305 patients were included in C1 and C2, respectively. Palbociclib plus ET was not superior to capecitabine in both C2 (median PFS: 7.5 vs. 10.0 months; adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 1.13; 95% confidence Interval [CI]: 0.85-1.50) and wild-type ESR1 patients (median PFS: 8.0 vs. 10.6 months; aHR: 1.11; 95% CI: 0.87-1.41). The most frequent grade 3-4 toxicities with palbociclib plus exemestane, palbociclib plus fulvestrant, and capecitabine were neutropenia (57.4%, 55.7% and 5.5%), hand/foot syndrome (0%, 0% and 23.5%), and diarrhoea (1.3%, 1.3% and 7.6%). Palbociclib plus ET offered better quality of life (aHR for time to deterioration of global health status: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.53-0.85). CONCLUSIONS There was no statistical superiority of palbociclib plus ET over capecitabine with respect to PFS in MBC patients resistant to AIs.

In this paper, we develop and apply a novel immersogeometric fluid-structure interaction (FSI) framework for the modeling and simulation of the TAVR procedure to study the anchoring ability of the THV. To account for physiological realism, methods are proposed to model and couple the main components of the system, including the arterial wall, blood flow, valve leaflets, skirt, and frame. The THV is first crimped and deployed into an idealized ascending aorta. During the FSI simulation, the radial outward force and friction force between the aortic wall and the THV frame are examined over the entire cardiac cycle. The ratio between these two forces is computed and compared with the experimentally estimated coefficient of friction to study the likelihood of valve migration.","Wu, Michael C H; Muchowski, Heather M; Johnson, Emily L; Rajanna, Manoj R; Hsu, Ming-Chen",Computer methods in applied mechanics and engineering,353,27

Hospital staff from the isolation wards were trained in the safety and proper use of the hazardous materials suit and the proper managing of the biohazard materials. We were not expecting the situation, so we started to create more restrictions than facilities for mothers giving birth. In the context of infection risk for the fetus, scientists still search for vertical transmission evidence, but avail-able data are ambiguous, and more research is needed. Concerning the infant safety and to minimalize the infection risk for medical teams, the first Polish guidelines published by the national consultants in obstetrics, midwifery, neonatology, and perinatology regarding the safest formula of birth were as the following: in the case of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, the cesarean section for epidemic indications should be considered, except in an advanced or rapid labor. In the lately updated consensus (14th May), it was written that because the risk of vertical and intranatal SARS-CoV-2 transmission seemed to be low, the SARS-CoV-2 infection was not the main indication to perform cesarean section for any longer. Regardless of the birth formula, the newborns are separated from their mothers immediately after the labor in Polish obstetrician hospitals.

There are four dengue serotypes (DENV1 to DENV4), and infection with one elicits lifelong immunity to that serotype but offers only transient protection against the other serotypes. Identification of the protective determinants of the human antibody response to DENV is a vital requirement for the design and evaluation of future preventative therapies and treatments. Here, we describe the isolation of a neutralizing antibody from a DENV1-infected patient. The human antibody 14c10 (HM14c10) binds specifically to DENV1. HM14c10 neutralizes the virus principally by blocking virus attachment; at higher concentrations, a post-attachment step can also be inhibited. In vivo studies show that the HM14c10 antibody has antiviral activity at picomolar concentrations. A 7 Å resolution cryoelectron microscopy map of Fab fragments of HM14c10 in a complex with DENV1 shows targeting of a discontinuous epitope that spans the adjacent surface of envelope protein dimers. As found previously, a human antibody specific for the related West Nile virus binds to a similar quaternary structure, suggesting that this could be an immunodominant epitope. These findings provide a structural and molecular context for durable, serotype-specific immunity to DENV infection.","Teoh, Ee Ping; Kukkaro, Petra; Teo, En Wei; Lim, Angeline P C; Tan, Tze Tong; Yip, Andy; Schul, Wouter; Aung, Myint; Kostyuchenko, Victor A; Leo, Yee Sin; Chan, Soh Ha; Smith, Kenneth G C; Chan, Annie Hoi Yi; Zou, Gang; Ooi, Eng Eong; Kemeny, D Michael; Tan, Grace K; Ng, Jowin K W; Ng, Mah Lee; Alonso, Sylvie; Fisher, Dale; Shi, Pei-Yong; Hanson, Brendon J; Lok, Shee-Mei; MacAry, Paul A",Science translational medicine,353,31

Dressings form a key part of ulcer treatment, with clinicians and patients having many different types to choose from including alginate dressings. A clear and current overview of current evidence is required to facilitate decision-making regarding dressing use. OBJECTIVES To compare the effects of alginate wound dressings with no wound dressing or alternative dressings on the healing of foot ulcers in people with diabetes mellitus. SEARCH METHODS We searched The Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 4 January 2012); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 4); Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to December Week 3 2011); Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, January 03, 2012); Ovid EMBASE (1980 to 2011 Week 52); and EBSCO CINAHL (1982 to 30 December 2011). There were no restrictions based on language or date of publication. SELECTION CRITERIA Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that have compared the effects on ulcer healing of alginate dressings with alternative wound dressings or no dressing in the treatment of foot ulcers in people with diabetes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. MAIN RESULTS We included six studies (375 participants) in this review; these compared alginate dressings with basic wound contact dressings, foam dressings and a silver-containing, fibrous-hydrocolloid dressing. Meta analysis of two studies found no statistically significant difference between alginate dressings and basic wound contact dressings: risk ratio (RR) 1.09 (95% CI 0.66 to 1.80). Pooled data from two studies comparing alginate dressings with foam dressings found no statistically significant difference in ulcer healing (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.08). There was no statistically significant difference in the number of diabetic foot ulcers healed when an anti-microbial (silver) hydrocolloid dressing was compared with a standard alginate dressing (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.47). All studies had short follow-up times (six to 12 weeks), and small sample sizes. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Currently there is no research evidence to suggest that alginate wound dressings are more effective in healing foot ulcers in people with diabetes than other types of dressing however many trials in this field are very small. Decision makers may wish to consider aspects such as dressing cost and the wound management properties offered by each dressing type e.g. exudate management.","Dumville, Jo C; O'Meara, Susan; Deshpande, Sohan; Speak, Katharine",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,353,16

Unlike the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, which rapidly disappeared in less than one year, MERS has persisted for over three years. More than 1,600 cases of MERS have been reported worldwide, and the disease carries a worryingly high fatality rate of >30%. A total of 182 MERS-CoV genomes have been sequenced, including 94 from humans and 88 from dromedary camels. The 182 genomes all share >99% identity, indicating minimal variation among MERS-CoV genomes. MERS-CoV is a lineage C Betacoronavirus (ßCoV). MERS-CoV genomes can be roughly divided into two clades: clade A, which contains only a few strains, and clade B, to which most strains belong. In contrast to ORF1ab and structural proteins, the putative proteins encoded by ORF3, ORF4a, ORF4b, ORF5 and ORF8b in the MERS-CoV genome do not share homology with any known host or virus protein, other than those of its closely related lineage C ßCoVs. Human and dromedary viral genomes have intermingled, indicating that multiple camel-to-human transmission events have occurred. The multiple origins of MERS-CoV suggest that the virus has been resident in dromedaries for many years. This is consistent with the detection of anti-MERS-CoV antibodies in dromedary camels as early as the 1980s.","Wernery, U; Lau, S K P; Woo, P C Y",Revue scientifique et technique,353,24

However, the use of REEs in wastewater treatment could mean increased human exposure to lanthanides (Ln) through wastewater effluent discharge to the environment or through water reuse. Information on the toxicity of lanthanides is scarce and, where available, there are conflicting views. Using in vitro bioassays, we assessed lanthanide toxicity by evaluating four relevant endpoints: the change in mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm), intracellular adenosine triphosphate (I-ATP), genotoxicity, and cell viability. At less than 5000 μmol-Ln3+/L, lanthanides increased the Δψm, while above 5000 μmol-Ln3+/L, the Δψm level plummeted. The measure of I-ATP indicated constant levels of ATP up to 250 μmol-Ln3+/L, above which the I-ATP decreased steadily; the concentration of La, Ce, Gd, and Lu that triggered half of the cells to become ATP-inactive is 794, 1505, 1488, 1115 μmol-Ln3+/L, respectively. Although La and Lu accelerated cell death in shorter studies (24 h), chronic studies using three cell growth cycles showed cell recovery. Lanthanides exhibited antagonistic toxicity at less than 1000 μmol-Ln3+/L. However, the introduction of heavy REEs in a solution amplified lanthanide toxicity. Tested lanthanides appear to pose little risk, which could pave the way for lanthanide application in wastewater treatment.","Kajjumba, George William; Attene-Ramos, Matias; Marti, Erica J",The Science of the total environment,353,33

Home care services reflect this emergent preference, allowing older adults to 'age in place' in familiar settings rather than receiving care for chronic health conditions or ageing needs in an institutionalized setting. Numerous social factors, generally studied in isolation, have been associated with home care utilization. Even so, social circumstances are complex and how these factors collectively influence home care use patterns remains unclear. OBJECTIVES To provide a broad and comprehensive overview of the social factors influencing home care utilization; and to evaluate the influence of discrete social factors on patterns of home care utilization in community-dwelling older adults in high-income countries. METHODS A scoping review was conducted of six electronic databases for records published between 2010 and 2020; additional records were obtained from hand searching review articles, reference lists of included studies and documents from international organisations. A narrative synthesis was presented, complemented by vote counting per social factor, harvest plots and an evaluation of aggregated findings to determine consistency across studies. RESULTS A total of 2,365 records were identified, of which 66 met inclusion criteria. There were 35 discrete social factors grouped into four levels of influence using a socio-ecological model (individual, relationship, community and societal levels) and grouped according to outcome of interest (home care propensity and intensity). Across all studies, social factors consistently showing any association (positive, negative, or equivocal in pattern) with home care propensity were: age, ethnicity/race, self-assessed health, insurance, housing ownership, housing problems, marital status, household income, children, informal caregiving, social networks and urban/rural area. Age, education, personal finances, living arrangements and housing ownership were associated with home care intensity, also with variable patterns in utilization. Additional community and societal level factors were identified as relevant but lacking consistency across the literature; these included rurality, availability of community services, methods of financing home care systems, and cultural determinants. CONCLUSION This is the first literature review bringing together a wide range of reported social factors that influence home care utilization. It confirms social factors do influence home care utilization in complex interactions, distinguishes level of influences at which these factors affect patterns of use and discusses policy implications for home care reform.","Mah, Jasmine C; Stevens, Susan J; Keefe, Janice M; Rockwood, Kenneth; Andrew, Melissa K",BMC geriatrics,353,1

This article systematically reviews interventions aiming to address gendered stereotypes and norms across several outcomes of gender inequality such as violence against women and sexual and reproductive health, to draw out common theory and practice and identify success factors. Three databases were searched; ProQuest Central, PsycINFO and Web of Science. Articles were included if they used established public health interventions types (direct participation programs, community mobilisation or strengthening, organisational or workforce development, communications, social marketing and social media, advocacy, legislative or policy reform) to shift attitudes and/or behaviour in relation to rigid gender stereotypes and norms. A total of 71 studies were included addressing norms and/or stereotypes across a range of intervention types and gender inequality outcomes, 55 of which reported statistically significant or mixed outcomes. The implicit theory of change in most studies was to change participants' attitudes by increasing their knowledge/awareness of gendered stereotypes or norms. Five additional strategies were identified that appear to strengthen intervention impact; peer engagement, addressing multiple levels of the ecological framework, developing agents of change, modelling/role models and co-design of interventions with participants or target populations. Consideration of cohort sex, length of intervention (multi-session vs single-session) and need for follow up data collection were all identified as factors influencing success. When it comes to engaging men and boys in particular, interventions with greater success include interactive learning, co-design and peer leadership. Several recommendations are made for program design, including that practitioners need to be cognisant of breaking down stereotypes amongst men (not just between genders) and the avoidance of reinforcing outdated stereotypes and norms inadvertently.","Stewart, Rebecca; Wright, Breanna; Smith, Liam; Roberts, Steven; Russell, Natalie",Heliyon,353,5

At present, we aimed to investigate whether FOXO3 is a target of punicalin to prevent IL-1β- and TNF-α-induced chondrocyte dysfunction in vitro and in vivo models. Cell and mouse models of chondrocyte dysfunction were established to determine the pharmacological value of hydrolyzable tannin, punicalin, which was extracted from the pomegranate. FOXO3 protein levels in the nucleus and cytoplasm were analysed using western blot. Safranine O staining was performed to evaluate the expansion of growth plate and chondrocyte differentiation in IL-1β- and TNF-α-treated mice. In IL-1β- and TNF-α-treated chondrocytes and mice, IL-1β and TNF-α evoked phosphorylation and nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of FOXO3, as well as reduced FOXO3 expression levels in the nucleus. However, punicalin treatment repressed FOXO3 phosphorylation and cytoplasmic transfer. Punicalin treatment improved IL-1β and TNF-α-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis of chondrocyte and the abnormal expansion of growth plate and hypertrophic zone. Moreover, punicalin could maintain the normal phenotype of chondrocyte via mediating multiple gene expression.

Results The 28 case studies varied widely with regard to how efficiency was evaluated, the extent to which efficiency was explored, and how efficiency gains could be achieved. Half of the studies assessed both technical and allocative efficiency, and the other half assessed technical efficiency only. The indicators to examine potential inefficiencies varied substantially among studies. The most frequently cited inefficiencies stemmed from public financial management (budget implementation, budget allocation and strategic purchasing) and governance issues, even though these were characterized in various ways. The second most cited set of inefficiencies that caused health systems to function poorly were those related to health service delivery. Procurement and delivery of input factors was also mentioned in some studies as a source of inefficiency. Though most studies conceded that efficiency gains were a potential means to improve fiscal space for health, very few quantified the potential gains or explored practical mechanisms to translate efficiency gains into fiscal space for health. Conclusions While the conceptual link between efficiency gains and fiscal space for health may be assumed, there is no direct empirical evidence proving that efficiency gains translate into more resources for the health sector. Mechanisms to translate efficiency gains into fiscal space are barely explored in the fiscal space literature. Public financial management rules and related rules for reallocating funds within the sector need to be further examined to guide countries in the transformation of efficiency gains into more resources for health.","Zeng, Wu; Yao, Yao; Barroy, Hélène; Cylus, Jonathan; Li, Guohong",Journal of global health,353,24

Data sources We conducted searches in PubMed/Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), grey literature, and in a centralized repository in L·OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence). L·OVE is a platform that maps PICO questions to evidence from the Epistemonikos database. In response to the COVID-19 emergency, L·OVE was adapted to expand the range of evidence it covers and customized to group all COVID-19 evidence in one place. All the searches covered the period until 23 April 2020 (one day before submission). Eligibility criteria for selecting studies and methods We adapted an already published standard protocol for multiple parallel systematic reviews to the specificities of this question. We searched for randomized trials evaluating the effectiveness and safety of cell-based therapies versus placebo or no treatment in patients with COVID-19. Anticipating the lack of randomized trials directly addressing this question, we also searched for trials evaluating other coronavirus infections, such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and nonrandomized studies in COVID-19. Two reviewers independently screened each study for eligibility. A living, web-based version of this review will be openly available during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will resubmit this review to a peer-reviewed journal every time the conclusions change or whenever there are substantial updates. Results We screened 1 043 records, but no study was considered eligible. We identified 61 ongoing studies, including 39 randomized trials evaluating different types of cell-based therapies in COVID-19. Conclusions We did not find any studies that met our inclusion criteria, and hence there is no evidence to support or refute the use of cell-based therapies for treating patients with COVID-19. A substantial number of ongoing studies should provide valuable evidence to inform researchers and decision-makers in the near future.

DFMBs' ability to simultaneously remove basic magenta (BM, cationic dye) and Congo red (CR, anionic dye) from aqueous solution in single and binary dye systems was investigated. FTIR spectra and Zeta potential analysis results showed that PMDA and TEPA were successfully grafted onto the surface of bagasse, and the ratio of the amount of carboxyl groups and amine groups was controlled by the addition of a dosage of TEPA. Adsorption results showed that adsorption capacities of DFMBs for BM decreased while that for CR increased with the increase of the amount of TEPA in both single and binary dye systems, and BM or CR was absorbed on the modified biosorbents was mainly through electrostatic attraction and hydrogen bond. The adsorption for BM and CR could reach equilibrium within 300 min, both processes were fitted well by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The cationic and anionic dyes removal experiment in the binary system showed that DMFBs could be chosen as adsorbents to treat wastewater containing different ratios of cationic and anionic dyes.","Zhou, Ru-Yi; Yu, Jun-Xia; Chi, Ru-An",Water science and technology : a journal of the International Association on Water Pollution Research,353,30

Parents are primary gatekeepers to children's food intake; however, reaching and engaging parents in nutrition promotion can be challenging. With growth in internet and smartphone use, digital platforms provide potential to disseminate information rapidly to many people. The objectives of this review were to conduct a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of nutrition promotion via websites and apps supporting parents to influence children's nutrition, from three different perspectives: 1) current evidence base, 2) end user (parent) experience and 3) current commercial offerings. METHODS Three systematic reviews were undertaken of (1) studies evaluating the effectiveness for digital platforms for improving nutrition in children and parents, (2) studies conducting user-testing of digital tools with parents, (3) websites and apps providing lunch-provision information to parents. Searches were conducted in five databases for reviews one and two, and systematic search of Google and App Store for review three. Randomised controlled trials, cohort and cross-sectional and qualitative studies (study two only) were included if published in English, from 2013, with the intervention targeted at parents and at least 50% of intervention content focused on nutrition. Search results were double screened, with data extracted into standardised spreadsheets and quality appraisal of included search results. RESULTS Studies evaluating digital nutrition interventions targeting parents (n = 11) demonstrated effectiveness for improving nutrition outcomes, self-efficacy and knowledge. Six of the included randomised controlled trials reported digital interventions to be equal to, or better than comparison groups. User-testing studies (n = 9) identified that digital platforms should include both informative content and interactive features. Parents wanted evidence-based information from credible sources, practical tools, engaging content and connection with other users and health professionals. Websites targeting lunch provision (n = 15) were developed primarily by credible sources and included information-based content consistent with dietary guidelines and limited interactive features. Lunchbox apps (n = 6), developed mostly by commercial organisations, were more interactive but provided less credible information. CONCLUSIONS Digital nutrition promotion interventions targeting parents can be effective for improving nutrition-related outcomes in children and parents. As demonstrated from the lunchbox context and user-testing with parents, they need to go beyond just providing information about positive dietary changes, to include the user-desired features supporting interactivity and personalisation.","Zarnowiecki, Dorota; Mauch, Chelsea E; Middleton, Georgia; Matwiejczyk, Louisa; Watson, Wendy L; Dibbs, Jane; Dessaix, Anita; Golley, Rebecca K",The international journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity,353,24

We determined the long-term impact of RYGB on patients with diabetes and only class I obesity. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Sixty-six consecutively selected diabetic patients with BMI 30-35 kg/m(2) underwent RYGB in a tertiary-care hospital and were prospectively studied for up to 6 years (median 5 years [range 1-6]), with 100% follow-up. Main outcome measures were safety and the percentage of patients experiencing diabetes remission (HbA(1c) <6.5% without diabetes medication). RESULTS Participants had severe, longstanding diabetes, with disease duration 12.5 ± 7.4 years and HbA(1c) 9.7 ± 1.5%, despite insulin and/or oral diabetes medication usage in everyone. For up to 6 years following RYGB, durable diabetes remission occurred in 88% of cases, with glycemic improvement in 11%. Mean HbA(1c) fell from 9.7 ± 1.5 to 5.9 ± 0.1% (P < 0.001), despite diabetes medication cessation in the majority. Weight loss failed to correlate with several measures of improved glucose homeostasis, consistent with weight-independent antidiabetes mechanisms of RYGB. C-peptide responses to glucose increased substantially, suggesting improved β-cell function. There was no mortality, major surgical morbidity, or excessive weight loss. Hypertension and dyslipidemia also improved, yielding 50-84% reductions in predicted 10-year cardiovascular disease risks of fatal and nonfatal coronary heart disease and stroke. CONCLUSIONS This is the largest, longest-term study examining RYGB for diabetic patients without severe obesity. RYGB safely and effectively ameliorated diabetes and associated comorbidities, reducing cardiovascular risk, in patients with a BMI of only 30-35 kg/m(2).","Cohen, Ricardo V; Pinheiro, Jose C; Schiavon, Carlos A; Salles, João E; Wajchenberg, Bernardo L; Cummings, David E",Diabetes care,353,16

The legacies included: publication of a communication policy on case disclosure, a protocol for collaboration between public health and other agencies, and establishing an expert committee to assemble the limited available expertise. There were challenges in taking proportionate and flexible measures in the management of people identified to be at high risk at entry points to Japan, in the decentralised medical response strategy, and in the medical countermeasures preparedness.

We report a successful multitactic strategy for combating the pink bollworm (Pectinophora gossypiella), one of the world's most invasive pests. A coordinated program in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico included releases of billions of sterile pink bollworm moths from airplanes and planting of cotton engineered to produce insecticidal proteins from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). An analysis of computer simulations and 21 y of field data from Arizona demonstrate that the transgenic Bt cotton and sterile insect releases interacted synergistically to reduce the pest's population size. In Arizona, the program started in 2006 and decreased the pest's estimated statewide population size from over 2 billion in 2005 to zero in 2013. Complementary regional efforts eradicated this pest throughout the cotton-growing areas of the continental United States and northern Mexico a century after it had invaded both countries. The removal of this pest saved farmers in the United States $192 million from 2014 to 2019. It also eliminated the environmental and safety hazards associated with insecticide sprays that had previously targeted the pink bollworm and facilitated an 82% reduction in insecticides used against all cotton pests in Arizona.

Numerous studies on the effects of previous infectious outbreaks have been published. Similarly, an increasingly growing body of research on COVID-19 has been developed and released, reporting a substancial psychological impact of both the outbreak and the response, suggesting that the population may express high levels of psychological symptoms.ObjectivesThis presentation aims to synthesize existent literature that reports on the effects of COVID-19 on psychological outcomes of the general population, groups with higher vulnerability and its associated risk factors.MethodsBibliographic research was made through scientific databases such as PubMed and EMBASE. No time limit was used. Pertinent articles were carefully reviewed for additional relevant citations.ResultsGenerally, there is a higher prevalence of symptoms of adverse psychiatric outcomes among the public when compared to the prevalence before the pandemic. Psychological reactions to pandemics include maladaptive behaviours, emotional distress and symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression, and avoidance behaviors. The groups known to be at higher risk for mental health problems during the pandemic are: women, healthcare workers, people under 40 years old and with chronic diseases. Other risk factors are: frequent exposure to social media/news relating to COVID-19, poor economic status, lower education level, and unemployment.ConclusionsThe COVID-19 pandemic represents an unprecedented threat to mental health.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the admission and treatment of patients with coronary artery diseases (CADs) by examining coronary Cath labs activities in some centers of Iran during the COVID-19 period. METHODS: A retrospective, multi-center survey was conducted in four cites in Iran which participated in National Persian Registry Of CardioVascular diseasE (N-PROVE). Two periods of COVID-19 occurrence peak in Iran were compared with the same date in 2019. Information was collected on the number of diagnostic and therapeutic coronary catheterizations in both stable ischemic heart diseases (SIHDs) and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) settings. RESULTS: In the first peak of COVID-19 pandemic, coronary angiographies and angioplasties decreased by 37 and 38% compared to the same period in 2019, respectively. The most common indication for coronary angiography during this period was ACS [especially ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI)];however, at the time of peak decrease, the SIHDs were the most. In the second peak of COVID-19 pandemic in Iran, 34% and 27% decrease in diagnostic and therapeutic coronary procedures were seen, respectively. During this period, the number of elective admissions increased, although it was still lower than that in 2019. The tendency to rescue percutaneous coronary intervention increased in most centers during the COVID-19 era, especially in the second peak.

Since students grow up in an environment already shaped by technology, the assumption arises that such virtual teaching methods, especially those integrating immersive technology, could enhance the learning process of the students. Especially in the subject Religion, abstract, often intangible topics without immediate relation to the students' everyday lives are addressed, resulting in students lack of motivation and interest. As several theories and studies have already shown that digitized forms of learning have a supporting effect on factors relevant for students' learning, a virtual learning environment for learning the topic 'Professions in Jerusalem' of the subject Religion was developed, which is a market place in Bethlehem in the time of Jesus. As a time-traveling journalist, the player has the task of interviewing the various profession groups in order to write a newspaper article as the final product. To support the assumption that this virtual experience can foster learning in Religion classrooms, a small sample of ten preservice teachers was used to carry out a first pilot evaluation of the experience. The results of a pre-/post-test comparison give first indicators that factors influencing learning processes in the Religion classroom can be increased through game-based religion education experiences. To address some of the issues that occured during the study, the promotion and expansion of digitization seems to be of great priority to realize immersive teaching settings in the future. © 2021 Immersive Learning Research Network.","Wetzel, V.; Dengel, A.","7th International Conference of the Immersive Learning Research Network, iLRN 2021",353,24

The results indicate that more sustainable firms exhibit a more stable dividend payout. This result is also valid when the ESG pillars are analysed, specifically, the environmental and governance pillars. The findings further suggest that higher ESG scores reveal better long-term alignment with shareholders and other stakeholders due to more proportionally stable profit sharing.","Barros, Victor Joaquim Miranda Sarmento",Sustainability,353,16

Thus, we assessed the relationship of the COVID-19 pandemic with quality of life (QOL) and depression symptoms in patients newly diagnosed with advanced lung cancer. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of patients with advanced lung cancer enrolled in two multisite randomized supportive care trials. We enrolled adult patients within 12 weeks of diagnosis of advanced lung cancer and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status from 0 to 3 across 23 institutions in the United States. At the time of enrollment, participants completed the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung (FACT-L), which includes four wellbeing subscales (i.e., physical, social, emotional, and functional) as well as lung cancer symptoms, and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) to assess their QOL and depression symptoms, respectively. We compared QOL and depression symptoms between participants enrolled prior to COVID-19 (i.e., those enrolled in the following time periods: March 2018 to January 2019 and March 2019 to January 2020) and during the COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020 to January 2021). We used linear regression models adjusting for age, race, gender, and time since diagnosis of advanced cancer to examine the relationship between the period of enrollment and patients' QOL and depression symptoms. Results: A total of 860 patients were included in this analysis (665 participants enrolled prior to COVID-19 and 195 participants during COVID-19). The two cohorts did not differ significantly with respect to baseline demographic factors [Mean age 65.4 (SD = 11.4), 51.9% female]. In multivariate regression models, enrollment during COVID-19 was not associated with physical (B = -0.16, SE = 0.52, P = 0.763), social (B = -0.48, SE = 0.39, P = 0.217), emotional (B = -0.16, SE = 0.41, P = 0.693), functional (B = -0.83, SE = 0.55, P = 0.128) wellbeing, or lung cancer symptoms (B = -0.11, SE = 0.44, P = 0.806). Enrollment during COVID-19 was not associated with overall QOL (FACT-L: B = -1.32, SE = 1.69, P = 0.436) or depression symptoms (PHQ-9: B = -0.02, SE = 0.45, P = 0.973). Conclusions: Despite the prevailing belief that COVID-19 has negatively impacted QOL and distress in patients with cancer, we found no differences in QOL or depression symptoms in patients newly diagnosed with advanced lung cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to those diagnosed prior to the pandemic. These findings suggest that factors other than the COVID- 19 pandemic, such as patients' experience with their cancer, contribute to their QOL and depression symptoms.","Heuer, L.; Post, K.

However, quantitative analysis by manual microscopy is subject to observer bias, slide distribution errors, statistical sampling error, recording errors, and is inherently burdensome from time management and workflow efficiency standpoints. As such, methods for the automated measurement of percent parasitemia in digital microscopic images of peripheral blood smears could improve clinical accuracy, relative to the predicate method. Methods: Individual erythrocyte images (shape: 70x70x3) were manually labeled as ""parasite"" or ""normal"" and were used to train a model for binary image classification. The best model was then used to calculate percent parasitemia from a clinical validation dataset, and values were compared to a clinical reference value. Lastly, model interpretability was examined using an integrated gradient to identify pixels most likely to influence classification decisions. Results: The precision and recall of the model during development testing were 0.92 and 1.00, respectively. In clinical validation, the model returned increasing positive signal with increasing mean reference value. However, there were two highly erroneous false positive values returned by the model. Lastly, the model incorrectly assessed three cases well above the clinical threshold of 10%. The integrated gradient suggested potential sources of false positives including rouleaux formations, cell boundaries, and precipitate as deterministic factors in negative erythrocyte images. Conclusions: While the model demonstrated highly accurate single cell classification and correctly assessed most slides, several false positives were highly incorrect. This project highlights the need for integrated testing of ML-based models, even when models in the development phase perform well.","Durant, T. J.; Dudgeon, S.

Equal channel angular extrusion/pressing (ECAE/ECAP) is an effective technique to severely deform material and refine grains, however, the drawback is that a continuous process on sheet metal is confined due to the process mechanism. Equal channel angular drawing (ECAD), a continuous strip drawing process, has limitations in achieving grain refinement because drawing is a stretching phenomenon contrary to an extrusion or pressing process. In the present work, experiments were conducted on interstitial-free (IF) steel to demonstrate that grain refinement of thin sheets can be achieved through pack extrusion; and while there was shear deformation, ECAD failed to produce UFG microstructure. The finite element analysis showed the sheet metals have distinctive stress-strain states after ECAE and ECAD. The feasibility of combining ECAE and ECAD to approach the stress-strain state of the sheet metal in pack extrusion for grain refinement was investigated. Simulation results showed that with proper loading conditions, continuous grain refinement of thin metal strips is sufficiently possible.","Ha, T.; Murudkar, R.; Hartwig, K.

Since the subcellular localization of the viral glycoproteins of enveloped viruses can be one of the factors determining the cellular site of particle assembly and release, experiments were performed to determine if this property was altered by coexpression of the recombinant HIV-1 glycoproteins. When wild-type virus was compared to mutant virus encoding the intracellularly retained glycoproteins, the extent of HIV-1 particle release into the extracellular medium remained unaffected, and electron-microscopic analysis did not reveal any significant alteration in the cellular sites of particle assembly and budding.

Twenty-one percent of these patients required admission to the medical intensive care unit. During this period, the Center for Forensic Medicine, Health Sciences Authority, Singapore, performed a total of 14 postmortem examinations for probable and suspected SARS. Of these, a total of 8 were later confirmed as SARS infections. OBJECTIVE Our series documents the difficulties encountered at autopsy during the initial phases of the SARS epidemic, when the pattern of infection and definitive diagnostic laboratory criteria were yet to be established. DESIGN Autopsies were performed by pathologists affiliated with the Center for Forensic Medicine, Health Sciences Authority, Singapore. Tissue was accessed and read at the Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore, and at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Washington, DC. Autopsy tissue was submitted to the Virology Department, Singapore General Hospital, for analysis, and in situ hybridization for the SARS coronavirus was carried out at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan. RESULTS Thirteen of 14 patients showed features of diffuse alveolar damage. In 8 patients, no precipitating etiology was identified, and in all of these patients, we now have laboratory confirmation of coronavirus infection. Two of the 8 patients presented at autopsy as sudden unexpected deaths, while the remaining 6 patients had been hospitalized with varying lengths of stay in the intensive care unit. In 3 patients, including the 2 sudden unexpected deaths, in situ hybridization showed the presence of virally infected cells within the lung. In 4 of the 8 SARS patients, pulmonary thromboemboli were also recognized on gross examination, while one patient had marantic cardiac valvular vegetations. CONCLUSIONS It is unfortunate that the term atypical pneumonia has been used in conjunction with SARS. Although nonspecific by itself, the term does not accurately reflect the underlying dangers of viral pneumonia, which may progress rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome. We observed that the clinical spectrum of disease as seen in our autopsy series included sudden deaths. This is a worrisome finding that illustrates that viral diseases will have a spectrum of clinical presentations and that the diagnoses made for such patients must incorporate laboratory as well as clinical data.","Chong, Pek Yoon; Chui, Paul; Ling, Ai E; Franks, Teri J; Tai, Dessmon Y H; Leo, Yee Sin; Kaw, Gregory J L; Wansaicheong, Gervais; Chan, Kwai Peng; Ean Oon, Lynette Lin; Teo, Eng Swee; Tan, Kong Bing; Nakajima, Noriko; Sata, Tetsutaro; Travis, William D",Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,353,5

Their multiplication in the differentiated enterocytes of the intestinal tract induces a severe diarrheic syndrome which may lead to death. To study these viruses and to progress in the development of prophylactic and diagnostic methods, it is essential to succeed in adapting the agents to serial growth in cell culture. In spite of several attempts adaptation to primary cell cultures could be obtained in the past only for two isolates. The present work describes the methodology which enabled us to succeed in the adaptation of a bovine enteric coronavirus isolated in France to primary calf kidney cells, and reports results on the characteristics of this virus. Adaptation to serial growth was realized at 34 degrees C in the following way: 3 passages each lasting 8 to 10 days followed by 16 passages each lasting 6 days. From the 20th passage on the duration of incubation was reduced to 4 days. Virus growth was checked using an indirect immunofluorescence test. During the first passages only a few dispersed positive cells could be observed but later on small foci of immunofluorescent cells did appear. By the 35th passage infective titers did not exceed 1 x 10(5) TCID50/ml and cytopathic effects were always very discrete. When the susceptibility of different cell-types to this coronavirus strain (G110) was checked we found that only bovine cells and the human HRT18 cell-line were able to replicate the virus. In HRT18 cells titers as high as 5 x 10(7) TCID50/ml could be obtained at the first passage of G110 strain, previously adapted to primary calf kidney cells. As regards the antigenic properties of G110 virus no difference could be established between this strain and the Nebraska isolate (NCDCV) neither by indirect immunofluorescence test nor by indirect neutralization test. The G110 strain agglutinates rat and mouse erythrocytes. The density of purified virions in mouse gradients is 1.19 and the morphology of the particles is characteristic of a coronavirus.","L'Haridon, R; Scherrer, R; Vautherot, J F; La Bonnardière, C; Laporte, J; Cohen, J",Annales de recherches veterinaires.

Although this disease is per se rather harmless, HRV infection is considered to set the stage for more dangerous pathogens in vivo. Here we demonstrate that HRV-14, a member of the major group HRV family, can efficiently inhibit antigen-induced T-cell proliferation and T-cell responses to allogeneic monocytes. HRV-14 triggered a significant downregulation of MHC class II molecules on monocytes. Moreover, supernatants from monocytes cultured in the presence of HRV-14 strongly reduced the allogeneic T-cell stimulatory property of untreated monocytes and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (md-DCs), whereas Epstein Barr virus-transformed B-lymphoblastoid cells were not sensitive. Analysis of the supernatant revealed that HRV-14 induced the production of significant amounts of the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10. The important T-cell stimulatory cytokine IL-12 or the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1beta or TNF-alpha were not detected or were only minimally detected. Finally, monocytes pretreated with HRV-14 were greatly inhibited in their production of IL-12 upon stimulation with IFN-gamma/LPS. These observations suggest that altered cytokine production in mononuclear phagocytes upon interaction with HRV downmodulates appropriate immune responses during the viral infection.","Stöckl, J; Vetr, H; Majdic, O; Zlabinger, G; Kuechler, E; Knapp, W",The Journal of clinical investigation,353,11

Resistance to an HR2-based peptide inhibitor of a model retrovirus, subgroup A of the Avian Sarcoma and Leukosis Virus genus (ASLV-A), was studied by examining mutants derived by viral passage in the presence of inhibitor. Variants with reduced sensitivity to inhibitor were readily selected in vitro. Sensitivity determinants were identified for 13 different isolates, all of which mapped to the TM subunit. These determinants were identified in two regions: (i) the N-terminal heptad repeat (HR1) and (ii) the N-terminal segment of TM, between the subunit cleavage site and the fusion peptide. The latter class of mutants identified a region outside of the predicted HR2-binding site that can significantly alter sensitivity to inhibitor. A subset of the HR1 mutants displayed the unanticipated ability to infect nonavian cells. This expanded tropism was associated with increased efficiency of envelope triggering by soluble receptor at low temperatures, as measured by protease sensitivity of the surface subunit (SU) of envelope.

The aim of this study was to investigate changes of death patterns in Macao residents from 1986 to 2006 in order to identify the trends and patterns of major public health problems, which could provide the guidance for developing public health policies. METHODS A retrospective study was conducted for this investigation. Research data were collected from official websites and statistical yearbooks and classified by the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9. RESULTS It was observed that mortality from the three major causes of (1) infectious, maternal and childhood diseases, (2) chronic non-communicable diseases, and (3) injury and poisoning were 17.7, 298.2 and 26.0 per 100 000, respectively. The largest decrease in death rate over the 21-year study-period was from infectious, maternal and childhood diseases (62.5%). The highest mortality rate was ischemic heart diseases (37.0%). The largest increase in mortality rate was lung cancer (46.9%). CONCLUSIONS Mortality rate of Macao residents progressively decreased, but the constituent ratio of death from chronic non-communicable diseases was increasing. The mortality rate of lung cancer was clearly ascending, so emphasis should be put on tertiary prevention in future.","Chan, Man-si; Chen, Qing; Lam, Christopher Wai-kei",Chinese medical journal,353,1

Comparative sequence analysis showed that the chicken parvovirus (ChPV) represented a new member in the Parvoviridae family. Here, we describe some of the pathogenic characteristics of ChPV in young broilers. Following experimental infection, 2-day-old broiler chickens showed characteristic signs of enteric disease. Runting-stunting syndrome (RSS) was observed in four of five experimental groups with significant growth retardation between 7 and 28 days postinoculation (DPI). Viral growth in small intestine and shedding was detected at early times postinoculation, which was followed by viremia and generalization of infection. ChPV could be detected in most of the major tissues for 3 to 4 wk postinoculation. Immunohistochemistry staining revealed parvovirus-positive cells in the duodenum of inoculated birds at 7 and 14 DPI. Our data indicate that ChPV alone induces RSS in broilers and is important determinant in the complex etiology of enteric diseases of poultry.","Zsak, Laszlo; Cha, Ra Mi; Day, J Michael",Avian diseases,353,26

According to the Health Belief Model (HBM), health-related behavior is determined by perceived barriers and motivators. Using an online survey with 1669 respondents, we sought to understand why and how physical activity and sedentary behavior has changed by querying about perceived barriers and motivators to physical activity that changed because of the pandemic, and how those changes impacted mental health. The following results were statistically significant at p < .05. Consistent with prior reports, our respondents were less physically active (aerobic activity, -11%; strength-based activity, -30%) and more sedentary (+11%) during the pandemic as compared to 6-months before. The pandemic also increased psychological stress (+22%) and brought on moderate symptoms of anxiety and depression. Respondents' whose mental health deteriorated the most were also the ones who were least active (depression r = -.21, anxiety r = -.12). The majority of respondents were unmotivated to exercise because they were too anxious (+8%,), lacked social support (+6%), or had limited access to equipment (+23%) or space (+41%). The respondents who were able to stay active reported feeling less motivated by physical health outcomes such as weight loss (-7%) or strength (-14%) and instead more motivated by mental health outcomes such as anxiety relief (+14%). Coupled with previous work demonstrating a direct relationship between mental health and physical activity, these results highlight the potential protective effect of physical activity on mental health and point to the need for psychological support to overcome perceived barriers so that people can continue to be physically active during stressful times like the pandemic.","Marashi, Maryam Yvonne; Nicholson, Emma; Ogrodnik, Michelle; Fenesi, Barbara; Heisz, Jennifer J",PLoS One,353,15

We aimed to assess the characteristics of HA-CDI acquired during and before the COVID-19 pandemic.Methods We conducted a retrospective study in a tertiary care hospital, in which since March 2020 exclusively COVID-19 patients are hospitalized. We compared HA-CDI adult patients hospitalized in March 2020-February 2021 with those hospitalized during the same period in 2017-2018.Results We found 51 cases during 2020-2021 (COVID-19 group), incidence 5.6/1000 adult discharge and 99 cases during 2017-2018 (pre-COVID-19 group), incidence 6.1/1000 adult discharge (p=0.6). The patients in COVID-19 group compared to pre-COVID-19 group were older (median age 66 vs 62 years), with similar rate of comorbidities, but with higher rate of cardiovascular diseases (62.7% vs 42.4%) and less immunosuppression (21.6% vs 55.6%), they had a higher proton pump inhibitors use (94.1% vs 32.3%), and a longer hospitalization (median 19 vs 14 days).Eighty-five (85.9%) patients in pre-COVID-19 group versus 44 (86.3%) patients in COVID-19 group received antimicrobial treatment - mainly cephalosporins (34,1%), quinolones (22,3%) and glycopeptides (21,1%) in pre-COVID-19 group and mainly cephalosporins and macrolides (63,6% each) in COVID-19 group. We found four HA-CDI-related deaths in pre-COVID-19 group and none in the COVID-19 group.Conclusions The HA-CDI incidence in COVID-19 group did not change versus the same period of time during 2017-2018. The antibiotic use was the most important factor associated with HA-CDI. We identified a high use of broad-spectrum antibiotics despite the lack of empirical antimicrobial recommendations in COVID-19.What is important: Information on healthcare-acquired C.difficile in COVID-19 patients is limited, but not only C.difficile infection remains a worrying issue, but is also an emerging topic. We found that antibiotic use seems to be the most important factor associated with CDI and our data emphasize the need for rational use of antibiotics and for ongoing attention regarding CDI in COVID-19 patients.","Manea, Eliza; Jipa, Raluca; Milea, Alexandru; Roman, Antonia; Neagu, Georgiana; Hristea, Adriana",Rom. j. intern. med,353,16

Method: A retrospective analysis at a single UK MTC. We included all patients undergoing emergency/urgent T&O surgery. Data collected included anatomical injury site, mechanism of injury, operative procedure, anaesthesia, theatre time, complications, and 30-day mortality. Results: 159 operations were performed on 142 patients in April 2019, and 110 operations on 106 patients in April 2020 (national lockdown). This led to a decrease of 30% due to reduced numbers from RTAs and sport-related injuries. Volumes of hip fractures and injuries from lowenergy falls remained the same. Operative total theatre time increased by a mean of 14 minutes, and complications and mortality were not significantly changed. The incidence of COVID-19 in the patients tested was 8.5%, which matched the population incidence at the time. Conclusion: Orthopaedic trauma services must be maintained during a national lockdown. There is no decrease in the volume of patients sustaining falls, including hip fractures. Mean operating time only increases by 14 minutes with the wearing of PPE. This should be part of future planning of any pandemics or national lockdowns.","Donovan, R.; Tilston, T.; Frostick, R.; Chesser, T.",British Journal of Surgery,353,1

Upon deswelling, the PDMS block is trapped in the PDMS matrix while the PEO, as a hydrophilic block, is tethered to the surface. The PEO-tethered layer showed stability when treated in water for 16 h. The surface fraction of PEO and the wetting property of the PEO-tethered PDMS surface can be controlled by the cross linking density of the PDMS matrix.

Whether the COVID-19 pandemic has altered perceptions, motivation to quit, or tobacco use among cigarette smokers and nicotine e-cigarette vapers with OUD is unknown. METHODS: A telephone survey was conducted in March-July 2020 of current cigarette smokers or nicotine vapers with OUD who were stable on buprenorphine treatment at five Boston (MA) area community health centers. The survey assessed respondents' perceived risk of COVID-19 due to smoking or vaping, interest in quitting, quit attempts and change in tobacco consumption during the pandemic. RESULTS: 222/520 patients (43 %) completed the survey, and 145 were asked questions related to COVID-19. Of these, 61 % smoked cigarettes only, 13 % vaped nicotine only, and 26 % were dual users. Nearly 80 % of participants believed that smoking and vaping increased their risk of COVID-19 infection or complications. Smokers with this belief reported an increased interest in quitting (AOR 4.6, 95 % CI:1.7-12.4). Overall, 49 % of smokers and 42 % of vapers reported increased interest in quitting due to the pandemic; 24 % and 20 %, respectively, reported attempting to quit since the pandemic. However, 35 % of smokers and 27 % of vapers reported increasing smoking and vaping, respectively, during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with OUD believed that smoking and vaping increased their vulnerability to COVID-19, half reported increased interest in quitting, but others reported increasing smoking and vaping during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Streck, Joanna M; Kalkhoran, Sara; Bearnot, Benjamin; Gupta, Priya S; Kalagher, Kelly M; Regan, Susan; Wakeman, Sarah; Rigotti, Nancy A",Drug Alcohol Depend,353,27

Methods: An online survey, containing 31 questions, was conducted among medical doctors using a secure Google forms link. The survey was open for 48 hours from 16th-18th April 2020. Results: Responses were received from 556 physicians (including 266 ophthalmologists). About a third (n = 205) wanted to start OP immediately after lockdown. In OP, mask of any kind for patient (60.8%), 3-ply for assistants (52.7%) and N95 for doctors (72.7%) were most common preferences. In OP, 31.5% and 46.6% felt full PPE and gloves alone were sufficient respectively. Ophthalmologists were more likely to start immediately after lockdown compared to other specialists (P = 0.004). Among 299 surgeons, an almost equal number (27%) wanted to start routine OT services immediately and 2 weeks post lockdown. A large majority (76.9%) would mandate COVID-19 tests before elective surgeries. In OT, 34.1% wanted N95 for surgical team and 3-ply for patient, 23.4% wanted 3-ply masks for everyone. 40.5% felt additional personal protective equipment (PPE) is not required and 33.1% felt that full PPE is required for everyone in OT. Ophthalmic surgeons preferred 3-ply masks and were less inclined to use full PPE (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Perspectives of doctors vary, especially with regarding to timing of restarting services and precautions to be taken in the OT.

This paper contrasts the framework of financial risk-sharing and the configuration and management of health service providers in these two high-income, small-population countries. Two main institutional distinctions emerge from this country case comparison: (1) Key differences exist in the practical configuration of solidarity for payment of health care services, reflecting differing cultural roots and social expectations, which in turn carry substantial implications for financing long-term care and pensions. (2) Differing arrangements exist in the organization of health service institutions, in particular balancing public as against private sector responsibilities for owning, operating and managing these two countries' respective hospitals. These different structural characteristics generate fundamental differences in health sector financial and delivery outcomes in one developed country in Far East Asia as compared with a well-respected tax-funded health system in Western Europe. In the post-COVID era, as Western European policymakers find themselves forced to adjust their publicly funded health systems to (further) reductions in economic growth rates and overall tax receipts, and as the cost of the information revolution continues to rise while efforts to fund better coordinated social and home care services for growing numbers of chronically ill elderly remain inadequate, this two-country case comparison highlights a series of health system design questions that could potentially provide alternative health sector financing and service delivery strategies.","Saltman, Richard B; Yeh, Ming-Jui; Liu, Yu",Health Econ Policy Law,353,24

The state of infection, with serious respiratory dysfunction, causes tissues to become hypoxic due to a discrepancy between cellular O2 uptake and consumption similar to that seen within tumor tissue during the progression of numerous solid cancers. In this context, the heterogeneous clinical behavior and the multiorgan deterioration of COVID-19 are discussed as a function of the upregulated expression of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) and of the metabolic reprogramming associated with HIF-1 and with a proinflammatory innate immune response activation, independent of the increase in the viral load of SARS-CoV-2. Possible pharmacological strategies targeting O2 aimed to improve prognosis are suggested.","Ferraro, Elisabetta; Germanò, Maria; Mollace, Rocco; Mollace, Vincenzo; Malara, Natalia",Oxid Med Cell Longev,353,30

Due to hesitation toward the vaccine, it is crucial to explore the acceptability of the COVID-19 vaccine to the public and healthcare workers. In this cross-sectional survey, we invited 2251 pediatricians and 506 (22%) of them responded survey and 424 (84%) gave either nasopharyngeal swap or antibody assay for COVID-19 and 71 (14%) of them got diagnosis of COVID-19. If the effective and safe COVID-19 vaccine was launched on market, 420 (83%) of pediatrician accepted to get vaccine shot, 422 (83%) of them recommended vaccination to their family members, 380 (75%) of them accepted to vaccine their children and 445 (85%) of them offered vaccination to their pediatric patients. Among the participated pediatricians 304 (60%) of them thought COVID-19 vaccine should be mandatory. We found that there are high COVID-19 vaccine willingness rates for pediatricians for themselves, their own children, family members and their pediatric patients. We also found that being a pediatric subspecialist, believing in achieving an effective vaccine, willingness to participate in the phase 1-2 clinical vaccine trial, willingness to get an influenza shot this season, believing a vaccine and vaccine passport should be mandatory were significant factors in accepting the vaccine. It is important to share all information about COVID-19 vaccines, especially effectiveness and safety, with the public in a clear communication and transparency. The opposite will contribute to vaccine hesitancy and anti-vaccine movement.","Gönüllü, Erdem; Soysal, Ahmet; Atici, Serkan; Engin, Mesut; Yesilbas, Osman; Kasap, Tuba; Fedakar, Atiye; Bilgiç, Emre; Tavil, Emine Betül; Tutak, Ercan; Yildiz, Ismail; Akçay, Teoman; Agladioglu, Sebahat Yilmaz; Tunç, Turan; Can, Ilkay; Karaböcüoglu, Metin; Karabayir, Nalan",Hum Vaccin Immunother,353,16

This includes rituximab, oblinutuzumab and ofatumumab that are used in cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and off-label in a large number of other autoimmunities and ocrelizumab in multiple sclerosis. Recently, the COVID-19 pandemic created concerns about immunosuppression in autoimmunity, leading to cessation or a delay in immunotherapy treatments. However, based on the known and emerging biology of autoimmunity and COVID-19, it was hypothesised that while B cell depletion should not necessarily expose people to severe SARS-CoV-2-related issues, it may inhibit protective immunity following infection and vaccination. As such, drug-induced B cell subset inhibition, that controls at least some autoimmunities, would not influence innate and CD8 T cell responses, which are central to SARS-CoV-2 elimination, nor the hypercoagulation and innate inflammation causing severe morbidity. This is supported clinically, as the majority of SARS-CoV-2-infected, CD20-depleted people with autoimmunity have recovered. However, protective neutralizing antibody and vaccination responses are predicted to be blunted until naive B cells repopulate, based on B cell repopulation kinetics and vaccination responses, from published rituximab and unpublished ocrelizumab (NCT00676715, NCT02545868) trial data, shown here. This suggests that it may be possible to undertake dose interruption to maintain inflammatory disease control, while allowing effective vaccination against SARS-CoV-29, if and when an effective vaccine is available.","Baker, D; Roberts, C A K; Pryce, G; Kang, A S; Marta, M; Reyes, S; Schmierer, K; Giovannoni, G; Amor, S",Clin Exp Immunol,353,15

It is expected that the numbers will dramatically rise during the COVID-19 pandemic. Established medications are not sufficient to adequately treat depression and are not available for everyone. Plants from traditional medicine may be promising alternatives to treat depressive symptoms. The model organism Chaenorhabditis elegans was used to assess the stress reducing effects of methanol/dichlormethane extracts from plants used in traditional medicine. After initial screening for antioxidant activity, nine extracts were selected for in vivo testing in oxidative stress, heat stress, and osmotic stress assays. Additionally, anti-aging properties were evaluated in lifespan assay. The extracts from Acanthopanax senticosus, Campsis grandiflora, Centella asiatica, Corydalis yanhusuo, Dan Zhi, Houttuynia cordata, Psoralea corylifolia, Valeriana officinalis, and Withaniasomnifera showed antioxidant activity of more than 15 Trolox equivalents per mg extract. The extracts significantly lowered ROS in mutants, increased resistance to heat stress and osmotic stress, and the extended lifespan of the nematodes. The plant extracts tested showed promising results in increasing stress resistance in the nematode model.

However, in 2020, the threat of the Covid-19 pandemic emerged, which hit all sectors of the economy, including the fisheries sector. Many communities, especially coastal fishing communities, are complaining about economic hardship. Income has fallen dramatically because people’s purchasing power has fallen significantly. Based on these problems, this research was conducted to build a fishers’ income prediction model. This research took a case study on fishers in Karanggongso District Trenggalek by surveying 50 fishing households. There were 12 predictors variables, namely Boat Type (X1), Price Boat (X2), Age of the Boat (X3), Boat Power (X4), Machine Price (X5), Engine Life (X6), Fishing Equipment Price (X7), Fishing Gear Life (X8), Cool Box (X9), Trip/week (X10), Average Hours/trip (X11), and Total Expenditures/week (X12). The response variable is Income Per Week (Y). Data analysis was done by using multiple linear regression analysis and flexible modelling with a machine learning approach. Based on the results of the analysis, a multiple linear regression model had an accuracy level of R 2 = 70.5% and MSE = 1.086 × 1018 with the boat price was the most dominant influence on fishers’ income. While flexible modelling has an accuracy level of R 2 = 85.2% and MSE = 3.308 × 1014. From this research, it was proven that the flexible model had a higher level of accuracy than the linear regression model. Also, the flexible model obtained the nonlinear effect on the number of cool boxes and the fishing gear life.","Sulistyono, A. D.; Susilo, E.; Purwanti, P.; Wardani, N. H.",IOP Conference Series.

Hospitalized patients negative for SARS-CoV-2 were used as controls.RESULTSWe found that the immune landscape in COVID-19 formed 3 dominant clusters, which correlated with disease severity. Longitudinal analysis identified a pattern of productive innate and adaptive immune responses in individuals who had a moderate disease course, whereas those with severe disease had features suggestive of a protracted and dysregulated immune response. Further, we identified coordinate immune alterations accompanying clinical improvement and decline that were also seen in patients who received IL-6 pathway blockade.CONCLUSIONThe hospitalized COVID-19 negative cohort allowed us to identify immune alterations that were shared between severe COVID-19 and other critically ill patients. Collectively, our findings indicate that selection of immune interventions should be based in part on disease presentation and early disease trajectory due to the profound differences in the immune response in those with mild to moderate disease and those with the most severe disease.FUNDINGBenaroya Family Foundation, the Leonard and Norma Klorfine Foundation, Glenn and Mary Lynn Mounger, and the National Institutes of Health.","Bolouri, Hamid; Speake, Cate; Skibinski, David; Long, S Alice; Hocking, Anne M; Campbell, Daniel J; Hamerman, Jessica A; Malhotra, Uma; Buckner, Jane H",J. clin. invest,353,1

In this work we challenge these assumptions. We not only show that there are not enough smartphones worldwide to reach required adoption thresholds but also highlight a broad lack of internet access, which affects certain groups more: the elderly, those with lower incomes, and those with limited ability to socially distance.

Some of the biological effects of nicotine are well documented in in vitro and in vivo systems; however, data are scarce concerning the time-dependent changes on protein and phosphorylation events in response to nicotine. Here, we profiled the proteomes of SH-SY5Y and A549 cell lines subjected to acute (15 min, 1 h and 4 h) or chronic (24 h, 48 h) nicotine exposures. We used sample multiplexing (TMTpro16) and quantified more than 9000 proteins and over 7000 phosphorylation events per cell line. Among our findings, we determined a decrease in mitochondrial protein abundance for SH-SY5Y, while we detected alterations in several immune pathways, such as the complement system, for A549 following nicotine treatment.

FBG feedback enhances the stability of P1 oscillations compared to the conventional mirror feedback in the form of P1 microwave linewidth and phase noise reduction and residual noise peaks suppression. In the proposed scheme, the FBG has a narrow bandwidth smaller than the laser relaxation oscillation frequency. Then it effectively suppresses the coherence collapse of the laser by filtered feedback. Hence it can keep the laser in P1 operation even under relatively strong feedback. Besides, a uniform FBG has a comb-filtered reflectivity spectrum with a main lobe surrounded by several side lobes. Hence it can limit the external cavity modes by each lobe. As a result, FBG feedback can reduce microwave linewidth and phase noise by sustaining stronger feedback power and improve side-peak suppression ratio (SPSR) by filtering external cavity modes. The effects of stabilization are enhanced by properly increasing grating bandwidth. By fine-tuning the feedback delay time, the microwave linewidth can be reduced to a local minimum which reveals the optimal locking between P1 frequency and one of the external cavity modes. Increasing the feedback delay time, the local minimum linewidth can be further reduced. FBG feedback reduces the microwave linewidth by up to more than an order of magnitude and improves the SPSR by up to more than two orders of magnitude than mirror feedback using the same delay time.","Li, Song-Sui; Zou, Xihua; Wang, Longsheng; Wang, Anbang; Pan, Wei; Yan, Lianshan",Opt Express,353,13

Nefamostat, a FDA approved drug, well-known as a serine protease inhibitor for MERS-CoV infection, was used as the reference compound. Both the biflavones, showed potential as inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated viral entry. The binding affinities of these naturally occurring biflavones for RBD-S2 subunit protein of SARS-CoV-2 were explored for the first time. Such binding affinities play a critical role in the virus-cell membrane fusion process. These biflavones are able to interact more strongly with the residues of heptad repeat 1 and 2 (HR1 and HR2) regions of S2 protein of SARS-CoV-2 compared to nefamostat, and thus, these biflavones can effectively block the formation of six-helix bundle core fusion structure (6-HB) leading to the inhibition of virus-target cell-membrane fusion.","Mondal, Samiran; Karmakar, Abhijit; Mallick, Tamanna; Begum, Naznin Ara",Virology,353,26

Para isso, foram realizadas projeções de investimentos e analisadas as condições de operacionalização do programa no momento atual. Foi adotada uma metodologia quanti-quali de análise. Na abordagem quantitativa, foram construídos cenários com projeções de investimentos na política pública; na qualitativa, realizaram-se entrevistas não estruturadas com atores-chave na execução do programa. Os resultados revelaram que o aumento de recursos investidos no programa em um cenário otimizado pode proporcionar ampla capilarização dos benefícios. Identificou-se que o PAA é estratégico para o enfrentamento aos efeitos negativos da COVID-19 porque escoa os produtos da agricultura familiar, o que promove estruturação de cadeias produtivas, acesso a novos mercados e indução ao dinamismo econômico, além de atuar no combate à fome e à miséria de famílias que vivem em situação de vulnerabilidade. O programa não só apresenta condições de operacionalização durante a pandemia da COVID-19, como tem se adaptado à realidade atual, seguindo protocolos estabelecidos pelas autoridades de saúde. Concluiu-se que o PAA pode minimizar as crises sanitária e econômica, principalmente para a população mais vulnerável, apresentando ações que vão ao encontro das demandas da sociedade civil organizada e de recomendações de organismos nacionais e internacionais especializados, visando à redução dos impactos econômicos e sociais da pandemia causada pelo novo coronavírus.","Sambuichi, Regina Helena Rosa; Almeida, Ana Flávia Cordeiro Souza de; Perin, Gabriela; Spínola, Paulo Asafe Campos; Pella, Antônio Fernando Costa",Rev. adm. pública (Online),353,26

This study aimed to determine job-seeking anxiety, resilience quotient and family influence on career decision-making and related factors among senior, undergraduate university students. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted in a university in Southern Thailand;from May to October, 2020. Two hundred and seventy-one participants completed questionnaires regarding personal and parental demographic characteristics, resilience, family influence scale, job-seeking self-perception and job-seeking anxiety. Results: The prevalence of job-seeking anxiety among participants was low (40%), moderate (50%) and high (10%). In univariate analysis, factors significantly associated with job-seeking anxiety were: female gender (p=0.03), effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, economics and the current, political situation Thailand (p=0.03), resilience quotient (p&lt;0.001) and job-seeking self-perception (p&lt;0.001). The predictors of job-seeking anxiety, from multivariate analysis, were: resilience quotient (β = -1.169, P&lt;0.001) and job-seeking self-perception (β = 2.232, P&lt;0.001). Conclusion: Our study provided evidences that a significant proportion of senior, undergraduate students had experienced job-seeking anxiety, with the protective factor of job-seeking anxiety being individual resilience quotient.

The purpose of this study is to report on our management of the handling and delivery of biological medications to patients during periods of lockdown in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). METHODS: A descriptive study conducted at our 380-bed tertiary care hospital. Managing the delivery of the biological medications was organized in six phases: (1) taskforce development, (2) identification of the relevant biological medications, (3) identification of patients, (4) organization of transportation, (5) medication delivery/pickup and (6) locating patients with unidentified addresses. The study was approved by our hospital's Institutional Review Board. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Biological medications were delivered to 1235/1373 (90%) patients. This included 1875/2036 (92%) prescriptions. 900 prescriptions were delivered to 570 patients living in 95 cities and villages across the kingdom. 141 patients received 183 prescribed oral biological medications and 477 patients received 787 prescribed parenteral biological medications delivered with temperature control. 224 parenteral biological medication were delivered by car to 116 patients living in less accessible cities in the west of the country. The car deliveries of parenteral biological medications required particularly careful handling, packaging and temperature control. Delivering biological medications to patients during the curfew was a unique experience. However, the approach we have used ensured safe access to medications under appropriate conditions. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Delivering biological medications to patients during the lockdown was challenging. With the possibility of a second wave of COVID-19, hospitals should have a standardized process in-place for delivering such medications.","Mukhtar, Amnah; Shukry, Murooj; Bannan, Douha",J. clin. pharm. ther,353,27

The goal of this meta-analysis was to summarize the evidence regarding the prognostic relevance of cardiac biomarkers from data available in published reports. PubMed, Embase and Web of Science were searched from inception through April 2020 for studies comparing median values of cardiac biomarkers in critically ill versus non-critically ill COVID-19 patients, or patients who died versus those who survived. The weighted mean differences (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) between the groups were calculated for each study and combined using a random effects meta-analysis model. The odds ratio (OR) for mortality based on cardiac injury was combined from studies reporting it. Troponin levels were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients who died or were critically ill versus those who were alive or not critically ill (WMD 0.57, 95% CI 0.43-0.70, p < 0.001). Additionally, BNP levels were also significantly higher in patients who died or were critically ill (WMD 0.45, 95% CI - 0.21-0.69, p < 0.001). Cardiac injury was independently associated with significantly increased odds of mortality (OR 6.641, 95% CI 1.26-35.1, p = 0.03). A significant difference in levels of D-dimer was seen in those who died or were critically ill. CK levels were only significantly higher in those who died versus those who were alive (WMD 0.79, 95% CI 0.25-1.33, p = 0.004).

It is testimony to the intellectual breadth of Walton’s ideas in argumentation theory and fallacies that his work should find a home in medical and health disciplines, particularly epidemiology and public health. In this paper, I examine three areas of Walton’s theoretical approach to argument and fallacies that I have found most beneficial to my work on reasoning in public health. First, Walton’s collaboration with John Woods resulted in a new, rigorous program of fallacy research. Integral to this new approach to the fallacies was the characterization of non-fallacious variants of most of the major informal fallacies. Second, Walton advocated for a third category of presumptive argument to sit alongside deduction and induction, with plausibility as the standard of rational evaluation. Many so-called informal fallacies, he contended, are rationally warranted presumptive arguments in the practically oriented contexts in which they are advanced. Third, Walton argued that presumptive arguments like the argument from expert opinion can be scrutinized using critical questions during systematic reasoning. They may also bypass critical questions and facilitate a quick leap to a conclusion based on one or two explicit premises during heuristic reasoning. Each of these three areas in Walton’s work is discussed in the context of medicine and health, with illustration provided by the current Covid-19 pandemic. © 2021, College Publications.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a real-life follow-up study assessing the evolution in lung function, chest CT and ventilation distribution between 10 weeks and 6 months after diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS: Seventy-nine patients were assessed at 6 months of whom 63 had chest CT at both follow-up visits and 46 had multiple breath washout testing to obtain lung clearance index (LCI). The study group was divided into a restrictive (n = 39) and a non-restrictive subgroup (n = 40) based on TLC z-score.

Physical inactivity, the world's fourth leading cause of death, may indeed be exacerbated by physical distancing measures, such as sheltering at home and closing or limiting access to recreation and exercise facilities. The purpose of this paper is to urge public health and medical professionals not to forget the importance of physical activity to whole-person health, recognize the importance of physical activity as a potential COVID-19 mitigation strategy and to serve as advocates for promoting active lifestyles.

These responses have been far from being backed scientifically and appear ignorant of India's capabilities of leveraging its strengths to mitigate the impact of the pandemic. Backed by a swift Government action of restricting/regulating movement to increasing public health capacity to meet the increasing demands of the pandemic, India seems to have done enough to emerge successful. India is doing well, if not guaranteed for the future, but at least for now. Here we review these measures and point to their consistency with analysis of the role of intercommunity transmission and within community action to stop localized outbreaks. In particular, severe restrictions on travel, stopping gatherings, targeted localized lockdowns, school closures, effective public communication, improvements in case identification, rapid ramping of industrial production of masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE) and testing capacity, as well as intensive measures in high density areas of urban deprivation have placed India in a regime of declining cases and outbreak control. It is time to recognize the scientific basis of India's success and give it its due.

A critical aspect of fighting this pandemic is to obtain accurate and timely test results so that patients who have tested positive for COVID-19 can be identified and isolated to reduce the spread of the virus. Research has shown that saliva is a promising candidate for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics because its collection is minimally invasive and can be reliably self-administered. However, little research has been conducted on saliva testing and SARS-CoV-2 self-sampling (SARS-CoV-2SS) in Sub-Saharan Africa. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study is to comparatively evaluate the clinical sensitivity and specificity of nasal and oral samples self-collected by individuals for SARS-CoV-2 testing against a reference method involving sample collection and testing by a health care professional. The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate the usability of nasal self-sampling and saliva self-sampling as a sample collection method for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing by using failure mode and error assessment. METHODS: Participants will be recruited from the general population by using various methods, Participants will be screened progressively as they present at the clinical trial sites as well as in primary health care catchment areas in the inner city of Johannesburg, South Africa. In the event that recruitment numbers are low, we will use a mobile van to recruit participants from outlying areas of Johannesburg. We aim to enroll 250 participants into this study in approximately 6 weeks. Two sample types-a self-administered nasal swab and a self-administered saliva sample-will be collected from each participant, and a health care professional will collect a third sample by using a nasopharyngeal swab (ie, the standard reference method). RESULTS: This protocol has been approved by the University of the Witwatersrand Human Research Ethics Committee on July 31, 2020 (Protocol number EzCov003). As of May 13, 2021, 120 participants have been enrolled into the study. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2SS may offer many benefits to individuals, by allowing for initial self-identification of symptoms and collection of samples without involving third parties and potential risk of infection provided the sample can be safely processed via a collection system. The results of this study will provide preliminary data on the acceptability, feasibility, and usability of SARS-CoV-2SS among the general population for its future implementation.

The social distancing policies necessary to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 have involved increased levels of social isolation. This cross-sectional survey study examined pain severity and interference among individuals with chronic pain during an early phase of social distancing mandates, and identified characteristics of individuals who were most impacted. Approximately 4-8 weeks after social distancing mandates commenced in the state of Massachusetts, 150 patients with fibromyalgia, chronic spine and postsurgical pain completed demographic, pain, social distancing, and validated psychosocial questionnaires. Patients self-reported an overall significant increase in pain severity and pain interference, compared to before social distancing, although both pain severity and interference were quite variable among individuals under conditions of social distancing. Several demographic, socioeconomic, and psychosocial factors were associated with greater pain severity and interference during social distancing. Multivariable linear regression demonstrated that female gender, non-white race, lower education, disability, fibromyalgia, and higher pain catastrophizing were independently associated with greater pain severity, while female gender and pain catastrophizing were independently associated greater pain interference. The findings suggest that individual differences among chronic pain patients should be considered in the planning, development, and prioritization of interventions to improve pain care and to prevent worsening of symptoms during the continuing COVID-19 pandemic.","Hruschak, Valerie; Flowers, K Mikayla; Azizoddin, Desiree R; Jamison, Robert N; Edwards, Robert R; Schreiber, Kristin L",Pain,353,20

Therefore, we aimed to investigate the decline in ambulatory presentations for vascular events (stroke, transient ischemic attack [TIA], and myocardial infarction [MI]) during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Patients with a diagnosis of ischemic stroke, TIA, or MI documented anonymously in 1,262 general practices in Germany were included. We studied the differences between 2019 and 2020 (between April and June) in terms of rates and baseline characteristics by comparing monthly absolute frequencies. RESULTS: A total of 3,496 patients with stroke (mean age: 72.2 years), 1,608 patients with TIA (mean age: 71.5 years), and 2,385 patients with MI (mean age: 66.8 years) were identified between April and June 2020, indicating a decrease of 10% (stroke), 16% (TIA), and 9% (MI) compared to 2019. For patients with stroke, the decrease in men was 13% (women: -6%) but reached 17% in the age category 51-60 years. For MI, the decrease was only obvious in males (14%). The largest decrease in stroke (-17%) and MI (-19%) was noted in April, while that for TIA occurred in May (-22%). In June for all 3 conditions, the previous year's level was achieved. Only in TIA, the age differs between 2019 and 2020 (mean age: 69.9 vs. 71.5 years; p < 0.05). In patients with stroke and MI, the proportions of men were lower in 2019 than in 2020 (stroke: 54.8-50.5%, p < 0.05 and MI: 64-60.2%, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Although the decline in the number of patients presenting with stroke, TIA, and MI was not as noticeable in the ambulatory sector as it was in the area of emergency hospital-based care, our data indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic affected all sectors within the medical care system.","Tanislav, Christian; Jacob, Louis; Kostev, Karel",Neuroepidemiology,353,9

METHODS: Clinical assessment of symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in an initial case series of four families and confirmatory case series of seven families, within which one family member developed coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) and exposed another family member receiving methotrexate treatment; experimental part with methotrexate treatment of mice and organoids followed by the assessment of mRNA and protein expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2. RESULTS: In the initial case series, three of four women on a joint ski trip developed COVID-19, while the fourth woman, under treatment with methotrexate, remained virus-free. Two of the three diseased women infected their husbands, while the third husband treated with methotrexate remained virus-free. In addition, 7 other families were identified in a follow-up case series, in which one member developed COVID-19, while the other, receiving methotrexate, remained healthy. Experimentally, when mice were treated with methotrexate, ACE2 expression significantly decreased in the lung, in the intestinal epithelium, and in intestinal organoids. CONCLUSION: These clinical and experimental data indicate that methotrexate has certain protective effects on SARS-CoV-2 infection via downregulating ACE2.","Schälter, Fabian; Dürholz, Kerstin; Bucci, Laura; Burmester, Gerd; Caporali, Roberto; Figuereido, Camille; Cobra, Jaime Fogagnolo; Manger, Bernhard; Zaiss, Mario M; Schett, Georg",Arthritis Res Ther,353,16

During this unique period, many water utilities have been forced to operate outside of design conditions with reduced workforce and financial capacities. Few studies have examined how water utilities respond to a pandemic;such methods are even absent from many emergency response plans. Here, we documented how utilities have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a qualitative analysis of 30 interviews with 53 practitioners spanning 28 U.S. water utilities. Our aim was to, first, understand the challenges experienced by utilities and changes to operations (e.g., demand and deficit accounts) and, second, to document utilities' responses. Results showed that to maintain service continuity and implement SDPs, utilities had to overcome various challenges. These include supply chain issues, spatiotemporal changes in demand, and financial losses, and these challenges were largely dependent on the type of customers served (e.g., commercial or residential). Examples of utilities' responses include proactively ordering extra supplies and postponing capital projects. Although utilities' adaptations ensured the immediate provision of water services, their responses might have negative repercussions in the future (e.g., delayed projects contributing to aging infrastructure).","Spearing, L.

It is critical to understand how the predictive value of the test varies with time from exposure and symptom onset to avoid being falsely reassured by negative test results. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the false-negative rate by day since infection. DESIGN: Literature review and pooled analysis. SETTING: 7 previously published studies providing data on RT-PCR performance by time since symptom onset or SARS-CoV-2 exposure using samples from the upper respiratory tract (n = 1330). PATIENTS: A mix of inpatients and outpatients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. MEASUREMENTS: A Bayesian hierarchical model was fitted to estimate the false-negative rate by day since exposure and symptom onset. RESULTS: Over the 4 days of infection before the typical time of symptom onset (day 5), the probability of a false-negative result in an infected person decreases from 100% (95% CI, 100% to 100%) on day 1 to 67% (CI, 27% to 94%) on day 4. On the day of symptom onset, the median false-negative rate was 38% (CI, 18% to 65%). This decreased to 20% (CI, 12% to 30%) on day 8 (3 days after symptom onset) then began to increase again, from 21% (CI, 13% to 31%) on day 9 to 66% (CI, 54% to 77%) on day 21. LIMITATION: Imprecise estimates due to heterogeneity in the design of studies on which results were based. CONCLUSION: Care must be taken in interpreting RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection-particularly early in the course of infection-when using these results as a basis for removing precautions intended to prevent onward transmission. If clinical suspicion is high, infection should not be ruled out on the basis of RT-PCR alone, and the clinical and epidemiologic situation should be carefully considered.

For many cancer types, treatment paradigms have changed, as immunotherapy is increasingly being integrated into frontline standard-of-care treatments and producing meaningful and prolonged responses. This has inspired an avalanche of clinical trials studying ICIs in all types of malignancies, including gynecological cancers. Ovarian and endometrial cancers are characterized by DNA damage repair defects, either via disruption of the homologous recombination DNA repair mechanism in the former or via defects in the mismatch repair (MMR) pathway in the latter, which lead to a high load of neoantigens in both. Cervical cancer is dependent on the expression of human papillomavirus (HPV) proteins, which induce an immune response. Regardless, clinical trials testing ICIs in gynecological malignancies have initially led to disappointing results. Despite durable responses in some patients, overall response rates have been dismal. Nevertheless, in recent years, with the development of better predictive tumor biomarkers, such as microsatellite instability for endometrial cancer and programmed death ligand 1 for cervical cancer, ICIs have found their way into routine treatments for patients with advanced-stage disease. ICI-based combinations, although adding toxicity, have further improved response rates, and new combinations are currently being tested in clinical trials, as are other immunotherapy modalities, such as adoptive cell transfer and HPV-based vaccines. This review summarizes current clinical evidence supporting the use of immunotherapy in gynecological malignancies and describes studies in progress, with a focus on ICIs and predictive response biomarkers.","Taha, Tarek; Reiss, Ari; Amit, Amnon; Perets, Ruth",BioDrugs,353,24

The main objective of the article is to examine whether the Covid-19 crisis experience and outcome of sample countries are related to their leaders? behaviour and actions. Based on leaders? orientation towards certain action motives and action and leadership styles, the article classifies the leaders? action and leadership styles. The article finds that the leaders with a ?missionary? action style displayed positive leadership styles and generally had the best Covid-19 outcomes, while those with a ?gamer? action style were associated with negative leadership styles and poorer outcomes, with those with ?political? and ?strategist? action styles falling in between. To validate the impact of evolving leader behaviour on Covid-19 outcomes, the article evaluates the average daily growth of Covid-19 cases in the subsequent (post-analysis) seven weeks and tests the mean differences between different style groups. The tests indicate a significant difference in the outcomes between different style groups except between ?gamers? and ?strategists?. The difference is more pronounced when the BRI[.]S countries (i.e., BRICS minus China) in various combinations are excluded from the test. A similar conclusion arises for the negatively and positively oriented leadership styles. Thus, while finding a relationship of leadership behaviour with Covid-19 outcomes, the article also provides a reason to suspect the role of socio-economic and institutional factors in clouding or confounding the leadership effect in view of the distinctive behaviour of OECD and the large emerging countries.","Rameshan, Pallikara",IIM Kozhikode Society &amp; Management Review,353,26

Mourning the death of friends or loved ones due to COVID-19 was the main risk factor for depression (OR = 2.2, 95%CI 1.8-2.7, p &#8804; 0.0001), and personal COVID-19 status was the main risk factor for PTSD (OR = 2.2, 95%CI 1.7-2.9, p &#8804; 0.0001). CONCLUSION: The most frequent mental health problems during the common exposure scenario for COVID-19 in Mexico included the short-term psychological consequences of intense adversity. A comprehensive strategy for preventing mental health problems should focus on individuals with cumulative vulnerability and specific risk factors.","Robles, Rebeca; Rodríguez, Evelyn; Vega-Ramírez, Hamid; Álvarez-Icaza, Dení; Madrigal, Eduardo; Durand, Sol; Morales-Chainé, Silvia; Astudillo, Claudia; Real-Ramírez, Janet; Medina-Mora, María-Elena; Becerra, Claudia; Escamilla, Raúl; Alcocer-Castillejos, Natasha; Ascencio, Leticia; Díaz, Dulce; González, Hugo; Barrón-Velázquez, Evalinda; Fresán, Ana; Rodríguez-Bores, Lorena; Quijada-Gaytán, Juan-Manuel; Zabicky, Gady; Tejadilla-Orozco, Diana; González-Olvera, Jorge-Julio; Reyes-Terán, Gustavo",,353,16

Local studies showed that hospital pharmacy is the most preferred sector, while community pharmacy is the least preferred. However, jobs in hospital pharmacy are limited compared to community pharmacy. Hence, to accommodate the increasing numbers of pharmacy graduates and to facilitate the implementation of Saudi Vision 2030, which promotes primary healthcare and the participation of both private and non-governmental organisations in healthcare delivery, community pharmacy ought to be Saudised. This study was conducted to assess the career choices made by Saudi pharmacy students and the enablers that influence their career choice, especially in community pharmacy. METHODS: A prospective cross-sectional approach was used. A total of 437 final year pharmacy students were recruited from 15 pharmacy schools around the country. RESULTS: Salary and advancement opportunities as well as geographical location, benefits, and work environment were found to be ""very important"" enablers when making career decisions. Hospital pharmacy was selected as the most preferred sector by 242 (55.4%) of the participants, while community pharmacy was the least favoured pharmacy sector (17% or 6.2%). The enablers that might influence the consideration of a job in community pharmacy included career aspiration and social accountability. On the other hand, the barriers were personal beliefs about the sector and the nature of the work. CONCLUSIONS: The community pharmacy sector was found to be the least preferred sector to work in. The study revealed a list of enablers that the participants found to be relevant or of high relevance when choosing community pharmacy as a career pathway. Some of the enablers contribute to the role of the pharmacist towards the local community, social accountability, and towards the country's Vision, such as interaction with the general public and educating them. Other enablers are related to the pharmacists' career aspirations, such as owning a business. Some of the barriers that were found relevant include high workload, inflexible working hours, and limited opportunities for professional development. Localisation of community pharmacies would help to create more jobs for national pharmacists, increase the participation of female pharmacists in the workforce and support the achievement of Vision 2030. The barriers should be tackled on several levels: undergraduate curriculum, regulatory, and actual practice. Undergraduate education needs to include primary pharmaceutical care services in its curriculum. Regulatory changes include enforcing the renationalisation of the community pharmacy sector and permitting females to work in community pharmacies without location restrictions.","Almaghaslah, Dalia; Alsayari, Abdulrhman; Almanasef, Mona; Asiri, Amjad",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),353,16

However, these approaches have been typically optimized for a specific function or environment and do not have the flexibility that many real organisms exhibit to thrive in complex microenvironments. Here, inspired by adaptable microbes and using a combination of experiment and simulation, we demonstrate that one-dimensional colloidal chains can fold into geometrically complex morphologies, including helices, plectonemes, lassos, and coils, and translate via multiple mechanisms that can be varied with applied magnetic field. With chains of multiblock asymmetry, the propulsion mode can be switched from bulk to surface-enabled, mimicking the swimming of microorganisms such as flagella-rotating bacteria and tail-whipping sperm and the surface-enabled motion of arching and stretching inchworms and sidewinding snakes. We also demonstrate that reconfigurability enables navigation through three-dimensional and narrow channels simulating capillary blood vessels. Our results show that flexible microdevices based on simple chains can transform both shape and motility under varying magnetic fields, a capability we expect will be particularly beneficial in complex in vivo microenvironments.","Yang, Tao; Sprinkle, Brennan; Guo, Yang; Qian, Jun; Hua, Daoben; Donev, Aleksandar; Marr, David W M; Wu, Ning",Proc.

The country's borders were closed on March 23, and the lockdown of cities was also implemented. The unanticipated disruption of scholarly or professional advancement for the 94% of university students who are not currently learning may increase the burden of mental illness among these students and predispose them to social vices. Two suicide deaths occurred during the lockdown. Poverty, lack of trust in the government, ignorance, denial and misplaced religious zealotry negatively impact on the behavior of Nigerians. Fear-induced behavioral changes such as consuming lemon, ginger, garlic, local herbs, and other substances for protection have also become rampant. Loss of income due to the lockdown and the accompanying destitution can also be a pathfinder for numerous other sicknesses and deaths. For the benefit of enhanced prevention and control of infection, only government-funded hospitals and a few designated privately owned hospitals have been permitted to provide continued services at this time. The number of shifts in these hospitals were adjusted such that there are fewer health care professionals in the hospital at a given time. This strategy has inhibited treatment and care for certain groups of people who are not COVID-19 patients.

The timing of oxygen therapy was considered to have a great influence on the symptomatic relief of hypoxemia and seeking medical intervention, especially in situations with insufficient medical resources, but the evidence on the timing of oxygen therapy is limited. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Medical charts review was carried out to collect the data of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection confirmed in Tongji hospital, Wuhan from 30th December 2019 to 8th March 2020. In this study, the appropriate timing of oxygen therapy and risk factors associated with severe and fatal illness were identified and the effectiveness of antivirus on disease progression was assessed. Among 1362 patients, the prevalence of hypoxia symptoms was significantly higher in those patients with severe and fatal illness than in those with less severe disease. The onset of hypoxia symptoms was most common in the second to third week after symptom onset, and patients with critical and fatal illness experienced these symptoms earlier than those with mild and severe illness. In multivariable analyses, the risk of death increased significantly when oxygen therapy was started more than 2 days after hypoxia symptoms onset among critical patients (OR, 1.92; 95%CI, 1.20 to 3.10). Compared to the critically ill patients without IFN-a, the patients who were treated with IFN-a had a lower mortality (OR, 0.60; 95%CI, 0.39 to 0.91). CONCLUSIONS: Early initiation of oxygen therapy was associated with lower mortality among critical patients. This study highlighted the importance of early oxygen therapy after the onset of hypoxia symptoms. Our results also lend support to potentially beneficial effects of IFN&#945; on critical illness.","Long, Lu; Wu, Liang; Chen, Lang; Zhou, Daixing; Wu, Hongyu; Lu, Donghao; Li, Honglin; Duan, Xiaoxia; Han, Yutong; Li, Xianzhi; Wang, Qiuxia; Zhang, Jing",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,353,33

All patients received systemic high dose steroid therapy within one month after onset. The difference between the threshold levels measured by ASSR and PTA on the same day [ASSR - PTA] was calculated. The hearing recovery (HR) was defined as a < 30 dB HL of final degree of hearing loss and a > 15 dB HL of hearing gain. RESULTS: The HR (+) group showed significantly worse ASSR predicted threshold than pure-tone threshold in univariate (t(51) = 2.412, p = .020) and multivariate analysis (OR 0.910, p = .012). The [ASSR - PTA] threshold showed significantly moderate correlation with hearing gain (r = -0.303, p = .028). CONCLUSIONS: Worse ASSR predicted threshold than pure-tone threshold predicted poor hearing outcome after systemic steroid treatment in mild to severe unilateral SSNHL.","Ahn, Jung Hyun; Choi, Ji Eun",Acta Otolaryngol,353,16

We aim to provide guidance to radiologists in reporting CT findings potentially attributable to COVID-19 pneumonia, including standardized language to reduce reporting variability when addressing the possibility of COVID-19. When typical or indeterminate features of COVID-19 pneumonia are present in endemic areas as an incidental finding, we recommend contacting the referring providers to discuss the likelihood of viral infection. These incidental findings do not necessarily need to be reported as COVID-19 pneumonia. In this setting, using the term ""viral pneumonia"" can be a reasonable and inclusive alternative. However, if one opts to use the term ""COVID-19"" in the incidental setting, consider the provided standardized reporting language.

Based on the prompt increase of human infection rate, COVID-19 outbreak was distinguished as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). By 2020, COVID-19 becomes a major health problem all around the world. Due to the battle against COVID-19, there are some adversities that are encountered with. The most significant difficulty is the lack of equipment for the COVID-19 battle. Lately, there is not sufficient personal protective equipment (PPE) for hospital workers on the front lines in this terrifying time. All around the world, hospitals are overwhelmed by the volume of patients and the lack of personal protective equipment including face masks, gloves, eye protection and clothing. In addition, the lack of nasal swabs, which are necessary components, that are used for testing is another issue that is being faced. There are a small number of respirators, which are emergency devices that help patients breathe for a short period of time. To overcome the limited number of equipment available, the foremost solution can be 3D printing that allows three-dimensional renderings to be realized as physical objects with the use of a printer and that revolutionized prototyping. Low-cost desktop 3D printers allow economical 3D models and guides but have less quality approvals. 3D printing is already well integrated into the process of COVID-19 battle by manufacturing the equipment that are convenient.

Authors' reply,18.78991,9.956893,2021,"SARS-CoV-2 infections elicit both humoral and cellular immune responses. For the prevention and treatment of COVID19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, T cell responses are important in mediating recovery and immune-protection. The identification of immunogenic epitopes that can elicit a meaningful T cell response can be elusive. Traditionally, this has been achieved using sophisticated in silico methods to predict putative epitopes; however, our previous studies find that immunodominant SARS-CoV-2 peptides defined by such in silico methods often fail to elicit T cell responses recognizing SARS-CoV-2. We postulated that immunogenic epitopes for SARS-CoV-2 are best defined by directly analyzing peptides eluted from the peptide-MHC complex and then validating immunogenicity empirically by determining if such peptides can elicit T cells recognizing SARS-CoV-2 antigen-expressing cells. Using a tandem mass spectrometry approach, we identified epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 derived not only from structural but also non-structural genes in regions highly conserved among SARS-CoV-2 strains including recently recognized variants. We report here, for the first time, several novel SARS-CoV-2 epitopes from membrane glycol-protein (MGP) and non-structure protein-13 (NSP13) defined by mass-spectrometric analysis of MHC-eluted peptides, provide empiric evidence for their immunogenicity to induce T cell response. Significance StatementCurrent state of the art uses putative epitope peptides based on in silico prediction algorithms to evaluate the T cell response among COVID-19 patients. However, none of these peptides have been tested for immunogenicity, i.e. the ability to elicit a T cell response capable of recognizing endogenously presented peptide. In this study, we used MHC immune-precipitation, acid elution and tandem mass spectrometry to define the SARS-CoV-2 immunopeptidome for membrane glycol-protein and the non-structural protein. Furthermore, taking advantage of a highly robust endogenous T cell (ETC) workflow, we verify the immunogenicity of these MS-defined peptides by in vitro generation of MGP and NSP13 peptide-specific T cells and confirm T cell recognition of MGP or NSP13 endogenously expressing cell lines.","Pan, Ke; Chiu, Yulun; Huang, Eric; Chen, Michelle; Wang, Junmei; Lai, Ivy; Singh, Shailbala; Shaw, Rebecca; MacCoss, Michael J.; Yee, Cassian",,353,21

However, less is known about the cardiac involvement as a complication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Objective: To describe the presentation of acute myocardial inflammation in a patient with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who recovered from the influenzalike syndrome and developed fatigue and signs and symptoms of heart failure a week after upper respiratory tract symptoms. Design, Setting, and Participant: This case report describes an otherwise healthy 53-year-old woman who tested positive for COVID-19 and was admitted to the cardiac care unit in March 2020 for acute myopericarditis with systolic dysfunction, confirmed on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, the week after onset of fever and dry cough due to COVID-19. The patient did not show any respiratory involvement during the clinical course. Exposure: Cardiac involvement with COVID-19. Main Outcomes and Measures: Detection of cardiac involvement with an increase in levels of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and high-sensitivity troponin T, echocardiography changes, and diffuse biventricular myocardial edema and late gadolinium enhancement on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Results: An otherwise healthy 53-year-old white woman presented to the emergency department with severe fatigue. She described fever and dry cough the week before. She was afebrile but hypotensive; electrocardiography showed diffuse ST elevation, and elevated high-sensitivity troponin T and NT-proBNP levels were detected. Findings on chest radiography were normal. There was no evidence of obstructive coronary disease on coronary angiography. Based on the COVID-19 outbreak, a nasopharyngeal swab was performed, with a positive result for SARS-CoV-2 on real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed increased wall thickness with diffuse biventricular hypokinesis, especially in the apical segments, and severe left ventricular dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction of 35%). Short tau inversion recovery and T2-mapping sequences showed marked biventricular myocardial interstitial edema, and there was also diffuse late gadolinium enhancement involving the entire biventricular wall. There was a circumferential pericardial effusion that was most notable around the right cardiac chambers. These findings were all consistent with acute myopericarditis. She was treated with dobutamine, antiviral drugs (lopinavir/ritonavir), steroids, chloroquine, and medical treatment for heart failure, with progressive clinical and instrumental stabilization.

Worldwide concerted effort to identify viral genomic changes across different sub-types has identified several strong changes in the coding region. However, there have not been many studies focusing on the variations in the 5' and 3' untranslated regions and their consequences. Considering the possible importance of these regions in host mediated regulation of viral RNA genome, we wanted to explore the phenomenon. METHODS: To have an idea of the global changes in 5' and 3'-UTR sequences, we downloaded 8595 complete and high-coverage SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence information from human host in FASTA format from Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) from 15 different geographical regions. Next, we aligned them using Clustal Omega software and investigated the UTR variants. We also looked at the putative host RNA binding protein (RBP) and microRNA binding sites in these regions by 'RBPmap' and 'RNA22 v2' respectively. Expression status of selected RBPs and microRNAs were checked in lungs tissue. RESULTS: We identified 28 unique variants in SARS-CoV-2 UTR region based on a minimum variant percentage cut-off of 0.5. Along with 241C>T change the important 5'-UTR change identified was 187A>G, while 29734G>C, 29742G>A/T and 29774C>T were the most familiar variants of 3'UTR among most of the continents. Furthermore, we found that despite the variations in the UTR regions, binding of host RBP to them remains mostly unaltered, which further influenced the functioning of specific miRNAs. CONCLUSION: Our results, shows for the first time in SARS-Cov-2 infection, a possible cross-talk between host RBPs-miRNAs and viral UTR variants, which ultimately could explain the mechanism of escaping host RNA decay machinery by the virus. The knowledge might be helpful in developing anti-viral compounds in future.","Mukherjee, Moumita; Goswami, Srikanta",PLoS One,353,16

We describe a local experience in providing care for patients with AL amyloidosis and IDD. METHOD: Patient treatment and disease status since the beginning of the pandemic on March 11, 2020, as declared by WHO, were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Ninety-six patients with AL amyloidosis and IDD were included. Four patients with IDD and 22 patients with systemic AL amyloidosis were receiving treatment during the pandemic. Since the pandemic, patients' treatments were discontinued if they achieved VGPR or better postinduction. Seven patients discontinued all treatment after achieving VGPR, and others required treatment modifications. 28 patients have been tested for COVID-19, and all tests have been negative. Three patients died since the pandemic, two from organ complications of systemic AL amyloidosis and one from an unrelated cause.

A retrospective analysis was performed on 217 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the First Hospital of Changsha in China, from January 17, 2020, to February 29, 2020. The active monitoring model in CHPS was used to detect ADR signals of the hospital information system. The risk factors for the ADRs were classified using the World Health Organization-Uppsala Monitoring Centre (WHO-UMC) system. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were carried out to analyze the risk factors of ADRs. Our results showed that the prevalence of ADRs was 37.8% in the patients, which was predominated by drug-induced gastrointestinal disorders and liver system disorders (23.0% vs. 13.8%). The ADR could be explained by the use of lopinavir/ ritonavir and umifenovir by 63.8% and 18.1%, respectively. There were 96.8% of ADRs that occurred within 14 days of hospitalization. Multivariable analysis showed that length of stay (odds ratio (OR): 2.02; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03-3.96; P = 0.04), number of drugs used in the hospital (OR: 3.17; 95% CI 1.60-6.27; P = 0.001) and underlying basic diseases (OR: 2.07; 95% CI 1.02-4.23; P = 0.04) were independent risk factor for ADRs in the patients. Together, the incidence of ADRs was significantly high during the treatment period. Moreover, the active monitoring of the CHPS system reflected ADRs during COVID-19 treatment in the real world, which provided reference for safe medication in the clinic.","Sun, Ji; Deng, Xuanyu; Chen, Xiaoping; Huang, Juanjuan; Huang, Siqiong; Li, Yanfei; Feng, Jinhui; Liu, Jiyang; He, Gefei",Clin Pharmacol Ther,353,24

METHODS: With both assays, we analyzed 3033 serum samples collected from 2496 patients without COVID-19 vaccination. In addition, we studied 34 healthcare-workers who received two injections of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine from BioNTech/Pfizer three weeks apart and who had repeatedly determined their antibody response by both assays. RESULTS: In our cohort of patients without COVID-19 vaccination, 62.9% of all determinations were negative with both Roche assays and 31.5% were positive with both assays. In 5.6% of our cohort, however, there were discordant results with both assays (partly because initially discordant results of the two assays became concordantly positive over time). In the healthcare-workers with the COVID-19 vaccination, the results of the Roche anti-nucleocapsid assay remained negative throughout the observation period of 5 weeks after vaccination. The initially negative antibodies against the spike protein became positive with the Roche assay in all samples two weeks after the initial injection, and the serum concentrations of anti-spike antibodies increased constantly until 4-5 weeks after the initial injection. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we provide information on serological testing with the two Roche assays, which may be important for the application of the two assays in clinical routine. There are differences in the pattern of antibodies in individuals with and without COVID-19 vaccination.","Mueller, Thomas",Clin Chim Acta,353,16

We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the BioNTech-Pfizer (BNT162b2) vaccine to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe outcomes in octo- and novo-generians in a German state setting. Methods and FindingsA prospective observational study of 708,187 persons aged [≥]80 years living in Bavaria, Germany, was conducted between Jan 9 to Apr 11, 2021. We assessed the vaccine efficacy (VE) for two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine with respect to SARS-CoV-2 infection and related hospitalisations and mortality. Additionally, differences in VE by age groups [≥]80 to [≤]89 years and [≥]90 years were studied. Analyses were adjusted by sex. By the end of follow-up, 63.8% of the Bavarian population [≥]80 years had received one dose, and 52.7% two doses, of the BNT162b2 vaccine. Two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine lowered the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections and related outcomes, resulting in VE estimates of 68.3% (95% confidence interval (CI) 65.5%, 70.9%) for infection, 73.2% (95% CI 65.3%, 79.3%) for hospitalisation, and 80.1% (95% CI 80.0%, 89.0%) for mortality.

There have been no published studies attempting to reduce DNA rates in breast clinics. We aimed to assess the impact of contacting patients prior to clinic attendance and Short Message Service (SMS) reminder on DNA rates in rapid access new patient breast clinics, evaluate 'Could Not Attend' (CNA) rate, and explore any correlation between age, sex, clinic days and sessions. METHODS: Initially, DNAs at the rapid access new patient breast clinic between 01/04/2018 and 31/03/2019 at a district general hospital in the North-West of England was assessed (Cycle 1). Changes were introduced in terms of contacting patients prior to offering appointments, followed by SMS reminders nearer the clinic dates. Subsequently, DNA was reassessed between 01/10/2019 and 31/03/2020 (Cycle 2). RESULTS: Following implementation of changes, DNA rate reduced from 8.2 to 4.1% (p < 0.00001). CNA rates were 0.9% (Cycle 1) and 1.1% (Cycle 2) [p = 0.36]. Evening clinics had the lowest DNA rates throughout. DNA patients in cycle 2 were significantly older than those in cycle 1 (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Contacting patients prior to clinic appointments and sending SMS reminders helped reduce DNA rates significantly in rapid access new patient breast clinics. Scheduling clinic sessions with least DNA rates, such as evening clinics, should be contemplated. One should be cautious of mobile phone technology that conveys SMS, which can potentially disadvantage the older age group. This model could be considered across the board to improve DNA rates.","Kiruparan, Pasupathy; Kiruparan, Nanthesh; Debnath, Debasish",BMC Health Serv Res,353,1

In this context, we must guarantee the provision of acute stroke care and optimise code stroke protocols to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and rationalise the use of hospital resources. The Madrid Stroke multidisciplinary group presents a series of recommendations to achieve these goals. METHODS: We conducted a non-systematic literature search using the keywords ""stroke"" and ""COVID-19"" or ""coronavirus"" or ""SARS-CoV-2."" Our literature review also included other relevant studies known to the authors. Based on this literature review, a series of consensus recommendations were established by the Madrid Stroke multidisciplinary group and its neurology committee. RESULTS: These recommendations address 5 main objectives: 1) coordination of action protocols to ensure access to hospital care for stroke patients; 2) recognition of potentially COVID-19-positive stroke patients; 3) organisation of patient management to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare professionals; 4) avoidance of unnecessary neuroimaging studies and other procedures that may increase the risk of infection; and 5) safe, early discharge and follow-up to ensure bed availability. This management protocol has been called CORONA (Coordinate, Recognise, Organise, Neuroimaging, At home). CONCLUSIONS: The recommendations presented here may assist in the organisation of acute stroke care and the optimisation of healthcare resources, while ensuring the safety of healthcare professionals.","Rodríguez-Pardo, J; Fuentes, B; Alonso de Leciñana, M; Campollo, J; Calleja Castaño, P; Carneado Ruiz, J; Egido Herrero, J; García Leal, R; Gil Núñez, A; Gómez Cerezo, J F; Martín Martínez, A; Masjuán Vallejo, J; Palomino Aguado, B; Riera López, N; Simón de Las Heras, R; Vivancos Mora, J; Díez Tejedor, E",Neurologia,353,20

We observed the co-circulation of multiple SARS-CoV-2 lineages over time, which were linked to multiple importations and characterized by large transmission clusters concomitant with a high number of infections. Subsequent implementation of a three-phase nationwide lockdown strategy greatly reduced infection numbers and hospitalizations. Yet we present evidence of sustained viral spread among sporadic clusters acting as ""hidden reservoirs"" during summer 2020. Mathematical modelling shows that increased mobility among residents eventually catalyzed the coalescence of such clusters, thus driving up the number of infections and initiating a new epidemic wave. Our results suggest that the efficacy of public health interventions is, ultimately, limited by the size and structure of epidemic reservoirs, which may warrant prioritization during vaccine deployment.","Giovanetti, Marta; Cella, Eleonora; Benedetti, Francesca; Rife Magalis, Brittany; Fonseca, Vagner; Fabris, Silvia; Campisi, Giovanni; Ciccozzi, Alessandra; Angeletti, Silvia; Borsetti, Alessandra; Tambone, Vittoradolfo; Sagnelli, Caterina; Pascarella, Stefano; Riva, Alberto; Ceccarelli, Giancarlo; Marcello, Alessandro; Azarian, Taj; Wilkinson, Eduan; de Oliveira, Tulio; Alcantara, Luiz Carlos Junior; Cauda, Roberto; Caruso, Arnaldo; Dean, Natalie E; Browne, Cameron; Lourenco, Jose; Salemi, Marco; Zella, Davide; Ciccozzi, Massimo",Commun Biol,353,15

However, conventional network embedding models are developed for static structures, commonly consider nodes only and they are seriously challenged when the network is varying in time. Temporal networks may provide an advantage in the description of real systems, but they code more complex information, which could be effectively represented only by a handful of methods so far. Here, we propose a new method of event embedding of temporal networks, called weg2vec, which builds on temporal and structural similarities of events to learn a low dimensional representation of a temporal network. This projection successfully captures latent structures and similarities between events involving different nodes at different times and provides ways to predict the final outcome of spreading processes unfolding on the temporal structure.","Torricelli, Maddalena; Karsai, Márton; Gauvin, Laetitia",Sci Rep,353,20

Despite recent reports of ubiquitous invertebrate decline, the ecosystem consequences have been rarely documented. We exposed standardized plant communities grown in the iDiv Ecotron to different levels of invertebrate numbers and biomass and tracked effects on the diversity and composition of bacterial communities associated with flowers and leaves of Scorzoneroides autumnalis and Trifolium pratense using next-generation 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Our data indicate that invertebrate decline reduces bacterial richness and $\beta $-diversity and alters community composition. These effects may result from direct effects of invertebrates that may serve as dispersal agents of bacteria; or from indirect effects where animal-induced changes in the plant's phenotype shape the niches plants provide for bacterial colonizers. Because bacteria are usually not dispersal limited and because species sorting, i.e. niche-based processes, has been shown to be a dominant process in bacterial community assembly, indirect effects may be more likely. Given that a healthy microbiome is of fundamental importance for the wellbeing of plant, animals (including humans), and ecosystems, a loss of bacterial diversity may be a dramatic yet previously unknown consequence of current invertebrate decline.","Junker, Robert R; Eisenhauer, Nico; Schmidt, Anja; Türke, Manfred",FEMS microbiol. ecol,353,16

In this work we focus on the evolution of the COVID-19 in one of the most populous Brazilian states, namely the Rio de Janeiro state. The first case was reported in March 5, 2020, thus we have a considerable amount of available data to make a good analysis. We study the dynamics of COVID-19 through a Susceptible-Infectious-Quarantined-Recovered (SIQR) model with an additional mechanism that represents the implementation of public policies of social isolation. Based on the data collected from the Rio de Janeiro state Department of Health from March 5, 2020 through April 26, 2020, we observed that the implementation of social distancing policies changed the initial exponential growth to a sub-exponential one. The SIQR model with the above-mentioned mechanism is capable of reproducing the data of confirmed cases in Rio de Janeiro, and it explains how that change occurred. The model also predicts an important mitigation effect, namely the flattening effect, i.e., the considerably decrease of the maximum number of confirmed cases. Through the results of the model, this effect can be directly related to the social isolation policies. Finally, we consider the relaxation of such policies, and discuss about the ideal period of time to release people to return to their activities.","Crokidakis, Nuno",Chaos Solitons Fractals,353,1

We previously showed that systemic inflammation induces an accumulation of B cells in the spleen in a CCR6/CCL20-dependent manner. In this study, we evaluated the role of CCR6/CCL20 in the context of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) protein-induced (B cell-dependent) experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We found that CCR6 is upregulated on murine B cells that migrate into the CNS during neuroinflammation. In addition, human B cells that migrate across CNS endothelium in vitro were found to be CCR6+, and we detected CCL20 production by activated CNS-derived human endothelial cells as well as a systemic increase in CCL20 protein during EAE. Although mice that lack CCR6 expression specifically on B cells exhibited an altered germinal center reaction in response to MOG protein immunization, CCR6-deficient B cells did not exhibit any competitive disadvantage in their migration to the CNS during EAE, and the clinical and pathological presentation of EAE induced by MOG protein was unaffected. These data, to our knowledge, provide new information on the role of B cell-intrinsic CCR6 expression in a B cell-dependent model of neuroinflammation.","Lee, Dennis S W; Yam, Jennifer Y; Grasmuck, Camille; Dasoveanu, Dragos; Michel, Laure; Ward, Lesley A; Rojas, Olga L; Zandee, Stephanie; Bourbonnière, Lyne; Ramaglia, Valeria; Bar-Or, Amit; Prat, Alexandre; Gommerman, Jennifer L",J. immunol,353,22

Social touch is a common and mutual way of expressing affection, care, and intimacy. From an evolutionary perspective, affiliative and affectionate touch are considered necessary for social and cognitive development throughout life-stages and across species. The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic as a public health threat has mandated social distancing as a measure to contain the global outbreak. Travel restrictions, lockdown, and quarantine have led to separation and segregation, giving rise to social touch deprivation that might have adverse biopsychosocial consequences. METHODS: Affective touch has rarely been discussed within the purview of social psychiatry. We attempted to review the neurobiological, social, and behavioural correlates of social and sexual touch, as well as the neurophysiological models involved. RESULTS: The unmyelinated peripheral C-fibre afferents projecting to insular cortex and somatosensory areas form the prime pathway for affective touch. 'Top-down' modulation via the periaqueductal grey area, rostroventral medulla and sub-cortical structures, and 'Bottom-up' approach via the dorsal horn of the spine form the two theoretical models of 'social touch' system. The mu - opioid receptor (MOR) implicated in the Brain Opioid Theory of Social Attachment (BOTSA) and social neuropeptides like oxytocin and vasopressin are the primary neurochemical substrates involved. Sexual intimacy involves other neurotransmitters, with increased oxytocin activity in the limbic structures, Nucleus Accumbens, Anterior Cingulate, and Prefrontal Cortex. The discrimination and amalgamation of touch senses, their affiliative value and emotional valence in humans are based on a complex interplay between psychobiological, environmental, and personal factors. CONCLUSION: The neurobehavioral and emotional effects of 'touch hunger' and strategies to mitigate it during COVID-19 are discussed in the context of psychoneuroimmunity and stress.","Banerjee, Debanjan; Vasquez, Velmarini; Pecchio, Marisin; Hegde, Muralidhar L; Ks Jagannatha, Rao; Rao, Ts Sathyanarayana",Int J Soc Psychiatry,353,1

To our knowledge, there are a limited number of peer-reviewed studies that evaluate the perceived difficulties of the patients with cancer when filling their opioid prescription. To understand these difficulties, we surveyed patients receiving opioids in our outpatient supportive care center (SCC). OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study was to evaluate cancer patients' perceptions of overall difficulties when filling their opioid prescription. Secondary objectives included determining associations between patient characteristics and difficulty and comparing difficulty between filling opioid and nonopioid prescriptions. METHODS: Patients with cancer receiving opioids that had been seen two times or more at our SCC were asked to complete a survey. The information collected included patient demographics, clinical characteristics, and patients' experiences filling their opioid prescription. RESULTS: The patients' median age was 60 years; 54% were female and 69% were white. Forty-four patients (32%) reported that they have experienced difficulty filling their opioid prescription. More than 25% of those 44 patients perceived difficulty from interactions with the pharmacy and/or pharmacist. Forty-six patients (33%) reported more difficulty filling their opioid prescriptions than filling their nonopioid prescriptions. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that patients with cancer visiting our SCC perceived difficulties obtaining their opioid prescriptions. The results suggest that negative interactions with the pharmacy and/or pharmacist contribute to their perceived difficulty. Additional research is needed to further characterize the contributors of the difficulties patients with cancer face in filling their opioid prescriptions.","Brown, Jessica H; Torres, Hilda P; Maddi, Rama D; Williams, Janet L; Dibaj, Seyedeh S; Liu, Diane; Bruera, Eduardo",J Pain Symptom Manage,353,23

A systematic review and meta-analysis,18.79992,10.364116,2020,"Jararhagin is a hyperalgesic metalloproteinase from Bothrops jararaca venom. In rodents, jararhagin induces nociceptive behaviors that correlate with an increase in peripheral cytokine levels. However, the role of the spinal cord glia in pain processing after peripheral stimulus of jararhagin has not been investigated. Aiming to explore this proposal, mice received intraplantar (i.pl.) injection of jararhagin and the following parameters were evaluated: hyperalgesia, spinal cord TNF-α, IL-1β levels, and CX3CR1, GFAP and p-NFκB activation. The effects of intrathecal (i.t.) injection of TNF-α soluble receptor (etanercept), IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), and inhibitors of NFκB (PDTC), microglia (minocycline) and astrocytes (α-aminoadipate) were investigated. Jararhagin inoculation induced cytokine production (TNF-α and IL-1β) in the spinal cord, which was reduced by treatment with PDTC (40% and 50%, respectively). Jararhagin mechanical hyperalgesia and cytokine production were inhibited by treatment with etanercept (67%), IL-1Ra (60%), PDTC (70%), minocycline (60%) and α-aminoadipate (45%). Furthermore, jararhagin induced an increase in p-NFκB, CX3CR1 and GFAP detection in the spinal cord indicating activation of NFκB, microglia and astrocytes. These results demonstrate for the first time that jararhagin-induced mechanical hyperalgesia is dependent on spinal cord activation of glial cells, consequent NFκB activation, and cytokine production in mice.","Ferraz, Camila R.; Carvalho, Thacyana T.; Fattori, Victor; Saraiva-Santos, Telma; Pinho-Ribeiro, Felipe A.; Borghi, Sergio M.; Manchope, Marília F.; Zaninelli, Tiago H.; Cunha, Thiago M.; Casagrande, Rubia; Clissa, Patricia Bianca; Verri Jr, Waldiceu A.",Int.

Filtration process of the database was conducted using three levels of accuracy for molecular docking calculations. The top 35 drugs with docking scores > -11.0 kcal/mol were then subjected to 10 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations followed by molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) binding energy calculations. The results showed that DB02388 and Cobicistat (DB09065) exhibited potential binding affinities towards Mpro over 100 ns MD simulations, with binding energy values of -49.67 and -46.60 kcal/mol, respectively. Binding energy and structural analyses demonstrated the higher stability of DB02388 over Cobicistat. The potency of DB02388 and Cobicistat is attributed to their abilities to form several hydrogen bonds with the essential amino acids inside the active site of Mpro. Compared to DB02388 and Cobicistat, Darunavir showed a much lower binding affinity of -34.83 kcal/mol.

Aerosols from these procedures may be inhaled by bystanders, and there are consequent concerns regarding the transmission of infection or, specific to nebulized therapy, secondary drug exposure. AIM: To assess the efficacy of a proprietary high-efficiency-particulate-air-filtering extractor tent on reducing the aerosol dispersal of nebulized bronchodilator drugs. METHODS: The study was conducted in an unoccupied outpatient room at St. James's Hospital, Dublin, Ireland. A novel real-time, fluorescent particle counter, the Wideband Integrated Bioaerosol Sensor (WIBS), monitored room air continuously for 3 h. Baseline airborne particle count and count during nebulization of bronchodilator drug solutions were recorded. FINDINGS: Nebulization within the tent prevented any increase over background level. Nebulization directly into room air resulted in mean fluorescent particle counts of 4.75 x 105/m3 and 4.21 x 105/m3 for Ventolin and Ipramol, respectively, representing more than 400-fold increases over mean background level. More than 99.3% of drug particles were <2 µm in diameter and therefore small enough to enter the lower respiratory tract. CONCLUSION: The extractor tent was completely effective for the prevention of airborne spread of drug particles of respirable size from nebulized therapy. This suggests that extractor tents of this type would be efficacious for the prevention of airborne infection from aerosol-generating procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Fennelly, M; Keane, J; Dolan, L; Plant, B J; O039,; Connor, D J; Sodeau, J R; Prentice, M B",J Hosp Infect,353,16

However, the extent and nature of changes in health care utilization during the pandemic may differ by care setting. Knowledge of the impact of the pandemic on health care utilization is important to health care organizations and policy makers. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study are (1) to evaluate changes in in-person health care utilization and telehealth visits during the COVID-19 pandemic and (2) to assess the difference in changes in health care utilization between the pandemic year 2020 and the prepandemic year 2019. METHODS: We retrospectively assembled a cohort consisting of members of a large integrated health care organization, who were enrolled between January 6 and November 2, 2019 (prepandemic year), and between January 5 and October 31, 2020 (pandemic year). The rates of visits were calculated weekly for four settings: inpatient, emergency department (ED), outpatient, and telehealth. Using Poisson models, we assessed the impact of the pandemic on health care utilization during the early days of the pandemic and conducted difference-in-deference (DID) analyses to measure the changes in health care utilization, adjusting for the trend of health care utilization in the prepandemic year. RESULTS: In the early days of the pandemic, we observed significant reductions in inpatient, ED, and outpatient utilization (by 30.2%, 37.0%, and 80.9%, respectively). By contrast, there was a 4-fold increase in telehealth visits between weeks 8 (February 23) and 12 (March 22) in 2020. DID analyses revealed that after adjusting for prepandemic secular trends, the reductions in inpatient, ED, and outpatient visit rates in the early days of the pandemic were 1.6, 8.9, and 367.2 visits per 100 person-years (P<.001), respectively, while the increase in telehealth visits was 272.9 visits per 100 person-years (P<.001). Further analyses suggested that the increase in telehealth visits offset the reduction in outpatient visits by week 26 (June 28, 2020). CONCLUSIONS: In-person health care utilization decreased drastically during the early period of the pandemic, but there was a corresponding increase in telehealth visits during the same period. By end-June 2020, the combined outpatient and telehealth visits had recovered to prepandemic levels.","Xu, Stanley; Glenn, Sungching; Sy, Lina; Qian, Lei; Hong, Vennis; Ryan, Denison S; Jacobsen, Steven",J Med Internet Res,353,12

Responses were compared cross-sectionally with April-2020 data, and longitudinally among respondents who completed both surveys. Multivariable Poisson regressions were used to estimate prevalence ratios for adverse mental health symptoms, substance use, and suicidal ideation adjusted for demographics, sleep, and behaviours (e.g., screen-time, outdoor-time). In September-2020, among 1157 Victorians, one-third reported anxiety or depressive disorder symptoms, one-fifth reported suicidal ideation, and one-tenth reported having seriously considered suicide in the prior 30 days. Young adults, unpaid caregivers, people with disabilities, and people with diagnosed psychiatric or sleep conditions showed increased prevalence of adverse mental health symptoms. Prevalence estimates of symptoms of burnout, anxiety, and depressive disorder were unchanged between April-2020 and September-2020.

METHODS: data of allele frequencies of HLA-A, -B and -C and COVID-19 mortality were obtained for 74 countries from the Allele Frequency Net Database and worldometer.info. Association between allele frequency of each HLA and mortality was assessed by linear regression followed by multivariable regression. Subsequently, association of HLA-C*05 to its receptor KIR2DS4fl, expressed on natural killer (NK) cells, and differential mortality to historic pandemics were analyzed. RESULTS: HLA-A*01, -B*07, -B*08, -B*44 and -C*05 were significantly associated with the risk of deaths (adjusted p = 0.040, 0.00081, 0.047, 0.0022, 0.00032, respectively), but only HLA-C*05 remained statistically significant (p = 0.000027) after multivariable regression.

It exerts its mechanism of action by blocking the programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1). Toxicity concerns include immune-related toxicities, including colitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, endocrine toxicities and more rarely, myocarditis and other organ system toxicities. OBJECTIVE: To review a real-world case involving immunotherapy induced myocarditis after a patient received pembrolizumab and discuss how the current pandemic created complexity in toxicity management. DISCUSSION: An 83 year old male with metastatic lung cancer developed fatal myocarditis after receiving 2 doses of pembrolizumab. Applying the Naranjo score, the likelihood of pembrolizumab causing the myocarditis is probable, with a score of 6. Severe cardiac toxicities are rare with pembrolizumab, but can still occur. It is vital to be aware of these toxicities, and educate patients on signs and symptoms. Complicating the situation even further was the global pandemic, which created fear and hesitation in the patient and the patient's family to seek medical treatment out of fear of exposure. This pandemic adds another layer to the complexity of care for patients with cancer and management of toxicities. Pharmacists play a significant role in ensuring the safety and efficacy of medications, especially oncology agents. CONCLUSION: Proper education of patients regarding symptoms and when to report are paramount to assisting in early detection and intervention for immunotherapy-related adverse events. New management and treatment strategies will need to be discussed and implemented considering the changing landscape around the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Elder, Christopher T; Davis, Elizabeth C; Jaipal, Stephanie; Wight, Charles E",J Oncol Pharm Pract,353,1

R(t) reflects the epidemic dynamics based on readily available illness onset data, and is useful for the planning and implementation of public health and social measures. In the present study, we proposed a method for computing the R(t) of COVID-19, and applied this method to the epidemic in Osaka prefecture from February to September 2020. We estimated R(t) as a function of the time of infection using the date of illness onset. The epidemic in Osaka came under control around 2 April during the first wave, and 26 July during the second wave. R(t) did not decline drastically following any single intervention. However, when multiple interventions were combined, the relative reductions in R(t) during the first and second waves were 70% and 51%, respectively. Although the second wave was brought under control without declaring a state of emergency, our model comparison indicated that relying on a single intervention would not be sufficient to reduce R(t) < 1. The outcome of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to rely on political leadership to swiftly design and implement combined interventions capable of broadly and appropriately reducing contacts.","Nakajo, Ko; Nishiura, Hiroshi",,353,26

Many MSME Actors can not survive or in other words roll out. Various ways are done by MSMEs to stay afloat. One of them is by reducing the workforce and innovating and creativity following the developing conditions. However, there are many obstacles faced by MSMEs in the post-Covid 19 pandemic or the new normal. This is due to significant changes in government regulations and consumer behavior. So that it has an impact on the business run by MSMEs. The government that establishes health protocols to prevent the spread of Covid in every aspect of community activities and the spread of the Covid 19 Virus that still can not be handled makes consumer behavior more selective in choosing and using products. So that consumers only buy products that they need and guaranteed health at affordable prices and more are done online. This is the problem faced by MSMEs where the marketing of their products that have been marketed offline inevitably has to be done online. In addition, the required product quality standards must be guaranteed and safe Covid 19 Virus is a challenge for MSMEs to be strict in the production process activities to reach consumers. Another major problem is the business capital that is needed by MSMEs in running their businesses. The solution of these constraints provides directions and explanations related to the use of Digitalisasi Marketing for the onlinesales process.

Thus, the current study is an endeavor to prove our hypothesis that regulation of arsenate (AsV: 50, 100, and 150 mM) and arsenite (AsIII: 50, 100, and 150 µM) toxicity is time dependent (48-96 h) due to modulation in bio-accumulation pattern, AsA-GSH cycle, and non-enzymatic antioxidants in two paddy field cyanobacteria Nostoc muscorum ATCC27893 and Anabaena sp. PCC7120. After 48 h, reduction in growth associated with increased sensitivity index, As bio-accumulation, and oxidative stress was observed which further intensified after 96 h but the degree of damage was lesser than 48 h. It denotes a significant recovery in growth after 96 h which is correlated with decreased As bio-accumulation and oxidative stress due to increased efficiency of AsA-GSH cycle and non-enzymatic antioxidants. Both the species of As caused significant rise in oxidative biomarkers as evident by in -vitro analysis of O2·-, H2O2, and MDA equivalent contents despite appreciable rise in the activity antioxidative enzymes APX, DHAR, and GR. The study concludes that among both forms of arsenic, AsIII induced more toxic effect on growth by over-accumulating the ROS as evident by weak induction of AsA-GSH cycle to overcome the stress as compared to AsV. Further, with increasing the time exposure, apparent recovery was noticed with the lower doses of AsV, i.e., 50 and 100 mM and AsIII, i.e., 50 and 100 µM; however, the toxicity further aggravated with higher dose of both AsV and AsIII.

The ""Health Goals for Me"" framework, an individualized approach to HIV care, provides a framework to assess HrQoL. We analyzed several patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) to develop a practical toolkit to facilitate shared physician-patient decision-making. HrQoL subdomains, actionable in the clinical setting and measurable as PROMs, were selected. PROMs were collated through systematic literature searches, scored by the authors on usability, validation, and availability, after which practical recommendations were made. Nine subdomains were selected across physical, psychological, social, and environmental domains; 46 validated PROMs were identified. After pre-screening, from 39 evaluated PROMs, we recommended PROMs in the following subdomains: fatigue/energy loss, frailty/resilience, sleep disturbance, substance use, anxiety/depression, cognition, sexual function and desire, and stigma. Using this toolkit, healthcare professionals and PLHIV can collaborate and mutually agree on individual care objectives. Following the ""Health Goals for Me"" framework, appropriate care interventions can be implemented and reviewed in a continuous cycle. We discussed how eHealth interventions, which will have increasing importance in the post-COVID era, can facilitate improved HrQoL for PLHIV by utilizing toolkits such as the one described here. Implementation of this practical framework and the PROMs toolkit could provide a useful approach to assessing HrQoL in PLHIV and could enhance the physician's ability to gain valuable insights into the patient's daily life across a broad range of HrQoL issues.","Curran, Adrian; Arends, Joop; Buhk, Thomas; Cascio, Mario; Teofilo, Eugenio; van den Berk, Guido; Guaraldi, Giovanni",AIDS rev,353,28

Despite reports of neonatal COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 has not been consistently isolated in perinatal samples, thus definitive proof of transplacental infection is still lacking. To address these questions, we assessed investigative tools used to confirm maternal-fetal infection and known protective mechanisms of the placental barrier that prevent transplacental pathogen migration. Forty studies of COVID-19 pregnancies reviewed suggest a lack of consensus on diagnostic strategy for congenital infection. Although real-time polymerase chain reaction of neonatal swabs was universally performed, a wide range of clinical samples was screened including vaginal secretions (22.5%), amniotic fluid (35%), breast milk (22.5%) and umbilical cord blood. Neonatal COVID-19 was reported in eight studies, two of which were based on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgM in neonatal blood. Histological examination demonstrated sparse viral particles, vascular malperfusion and inflammation in the placenta from pregnant women with COVID-19. The paucity of placental co-expression of ACE-2 and TMPRSS2, two receptors involved in cytoplasmic entry of SARS-CoV-2, may explain its relative insensitivity to transplacental infection.

We carried out a 16-week longitudinal study examining the impact of these fully remote research experiences on mentees' psychosocial gains (e.g., identity). We studied the phenomenon of a remote research experience from the standpoint of the mentees ($N$=10) and their mentors ($N$=8), who were each interviewed seven and three times, respectively (94 total interviews). All mentees reported that this experience was highly beneficial through different factors and that they developed a sense of belonging, self-efficacy, and identity despite working remotely. Then, we synthesize these results with prior literature and develop a framework showing how different experiences and constructs affect the development of the physics and researcher identity. Gaining greater understanding regarding factors leading to the growth of psychosocial gains may help REU coordinators and REU mentors to re-design their undergraduate research program and provide the support that their mentees' needed to have a positive undergraduate research experience.","Alaee, Dina Zohrabi; Campbell, Micah K.; Zwickl, Benjamin M.",,353,16

Transmucosal routes include intranasal, buccal, sublingual and rectal. They are non-invasive routes for systemic drug delivery with the possibility of self-administration, or administration by family caregivers. In addition, their ability to offer rapid onset of action with reduced first-pass metabolism make them suitable for use in palliative and end-of-life care to provide fast relief of symptoms. This is particularly important in COVID-19, as patients can deteriorate rapidly. Despite the advantages, these routes of administration face challenges including a relatively small surface area for effective drug absorption, small volume of fluid for drug dissolution and the presence of a mucus barrier, thereby limiting the number of drugs that are suitable to be delivered through the transmucosal route. In this review, the merits, challenges and limitations of each of these transmucosal routes are discussed. The goals are to provide insights into using transmucosal drug delivery to bring about the best possible symptom management for patients at the end of life, and to inspire scientists to develop new delivery systems to provide effective symptom management for this group of patients.","Lam, Jenny K W; Cheung, Chucky C K; Chow, Michael Y T; Harrop, Emily; Lapwood, Susie; Barclay, Stephen I G; Wong, Ian C K",Adv Drug Deliv Rev,353,21

METHODS: All inpatient fracture cases performed over a 5-month period were identified and retrospective chart review performed. Patients were divided into pre- and COVID-era groups based on when surgery was performed relative to March 16, 2020 (the date elective operations were ceased), and groups were statistically compared. Patients with a COVID test result were further sub-divided into COVID negative and positive groups, and statistically compared. Statistical analysis was performed using independent t-test for continuous variables and chi-square analysis for categorical variables. RESULTS: One hundred and nineteen patients were identified, 38% females with average age of 58 years. Average length of stay was 7 days with average time from injury to surgery of 3 days and average time from admission to surgery of 1.3 days. Overall in-hospital complication rate was 29.4%, and 30-day mortality and readmission rates were 2.5% and 5%, respectively. Sixty-nine patients comprised the pre-COVID group, and 50 in the COVID-era group. There was no significant difference with respect to length of stay, time from injury to surgery, time from admission to surgery, need for post-operative ICU stay, in-hospital complication rate, 30-day mortality rate and 30-day readmission rate. Thirty-four patients had COVID testing, with 24 negative and 10 positive. COVID-positive patients had longer time from injury to surgery (8.5 days vs. 2 days, p = 0.003) and longer time from admission to surgery (2.7 days vs. 1.2 days, p = 0.034). While more COVID-positive patients required ICU admission post-operatively (60% vs. 21%, p = 0.036), there was no difference in overall complication rate. CONCLUSIONS: Orthopedic care of acute fracture patients was not affected by a global pandemic. The response of our Level 1 Trauma Center's orthopedic department can guide other hospitals if and when new surges in COVID cases arise, in order to prevent compromising appropriate orthopedic care.

Tens thousands of people have been infected with the disease. Our aim was to distinguish severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-positive patients from SARS-CoV-2-negative patients. We retrospectively compared the data of COVID-19 patients with those of suspected and confirmed SARS-CoV-2-negative patients (control patients). There were 78 COVID-19 patients and 26 control patients, whose median ages were significantly different (P = .001). The percentage of COVID-19 patients admitting exposure to Wuhan was obviously higher than that of control patients (X2 = 29.130; P < .001). Fever and cough appeared more frequently in COVID-19 patients than in the control patients. The routine blood workup parameters of COVID-19 patients did not change much and their mean counts were in the normal range. There were 38.5% of control patients had higher procalcitonin (PCT) levels than 0.5 ng/mL, which was significantly higher than that percentage of COVID-19 patients (X2 = 22.636; P < .05), and COVID-19 patients were also more likely to have decreased or normal urea and creatinine levels than control patients (X2 = 24.930, 8.480; P < .05).Younger age, exposure to Wuhan, fever, cough, and slight changes in routine blood workup parameters, urea and creatinine were important features discriminating COVID-19 from control patients. Slightly increased, but far less than 0.5 ng/mL, PCT levels also differentiated COVID-19 patients from control patients.","Chen, Xinyi; Yang, Yi; Huang, Min; Liu, Lili; Zhang, Xianxiang; Xu, Jing; Geng, Shaoqing; Han, Bo; Xiao, Jiangfeng; Wan, Yanyun",J. med. virol,353,31

Since recently it has been found that SARS-coronavirus are dependent on the host transcriptional factors (TF) to express the viral genes, efforts are required to understand the molecular interplay between virus and host response. By bioinformatic analysis, we investigated human TF that can bind the SARS-CoV-2 sequence and can be involved in viral transcription. In particular, we analyzed the key role of the TF involved in interferon response. We found that several TF could be induced by the interferon antiviral response, specifically some induced by IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) and by un-phosphorylated ISGF3, that were found to promote the transcription of several viral open reading frame. Moreover, we found 22 TF binding sites that are present only in the sequence of virus infecting humans and not in Bat coronavirus RaTG13. The 22 TF are involved in the IFN, the retinoic acid signaling and the regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II, thus facilitating its own replication cycle. This mechanism, by competition, may steal the human TF involved in these processes, explaining SARS-CoV-2 disruption of the IFN-I signalling in host cells and the mechanism of the SARS retinoic acid depletion syndrome leading to the cytokine storm. We identified also three TF binding sites present exclusively in the Brazilian SARS-CoV-2 P.1 variant that may explain the higher severity of the respiratory syndrome in this virus variant. These data shed light on SARS-CoV2 dependence from the host transcription machinery associated to interferon response and strengthen our knowledge about the transcription and replicative activity of the virus and could pave the way for new targets drug design and therapeutic approaches.","di Bari, Ighli; Franzin, Rossana; Picerno, Angela; Stasi, Alessandra; Cimmarusti, Maria Teresa; Di Chiano, Mariagiovanna; Curci, Claudia; Pontrelli, Paola; Chironna, Maria; Castellano, Giuseppe; Gallone, Anna; Sabbà, Carlo; Gesualdo, Loreto; Sallustio, Fabio",New Microbes New Infect,353,16

DESIGN: this is a retrospective/prospective observational hospital cohort. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: the study population includes all patients consecutively admitted to the emergency department of Città della salute e della scienza University Hospital from 01.03 to 31.05.2020 with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: patients were classified in two groups according to the findings of X-ray imaging, lung ultrasound and chest computer tomography, as pneumonia or not pneumonia patients. RESULTS: in multivariable analysis, factors most strongly associated with emergency department admission with pneumonia were age, oxygen saturation <90% (adj OR 4.16 ;95%CI 1.44-12.07), respiratory rate >24 breaths/min (adj OR 6.50; 95%CI 2.36-17.87), fever &#8805;38° (adj OR 3.05; 95%CI 1.53-6.08) and the presence of gastroenteric symptoms (vomiting and diarrhea). A delay (> 7 days) between the appearance of the initial lung symptoms (cough and dyspnea) and the admission to the emergency department was also related to a higher probability of receiving a positive imaging report (OR 4.99; 95%CI 2,02-12,34). CONCLUSIONS: in order to reorganize the management of COVID-19 patients in Italy, in view of the risk of a second wave of epidemic or of local outbreaks, it would be desirable to relocate the triage, and possibly the patient's care, from hospital to home. In this scenario it is important to identify all symptoms and signs associated with COVID-19 pneumonia that would facilitate the decision-making process of GPs leading to patients hospitalization.","Sacerdote, Carlotta; Castiglione, Anna; Pagano, Eva; Migliore, Enrica; Pivetta, Emanuele; Auzzas, Grazia Maria; Brenstisci, Carol; Brunetti, Francesco; Dafilé, Corina; Gangemi, Manuela; Giacometti, Lisa; Gilardetti, Marco; Martinis, Vitor Hugo; Saccona, Fabio; Stura, Antonella; Turco, Danila; Balestro, Cristina; Zozzoli, Susanna; Filandra, Umberto; Roggero, Stefano; Silvestre, Carlo; Scozzari, Gitana; Scaramozzino, Antonio; Ciccone, Giovannino",Epidemiol Prev,353,1

Knowledge of the viral structure, factors that help in its progression and spread, pathological findings, diagnostic methods and, treatment modalities helps in understanding the viral disease and also in treating the patients in a better way besides preventing the community spread of this deadly infection. The causative agent is a single- stranded RNA virus. The clinical spectrum varies in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, who later become potential silent carriers, thus unknowingly spreading the virus. The virus constantly undergoes recombination, with reports of cross-species infections. Studies have indicated a strong immunological basis of COVID-19 infection. Not only does it weaken the immune system causing multi-organ involvement but also helps in its progression and spread to others.Multiple organs especially lungs, heart, kidney, gastrointestinal and hepatic system, brain and skin are affected varying in their severity. Similarly, persons with associated co-morbidities are likely to be affected more in terms of the number as well as in the severity. Real- time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction confirms the presence of COVID-19 infection. Serological diagnosis helps in diagnosing an ongoing outbreak or retrospective infection. Furthermore, it also identifies individuals who have been infected or have recovered from the disease especially the asymptomatic. This helps in the development of an effective vaccine indicating the status of herd immunity in the community. Different treatment modalities are being tried and under trial. This review article thus highlights the global epidemiological status, characteristic of the virus, symptomatology of the patients, role of diagnostic tests available, organs affected including their morphological changes and the latest line of treatment of COVID-19.","Bal, Amanjit; Agrawal, Ranjan; Vaideeswar, Pradeep; Arava, Sudheer; Jain, Amita",Indian J Pathol Microbiol,353,15

Italy was one of the most affected countries, as the first European full-blown outbreak occurred there. The exposure of the Italian health care workers to COVID-19 may be an important risk factor for psychological distress. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to describe worries and risk perception of being infected among Italian Health Care Workers (HCWs) during the first wave of the pandemic. In total, 2078 HCWs participated in a web survey (78.8% were females). The highest percentage of respondents were physicians (40.75%) and nurses (32.15%), followed by medical (18.00%), health care support (4.50%) and administrative (4.60%) staff. In a score range between 0 (not worried) and 4 (very worried), our results showed that participants declared that they were worried about the Coronavirus infection with a median score of 3 (IQR 2-3) and for 59.19% the risk perception of being infected was very high. In addition, HCWs reported they suffered from sleep disturbances (63.43%). From the analysis of the psychological aspect, a possible divergence emerged between the perceived need for psychological support (83.85%) and the relative lack of this service among health care providers emerged (9.38%). Our findings highlight the importance of psychological and psychiatric support services not only during the COVID-19 pandemic, but also in other emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) scenarios. These services may be useful for health authorities and policymakers to ensure the psychological well-being of health care professionals and to promote precautionary behaviors among them.","Puci, Mariangela Valentina; Nosari, Guido; Loi, Federica; Puci, Giulia Virginia; Montomoli, Cristina; Ferraro, Ottavia Eleonora",,353,5

In addition to the nearly infinitely large search space, rigorous evaluation of a sample based on the reliable experimental or computational platform is often prohibitively expensive, making the screening problem more challenging. In such a case, constructing a high-throughput screening (HTS) pipeline that pre-sifts the samples expected to be potential candidates through the efficient earlier stages, results in a significant amount of savings in resources. However, to the best of our knowledge, despite many successful applications, no one has studied optimal pipeline design or optimal pipeline operations. In this study, we propose two optimization frameworks, applying to most (if not all) screening campaigns involving experimental or/and computational evaluations, for optimally determining the screening thresholds of an HTS pipeline. We validate the proposed frameworks on both analytic and practical scenarios. In particular, we consider the optimal computational campaign for the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) classification as a practical example. To accomplish this, we built the high-throughput virtual screening (HTVS) pipeline for classifying the lncRNA. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed frameworks significantly reduce the effective selection cost per potential candidate and make the HTS pipelines less sensitive to their structural variations. In addition to the validation, we provide insights on constructing a better HTS pipeline based on the simulation results.","Woo, Hyun-Myung; Qian, Xiaoning; Tan, Li; Jha, Shantenu; Alexander, Francis J.; Dougherty, Edward R.; Yoon, Byung-Jun",,353,27

There remains a significant unmet need for patients with hematological malignancies requiring specialized procedures and treatments, like cellular therapy to treat or cure their disease. For instance, chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy is approved for relapsed/refractory (after two or more lines of therapy) diffuse large B cell lymphoma and B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia that is refractory or in the second relapse in patients younger than 25 years of age. Similarly, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can be a lifesaving procedure for many patients, such as those with acute myeloid leukemia with high-risk cytogenetics. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic has thrust upon the hematologists and transplant specialists' unique challenges with the implementation and management of cellular therapy. One of the significant concerns regarding this immunocompromised patient population is the significant risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection due to its highly contagious nature. Experts have recommended that if medically indicated, especially in high-risk disease (where chemotherapy is unlikely to work), these lifesaving procedures should not be delayed even during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, proceeding with CAR-T cell therapy and HSCT during the pandemic is a considerable task and requires dedication from the transplant team and buy-in from the patients and their family or support system. Open conversations should be held with the patients about the risks involved in undergoing cellular therapies during current times and the associated future uncertainties.","Sahu, Kamal Kant; Ailawadhi, Sikander; Malvik, Natalie; Cerny, Jan",Adv Exp Med Biol,353,2

The significance of this finding is unclear and, in most patients, does not represent active infection. Detection of subgenomic RNA has been proposed to represent productive infection and may be a useful marker for monitoring infectivity. METHODS: We used RT-qPCR to quantify total and subgenomic nucleocapsid (sgN) and envelope (sgE) transcripts in 185 SARS-CoV-2 positive nasopharyngeal swab samples collected on hospital admission and to relate to symptom duration. RESULTS: We find that all transcripts decline at the same rate; however, sgE becomes undetectable before other transcripts. The median duration of symptoms to a negative test is 14 days for sgE and 25 days for sgN. There is a linear decline in subgenomic compared to total RNA suggesting subgenomic transcript copy number is dependent on copy number of total transcripts. The mean difference between total and sgN is 16-fold and the mean difference between total and sgE is 137-fold. This relationship is constant over duration of symptoms allowing prediction of subgenomic copy number from total copy number. CONCLUSIONS: Subgenomic RNA may be no more useful in determining infectivity than a copy number threshold determined for total RNA.","Dimcheff, Derek E; Valesano, Andrew L; Rumfelt, Kalee E; Fitzsimmons, William J; Blair, Christopher; Mirabelli, Carmen; Petrie, Joshua G; Martin, Emily T; Bhambhani, Chandan; Tewari, Muneesh; Lauring, Adam S",J. infect. dis,353,1

Elective interventions and surgical procedures in most countries have been postponed and operating room resources have been diverted to manage the pandemic. The Venous and Lymphatic Triage and Acuity Scale was developed to provide an international standard to rationalise and harmonise the management of patients with venous and lymphatic disorders or vascular anomalies. Triage urgency was determined based on clinical assessment of urgency with which a patient would require medical treatment or surgical intervention. Clinical conditions were classified into six categories of: (1) venous thromboembolism (VTE), (2) chronic venous disease, (3) vascular anomalies, (4) venous trauma, (5) venous compression and (6) lymphatic disease. Triage urgency was categorised into four groups and individual conditions were allocated to each class of triage. These included (1) medical emergencies (requiring immediate attendance), example massive pulmonary embolism; (2) urgent (to be seen as soon as possible), example deep vein thrombosis; (3) semi-urgent (to be attended to within 30-90 days), example highly symptomatic chronic venous disease, and (4) discretionary/non-urgent- (to be seen within 6-12 months), example chronic lymphoedema. Venous and Lymphatic Triage and Acuity Scale aims to standardise the triage of patients with venous and lymphatic disease or vascular anomalies by providing an international consensus-based classification of clinical categories and triage urgency. The scale may be used during pandemics such as the current COVID-19 crisis but may also be used as a general framework to classify urgency of the listed conditions.","Parsi, Kurosh; van Rij, Andre M; Meissner, Mark H; Davies, Alun H; Maeseneer, Marianne De; Gloviczki, Peter; Benson, Stephen; Bottini, Oscar; Canata, Victor Manuel; Dinnen, Paul; Gasparis, Antonios; Gianesini, Sergio; Huber, David; Jenkins, David; Lal, Brajesh K; Kabnick, Lowell; Lim, Adrian; Marston, William; Granados, Alberto Martinez; Morrison, Nick; Nicolaides, Andrew; Paraskevas, Peter; Patel, Malay; Roberts, Stefania; Rogan, Christopher; Schul, Marlin W; Komlos, Pedro; Stirling, Andrew; Thibault, Simon; Varghese, Roy; Welch, Harold J; Wittens, Cees Ha",Phlebology,353,23

KANOPEE is a smartphone-based application, providing an interaction with a virtual agent dedicated to screen and deliver behavioral interventions to fight sleep disorders. OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the feasibility study of this application, during the context of COVID-19 confinement in France. METHODS: The virtual agent is an AI program using decision tree architecture, and interacting through natural body motion and natural voice. 2,069 users aged 18 years and over downloaded the app during the inclusion period (between 22 April and 5 May 2020). Users first answered a screening interview based on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) that was conducted by the virtual agent. If participants were positive for insomniac complaints (ISI > 14), they could join a two-stage intervention program: a) complete an electronic sleep diary for one week, and b) follow personalized sleep recommendations for 10 days. Measures collected included socio-demographic information, ISI and sleep/wake schedules; and acceptance and trust of the agent. RESULTS: 80% of users who downloaded the app (N=1,574) completed the screening interview with the virtual agent. The virtual agent was well accepted by the 431 users who answered acceptance and trust questionnaires, regarding its usability, satisfaction, benevolence, and credibility. Of the 773 screened subjects who reported sleep complaints (ISI>14), 166 of them followed the first step of the intervention (21.5%). Of these, 47 (28.3%) followed the second step. Users who completed step one found that their insomnia complaints (mean scores: baseline ISI: 18.56; ISI after step one: 15.99; P<.001) and nocturnal sleep improved significantly after one week. Subjects who completed step 2 also showed an improvement compared to the initial measure (mean scores: baseline ISI: 18.87; ISI after step two: 14.68; P<.001).

Today, West Africa produces nearly two-thirds of Africa's rice. The region's rice import dependency has fallen from nearly half of local consumption in 2010 to about 30%. In spite of this improvement, the region remains the world's second largest rice importer. The situation of Benin, Burkina Fasso, Gambia and Niger remains challenging with rice import dependency still exceeding 70%. Production in some countries has fallen even below the 2010 level due to civil strife, climatic changes and macroeconomic difficulties. Countries of the region, on average, allocate less than 5% of their budget to agriculture, less than half the share committed in the Maputo Agreement. The Covid-19 outbreak and corresponding preventive lockdowns have posed a new challenge as food supply chains were stretched; production, transportation and consumption fell sharply; and household income was affected. In addition, closure of frontiers and temporary trade disruption in major Asian rice exporters has led to increase in rice prices in the international market. In late April, rice futures rose to reach a level not surpassed since 2011. This threatens to further aggravate an already fragile food security situation in the region. The crisis again points to the need for greater efforts at the national and international level to achieve food security. West African countries will need to enhance public spending on agriculture with a greater focus on measures aimed at improving rice productivity.","Fontan Sers, Charlotte; Mughal, Mazhar",World Dev.,353,14

Profiling of Asians or mongoloid looking individuals as a suspect carrier of the virus and the resultant taunts and discriminations occur worldwide. In India, the pandemic has reinforce racism against Northeast Indians, which the country has been grappling with this social problem in the last one decade or so. Such discriminations were overt acts of racial prejudice that primarily stems from the nonrecognition or misrecognition of Northeast Indians, who are mainly mongoloid race, as Indians. During the pandemic, the fight by Northeast Indians was with the mindset of the rest of Indians as much as the virus itself. It was a fight not only against the presumption of being ‘non-Indian’ with negative affiliation, or worse ‘unwanted Indians’, but also to get due recognition and acceptance as equal Indians. The absence of stringent anti-racism laws may have resulted in the pervasiveness of overt acts of racism during the pandemic. However, such actions are best understood on the structural elements that underpin Indian societies. The legal measures to address this social problem will reduce overt acts of racism but addressing covert racial acts, which are structural in nature, is a long way to go.","Haokip, Thongkholal",Asian Ethn.,353,12

This paper analyses a social network like Facebook as a not common tool for local government's communication in a period of severe emergency. A multidisciplinary approach is adopted as a distinctive factor. The focus is on the contribution of social communication on citizens' engagement.","Mori, Elisa; Barabaschi, Barbara; Cantoni, Franca; Virtuani, Roberta",J Public Aff,353,22

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe alcohol-related content posted by mothers on Instagram during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Using two popular hashtags, #momjuice and #winemom, 50 Instagram posts on each were collected from the ""top posts"" tab. The coding categories were created inductively and were as follows: displays alcohol (drinking/holding alcohol or alcohol itself), person is making alcoholic beverages, type of alcohol featured or discussed, highlights anxiety and/or depression/mental state, highlights struggling (in general), highlights parenting challenges, encourages alcohol consumption, discourages alcohol consumption, features a person wearing clothing or shows products promoting alcohol, promotes alcohol rehabilitation, highlights caffeine to alcohol daily transition throughout the day, and highlights other drugs besides caffeine and alcohol. RESULTS: Overall, the 100 selected posts had a total of 5108 comments and 94,671 likes. The respective averages were 51.08 (SD 77.94) and 946.71 (SD 1731.72). A majority (>50%) of the posts reviewed encouraged alcohol consumption (n=66) and/or displayed alcohol (n=56). Of the 66 that encouraged and/or displayed alcohol, the common type of alcohol discussed or featured was wine (n=55). Only 6 posts discouraged alcohol use and only 4 provided the audience with a disclaimer. None of the videos promoted or endorsed alcohol rehabilitation in any way. Only 37 posts highlighted struggle. However, these posts garnered more than a majority of the likes (n=50,034, 52.3%). Posts that showed struggle received an average of 1359.57 (SD 2108.02) likes. Those that did not show struggle had an average of 704.24 (SD 1447.46) likes. An independent one-tailed t test demonstrated this difference to be statistically significant (P=.0499). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this investigation suggest that though these hashtags ostensibly exist to valorize excess alcohol consumption, they may be serving as a support system for mothers who are experiencing increased burdens and role stress during the pandemic. Given the strains placed on mothers overall and especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, efforts must be taken to increase access to and affordability of telehealth-based mental health care.","Basch, Corey H; Meleo-Erwin, Zoe C; Mohlman, Jan; Fera, Joseph; Quinones, Nasia",JMIR Pediatr Parent,353,20

Little did we know that soon after Europe and the rest of the world (with Asia already earlier) would be in lock-down due to COVID-19. It has been a strange year. And now, at the start of 2021, the excitement of having a vaccine is tempered by the fact that everywhere mutants of the virus pop up. Although this was likely to occur, as also the influenza virus keeps mutating, it means that at the moment it is unclear as to whether the current situation of lock-downs and social distancing will remain for a longer period than we had anticipated and hoped for at the end of 2020 when it became clear that several vaccines were efficacious. Some studies have shown a role of the gut microbiota composition in disease severity, together with vitamin D, cholesterol and other factors. It was a hype to write a 'review' on gut microbiota and the effect on COVID-19, and also the board of Beneficial Microbes has received several submissions of so-called reviews on the topic. However, all of them were rejected, as they were mere speculations about how the gut microbiota might affect virus infection and disease severity, without any data whatsoever. However, there are some good studies out there that have shown that a proper gut microbiota may indeed influence disease severity, such as recently reviewed by Kim (2021). All in all, this may not be too surprising for the knowledgeable reader, as they would know that the microbiota plays a role in everything that can be wrong with us!","Venema, Koen",Benef Microbes,353,20

MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted in expected 290 participants: 230 patients and 60 medical staff, during the four-month national COVID-19 outbreak period (Aug - Sep 2020, and Dec 2020 - Jan 2021). All participants underwent both rapid antibody tests and RT-PCR (at admission for patients). ResultsA total of 270 participants completed the study. Fever and URI symptoms were present in 6/210 patients (2.8%) while one patient (0.5%) had a history of traveling to a high-risk area. However, only two (1%) asymptomatic patients had positive IgM results. Concerning the medical personnel, 10% fell into the patient under investigation (PUI) category. 4/60 (6.7%) IgM positive was observed in the staff cohort in which 3/4 came from non-PUI participants. Neither participant had RT-PCR positive demonstrating a 1.9% total false positive rate. ConclusionRapid point-of-care antibody test can be used to screen either a pregnant coming for delivery, a patient who requires urgent/emergency operative procedures, or medical personnel, at least in the defined lower-prevalence COVID-19 situation.

In light of this and the COVID-19 pandemic we aimed to assess whether these patients could be safely assessed without direct contact between the clinician and patient. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of consecutive patients seen in our 'blurred disc clinic' between August 2018 and October 2019. We then presented anonymous information from their referral letter, their visual fields and optic nerve images to two consultant neuro-ophthalmologists blinded to the outcome of the face-to-face consultation. In the simulated virtual clinic, the two consultants were asked to choose an outcome for each patient from discharge, investigate or bring in for a face-to-face assessment. RESULTS: Out of 133 patients seen in the blurred disc clinic, six (4.5%) were found to have papilloedema. All six were identified by both neuro-ophthalmologists as needing a face-to-face clinic consultation from the simulated virtual clinic. One hundred and twenty (90%) patients were discharged from the face-to-face clinic at the first consultation. The two neuro-ophthalmologists chose to discharge 114 (95%) and 99 (83%) of these respectively from the simulated virtual clinic. The virtual clinic would have potentially missed serious pathology in only one patient who had normal optic discs but reported diplopia at the previous face-to-face consultation. CONCLUSIONS: A virtual clinic model is an effective way of screening for papilloedema in patients referred to the eye clinic with suspicious optic discs. Unrelated or incidental pathology may be missed in a virtual clinic.","Jefferis, Joanna M; Griffith, Nigel; Blackwell, Daniel; Batty, Ruth; Hickman, Simon J; Pepper, Irene M",Eur J Ophthalmol,353,21

Based on the clinical types, the patients were divided into a progression group and an improvement group. Multivariable logistic regression and ROC curve analysis were performed to explore the risk factors for disease progression.Results: A total of 101 patients were included in this study; diseases progression occurred in 17 patients, 84 patients improved, 6 were transferred to intensive care unit (ICU), and 5 died. The mean time to obtain negative nucleic acid results was 12.5 ± 5.0 days. Multivariate logistic analysis indicated that age (OR, 0.104; p = .002), C-reactive protein (CRP) (OR, 0.093; p < .001) and lymphocyte count (OR, 3.397; p = .022) were risk factors for disease progression. ROC curve analysis revealed that the AUC of age, CRP and lymphocyte count for disease progression were 0.873, 0.911 and 0.817, respectively.Conclusions: Older age increased CRP and decreased lymphocyte count resulted in potential risk factors for COVID-19 progression.

Guide RNAs shorter than 16 nucleotides in length effectively recruit Cas9 to complementary sites in the genome but do not permit Cas9 nuclease activity. Here we describe CRISPR Guide RNA Assisted Reduction of Damage (CRISPR GUARD) as a method for protecting off-targets sites by co-delivery of short guide RNAs directed against off-target loci by competition with the on-target guide RNA. CRISPR GUARD reduces off-target mutagenesis while retaining on-target editing efficiencies with Cas9 and base editor. However, we discover that short guide RNAs can also support base editing if they contain cytosines within the deaminase activity window. We explore design rules and the universality of this method through in vitro studies and high-throughput screening, revealing CRISPR GUARD as a rapidly implementable strategy to improve the specificity of genome editing for most genomic loci. Finally, we create an online tool for CRISPR GUARD design.","Coelho, Matthew A; De Braekeleer, Etienne; Firth, Mike; Bista, Michal; Lukasiak, Sebastian; Cuomo, Maria Emanuela; Taylor, Benjamin J M",Nat Commun,353,16

While there are still missing links in our understanding, the interplay of endothelium, complement system activation, and immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus is a surprisingly major factor in COVID-19 pathogenesis. One could envision COVID-19 becoming a novel hematological syndrome. This review is to discuss the available literature with regards to the involvement of the complement system, and coagulation cascade and their interaction with endothelium.","Wang, Xin; Sahu, Kamal Kant; Cerny, Jan",J. thromb. thrombolysis,353,10

However, the role of PHI in understanding and managing pandemics, citizens' role in this context, and which methods are relevant for collecting and processing data are still unclear, as is which types of data are relevant. This paper aims to clarify these issues and explore the role of PHI in managing and detecting pandemics. METHODS: Through a literature review we identified studies that explore the role of PHI in detecting and managing pandemics. Studies from five databases were screened: PubMed, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), IEEE Xplore, ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) Digital Library, and Cochrane Library. Data from studies fulfilling the eligibility criteria were extracted and synthesized narratively. RESULTS: Out of 417 citations retrieved, 53 studies were included in this review. Most research focused on influenza-like illnesses or COVID-19 with at least three papers on other epidemics (Ebola, Zika or measles). The geographic scope ranged from global to concentrating on specific countries. Multiple processing and analysis methods were reported, although often missing relevant information. The majority of outcomes are reported for two application areas: crisis communication and detection of disease outbreaks. CONCLUSIONS: For most diseases, the small number of studies prevented reaching firm conclusions about the utility of PHI in detecting and monitoring these disease outbreaks. For others, e.g., COVID-19, social media and online search patterns corresponded to disease patterns, and detected disease outbreak earlier than conventional public health methods, thereby suggesting that PHI can contribute to disease and pandemic monitoring.","Gabarron, Elia; Rivera-Romero, Octavio; Miron-Shatz, Talya; Grainger, Rebecca; Denecke, Kerstin",Yearb. med. inform.

Up to now, however, the efficacy of school closure to reduce the spread of the disease in the community still remains unclear and no much is known about the potential negative effects of such measures on physical health and psychological wellbeing of youths, mainly if protracted for long periods. OBJECTIVE: To summarize the data of a systematic review on the impact of the 2020 school closure and social distances measures implemented in response to covid-19 pandemic on youths' physical health and psychological wellbeing. In the present paper we describe the impact on psychological wellbeing. METHODS: We searched 11 international databases up to 1st September 2020 to retrieve cohort studies, cross sectional surveys, uncontrolled pre-post studies and modelling studies. Methodological quality of included studies has been assessed with validated checklists. RESULTS: Sixty-four studies have been included; 27 assessed the impact on psychological wellbeing. All the studies have been conducted during the first wave of pandemic and assessed the short-term effect of social distances measures implemented for relatively short periods. The majority of the studies were conducted in the UK (37,6%) and China (27%). The 42.3% has been judged of high methodological quality. Two studies reported an increase of suicides, while two studies reported a reduction of the access to Psychiatric Emergency Department, Maltreatment allegations decreased substantially, likely due to a reduction in reports rather than actual incidence. Prevalence of anxiety among adolescents ranged between 19% and 64%, depression between 22.3% and 43.7%. Among children 5-12 years old, prevalence of anxiety varied between 19% and 78%, while depression between 6.3% and 22.6%. Among pre-school children, some studies found worsening of behavioural and emotional problems while others did not. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the studies reported relevant worsening of the psychological wellbeing, mainly among adolescents. If school closure and rigid social distances measures will extend for a long time, an even more pronounced negative effect can be expected. Further studies are needed on the long-term effect of prolonged social distances measures, as well as a careful harm-benefit analysis of the impact of such measures.","Minozzi, Silvia; Saulle, Rosella; Amato, Laura; Davoli, Marina",Recenti Prog Med,353,1

It was expected that income and its rate of deterioration as an economic factor, insufficient opportunities to talk to others and subjective feelings of isolation as social variables, and worries about income impairment, worries related to Covid-19, low tolerance of uncertainty, rumination and catastrophizing as psychological variables, will reduce the frequency of positive experiencing, increase the frequency of negative experiencing and the number of depressive symptoms. On the other hand, personal belief in a just world and a positive reappraisal were expected to positively affect the research variables. Sample and settings. The online data collection was carried out at the end of April 2020 at the peak of the number of people affected by the disease in Slovakia. It was a stratified selection of N = 1108 persons, taking into account the proportional representation of persons from the territory of the whole republic. Statistical analysis. Variable relationships were tested using PLS-SEM (Partial Least Squares - SEM). This procedure was preferred for three reasons: the exploratory nature of complex models, the predictive orientation of models, and the measurement of multiple variables with one-item questioning. Results. Three predictors out of 16 tested had a positive relationship to the frequency of positive experiencing as an affective component of subjective well-being - subjectively assessed health, personal belief in a just world, and a positive reappraisal;rumination was in a negative relationship. Six predictors were related to the frequency of negative experiencing as an affective component of subjective well-being and to symptoms of depression - in addition to the four mentioned above, it was age and worries about income impairment: with higher age, the frequency of negative experiencing and the number of depressive symptoms decreased, and a positive relation had also variables: subjective assessment of health, personal belief in a just world and a positive reappraisal. Worries about income impairment and rumination had a relationship to the frequency of negative experiencing and depressive symptoms. Study limitations. Cross sectional research did not provide information on changes in the affective component of subjective well-being and depressive symptoms of the Slovak population as a result of the pandemic, as the obtained data could not be compared with the results of the same participants from the period before the pandemic. Although this research can be considered representative in several aspects, the validity of the findings is limited by the fact that no specific groups were included in the sample - e.g. the most vulnerable groups were medical staff and the elderly over 70 years of age. Also, those who were ill or suspected of having Covid-19 were excluded from the analysis. Finally, data collection via the Internet presupposes a certain standard of living of respondents. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Ciele a hypotézy. Cieľom štúdie bolo zistiť, aký vzťah majú ekonomické a sociálne faktory v čase vrcholenia pandémie Covid-19 k afektívnej zložke subjektívnej pohody a symptómom depresie obyvateľov Slovenska, a ako sú tieto premenné ovplyvnené subjektívne prežívanými obavami a vybranými psychologickými charakteristikami opytovaných osôb. Bolo očakávané, že príjem a miera jeho zhoršenia ako ekonomický faktor, nedostatočné možnosti rozprávať sa s inými a subjektívny pocit izolovanosti ako sociálne premenné, obavy zo zhoršenia príjmu, obavy z ochorenia Covid-19, nízka miera tolerancie neurčitosti, ruminácia a katastrofizácia ako psychologické premenné, budú znižovať frekvenciu pozitívneho prežívania, zvyšovať frekvenciu negatívneho prežívania a počet symptómov depresie. Na druhej strane bolo očakávané, že osobná viera v spravodlivý svet a pozitívne prehodnotenie budú pozitívne ovplyvňovať sledované premenné. Demografické premenné a zdravotné charakteristiky opytovaných osôb boli kontrolované. Výskumná vzorka. On-line zber výskumných dát bol realizovaný koncom mesiaca apríl 2020 v čase kulminácie počtu chorobou postihnutých osôb na Slovensku. Išlo o stratifikovaný výber N = 1108 osôb so zohľadnením proporcionálneho zastúpenia osôb z územia celej republiky - každý z ôsmich samosprávnych krajov Slovenska bol zastúpený proporcionálnym počtom opytovaných osôb (rozpätie 105-164 osôb). Výskumná vzorka bola z hľadiska zastúpenia rodu a čiastočne aj rodinného stavu vyvážená, z hľadiska veku išlo o dospelé osoby vo veku 18 až 70 rokov a z hľadiska typu ekonomickej aktivity prevažovali zamestnané osoby, resp. osoby, ktoré mali v čase výskumu vlastný príjem. Štatistická analýza. Vzťahy premenných boli testované pomocou PLS-SEM (partial least squares - SEM). Táto procedúra bola uprednostnená z troch dôvodov: exploratívna povaha komplexných modelov, predikčná orientácia modelov a meranie väčšieho počtu premenných s jedno-itemovým opytovaním. Výsledky. Prezentované sú výsledky deskriptívnej analýzy meraných premenných, evaluácia modelov merania a evaluácia testovaných modelov. Tri prediktory zo 16 testovaných mali pozitívny vzťah k frekvencii pozitívneho prežívania ako afektívneho komponentu subjektívnej pohody - subjektívne hodnotené zdravie, osobná viera v spravodlivý svet a pozitívne prehodnotenie, ruminácia bola v negatívnom vzťahu. Šesť prediktorov malo vzťah k frekvencii negatívneho prežívania ako afektívneho komponentu subjektívnej pohody a k symptómom depresie - okrem štyroch vyššie uvedených, to bol vek a obavy zo zhoršenia príjmu: s vyšším vekom frekvencia negatívneho prežívania a počet symptómov depresie klesali a pozitívny vzťah mali aj subjektívne hodnotené zdravie, osobná viera v spravodlivý svet a pozitívne prehodnotenie. Obavy zo zhoršenia príjmu a ruminácia mali vzťah k frekvencii negatívneho prežívania a depresívnej symptomatológii. Obmedzenia štúdie. Prierezový výskum neposkytol informáciu o zmenách afektívnej zložky subjektívnej pohody a symptómov depresie obyvateľov Slovenska v dôsledku pandémie, lebo získané dáta nebolo možné porovnať s výsledkami tých istých osôb z obdobia pred pandémiou. Napriek tomu, že výskum možno z viacerých aspektov považovať za reprezentatívny, platnosť zistení je obmedzená tým, že do vzorky neboli zaradené špecifické skupiny - napr. najohrozenejšie skupiny, akými bol zdravotnícky personál, staršie osoby nad 70 rokov a ďalej, z analýzy boli vylúčené osoby, ktoré boli choré na Covid-19 alebo mali na toto ochorenie podozrenie. A konečne, zber údajov prostredníctvom internetu predpokladá určitý životný štandard respondentov. Psychologické a politické indikácie sú uvedené v závere štúdie.

However, data on impact of timing of therapy, efficacy, and safety are limited. We evaluated the impact of timing of remdesivir initiation (symptom onset to remdesivir treatment [SORT] interval) on in-hospital all-cause mortality in patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted between June 25 and October 3, 2020, at a tertiary care dedicated COVID center in India. Patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 (moderate: SpO2 <94%; severe: SpO2 <90%) were included. The main outcome was impact of SORT interval on in-hospital all-cause mortality. Subgroups were formed and analyzed based on SORT interval. RESULTS: Of 350 patients treated with remdesivir, 346 were included in the final analysis. Overall, 76 (22.0%) patients died (moderate: 3 [2.8%], severe: 73 [30.8%]). All-cause mortality was significantly lower in patients with SORT interval &#8804;9 days (n = 260) vs SORT interval >9 days (n = 86; 18.1% vs 33.7%; p = 0.004). The odds of death were significantly lower in patients with SORT interval &#8804;9 days vs >9 days (odds ratio = 0.43; 95% CI, 0.25-0.75; p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Remdesivir initiation &#8804;9 days from symptom onset was associated with mortality benefit, defining a treatment window and reinforcing the need for appropriately-timed remdesivir in moderate-to-severe COVID-19.","Mehta, Ravindra M; Bansal, Sameer; Bysani, Suhitha; Kalpakam, Hariprasad",Int J Infect Dis,353,26

One is that of transforming our links with nature and, particularly, wildlife given the likely COVID-19 origin from illegal wildlife trading. Similar to vector borne diseases (VBD, diseases transmitted by vectors), the COVID-19 pandemic follows related patterns (e.g. no effective or available vaccines, difficult to diagnose, highly localized infection geographical foci, non-human reservoirs) for which we urgently need preventive measures. Towards this aim, governments worldwide must strive to prevent further devastation of natural environments that serve as buffer areas to humans against zoonotic agents (among other health risks), protecting biodiversity and its concomitant causes (e.g. global change), and banning use of wildlife of illegal origin. We herein state that some VBD prevention strategies could also be applied to zoonotic disease prevention, including COVID-19 or any type likely to be related to environmental conditions.

This project aimed to explore the subjective experiences of staff working in Liaison Psychiatry (LP) in the Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Foundation Trust, (BSMHFT) during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings have been used to devise recommendations for subsequent waves.MethodData collection occurred as part of a mixed method service evaluation project. We invited all clinical and non-clinical staff from LP departments across BSMHFT to participate in focus groups conducted via Microsoft Teams. The focus groups were video-recorded and facilitated by a moderator and an observer. Subsequent anonymised transcripts were coded and themes were generated by at least two evaluators, using thematic analysis.ResultThe focus groups, which ranged from 21 to 69 minutes, involved consultants, junior doctors and nurses from four hospitals within BSMHFT. Six major themes emerged including an initial reduction in number yet increase in acuity of patients seen by LP, with some perception that this resulted from reduced face-to-face contact with community mental health services. A feeling that LP was lost at the interface between the physical and mental health trusts emerged as another theme. Uncertainty in adapting to unprecedented working conditions, for example, unclear guidance concerning the use of personal protective equipment, was also described alongside anxiety about contracting and transmitting SARS-Cov-2. Additionally, increased pressure was felt due to staff shortages and inadequate inter-departmental communication. Participants reported differential uptake of remote working, as well as conflicting views regarding the feasibility of remote assessments in LP.ConclusionLiaison psychiatry staff within BSMHFT continued to provide a crucial service during the COVID-19 pandemic. Focus groups with thes staff indicate several recommendations for implementation within the Trust and provoke questions for future research. Due to the unique role that LP plays in providing mental health care within general hospitals, clear guidance for LP staff is key for effective service provision and supporting LP staff. Although used widely across community mental health services, the role of remote working in LP is contentious and requires further exploration. However, there are limitations to the use of focus groups and these findings may not fully represent the experiences of LP staff throughout BSMHFT. Different themes may have emerged through the use of anonymous questionnaires.","Jehanzeb, Saima Suleman Muhammad Tumelty Ella Okusanya Joanne Karunanithy Laxsan Thomas Lucretia Bagchi Dhruba Hashmi Mahnaz",BJPsych Open,353,1

We present a phylogenetic study to explore viral introduction and evolution during the exponential early phase of the local COVID-19 outbreak from February 26th until March 23rd. We sequenced SARS-CoV-2 naso-oropharyngeal swabs from 746 positive tests that were performed at the University Hospital Basel during the study period. We successfully generated 468 high quality genomes from unique patients and called variants with our COVID-19 Pipeline (COVGAP), and analysed viral genetic diversity using PANGOLIN taxonomic lineages. To identify introduction and dissemination events we incorporated global SARS-CoV-2 genomes and inferred a time-calibrated phylogeny. Epidemiological data from patient questionnaires was used to facilitate the interpretation of phylogenetic observations. The early outbreak in Basel was dominated by lineage B.1 (83·6%), detected first on March 2nd, although the first sample identified belonged to B.1.1. Within B.1, 68·2% of our samples fall within a clade defined by the SNP C15324T ('Basel cluster'), including 157 identical sequences at the root of the 'Basel cluster', some of which we can specifically trace to regional spreading events. We infer the origin of B.1-C15324T to mid-February in our tri-national region. The other genomes map broadly over the global phylogenetic tree, showing several introduction events from and/or dissemination to other regions of the world via travellers. Family transmissions can also be traced in our data. A single lineage variant dominated the outbreak in the Basel area while other lineages, such as the first (B.1.1), did not propagate. A mass gathering event was the predominant initial source of cases, with travel returners and family transmissions to a lesser extent. We highlight the importance of adding specific questions to epidemiological questionnaires, to obtain data on attendance of large gatherings and their locations, as well as travel history, to effectively identify routes of transmissions in up-coming outbreaks. This phylogenetic analysis in concert with epidemiological and contact tracing data, allows connection and interpretation of events, and can inform public health interventions.

Changes required of providers were substantial and could lead to increased burnout and, subsequently, increased turnover intentions. This study examined burnout experienced by mental health services providers in the context of COVID-19 and through the lens of the job demands-resources (JD-R) model. We examined the effects of work changes on burnout and subsequent turnover intentions, and how job and personal resources may have buffered the extent to which work changes due to COVID-19 impacted burnout. Methods: Service providers (n = 93) from six community mental health centers (CMHCs) in one Midwestern state in the United States completed surveys as part of service contracts to implement evidence-based practices. Path analysis tested the unconditional indirect relations between work changes and turnover intentions through burnout. Moderated mediation determined whether the indirect effect of work changes on turnover intentions via burnout varied in strength by job and personal resources. Results: Work changes had a significant indirect effect on turnover intentions through burnout ( ß ^ = .140, 95% CI = .072, .217). This indirect effect varied as a function of two job resources, organizational trust and perceived organizational support. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: Burnout was relatively low only when work changes were low and job resources levels high. When work changes were high, burnout was similarly high across levels of job resources. To minimize burnout, organizations should limit task, setting, and team-related work changes to the extent possible.

We applied air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures of well-differentiated porcine airway cells to mimic the respiratory tract epithelium in vitro and use it for analyzing the infection by PRCoV. As reported for most coronaviruses, virus entry and virus release occurred mainly via the apical membrane domain. A novel finding was that PRCoV preferentially targets non-ciliated and among them the non-mucus-producing cells. Aminopeptidase N (APN), the cellular receptor for PRCoV was also more abundantly expressed on this type of cell suggesting that APN is a determinant of the cell tropism. Interestingly, differentiation-dependent differences were found both in the expression of pAPN and the susceptibility to PRCoV infection. Cells in an early differentiation stage express higher levels of pAPN and are more susceptible to infection by PRCoV than are well-differentiated cells. A difference in the susceptibility to infection was also detected when tracheal and bronchial cells were compared. The increased susceptibility to infection of bronchial epithelial cells was, however, not due to an increased abundance of APN on the cell surface. Our data reveal a complex pattern of infection in porcine differentiated airway epithelial cells that could not be elucidated with immortalized cell lines. The results are expected to have relevance also for the analysis of other respiratory viruses.","Peng, Ju-Yi; Punyadarsaniya, Darsaniya; Shin, Dai-Lun; Pavasutthipaisit, Suvarin; Beineke, Andreas; Li, Guangxing; Wu, Nai-Huei; Herrler, Georg",Viruses,353,1

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the anxiety and depression and general effect of COVID-19 pandemic on AR patients' psychological status in Wuhan, China. METHODS: In October 2019, 222 outpatients suffering from AR in our department and 133 healthy controls were enrolled. All participants were asked to finish the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) questionnaire. The demographic characteristics and the severity of AR symptoms were recorded. In April 2020, the AR patients and healthy controls were re-contacted to finish the questionnaires by telephone or online. The SAS and SDS scores in AR patients and healthy controls and the correlation with other variables were analyzed. RESULTS: For AR patients, the SAS and SDS scores were significantly higher than healthy controls. Meanwhile, the rates of anxiety and depression were 24.8% and 19.4% respectively. The education level and symptoms severity were correlated with SAS and SDS scores. Ninety-eight AR patients and 56 healthy controls finished the questionnaires after COVID-19 pandemic. The AR patients' SAS and SDS scores were lower than before COVID-19 pandemic and were correlated with AR symptom scores. The scores of healthy controls were not different with before COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of anxiety and depression is common in AR patients. Severity of symptoms and low education level are the risk factors causing anxiety and depression.

Descriptive statistics were used to report the findings from this project. RESULTS: Each of the 50 state governor's websites and individual state chiropractic licensing board's websites were surveyed. Stay-at-home or shelter-in-place orders were issued in 86% of all states. Chiropractors were classified as essential providers in 54% of states, non-essential in one state (2%), and no guidance was provided in the remaining 44% of all states. Fourteen states (28%) recommended restricting visits to only urgent cases and the remaining states (72%) provided no guidance. Twenty-seven states (54%) provided information regarding protecting against infectious disease and the remaining states (46%) provided no guidance. Twenty-two states (44%) provided recommendations regarding chiropractic telehealth and the remaining states (56%) provided no guidance. Seventeen states (34%) altered license renewal requirements and eight states (16%) issued warnings against advertising misleading or false information regarding spinal manipulation and protection from COVID-19. CONCLUSION: State guidance during the COVID-19 pandemic was heterogenous, widely variability in accessibility, and often no guidance was provided by state chiropractic licensing boards. Some state chiropractic licensing boards chose to assemble guidance for licensees into a single location, which we identified as a best practice for future situations where changes in chiropractic practice must be quickly communicated.","Neff, Shawn M; Roecker, Christopher B; Okamoto, Casey S; Holguin, Samuel L; Napuli, Jason G; Mattox, Ross; Hinkeldey, Nathan A; Paris, David J",Chiropr Man Therap,353,24

China has imposed the strictest quarantine and closed management measures in history to control the spread of the disease. However, a high level of evidence to support the surgical management of potential trauma patients during the novel coronavirus outbreak is still lacking. To regulate the emergency treatment of trauma patients during the outbreak, we drafted this paper from a trauma surgeon perspective according to practical experience in Wuhan. MAIN BODY: The article illustrates the general principles for the triage and evaluation of trauma patients during the outbreak of COVID-19, indications for emergency surgery, and infection prevention and control for medical personnel, providing a practical algorithm for trauma care providers during the outbreak period. CONCLUSIONS: The measures of emergency trauma care that we have provided can protect the medical personnel involved in emergency care and ensure the timeliness of effective interventions during the outbreak of COVID-19.","Li, Yang; Zeng, Ling; Li, Zhanfei; Mao, Qingxiang; Liu, Ding; Zhang, Letian; Zhang, Huayu; Xie, Yu; Liu, Guo; Gan, Xiaoqin; Yang, Fan; Zhou, Siru; Ai, Shanmu; Tang, Hao; Zhong, Qiu; Lu, Hongxiang; Zhang, Huacai; Talmy, Tomer; Zhang, Weiguo; Chen, Liyong; Bai, Xiangjun; Jiang, Jianxin; Zhang, Lianyang",World J Emerg Surg,353,3

Studies with more patients are needed to clarify the maintenance rate of postoperative hearing function and to identify prognostic of hearing function. METHOD: Ninety-one patients (mean age, 39.5 years; mean tumor size, 18.9 mm) with preserved useful hearing immediately after surgery were retrospectively analyzed. The useful hearing was defined as the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) classes A and B. Hearing tests, including auditory brainstem responses (ABR) and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE), were evaluated preoperatively, immediately after surgery, and at outpatient follow-up. RESULTS: At the final follow-up (mean, 63.0 months), the useful hearing was maintained in 79 patients (87%), and the hearing class remained unchanged during the follow-up period in 40 patients (44%). Significant predictors of useful hearing maintenance were AAO-HNS class A immediately after surgery, improvement of ABR, and the absence of postoperative DPOAE deterioration. Postoperative DPOAE deterioration correlated with hearing class deterioration. CONCLUSIONS: Despite hearing being preserved in vestibular schwannoma patients immediately after surgery, Thirteen percent lost their useful hearing during the long follow-up period, and hearing class worsened in 55% of the patients. This study, which analyzed one of the largest series of vestibular schwannoma patients, demonstrated that retrocochlear condition is a key factor for useful hearing maintenance. In patients with vestibular schwannoma who have preserved hearing function, regular postoperative monitoring of hearing function is as important as regular MRI.","Ichimasu, Norio; Kohno, Michihiro; Nakajima, Nobuyuki; Matsushima, Ken; Tanaka, Yujiro; Tsukahara, Kiyoaki; Inagaki, Taro; Yoshino, Masanori; Nagata, Osamu",Acta neurochir,353,0

There is limited knowledge of whether SARS-CoV-2 is physically associated with human metalloproteins. Recently, high-confidence, experimentally supported protein-protein interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and human proteins were reported. In this work, 58 metalloproteins among these human targets have been identified by a structure-based approach. This study reveals that most human metalloproteins interact with the recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 orf8 protein, whose antibodies are one of the principal markers of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Furthermore, this work provides sufficient evidence to conclude that Zn2+ plays an important role in the interplay between the novel coronavirus and humans. First, the content of Zn-binding proteins in the involved human metalloproteome is significantly higher than that of the other metal ions. Second, a molecular linkage between the identified human Zn-binding proteome with underlying medical conditions, that might increase the risk of severe illness from the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has been found. Likely perturbations of host cellular metal homeostasis by SARS-CoV-2 infection are highlighted.","Chasapis, Christos T; Georgiopoulou, Athanasia K; Perlepes, Spyros P; Bjørklund, Geir; Peana, Massimiliano",J Inorg Biochem,353,10

It has resulted in enormous economic as well as social costs, such as increased deaths from the spread of infection in a region. This is because public regulations imposed by national and local governments to deter the spread of infection inevitably involves a deliberate suppression of the level of economic activity. Given this trade-off between economic activity and epidemic prevention, governments should execute public interventions to minimize social and economic losses from the pandemic. A major problem regarding the resultant economic losses is that it unequally impacts certain strata of the society. This raises an important question on how such economic losses should be shared equally across the society. At the same time, there is some antipathy towards economic compensation by means of public debt, which is likely to increase economic burden in the future. However, as Paul Samuelson once argued, much of the burden, whether due to public debt or otherwise, can only be borne by the present generation, and not by future generations.","Noguchi, Asahi",,353,20

Further analyses revealed an association between maternal dp-pp.pc1.D&#8593;&#8595;A&#8593;R&#8593;&#8595;L&#8595; and increased child BMIZ (p = 0.036). Child ch.pc1.D&#8593;R&#8593;C&#8593; was associated with decreased birth weight (p = 0.036) and increased child BMIZ (p = 0.002). Child ch.pc2.D&#8595;A&#8593;L&#8593; was associated with increased child BMIZ (p = 0.005), decreased maternal height (p = 0.030) and girls (p = 0.002). A pattern of elevated maternal adiponectin and leptin in pregnancy was associated with increased C-reactive protein, vitamin A, and D binding proteins pattern in children, suggesting biomarkers acting in concert may have qualitative as well as quantitative influence beyond single biomarker effects. Patterns in pregnancy proximal to birth were more associated with child status. In addition, child patterns were more associated with child status, particularly child BMI. MMN supplementation affects maternal biomarker patterns of metabolism and inflammation in pregnancy, and potentially in the child. However, child nutrition conditions after birth may have a greater impact on metabolism and inflammation.","Priliani, Lidwina; Oktavianthi, Sukma; Prado, Elizabeth L; Malik, Safarina G; Shankar, Anuraj H",PLoS One,353,20

Within the scope of the study, information about demographic variables, physical activity and emotional state were collected with the form created by the researchers. In the study, ""Leisure Boredom Scale"" and ""Psychological Resilience Scale"" were used as the measurement tools. In the study, individuals were asked to write a word expressing their thoughts on the CoViD-19 process for descriptive analyses, and the collected data were visualized with the ""MAXQDA"" qualitative data analysis program.

In the statistical analysis of the study, descriptive statistics were used, t-test was used to determine the difference between independent groups, Pearson correlation analysis was used to determine the relationships between variables, and simple linear regression analysis was used to determine the strength of the independent variable in predicting the dependent variable. As a result, predominantly negative emotional states were observed in individuals during the quarantine period. However, as the participation in physical activity increases, the level of psychological resilience will increase and the perception of boredom in leisure time will decrease. Besides, it was found that the perception of boredom in leisure time was an important determinant of the level of psychological resilience, and that it explains about 15% of the variance.","Dursun, M.; Yarayan, Y.

This study aimed to examine the perceived risks of tobacco use on COVID-19 infection and severity, and possible COVID-related changes in perceptions of tobacco use and overall health. METHODS: We conducted an online survey of adults in the United States in June 2020 (n=2097). The survey covered cigarettes, cigars, e-cigarettes, and hookah. We also assessed changes in the use of any of the four tobacco products. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds of agreeing with the perceived risks for each risk and each product, with the adjustment of demographic and COVID-19 related variables. RESULTS: For all four tobacco products, the perceived risks to general health were slightly higher during the pandemic than before the pandemic (77% vs 79.5% for cigarettes) and the perceived risk of COVID-19 severity was larger than the perceived risk of COVID-19 infection (73.3% vs 56.2% for cigarettes). All risk measures varied with tobacco products consistently, with the risks highest for cigarettes, then cigars, followed by e-cigarettes and hookah. Females and people with higher income or education were more likely to endorse the risks of tobacco use than their counterparts. People who perceived higher risks of using cigarettes (OR=1.65;95% CI: 1.20-2.27) and cigars (OR=1.63;95% CI: 1.17-2.27) to COVID-19 severity were more likely to have decreased or quit their use. CONCLUSIONS: Tobacco/nicotine use was perceived to increase the risk of COVID-19 severity and the perceived risk of tobacco/nicotine use to general health was high during the pandemic, particularly for cigarettes. The change of perceived risks appeared to be prompting harm-reducing changes in tobacco product use.","Yang, Y.; Lindblom, E. N.; Salloum, R. G.; Ward, K. D.",Tobacco Induced Diseases,353,20

We successfully isolated a novel respirovirus from the lungs of a dead Malayan pangolin. Similar to murine respirovirus, the full-length genome of this novel virus was 15â384 nucleotides comprising six genes in the order 3'-(leader)-NP-P-M-F-HN-l-(trailer)-5'. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that this virus belongs to the genus Respirovirus and is most closely related to murine respirovirus. Notably, animal infection experiments indicated that the pangolin virus is highly pathogenic and transmissible in mice, with inoculated mice having variable clinical symptoms and a fatality rate of 70.37â%. The virus was found to replicate in most tissues with the exception of muscle and heart. Contact transmission of the virus was 100â% efficient, although the mice in the contact group displayed milder symptoms, with the virus mainly being detected in the trachea and lungs.

Despite a series of public education reforms and efforts by scientific researchers, scientific literacy and passion remain sparse across the American public. In fact, many students demonstrate a lack of interest in the sciences as early as first grade, with major drop-offs occurring by the age of 14. This is further exacerbated for youth of color, as science is deeply rooted in pervasive and institutionalized racism. When accessible, out-of-school science experiences are uniquely positioned to promote youth agency, leverage students' current values, and challenge structural inequities. Therefore, this work sought to highlight the narratives of three young science learners who identify as youth of color and graduated from an eight-year-long museum science program. A narrative inquiry was implemented, guided by Critical Race Theory and Cultural Learning Pathways as frameworks. Data from semi-structured interviews, questionnaires, and drawings provided insight into the students' orientations towards science and the development of those orientations. The study took place during the Covid-19 outbreak. Implications of the pandemic on the study are discussed. Findings from the study suggest that students positively identify with science and feel at home in The Museum. It was also noticed, however, that the students maintained ideologies consistent with Western perspectives. Recommendations include creating homeplaces, making out-of-school learning more easily accessible, and creating justice-centered curricula.

However, it is poorly understood how T-cell dysregulation can contribute to the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19. Here we show single cell-level mechanisms for T-cell dysregulation in severe COVID-19, demonstrating new pathogenetic mechanisms of T-cell activation and differentiation underlying severe COVID-19. By in silico sorting CD4+ T-cells from a single cell RNA-seq dataset, we found that CD4+ T-cells were highly activated and showed unique differentiation pathways in the lung of severe COVID-19 patients. Notably, those T-cells in severe COVID-19 patients highly expressed immunoregulatory receptors and CD25, whilst repressing the expression of FOXP3. Furthermore, we show that CD25+ hyperactivated T-cells differentiate into multiple helper T-cell lineages, showing multifaceted effector T-cells with Th1 and Th2 characteristics. Lastly, we show that CD25-expressing hyperactivated T-cells produce the protease Furin, which facilitates the viral entry of SARS-CoV-2. Collectively, CD4+ T-cells from severe COVID-19 patients are hyperactivated and FOXP3-mediated negative feedback mechanisms are impaired in the lung, which may promote immunopathology. Therefore, our study proposes a new model of T-cell hyperactivation and paralysis that drives immunopathology in severe COVID-19.","Kalfaoglu, Bahire; Almeida-Santos, José; Tye, Chanidapa Adele; Satou, Yorifumi; Ono, Masahiro",Front Immunol,353,16

Although the genetic sequences of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have high homology, the clinical and pathological characteristics of COVID-19 differ significantly from those of SARS. How and whether SARS-CoV-2 evades (cellular) immune surveillance requires further elucidation. In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to major histocompability complex class &#921; (MHC-&#921;) down-regulation both in vitro and in vivo. The viral protein encoded by open reading frame 8 (ORF8) of SARS-CoV-2, which shares the least homology with SARS-CoV among all viral proteins, directly interacts with MHC-&#921; molecules and mediates their down-regulation. In ORF8-expressing cells, MHC-&#921; molecules are selectively targeted for lysosomal degradation via autophagy. Thus, SARS-CoV-2-infected cells are much less sensitive to lysis by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Because ORF8 protein impairs the antigen presentation system, inhibition of ORF8 could be a strategy to improve immune surveillance.","Zhang, Yiwen; Chen, Yingshi; Li, Yuzhuang; Huang, Feng; Luo, Baohong; Yuan, Yaochang; Xia, Baijin; Ma, Xiancai; Yang, Tao; Yu, Fei; Liu, Jun; Liu, Bingfeng; Song, Zheng; Chen, Jingliang; Yan, Shumei; Wu, Liyang; Pan, Ting; Zhang, Xu; Li, Rong; Huang, Wenjing; He, Xin; Xiao, Fei; Zhang, Junsong; Zhang, Hui",Proc.

Emerging evidence suggests that the use of heparin in these patients could be associated with lower mortality. Emicizumab is a bispecific humanized monoclonal antibody that bridges activated factor IX and factor X, thereby restoring the function of missing factor VIIIa in hemophilia A. The use of emicizumab has been associated with thrombotic events in patients who also received high cumulative amounts of activated prothrombin complex concentrates. Although this risk is extremely low, there is a lack of evidence on whether CAC increases the thrombotic risk in patients on emicizumab prophylaxis. We present the case of a patient with severe hemophilia A in prophylaxis treatment with emicizumab; due to the potential thrombotic risk we decided to administer low molecular weight heparin as prophylaxis treatment without any thrombotic or bleeding complications.","Rivas-Pollmar, María Isabel; Álvarez-Román, María Teresa; Butta-Coll, Nora V; Martín Salces, Mónica; García-Barcenilla, Sara; Jiménez-Yuste, Victor",J. thromb. haemost,353,6

Limited data exist on its use in immediate breast reconstruction. We present our experience of day-case management of mastectomy with immediate pre-pectoral implant-based reconstruction (IBR). METHODS: Data were collected on 47 patients who underwent day-case skin-sparing (SSM) or nipple-sparing (NSM) mastectomy with pre-pectoral IBR between October 2017 and September 2019. Clinicopathological data were collected, including postoperative complications, re-admission and re-operation. The data were compared to published national standards. RESULTS: Median age was 52 years (range 37-74). Thirty-two patients (68%) had an SSM and 15 (32%) had an NSM. Two patients (4%) had risk-reducing mastectomies and 45 had treatment for invasive cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Mean tumour size was 33.3mm (range 7-85mm). Forty-two (89%) patients went home on the day of surgery. No patients required re-operation in the first 48 hours. The median postoperative follow-up time was 11.4 months (range 1.8-22.7 months). During the first 90-day postoperative period, eight patients (17%) developed superficial skin necrosis, five patients (10.6%) developed postoperative infections and five patients (10.6%) suffered an implant loss. Eight patients (17%) were readmitted for re-operation. Compared to UK national standards set in the iBRA study, our cohort has demonstrated comparable postoperative infection, implant loss and re-operation and re-admission rates. CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated close to 90% day-case success rate for mastectomy with IBR. These early data suggest that immediate IBR can be carried out in a manner that is cost-efficient without impacting surgical outcomes.","Shaker, H; Leena, Nar; Mayers, V; Koussa, F; Deshpande, A",Ann R Coll Surg Engl,353,16

We build on the pertinent literature that raises legal, ethical, economic and pedagogical implications of paid versus unpaid placement models and what motivates placement organizations to offer placements. Four interdisciplinary trans-Tasman case studies are discussed to better understand the complex situations for placement organizations and universities to sustain WIL placements during this pandemic. Conclusions include recommendations to be vigilant and ensure goodwill is not used to mask the exploitation of students, but rather, positively influence the motivation behind offering placements during these trying times and beyond.","Hoskyn, Katharine Eady Michelle J.; Capocchiano, Holly Lucas Patricia Rae Sally Trede Franziska Yuen Loletta",International Journal of Work - Integrated Learning,353,24

Global research efforts have focused on developing effective vaccines against COVID-19. However, some of the basic epidemiological parameters, such as the exponential epidemic growth rate and the basic reproductive number, R0, across geographic areas are still not well quantified. Here, we developed and fit a mathematical model to case and death count data collected from the United States and eight European countries during the early epidemic period before broad control measures were implemented. Results show that the early epidemic grew exponentially at rates between 0.18-0.29/day (epidemic doubling times between 2.4-3.9 days). We found that for such rapid epidemic growth, high levels of intervention efforts are necessary, no matter the goal is mitigation or containment. We discuss the current estimates of the mean serial interval, and argue that existing evidence suggests that the interval is between 6-8 days in the absence of active isolation efforts. Using parameters consistent with this range, we estimated the median R0 value to be 5.8 (confidence interval: 4.7-7.3) in the United States and between 3.6 and 6.1 in the eight European countries. We further analyze how vaccination schedules depend on R0, the duration of protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and show that individual-level heterogeneity in vaccine induced immunity can significantly affect vaccination schedules.","Ke, Ruian; Romero-Severson, Ethan; Sanche, Steven; Hengartner, Nick",J Theor Biol,353,16

Medical staff usually refer to the results of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction tests in conjunction with clinical symptoms and computed tomographic images. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 62-year-old Japanese man who twice had positive and negative test results by polymerase chain reaction for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 over 48 days of hospitalization, including in intensive care. His respiratory symptoms and computed tomographic imaging findings consistent with coronavirus disease 2019 improved following initial intensive care, and the result of his polymerase chain reaction test became negative 3 days before discharge from the intensive care unit. However, 4 days after this first negative result, his polymerase chain reaction test result was positive again, and another 4 days later, he had a negative result once more. Eight days after the second polymerase chain reaction negative test result, the patient's test result again became positive. Finally, his polymerase chain reaction results were negative 43 days after his first hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: This case emphasizes the importance of repeat polymerase chain reaction testing and diagnosis based on multiple criteria, including clinical symptoms and computed tomographic imaging findings. Clinical staff should consider that a negative result by polymerase chain reaction does not necessarily certify complete coronavirus disease 2019 recovery.","Kanamoto, Masafumi; Tobe, Masaru; Takazawa, Tomonori; Saito, Shigeru",J Med Case Rep,353,28

This emphasis is based on the principles of the traditional Health Belief Model which is a commonly used model in global health systems. More recently, there has been a drive towards other health behaviour change models, like the COM-B model and Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW);nonetheless, these remain entrenched within the principles of individual health responsibility. However, the South African experience with the HIV epidemic serves as a backdrop to demonstrate that holding people personally accountable for health behaviour changes has major pitfalls;health risk is never objective and does not take place outside of subjective experience. This article makes the argument that risk-taking health behaviour change in the South African context has to consider community empowerment and capacity building.

METHODS: An online survey was administered to physicians licensed in New York State. RESULTS: Of the 164 physicians studied, 20.7% experienced severe distress during their first COVID-19 triage decisions. The mean distress score was not significantly different between physicians who received just-in-time training and those who did not (6.0 ± 2.7 vs 6.2 ± 2.8; P = 0.550) and between physicians who received clinical guidelines and those who did not (6.0 ± 2.9 vs 6.2 ± 2.7; P = 0.820). Substantially increased odds of severe distress were found in physicians who reported that their first COVID-19 triage decisions were inconsistent with their core values (adjusted odds ratio, 6.33; 95% confidence interval, 2.03-19.76) and who reported having insufficient skills and expertise (adjusted odds ratio 2.99, 95% confidence interval 0.91-9.87). CONCLUSION: Approximately 1 in 5 physicians in New York experienced severe distress during their first COVID-19 triage decisions. Physicians with insufficient skills and expertise, and core values misaligned to triage decisions are at heightened risk of experiencing severe distress. Just-in-time training and clinical guidelines do not appear to alleviate distress experienced by physicians during their first COVID-19 triage decisions.","Chou, Francisca L; Abramson, David; DiMaggio, Charles; Hoven, Christina W; Susser, Ezra; Andrews, Howard F; Chihuri, Stanford; Lang, Barbara H; Ryan, Megan; Herman, Daniel; Susser, Ida; Mascayano, Franco; Li, Guohua",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,353,13

The government's restriction measures have attenuated the burden on hospitals. The association of high viral replication with disease severity suggests the potential for lower viral load in milder clinical presentations. METHODS: The reverse-transcription-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) profile of 944 consecutive, non-replicate, positive retropharyngeal swabs was collected from 3 March to 8 June 2020 to investigate the temporal profile of SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the region of Capitanata, Apulia. Cycle threshold (Ct) values of 3 targets (N [nucleocapsid protein], E [envelope protein] and RdRP [RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase]) were analysed. RESULTS: The median Ct values of the 3 targets increased considerably over the study period, showing a progressive and constant weekly change. The negative detection rate of E and RdRP increased over time. These data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 viral load progressively decreased along the outbreak course. During the first epidemic peak (March and April) the viral load among patients >80-years was significantly higher than for younger subjects. However, in May this age-dependent difference disappeared, underlying viral load reduction in the elderly. CONCLUSIONS: An attenuation of viral transmission or pathogenicity during the epidemic course is suggested, likely due to restriction measures, although viral factors might also be considered.","Sangineto, Moris; Arena, Fabio; De Nittis, Rosella; Villani, Rosanna; Gallo, Crescenzio; Serviddio, Gaetano",Int J Infect Dis,353,21

Different aspects of the disease are still largely unknown. However, laboratory investigation and clinical course of the COVID-19 show that this new disease is not a typical acute respiratory distress syndrome process, especially during the first phase.

Sensitive measurement of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies would provide new insight into pre-existing immunity, virus transmission dynamics, and the nuances of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. To date, existing SARS-CoV-2 serology tests have limited utility due to insufficient reliable detection of antibody levels lower than what is typically present after several days of symptoms. To measure lower quantities of SARS-CoV-2 IgM, IgG, and IgA with higher resolution than existing assays, we developed a new ELISA protocol with a distinct plate washing procedure and timed plate development via use of a standard curve. Very low optical densities from samples added to buffer coated wells at as low as a 1:5 dilution are reported using this 'BU ELISA' method. Use of this method revealed circulating SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid protein (N) reactive antibodies (IgG, IgM, and/or IgA) in 44 and 100 percent of pre-pandemic subjects, respectively, and the magnitude of these antibodies tracked with antibody levels of analogous viral proteins from endemic coronavirus (eCoV) strains. The disease status (HIV, SLE) of unexposed subjects was not linked with SARS-CoV-2 reactive antibody levels; however, quantities were significantly lower in subjects over 70 years of age compared with younger counterparts. Also, we measured SARS-CoV-2 RBD- and N- specific IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies from 29 SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals at varying disease states, including 10 acute COVID-19 hospitalized subjects with negative serology results by the EUA approved Abbott IgG chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay. Measurements of SARS-CoV-2 RBD- and N- specific IgM, IgG, IgA levels measured by the BU ELISA revealed higher signal from 9 of the 10 Abbott test negative COVID-19 subjects than all pre-pandemic samples for at least one antibody specificity/isotype, implicating improved serologic identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection via multi-parameter, high sensitive antibody detection. We propose that this improved ELISA protocol, which is straightforward to perform, low cost, and uses readily available commercial reagents, is a useful tool to elucidate new information about SARS-CoV-2 infection and immunity and has promising implications for improved detection of all analytes measurable by this platform.","Yuen, Rachel R; Steiner, Dylan; Pihl, Riley M F; Chavez, Elizabeth; Olson, Alex; Smith, Erika L; Baird, Lillia A; Korkmaz, Filiz; Urick, Patricia; Sagar, Manish; Berrigan, Jacob L; Gummuluru, Suryaram; Corley, Ronald B; Quillen, Karen; Belkina, Anna C; Mostoslavsky, Gustavo; Rifkin, Ian R; Kataria, Yachana; Cappione, Amedeo J; Gao, Wenda; Lin, Nina H; Bhadelia, Nahid; Snyder-Cappione, Jennifer E",Front Immunol,353,16

Preventing and reversing the cytokine storm may be the key to save the patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been shown to possess a comprehensive powerful immunomodulatory function. This study aims to investigate whether MSC transplantation improves the outcome of 7 enrolled patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in Beijing YouAn Hospital, China, from Jan 23, 2020 to Feb 16, 2020. The clinical outcomes, as well as changes of inflammatory and immune function levels and adverse effects of 7 enrolled patients were assessed for 14 days after MSC injection. MSCs could cure or significantly improve the functional outcomes of seven patients without observed adverse effects. The pulmonary function and symptoms of these seven patients were significantly improved in 2 days after MSC transplantation. Among them, two common and one severe patient were recovered and discharged in 10 days after treatment. After treatment, the peripheral lymphocytes were increased, the C-reactive protein decreased, and the overactivated cytokine-secreting immune cells CXCR3+CD4+ T cells, CXCR3+CD8+ T cells, and CXCR3+ NK cells disappeared in 3-6 days. In addition, a group of CD14+CD11c+CD11bmidregulatory DC cell population dramatically increased. Meanwhile, the level of TNF-α was significantly decreased, while IL-10 increased in MSC treatment group compared to the placebo control group. Furthermore, the gene expression profile showed MSCs were ACE2- and TMPRSS2- which indicated MSCs are free from COVID-19 infection. Thus, the intravenous transplantation of MSCs was safe and effective for treatment in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, especially for the patients in critically severe condition.","Leng, Zikuan; Zhu, Rongjia; Hou, Wei; Feng, Yingmei; Yang, Yanlei; Han, Qin; Shan, Guangliang; Meng, Fanyan; Du, Dongshu; Wang, Shihua; Fan, Junfen; Wang, Wenjing; Deng, Luchan; Shi, Hongbo; Li, Hongjun; Hu, Zhongjie; Zhang, Fengchun; Gao, Jinming; Liu, Hongjian; Li, Xiaoxia; Zhao, Yangyang; Yin, Kan; He, Xijing; Gao, Zhengchao; Wang, Yibin; Yang, Bo; Jin, Ronghua; Stambler, Ilia; Lim, Lee Wei; Su, Huanxing; Moskalev, Alexey; Cano, Antonio; Chakrabarti, Sasanka; Min, Kyung-Jin; Ellison-Hughes, Georgina; Caruso, Calogero; Jin, Kunlin; Zhao, Robert Chunhua",Aging Dis.,353,20

With infections soaring rapidly, users took to Twitter asking people to self isolate and quarantine themselves. Users also demanded closure of schools, bars, and restaurants as well as lockdown of cities and states. We methodically collect tweets by identifying and tracking trending COVID-related hashtags. We first manually group the hashtags into six main categories, namely, 1) General COVID, 2) Quarantine, 3) Panic Buying, 4) School Closures, 5) Lockdowns, and 6) Frustration and Hope, and study the temporal evolution of tweets in these hashtags. We conduct a linguistic analysis of words common to all hashtag groups and specific to each hashtag group and identify the chief concerns of people as the pandemic gripped the nation (e.g., exploring bidets as an alternative to toilet paper). We conduct sentiment analysis and our investigation reveals that people reacted positively to school closures and negatively to the lack of availability of essential goods due to panic buying. We adopt a state-of-the-art semantic role labeling approach to identify the action words (e.g., fear, test), which capture the actions people are referring to in the tweets. We then leverage an LSTM-based dependency parsing model to analyze the context of the above-mentioned action words (e.g., verb deal is accompanied by nouns such as anxiety, stress, and crisis). Finally, we develop a scalable seeded topic modeling approach to automatically categorize and isolate tweets into hashtag groups and experimentally validate that our topic model provides a grouping similar to our manual grouping.

For people living with cancer, treatments are interrupted, surgeries cancelled, and regular oncology evaluations rescheduled. People with cancer and their physicians must balance plausible fears of coronavirus disease 2019 and cancer treatment with the consequences of delaying cancer care. OBJECTIVE: We aim to evaluate the experience of women with ovarian cancer during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. STUDY DESIGN: Women with a current or previous diagnosis of ovarian cancer completed an online survey focusing on treatment interruptions and quality of life. The quality of life was measured with the Cancer Worry Scale and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. The survey was distributed through survivor networks and social media. Univariate and multivariable linear regression analysis were used to evaluate the effect of participant characteristics on quality of life survey scores. RESULTS: A total of 603 women, from 41 states, visited the survey website between March 30, 2020, and April 13, 2020, and 555 (92.0%) completed the survey. The median age was 58 years (range, 20-85). At the time of survey completion, 217 participants (43.3%) were in active treatment. A total of 175 participants (33%) experienced a delay in some component of their cancer care. Ten (26.3%) of the 38 participants scheduled for surgery experienced a delay, as did 18 (8.3%) of the 217 participants scheduled for nonsurgical cancer treatment. A total of 133 participants (24.0%) had a delayed physician appointment, 84 (15.1%) laboratory tests, and 53 (9.6%) cancer-related imaging. Among the cohort, 88.6% (489) reported significant cancer worry, 51.4% (285) borderline or abnormal anxiety, and 26.5% (147) borderline or abnormal depression. On univariate analysis, age less than 65 years, being scheduled for cancer treatment or cancer surgery, delay in oncology care, being self-described as immunocompromised, and use of telemedicine were all associated with higher levels of cancer worry. Higher anxiety scores were associated with age less than 65 years and being self-described as immunocompromised. Higher depression scores were associated with age less than 65 years, being scheduled for cancer surgery, delay in oncology care, being self-described as immunocompromised, and use of telemedicine. On multivariable linear regression analysis, age less than 65 and being self-described as immunocompromised were independently predictive of greater cancer worry, anxiety, and depression, and delay in cancer care was predictive of anxiety and depression. CONCLUSION: The coronavirus disease 2019 crisis is affecting care of patients with ovarian cancer; surgeries, treatments, scheduled physician appointments, laboratory tests, and imaging are cancelled or delayed. Younger age, presumed immunocompromise, and delay in cancer care were associated with significantly higher levels of cancer worry, anxiety, and depression. Providers must work with patients to balance competing risks of coronavirus disease 2019 and cancer, recognizing that communication is a critical clinical tool to improve quality of life in these times.","Frey, Melissa K; Ellis, Annie E; Zeligs, Kristen; Chapman-Davis, Eloise; Thomas, Charlene; Christos, Paul J; Kolev, Valentin; Prasad-Hayes, Monica; Cohen, Samantha; Holcomb, Kevin; Blank, Stephanie V",Am J Obstet Gynecol,353,33

Alongside increased physical frailty, anxiety symptoms associated with the risk of SARS-CoV-2 contagion appear to represent its most prominent 'sequelae'. The attentional and linguistic resources required for decoding virus-related information may also influence the perceived threat of contagion. However, the possible role of neuropsychogeriatric factors on the latter dimension has never been assessed in a longitudinal study on the older population. To fill this gap, 50 healthy cognitively preserved older adults underwent a neuropsychological and physical frailty assessment before the pandemic (T0). Subsequently, they agreed to be interviewed and re-assessed during the lockdown (T1) and immediately after it (T2) through a longitudinal one-year study. Perceived threat of SARS-CoV-2 at T2 was predicted both by baseline anxiety and frailty scores, and by decreased performance in information processing speed and language comprehension tests.

To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of prevalence and mortality risk in COVID-19 patients with pre-existing dyslipidaemia. METHODS: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed in abstracting data and assessing validity. We searched MEDLINE and Scopus to locate all the articles published up to January 31, 2021, reporting data on dyslipidaemia among COVID-19 survivors and non-survivors. The pooled prevalence of dyslipidaemia was calculated using a random effects model and presenting the related 95% confidence interval (CI), while the mortality risk was estimated using the Mantel-Haenszel random effects models with odds ratio (OR) and related 95% CI. Statistical heterogeneity was measured using the Higgins I2 statistic. RESULTS: Eighteen studies, enrolling 74.132 COVID-19 patients [mean age 70.6 years], met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. The pooled prevalence of dyslipidaemia was 17.5% of cases (95% CI: 12.3-24.3%, p < 0.0001), with high heterogeneity (I2=98.7%). Pre-existing dyslipidaemia was significantly associated with higher risk of short-term death (OR: 1.69, 95% CI: 1.19-2.41, p = 0.003), with high heterogeneity (I2=88.7%). Due to publication bias, according to the Trim-and-Fill method, the corrected random-effect ORs resulted 1.61, 95% CI 1.13-2.28, p < 0.0001 (one studies trimmed). CONCLUSIONS: Dyslipidaemia represents a major comorbidity in about 18% of COVID-19 patients but it is associated with a 60% increase of short-term mortality risk.","Zuin, Marco; Rigatelli, Gianluca; Bilato, Claudio; Cervellati, Carlo; Zuliani, Giovanni; Roncon, Loris",QJM,353,1

METHODS: A prospective cohort study through a telephone survey was performed in 156 patients (143 for primary and 13 for revision) included in the TKR and RKR surgical waiting list before March 2020. Contact of each patient with COVID-19, stress and anxiety, perceived pain, and function were obtained in the interviews, and also the preference of each patient to have re-scheduled surgery (early or late). Finally, we registered their response (acceptance or refusal) when surgery was effectively re-scheduled. RESULTS: 88 out of 156 patients waiting for knee replacement (76/143 of those waiting for TKR, 12/13 of those waiting for RKR) declared themselves ready for surgery in less than 1 month. When re-scheduled, 115 patients underwent surgery and 41 refused. Significantly different preferences were found for age (more prone to surgery if under 65), revision surgery (more readily available), pain (7.9 ± 1.7/10 in NRS in those undergoing surgery, 5.6 ± 2.3/10 in those refusing, p = 0.000), or COVID-19 diagnosis, but not other close contact with COVID-19, comorbidities, stress, or anxiety. A logistic regression model confirmed that revision surgery (OR 9.33), perceived severe pain (OR 5.21), and age under 65 years (OR 5.82) were significantly associated with patient preference. The probability of patients over 65 to prefer early surgery reached 60% only with pain at or above 9/10. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical timing preferences for knee replacement vary between patients older than 65 years (immediate surgery only when pain is intense) and younger patients (immediate surgery no matter the amount of pain). Even if COVID-19 severely stroke our population, the need for knee replacement stood in the young population and even in the aged population at risk for COVID when pain was important.","Gómez-Barrena, Enrique; Rubio-Saez, Israel; Padilla-Eguiluz, Norma G; Hernandez-Esteban, Pablo",Knee surg. sports traumatol. arthrosc,353,16

The whole world is eagerly waiting for an effective antiviral therapy to combat COVID-19, but it is yet to get. The emergence of COVID-19 makes imperative the need for safe and potent antiviral drugs. Many metal nanoparticles exhibit significant antiviral potential against many viral diseases. The Ayurvedic system of medicine is the treasure of many metal nanoparticulate drugs termed as Bhasma. Recent findings: Gold, silver, copper, zinc and iron oxide nanoparticles are effective against coronavirus. A possible mechanism of action of the metal nanoparticles against coronavirus is a disruption of outer layers of coronavirus. Swarna Bhasma, Rajata Bhasma, Tamra Bhasma and Yashada Bhasma are recommended for COVID-19 treatment due to the ability to reduce the plasma interleukins, interferons and TNF&#945; levels. Summary: The Ayurvedic Bhasma preparations are unique metal nanoparticles. These metal nanoparticles are safe, stable in solid state and are having excellent biological activities. Ayurvedic metal nanoparticles, Swarna Bhasma, Rajata Bhasma, Tamra Bhasma and Yashada Bhasma could be proved as novel antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2 for their anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antiviral and adjuvant activities.","Sarkar, Prasanta Kumar; Das Mukhopadhyay, Chitrangada",Int Nano Lett,353,24

Method The authors initially developed these recommendations by adapting those developed for physical therapists working with patients with COVID-19 by Thomas et al. (2020). The recommendations then underwent review by 14 speech-language pathologists and rehabilitation-focused academics representing seven countries (Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, the United States). The authors consolidated and reviewed the feedback in order to decide what should be included or modified. Applicability to a global audience was intended throughout the document. Results The authors had 100% agreement on the elements of the recommendations that needed to be changed/modified or added. The final document includes recommendations for speech-language pathology workforce planning and preparation, caseload management, service delivery and documentation, as well as recommendations for the selection of appropriate personal protective equipment and augmentative and alternative communication equipment in the acute care hospital setting. Conclusions Speech-language pathologists play a critical role in the assessment, management, and treatment of patients with COVID-19. Several important considerations need to be made in order to meet the needs of this unique patient population.

Because the health diet plays an important role in our immune system, which is contributed to the defense of the virus and the recovery after the treatment, this study aims to determine the relationships between the protein quantity in food and COVID-19. To find the correlation between them, we decide to use a basic regression as an analyzing tool to deal with it. To find the relationship between the quantity of protein in diet and COVID-19, we did the investigation first to find a proper dataset and a proper machine learning model. We tried to explore and investigate whether the protein in food is related to the recovery and death rate of COVID-19. By analyzing the data, we found that there is almost no correlation between the two. It seems the quantity of the protein plays a small role in the recuperation of COVID-19, however, there are many other factors, such as other nutritional elements, people's age, gender, and their underlying disease types, etc., which all affect their recovery status of COVID-19.

In the 2010 US National Academies Decadal Survey of Astronomy (National Research Council, 2010), it was suggested that having to move so frequently which is a career necessity may be unattractive to people wanting to start a family, especially impacting women. Whether in Europe or elsewhere, as postdocs, astrophysicists will relocate every two to three years, until they secure a permanent position or leave research altogether. Astrophysicists do perceive working abroad as important and positive for their careers (Parenti, 2002); however, it was found that the men at equal rank had not had to spend as much time abroad to further their careers (Fohlmeister&Helling, 2012). By implication, women need to work abroad longer or have more positions abroad to achieve the same rank as men. Astrophysicists living in the United Kingdom prefer to work in their country of origin, but many did not do so because of worse working conditions or difficultly finding a job for their spouse (Fohlmeister&Helling, 2014). In sum, mobility and moving is necessary for a career in astrophysics, and even more necessary for women, but astrophysicists prefer not to move as frequently as needed to maintain a research career. To gather more data on these issues and to broaden the discourse beyond male/female to include the gender diverse as well as to include other forms of diversity, I designed the ASTROMOVES project which is funded through a Marie Curie Individual Fellowship.

Despite uncertainty, infection prevention principles and experience with similar diseases have helped guide how to best protect providers and patients against disease acquisition. RECENT FINDINGS: Guidance to date has relied on data from SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV to guide practices on patient isolation and personal protective equipment (PPE) use. Although a face mask and eye protection are likely adequate for most clinical scenarios, published guidelines for PPE can be confusing and conflicting. Consensus for what constitutes a high-risk aerosol-generating procedure (AGP) is lacking, but most agree providers performing procedures such as bronchoscopy, intubation, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation would likely benefit from the use of an N95 respirator and eye protection. SUMMARY: Needed research to elucidate the predominant SARS-CoV-2 mode of transmission is not likely to be completed in the immediate future. Recommendations for PPE to mitigate procedure-associated risk remain controversial. Nonetheless, implementation of existing measures based on basic infection prevention principles is likely to prevent transmission significantly.","Scaggs Huang, Felicia; Schaffzin, Joshua K",Curr Opin Pediatr,353,16

Interventions to address these conditions have been developed that span the T2 to T4 translational research spectrum ranging from the intrapsychic to population-based interventions. Policies ranging from standards of care to Medicare benefits have been implemented. A review of research in the area of diabetes and depression is provided as an example of innovations in this field. Behavior is the foundation of all interventions we make in diabetes and prediabetes. As a mature science, it is critical to stemming the tide of diabetes and its outcomes.

Materials and Methods: We conducted a retrospective, observational study using cross-sectional data for all 139 U.S. Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMCs). We used logistic regression analyses to identify factors that predicted whether a VAMC was in the top quartile of VA Video Connect (VVC) telehealth uptake for primary care and mental health care. Results: All 139 VAMCs increased their VVC uptake at least 2-fold early in the pandemic, with most increasing uptake between 5- and 10-fold. Pre-COVID-19, higher VVC uptake in primary care was weakly and positively associated with having more high-risk patients, negatively associated with having more long-distance patients, and positively associated with the prior fiscal year's VVC uptake. During COVID-19, the positive association with high-risk patients and the negative association with long-distance patients strengthened, while weaker broadband coverage was negatively associated with VVC uptake. For mental health care, having more long-distance patients was positively associated with higher VVC uptake pre-COVID-19, but this relationship reversed during COVID-19. Discussion: Despite the marked increase in VVC uptake early in the COVID-19 pandemic, significant VAMC-level variation indicates that VVC adoption was more difficult for some medical centers, particularly those with poorer broadband coverage and less prior VVC experience. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings highlight opportunities for medical centers, VA Central Office, and other federal entities to ensure equitable access to video telehealth.","Jacobs, Josephine; Ferguson, Jacqueline M; Van Campen, James; Yefimova, Maria; Greene, Liberty; Heyworth, Leonie; Zulman, Donna M",Telemed. j. e. health,353,16

The Chinese government has formulated effective response measures, and medical personnel have been actively responding to challenges associated with the epidemic prevention and control strategies. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of the implementation of a care transition pathway on patients that underwent joint replacement during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A quasi-experimental study was designed to evaluate the effect of implementing a care transition pathway for patients who underwent joint replacement during the COVID-19 pandemic in the orthopedic department of a tertiary care hospital in Beijing, China. Using a convenient sampling method, a total of 96 patients were selected. Of these, 51 patients who had undergone joint replacement in 2019 and received treatment via the routine nursing path were included in the control group. The remaining 45 patients who underwent joint replacement during the COVID-19 epidemic in 2020 and received therapy via the care transition pathway due to the implementation of epidemic prevention and control measures were included in the observation group. The quality of care transition was assessed by the Care Transition Measure (CTM), and patients were followed up 1 week after discharge. RESULTS: The observation group was determined to have better general self-care preparation, written planning materials, doctor-patient communication, health monitoring, and quality of care transition than the control group. CONCLUSIONS: A care transition pathway was developed to provide patients with care while transitioning through periods of treatment. It improved the patient perceptions of nursing quality. The COVID-19 pandemic is a huge challenge for health professionals, but we have the ability to improve features of workflows to provide the best possible patient care.","Xu, Ya-Ping; Zhao, Pei-Yu; Bai, Yi-Tong; Li, Shuang",J Orthop Surg Res,353,1

In this work, an alternative full-face mask is adapted from a modified snorkel mask to be used as PPE with two medical-grade filters and a 3D-printed adapter. Since the mask covers the eyes, mouth, and nose, it acts as a full-face shield, providing additional protection to healthcare workers. The SARS-CoV-2 has a size between 60 nm and 140 nm, and airborne viral particles can be carried by larger droplets with sizes up to several millimeters. The minimum filtration efficiency of mechanical and electrostatic filters is usually reached between 30 nm and 300 nm. The filtration efficiency of different medical filters is measured for particles below 300 nm to cover the size of the SARS-CoV-2 and small virus-laden droplets, and determine the minimum efficiency. The filtration performance of the adapted full-face mask is characterized using NaCl particles below 500 nm and different fitting scenarios to determine the minimum protection efficiency. The mask is compared to a commercial respirator and characterized according to the EN 149 standard, demonstrating that the protection fulfills the requirements for the FFP2 level (filtering face-piece 2, stopping at least 94% of airborne particles). The device shows a good resistance to several cycles of decontamination (autoclaving and ethanol immersion), is easy to be produced locally at low cost, and helps to address the shortage in FFP2 masks and face shields by providing adequate protection to healthcare workers against particles <500 nm in size.","Schmitt, Jean; Jones, Lewis S; Aeby, Elise A; Gloor, Christian; Moser, Berthold; Wang, Jing",Chem Res Toxicol,353,1

We investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on acute stroke care quality and clinical outcomes to detect healthcare system's bottlenecks from a territorial point of view. METHODS: Crossed-data analysis between a prospective nation-based mandatory registry of acute stroke, Emergency Medical System (EMS) records, and daily incidence of COVID-19 in Catalonia (Spain). We included all stroke code activations during the pandemic (March 15-May 2, 2020) and an immediate prepandemic period (January 26-March 14, 2020). Primary outcomes were stroke code activations and reperfusion therapies in both periods. Secondary outcomes included clinical characteristics, workflow metrics, differences across types of stroke centers, correlation analysis between weekly EMS alerts, COVID-19 cases, and workflow metrics, and impact on mortality and clinical outcome at 90 days. RESULTS: Stroke code activations decreased by 22% and reperfusion therapies dropped by 29% during the pandemic period, with no differences in age, stroke severity, or large vessel occlusion. Calls to EMS were handled 42 min later, and time from onset to hospital arrival increased by 53 min, with significant correlations between weekly COVID-19 cases and more EMS calls (rho = 0.81), less stroke code activations (rho = -0.37), and longer prehospital delays (rho = 0.25). Telestroke centers were afflicted with higher reductions in stroke code activations, reperfusion treatments, referrals to endovascular centers, and increased delays to thrombolytics. The independent odds of death increased (OR 1.6 [1.05-2.4], p 0.03) and good functional outcome decreased (mRS &#8804;2 at 90 days: OR 0.6 [0.4-0.9], p 0.015) during the pandemic period. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, Catalonia's stroke system's weakest points were the delay to EMS alert and a decline of stroke code activations, reperfusion treatments, and interhospital transfers, mostly at local centers. Patients suffering an acute stroke during the pandemic period had higher odds of poor functional outcome and death. The complete stroke care system's analysis is crucial to allocate resources appropriately.","Ramos-Pachón, Anna; García-Tornel, Álvaro; Millán, Mònica; Ribó, Marc; Amaro, Sergi; Cardona, Pere; Martí-Fàbregas, Joan; Roquer, Jaume; Silva, Yolanda; Ustrell, Xavier; Purroy, Francisco; Gómez-Choco, Manuel; Zaragoza-Brunet, José; Cánovas, David; Krupinski, Jurek; Sala, Natalia Mas; Palomeras, Ernest; Cocho, Dolores; Redondo, Laura; Repullo, Carmen; Sanjurjo, Eduardo; Carrión, Dolors; López, Mercè; Almendros, M Cruz; Barceló, Miquel; Monedero, Jordi; Catena, Esther; Rybyeba, Maria; Diaz, Gloria; Jiménez-Fàbrega, Xavier; Solà, Silvia; Hidalgo, Verónica; Pueyo, Maria Jesus; Pérez de la Ossa, Natàlia; Urra, Xabier",Cerebrovasc Dis,353,6

This rapid review aims to provide evidence syntheses as a means to complement the current evidence on the vaccine effectiveness (VE) against various outcomes in real-world settings. MethodsThis review is conducted based on the updated guideline of PRISMA 2020. Databases (PubMed, EMBASE, and MedRxiv) were searched up to 30 June 2021, (PROSPERO ID: 266866). The studies that assessed the VE of the 6 WHO-authorized vaccines (BNT162b2, ChAdOx1, Ad26.COV2.S, mRNA-1273, BBIBP-CorV, and CoronaVac) were eligible to be included. Quality assessment was performed based on ROBINS-I by 2 independent reviewers. FindingsA total of 39 studies were included, covering over 15 million of participants from 11 nations. Among the general population after 2 doses of vaccination, the VE against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was estimated at 89%-97%, 92% (95% CI, 78%-97%) and 94% (95% CI, 86%-97%) for BNT162b2, ChAdOx1 and mRNA-1273, respectively.

Methods: A survey questionnaire was developed and sent to 1,537 editors and staff of Asian scientific journals from July 13 to 19, 2020. The items gathered information on participants' general characteristics, changes in daily life, changes in work life, anticipated future changes, and suggestions in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Of the 152 respondents (response rate, 9.7%), most were editors. Fifty-seven respondents (37.5%) felt very or extremely anxious about the COVID-19 pandemic, and 101 (68.4%) reported spending more time on the internet. The workload of editing, reviewing, and publishing had increased for about one-third of respondents (34.2%, n=52). Forty-four respondents (28.9%) said that the number of submissions had increased. Of the 68 editors who had received manuscripts on COVID-19, 30 (44.1%) prioritized them. Most respondents (73.7%, n=112) predicted that online-only journal publishing would expand after the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion: COVID-19 appears to be a source of anxiety to editors, which may be related to the increased time they spend on the internet. Some editors reported an increased workload.

Scientific objectives of BASIL focus on characterizing biochemical activities of proteins with known structure and unknown function. BASIL curriculum (freely available on GitHub https://basilbiochem.github.io/basil/) includes modules on computational predictions of protein function, protein purification, and analysis of biochemical activity and kinetics. Three main challenges for our implementation included 1) scaling of research training from the ?apprentice? model to the classroom, 2) alignment of course learning objectives, activities and assessments with research goals to create optimal conditions for productive struggle, 3) student buy-in. To understand if/how students in our course develop laboratory research skills, we began assessing anticipated learning outcomes, focusing on students? evaluation of protein purification experiments. Initial assessment results revealed learning difficulties and led to modifications in instructional activities, including use of simulated experiments. The BASIL curriculum was intentionally designed to provide flexibility in its use in terms of sequencing and scope of experiments, content, and focus to meet desired course learning objectives. This flexibility proved beneficial in maintaining learning objectives when switching from the traditional lab format to online or hybrid delivery necessitated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a combination of lecture and video based explanations students were able to investigate their protein of interest completely online. Students working in this format reported gains in knowledge, experience and confidence. We did find that these gains were more pronounced in the bioinformatic experiments and concepts than about their wet-lab counterparts. In order to address these gaps in understanding interactive online resources are under current development by the BASIL team. In addition to addressing the short-term need for a set of coordinated electronic materials for biochemistry laboratory courses, this adaptation of the BASIL curriculum provides a meaningful distance-learning alternative in future years and may serve as a platform to broaden access to quality STEM education to more diverse student populations well after the pandemic has past.","Sikora, Arthur Craig Paul Goodman Anya Hall Bonnie Jones Eric Roberts Rebecca Pikaart Michael",The FASEB Journal,353,13

This foodborne illness, which reportedly most likely originated in a seafood market where wild animals are sold illegally, has transmitted among humans through close contact, across the world. The aim of this study is to explore health/risk perceptions of and attitudes toward healthy/risky food in the immediate context of food crisis. More specifically, by using the data collected from 1008 respondents in January 2020, the time when China was hit hard by the ""Corona Virus Disease 2019"" (COVID-19), this study investigates the overall and different generational respondents' health/risk perceptions of and attitudes toward organic food and game meat. The results reveal that, firstly, based on their food health and risk perceptions of healthy and risky food, the respondents' general attitudes are positive toward organic food but relatively negative toward game meat. Secondly, older generations have a more positive attitude and are more committed to organic food. Younger generations' attitude toward game meat is more negative whereas older generations attach more importance to it because of its nutritional and medicinal values. In addition, this research also indicates that the COVID-19 crisis influences the respondents' perceptions of and attitudes toward organic food and game meat consumption. However, the likelihood of its impact on older generations' future change in diets is smaller, which implies that older generations' food beliefs are more stable.","Xie, Xiaoru; Huang, Liman; Li, Jun Justin; Zhu, Hong",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),353,24

The purpose of this study was to examine how people in Canada who gave birth during the pandemic were affected by policies aimed at limiting interpersonal contact to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission in hospital and during the early weeks postpartum. METHODS: We took a social constructionist approach and used a qualitative descriptive methodology. Sampling methods were purposive and involved a mix of convenience and snowball sampling via social media and email. Study inclusion was extended to anyone aged 18 years or more who was located in Canada and was pregnant or had given birth during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were obtained via semistructured qualitative telephone interviews conducted between June 2020 and January 2021, and were analyzed through thematic analysis. RESULTS: Sixty-five interviews were conducted; data from 57 women who had already delivered were included in our analysis. We identified the following 4 themes: negative postpartum experience in hospital owing to the absence of a support person(s); poor postpartum mental health, especially in women with preexisting mental health conditions and those who had had medically complicated deliveries; asking for help despite public health regulations that prohibited doing so; and problems with breastfeeding owing to limited in-person follow-up care and lack of in-person breastfeeding support. INTERPRETATION: Policies that restrict the presence of support persons in hospital and at home during the postpartum period appear to be causing harm. Measures to mitigate the consequences of these policies could include encouraging pregnant people to plan for additional postpartum support, allowing a support person to remain for the entire hospital stay and offering additional breastfeeding support.","Rice, Kathleen; Williams, Sarah",CMAJ Open,353,20

Wearing a mask is a straightforward action that can be taken, but shortage of stock and equity of allocation were important issues in Taiwan. Furthermore, increased anxiety leading to the stockpiling of masks has been common during the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: We aim to summarize the name-based mask rationing plan implemented in Taiwan and explore the public's perceived anxiety about mask shortages. METHODS: The government of Taiwan took action to control the supply and allocation of face masks. We summarize the timeline and important components of the mask rationing plan. A survey that aimed to investigate the overall response to the mask rationing plan was answered by 44 participants. RESULTS: The mask rationing plan was implemented in late January 2020. Daily production capacity was increased from 2 million masks to 16 million masks in April 2020. People could buy 9 masks in 14 days by verification via their National Health Insurance card. Digital face mask availability maps were created. Moreover, the mask plan safeguarded the purchase of masks and resulted in decreased anxiety about a mask shortage (4.05 [SD 1.15] points; 72.7% [n=32] of participants answered ""agree"" or ""strongly agree""). The majority of people felt that the mask plan was satisfactory (4.2 [SD 0.92] points; 79.5% [n=35] of participants answered ""agree"" or ""strongly agree""). CONCLUSIONS: We found that the unique name-based mask rationing plan allowed for control of the production and supply of masks, and contributed to the appropriate allocation of masks. The mask rationing plan not only provided the public with physical protection, but also resulted in reduced anxiety about mask shortages during the pandemic.","Tai, Yu-Lin; Chi, Hsin; Chiu, Nan-Chang; Tseng, Cheng-Yin; Huang, Ya-Ning; Lin, Chien-Yu",JMIR Form Res,353,16

These matrices play various roles in order to maintain skin homeostasis and integrity. Within this complex interplay of cells and matrices, cell surface receptors play essential roles not only for inside-out and outside-in signaling, but also for establishing mechanical and biochemical properties of skin. Already minor modulations of this multifactorial cross-talk can lead to severe and systemic diseases.

DESIGN: Literature review. SETTING: Two literature loving households in England. PARTICIPANTS: George Kranky and grandma Kranky. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical and toxic effects of the individual ingredients checked against those listed in ToxBase, the National Poisons Information Service's poisons database. RESULTS: The medicine contained 34 ingredients. The most common toxic effect identified on ToxBase was nausea and vomiting (16 ingredients, 47%). Potentially life threatening effects were associated with 13 (38%) ingredients, including depression of the central nervous system, kidney injury, convulsions, cardiac toxicity, and mucosal erosion. The effects described in the book were accurate initially but then diverted from the most likely clinical outcome (death). CONCLUSIONS: Although Dahl ought to be applauded for his initial accuracy about the toxicology of the ingredients in George's marvellous medicine, the overall effect would be fatal catastrophic physiological collapse.

Presently, this has been applied for modelling the tertiary structure of highly conserved eukaryotic TCTP (translationally controlled tumour protein) which is involved in a plethora of functions during growth and development and also acts as a biomarker for many cancers like lung, breast, and prostate cancer. The modelled TCTP structures of different organisms belonging to the eukaryotic group showed similar spatial arrangement of structural units except loops and similar patterns of root mean square deviation (RMSD), root mean square fluctuation, and radius of gyration (Rg) inspected through molecular dynamics simulations. Essential dynamics (ED) analyses revealed different domains that exhibited different motions for the assistance in its multifunctional properties. Construction of a free-energy landscape (FEL) based on Rg versus RMSD was employed to characterize the folding behaviours of structures and observe that all proteins had nearly similar conformation and topologies, indicating common thermodynamic/kinetic pathways. A physico-chemical interaction study demonstrated the helices and sheets were well stabilized with ample amounts of bonding compared to turns or loops and charged residues were more accessible to solvent molecules. Hence, the current study reveals the important structural features of TCTP that aid in diverse functions in a wide range of organisms, thus extending our knowledge of TCTP and also providing a venue for designing the potent inhibitors against it.","Kumar, Rakesh; Saran, Shweta",J Mol Model,353,16

METHODS: Medline/Pubmed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases. In addition, the records in PROSPERO and Epistemonikos and PEDro were consulted. Systematic reviews of different conditions, populations and contexts, where the intervention to be evaluated is telerehabilitation by physical therapy were included. The outcomes were clinical effectiveness depending on specific condition, functionality, quality of life, satisfaction, adherence and safety. Data extraction and risk of bias assessment were carried out by a reviewer with non-independent verification by a second reviewer. The findings are reported qualitatively by tables and figures. RESULTS: Fifty-three systematic reviews were included of which 17 were assessed as having low risk of bias. Fifteen reviews were on cardiorespiratory rehabilitation, 14 on musculoskeletal conditions and 13 on neurorehabilitation. Other 11 reviews addressed other types of conditions and rehabilitation. Thirteen reviews evaluated with low risk of bias showed results in favor of telerehabilitation versus in-person rehabilitation or no-rehabilitation, while 17 reported no differences between the groups. Thirty-five reviews with unclear or high risk of bias showed mixed results. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the contradictory results, telerehabilitation in physical therapy could be comparable to in-person rehabilitation or better than no-rehabilitation for conditions such as osteoarthritis, low back pain, hip and knee replacement, multiple sclerosis, and also in the context of cardiac and pulmonary rehabilitation. It is imperative to conduct better quality clinical trials and systematic reviews. IMPACT: Providing with the best available evidence on the effectiveness of telerehabilitation to professionals, mainly physical therapists, will impact the decision-making process and therefore better clinical outcomes for patients, both in these times of covid-19 pandemic and in the future. The identification of research gaps will also contribute to the generation of relevant and novel research questions.","Seron, P; Oliveros, M J; Gutierrez-Arias, R; Fuentes-Aspe, R; Torres-Castro, R; Merino-Osorio, C; Nahuelhual, P; Inostroza, J; Jalil, Y; Solano, R; Marzuca-Nassr, G; Aguilera, R; Lavados-Romo, P; Soto, F; Sabelle, C; Villarroel, G; Gomolán, P; Huaiquilaf, S; Sanchez, P",Phys. ther,353,24

A counterview,18.720211,5.21226,2020,"BACKGROUND AND AIMSBACKGROUND: Currently there is limited knowledge on cancer and COVID-19; we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the impact of cancer on serious events including ICU admission rate and mortality in COVID 19. METHODS: PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials were searched on April 16, 2020, to extract published articles that reported the outcomes of cancer in COVID-19 patients. The search terms were ""coronavirus"" and ""clinical characteristics"" with no language or time restrictions. We identified 512 published results and 13 studies were included in the analysis. RESULTS: There were 3775 patients, of whom 63 (1·66%) had a cancer. The pooled estimates of ICU admission in COVID 19 patients with and without cancer were 40% versus 8·42%.The odds ratio of ICU admission rates between the cancer and non-cancer groups was 2.88 with a 95% CI of 1·18 to 7·01 (p = 0·026). The pooled estimates of death rate in COVID -19 patients with and without cancer were 20·83% versus 7·82%. The odds ratio of death rates between the cancer and non-cancer groups was 2.25 with a 95% CI ranging from 0·71 to 7·10 with p value of 0·166. The pooled prevalence of cancer patients was 2% (95 CI 1-4). CONCLUSIONS: Presence of cancer in COVID-19 leads to higher risk of developing serious events i.e. ICU admission, mechanical ventilation and mortality.

How sequence variations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome affect pathogenicity is poorly understood. Starting in October 2020, using the methodology of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we looked at the association between whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data of the virus and COVID-19 mortality as a potential method of early identification of highly pathogenic strains to target for containment. Although continuously updating our analysis, in December 2020, we analyzed 7548 single-stranded SARS-CoV-2 genomes of COVID-19 patients in the GISAID database and associated variants with mortality using a logistic regression. In total, evaluating 29,891 sequenced loci of the viral genome for association with patient/host mortality, two loci, at 12,053 and 25,088 bp, achieved genome-wide significance (p values of 4.09e-09 and 4.41e-23, respectively), though only 25,088 bp remained significant in follow-up analyses. Our association findings were exclusively driven by the samples that were submitted from Brazil (p value of 4.90e-13 for 25,088 bp). The mutation frequency of 25,088 bp in the Brazilian samples on GISAID has rapidly increased from about 0.4 in October/December 2020 to 0.77 in March 2021. Although GWAS methodology is suitable for samples in which mutation frequencies varies between geographical regions, it cannot account for mutation frequencies that change rapidly overtime, rendering a GWAS follow-up analysis of the GISAID samples that have been submitted after December 2020 as invalid. The locus at 25,088 bp is located in the P.1 strain, which later (April 2021) became one of the distinguishing loci (precisely, substitution V1176F) of the Brazilian strain as defined by the Centers for Disease Control. Specifically, the mutations at 25,088 bp occur in the S2 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which plays a key role in viral entry of target host cells. Since the mutations alter amino acid coding sequences, they potentially imposing structural changes that could enhance viral infectivity and symptom severity. Our analysis suggests that GWAS methodology can provide suitable analysis tools for the real-time detection of new more transmissible and pathogenic viral strains in databases such as GISAID, though new approaches are needed to accommodate rapidly changing mutation frequencies over time, in the presence of simultaneously changing case/control ratios. Improvements of the associated metadata/patient information in terms of quality and availability will also be important to fully utilize the potential of GWAS methodology in this field.","Hahn, Georg; Wu, Chloe M; Lee, Sanghun; Lutz, Sharon M; Khurana, Surender; Baden, Lindsey R; Haneuse, Sebastien; Qiao, Dandi; Hecker, Julian; DeMeo, Dawn L; Tanzi, Rudolph E; Choudhary, Manish C; Etemad, Behzad; Mohammadi, Abbas; Esmaeilzadeh, Elmira; Cho, Michael H; Li, Jonathan Z; Randolph, Adrienne G; Laird, Nan M; Weiss, Scott T; Silverman, Edwin K; Ribbeck, Katharina; Lange, Christoph",Genetic epidemiology,353,26

However, the bioactivity of microalgal lipids for anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic activities have rarely been investigated. Therefore, for a sustainable source of the above bioactive lipids, the present study was undertaken. The total lipids of microalga Chlorococcum sp., isolated from the Irish coast, were fractionated into neutral-, glyco-, and phospho-lipids, and were tested in vitro for their anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic activities. All tested lipid fractions showed strong anti-platelet-activating factor (PAF) and antithrombin activities in human platelets (half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values ranging ~25-200 µg of lipid) with the highest activities in glyco- and phospho-lipid fractions. The structural analysis of the bioactive lipid fraction-2 revealed the presence of specific sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerols (SQDG) bioactive molecules and the HexCer-t36:2 (t18:1/18:1 and 18:2/18:0) cerebrosides with a phytosphingosine (4-hydrosphinganine) base, while fraction-3 contained bioactive phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) molecules.

METHODS: Two hundred twenty infants (440 ears) were examined through AEP test once, and 47 (94 ears) of them went back for a second examination and were diagnosed with viral meningitis. The first AEP tests were compared with the second results in 47 infants. I latency, V latency, I-III interpeak latency (IPL), and III-V IPL were checked. RESULTS: In the first AEP test conducted on 440 ears, the average values of I and V latency and I-III IPL were delayed as compared with normal values. The second AEP results were conducted on 47 infants 92.36 days after the first exam. I latency and V latency of second exam were improved significantly (p < 0.05), but I-III and III-V IPL showed no significant changes. Two hearing impaired patients (4 ears) were confirmed through chart reviews. CONCLUSION: The AEP test is a helpful study for early detection of hearing problem. However, in this study, AEP test was too sensitive in acute period, and later, the incidence rate of hearing impairment was relatively low. Therefore, age of onset, severity of neurologic symptom, and clinical examination must be considered before the AEP test.","Kim, Howard; Kim, Mi Woon; Nam, Du Hyeon; Kang, Eun Young; Yang, Hoe Saeng",Childs nerv. syst,353,16

Samples from bovine faeces, feedstuffs, bulk tank milk, drinking water and soil from the entry and exit pens of the milking parlour were collected for bacteriological studies. PCR assays were used to confirm species and determine the serotype profile of L. monocytogenes isolates. AscI-pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was done to genetically compare them. Listeria spp. were isolated from eight of ten dairy farms, whereas L. monocytogenes in three of them. Serotype distribution in L. monocytogenes was as follows: 1/2a, three isolates; 4b, one isolate. L. monocytogenes or L. innocua excreted from clinically healthy milking cows was detected via faeces. In feedstuffs, only one L. monocytogenes 1/2a isolate from a pasture was obtained.

Therefore, there is great concern about susceptibility to the outcome of COVID-19-infected patients with MM. This retrospective study describes the baseline characteristics and outcome data of COVID-19 infection in 650 patients with plasma cell disorders, collected by the International Myeloma Society to understand the initial challenges faced by myeloma patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Analyses were performed for hospitalized MM patients. Among hospitalized patients, the median age was 69 years, and nearly all patients (96%) had MM. Approximately 36% were recently diagnosed (2019-2020), and 54% of patients were receiving first-line therapy. Thirty-three percent of patients have died, with significant geographic variability, ranging from 27% to 57% of hospitalized patients. Univariate analysis identified age, International Staging System stage 3 (ISS3), high-risk disease, renal disease, suboptimal myeloma control (active or progressive disease), and 1 or more comorbidities as risk factors for higher rates of death. Neither history of transplant, including within a year of COVID-19 diagnosis, nor other anti-MM treatments were associated with outcomes. Multivariate analysis found that only age, high-risk MM, renal disease, and suboptimal MM control remained independent predictors of adverse outcome with COVID-19 infection. The management of MM in the era of COVID-19 requires careful consideration of patient- and disease-related factors to decrease the risk of acquiring COVID-19 infection, while not compromising disease control through appropriate MM treatment. This study provides initial data to develop recommendations for the management of MM patients with COVID-19 infection.","Chari, Ajai; Samur, Mehmet Kemal; Martinez-Lopez, Joaquin; Cook, Gordon; Biran, Noa; Yong, Kwee; Hungria, Vania; Engelhardt, Monika; Gay, Francesca; García Feria, Ana; Oliva, Stefania; Oostvogels, Rimke; Gozzetti, Alessandro; Rosenbaum, Cara; Kumar, Shaji; Stadtmauer, Edward A; Einsele, Hermann; Beksac, Meral; Weisel, Katja; Anderson, Kenneth C; Mateos, María-Victoria; Moreau, Philippe; San-Miguel, Jesus; Munshi, Nikhil C; Avet-Loiseau, Hervé",Blood,353,20

We aimed to assess the impact of COVID on acute stroke clinical trial conduct at sites that continued to enroll patients during the pandemic. BEST-MSU is an ongoing study of Mobile Stroke Units (MSU) vs standard management of tPA-eligible acute stroke patients in the pre-hospital setting. MSU personnel include a vascular neurologist via telemedicine, and a nurse, CT technologist, paramedics and emergency medicine technicians on-board. During COVID, consent, 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and EQ5D were obtained by phone instead of in-person, but other aspects of management were similar to the pre-COVID period. We compared patient demographics, study metrics, and infection of study personnel during intra- vs pre-COVID eras. Five of 6 BEST-MSU sites continued to enroll during COVID. There were no differences in intra- (n = 57) vs pre- (n = 869) COVID enrolled tPA eligible patients' age, sex, race (38.6% vs 38.0% Black), ethnicity (15.8% vs 18.6% Hispanic), or NIHSS (median 11 vs 9). The percent of screened patients enrolled and adjudicated tPA eligible declined from 13.6% to 6.6% (p < .001); study enrollment correlated with local stay-at-home and reopening orders. There were no differences in alert to MSU arrival or arrival to tPA times, but MSU on-scene time was 5 min longer (p = .01). There were no differences in ED door to CT, tPA treatment or thrombectomy puncture times, hospital length of stay, discharge disposition, or remote vs in-person 90-day mRS or EQ5D.

Discussion: A 49-year-old female without any prior history of thyroid dysfunction presented with clinical and biochemical hyperthyroidism after a diagnosis of COVID-19 illness four months ago. At the time of thyroiditis diagnosis: free T4 was 1.52 ng/dL (normal, 0.76-1.46 ng/dL), TSH &amp;lt;0.005 uIU/mL (normal, 0.358-3.74 uIU/mL), Thyroglobulin antibodies 2 IU/mL (normal, &amp;lt;=1 IU/mL), TPO antibody 1 IU/mL (normal, &amp;lt;9 IU/mL), ESR 5 mm/hr (normal, 0-20 mm/hr). Thyroid US showed no nodules or evidence of autoimmune thyroid disease or abnormal vascular flow. A radioactive iodine uptake test was performed through the primary care office. The test demonstrated symmetric, uniform radiotracer uptake in the right and left lobe. 24-hour uptake was low at 0.1% (normal 15-25%) indicating thyroiditis. Patient features consistent with the diagnosis of subacute thyroiditis include suppressed TSH, diffuse tenderness on thyroid palpation, absent TPO/TG antibodies, and suppressed I-123 RAI uptake (&amp;lt;1%) on 24-hour scan. Conclusion: There is limited data surrounding thyroid disease and COVID-19. It has been suggested that a possible sequela of COVID-19 is thyroiditis.

The Maslach questionnaire was implemented in cardiology residents of an institution of the City of Buenos Aires, in the month of September 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic and the results were compared with those prospectively collected in the same population during September of 2019. The survey was anonymous. The questionnaire was responded by 39 residents (2019: 16; 2020: 23). Burnout was observed in 30% (nâ¯=â¯7) in 2019, and in 39% (9%) residents during the COVID-19 pandemic (P= 0.77).

The World Health Organization (WHO) is working with health partners on the rollout and implementation of a robust electronic field data collection platform. The delay in the deployment and rollout of this electronic platform in the WHO African Region, as a consequence of the application of large-scale public health and social measures including movement restrictions and geographical area quarantine, left a gap between data collection and management. This lead to the need to develop interim data management solutions to accurately monitor the evolution of the pandemic and support the deployment of appropriate public health interventions. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to review the design, development, and implementation of the COVID-19 Data Summarization and Visualization (DSV) tool as a rapidly deployable solution to fill this critical data collection gap as an interim solution. METHODS: This paper reviews the processes undertaken to research and develop a tool to bridge the data collection gap between the onset of a COVID-19 outbreak and the start of data collection using a prioritized electronic platform such as Go.Data in the WHO African Region. RESULTS: In anticipation of the implementation of a prioritized tool for field data collection, the DSV tool was deployed in 18 member states for COVID-19 outbreak data management. We highlight preliminary findings and lessons learned from the DSV tool deployment in the WHO African Region. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a rapidly deployable tool for COVID-19 data collection and visualization in the WHO African Region. The lessons drawn on this experience offer an opportunity to learn and apply these to improve future similar public health informatics initiatives in an outbreak or similar humanitarian setting, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.","Ahmed, Kamran; Bukhari, Muhammad Arish; Mlanda, Tamayi; Kimenyi, Jean Paul; Wallace, Polly; Okot Lukoya, Charles; Hamblion, Esther L; Impouma, Benido",JMIR Public Health Surveill,353,21

Strict adherence to COVID-19 protection measures is necessary. Alternative ways of consultations (telephone, video) should be used. Early discussion with regional/national experts about investigation and management of potential and existing patients is strongly encouraged. Patients with moderate or severe clinical features need urgent investigation and management. Patients with active Cushing's syndrome, especially when severe, are immunocompromised and vigorous adherence to the principles of social isolation is recommended. In patients with mild features or in whom a diagnosis is less likely, clinical re-evaluation should be repeated at 3 and 6 months or deferred until the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 has significantly decreased; however, those individuals should be encouraged to maintain social distancing. Diagnostic pathways may need to be very different from usual recommendations in order to reduce possible exposure to SARS-CoV-2. When extensive differential diagnostic testing and/or surgery is not feasible, it should be deferred and medical treatment should be initiated. Transsphenoidal pituitary surgery should be delayed during high SARS-CoV-2 viral prevalence. Medical management rather than surgery will be the used for most patients, since the short- to mid-term prognosis depends in most cases on hypercortisolism rather than its cause; it should be initiated promptly to minimize the risk of infection in these immunosuppressed patients. The risk/benefit ratio of these recommendations will need re-evaluation every 2-3 months from April 2020 in each country (and possibly local areas) and will depend on the local health care structure and phase of pandemic.","Newell-Price, John; Nieman, Lynnette K; Reincke, Martin; Tabarin, Antoine",Eur J Endocrinol,353,23

Individual behavior and collective responsibility are considered crucial to ensure both personal and community wellbeing in a pandemic context. Trends in government policies, the number of infectious cases, and community mobility are examined using multiple data sources. The mobility changes that occurred during the state of emergency are revealed by a time-series analysis of variables that measure both the epidemiological severity level and government stringency. The results demonstrate a high response capability of the local government, inhabitants, and communities. Communities in Hong Kong are found to have reacted faster than the implementation of health interventions, whereas the government policies effectively reduced the number of infection cases. The ways in which community action are vital to empower flexible and adaptive community responses are also explored. The results indicate that voluntary community involvement constitutes a necessary condition to help inform and reshape future transport policy and response strategies to mitigate the pandemic.","Chan, Ho-Yin; Chen, Anthony; Ma, Wei; Sze, Nang-Ngai; Liu, Xintao",,353,24

METHODS: Pooled rate of each of the rs713598, rs1726866, rs10246939, and PAV/AVI polymorphisms of the TAS2R38 gene was obtained in different countries using a systematic review methodology and its relationship with the mortality of COVID-19. Data were analyzed by the comprehensive meta-analysis software and SPSS. RESULTS: There was only a significant reverse Pearson correlation in death counts and PAV/AVI ratio, p = 0.047, r = -0.503. Also, a significant reverse correlation of PAV/AVI ratio and death rate was seen, r = -0.572 p = 0.021. rs10246939 ratio had a significant positive correlation with death rate, r = 0.851 p = 0.031. Further analysis was not significant. Our results showed that the higher presence of PAV allele than AVI, and a higher rate of G allele than A in rs10246939 polymorphism in a country, could be associated with lower COVID-19 mortality. While assessing all three polymorphisms showed a huge diversity worldwide. CONCLUSION: Due to extraoral activities of bitter taste receptor genes, especially in mucosal immunity, this gene seems to be a good candidate for future studies on COVID-19 pathophysiology. Also, the high worldwide diversity of TAS2R38 genes polymorphism and its possible assassination with mortality raises concerns about the efficiency of vaccine projects in different ethnicities.","Parsa, Shima; Mogharab, Vahid; Ebrahimi, Mohsen; Ahmadi, Sayyed Reza; Shahi, Behzad; Mehramiz, Neema John; Foroughian, Mahdi; Zarenezhad, Mohammad; Kalani, Navid; Abdi, Mohammad Hashem; Javdani, Farshid; Keshavarz, Pouyan; Hatami, Naser",Int J Biol Macromol,353,20

We describe the performance of ddPCR-in particular, its ability to confirm weak-positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) results. METHODS: We clinically validated the Bio-Rad Triplex Probe ddPCR Assay. The limit of detection was determined by using serial dilutions of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in an artificial viral envelope. The ddPCR assay was performed according to the manufacturer's specifications on specimens confirmed to be positive (nâ =â 48) or negative (nâ =â 30) by an FDA-validated reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay on the m2000 RealTime system (Abbott). Ten borderline positive cases were also evaluated. RESULTS: The limit of detection was 50 copies/mL (19 of 20 positive). Forty-seven specimens spanning a range of quantification cycles (2.9-25.9 cycle numbers) were positive by this assay (47 of 48; 97.9% positive precent agreement), and 30 negative samples were confirmed as negative (30 of 30; 100% negative percent agreement). Nine of 10 borderline cases were positive when tested in triplicate. CONCLUSIONS: The ddPCR of SARS-CoV-2 is an accurate method, with superior sensitivity for viral RNA detection.

Of the 4036 studies identified, 110 full-text studies were reviewed and 15 studies were included in the final analysis and quality assessment. No empirical evidence of the effectiveness of automated contact tracing (regarding contacts identified or transmission reduction) was identified. Four of seven included modelling studies that suggested that controlling COVID-19 requires a high population uptake of automated contact-tracing apps (estimates from 56% to 95%), typically alongside other control measures. Studies of partly automated contact tracing generally reported more complete contact identification and follow-up compared with manual systems. Automated contact tracing could potentially reduce transmission with sufficient population uptake. However, concerns regarding privacy and equity should be considered. Well designed prospective studies are needed given gaps in evidence of effectiveness, and to investigate the integration and relative effects of manual and automated systems. Large-scale manual contact tracing is therefore still key in most contexts.","Braithwaite, Isobel; Callender, Thomas; Bullock, Miriam; Aldridge, Robert W",,353,16

However, this technique has two remarkable drawbacks: (i) the large variability of the selected bandwidths, and (ii) the inability to provide results in a reasonable time for very large sample sizes. To overcome these problems, bagging cross-validation bandwidths are analyzed in this paper. This approach consists in computing the cross-validation bandwidths for a finite number of subsamples and then rescaling the averaged smoothing parameters to the original sample size. Under a random-design regression model, asymptotic expressions up to a second-order for the bias and variance of the leave-one-out cross-validation bandwidth for the Nadaraya--Watson estimator are obtained. Subsequently, the asymptotic bias and variance and the limit distribution are derived for the bagged cross-validation selector. Suitable choices of the number of subsamples and the subsample size lead to an $n^{-1/2}$ rate for the convergence in distribution of the bagging cross-validation selector, outperforming the rate $n^{-3/10}$ of leave-one-out cross-validation. Several simulations and an illustration on a real dataset related to the COVID-19 pandemic show the behavior of our proposal and its better performance, in terms of statistical efficiency and computing time, when compared to leave-one-out cross-validation.","Barreiro-Ures, D.; Cao, R.; Francisco-Fern'andez, M.",,353,26

We aimed to test plausible hypotheses regarding the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying CARDS, and to evaluate the resulting implications for ventilatory management. Design: We adapted a high-fidelity computational simulator, previously validated in several studies of ARDS, to (a) develop quantitative insights into the key pathophysiologic differences between CARDS and conventional ARDS, and (b) assess the impact of different PEEP, FiO2 and tidal volume settings. Setting: Interdisciplinary Collaboration in Systems Medicine Research Network. Subjects: The simulator was calibrated to represent CARDS patients with both normal and elevated body mass indices undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation. Measurements and Main Results: An ARDS model implementing disruption of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and vasodilation leading to hyperperfusion of collapsed lung regions failed to replicate clinical data on Type 1 CARDS patients. Adding mechanisms to reflect disruption of alveolar gas-exchange due to the effects of pneumonitis, and heightened vascular resistance due to the emergence of microthrombi, produced levels of V/Q mismatch and hypoxemia consistent with data from Type 1 CARDS patients, while preserving close to normal lung compliance and gas volumes. Atypical responses to PEEP increments between 5 and 15 cmH2O were observed for this Type 1 CARDS model across a range of measures: increasing PEEP resulted in reduced lung compliance and no improvement in oxygenation, while Mechanical Power, Driving Pressure and Plateau Pressure all increased. FiO2 settings based on ARDSnet protocols at different PEEP levels were insufficient to achieve adequate oxygenation. Incrementing tidal volumes from 5 to 10 ml/kg produced similar increases in multiple indicators of ventilator induced lung injury in the Type 1 CARDS model to those seen in a conventional ARDS model. Conclusions: Our model suggests that use of standard PEEP/ FiO2 tables, higher PEEP strategies, and higher tidal volumes, may all be potentially deleterious in Type 1 CARDS patients, and that a highly personalized approach to treatment is advisable.","Das, A.; Saffaran, S.; Chikhani, M.; Scott, T.; Laviola, M.; Yehya, N.; Laffey, J.; Hardman, J.

While the most common cause of congenital agammaglobulinemia is X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), accounting for approximately 85% of cases, other genetic forms of agammaglobulinemia have been identified. Early recognition and diagnosis of these conditions are pivotal for improved outcomes and prevention of sequelae and complications. The diagnosis of XLA is often delayed, and can be missed if patient has a mild phenotype. The lack of correlation between phenotype and genotype in this condition makes management and predicting outcomes quite difficult. In contrast, while less common, autosomal recessive forms of agammaglobulinemia present at younger ages and with typically more severe clinical features resulting in an earlier diagnosis. Some diagnostic innovations, such as KREC level measurements and serum BCMA measurements, may aid in facilitating an earlier identification of agammaglobulinemia leading to prompt treatment. Earlier diagnosis may improve the overall health of patients with XLA.","Cardenas-Morales, Melissa; Hernandez-Trujillo, Vivian P.",Clin Rev Allergy Immunol,353,28

In this study, the analytical and clinical performances of a chemiluminescent immunoassays for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG detection (Mindray CL-1200i), targeting Nucleocapsid (N) and receptor binding domain (RBD) portion of the Spike protein, were evaluated. Methods: Precision and linearity were evaluated using standardized procedures. A total of 157 leftover serum samples from 81 hospitalized confirmed COVID-19 patients (38 with moderate and 43 with severe disease) and 76 SARS-CoV-2 negative subjects (44 healthcare workers, 20 individuals with rheumatic disorders, 12 pregnant women) were included in the study. In an additional series of 44 SARS-CoV-2 positive, IgM and IgG time kinetics were also evaluated in a time-period of 38 days. Results: Precision was below or equal to 4% for both IgM and IgG, in all the studied levels, whilst a slightly significant deviation from linearity was observed for both assays in the range of values covering the manufacturer's cut-off. Considering a time frame [≥] 12 days post symptom onset, sensitivity and specificity for IgM were 92.3% (95%CI:79.1%-98.4%) and 92.1% (95%CI:83.6%-97.0%). In the same time frame, sensitivity and specificity for IgG were 100% (95%CI:91.0%-100%) and 93.4% (95%CI:85.3%-97.8%). The assays agreement was 73.9% (Cohen's kappa of 0.373). Time kinetics showed a substantial overlapping of IgM and IgG response, the latter values being elevated up to 38 days from symptoms onset. Conclusions: Analytical imprecision is satisfactory as well as the linearity, particularly when taking into account the fact that both assays are claimed to be qualitative. Diagnostic sensitivity of IgG was excellent, especially considering specimens collected [≥]12 days post symptom onset. Time kinetics suggest that IgM and IgG are detectable early in the course of infection, but the role of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in clinical practice still requires further evaluations.","Padoan, A.; Cosma, C.; Zaupa, P.; Plebani, M.",,353,28

In addition, biosecurity practices were reevaluated and strengthened throughout the industry. At the time of the outbreak epidemiologists did not understand, as well as they are understood today, all the risk factors that contribute to the spread of PEDV. As a result, the epidemiological investigations into the 2014 PEDV outbreak in eastern Canada may not have investigated all risk factors as thoroughly as they would be investigated today. In retrospect, many of the Bradford Hill criteria used to determine causation were not fulfilled. This review identifies risk factors that were not included in the 2014 epidemiology.

This report describes a virus identification method featuring high throughput, high resolution, and high sensitivity detection of viruses. Identification of virus is based on liquid hybridization of different lengths of virus-specific probes to their corresponding viruses. The probes bound to target sequences are removed by a biotin–streptavidin pull-down mechanism and the supernatant is analyzed by capillary electrophoresis. The probes depleted from the sample appear as diminished peaks in the electropherograms and the remaining probes serve as calibrators to align peaks in different capillaries. The virus identities are unraveled by a signal processing and peak detection algorithm developed in-house. Nine viruses were used in the study to demonstrate how the system works to unravel the virus identity in single and double virus infections. With properly designed probes, the system is able to distinguish closely related viruses. The system takes advantage of the high resolution feature of capillary electrophoresis to resolve probes that differ by length. The method may facilitate virus identity screen from more candidate viruses with an automated 4-color DNA sequencer.","Wang, Chin-Yu; Hsiao, Tzu-Hung; Chu, Liang-Hui; Lin, Yi-Ling; Huang, Jau-Ling; Chen, Chung-Hsuan; Peck, Konan",Anal Chim Acta,353,3

Ninety older adults aged over 65 (age: 78.9 ± 4.8 years; 62% female) underwent instrumental gait analysis, performed using a wearable inertial sensor and cognitive assessment with the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination Revised (ACE-R). They were stratified into three groups based on their MMSE performance: healthy controls (HC), early and advanced cognitive decline (ECD, ACD). The spatio-temporal and smoothness of gait parameters, the latter expressed through HR in anteroposterior (AP), vertical (V) and mediolateral (ML) directions, were derived from trunk acceleration data. The existence of a relationship between gait parameters and degree of cognitive impairment was also explored. The results show that individuals with ECD and ACD exhibited significantly slower speed and shorter stride length, as well as reduced values of HR in the AP and V directions compared to HC, while no significant differences were found between ECD and ACD in any of the investigated parameters. Gait speed, stride length and HR in all directions were found to be moderately correlated with both MMSE and ACE-R scores. Such findings suggest that, in addition to the known changes in gait speed and stride length, important reductions in smoothness of gait are likely to occur in older adults, owing to early/prodromal stages of cognitive impairment. Given the peculiar nature of these metrics, which refers to overall body stability during gait, the calculation of HR may result in being useful in improving the characterization of gait patterns in older adults with cognitive impairments.","Pau, Massimiliano; Mulas, Ilaria; Putzu, Valeria; Asoni, Gesuina; Viale, Daniela; Mameli, Irene; Leban, Bruno; Allali, Gilles",Sensors (Basel),353,1

The FDA Medical Countermeasures Initiative previously funded a study of HP vapor decontamination of respirators using a Clarus C system (Bioquell, Horsham, PA) which normally is used to fumigate hospital rooms. The process preserved respirator function, but it is unknown if HP vapor would be virucidal since respirators have porous fabric that may harbor virus. We evaluated the virucidal activity of HP vapor using a BQ-50 system (Bioquell, Horsham, PA) after inoculating 3M 1870 N95 respirators (3M, St. Paul, MN) with 3 aerosolized bacteriophage that are a reasonable proxy for SARS-CoV-2. Inoculation resulted in contamination of the respirator with 9.87e4 plaque forming units (PFU) of phage phi-6, 4.17e7 PFU of phage T7 and 1.35e7 PFU of phage T1. Respirators were reprocessed with BQ-50 with a long aeration phase to reduce HP vapors. Virucidal activity was measured by a standard plaquing assay prior to and after sterilization. A single HP vapor cycle resulted in complete eradication of phage from masks (limit of detection 10 PFU, lower than the infectious dose of the majority of respiratory viral pathogens). After 5 cycles, the respirators appeared similar to new with no deformity. Use of a Bioquell machine can be scaled to permit simultaneous sterilization of a large number of used but otherwise intact respirators. HP vapor reprocessing may ease shortages and provide a higher filtration crisis alternative to non-NIOSH masks.","Kenney, Patrick; Chan, Benjamin K; Kortright, Kaitlyn; Cintron, Margaret; Havill, Nancy; Russi, Mark; Epright, Jaqueline; Lee, Lorraine; Balcezak, Thomas; Martinello, Richard",,353,30

METHODS: This observational study included children and adolescents (under 16 years) admitted with new-onset type 1 diabetes. SARS-CoV-2 serology was taken within the first month of diabetes. RESULTS: Of the 75 participants, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were positive in 20% of patients. They had an increased bicarbonate and base excess at diagnosis. Overall 29% of patients presented diabetic ketoacidosis at diagnosis and 9% of them were positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

Early ground glass opacities detected by CT, which are reminiscent of lung infarcts associated with pulmonary embolism, point to a novel vascular pathology in COVID-19. Under physiological conditions, normal parenchymal oxygenation is maintained by three sources: the alveolus itself and dual oxygen supply from the pulmonary and bronchial artery circulations. We propose a model in which these three components are disrupted in COVID-19 pneumonia, with severe viral alveolitis and concomitant immunothrombotic obstruction of the pulmonary and bronchiolar circulation. Tricompartmental disruption might have two main consequences: systemic clot embolisation from pulmonary vein territory immunothrombosis, and alveolar–capillary barrier disruption with systemic access of thrombogenic viral material.

We report a novel design for a portable, digital slit lamp using a smartphone. It works on an advanced optical design and has the capability of instantaneous, objective photodocumentation to capture anterior segment images and is telemedicine-enabled. METHODS: The device is constructed keeping its usability and the importance of design ergonomics for nonspecialized field personnel in mind. The optical design is described, and the resolution and magnification are compared with traditional desktop-based slit lamps. A Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)–compliant, patient management software is integrated to synchronize the captured images with a secure cloud server along with a sharpness algorithm to extract the best focused frames of the cornea, iris, and lens, from videos. We demonstrate its photodocumentation ability and teleophthalmology feasibility by capturing images in a pilot study from nine subjects. RESULTS: Images were obtained in various illumination, magnification, and filter settings. Synchronous and asynchronous teleophthalmology consults were conducted. The performance of the device was shown to be limited by the smartphone sensor resolution and not the optical design, because the Air Force target resolution was found to be the same on smartphone-mounted traditional slit lamps despite a lower magnification.

This study was performed to systematically review the role of CQ and HCQ in preventing the spread of COVID‐19. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials.gov, International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and Cochrane Library databases were searched for studies that evaluated the prophylactic role of CQ or HCQ on SARS‐CoV‐2 (pre‐clinical studies) or COVID‐19 (clinical studies) until 30 March 2020. The available literature was critically appraised. RESULTS: A total of 45 articles were screened and 5 (3 in vitro pre‐clinical studies and 2 clinical opinions) were included. The pre‐clinical studies showed the prophylactic effects of CQ and HCQ against SARS‐CoV‐2. On the other hand, the clinical opinions advocated the prophylactic use of CQ and HCQ against COVID‐19. However, no original clinical studies on the prophylactic role of CQ or HCQ on COVID‐19 were available. CONCLUSION: Although pre‐clinical results are promising, to date there is a dearth of evidence to support the efficacy of CQ or HCQ in preventing COVID‐19.

Several parameters control the functional scaffolds, such as fiber geometrical characteristics and alignment, architecture, etc. As it is based on nanotechnology, the concept of this approach has shown a strong evolution in terms of the forms of the materials used (aerogels, microspheres, etc.), the incorporated microorganisms used to treat diseases (cells, proteins, nuclei acids, etc.), and the manufacturing process in relation to the control of adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation of the mimetic nanofibers.

Published systematic reviews include different primary studies, producing varying lists of barriers. To make sense of this diverse body of literature, a comprehensive level of summary and synthesis is necessary. This overview of systematic reviews maps all potential parent-level barriers to childhood vaccination identified in systematic reviews. It synthesises these into a conceptual framework to inform development of a vaccine barriers assessment tool. METHODS: We applied Joanna Briggs methodology, searching the Epistemonikos review database and reference lists of included reviews to June 2020. Systematic reviews of qualitative or quantitative data on parent-level barriers to routine vaccination in preschool-aged children were included. Reviews addressing influenza, reporting non-modifiable determinants or reporting barriers not relevant to parents were excluded. Where possible, we extracted review details, barrier descriptions and the number, setting and design of primary studies. Two authors independently screened search results and inductively coded barrier descriptions. RESULTS: We screened 464 papers, identifying 30 relevant reviews with minimal overlap. Fourteen reviews included qualitative and quantitative primary studies, seven included quantitative and seven included qualitative studies only. Two did not report included study designs. Two-thirds of reviews (n=20; 67%) only included primary studies from high-income countries. We extracted 573 barrier descriptions and inductively coded these into 64 unique barriers in six overarching categories: (1) Access, (2) Clinic or Health System Barriers, (3) Concerns and Beliefs, (4) Health Perceptions and Experiences, (5) Knowledge and Information and (6) Social or Family Influence. CONCLUSIONS: A global overview of systematic reviews of parent-level barriers to childhood vaccine uptake identified 64 barriers to inform development of a new comprehensive survey instrument. This instrument will assess both access and acceptance barriers to more accurately diagnose the reasons for under-vaccination in children in different settings.","Kaufman, Jessica; Tuckerman, Jane; Bonner, Carissa; Durrheim, David N; Costa, Daniel; Trevena, Lyndal; Thomas, Susan; Danchin, Margie",BMJ Glob Health,353,10

METHODS: We used a panel of 167 samples (77 pre-epidemic and 90 COVID-19 seroconverters) and SARS-CoV1, SARS-CoV2 and MERS-CoV Spike and/or Nucleopcapsid (NC) proteins to develop a high throughput multiplex screening assay to detect IgG antibodies in human plasma. Assay performances were determined by ROC curves analysis. A subset of the COVID-19+ samples (n = 36) were also tested by a commercial NC-based ELISA test and the results compared with those of the novel assay. RESULTS: On samples collected ≥14 days after symptoms onset, the accuracy of the assay is 100% (95% CI: 100-100) for the Spike antigen and 99.9% (95% CI:99.7-100) for NC. By logistic regression, we estimated that 50% of the patients have seroconverted at 5.7 ± 1.6; 5.7 ± 1.8 and 7.9 ± 1.0 days after symptoms onset against Spike, NC or both antigens, respectively and all have seroconverted two weeks after symptoms onset. IgG titration in a subset of samples showed that early phase samples present lower IgG titers than those from later phase. IgG to SARS-CoV2 NC cross-reacted at 100% with SARS-CoV1 NC. Twenty-nine of the 36 (80.5%) samples tested were positive by the commercial ELISA while 31/36 (86.1%) were positive by the novel assay. CONCLUSIONS: Our assay is highly sensitive and specific for the detection of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV2 proteins, suitable for high throughput epidemiological surveys. The novel assay is more sensitive than a commercial ELISA.","Ayouba, Ahidjo; Thaurignac, Guillaume; Morquin, David; Tuaillon, Edouard; Raulino, Raisa; Nkuba, Antoine; Lacroix, Audrey; Vidal, Nicole; Foulongne, Vincent; Le Moing, Vincent; Reynes, Jacques; Delaporte, Eric; Peeters, Martine",J Clin Virol,353,22

We have previously demonstrated that replacement of the S glycoprotein ectodomain from the avirulent Beaudette strain of IBV with the corresponding region from the virulent M41-CK strain resulted in a recombinant virus, BeauR-M41(S), with the in vitro cell tropism of M41-CK. The IBV Beaudette strain is able to replicate in both primary chick kidney cells and Vero cells, whereas the IBV M41-CK strain replicates in primary cells only. In order to investigate the region of the IBV S responsible for growth in Vero cells, we generated a series of recombinant IBVs expressing chimeric S glycoproteins, consisting of regions from the Beaudette and M41-CK S gene sequences, within the genomic background of Beaudette. The S2, but not the S1, subunit of the Beaudette S was found to confer the ability to grow in Vero cells. Various combinations of Beaudette-specific amino acids were introduced into the S2 subunit of M41 to determine the minimum requirement to confer tropism for growth in Vero cells. The ability of IBV to grow and produce infectious progeny virus in Vero cells was subsequently narrowed down to just 3 amino acids surrounding the S2′ cleavage site. Conversely, swapping of the 3 Beaudette-associated amino acids with the corresponding ones from M41 was sufficient to abolish Beaudette growth in Vero cells. IMPORTANCE Infectious bronchitis remains a major problem in the global poultry industry, despite the existence of many different vaccines. IBV vaccines, both live attenuated and inactivated, are currently grown on embryonated hen's eggs, a cumbersome and expensive process due to the fact that most IBV strains do not grow in cultured cells. The reverse genetics system for IBV creates the opportunity for generating rationally designed and more effective vaccines. The observation that IBV Beaudette has the additional tropism for growth on Vero cells also invokes the possibility of generating IBV vaccines produced from cultured cells rather than by the use of embryonated eggs. The regions of the IBV Beaudette S glycoprotein involved in the determination of extended cellular tropism were identified in this study. This information will enable the rational design of a future generation of IBV vaccines that may be grown on Vero cells.","Bickerton, Erica; Maier, Helena J.; Stevenson-Leggett, Phoebe; Armesto, Maria; Britton, Paul",J Virol,353,16

We evaluated whether SARS-CoV-2 can remain on the surface of MPs of first-line healthcare workers (HCW) and also the knowledge of HCWs about SARS-CoV-2 cross-transmission and conceptions on the virus survival on the MPs of HCWs. A cross-sectional study was conducted in the COVID-19 Intensive Care Unit of a teaching hospital. An educational campaign was carried out on cross-transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and its permanence in fomites, in addition to the proper use and disinfection of MPs. Herewith an electronic questionnaire was applied including queried conceptions about hand hygiene and care with MP before and after the pandemic. The MPs were swabbed with a nylon FLOQ Swab(™), in an attempt to increase the recovery of SARS-CoV-2. All MP swab samples were subjected to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR; RT-PCR positive samples were subjected to viral culture in Vero cells (ATCC(®) CCL-81™). Fifty-one MPs were swabbed and a questionnaire on hand hygiene and the use and disinfection of MP was applied after an educational campaign. Most HCWs increased adherence to hand hygiene and MP disinfection during the pandemic. Fifty-one MP swabs were collected and two were positive by RT-PCR (4%), with Cycle threshold (C(t) ) values of 34-36, however, the cultures of these samples were negative. Although most HCWs believed in the importance of cross-transmission and increased adherence to hand hygiene and disinfection of MP during the pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in MPs.

We compared sequences from 37 patients collected over a 20-month period with sequences from GenBank and our own database of HAdVs. Maximum likelihood trees and pairwise differences were used to evaluate genotypic relationships, paired with the epidemiological data from routine infection prevention and control (IPC) records and hospital activity data. During this time period, two formal outbreaks had been declared by IPC, while WGS detected nine monophyletic clusters, seven were corroborated by epidemiological evidence and by comparison of single-nucleotide polymorphisms. One of the formal outbreaks was confirmed, and the other was not. Of the five HAdV-associated deaths, three were unlinked and the remaining two considered the source of transmission. Mixed infection was frequent (10%), providing a sentinel source of recombination and superinfection. Immunosuppressed patients harboring a high rate of HAdV positivity require comprehensive surveillance.

To establish a productive infection in new host species, viruses must overcome barriers to replication mediated by diverse and rapidly evolving host restriction factors such as protein kinase R (PKR). Many viral antagonists of these restriction factors are species specific. For example, the rhesus cytomegalovirus PKR antagonist, RhTRS1, inhibits PKR in some African green monkey (AGM) cells, but does not inhibit human or rhesus macaque PKR. To model the evolutionary changes necessary for cross-species transmission, we generated a recombinant vaccinia virus that expresses RhTRS1 in a strain that lacks PKR inhibitors E3L and K3L (VVΔEΔK+RhTRS1). Serially passaging VVΔEΔK+RhTRS1 in minimally-permissive AGM cells increased viral replication 10- to 100-fold. Notably, adaptation in these AGM cells also improved virus replication 1000- to 10,000-fold in human and rhesus cells. Genetic analyses including deep sequencing revealed amplification of the rhtrs1 locus in the adapted viruses. Supplying additional rhtrs1 in trans confirmed that amplification alone was sufficient to improve VVΔEΔK+RhTRS1 replication. Viruses with amplified rhtrs1 completely blocked AGM PKR, but only partially blocked human PKR, consistent with the replication properties of these viruses in AGM and human cells. Finally, in contrast to AGM-adapted viruses, which could be serially propagated in human cells, VVΔEΔK+RhTRS1 yielded no progeny virus after only three passages in human cells. Thus, rhtrs1 amplification in a minimally permissive intermediate host was a necessary step, enabling expansion of the virus range to previously nonpermissive hosts. These data support the hypothesis that amplification of a weak viral antagonist may be a general evolutionary mechanism to permit replication in otherwise resistant host species, providing a molecular foothold that could enable further adaptations necessary for efficient replication in the new host.","Brennan, Greg; Kitzman, Jacob O.; Rothenburg, Stefan; Shendure, Jay; Geballe, Adam P.",PLoS Pathog,353,20

In this study, we investigated the effects of pomegranate peel extract (PPE) on the reduction of HuNoV in different food models, on surfaces of fresh produce (green onion and cherry tomato), in low-fat milk, and simulated gastrointestinal fluids. The antiviral efficacy of PPE against HuNoV was evaluated by quantifying the number of residual virus genomes using a quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) assay. Pomegranate peel, considered as a waste product of industrial processing, is known for beneficial health effects and broad antimicrobial activity due to the high content of phenolic compounds and tannins. PPE showed significant antiviral properties against HuNoV both in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and simulated gastric fluid. The reduction of HuNoV by pomegranate juice was lower than with PPE, which could be attributed to the lower content of antimicrobial compounds. A pretreatment of cherry tomato and green onion surfaces with PPE significantly reduced the amount of HuNoV particles that adhered to those surfaces during subsequent virus suspension treatment. A detrimental effect of PPE on HuNoV structure was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Our results indicate that PPE is a natural antiviral agent effective against food-borne noroviruses.","Živković, Ivana; Šavikin, Katarina; Živković, Jelena; Zdunić, Gordana; Janković, Teodora; Lazić, Dejan; Radin, Dragoslava",Plant Foods Hum Nutr,353,1

Such physical performance is largely influenced by the strength of the quadriceps and hamstrings muscles. Flexibility of the hamstrings is important because quadriceps muscle activity influences the hip flexion angle. Therefore, hamstring flexibility is essential to improve physical performance. In this study, Myofascial Release (MFR) was applied to the hamstrings to evaluate its effects. MFR on the hamstrings was performed on 17 young adults. Physical function and physical performance were measured before, immediately after, and 5 days after the MFR intervention: finger floor distance (FFD), range of motion (ROM) of the straight leg raising test (SLR), standing long jump (SLJ), squat jump (SJ), functional reach test (FRT), comfortable walking speeds (C-walking speed), and maximum walking speeds (M-walking speed). The results of the analysis show a significant increase in FFD (−2.6 ± 8.9 vs. 0.4 ± 9.4 vs. 2.4 ± 8.9, p < 0.01), SLJ (185.6 ± 44.5 vs. 185.0 ± 41.8 vs. 196.6 ± 40.1, p < 0.01), and M-walking speed (2.9 ± 0.6 vs. 3.0 ± 0.6 vs. 3.3 ± 0.6, p < 0.01). This study has shown that MFR for hamstrings not only improves flexibility but also increases M-walking speed and physical performance of the SLJ. As MFR is safe and does not involve joint movement, it may be useful for maintaining and improving performance and flexibility during inactivity and for stretching before exercise.","Itotani, Keisuke; Kawahata, Kanta; Takashima, Wakana; Mita, Wakana; Minematsu, Hitomi; Fujita, Hiroyuki",Healthcare (Basel),353,16

Daily inpatient antimicrobial therapy is an alternative to hospitalization, which is similar to OPAT; patients go home after they are administered antibiotics in a separate room in the hospital setting. OBJECTIVES: We assessed our previous daily inpatient practice to revitalize the model in the COVID‐19 era. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the clinical and microbiological responses and the cost effectiveness of the patients with cUTIs who received daily inpatient ertapenem therapy. RESULTS: Our study population was 136 patients in 156 episodes. It was a difficult‐to‐treat group with older age (mean 63.0 ± 14.8 years) and a high burden of underlying conditions (86.5%). The most common causative organisms were Escherichia coli (74.4%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (19.2%); 89.7% of the isolates were producing extended‐spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL). The microbiologic and clinical success rates were 82.1% and 95.5%, respectively.

Lesotho also faces the challenge of a largely rural population who incur a significant time and financial burden to visit healthcare facilities. Using data from a cluster‐randomized non‐inferiority trial conducted between August 2017 and July 2019, we evaluated costs to providers and costs to patients of community‐based differentiated models of multi‐month delivery of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Lesotho. METHODS: The trial of multi‐month dispensing compared 12‐month retention in care among three arms: conventional care, which required quarterly facility visits and ART dispensation (3MF); three‐month community adherence groups (CAGs) (3MC) and six‐month community ART distribution (6MCD). We first estimated the average total annual cost of providing HIV care and treatment followed by the total cost per patient retained 12 months after entry for each arm, using resource utilization data from the trial and local unit costs. We then estimated the average annual cost to patients in each arm with self‐reported questionnaire data. RESULTS: The average total annual cost of providing HIV care and treatment per patient was the highest in the 3MF arm ($122.28, standard deviation [SD] $23.91), followed by 3MC ($114.20, SD $23.03) and the 6MCD arm ($112.58, SD $21.44). Per patient retained in care, the average provider cost was $125.99 (SD $24.64) in the 3MF arm and 6% to 8% less for the other two arms ($118.38, SD $23.87 and $118.83, SD $22.63 for the 3MC and 6MCD respectively). There was a large reduction in patient costs for both differentiated service delivery arms: from $44.42 (SD $12.06) annually in the 3MF arm to $16.34 (SD $5.11) annually in the 3MC (63% reduction) and $18.77 (SD $8.31) annually in 6MCD arm (58% reduction). CONCLUSIONS: Community‐based, multi‐month models of ART in Lesotho are likely to produce small cost savings to treatment providers and large savings to patients in Lesotho. Patient cost savings may support long‐term adherence and retention in care.","Nichols, Brooke E; Cele, Refiloe; Lekodeba, Nkgomeleng; Tukei, Betty; Ngorima‐Mabhena, Nicoletta; Tiam, Appolinaire; Maotoe, Thapelo; Sejana, Makatleho Veronica; Faturiyele, Iyiola O; Chasela, Charles; Rosen, Sydney; Fatti, Geoffrey",J Int AIDS Soc,353,1

Consistent with the previous literature, numerical evidence on the rapid drying process of even large droplets, up to sizes [Formula: see text] , into droplet nuclei/aerosols is provided.

RESULTS: The WB does not contain enzymes, but there are 152.8, 549.2, 289.5, and 147.1 U/g dry matter xylanase, protease, cellulase and β-glucanase in FWB, respectively. Furthermore, FWB can decrease nitric oxide release of lipopolysaccharide stimulated chicken peripheral blood mononuclear cells by about two times. Results show that 10% FWB inclusion had significantly the highest weight gain (WG) at 1 to 21 d; 5% FWB had the lowest feed conversion rate at 22 to 35 d; 10% WB and 10% FWB inclusion have the highest villus height and Lactobacillus spp. number in caecum; and both 5% and 10% FWB can increase ash content in femurs. Compared to control group, all treatments increase mucin 2, and tight junction (TJ), such as occludin, claudin-1, zonula occludens-1, and mRNA expression in ileum by at least 5 folds.

Methods : We investigated 1,701 PLWHA through a telephone interview and found 11 COVID-19 patients in four districts of Wuhan, China. The demographic features and major clinical characteristics of these patients were retrieved from the information management systems for COVID-19 patients of four districts’ CDC. Statistical analysis was performed to find out the driving force of COVID-19 among PLWHA. Results : The incidence proportion of COVID-19 in PLWHA is 0.6% (95% CI: 0.2% - 1.0%), which is comparable to the overall population incidence rate in Wuhan city (0.6%). Nine out of the 11 COVID-19/AIDS patients had relatively high CD4+ T lymphocyte count (>200/μl) and undetectable HIV viral load (＜20 copies/ml), and ten of them were on antiretroviral therapy. PLWHA who were old, had low CD4+ T lymphocyte count, infected HIV through homosexual activity, and had been diagnosed for HIV for a long time, were more likely to develop COVID-19.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is common in acute situations where it is linked with more complications and mortality. We aimed to evaluate the prognostic information of AF in this population. METHODS: retrospective analysis of a cohort of 517 patients consecutively admitted in a tertiary hospital due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We divided the patients in two groups according the development of AF and compared the main features of both groups. An univariable and multivariable analysis of mortality were also performed. RESULTS: among 517 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted in a tertiary center, 54 (10.4%) developed AF. These patients are older (81.6 vs 66.5 years old, p<0.001) and present more hypertension (74% vs 47%, p<0.001), cardiomyopathy (9% vs 1%, p=0.002), previous heart failure admission (9% vs 0.4%, p<0.001), previous episodes of AF (83% vs 1%, p<0.001) and bigger left atrium (47.8 vs 39.9 mm, p<0.001). AF COVID-19 patients present more acute respiratory failure (72% vs 40%, p<0.001) and higher in-hospital mortality (50% vs 22%, p<0.001). Predictors of AF development are age and previous AF. AF is not an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality. Predictors are age, creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL at admission, LDH > 250 UI/L at admission and acute respiratory failure. CONCLUSION: Atrial fibrillation appears in 10% of hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. These patients present more comorbidities and two-fold increase in hospital mortality.

Ascovirus-parasitoids wasp-noctuid insects constitute the dissemination system. Selection of suitable reference genes for the dissemination system could play an important role in elucidating the pathogenic molecular mechanisms of ascovirus. Unfortunately, such studies on potential reference genes in the dissemination system of ascoviruses are lacking. In the present study, we evaluated 11 candidate reference genes: β-actin1 (ACT1), β-actin2 (ACT2), elongation factor 1 (EF1), elongation factor 2 (EF2), ribosomal protein L10 (L10), ribosomal protein L17A (L17A), superoxide dismutase (SOD), 28S ribosome (28S), Tubulin (TUB) and 18S ribosome (18S). The samples were originally from various virus concentrations and points-in-time of experimental treatments using RefFinder and four algorithms. The results showed that EF1 was the most stable internal gene in S. exigua and M. similis and that EF2 was the most stable in the IOZCAS-Spex-II-A cell line, and the stability of reference genes were confirmed via the expression levels of two inhibitor of apoptosis-like (iap-like) genes from Heliothis virescens ascovirus 3 h (HvAV-3h). This study provides a crucial basis for future research that explores the molecular mechanisms of the pathogenesis of ascoviruses.","Chen, Zi-Shu; Han, Ning-Ning; Li, Jian-Hong; Huang, Guo-Hua; Wan, Hu",Sci Rep,353,1

Whereas interactions at the protein level are well explored, RNA interactions are less so. Novel sequencing methodologies have helped uncover the importance of RNA–protein and RNA–RNA interactions during infection. In addition to messenger RNAs (mRNAs), mammalian cells express a great number of regulatory non-coding RNAs, some of which are crucial for regulation of the immune system whereas others are utilized by viruses. It is thus becoming increasingly clear that RNA interactions play important roles for both sides in the arms race between virus and host. With the emerging field of RNA therapeutics, such interactions are promising antiviral targets. In this review, we discuss direct and indirect RNA interactions occurring between RNA viruses or retroviruses and host non-coding transcripts upon infection. In addition, we review RNA virus derived non-coding RNAs affecting immunological and metabolic pathways of the host cell typically to provide an advantage to the virus. The relatively few known examples of virus–host RNA interactions suggest that many more await discovery.","Damas, Nkerorema Djodji; Fossat, Nicolas; Scheel, Troels K. H.",Noncoding RNA,353,24

The articles were systematically screened through several search engine and databases. The articles published or in preprint were included in the study till 15th May 2020. The systematic review done as per the published literatures which included 31 cross sectional, observational studies and case reports which revealed neurological signs and symptoms in SARS-COV-2 disease. For meta-analysis, we included 09 observational and cross-sectional studies which included COVID-19 positive patients and assessed the predominance of various neurological signs and symptoms in COVID-19 patients with relation to SARS-2002 and MERS-2012. Data was analyzed by using the “MedCalc” Statistical Software version 19.2.6 and reported as pooled prevalence. Standard I(2) test was used to analyze the heterogeneity. We have collected and screened about a total 2615articles, finally we have included 31articles for the systematic review and 09 for meta-analysis as per the inclusion/exclusion criteria. The analysis was made as per the prevalence rate of neurological symptoms in COVID-19 positive patients. The cumulative neurological outcome of SARS-2002 and MERS-2012 was assessed to get the trends which was further tried to correlate the events with the current pandemic. During the analysis severity and outcome of neurological manifestations range from simple headache to vague non-focal complaints to severe neurologic impairment associated with seizure or meningitis.

However, none of the publication had primary or secondary objectives of searching neurological manifestations in the COVID-19 patients and the pathogenic mechanism which will subsequently strengthen the importance to start more prospective clinical trials. The prevalence of neurological signs and symptoms were taken as primary objective. Thereafter, the prevalence of each CNS/PNS symptoms was categorized and their prevalence studied. The selection of Bagheri et al., 2020 may be discussed because they have done the cross-sectional study with the neurological finding and correlated the data with prevalence of the COVID-19 positive patients.

The complete genome sequence analysis showed that the CH/HNQX-3/14 possessed unique deletion regions in the S and ORF3 genes. It was identified as a recombinant strain using phylogenetic analysis and recombination detection program. Further analyses of the full-length sequence suggest that CH/HNQX-3/14 is a natural recombinant between the attenuated vaccine strains (CV777 and DR13) and circulating wild-type strain (CH/ZMDZY/11). The recombination occurred not only in structural protein-coding region (S1 and N genes) but also in non-structural protein-coding region (replicases 1a and ORF3 genes). These results provided new evidence that PEDV strains circulating in China underwent recombination between vaccine and field strains, suggesting that recombination contributes to the genetic diversity of PEDV.

A rapid and accurate diagnosis of these respiratory viruses is essential for an appropriate patient management. Molecular tests are the best detection option due to their high sensitivity and specificity. Seegene’s Allplex™ Respiratory Panel 1 (Allplex RP1) is a real-time one-step RT-PCR assay for the simultaneous detection of FLUAV, FLUBV, HRSV-A and HRSV-B. In addition, it allows the determination of FLUAV subtype (H1, H3 and H1pdm09). OBJECTIVES: This study aims to evaluate Allplex RP1 as a rapid molecular test for the detection of FLUAV, FLUBV, HRSV-A and HRSV-B viruses. STUDY DESIGN: The Allplex RP1 assay will be compared with other two commercial molecular assays, Prodesse ProFlu+ and ProFAST+ (Hologic, Madison, WI, USA), and GeneXpert Flu/RSV XC (Cepheid, USA). RESULTS: Allplex RP1, ProFlu+ and GeneXpert tests showed 95%, 91% and 96% of accuracy; and 94%, 88% and 95% of sensitivity, respectively. Moreover, Allplex RP1 showed a FLUAV subtype sensitivity of 91% and 88% for FLUAV-H1pdm09 and FLUAV-H3 respectively, and ProFAST+ assay showed sensitivities of 100% for both targets. The three assays showed a 100% of specificity and PPV, while the NPV were 84%, 73% and 86% for Allplex RP1, Prodesse and GeneXpert, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, Seegene’s Allplex RP1 assay showed to be highly sensitive, specific, and suitable for detection of FLUV and HRSV, including FLUAV subtyping. In addition, it is also a hands-on-time saving assay due to the automated nucleic acid extraction and PCR setup.","Gimferrer, Laura; Andrés, Cristina; Rando, Ariadna; Piñana, Maria; Codina, Maria Gema; Martin, Maria del Carmen; Fuentes, Francisco; Rubio, Susana; Alcubilla, Pilar; Pumarola, Tomàs; Antón, Andrés",J Clin Virol,353,26

Their etiopathogenesis, including the role of SARS-CoV-2, remains elusive. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of chilblain-like lesions with SARS-CoV-2 infection. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective case series enrolled 17 adolescents who presented with chilblain-like lesions from April 1 to June 30, 2020, at a tertiary referral academic hospital in Italy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Macroscopic (clinical and dermoscopic) and microscopic (histopathologic) analysis contributed to a thorough understanding of the lesions. Nasopharyngeal swab, serologic testing, and in situ hybridization of the skin biopsy specimens were performed to test for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Laboratory tests explored signs of systemic inflammation or thrombophilia. Structural changes in peripheral microcirculation were investigated by capillaroscopy. RESULTS: Of the 17 adolescents (9 [52.9%] male; median [interquartile range] age, 13.2 [12.5-14.3] years) enrolled during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, 16 (94.1%) had bilaterally localized distal erythematous or cyanotic lesions. A triad of red dots (16 [100%]), white rosettes (11 [68.8%]), and white streaks (10 [62.5%]) characterized the dermoscopic picture. Histologic analysis revealed a remodeling of the dermal blood vessels with a lobular arrangement, wall thickening, and a mild perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate. SARS-CoV-2 infection was excluded by molecular and serologic testing. In situ hybridization did not highlight the viral genome in the lesions. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study delineated the clinical, histologic, and laboratory features of chilblain-like lesions that emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic, and its findings do not support their association with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The lesions occurred in otherwise healthy adolescents, had a long but benign course to self-resolution, and were characterized by a microvascular remodeling with perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate but no other signs of vasculitis. These results suggest that chilblain-like lesions do not imply a concomitant SARS-CoV-2 infection. Ongoing studies will help clarify the etiopathogenic mechanisms.","Discepolo, Valentina; Catzola, Andrea; Pierri, Luca; Mascolo, Massimo; Della Casa, Francesca; Vastarella, Maria; Smith, Grace; Travaglino, Antonio; Punziano, Alessandra; Nappa, Paola; Staibano, Stefania; Bruzzese, Eugenia; Fabbrocini, Gabriella; Guarino, Alfredo; Alessio, Maria",JAMA Netw Open,353,11

Current efforts are directed towards the global control and eradication of PPRV, an initiative of the World Organisation for Animal Health and Food and the Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations. A plethora of diagnostic tools for PPR were primarily developed for livestock. New innovative diagnostic tools are needed to detect PPRV in atypical hosts (e.g., Camelidae, Suidae, and Bovinae), in wildlife ecosystems, and in complex field situations. Recent studies confirmed that single-domain antigen binding fragments (nanobodies) derived from heavy-chain-only camelid antibodies have proven to be a powerful tool in diagnostics and therapeutics due to their unique properties, such as small size and strong antigen-binding affinity. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to generate PPRV-reactive nanobodies in order to set a pace for the development of diagnostic and possibly therapeutic nanobodies in the future. Initially, a strategy was developed whereby an alpaca was immunized with PPRV in order to raise an affinity-matured immune response, from which an immune nanobody library was constructed. Following phage display, nine nanobodies that specifically recognise PPRV were identified on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. This study has generated PPRV-reactive nanobodies and have significant implications in the development of cost-effective diagnostic tools in context with the planned eradication of PPR in the world. ABSTRACT: Peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) causes a highly devastating disease, peste des petits ruminants (PPR) of sheep and goats, that threatens food security, small ruminant production, and the conservation of wild small ruminants in many developing countries, especially in Africa. Robust serological and molecular diagnostic tools are available to detect PPRV infection, but they were mainly developed for domestic sheep and goats. The presence of a wide host range for PPRV does present serological diagnostic challenges. New innovative diagnostic tools are needed to detect PPRV in atypical hosts (e.g., Camelidae, Suidae, and Bovinae), in wildlife ecosystems and in complex field situations. Interestingly, single-domain antigen binding fragments (nanobodies) derived from heavy-chain-only camelid antibodies have emerged as a new hope in the development of accurate, rapid, and cost-effective diagnostic tools in veterinary and biomedical fields that are suitable for low-income countries. The main objective of this study was to construct an immune nanobody library to retrieve PPRV-reactive nanobodies that enable the development of diagnostic and therapeutic nanobodies in the future. Here, a strategy was developed whereby an alpaca (Vicugna pacos) was immunized with a live attenuated vaccine strain (PPRV/N/75/1) to raise an affinity-matured immune response in the heavy-chain-only antibody classes. The nanobody gene repertoire was engineered in pMECS-GG phagemid, whereby a ccdB gene (encoding a lethal protein) was substituted by the nanobody gene. An immune nanobody library with approximately sixty-four million independent transformants was constructed, of which 100% contained an insert with the proper size of nanobody gene. Following phage display and biopanning, nine nanobodies that specifically recognise completely inactivated PPRV were identified on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. They showed superb potency in rapidly identifying PPRV, which is likely to open a new perspective in the diagnosis and possible treatment of PPR infection.","Kinimi, Edson; Muyldermans, Serge; Vincke, Cécile; Odongo, Steven; Kock, Richard; Parida, Satya; Mahapatra, Mana; Misinzo, Gerald",Animals (Basel),353,1

Although the predominant clinical feature of COVID-19 is an acute respiratory syndrome of varying severity, ranging from mild symptomatic interstitial pneumonia to acute respiratory distress syndrome, the cardiovascular system can be involved with several facets. As many as 40% hospitalized patients presenting with COVID-19 have pre-existing history of cardiovascular disease and current estimates report a proportion of myocardial injury in COVID-19 patients ranging up to 12%. Multiple pathways have been advocated to explain this finding and the related clinical scenarios, encompassing local and systemic inflammatory response and oxygen supply-demand imbalance. From a clinical point of view, cardiac involvement during COVID-19 may present a wide spectrum of severity ranging from subclinical myocardial injury to well-defined clinical entities (myocarditis, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism and heart failure), whose incidence and prognostic implications are currently largely unknown due to a significant lack of imaging data.

Blood HCQ concentrations are directly correlated with disease activity in rheumatic diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus. We sought to model how changes in HCQ dosage will best maintain sufficient blood HCQ concentrations for the longest period of time in order to avoid potential future flares. METHODS: A one‐compartment pharmacokinetic model was used to predict mean blood HCQ concentrations. Monte Carlo simulations with 10‐fold inflated model parameter variance was utilized to assess the impact of variability. RESULTS: Maintenance of 400 mg/d resulted in mean therapeutic whole‐blood HCQ concentrations that exceeded 700 ng/ml for 10.5 days, whereas HCQ rationing by reducing the dose by half resulted in the mean concentration remaining above 700 ng/ml for 2.4 days (net gain = 8 days). Variability analysis demonstrates that results may differ at the individual level, dependent on baseline blood HCQ concentrations. CONCLUSION: Although mean blood concentrations exceed 700 ng/ml for a longer time if patients maintain their full dose of HCQ, more information is needed to fully understand the elimination of HCQ at the patient level, particularly the contribution of tissue stores of HCQ transiting back into the blood.","Scheetz, Marc H.; Konig, Maximilian F.; Robinson, Philip C.; Sparks, Jeffrey A.; Kim, Alfred H.J.",ACR Open Rheumatol,353,28

The producers of the documentary sought to spread misinformation and conspiracy theories and to discredit scientific experts using a sophisticated disinformation campaign. They set out to accomplish this by coaching citizens toward activism to maximize the speed at which the documentary propagated and decrease positive sentiments toward public health interventions. Applying techniques from social network analysis in conjunction with a formative content analysis of Twitter data, we examined the effectiveness of the Plandemic disinformation campaign as a case study of social engineering during the COVID-19 pandemic. By comparing the Twitter network's community structure and communication patterns before and after the release of the film, we demonstrate the Plandemic campaign to have been effective for two reasons. First, the campaign established a decentralized information sharing network on Twitter by coaching low-reach social media users to mass share the documentary, effectively subverting efforts to gatekeep its misinformation. Second, the campaign amplified negative sentiments regarding vaccination and containment measures among conspiracy theorists. These effects possibly have an indirect impact on the public's willingness to comply with public health measures. Our results show the necessity of further research about sophisticated social experiments such as the Plandemic disinformation campaign and provide important insights for policy-making to combat the spread of health misinformation during public health crises.","Nazar, Shahin; Pieters, Toine",Front Public Health,353,20

The identification of potential symptoms has been reported to be a useful tool for clinical decision-making in emergency departments to avoid overload and improve the quality of care. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performances of symptoms as a diagnostic tool for SARS -CoV-2 infection. METHODS: An observational, cross-sectional, prospective and analytical study was carried out, during the period of time from April 14 to July 21, 2020. Data (demographic variables, medical history, respiratory and non-respiratory symptoms) were collected by emergency physicians. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was made using SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. The diagnostic accuracy of these characteristics for COVID-19 was evaluated by calculating the positive and negative likelihood ratios. A Mantel-Haenszel and multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the association of symptoms with COVID-19. RESULTS: A prevalence of 53.72% of SARS-CoV-2 infection was observed. The symptom with the highest sensitivity was cough 71%, and a specificity of 52.68%. The symptomatological scale, constructed from 6 symptoms, obtained a sensitivity of 83.45% and a specificity of 32.86%, taking ≥2 symptoms as a cut-off point. The symptoms with the greatest association with SARS-CoV-2 were: anosmia odds ratio (OR) 3.2 (95% CI; 2.52–4.17), fever OR 2.98 (95% CI; 2.47–3.58), dyspnea OR 2.9 (95% CI; 2.39–3.51]) and cough OR 2.73 (95% CI: 2.27–3.28). CONCLUSION: The combination of ≥2 symptoms / signs (fever, cough, anosmia, dyspnea and oxygen saturation < 93%, and headache) results in a highly sensitivity model for a quick and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19, and should be used in the absence of ancillary diagnostic studies. Symptomatology, alone and in combination, may be an appropriate strategy to use in the emergency department to guide the behaviors to respond to the disease.

We seek to systematically review the available evidence regarding the anticoagulation approach to prevent venous thromboembolism (VTE) among COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care units. Electronic databases were searched for studies reporting venous thromboembolic events in patients admitted to the intensive care unit receiving any type of anticoagulation (prophylactic or therapeutic). The pooled prevalence (and 95% confidence interval [CI]) of VTE among patients receiving anticoagulant were calculated using the random-effects model. Subgroup pooled analyses were performed with studies reported prophylactic anticoagulation alone and with studies reported mixed prophylactic and therapeutic anticoagulation. We included twelve studies (8 Europe; 2 UK; 1 each from the US and China) in our systematic review and meta-analysis. All studies utilized LMWH or unfractionated heparin as their pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis, either prophylactic doses or therapeutic doses. Seven studies reported on the proportion of patients with the previous history of VTE (range 0–10%). The pooled prevalence of VTE among ICU patients receiving prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation across all studies was 31% (95% CI 20–43%). Subgroup pooled analysis limited to studies reported prophylactic anticoagulation alone and mixed (therapeutic and prophylactic anticoagulation) reported pooled prevalences of VTE of 38% (95% CI 10–70%) and 27% (95% CI 17–40%) respectively. With a high prevalence of thromboprophylaxis failure among COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care units, individualised rather than protocolised VTE thromboprophylaxis would appear prudent at interim.

We describe a novel cloud based HIPAA compliant and accessible education platform which simulates a live radiology workstation for continued education of first year radiology (R1) residents, with an emphasis on call preparation and peer to peer resident learning. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three tools were used in our education model: Pacsbin (Orion Medical Technologies, Baltimore, MD, pacsbin.com), Zoom (Zoom Video Communications, San Jose, CA, zoom.us) and Google Classroom (Google, Mountain View, CA, classroom.google.com). A senior radiology resident (R2-R4) (n = 7) driven workflow was established to provide scrollable Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) based case collections to the R1 residents (n = 9) via Pacsbin. A centralized classroom was created using Google Classroom for assignments, reports and discussion where attending radiologists could review content for accuracy. Daily case collections over an eight week period from March to May were reviewed via Zoom video conference readout in small groups consisting of a R2-R4 teacher and R1 residents. Surveys were administered to R1 residents, R2-4 residents, and attending radiologist participants. RESULTS: 100% of R1 residents felt this model improved their confidence and knowledge to take independent call. 78% of the R1 residents (n = 7/9) demonstrated strong interest in continuing the project after pandemic related restrictions are lifted. Based on a Likert “helpfulness” scale of 1-5 with 5 being most helpful, the project earned an overall average rating of 4.9. Two R2-R4 teachers demonstrated increased interest in pursuing academic radiology. CONCLUSION: In response to unique pandemic circumstances, our institution implemented a novel cloud based distance learning solution to simulate the radiology workstation. This platform helped continue the program's educational mission, offered first year residents increased call preparation, and promoted peer to peer learning. This approach to case based learning could be used at other institutions to educate residents.","McRoy, Casey; Patel, Lakir; Gaddam, Durga Sivacharan; Rothenberg, Steven; Herring, Allison; Hamm, Jacob; Chelala, Lydia; Weinstein, Joseph; Smith, Elana; Awan, Omer",Acad Radiol,353,7

DESIGN: PubMed, SCOPUS and Embase were searched for studies reporting data on MSI/dMMR in PDAC up to 30 November 2019. Histological and molecular data of MSI/dMMR PDAC were compared with non-MSI/dMMR PDAC and with PDAC reference cohorts (including SEER database and The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network - TCGA project). RESULTS: Overall, 34 studies with 8323 patients with PDAC were included in the systematic review. MSI/dMMR demonstrated a very low prevalence in PDAC (around 1%–2%).

Data on survival are still unclear. CONCLUSION: PDAC showing typical medullary or mucinous/colloid histology should be routinely examined for MSI/dMMR status using specific tests (immunohistochemistry, followed by MSI-PCR in cases with doubtful results).

Body temperature can be measured using thermal infrared imaging, a safe, non-contact method that relies on the emissivity of the skin being known to provide accurate readings. Skin pigmentation affects the absorption of visible light and enables us to see variations in skin colour. Pigmentation may also affect the absorption of infrared radiation and thus affect thermal imaging. Human skin has an accepted emissivity of 0.98 but the effect of different skin pigmentation on this value is not known. In this study, we investigated the influence of different skin pigmentation on thermal emissivity in 65 adult volunteers. METHODS: A reference object of known emissivity (electrical tape) was applied to participant’s skin on the inner upper arm. Tape and arm were imaged simultaneously using a thermal infrared camera. The emissivity was set on the camera to the known value for electrical tape. The emissivity was altered manually until the skin temperature using thermal imaging software was equal to the initial tape temperature. This provided the calculated emissivity value of the skin. Participants were grouped according to skin pigmentation, quantified using the Fitzpatrick skin phototyping scale and reflectance spectrophotometry. Differences in emissivity values between skin pigmentation groups were assessed by one-way ANOVA. RESULTS: The mean calculated emissivity for the 65 participants was 0.972 (range 0.96–0.99). No significant differences in emissivity were observed between participants when grouped by skin pigmentation according to the Fitzpatrick scale (p = 0.859) or reflectance spectrophotometry (p = 0.346). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that skin pigmentation does not affect thermal emissivity measurement of skin temperature using thermal infrared imaging. This study will aid further research into the application of thermal infrared imaging as a screening or bedside diagnostic tool in clinical practice.","Charlton, Matthew; Stanley, Sophie A.; Whitman, Zoë; Wenn, Victoria; Coats, Timothy J.; Sims, Mark; Thompson, Jonathan P.",PLoS One,353,20

We developed a portable airborne particle-collection system to measure the viral load; it is equipped with an air sampler to draw air and pass it through a gelatin membrane filter connected to a cone-shaped, megaphone-like device to guide the cough airflow to the membrane. The membrane was dissolved in a medium, and the viral load was measured using quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and a plaque assay. The approximate viral recovery rate of this system was 10% in simulation experiments to collect and quantify the viral particles aerosolized by a nebulizer. Using this system, cough samples were collected from 56 influenza A patients. The total viral detection rate was 41% (23/56), and the viral loads varied significantly (from <10, less than the detection limit, to 2240 viral gene copies/cough). Viable viruses were detected from 3 samples with ≤18 plaque forming units per cough sample. The virus detection rates were similar among different groups of patients infected with different viral subtypes and during different influenza seasons. Among patients who did not receive antiviral treatment, viruses were detected in one of six cases in the vaccinated group and four of six cases in the unvaccinated group. We found cases with high viral titers in throat swabs or oral secretions but very low or undetectable in coughs and vice versa suggesting other possible anatomical sites where the viruses might be mixed into the cough.

This rational, equilibrium system produces an elegant economics, but is restrictive and often unrealistic. Complexity economics relaxes these assumptions. It assumes that agents differ, that they have imperfect information about other agents and must, therefore, try to make sense of the situation they face. Agents explore, react and constantly change their actions and strategies in response to the outcome they mutually create. The resulting outcome may not be in equilibrium and may display patterns and emergent phenomena not visible to equilibrium analysis.

Multilevel logistic regressions were used taking into account heterogeneity in the level of regional development. The utilization of health records and health education was less than 40% and varied widely across regions. Social integration was related to a higher likelihood of utilization of health records and health education. Moreover, sociocultural adaptation had a stronger effect on the utilization of health records in developed regions than in developing regions, and structural integration was strongly and positively related to the utilization of health education in developed regions.

A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,18.663607,10.050286,2021-08-24,"The present study investigated variables potentially associated with a lack of concern about COVID-19 and belief in the conspiracy theory that China is responsible for the virus. In particular, the study looked at Authoritarianism, Conspiracy Beliefs, gender, and consistency of handedness as predictors of nine Likert-type items gauging attitudes, behavior, and beliefs regarding the virus. Initial analyses showed that Authoritarianism predicted less concern about the impact of the virus on health, less mask wearing, and a stronger belief in China’s responsibility for the illness. Conspiracy Beliefs were associated with a stronger belief in China’s responsibility. Women expressed greater degrees of concern about their own and others’ health and about the financial wellbeing of others. In order to reduce the number of dimensions, and thus the number of tests that could yield a type one error, the nine items were then submitted to a principal components analysis which yielded a “Concern about COVID” factor and a “Blame for China” factor. Authoritarianism is generally associated with less concern about the virus. In addition, men showed less concern about the virus overall than women. Both Authoritarianism and Conspiracy Beliefs accounted for unique variance in blame on China for the virus.","Prichard, Eric C.; Christman, Stephen D.",Front Psychol,353,0

Development of methods that incorporate labels at specific atomic positions within each nucleotide promises to expand the size range of RNAs that can be studied by NMR. Using recombinantly expressed enzymes and chemically synthesized ribose and nucleobase, we have developed an inexpensive, rapid chemo-enzymatic method to label ATP and GTP site specifically and in high yields of up to 90%. We incorporated these nucleotides into RNAs with sizes ranging from 27 to 59 nucleotides using in vitro transcription: A-Site (27 nt), the iron responsive elements (29 nt), a fluoride riboswitch from Bacillus anthracis (48 nt), and a frame-shifting element from a human corona virus (59 nt). Finally, we showcase the improvement in spectral quality arising from reduced crowding and narrowed linewidths, and accurate analysis of NMR relaxation dispersion (CPMG) and TROSY-based CEST experiments to measure μs-ms time scale motions, and an improved NOESY strategy for resonance assignment. Applications of this selective labeling technology promises to reduce difficulties associated with chemical shift overlap and rapid signal decay that have made it challenging to study the structure and dynamics of large RNAs beyond the 50 nt median size found in the PDB.","Longhini, Andrew P.; LeBlanc, Regan M.; Becette, Owen; Salguero, Carolina; Wunderlich, Christoph H.; Johnson, Bruce A.; D'Souza, Victoria M.; Kreutz, Christoph; Dayie, T.

In this study, we evaluated the association between use of methylprednisolone and key clinical outcomes. METHODS: Clinical outcomes associated with the use of methylprednisolone were assessed in an unmatched, case-control study; a subset of patients also underwent propensity-score matching. Patients were admitted between March 1 and April 12, 2020. The primary outcome was ventilator-free days by 28 days after admission. Secondary outcomes included extubation, mortality, discharge, positive cultures, and hyperglycemia. RESULTS: A total of 117 patients met inclusion criteria. Propensity matching yielded a cohort of 42 well-matched pairs. Groups were similar except for hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin use, which were more common in patients who did not receive methylprednisolone. Mean ventilator free-days were significantly higher in patients treated with methylprednisolone (6.21±7.45 versus 3.14±6.22; P = 0.044). The probability of extubation was also increased in patients receiving methylprednisolone (45% versus 21%; P = 0.021), and there were no significant differences in mortality (19% versus 36%; P = 0.087). In a multivariable linear regression analysis, only methylprednisolone use was associated with higher number of ventilator-free days (P = 0.045). The incidence of positive cultures and hyperglycemia were similar between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Methylprednisolone was associated with increased ventilator-free days and higher probability of extubation in a propensity-score matched cohort.

This study analyses the effectiveness of the new triage system and structural reorganization in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted in the Emergency and Trauma Department, Hospital Kuala Lumpur (ETDHKL). The implementation of a binary triage system separates patients with risk of COVID-19 who present with fever and respiratory symptoms from other patients. Data on exposed HCWs to COVID-19 patients were captured pre-restructuring and post-restructuring of the emergency department and analysed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: A total of 846 HCWs were involved in this study. Pre-restructuring reported 542 HCWs exposed to COVID-19 patients while post-restructuring reported 122. Using the four categorical exposure risks for HCWs which are no identifiable risk, low risk, medium risk, and high risk, the number of HCWs exposed during pre-restructuring were 15(1.8%), 504 (59.6%), 15 (1.8%), and 8 (0.9%), respectively, while post-restructuring the numbers were 122 (14.4%), 8 (0.9%), 109 (12.9%), and 5 (0.1%), respectively. There was a 77.5% reduction in the number of exposed HCWs after our implementation of the new system (542 vs 122). CONCLUSION: A binary triage system based on severity and infectivity and supported with structural reorganization can be effective in reducing HCWs COVID-19 exposure.","Abd.

Design - Matched cohort study. Cases are matched by age, gender, ethnicity, index of multiple deprivation, lower tier local authority region, and sample date of positive specimen, and differing only by detectability of the spike protein gene using the TaqPath assay - a proxy measure of VOC-202012/1 infection. Setting - United Kingdom, Pillar 2 COVID-19 testing centres using the taqPath assay. Participants - 54,773 pairs of participants testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Pillar 2 between 1st October 2020 and 29th January 2021. Main outcome measures - Death within 28 days of first positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Results - There is a high probability that the risk of mortality is increased by infection with VOC-202012/01 (p <0.001). The mortality hazard ratio associated with infection with VOC-202012/1 compared to infection with previous strains is 1.7 (95% CI 1.3 - 2.2) in patients who have tested positive for COVID-19 in the community. In this comparatively low risk group, this represents an increase of deaths from 1.8 in 1000 to 3.1 in 1000 detected cases. Conclusions - If this finding is generalisable to other populations, VOC-202012/1 infections have the potential to cause substantial additional mortality over and previously circulating variants. Healthcare capacity planning, national and international control policies are all impacted by this finding, with increased mortality lending weight to the argument that further coordinated and stringent measures are justified to reduce deaths from SARS-CoV-2.","Challen, R.; Brooks-Pollock, E.; Read, J.

X-ray imaging, although limited to specific visualizations, may be helpful for the diagnosis. In this study, the problem of automatic classification of pulmonary diseases, including the recently emerged COVID-19, from X-ray images, is considered. METHODS: Deep Learning has proven to be a remarkable method to extract massive high-dimensional features from medical images. Specifically, in this paper, the state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network called Mobile Net is employed and trained from scratch to investigate the importance of the extracted features for the classification task. A large-scale dataset of 3905 X-ray images, corresponding to 6 diseases, is utilized for training MobileNet v2, which has been proven to achieve excellent results in related tasks. RESULTS: Training the CNNs from scratch outperforms the other transfer learning techniques, both in distinguishing the X-rays between the seven classes and between Covid-19 and non-Covid-19. A classification accuracy between the seven classes of 87.66% is achieved. Besides, this method achieves 99.18% accuracy, 97.36% Sensitivity, and 99.42% Specificity in the detection of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that training CNNs from scratch may reveal vital biomarkers related but not limited to the COVID-19 disease, while the top classification accuracy suggests further examination of the X-ray imaging potential.","Apostolopoulos, Ioannis D.; Aznaouridis, Sokratis I.; Tzani, Mpesiana A.",J Med Biol Eng,353,26

SARS and related coronaviruses and astroviruses all possess a motif at the 3′ end of their RNA genomes, called the s2m, whose pathogenic importance is inferred from its rigorous sequence conservation in an otherwise rapidly mutable RNA genome. We find that this extreme conservation is clearly explained by the requirement to form a highly structured RNA whose unique tertiary structure includes a sharp 90° kink of the helix axis and several novel longer-range tertiary interactions. The tertiary base interactions create a tunnel that runs perpendicular to the main helical axis whose interior is negatively charged and binds two magnesium ions. These unusual features likely form interaction surfaces with conserved host cell components or other reactive sites required for virus function. Based on its conservation in viral pathogen genomes and its absence in the human genome, we suggest that these unusual structural features in the s2m RNA element are attractive targets for the design of anti-viral therapeutic agents. Structural genomics has sought to deduce protein function based on three-dimensional homology. Here we have extended this approach to RNA by proposing potential functions for a rigorously conserved set of RNA tertiary structural interactions that occur within the SARS RNA genome itself. Based on tertiary structural comparisons, we propose the s2m RNA binds one or more proteins possessing an oligomer-binding-like fold, and we suggest a possible mechanism for SARS viral RNA hijacking of host protein synthesis, both based upon observed s2m RNA macromolecular mimicry of a relevant ribosomal RNA fold.","Robertson, Michael P; Igel, Haller; Baertsch, Robert; Haussler, David; Ares, Manuel; Scott, William G",PLoS Biol,353,16

In general, viruses tend to be restricted to the natural host species which they infect. From time to time viruses cross the host‐range barrier expanding their host range. However, in very rare cases cross‐species transfer is followed by the establishment and persistence of a virus in the new host species, which may result in disease. Recent examples of viruses that have crossed the species barrier from animal reservoirs to humans are hantavirus, haemorrhagic fever viruses, arboviruses, Nipah and Hendra viruses, avian influenza virus (AI), monkeypox virus, and the SARS‐associated coronavirus (SARS‐CoV). The opportunities for cross‐species transfer of mammalian viruses have increased in recent years due to increased contact between humans and animal reservoirs. However, it is difficult to predict when such events will take place since the viral adaptation that is needed to accomplish this is multifactorial and stochastic. Against this background the intensified use of viruses and their genetically modified variants as viral gene transfer vectors for biomedical research, experimental gene therapy and for live‐vector vaccines is a cause for concern. This review addresses a number of potential risk factors and their implications for activities with viral vectors from the perspective of cross‐species transfer of viruses in nature, with emphasis on the occurrence of host‐range mutants resulting from either cell culture or tropism engineering. The issues are raised with the intention to assist in risk assessments for activities with vector viruses.

Therefore, a quantitative risk assessment for otologic surgery would be desirable. This study aims to quantitatively compare the risk of perioperative droplet formation between microscopic and endoscopic approaches. STUDY DESIGN: Experimental research. SETTING: Temporal bone laboratory. METHODS: The middle ear of whole head specimens was injected with fluorescein (0.2 mg/10 mL) before endoscopic and microscopic epitympanectomy and mastoidectomy. Fluorescent droplet deposition on the surgical table was recorded under ultraviolet light, quantified, and compared among the interventions. Drilling time, droplet proportion, fluorescein intensity, and droplet size were assessed for every procedure. RESULTS: A total of 12 procedures were performed: 4 endoscopic epitympanectomies, 4 microscopic epitympanectomies, and 4 mastoidectomies. The mean (SD) proportion of fluorescein droplets was 0.14‰ (0.10‰) for endoscopic epitympanectomy and 0.64‰ (0.31‰) for microscopic epitympanectomy. During mastoidectomy, the deposition of droplets was 8.77‰ (6.71‰). Statistical comparison based on a mixed effects model revealed a significant increase (0.50‰) in droplet deposition during microscopic epitympanectomy as compared with endoscopic epitympanectomy (95% CI, 0.16‰ to 0.84‰). CONCLUSIONS: There is considerable droplet generation during otologic surgery, and this represents a risk for the spread of airborne infectious diseases. The endoscopic technique offers the lowest risk of droplet formation as compared with microscopic approaches, with a significant 4.5-fold reduction of droplets between endoscopic and microscopic epitympanectomy and a 62-fold reduction between endoscopic epitympanectomy and cortical mastoidectomy.","Anschuetz, Lukas; Yacoub, Abraam; Buetzer, Tobias; Fernandez, Ignacio J.; Wimmer, Wilhelm; Caversaccio, Marco",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,353,23

This study examined the determinants of the timing to implement an intervention. Through an impact analysis, the study explored the effects of the interventions and the potential risks of removing them under the context of reopening the economy. Method A content analysis identified nine types of mitigation interventions and the timing at which states enacted these strategies. A proportional hazard model, a multiple-event survival model, and a random-effect spatial error panel model in conjunction with a robust method analyzing zero-inflated and skewed outcomes were employed in the data analysis. Findings To our knowledge, we provided in this article the first explicit analysis of the timing, determinants, and impacts of mitigation interventions for all states and Washington DC in the United States during the first five weeks of the pandemic. Unlike other studies that evaluate the Stay-at-Home order by using simulated data, the current study employed the real data of various case counts of Covid-19. The study obtained two meritorious findings: (1) states with a higher prevalence of Covid-19 cases per 10,000 population reacted more slowly to the outbreak, suggesting that some states may have missed the optimal timing to prevent the wide spread of the Covid-19 disease; and (2) of nine mitigation measures, three (non-essential business closure, large-gathering bans, and restaurant/bar limitations) showed positive impacts on reducing cumulative cases, new cases, and death rates across states. Interpretation The opposite direction of the prevalence rate on the timing of issuing the mitigation interventions partially explains why the Covid-19 caseload in the U.S. remains high. A swift implementation of social distancing is crucial-the key is not whether such measures should be taken but when. Because there is no preventive vaccine and because there are few potentially effective treatments, recent reductions in new cases and deaths must be due, in large part, to the social interventions delivered by states. The study suggests that the policy of reopening economy needs to be implemented carefully.","Guo, S.; An, R.; McBride, T. D.; Yu, D.; Fu, L.; Yang, Y.",,353,9

At day 73, an E484K substitution in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) occurred, followed at day 80 by an insertion in the NTD N5 loop containing a new glycan sequon, which generated a variant completely resistant to plasma neutralization. Computational modeling predicts that the deletion and insertion in loops N3 and N5 prevent binding of neutralizing antibodies.

Of interest, 16 of these patients (53%) exhibited hypercapnia (PaCO(2)> 45 mm Hg), and 10 hypercapnic events occurred within 1 week of admission. The occurence of hypencapnia or CO(2)retention and was accompanied by myalgias. NPPV was instituted in 28 patients; one was intolerant of NPPV. In the remaining 27 patients, NPPV was initiated 1.2 ± 1.6 days after ARF onset. An hour of NPPV therapy led to significant increases in PaO(2)and PaO(2)/FiO(2)and a decrease in respiratory rate (p< 0.01). Endotracheal intubation was required in one third of the patients (9 of 27) who initially had a favorable response to NPPV. Remarkable pulmonary barotrauma was noticed in 7 of all 120 patients (5.8%) and in 6 of those (22%) on NPPV. The overall fatality rate at 13 weeks was 6.7% (8/120); it was higher (26.7%) in those needing NPPV. No caregiver contracted SARS. We conclude that NPPV is a feasible and appropriate treatment for ARF occurring as a result of a SARS infection.","Han, Fang; Jiang, Yu Y.; Zheng, Jian H.; Gao, Zhan C.; He, Quan Y.",Sleep Breath,353,20

A convenience sample of 117 participants completed an online voluntary and anonymous survey between April and July 2020. It contained a sociodemographic section, the Professional Quality of Life questionnaire V, the work engagement scale, and the scale of self-care behaviors for clinical psychologists. Results show that healthcare workers have an average quality of life with high levels of compassion satisfaction and average levels of compassion fatigue and burnout. Data also indicate that the sample frequently engaged in self-care practices and had high levels of work engagement. The regression analyses reveal that gender, the number of patients per week, the perceived fairness of the salary, among other variables are possible predictors of professional quality of life, frequency of self-care practices, and engagement. This study contributes to the understanding of these variables among healthcare professionals in Ecuador.

COVID-19 has caused at least 1.7 million deaths worldwide and over 300,000 in the United States. Recently, two promising vaccines are being administered in several countries. However, there remains an urgent need for a therapeutic treatment for COVID-19 patients with severe respiratory damage that can lead to intensive care, prolonged hospitalization, or mortality. Moreover, an increasing population of patients manifest lingering disabling symptoms (called Long Haulers). Here, we tested the efficacy of a recombinant neural epidermal growth factor like 1 protein variant (NELL1-NV1) in a COVID-19 mouse model, transgenic mice expressing the human angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor (tg-mice hACE2) infected with SARS-CoV-2. The administration of NELL1-NV1 to SARS-CoV-2-infected tg-mice hACE2 significantly improved clinical health score and increased survival. Analyses of bronchoalveolar (BAL) fluid demonstrated decreased levels of several cytokines and chemokines (IFN-γ, IL-10, IL-12 p70, CXCL-10/IP-10, MIG and Rantes), in NV1-treated treated mice compared to controls. Cytokines including IL-1α, IL-9, IL-6, LIX/CXCL5, KC/CXCL1, MIP-2/CXCL2, MIP-1α/CCL3, and G-CSF, critical to immune responses such as neutrophil recruitment, viral clearance and vascularization, were increased compared to controls. Our data suggest the potential of NELL1-NV1-based therapy to mitigate the cytokine storm, modulate the abnormal immune response and repair respiratory tissue damage in COVID-19 patients.","Biswas, Roopa; Eaker, Shannon; Soni, Dharmendra Kumar; Kar, Swagata; LoBato, Denae; Culiat, Cymbeline",bioRxiv,353,16

Strategies that provide a rapid and easily translatable means of assessing virus‐specific T‐cell responses provide an opportunity to monitor the impact of vaccine rollouts in the community. In this study, we assessed whether our recently developed SARS‐CoV‐2 whole‐blood assay could be used effectively to analyse T‐cell responses following vaccination. METHODS: Following a median of 15 days after the first dose of the ChAdOx1‐S (AstraZeneca(®)) vaccine, peripheral blood was isolated from 58 participants. Blood was incubated overnight with an overlapping set of spike protein peptides and assessed for cytokine production using a cytometric bead array. RESULTS: The majority of vaccine recipients (51/58) generated a T helper 1 response (IFN‐γ and/or IL‐2) following a single dose of ChAdOx1‐S. The magnitude of the IFN‐γ and IL‐2 response strongly correlated in vaccine recipients. While the production of other cytokines was evident in individuals who did not generate IFN‐γ and IL‐2, they showed no correlation in magnitude, nor did we see a correlation between sex or age and the magnitude of the response. CONCLUSIONS: The whole‐blood cytokine assay provides a rapid approach to assessing T‐cell immunity against SARS‐CoV‐2 in vaccine recipients. While the majority of participants generated a robust SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific T‐cell response following their first dose, some did not, demonstrating the likely importance of the booster dose in improving T‐cell immunity.","Lineburg, Katie E; Neller, Michelle A; Ambalathingal, George R; Le Texier, Laetitia; Raju, Jyothy; Swaminathan, Srividhya; Lekieffre, Lea; Smith, Caitlyn; Rehan, Sweera; Crooks, Pauline; Panikkar, Archana; Srihari, Sriganesh; Khanna, Rajiv; Smith, Corey",Clin Transl Immunology,353,1

We have isolated cl-2-derived variant viruses resistant to neutralization by monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for the spike (S) protein of cl-2. The variants MM6 and MM13, selected by the MAbs specific for the JHMV S protein, were revealed to have a point mutation located within the N-terminal 100 amino acids (aa) of the S1 protein. The variants MM56, MM85, and MM78, selected by MAbs specific for the larger S protein of JHMV, were shown to have a deletion composed of about 150 aa located in the middle of the S1 subunit (MM56 and MM85) or one amino acid deletion, aspattic acid at number 543 from the N-terminus of the S1 (MM78). These five MAb-resistant variants were not different from cl-2 in growth pattern on cultured DBT cells. MM6 and MM13 were shown to be highly neurovirulent for 4-week-old Lewis rats, growing to high titers in the brain and causing as high an incidence of neurological disease and death as the parental cl-2. In contrast, MM56 and MM85 were nonneurovirulent for rats. They did not cause any central nervous system disorders nor did they multiply in the rat brains. MM78 showed intermediate neurovirulence as well as intermediate growth potential in the rat brain. However, there was no apparent difference in neurovirulence between the parental and the MAb-resistant variants for mice; all of these viruses showed high neurovirulence for mice. These results suggest that the domain composed of about 150 aa in the middle of the S1 is critical for high neurovirulence of JHMV for rats. Furthermore, it is suggested that the neurovirulence of cl-2 for mice is controlled by a different viral factor.","Taguchi, Fumihiro; Kubo, Hideyuki; Takahashi, Hiromi; Suzuki, Hideka",Virology,353,24

A promising strategy to block the infection consists of using a mutant of the human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a decoy to compete with endogenous ACE2 for the binding to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, which decreases the ability of the virus to enter the host cell. Here, using a computational framework based on the 2D Zernike formalism we investigate details of the molecular binding and evaluate the changes in ACE2-Spike binding compatibility upon mutations occurring in the ACE2 side of the molecular interface. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method by comparing our results with experimental binding affinities changes upon ACE2 mutations, separating ones that increase or decrease binding affinity with an Area Under the ROC curve ranging from 0.66 to 0.93, depending on the magnitude of the effects analyzed. Importantly, the iteration of our approach leads to the identification of a set of ACE2 mutants characterized by an increased shape complementarity with Spike. We investigated the physico-chemical properties of these ACE2 mutants and propose them as bona fide candidates for Spike recognition.","Rienzo, Lorenzo Di; Monti, Michele; Milanetti, Edoardo; Miotto, Mattia; Boffi, Alberto; Tartaglia, Gian Gaetano; Ruocco, Giancarlo",Comput Struct Biotechnol J,353,33

The disease is rapidly spread around the world causing thousands of deaths and posing critical challenges for public health and clinical research in the world. The outbreak was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a public health emergency of international concern. Nowadays, there are more than 18 millions of confirmed cases of coronavirus across the world with a total of 702,903 deaths [2]. In Morocco, there are 28,500 confirmed cases and 345 deaths. Forecasts for the cumulative number of confirmed, recovered, active and death cases were recently provided [3]. To manage the pandemic spread several countries adopted proactive and preventive measures including home confinement of the population. However, there is evidence that these measures, particularly home confinement, can cause unprecedented disruption in the well-being of the population. Being forced to stay at home and the daily activities’ restrictions could impact the citizens’ health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and behavior-related lifestyle. It has been reported that the COVID-19 pandemic has an impact on psychological behaviors [4], mental health [5] and anxiety/depression [6]. The Moroccan population was under home confinement from March 20, 2020. Assessing rapidly and simply the HRQoL during crisis such as the home confinement is a challenge of interest to provide speedy information to authorities which allow best management of damages yielding in crisis situation. The EQ-5D instrument is a generic questionnaire developed by the Euroqol group for measuring the HRQoL by combining five health dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) [7]. The EQ-5D instrument is translated into more than 300 languages and exhibit good reliability and validity in both patients and general population. Herein, we used the EQ-5D-5L instrument to assess for the first time the impact of the home confinement on the HRQoL. Also, we evaluated the changes in behaviors by asking some questions related to lifestyle before and during the home confinement. These data can help the Moroccan authorities and other countries to more understand the impact of this crisis on citizens and therefore to set up adequate protocols for managing the post-confinement or possible future crisis. We provided two datasets: (1) data we collected before confinement from a sample of 484 individuals describing their HRQoL [8] and (2) data we collected during the home confinement period from a sample of 537 individuals describing their HRQoL and behavior-related lifestyle.","Azizi, Asmaa; Achak, Doha; Aboudi, Khalid; Saad, Elmadani; Nejjari, Chakib; Nouira, Youness; Hilali, Abderraouf; Youlyouz-Marfak, Ibtissam; Marfak, Abdelghafour",Data Brief,353,20

However, current understanding of SARS-CoV-2 humoral dynamics and longevity is conflicting. METHODS: The Co-Stars study prospectively enrolled 3679 healthcare workers to comprehensively characterize the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S), receptor-binding-domain (RBD) and nucleoprotein (N) antibodies in parallel. Participants screening seropositive had serial monthly serological testing for a maximum of 7 months with the Mesoscale Discovery Assay. Survival analysis determined the proportion of sero-reversion while two hierarchical Gamma models predicted the upper- and lower-bounds of long-term antibody trajectory. RESULTS: A total of 1163 monthly samples were provided from 349 seropositive participants. At 200 days post-symptoms, >95% of participants had detectable S-antibodies compared to 75% with detectable N-antibodies. S-antibody was predicted to remain detectable in 95% of participants until 465 days [95%CI 370-575] using a 'continuous-decay' model and indefinitely using a 'decay-to-plateau' model to account for antibody secretion by long-lived plasma cells. S-antibody titers correlated strongly with surrogate neutralization in-vitro (R 2=0.72). N-antibodies, however, decayed rapidly with a half-life of 60 days [95%CI 52-68]. CONCLUSIONS: The Co-STAR's study data presented here provides evidence for long-term persistence of neutralizing S-antibodies. This has important implications for the duration of functional immunity following SARS-CoV-2 infection. In contrast, the rapid decay of N-antibodies must be considered in future seroprevalence studies and public health decision-making. This is the first study to establish a mathematical framework capable of predicting long-term humoral dynamics following SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Grandjean, Louis; Saso, Anja; Ortiz, Arturo Torres; Lam, Tanya; Hatcher, James; Thistlethwayte, Rosie; Harris, Mark; Best, Timothy; Johnson, Marina; Wagstaffe, Helen; Ralph, Elizabeth; Mai, Annabelle; Colijn, Caroline; Breuer, Judith; Buckland, Matthew; Gilmour, Kimberly; Goldblatt, David",Clin. infect. dis,353,1

Despite the recent advent of vaccines, behavioral approaches remain an integral part of reducing the spread of COVID-19 and other respiratory illnesses. The aim of this study was to utilize the functionality and the spread of smartwatches to develop a smartwatch application to identify motion signatures that are mapped accurately to face touching. Participants (n = 10, five women, aged 20–83) performed 10 physical activities classified into face touching (FT) and non-face touching (NFT) categories in a standardized laboratory setting. We developed a smartwatch application on Samsung Galaxy Watch to collect raw accelerometer data from participants. Data features were extracted from consecutive non-overlapping windows varying from 2 to 16 s. We examined the performance of state-of-the-art machine learning methods on face-touching movement recognition (FT vs. NFT) and individual activity recognition (IAR): logistic regression, support vector machine, decision trees, and random forest. While all machine learning models were accurate in recognizing FT categories, logistic regression achieved the best performance across all metrics (accuracy: 0.93 ± 0.08, recall: 0.89 ± 0.16, precision: 0.93 ± 0.08, F1-score: 0.90 ± 0.11, AUC: 0.95 ± 0.07) at the window size of 5 s.

However, besides above pathogenic mechanisms, the role of alveolar edema in the disease progression has not been discussed comprehensively. Since the exudation of pulmonary edema fluid was extremely serious in COVID-19 patients, we bring out a hypothesis that severity of alveolar edema may determine the size of poorly-ventilated area and the blood oxygen content. Treatments to pulmonary edema (conservative fluid management, exogenous surfactant replacements and ethanol–oxygen vapor therapy hypothetically) may be greatly helpful for reducing the occurrences of severe cases. Given that late mechanical ventilation may cause mucus (edema fluid) to be blown deep into the small airways, oxygen therapy should be given at the early stages. The optimal time and blood oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) threshold for oxygen therapy are also discussed.","Yuan, Shu; Jiang, Si-Cong; Zhang, Zhong-Wei; Fu, Yu-Fan; Hu, Jing; Li, Zi-Lin",Cells,353,16

The electrostatic interaction is the dominant factor in the binding process of ligands to wMUS81. The residues Trp55, Arg59, Leu62, His63 and Arg69 were found to frequently form non-bonded contacts and hydrogen bonds to inhibitors. Moreover, the influence of the ligand D197, which formed the lowest binding free energy to wMUS81, on the structural change of enzyme was investigated using replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations. The obtained results indicated that D197, which forms a strong binding affinity, can modify the structure of wMUS81.

This study examined equity and social inclusion of urban development policies in Nigeria through the lenses of access to health and food/nutrition resources. METHOD: Desk review of 22 policy documents, strategies, and plans within the ambit of urban development was done. Documents were sourced from organizational websites and offices. Data were extracted by six independent reviewers using a uniform template designed to capture considerations of access to healthcare and food/nutrition resources within urban development policies/plans/strategies in Nigeria. Emerging themes on equity and social inclusion in access to health and food/nutirition resources were identified and analysed. RESULTS: Access to health and food/nutrition resources were explicit in eight (8) and twelve (12) policies/plans, respectively. Themes that reflect potential policy contributions to social inclusion and equitable access to health resources were: Provision of functional and improved health infrastructure; Primary Health Care strengthening for quality health service delivery; Provision of safety nets and social health insurance; Community participation and integration; and Public education and enlightenment. With respect to nutrition resources, emergent themes were: Provision of accessible and affordable land to farmers; Upscaling local food production, diversification and processing; Provision of safety nets; Private-sector participation; and Special considerations for vulnerable groups.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. From electronic national registry data, we used Cox analysis and bootstrapping to evaluate associations between baseline levels of biomarkers and standardised absolute risks of death/ICU admission, adjusted for age and gender. SETTING: All hospitals in Denmark. PARTICIPANTS: 1310 patients aged ≥18 years admitted to hospital with COVID-19 from 27th of February to 1st of May 2020, with available biochemistry data. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A composite of death/ICU admission occurring within 30 days. RESULTS: Of the 1310 patients admitted to hospital (54.6% men; median age 73.6 years), 352 (26.9%) experienced the composite endpoint and 263 (20.1%) died. For the composite endpoint, the absolute risks for moderately and severely elevated C reactive protein (CRP) were significantly higher, 21.5% and 39.2%, respectively, compared with 5.0% for those with normal CRP. Moderately and severely elevated leucocytes were significantly higher, 34.5% and 46.6% risk, respectively, compared with 23.2% for those with normal leucocytes. Moderately and severely decreased estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR) were significantly higher, 41.5% and 45.9% risk, respectively, compared with 30.4% for those with normal/mildly decreased eGFR. Normal and elevated ureas were significantly higher, 22.3% and 40.6% risk, respectively, compared with 7.3% for those with low urea. Elevated D-dimer was significantly higher, 31.8% risk, compared with 17.5% for those with normal D-dimer. Moderately and severely elevated troponins were significantly higher, 27.7% and 57.3% risk, respectively, compared with 9.4% for those with normal troponin. Elevated procalcitonin was significantly higher, 52.1% risk, compared with 28.0% for those with normal procalcitonin. CONCLUSION: In this nationwide study of patients admitted with COVID-19, elevated levels of CRP, leucocytes, procalcitonin, urea, troponins and D-dimer, and low levels of eGFR were associated with higher standardised absolute risk of death/ICU admission within 30 days.","Hodges, Gethin; Pallisgaard, Jannik; Schjerning Olsen, Anne-Marie; McGettigan, Patricia; Andersen, Mikkel; Krogager, Maria; Kragholm, Kristian; Køber, Lars; Gislason, Gunnar Hilmar; Torp-Pedersen, Christian; Bang, Casper N",BMJ Open,353,11

METHODS: During August 2009–July 2011, prospective population-based surveillance was conducted for hospitalizations of children aged <5 years in a rural community in Haryana State. Clinical data and respiratory specimens were collected. Swabs were tested by RT-PCR for influenza and parainfluenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus, coronaviruses, and adenovirus. Average annual hospitalization incidence was calculated using census data and adjusted for hospitalizations reported to occur at non-study hospitals according to a comunity healthcare utilization survey. RESULTS: Of 245 hospitalized children, respiratory viruses were detected among 98 (40%), of whom 92 (94%) had fever or respiratory symptoms. RSV accounted for the highest virus-associated hospitalization incidence (34.6/10,000, 95% CI 26.3–44.7) and 20% of hospitalizations. There were 11.8/10,000 (95% CI 7.9–18.4) influenza-associated hospitalizations (7% of hospitalizations). RSV and influenza virus detection peaked in winter (November–February) and rainy seasons (July), respectively. CONCLUSION: Respiratory viruses were associated with a substantial proportion of hospitalizations among young children in a rural Indian community. Public health research and prevention in India should consider targeting RSV and influenza in young children.","Broor, Shobha; Dawood, Fatimah S.; Pandey, Bharti G.; Saha, Siddhartha; Gupta, Vivek; Krishnan, Anand; Rai, Sanjay; Singh, Pratibha; Erdman, Dean; Lal, Renu B.",J Infect,353,18

There is a dearth of studies exploring the identifiable factors accounting for it. We aimed to identify the factors responsible for panic buying extracted from online media reports. Methods: We scrutinized the media reports published in English discussing the different aspects of panic buying. We collected data until May 30, 2020, and searched the possible mentioned reasons responsible for panic buying. Results: We analyzed a total of 784 media reports. The majority of the reports were found in Bing (18%), Ecosia (12.6%), Google (26.4%), and Yahoo (12.5%). Panic buying was reported in 93 countries. Among the 784 responses, a total of 171 reports did not explain the responsible factors of panic buying. Therefore, we analyzed the remaining 613 reports to identify the same. A sense of scarcity was reportedly found as the important factor in about 75% of the reports followed by increased demand (66.07%), the importance of the product (45.02%), anticipation of price hike (23.33%), and due to COVID-19 and its related factors (13.21%). Other reported factors were a rumor, psychological factors (safety-seeking behavior, uncertainty, anxiety reduction, and taking control), social learning, lack of trust, government action, and past experience. Conclusions: The study revealed the responsible factors of panic buying extracted from media reports. Further, studies involving the individuals indulging in panic buying behavior are warranted to replicate the findings.","Arafat, S. M.

Thus, monitoring programs for shellfish quality along the entire food chain could help to finally preserve the health of consumers. The aim of the present study was to provide up-to-date data on the prevalence of enteric virus contamination along the shellfish production and distribution chain in Sicily. To this end, 162 batches of mollusks were collected between 2017 and 2019 from harvesting areas, depuration and dispatch centers (n = 63), restaurants (n = 6) and retail stores (n = 93) distributed all over the island. Samples were processed according to ISO 15216 standard method, and the presence of genogroup GI and GII norovirus (NoV), hepatitis A and E viruses (HAV, HEV), rotavirus and adenovirus was investigated by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (real-time-RT PCR), nested (RT)-PCR and molecular genotyping. Our findings show that 5.56% of samples were contaminated with at least one NoV, HAV and/or HEV. Contaminated shellfish were sampled at production sites and retail stores and their origin was traced back to Spain and several municipalities in Italy. In conclusion, our study highlights the need to implement routine monitoring programs along the whole food chain as an effective measure to prevent foodborne transmission of enteric viruses.","Macaluso, Giusi; Guercio, Annalisa; Gucciardi, Francesca; Di Bella, Santina; La Rosa, Giuseppina; Suffredini, Elisabetta; Randazzo, Walter; Purpari, Giuseppa",Foods,353,11

Conventional methods to detect antigen-reactive T cells require in vitro antigenic re-stimulation or highly individualized peptide-human leukocyte antigen (pHLA) multimers. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to identify and profile SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells from Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. To do so, we induced transcriptional shifts by antigenic stimulation in vitro and took advantage of natural T cell receptor (TCR) sequences of clonally expanded T cells as barcodes for 'reverse phenotyping'. This allowed identification of SARS-CoV-2-reactive TCRs and revealed phenotypic effects introduced by antigen-specific stimulation. We characterized transcriptional signatures of currently and previously activated SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells, and showed correspondence with phenotypes of T cells from the respiratory tract of patients with severe disease in the presence or absence of virus in independent cohorts. Reverse phenotyping is a powerful tool to provide an integrated insight into cellular states of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells across tissues and activation states.","Fischer, D. S.; Ansari, M.

The genetic basis of human cancers was uncovered through the cloning of the tumor suppressor Rb gene. It encodes a nuclear DNA-binding protein whose self-interaction is regulated by cyclin-dependent kinases. A 3D-structure of Rb dimer is shown, confirming its multimeric status. Rb assumes a central role in cell cycle regulation and the “Rb pathway” is universally inactivated in human cancers. Hyperploidy refers to a state in which cells contain one or more extra chromosomes. Hyperploid progression occurs due to continued cell-cycling without cytokinesis in G1 checkpoint-defective cancer cells. The evidence for the triggering of hyperploid progression-mediated death in RB-mutant human retinoblastoma cells is shown. Hence, the very genetic mutation that predisposes to cancer can be exploited to induce lethality. The discovery helped to establish the principle of targeted cytotoxic cancer therapy at the mechanistic level. By triggering the lytic path, targeted therapy with tumor specificity at the genetic level can be developed. It sets the stage for systematically eliminating side effects for cytotoxic cancer therapy.","Hong, Frank-Un; Castro, Miguel; Linse, Klaus",World J Clin Oncol,353,15

This staggered implementation combined with the heterogeneity of the U.S. complicates quantification the effect of NPIs on the reproductive rate of SARS-CoV-2. We describe a data-driven approach to quantify the effect of NPIs that relies on county-level similarities to specialize a Bayesian hierarchical inference model based on observed fatalities. Using this approach, we estimate change in reproductive rate, Rt, due to implementation of NPIs in 1,417 U.S. counties. We estimate that as of May 28th, 2020 1,177 out of the considered 1,417 U.S. counties have reduced the reproductive rate of SARS-CoV-2 to below 1.0. The estimated effect of any individual NPI, however, is different across counties. Stay-at-home orders were estimated as the only effective NPI in metropolitan and urban counties, while advisory NPIs were estimated to be effective in more rural counties. The expected level of infection predicted by the model ranges from 0 to 28.7% and is far from herd immunity even in counties with advanced spread. Our results suggest that county characteristics are pertinent to re-opening decisions.","Wu, J. Y.; Killeen, B. D.; Nikutta, P.; Thies, M.; Zapaishchykova, A.; Chakraborty, S.; Unberath, M.",,353,26

We need an objective assessment to differentiate between organic gastrointestinal diseases and functional bowel symptoms. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of fecal calprotectin (FC) in predicting organic gastrointestinal diseases. METHODS: In a prospective observational study, consecutive patients referred for colonoscopy to the Department of Medicine and Geriatrics at the Kwong Wah Hospital in Hong Kong were recruited. Stool samples were collected within 24 h before colonoscopy. FC was measured by a commercial kit. Upper endoscopy investigations were then proceeded if normal colonoscopy but elevated FC. RESULTS: Two hundred and seventy out of 429 patients had FC above 50 μg/g. Eighty‐six out of 270 with elevated FC had significant colonoscopy pathological findings. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of FC test for diagnosing a significant organic colonoscopy or upper endoscopy disease were 91.7, 55.6, 57.0, and 91.2%, respectively. The NPV of FC for colorectal cancer, high risk polyp, and colon inflammation were 98.7, 96.2, and 98.1%, respectively. The NPV of FC in the condition of altered bowel habit or abdominal pain in predicting colorectal cancer and inflammation were 93.8 and 100%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: FC is a reliable marker of ruling out organic bowel diseases. A single negative FC test could be used as a triage tool to prioritize the need and urgency of further investigation, particularly in the setting of altered bowel habits and abdominal pain.","Kan, Yee Man; Chu, Sin Yan; Loo, Ching Kong",JGH Open,353,32

This study presents an analysis of the excess mortality across the 107 Italian provinces, stratified by sex, age group, and period of the outbreak. Methods: The analysis was performed using a two-stage interrupted time series design using daily mortality data for the period January 2015 - May 2020. In the first stage, we performed province-level quasi-Poisson regression models, with smooth functions to define a baseline risk while accounting for trends and weather conditions and to flexibly estimate the variation in excess risk during the outbreak. Estimates were pooled in the second stage using a mixed-effects multivariate meta-analysis. Results: In the period 15 February - 15 May 2020, we estimated an excess of 47,490 (95% empirical confidence intervals: 43,984 to 50,362) deaths in Italy, corresponding to an increase of 29.5% (95%eCI: 26.8 to 31.9%) from the expected mortality. The analysis indicates a strong geographical pattern, with the majority of excess deaths occurring in northern regions, where few provinces experienced up to 800% increase during the peak in late March. There were differences by sex, age, and area both in the overall impact and in its temporal distribution. Conclusions: This study offers a detailed picture of excess mortality during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. The strong geographical and temporal patterns can be related to implementation of lockdown policies and multiple direct and indirect pathways in mortality risk.","Scortichini, Matteo; Santos, Rochelle Schneider dos; De039, Francesca; Donato,; Sario, Manuela De; Michelozzi, Paola; Davoli, Marina; Masselot, Pierre; Sera, Francesco; Gasparrini, Antonio",,353,24

There has been robust growth in the use of telemedicine since the pandemic began, rendering safety in care provided by minimizing exposure to patients and healthcare workers. There has been tremendous growth and innovation in various digital applications that facilitate telehealth as the platforms continue to improve. Even in the absence of a pandemic, telemedicine allows for care of patients who may live in remote areas or have issues with transportation and comorbidities prohibiting ambulation.

Here we report on a medical student telephone initiative set-up by a final year GP trainee (the equivalent of a family medicine resident), which aimed to support patients at high risk and vulnerable to the Coronavirus Disease of 2019 [Covid-19]. In addition, it was hoped the project would mitigate a digital divide, enable proactive anticipatory planning, and provide an active learning environment to compensate for the pandemic’s impact on medical education. METHODS: Thirty-three medical students conducted daily telephone conversations with high risk and vulnerable patients as specified by the initial NHSE published lists. They confirmed public health messages, offered details for voluntary support groups, established need for medication delivery, explored levels of digital connectivity, and prompted discussions around end-of-life choices. Students had access to online reflective resources and daily remote debriefing sessions with the GP trainee. A convergent mixed-methods evaluation was subsequently undertaken, using quantitative process and descriptive data and individual qualitative interviews were conducted according to a maximal variation sampling strategy with students, General Practitioners [GPs], and the GP trainee. Inductive thematic analysis was then applied with cross-validation, respondent validation, and rich evidential illustration aiding integrity. RESULTS: Ninety-seven ‘high risk’ and 781 ‘vulnerable’ calls were made. Individuals were generally aware of public heath information, but some struggled to interpret and apply it within their own lives. Therefore respondents felt students provided additional practical and psychological benefits, particularly with regard to strengthening the links with the community voluntary groups. The project was widely liked by students who reported high levels of skill development and widened awareness, particularly valuing the active learning environment and reflective feedback sessions. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates utilization of medical students as wider assets within the primary health care team, with an initiative that enables support for vulnerable patients whilst promoting active medical education. Ongoing integration of students within ‘normal’ primary health care roles, such as chronic disease or mental health reviews, could provide similar opportunities for supported active and reflective learning.

This method was used to evaluate the complete memory effects within the model. The Caputo–Fabrizio (CF) and Atangana–Baleanu models were used predicatively, to demonstrate the possible long–term trajectories of COVID-19. Thus, the expression of the basic reproduction number using the next generating matrix was derived. We also investigated the local stability of the equilibrium points. Additionally, we examined the existence and uniqueness of the solution for both extensions of these models. Comparisons of these two epidemic modeling approaches (i.e. CF and ABC fractional derivative) illustrated that, for non-integer [Formula: see text] value. The ABC approach had a significant effect on the dynamics of the epidemic and provided new perspective for its utilization as a tool to advance research in disease transmission dynamics for critical COVID-19 cases. Concurrently, the CF approach demonstrated promise for use in mild cases.

The discovery of microRNA (miRNAs) as a new class of gene regulators has greatly expanded our understanding of the controlling module of cardiac Ca(2+) cycling. Furthermore, many studies have explored the involvement of miRNAs in heart diseases. In this review, we aim to summarize cardiac Ca(2+) signaling and Ca(2+)-related miRNAs in pathological conditions, including cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure, myocardial infarction, and atrial fibrillation.

We report a new methodology, the Patient Information Based Algorithm (PIBA), for estimating the death rate of a disease in real-time using publicly available data collected during an outbreak. PIBA estimated the death rate based on data of the patients in Wuhan and then in other cities throughout China. The estimated days from hospital admission to death was 13 (standard deviation (SD), 6 days). The death rates based on PIBA were used to predict the daily numbers of deaths since the week of February 25, 2020, in China overall, Hubei province, Wuhan city, and the rest of the country except Hubei province. The death rate of COVID-19 ranges from 0.75% to 3% and may decrease in the future. The results showed that the real death numbers had fallen into the predicted ranges. In addition, using the preliminary data from China, the PIBA method was successfully used to estimate the death rate and predict the death numbers of the Korean population. In conclusion, PIBA can be used to efficiently estimate the death rate of a new infectious disease in real-time and to predict future deaths. The spread of 2019-nCoV and its case fatality rate may vary in regions with different climates and temperatures from Hubei and Wuhan. PIBA model can be built based on known information of early patients in different countries.","Wang, Lishi; Li, Jing; Guo, Sumin; Xie, Ning; Yao, Lan; Cao, Yanhong; Day, Sara W.; Howard, Scott C.; Graff, J.

Despite the fact that cell-based SPR assays are label-free and thus provide all the associated benefits, they have never been used to study viral growth kinetics and to predict drug antiviral response in cells. In this study, we prove the concept that the cell-based SPR assay can be applied in the kinetic analysis of the early stages of viral infection of cells and the antiviral drug activity in the infected cells. For this purpose, cells immobilized on the SPR slides were infected with human coronavirus HCov-229E and treated with hydroxychloroquine. The SPR response was measured at different time intervals within the early stages of infection. Methyl Thiazolyl Tetrazolium (MTT) assay was used to provide the reference data. We found that the results of the SPR and MTT assays were consistent, and SPR is a reliable tool in investigating virus–host cell interaction and the mechanism of action of viral inhibitors. SPR assay was more sensitive and accurate in the first hours of infection within the first replication cycle, whereas the MTT assay was not so effective. After the second replication cycle, noise was generated by the destruction of the cell layer and by the remnants of dead cells, and masks useful SPR signals.","Genova-Kalou, Petia; Dyankov, Georgi; Marinov, Radoslav; Mankov, Vihar; Belina, Evdokiya; Kisov, Hristo; Strijkova-Kenderova, Velichka; Kantardjiev, Todor",Biosensors (Basel),353,4

More than two hundred countries around the world have already been affected by this severe virus as it spreads by human interaction. Moreover, the symptoms of novel coronavirus are quite similar to the general seasonal flu. Screening of infected patients is considered as a critical step in the fight against COVID-19. As there are no distinctive COVID-19 positive case detection tools available, the need for supporting diagnostic tools has increased. Therefore, it is highly relevant to recognize positive cases as early as possible to avoid further spreading of this epidemic. However, there are several methods to detect COVID-19 positive patients, which are typically performed based on respiratory samples and among them, a critical approach for treatment is radiologic imaging or X-Ray imaging. Recent findings from X-Ray imaging techniques suggest that such images contain relevant information about the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Application of Deep Neural Network (DNN) techniques coupled with radiological imaging can be helpful in the accurate identification of this disease, and can also be supportive in overcoming the issue of a shortage of trained physicians in remote communities. In this article, we have introduced a VGG-16 (Visual Geometry Group, also called OxfordNet) Network-based Faster Regions with Convolutional Neural Networks (Faster R-CNN) framework to detect COVID-19 patients from chest X-Ray images using an available open-source dataset. Our proposed approach provides a classification accuracy of 97.36%, 97.65% of sensitivity, and a precision of 99.28%. Therefore, we believe this proposed method might be of assistance for health professionals to validate their initial assessment towards COVID-19 patients.","Shibly, Kabid Hassan; Dey, Samrat Kumar; Tahzib-Ul-Islam, Md.; Rahman, Md.

To this aim, first, PSF anti-inflammatory properties were tested on young and senescent LPS-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). As a result, PSF treatment increased miR-146a and decreased IRAK-1 and IL-6 expression levels. In addition, the PSF antioxidant effect was validated in vitro with DPPH assay and confirmed by in vivo treatments in C. elegans. Our findings showed beneficial effects on worms’ lifespan and healthspan with positive outcomes on longevity markers (i.e., miR-124 upregulation and miR-39 downregulation) as well. The PSF effect on wound healing was tested using the same cells and experimental conditions employed to investigate PSF antioxidant and anti-inflammaging ability. PSF treatment resulted in a significant improvement of wound healing closure (ca. 70%), through cell migration, both in young and older cells, associated to a downregulation of inflammation markers. In conclusion, PSF extract antioxidant and anti-inflammaging abilities result in improved wound healing capacity, thus suggesting that PSF might be helpful to improve the quality of life for its beneficial health effects.","Coppari, Sofia; Colomba, Mariastella; Fraternale, Daniele; Brinkmann, Vanessa; Romeo, Margherita; Rocchi, Marco Bruno Luigi; Di Giacomo, Barbara; Mari, Michele; Guidi, Loretta; Ramakrishna, Seeram; Ventura, Natascia; Albertini, Maria Cristina",Antioxidants (Basel),353,16

To shed light on how the Philippines initially managed the disease, our paper analyzed the early phase of the government's pandemic response. Using machine learning, we compiled the official press releases issued by the Department of Health from early January to mid-April 2020 where a total of 283,560 datasets amounting to 2.5 megabytes (Mb) were analyzed using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm. Our results revealed five latent themes: the highest effort (40%) centered on “Nationwide Reporting of COVID-19 Status”, while “Contact Tracing of Suspected and Infected Individuals” had the least focus at only 11.68%- indicating a lack of priority in this area. Our findings suggest that while the government was ill-prepared in the early phase of the pandemic, it exerted efforts in rearranging its fiscal and operational priorities toward the management of the disease. However, we emphasize that this article should be read and understood with caution. More than a year has already passed since the outbreak in the country and many (in)actions and challenges have adversely impacted its response. These include the Duterte administration's securitization and militarization of pandemic response and its apparent failure to find a balance between the lives and livelihoods of Filipinos, to name a few.

METHODS: Between February 1, 2020, and December 31, 2020, patients with COVID-19 infection and surgically treated PFF were included. Patients’ demographic characteristics, oxygen (O2) therapy, comorbidities, and AO type fracture were collected. Chi-square test or Fisher test and hazard ratio were used to assessing the correlation between mortality rate, patient characteristics, and COVID-19 status. Kaplan-Meyer curve was used to analyze 30–60–90-day mortality. Level of significance was set as p < 0.05. RESULTS: Fifty-six patients (mean age of 82.7 ± 8.85 years) were included. Thirty-day mortality rate was 5%, which increased to 21% at 60 days and 90 days. Eleven patients died, eight due to AO type A-like and three due to AO type B-like fractures. No significant difference in mortality rate between patients with cardiopulmonary comorbidity or no cardiopulmonary comorbidity was found (p = 0.67); a significant difference in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or history of pulmonary embolism (PE) and patients without COPD was found (p = 0.0021).

Phylogenetic studies show that host shifts are a frequent event in the evolution of most pathogens, but why pathogens successfully jump between some host species but not others is only just becoming clear. The susceptibility of potential new hosts can vary enormously, with close relatives of the natural host typically being the most susceptible. Often, pathogens must adapt to successfully infect a novel host, for example by evolving to use different cell surface receptors, to escape the immune response, or to ensure they are transmitted by the new host. In viruses there are often limited molecular solutions to achieve this, and the same sequence changes are often seen each time a virus infects a particular host. These changes may come at a cost to other aspects of the pathogen's fitness, and this may sometimes prevent host shifts from occurring. Here we examine how these evolutionary factors affect patterns of host shifts and disease emergence.","Longdon, Ben; Brockhurst, Michael A.; Russell, Colin A.; Welch, John J.; Jiggins, Francis M.",PLoS Pathog,353,1

In this study we demonstrate that the Q939↓S940 peptide bond, located between the polymerase and Zn-finger regions of pp1ab (the POL↓Zn site), is processed by the 3CLpro, albeit inefficiently. Mutagenesis of the POL↓Zn site, as well as the previously identified HD1↓3C site in the 1a region of pp1a and pp1ab, demonstrated that the amino acid residues at the P2 and P1 positions of the cleavage site, occupied by L and Q, respectively, were important determinants of 3CLpro substrate specificity. Finally, a direct comparison of the 3CLpro-mediated cleavages at the HD1↓3C and POL↓Zn sites was made by determining the rate constants using synthetic peptides. The results show that while a larger polypeptide substrate carrying the HD1↓3C site was processed more efficiently than a polypeptide substrate carrying the POL↓Zn site, cleavage of the synthetic peptide substrates containing these two cleavage sites occurred at similar efficiencies. This indicates that the overall conformation of a large polyprotein substrate is important in the accessibility of the cleavage site to the proteinase.","Piñón, Josefina D.; Teng, Henry; Weiss, Susan R.",Virology,353,1

The total lipids of microalga Chlorococcum sp., isolated from the Irish coast, were fractionated into neutral-, glyco-, and phospho-lipids, and were tested in vitro for their anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic activities. All tested lipid fractions showed strong anti-platelet-activating factor (PAF) and antithrombin activities in human platelets (half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) values ranging ~25–200 μg of lipid) with the highest activities in glyco- and phospho-lipid fractions.

Emerging infections, increase of antimicrobial resistance, deliberately released threats and ongoing battles with common illnesses were amplified by the spread of disease through increased international travel. The Internet has dramatically changed the availability of information about outbreaks; however, little research has been done in comparing the online behavior of public and professionals around the same events and the effect of media coverage of outbreaks on information needs. OBJECTIVE: To investigate professional and public online information needs around major infection outbreaks and correlate these with media coverage. Questions include (1) How do health care professionals’ online needs for public health and infection control information differ from those of the public?, (2) Does dramatic media coverage of outbreaks contribute to the information needs among the public?, and (3) How do incidents of diseases and major policy events relate to the information needs of professionals? METHODS: We used three longitudinal time-based datasets from mid-2006 until end of 2010: (1) a unique record of professional online behavior on UK infection portals: National electronic Library of Infection and National Resource of Infection Control (NeLI/NRIC), (2) equivalent public online information needs (Google Trends), and (3) relevant media coverage (LexisNexis). Analysis of NeLI/NRIC logs identified the highest interest around six major infectious diseases: Clostridium difficile (C difficile)/Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), tuberculosis, meningitis, norovirus, and influenza. After pre-processing, the datasets were analyzed and triangulated with each other. RESULTS: Public information needs were more static, following the actual disease occurrence less than those of professionals, whose needs increase with public health events (eg, MRSA/C difficile) and the release of major national policies or important documents. Media coverage of events resulted in major public interest (eg, the 2007/2008 UK outbreak of C difficile/MRSA). An exception was norovirus, showing a seasonal pattern for both public and professionals, which matched the periodic disease occurrence. Meningitis was a clear example of a disease with heightened media coverage tending to focus on individual and celebrity cases. Influenza was a major concern during the 2009 H1N1 outbreak creating massive public interest in line with the spring and autumn peaks in cases; although in autumn 2009, there was no corresponding increase in media coverage. Online resources play an increasing role in fulfilling professionals’ and public information needs. CONCLUSIONS: Significant factors related to a surge of professional interest around a disease were typically key publications and major policy changes. Public interests seem more static and correlate with media influence but to a lesser extent than expected.

These PODs were often located on large parking lot sites with high heat severity and did not take heat mitigation or management strategies into account for unacclimated workers and volunteers. To investigate the personal heat exposure of workers, volunteers, and clients at three PODs in Tucson, Arizona, we collected ambient air temperatures, wet bulb globe temperatures (WBGT), surface temperatures, and thermal images. We also made qualitative observations and compared data against daily meteorological records. Ambient air temperatures at all three PODs exceeded the meteorological recorded high. WBGT on average were 8°F (4.4°C) higher in full sun locations than shaded locations such as tents. Evaporative cooling decreased ambient air temperatures by 2°F (1.2°C) when placed one per tent, but decreased ambient air temperatures by 7°F (3.9°C) when placed en masse in a larger tent. Vehicle surface temperatures exceeded recommended safe limits of 140°F (60°C) at all three sites, with a maximum temperature recorded at 170.9°F (77.2°C). Public health professionals should consider heat resilience, including heat mitigation and management measures, in POD and PHEP response operations to reduce exposure. This includes considering the UHI effect in the siting of PODs, applying heat mitigation strategies in the design of PODs such as the adaptive use of solar panels for shading, and improving heat safety guidance for workers and volunteers.","Keith, Ladd; Iroz-Elardo, Nicole; Austof, Erika; Sami, Ida; Arora, Mona",J Clim Chang Health,353,24

Telemedicine can effectively transfer real-time ultrasound images via video-conferencing. We report the successful introduction of a fetal ultrasound telemedicine service linking a specialist fetal medicine (FM) centre and a remote obstetric unit. METHODS: Over a four-year period from October 2015, all women referred for FM consultation from the obstetric unit were seen via telemedicine, excluding cases where invasive testing, intrauterine therapy or cardiac anomalies were anticipated. The outcomes measured included the indication for FM referral; scan duration and image and sound quality during the consultation. Women’s perceptions of the telemedicine consultation and estimated costs to attend the FM centre were measured by a structured questionnaire completed following the first telemedicine appointment during the Phase 1 of the project. RESULTS: Overall, 297 women had a telemedicine consultation during Phase 1 (pilot and evaluation) and Phase 2 (embedding and adoption) of the project, which covered a 4 year period 34 women completed questionnaires during the Phase 1 of the study. Travel to the telemedicine consultation took a median (range) time of 20 min (4150), in comparison to an estimated journey of 230 min (120,450) to the FM centre. On average, women would have spent approximately £28 to travel to the FM centre per visit. The overall costs for the woman and her partner/ friend to attend the FM centre was estimated to be £439. Women were generally satisfied with the service and valued the opportunity to have a FM consultation locally. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that a fetal ultrasound telemedicine service can be successfully introduced to provide FM ultrasound of sufficient quality to allow fetal diagnosis and specialist consultation with parents. Furthermore, the service is acceptable to parents, has shown a reduction in family costs and journey times.

However, direct clinical evidence linking increased inspiratory effort to lung injury is scarce. We adapted a recently developed computational simulator that replicates distinctive features of COVID-19 pathophysiology to quantify the mechanical forces that could lead to P-SILI at different levels of respiratory effort. In accordance with recent data, the simulator was calibrated to represent a spontaneously breathing COVID-19 patient with severe hypoxaemia (SaO2 80.6%) and relatively well-preserved lung mechanics (lung compliance of 47.5 ml/cmH2O), being treated with supplemental oxygen (FiO2 = 100%). Simulations were conducted at tidal volumes (VT) and respiratory rates (RR) of 7 ml/kg and 14 breaths/min (representing normal respiratory effort) and at VT/RR of 15/14, 7/20, 15/20, 10/30, 12/30, 10/35, 12/35, 10/40, 12/40 ml/kg / breaths/min. Lung compliance was unaffected by increased VT but decreased significantly at higher RR. While oxygenation improved, significant increases in multiple indicators of the potential for lung injury were observed at all higher VT/RR combinations tested. Pleural pressure swing increased from 10.1 cmH2O at baseline to 30 cmH2O at VT/RR of 15 ml/kg / 20 breaths/min and to 54.6 cmH2O at 12 ml/kg / 40 breaths/min. Dynamic strain increased from 0.3 to 0.49 at VT/RR of 12 ml/kg / 30 breaths/min, and to 0.6 at 15 ml/kg / 20 breaths/min. Mechanical power increased from 7.83 J/min to 17.7 J/min at VT/RR of 7 ml/kg / 20 breaths/min, and to 240.5 7 J/min at 12 ml/kg / 40 breaths/min. Our results suggest that the forces generated during increased inspiratory effort in severe COVID-19 are compatible with the development of P-SILI. If conventional oxygen therapy or non-invasive ventilation is ineffective in reducing respiratory effort, control of driving and transpulmonary pressures with invasive ventilation may reduce the risk of P-SILI and allow time for the resolution of the underlying condition.","Das, A.; Weaver, L.; Saffaran, S.; Yehya, N.; Scott, T.

Variola is transmitted by respiratory droplets and MVA immunization by skin scarification (s.s.) protected mice far more effectively against lethal respiratory challenge with vaccinia virus (VACV) than any other route of delivery, and at lower doses. Comparisons of s.s. with intradermal, subcutaneous, or intramuscular routes showed that MVA(OVA) s.s.-generated T cells were both more abundant and transcriptionally unique. MVA(OVA) s.s. produced greater numbers of lung Ova-specific CD8(+) T(RM) and was superior in protecting mice against lethal VACV(OVA) respiratory challenge. Nearly as many lung T(RM) were generated with MVA(OVA) s.s. immunization compared to intra-tracheal immunization with MVA(OVA) and both routes vaccination protected mice against lethal pulmonary challenge with VACV(OVA). Strikingly, MVA(OVA) s.s.-generated effector T cells exhibited overlapping gene transcriptional profiles to those generated via intra-tracheal immunization. Overall, our data suggest that heterologous MVA vectors immunized via s.s. are uniquely well-suited as vaccine vectors for respiratory pathogens, which may be relevant to COVID-19.

It is important to note that evolution has shaped the burden of disease in the modern world in which we practice and educate for public health. Human cultures and technologies have modified life on Planet Earth and have co-evolved with myriad other species, including microorganisms, plant and animal sources of food, invertebrate vectors of disease, and intermediate bird, mammal, and primate hosts. Molecular mechanisms of evolution have produced differential resistance or susceptibility to infectious agents, including malaria, plague, smallpox, TB, measles, and diarrheal and respiratory diseases. The domestication of sheep and cattle led to natural selection in favor of human populations able to digest milk throughout life through persistence into adulthood of lactase enzyme expression in the intestine, a major story of anthropology. The emergence of a “Western diet” of dairy, refined cereal grains, refined sugars, vegetable oils, alcoholic beverages, salt, and omega-6-rich meats has dramatically altered glycemic load, fatty acid composition, macro-nutrients, acid-base balance, sodium/potassium ratio, and fiber content. This is a major story of nutrition and disease. The results include epidemics of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, osteoporosis, certain cancers, and bowel, inflammatory, and autoimmune disorders. Another interesting phenomenon is the selection of excessive hemostatic activity from platelets and the plasma clotting proteins; what was protective against death from bleeding after injuries among hunter-gatherers or from pregnancy-related hemorrhage now contributes to thrombosis underlying heart attacks and strokes. Conversely, there is little pressure against hemostasis and thrombosis since deaths from these causes occur mostly after the reproductive years of life. Learning about evolution over millennia for humans and over hours or days for microbes enlivens the experience of understanding evolutionary biology in public health context.","Omenn, Gilbert S.",Evolution: Education and Outreach,353,26

Initial sex-disaggregated mortality data emerging from the Wuhan province of China identified male sex as a risk factor for increased COVID-19 mortality. In this systematic review, we aimed to assess the role of sex in the risk of mortality from COVID-19 in adult patients through comparison of clinical markers and inflammatory indexes. A systematic search was conducted on the following databases: PubMed, WHO COVID-19 database, Ovid MEDLINE, and Web of Science between the dates of June 15, 2020, and June 30, 2020. Key search terms used included: “sex”, “gender”, “SARS-COV-2”, “COVID” and “mortality”. We accepted the following types of studies concerning adult COVID-19 patients: retrospective cohort, observational cohort, case series, and applied research. Further studies were extracted from reference searching. The risk of bias was determined using the National Institutes of Health Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort, Cross-Sectional Studies, and Case Series. We identified a total of 16 studies published between January 2020 and June 2020 for analysis in this systematic review. Our study population consisted of 11 cohort studies, four case series, and one genetic study, including a total of 76,555 participants. Ten of the studies included in this review observed a higher risk of mortality among males compared to females, and eight of these studies found this risk to be statistically significant. Sex-disaggregated COVID-19 mortality data identifies male patients with comorbidities as being at an increased risk of mortality worldwide. Further investigation revealed differences in immune response regulated by sex hormones, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression, and health behaviours as contributing factors to increased risk of mortality from COVID-19 among males. Nine out of the 16 studies included were conducted in China. In order to comprehensively assess sex-differences in the risk of mortality from COVID-19, more studies will need to be conducted worldwide. Sex-disaggregated COVID-19 data published in the medical literature is limited, however it has become evident that male sex is an important risk factor for mortality. Further exploration into the impact of sex on this pandemic is required in order to develop targeted therapies, as well as public health policies, and to prevent sex bias in treatment.","Kelada, Monica; Anto, Ailin; Dave, Karishma; Saleh, Sohag N",Cureus,353,26

The objective of this study was to explore the perceived impact of confinement in patients with Parkinson’s disease and document the effects of gender and living environment. METHODS: We recruited two cohorts from the Canadian provinces of Québec and Alberta, which differed in the dynamics of COVID-19 spreading at the time of the study, and administered a questionnaire on the perceived effects of confinement on daily living and disease management. RESULTS: The data reveals that approximately half of the patients experienced a change in one or more clinical symptoms, with differences observed between gender (e.g. day-to-day changes in slowness in men, aggravated headaches in women) and geographic location (e.g. increased depression in Alberta but reduced sleep quality in Québec). Furthermore, participants identifying as women or living in Alberta implemented more frequently home or online exercise. Lastly, high levels of satisfaction with phone or video consultations did not translate into a sustained interest to pursue this mode of healthcare. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that COVID-19-related confinement affected Parkinson’s disease manifestation and management.

However, the molecular mechanism underlying the transcriptional regulation of CGA biosynthesis remains unclear. Hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:quinate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (HQT2) is the last rate-limiting enzyme in chlorogenic acid biosynthesis in Taraxacum antungense. Therefore, using the TaHQT2 gene promoter as a probe, a yeast one-hybrid library was performed, and a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, TabHLH1, was identified that shared substantial homology with Gynura bicolor DC bHLH1. The TabHLH1 transcript was highly induced by salt stress, and the TabHLH1 protein was localized in the nucleus. CGA and luteolin concentrations in TabHLH1-overexpression transgenic lines were significantly higher than those in the wild type, while CGA and luteolin concentrations in TabHLH1-RNA interference (RNAi) transgenic lines were significantly lower. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that overexpression and RNAi of TabHLH1 in T. antungense significantly affected CGA and luteolin concentrations by upregulating or downregulating CGA and luteolin biosynthesis pathway genes, especially TaHQT2, 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (Ta4CL), chalcone isomerase (TaCHI), and flavonoid-3′-hydroxylase (TaF3′H). Dual-luciferase, yeast one-hybrid, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that TabHLH1 directly bound to the bHLH-binding motifs of proTaHQT2 and proTa4CL. This study suggests that TabHLH1 participates in the regulatory network of CGA and luteolin biosynthesis in T. antungense and might be useful for metabolic engineering to promote plant polyphenol biosynthesis.","Liu, Qun; Li, Li; Cheng, Haitao; Yao, Lixiang; Wu, Jie; Huang, Hui; Ning, Wei; Kai, Guoyin",Hortic Res,353,18

ACE2 exists as a membrane-bound protein on major viral target pulmonary epithelial cells, and its peptidase domain (PD) interacts SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with higher affinity. Therefore, targeting ACE2 is an important pharmacological intervention for a SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this review, we described the two-way switch role of ACE2 in the treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia and underlying comorbidities, and discussed the potential effect of the ACE inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker on a hypertension patient with the SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, we analyzed the S-protein-binding site on ACE2 and suggested that blocking hot spot-31 and hot spot-353 on ACE2 could be a therapeutic strategy for preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Besides, the recombinant ACE2 protein could be another potential treatment option for SARS-CoV-2 induced acute severe lung failure. This review could provide beneficial information for the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents via targeting ACE2 and the clinical usage of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) drugs for novel coronavirus pneumonia treatment.","Pang, Xiao Cong; Zhang, Han Xu; Zhang, Zhi; Rinkiko, Suguro; Cui, Yi Min; Zhu, Yi Zhun",Molecules,353,20

Here, we aimed to summarize the existing evidence on serial interval distributions and delays in case isolation for COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the published literature and preprints in PubMed on two epidemiological parameters namely serial intervals and delay intervals relating to isolation of cases for COVID-19 until 22 October, 2020 following predefined eligibility criteria. We assessed the variation in these parameter estimates by correlation and regression analysis. RESULTS: Of 103 unique studies identified on serial intervals of COVID-19, 56 were included providing 129 estimates and of 451 unique studies on isolation delays, 18 studies were included providing 74 estimates. Serial interval estimates varied from 1.0 to 9.9 days, while case isolation delays varied from 1.0 to 12.5 days which were associated with spatial, methodological and temporal factors. In mainland China, the pooled mean serial interval was 6.2 (range, 5.1-7.8) days before the epidemic peak and reduced to 4.9 (range, 1.9-6.5) days after the epidemic peak. Similarly, the pooled mean isolation delay related intervals were 6.0 (range, 2.9-12.5) days and 2.4 (range, 2.0-2.7) days before and after the epidemic peak, respectively. There was a positive association between serial interval and case isolation delay. CONCLUSIONS: Temporal factors, such as different control measures and case isolation in particular led to shorter serial interval estimates over time. Correcting transmissibility estimates for these time-varying distributions could aid mitigation efforts.","Ali, Sheikh Taslim; Yeung, Amy; Shan, Songwei; Wang, Lin; Gao, Huizhi; Du, Zhanwei; Xu, Xiao-Ke; Wu, Peng; Lau, Eric H Y; Cowling, Benjamin J",Clin Infect Dis,353,26

The collective impact of environmental and ecosystem factors, as well as biodiversity, on the spread of COVID-19 and its mortality evolution remain empirically unknown, particularly in regions with a wide ecosystem range. The aim of our study is to assess how those factors impact on the COVID-19 spread and mortality by country. This study compiled a global database merging WHO daily case reports (of 218 countries) with other publicly available measures from January 21st to May 18th, 2020. We applied spatio-temporal models to identify the influence of biodiversity, temperature, and precipitation and fitted generalized linear mixed models to identify the effects of environmental variables. Additionally, we used count time series to characterize the association between COVID-19 spread and air quality factors. All analyses are adjusted by social demographic, country-income level, and government policy intervention confounders, among 160 countries, globally. Our results reveal a statistically meaningful association between COVID-19 infection and several factors of interest at country and city levels such as the national biodiversity index, air quality, and pollutants elements (PM(10,) PM(2.5) and O(3)). Particularly, there is a significant relationship of loss of biodiversity, high level of air pollutants, and diminished air quality with COVID-19 infection spread and mortality. Our findings provide an empirical foundation for future studies on the relationship between air quality variables, a country’s biodiversity, and COVID-19 transmission and mortality. The significant relationships measured in this study can be valuable when governments plan environmental and health policies, as alternative strategy to respond to new COVID-19 outbreaks and prevent future crises.","Fernández, Daniel; Giné-Vázquez, Iago; Liu, Ivy; Yucel, Recai; Nai Ruscone, Marta; Morena, Marianthi; García, Víctor Gerardo; Haro, Josep Maria; Pan, William; Tyrovolas, Stefanos",Environ Pollut,353,24

We received a request from National Health Systems Resource Centre, a public agency in India, for a Rapid Evidence Synthesis (RES) on community health workers (CHWs) for COVID-19 prevention and control. Methods: We searched PubMed, websites of ministries, public agencies, multilateral institutions, COVID-19 resource aggregators and pre-prints (without language restrictions) for articles on the role, challenges and enablers for CHWs in pandemics. Two reviewers screened the records independently with a third reviewer resolving disagreements. One reviewer extracted data in a consensus data extraction form with another reviewer cross-checking it. A framework on CHW performance in primary healthcare not specific to pandemic was used to guide data extraction and narrative analysis. Results: We retrieved 211 records and finally included 36 articles on the role, challenges and enablers for CHWs in pandemics. We found that CHWs play an important role in building awareness, countering stigma and maintaining essential primary healthcare service delivery. It is essential that CHWs are provided adequate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and appropriately trained in its usage in the early stages of the pandemic. Wide range of policies and guidance is required to ensure health systems functioning. A clear guidance for prioritizing essential activities, postponing non-essential ones and additional pandemic related activities is crucial. CHWs experience stigmatization, isolation and social exclusion. Psychosocial support, non-performance-based incentives, additional transport allowance, accommodation, child-support, awards and recognition programs have been used in previous pandemics. We also created inventories of resources with guiding notes for quick utility by decision makers on guidelines for health workers (n=24), self-isolation in the community (n=10) and information, education and counselling materials on COVID-19 (n=16). Conclusions: CHWs play a critical role in pandemics like COVID-19. It is important to ensure role clarity, training, supportive supervision, as well as their work satisfaction, health and well-being. There is a need for more implementation research on CHWs in pandemics like COVID-19.","Bhaumik, S.; Moola, S.; Tyagi, J.; Nambiar, D.; Kakoti, M.",,353,1

Participants were randomly assigned into one of three groups: (a) predictive dashboard, (b) descriptive dashboard, or (c) control (i.e., no dashboard). Measures of motivation and statistical anxiety were collected in the beginning and the end of the semester via the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire and Statistical Anxiety Rating Scale. Individual semi-structured interviews were used to understand learners’ perceptions of the course and whether the use of the dashboards influenced the meaning of their learning experiences. Results indicate that, compared to the control group, the predictive dashboard significantly reduced learners’ interpretation anxiety and had an effect on intrinsic goal orientation that depended on learners’ lower or higher initial levels of intrinsic goal orientation. In comparison to the control group, both predictive and descriptive dashboards reduced worth of anxiety (negative attitudes towards statistics) for learners who started the course with higher levels of worth anxiety. Thematic analysis revealed that learners who adopted a more performance-avoidance goal orientation approach demonstrated higher levels of anxiety regardless of the dashboard used.

The peptides are pleiotropic effectors of innate immunity, possessing broad spectrum antimicrobial activities and immunoregulatory properties. Here we report that rhesus θ-defensin 1 (RTD-1) is highly effective in arresting and reversing joint disease in a rodent model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Parenteral RTD-1 treatment of DA/OlaHsd rats with established pristane-induced arthritis (PIA) rapidly suppressed joint disease progression, restored limb mobility, and preserved normal joint architecture. RTD-1 significantly reduced joint IL-1β levels compared with controls. RTD-1 dose-dependently inhibited fibroblast-like synoviocyte (FLS) invasiveness and FLS IL-6 production. Consistent with the inhibition of FLS invasiveness, RTD-1 was a potent inhibitor of arthritogenic proteases including ADAMs 17 and 10 which activate TNFα, and inhibited matrix metalloproteases, and cathepsin K. RTD-1 was non-toxic, non-immunogenic, and effective when administered as infrequently as once every five days. Thus θ-defensins, which are absent in humans, have potential as retroevolutionary biologics for the treatment of RA.","Schaal, Justin B.; Tran, Dat Q.; Subramanian, Akshay; Patel, Reshma; Laragione, Teresina; Roberts, Kevin D.; Trinh, Katie; Tongaonkar, Prasad; Tran, Patti A.; Minond, Dmitriy; Fields, Gregg B.; Beringer, Paul; Ouellette, André J.; Gulko, Percio S.; Selsted, Michael E.",PLoS One,353,26

Radiologic-pathologic correlation in one case suggests a combination of microvascular hemorrhagic and ischemic lesions that may reflect an underlying hypoxic mechanism of injury, which requires validation in larger studies. OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence, distribution, and clinical and histopathologic correlates of microvascular lesions in patients with severe COVID-19. DESIGN: Observational, retrospective cohort study: March to May 2020. SETTING: Single academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive patients (16) admitted to the intensive care unit with severe COVID-19, undergoing brain MRI for evaluation of coma or focal neurologic deficits. EXPOSURES: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Hypointense microvascular lesions identified by a prototype ultrafast high-resolution susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) MRI sequence, counted by two neuroradiologists and categorized by neuroanatomic location. Clinical and laboratory data (most recent measurements before brain MRI). Brain autopsy and cerebrospinal fluid PCR for SARS-CoV 2 in one patient who died from severe COVID-19. RESULTS: Eleven of 16 patients (69%) had punctate and linear SWI lesions in the subcortical and deep white matter, and eight patients (50%) had >10 SWI lesions. In 4/16 patients (25%), lesions involved the corpus callosum. Brain autopsy in one patient revealed that SWI lesions corresponded to widespread microvascular injury, characterized by perivascular and parenchymal petechial hemorrhages and microscopic ischemic lesions. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: SWI lesions are common in patients with neurological manifestations of severe COVID-19 (coma and focal neurologic deficits). The distribution of lesions is similar to that seen in patients with hypoxic respiratory failure, sepsis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Collectively, these radiologic and histopathologic findings suggest that patients with severe COVID-19 are at risk for multifocal microvascular hemorrhagic and ischemic lesions in the subcortical and deep white matter.","Conklin, J.; Frosch, M.

In this study, we describe a modular virus-like particle vaccine candidate displaying the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein receptor-binding domain (RBD) using SpyTag/SpyCatcher technology (RBD-SpyVLP). Low doses of RBD-SpyVLP in a prime-boost regimen induced a strong neutralising antibody response in mice and pigs that was superior to convalescent human sera. We evaluated antibody quality using ACE2 blocking and neutralisation of cell infection by pseudovirus or wild-type SARS-CoV-2. Using competition assays with a monoclonal antibody panel, we showed that RBD-SpyVLP induced a polyclonal antibody response that recognised all key epitopes on the RBD, reducing the likelihood of selecting neutralisation-escape mutants. The induction of potent and polyclonal antibody responses by RBD-SpyVLP provides strong potential to address clinical and logistic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, RBD-SpyVLP is highly resilient, thermostable and can be lyophilised without losing immunogenicity, to facilitate global distribution and reduce cold-chain dependence.","Tan, Tiong Kit; Rijal, Pramila; Rahikainen, Rolle; Keeble, Anthony H.; Schimanski, Lisa; Hussain, Saira; Harvey, Ruth; Hayes, Jack W.P.; Edwards, Jane.

Populations and species extinctions have severe implications for society through the degradation of ecosystem services. Here we assess the extinction crisis from a different perspective. We examine 29,400 species of terrestrial vertebrates, and determine which are on the brink of extinction because they have fewer than 1,000 individuals. There are 515 species on the brink (1.7% of the evaluated vertebrates). Around 94% of the populations of 77 mammal and bird species on the brink have been lost in the last century. Assuming all species on the brink have similar trends, more than 237,000 populations of those species have vanished since 1900. We conclude the human-caused sixth mass extinction is likely accelerating for several reasons. First, many of the species that have been driven to the brink will likely become extinct soon. Second, the distribution of those species highly coincides with hundreds of other endangered species, surviving in regions with high human impacts, suggesting ongoing regional biodiversity collapses. Third, close ecological interactions of species on the brink tend to move other species toward annihilation when they disappear—extinction breeds extinctions. Finally, human pressures on the biosphere are growing rapidly, and a recent example is the current coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic, linked to wildlife trade. Our results reemphasize the extreme urgency of taking much-expanded worldwide actions to save wild species and humanity’s crucial life-support systems from this existential threat.","Ceballos, Gerardo; Ehrlich, Paul R.; Raven, Peter H.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,353,16

Jordan imposed one of the strictest lockdowns from mid-March through April 2020. Hospitals deferred elective cardiac catheterization procedures and most of those performed during that period were limited to urgent presentations. Our purpose is to evaluate the impact of strict lockdown on cardiac catheterization procedural volume. METHODS AND RESULTS: We collected data about the numbers of all coronary angiography (CA) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures performed in 5 tertiary care hospitals in Amman, Jordan, from January through June 2020. We compared the volume of procedures performed in April 2020 (the strict lockdown month) to the corresponding period of prior year (April 2019) and to volumes performed prior to the lockdown in January–February 2020. There was a 64% decline in CA and PCI volumes in April 2020 compared to April 2019. Comparing number of procedures performed in April 2020 to those in January–February 2020, there was 59% decline in CA and a 60% decline in PCI volumes. Following partial lifting of lockdown in May–June 2020, procedural volumes increased gradually. CONCLUSION: Strict COVID-19-related lockdown in Jordan was associated with drastic declines in cardiac catheterization procedural volumes.","Alhaddad, Imad A.; Tabbalat, Ramzi; Hammoudeh, Ayman",Heart Views,353,30

The signs and symptoms of infection are variable, ranging from mild sore throat with minimal physical findings to high fever and severe pain. The differential diagnosis of GABHS pharyngitis is extensive. Most cases of acute pharyngitis in both children and adults are caused by viruses. The gold standard diagnostic test for GABHS remains the throat culture. It is important to select appropriate candidates for culture to maintain the sensitivity of the test. Penicillin is still recommended as first-line treatment for documented GABHS infections.

This study aimed first to describe outcomes of patients suffering from COVID-19-related ARDS treated with HFNC; secondly to evaluate safety of HFNC (patients and healthcare workers) and compare patients according to respiratory outcome. METHODS: A retrospective cohort was conducted in French general hospital intensive care unit (ICU). Patients were included if receiving HFNC for hypoxemia (saturation pulse oxygen (SpO(2)) <92% under oxygen ⩾6 L/min) associated with ARDS and positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Main clinical characteristics and outcomes are described in patients: (a) with do not intubate order (HFNC-DNIO); (b) who did not need intubation (HFNC-only); and (c) eventually intubated (HFNC-intubation). Medians are presented with (1st–3rd) interquartile range. RESULTS: From 26 February to 30 June 2020, 46 patients of median age 75 (70–79) years were included. In the HFNC-DNIO group (n = 11), partial arterial oxygen pressure (PaO(2))/inhaled fraction of oxygen (FiO(2)) ratio median worst PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio was 109 (102–172) and hospital mortality was 54.5%. Except the HFNC-DNIO patients (n = 35), 20 patients (57%) were eventually intubated (HFNC-intubation group) and 15 were only treated by HFNC (HFNC-only). HFNC-intubation patients presented higher worst respiratory rates per minute in ICU [37 (34–41) versus 33 (24–34) min, p < 0.05] and worsened ICU admission PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratios [121 (103–169) versus 191 (162–219), p < 0.001] compared with HFNC-only patients. Hospital mortality was 35% (n = 7/20) in HFNC-intubation group, 0% in HFNC-only group with a global mortality of these two groups of 20% (n = 7/35). Among tests performed in healthcare workers, 1/12 PCR in symptomatic healthcare workers and 1.8% serologies in asymptomatic healthcare workers were positive. After review of each case, COVID-19 was likely to be acquired outside hospital. CONCLUSIONS: HFNC seems to be useful for COVID-19-related ARDS and safe for healthcare workers. ARDS severity with PaO(2)/FiO(2) <150 associated with respiratory rate >35/min could be regarded as a predictor of intubation.

METHODS: Retrospective analysis of subjects undergoing PoC-RAT for COVID-19 infection at a tertiary level dedicated eye care facility. Decision making with regard to commencement of elective surgeries post COVID-19 related discontinuation of services, contact tracing of HCPs and ancillary hospital staff exposed to known COVID-19 cases and implementation of back-to-work policy for all staff based upon the results of PoC-RAT were studied. RESULTS: A total of 311 subjects (224 patients and 87 hospital staff) were tested. Overall positivity rate was around 7%. Asymptomatic patients who were screened preoperatively had a lower positivity rate at around 3% compared to the staff (who were either known contacts or were symptomatic) at around 17%. Contact tracing found three-quarters of the staff at low risk and only one quarter at medium or high risk. Among patients, 97% of those followed up for at least 2 weeks after the test remained healthy. For staff, this was around 65%. CONCLUSION: Based on our preliminary results, we suggest that PoC-RAT may be considered routinely for indication-based preoperative screening of asymptomatic patients, and for on-campus screening, contact tracing and implementation of BTW policies for HCPs and ancillary hospital staff at a tertiary level eye care facility.","Tripathy, Devjyoti; Roy, Avik Kumar; Khanna, Rohit C; Jalali, Subhadra; Panigrahy, Bharat; Parija, Deepthi Chandran; Rath, Suryasnata",Indian J Ophthalmol,353,1

We show that ExpiCHO-S™ cells produce enhanced yields of both SARS-CoV-2 S proteins. Biochemical, biophysical, and structural (cryo-EM) characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 S proteins produced in both cell lines demonstrate that the reported purification strategy yields high quality S protein (non-aggregated, uniform material with appropriate biochemical and biophysical properties). Importantly, we show that multiple preparations of these two recombinant S proteins from either cell line exhibit identical behavior in two different serology assays. We also evaluate the specificity of S protein-mediated host cell binding by examining interactions with proposed binding partners in the human secretome. In addition, the antigenicity of these proteins is demonstrated by standard ELISAs, and in a flexible protein microarray format. Collectively, we establish an array of metrics for ensuring the production of high-quality S protein to support clinical, biological, biochemical, structural and mechanistic studies to combat the global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2.","Herrera, Natalia G.; Morano, Nicholas C.; Celikgil, Alev; Georgiev, George I.; Malonis, Ryan J.; Lee, James H.; Tong, Karen; Vergnolle, Olivia; Massimi, Aldo B.; Yen, Laura Y.; Noble, Alex J.; Kopylov, Mykhailo; Bonanno, Jeffrey B.; Garrett-Thomson, Sarah C.; Hayes, David B.; Bortz, Robert H.; Wirchnianski, Ariel S.; Florez, Catalina; Laudermilch, Ethan; Haslwanter, Denise; Fels, J.

Due to limited data on its outcomes and the logistic challenges in administering the drug, MAT has not been widely used in the United States (US) despite of emergency use authorization (EUA) approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). AIM: We aim to study the outcomes of MAT in patients predominantly from ethnic minority groups and the challenges we experienced in implementing the infusion therapy protocol in an inner-city safety-net-hospital in the South Bronx. METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a retrospective observational study of 49 patients who were offered MAT as per EUA protocol of FDA. Patient who met the criteria for MAT and received therapy were included in treatment group (n = 38) and the remaining (n = 11) who declined treatment were included in the control group. A majority of patients (76%) in the study group reported symptomatic improvement, the day after infusion. There was statistically significant reduction in COVID-19 related hospitalizations (7.8 vs 54.5%, P = < 0.001) mortality (0 vs 18.1%, P value = 0.008) in the treatment group. CONCLUSION: MAT reduced both hospitalization and mortality in this predominantly Hispanic patient population with mild to moderate COVID-19 with high risk factors for disease progression.","Chilimuri, Sridhar; Mantri, Nikhitha; Gurjar, Hitesh; Youthjug, Karnokjun Annie; Sun, Haozhe; Gongati, Sudharsan; Zahid, Maleeha; Ronderos, Diana Maria; De La Cruz, Angel; Varanasi, Paavana; Shin, Dongmin; Nayudu, Suresh Kumar",J Natl Med Assoc,353,27

In Ghana, food production, both agriculture and fisheries, is exempted from restrictions as an essential service. The enforcement of COVID-19 prevention protocols, particularly social distancing, has been widely reported in Ghana’s agricultural markets whereas casual observations and media reports on fish landing sites suggest no such enforcements are in place. This study aimed to provide sound scientific evidence as a basis for informed policy direction and intervention for the artisanal fishing sector in these challenging times. We employed an unmanned aerial vehicle in assessing the risk of artisanal fishers to the pandemic using physical distancing as a proxy. From analysis of cumulative distribution function (G-function) of the nearest-neighbour distances, this study underscored crowding at all surveyed fish landing beaches, and identified potential “hotspots” for disease transmission. Aerial measurements taken at times of peak landing beach activity indicated that the highest proportion of people, representing 56%, 48%, 39% and 78% in Elmina, Winneba, Apam and Mumford respectively, were located at distances of less than one metre from their nearest neighbour. Risk of crowding was independent of the population at the landing beaches, suggesting that all categories of fish landing sites along the coast would require equal urgency and measured attention towards preventing and mitigating the spread of the disease.","Okyere, Isaac; Chuku, Ernest O.; Ekumah, Bernard; Angnuureng, Donatus B.; Boakye-Appiah, Justice K.; Mills, David J.; Babanawo, Raymond; Asare, Noble K.; Aheto, Denis W.; Crawford, Brian",Sci Rep,353,5

Many viral surface proteins exist as trimers that transition from a pre-fusion state when key NAb epitopes are exposed to a post-fusion form in which the potential for virus-cell fusion no longer exists. For optimal vaccine performance, these viral proteins are often engineered to enhance stability and presentation of these NAb epitopes. The method involves the structure-guided introduction of proline residues at key positions that maintain the trimer in the pre-fusion configuration. We review how this technique emerged during HIV-1 Env vaccine development and its subsequent wider application to other viral vaccines including SARS-CoV-2.","Sanders, Rogier W.; Moore, John P.",Cell Host Microbe,353,24
