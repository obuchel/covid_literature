2269,2269,2269,Six-month survival of critically ill patients with HIV-related disease and tuberculosis: a retrospective study,16.395607,11.074825,2016-06-10,"BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis is one of the leading causes of death from infectious diseases worldwide, mainly after the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemics. Patient with HIV-related illness are more likely to present with severe TB due to immunosuppression. Very few studies have explored HIV/TB co-infection in critically ill patients. The goal of this study was to analyze factors associated with long-term mortality in critically ill patient with HIV-related disease coinfected with TB. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study in an infectious disease reference center in Brazil that included all patient with HIV-related illness admitted to the ICU with laboratory-confirmed tuberculosis from March 2007 until June 2012. Clinical and laboratory variables were analyzed based on six-month survival. RESULTS: Forty-four patients with HIV-related illness with a confirmed diagnosis of tuberculosis were analyzed. The six-month mortality was 52 % (23 patients). The main causes of admission were respiratory failure (41 %), severe sepsis/septic shock (32 %) and coma/torpor (14 %). The median time between HIV diagnosis and ICU admission was 5 (1–60) months, and 41 % of patients received their HIV infection diagnosis ≤ 30 days before admission. The median CD4 count was 72 (IQR: 23–136) cells/mm(3). The clinical presentation was pulmonary tuberculosis in 22 patients (50 %) and disseminated TB in 20 patients (45.5 %). No aspect of TB diagnosis or treatment was different between survivors and nonsurvivors. Neurological dysfunction was more prevalent among nonsurvivors (43 % vs. 14 %, p = 0.04). The nadir CD4 cell count lower than 50 cells/mm(3) was independently associated with Six-month mortality (hazard ratio 4.58 [1.64–12.74], p < 0.01), while HIV diagnosis less than three months after positive serology was protective (hazard ratio 0.27, CI 95 % [0.10–0.72], p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: The Six-month mortality of HIV critically ill patients with TB coinfection is high and strongly associated with the nadir CD4 cell count less than 50 cels/mm(3).","Pecego, Ana Carla; Amancio, Rodrigo T.; Ribeiro, Camila; Mesquita, Emersom C.; Medeiros, Denise M.; Cerbino, José; Grinsztejn, Beatriz; Bozza, Fernando A.; Japiassu, Andre M.",BMC Infect Dis,350,3
3618,3618,3618,An Uncommon Cause of Spontaneous Pneumomediastinum and Subcutaneous Emphysema,16.812155,11.158398,2017-02-03,"A 79-year-old gentleman presented with spontaneous pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema with pneumonia but no pre-existing lung disease. He presented with a 4-day history of increased shortness of breath, pleuritic chest pain, fevers, and non-productive cough. After 4 days of intravenous antibiotics, the patient developed considerable subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. Pneumomediastinum presents most commonly with chest pain, shortness of breath, and subcutaneous emphysema. It has previously been associated with cases of pneumonia but often with rare strains such as P. jirovecii pneumonia in immunocompromised patients. This case highlights spontaneous pneumomediastinum as a rare complication of pneumonia. Treatment of pneumomediastinum is typically conservative, and although options may be limited, aggressive management of any causative factor may be essential in selected cases. LEARNING POINTS: Pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema are rare complications of pneumonia. Computerised tomography is a valuable diagnostic tool for identifying pneumomediastinum in patients with subcutaneous emphysema. While pneumomediastinum is typically a benign condition, aggressive management may occasionally be required. Evidence regarding use of non-invasive/invasive ventilation remains limited but it may theoretically aggravate any air leakage.","Edwards, Michael; Ramappa, Arun Jeenahalli",Eur J Case Rep Intern Med,350,22

METHODS: This analysis included critically ill patients with tuberculosis. The utility of APACHE-II score for predicting drug withdrawal was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. RESULTS: Among 320 patients enrolled (58 ± 22 years; 256 males), 147 (45.9%) had drugs withdrawn. The drug withdrawal group had higher APACHE-II score (median [interquartile range]: 21 [3–52] vs. 17 [4–42] points), higher CD4%, lower hemoglobin level, higher rates of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and chronic renal failure, and lower rate of extrapulmonary tuberculosis (P < 0.05). Logistic regression identified APACHE-II score > 18 (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 2.099 [1.321–3.334], P < 0.01), COPD (1.913 [1.028–3.561], P < 0.05) and hemoglobin level (0.987 [0.977–0.997], P < 0.05) as independent factors associated with drug withdrawal. At an optimal cutoff of 18.5, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of APACHE-II score for predicting drug withdrawal was 59.2, 61.8, 56.9 and 64.1%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: APACHE-II score > 18 points might predict patient tolerance of anti-tuberculosis treatment.","Qiu, Junke; Wang, Caihong; Pan, Xiaohong; Pan, Lei; Huang, Xiaoqing; Xu, Jiekun; Ji, Xiaobo; Mao, Minjie",BMC Infect Dis,350,3

It is characterised by an excessive activation of the immune system that leads to a disproportionate and destructive inflammatory response. The high mortality rates are in part due to a delay in the diagnosis, and therefore clinicians must maintain a high index of suspicion. When the treatment is started early, the survival rate reaches around 55% of cases. HLH usually presents with persistent fever, pancytopenia, and organomegaly and is associated with very high levels of serum ferritin. In this manuscript, we present the case of a patient with primary Sjögren's syndrome who developed HLH after an acute infection by Cytomegalovirus. We will describe and discuss the pathogenesis, differential diagnosis and a pragmatic approach to the treatment for this critically important and, when diagnosed early, potentially curable syndrome.","García-Montoya, L.; Sáenz-Tenorio, C.

Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors are compounds of great interest which can be used as effective agents for the symptomatic treatment of AD. Although plants are considered the largest source for these types of inhibitors, the microbial production of AChE inhibitors represents an efficient, easily manipulated, eco-friendly, cost-effective, and alternative approach. This review highlights the recent advances on the microbial production of AChE inhibitors and summarizes all the previously reported successful studies on isolation, screening, extraction, and detecting methodologies of AChE inhibitors from the microbial fermentation, from the earliest trials to the most promising anti-AD drug, huperzine A (HupA). In addition, improvement strategies for maximizing the industrial production of AChE inhibitors by microbes will be discussed. Finally, the promising applications of nano-material-based drug delivery systems for natural AChE inhibitor (HupA) will also be summarized. KEY POINTS: • AChE inhibitors are potential therapies for Alzheimer’s disease. • Microorganisms as alternate sources for prospective production of such inhibitors. • Research advances on extraction, detection, and strategies for production improvement. • Nanotechnology-based approaches for an effective drug delivery for Alzheimer’s disease.","Zaki, Amira G.; El-Sayed, El-Sayed R.; Abd Elkodous, M.; El-Sayyad, Gharieb S.",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,350,1

There are 2 phenotypes of CP, i.e., one with a rather good outcome without hypothalamic damage and another with hypothalamic damage. With hypothalamic damage, progressive disease with recurrent operations and additional cranial radiotherapy often result in hypothalamic obesity, an affected psychosocial life, and cognitive dysfunction. The morbidity and mortality are increased for particularly cerebrovascular diseases. Preoperative hypothalamic involvement to predict hypothalamic damage is important for decision making for hypothalamus-sparing surgery. Also a postoperative hypothalamic damage evaluation with the use of hypothalamus volume measurement can predict hypothalamic obesity, which is important for early treatment options. The morbidity of CP includes cognitive dysfunction with attention deficits and impaired episodic memory and processing speed. Again patients with hypothalamic damage are more affected. Treatment options of hypothalamic obesity in the chronic phase are scarce and not convincingly successful. The most optimal situation is to try to hinder or stop the evolution of hypothalamic obesity. Prevention of hypothalamic damage is recommended, with special regard to hypothalamus-sparing therapeutic approaches that respect the integrity of essential nuclei located in both the medial and the posterior hypothalamic areas.","Erfurth, Eva-Marie",Neuroendocrinology,350,6

Entity summarization task, aiming to generate diverse, comprehensive and representative summaries for entities, has received an increasing interest recently. In most previous methods, features are usually extracted by the hand-crafted templates. Then the feature selection and multi-user preference simulation take place, depending too much on human expertise. In this paper, a novel integration method called AutoSUM is proposed for automatic feature extraction and multi-user preference simulation to overcome the drawbacks of previous methods. There are two modules in AutoSUM: extractor and simulator. The extractor module operates automatic feature extraction based on a BiLSTM with a combined input representation including word embeddings and graph embeddings. Meanwhile, the simulator module automates multi-user preference simulation based on a well-designed two-phase attention mechanism (i.e., entity-phase attention and user-phase attention). Experimental results demonstrate that AutoSUM produces the state-of-the-art performance on two widely used datasets (i.e., DBpedia and LinkedMDB) in both F-measure and MAP.","Wei, Dongjun; Liu, Yaxin; Zhu, Fuqing; Zang, Liangjun; Zhou, Wei; Lu, Yijun; Hu, Songlin",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,350,6

We assessed the incidence of ICPT-related infections and colonization using culture, molecular biology, and electron microscopy. METHODS: All consecutive patients in a neurosurgical intensive care unit who had an ICPT inserted between March 2017 and February 2018 were prospectively included. Presence of colonization on the ICPTs was assessed after removal using culture, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and next-generation sequencing (NGS). RESULTS: Fifty-three ICPTs (53 patients), indwelling for a median of 4 (range 3–7) days, were studied. Median patient follow-up was 3 months. SEM, microbial culture, and NGS were performed for 91%, 79%, and 72% of ICPTs, respectively; 28 ICPTs (53%) were assessed using all three techniques. No patient developed ICPT-related infection. Microbial cultures were positive for two of the ICPTs (5%); colonization was identified on all ICPTs using NGS and SEM. Mature biofilm was observed on 35/48 (73%) of ICPTs. A median of 10 (8–12) operational taxonomic units were identified for each ICPT, most being of environmental origin. There was no association between biofilm maturity and antimicrobial treatment or duration of ICPT insertion. Antimicrobial treatment was associated with decreased alpha and beta-diversity (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: We observed no ICPT-related cerebral infections although colonization was identified on all ICPTs using NGS and SEM. Mature biofilm was the main bacterial lifestyle on the ICPTs.

Its control requires a better understanding of the mosquitoes’ live cycle, including the spatial dynamics. Several models address this issue. However, they rely on many hard to measure parameters. This work presents a model describing the spatial population dynamics of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes using partial differential equations (PDEs) relying on a few parameters. METHODS: We show how to estimate model parameter values from the experimental data found in the literature using concepts from dynamical systems, genetic algorithm optimization and partial differential equations. We show that our model reproduces some analytical formulas relating the carrying capacity coefficient to experimentally measurable quantities as the maximum number of mobile female mosquitoes, the maximum number of eggs, or the maximum number of larvae. As an application of the presented methodology, we replicate one field experiment numerically and investigate the effect of different frequencies in the insecticide application in the urban environment. RESULTS: The numerical results suggest that the insecticide application has a limited impact on the mosquitoes population and that the optimal application frequency is close to one week. CONCLUSIONS: Models based on partial differential equations provide an efficient tool for simulating mosquitoes’ spatial population dynamics. The reduced model can reproduce such dynamics on a sufficiently large scale. [Image: see text]","Silva, Monalisa R.; Lugão, Pedro H. G.; Chapiro, Grigori",Parasit Vectors,350,16

As such, several studies have screened FDA‐approved drugs in silico at a limited number of classical antiviral sites for anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 activity. We hypothesized that an extensive in‐silico drug repurposingscreen against a wide range of SARS‐COV‐2 proteins could identify novel antiviral drugs and help elucidate mechanisms of drug action of hits from in vitro screens. We selected 48 known or predicted drug sites across 23 SARS‐COV‐2 proteins using homology models and crystal structures based on known antiviral drug sites (i.e., polymerase or protease active sites), computational predictions, and protein‐protein interfaces. Then, using the software GOLD, we docked 1268 FDA‐approved small‐molecule drugs into each site. Virtual hits were prioritized based on their anti‐SARS‐COV‐2 activity found in a recent phenotypic drug‐repurposing screen using human huh‐7 epithelial cells. This resulted in the identification of a range of drugs acting at a variety of targets and sites. Several compelling drug/site pairs were identified, including sites on the Spike protein, which mediates viral entry. For example, we identified hits with anti‐SARS‐CoV2 activity in vitro, at a putative allosteric site that incorporates two functionalities required for viral entry, namely the Spike S2’ cleavage site – which a host protease must cleave for viral entry, and the critical ‘fusion peptide’ domain – which injects itself into the host membrane during viral entry. Moreover, these in silico results identify possible mechanisms for in vitro drug repurposing hits, potential additional targets for known drugs, and a starting point to test drug combinations that may have better activity by acting at different steps in the viral cycle activity in combination than on their own. 8.5.5","Olson, Keith; Chan, Wallace; Sexton, Jonathon; Carlson, Heather; Traynor, John",FASEB J,350,16

In women, laparoscopic treatment of ORS is successful and has significant advantages over laparotomy. Since laparoscopic ovariectomy has significant advantages over open ovariectomy in dogs, including reduced surgical stress and postoperative pain and shorter convalescence period, the rationale for a laparoscopic approach of canine ORS is evident. Feasibility and efficacy of a laparoscopic approach for treatment of ORS in dogs was prospectively evaluated using a standardized protocol for diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up. Treatment success was evaluated by histology of removed tissues, postoperative hormone testing, and long-term clinical follow-up. RESULTS Thirty-two client-owned predominantly medium and large breed dogs diagnosed with ORS underwent abdominal ultrasound for ovarian remnant localization prior to laparoscopic surgery for removal of ovarian remnants. Tissue dissection and excision was performed using a vessel sealing forceps. Laparoscopy subjectively enabled detailed visibility and facilitated detection and removal of suspected ovarian tissue in all cases. Histology confirmed ovarian origin of removed tissue in all dogs. Additionally, a GnRH stimulation test was performed in fourteen dogs after a median follow-up of 10.5 months, which verified absence of residual functional ovarian remnant tissue in all dogs. Median surgery duration was 97.5 min and mean total convalescence duration, subjectively scored by owners, was 1.5 ± 0.7 days. No major complications occurred. Adhesions were observed in 79% of the dogs, complicated the surgical approach, and significantly affected surgery duration (85 versus 109 min; p = 0.03). Minor hemorrhage occurred in 12% and significantly increased surgery duration (95.5 versus 128 min; p = 0.02). Trendelenburg position and lateral tilting of the patient were essential for proper access to ovarian remnants. GnRH stimulation test results and/or absence of clinical signs indicative of ORS after a median follow-up period of 22.5 months confirmed treatment efficacy in all dogs. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic surgery for ORS in dogs is effective with minimal complications and short convalescence and can successfully replace the conventional, more invasive open surgical procedure.","van Nimwegen, Sebastiaan A; Van Goethem, Bart; de Gier, Jeffrey; Kirpensteijn, Jolle",BMC veterinary research,350,19

METHODS The data were from three different national surveys: the Third National Health Services Survey in 2003, the Fourth National Health Services Survey in 2008 and the national health-care reform phased assessment survey in 2011. There were 151421, 143380 and 48356 respondents aged 15 years or older in 2003, 2008 and 2011, respectively. RESULTS The health insurance coverage expanded considerably from 27.7% in 2003 to 96.4% in 2011 among respondents aged 15 years or older. Hospitalization rate increased rapidly from 4.1% in 2003 to 9.6% in 2011. Urban respondents had higher hospital admissions than rural respondents, and the RR (95% CI) of hospitalization was 1.23 (1.17-1.30), 1.06 (1.02-1.10) and 1.16 (1.10-1.23) in 2003, 2008 and 2011, respectively. The urban-rural disparity in hospital admissions significantly narrowed over time. Urban respondents had a higher admission rate if insured and a lower admission if not insured than their rural counterparts. Of the six medical expenditure measures, the disparities in reimbursement rate and the proportion of hospitalization direct cost to the total consumer spending significantly narrowed. CONCLUSIONS The health insurance coverage has been continually expanding and health service utilization has been substantially improved. Urban-rural disparities have been narrowed but still exist. Therefore, policy-makers should focus on increasing investment and reimbursement levels, developing a uniform standard health insurance system for urban and rural residents and improving the medical assistance system.","Fu, Rong; Wang, Yupeng; Bao, Han; Wang, Zhiqiang; Li, Yongquan; Su, Shaofei; Liu, Meina",PloS one,350,26

We aimed at analyzing possible risk factors for failure of fascial closure and the risk of fistulas after nontrauma lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract surgery treated with OA. METHODS This retrospective study included 101 nontrauma patients treated with OA from 2007 to 2011. Multivariate analyses of risk factors were performed. RESULTS Indications for OA were diffuse peritonitis (n = 47), need for second look (n = 26), failure to achieve fascial closure (e.g., bowel edema) at primary laparotomy (n = 24), and fascial necrosis (n = 4). Of the 101 patients, 61 (60 %) were alive at discharge, with one death possibly related to OA (fistula from an iatrogenic perforation). Delayed fascial closure was obtained in 40 (66 %) of the surviving patients, with 80 % when the indications for OA was need for second look and 72 % in cases of diffuse peritonitis. Compared with need for second look [hazard ratio (HR = 1), 95 % CI], proportional HR for failure of delayed fascial closure were peritonitis 1.96 (1.10-3.49) and failure to achieve fascial closure at primary laparotomy 4.70 (2.17-10.2). In the presence of a stoma the HR was 2.02 (1.13-3.63). CONCLUSIONS OA using NPWT seems to be a safe procedure, with few procedure-related complications. Failure of fascial closure is related to the indication of OA and the presence of a stoma. Prospective multicenter studies are needed to establish which patients with lower GI surgery benefit from OA.","Bertelsen, Claus Anders; Fabricius, Rasmus; Kleif, Jakob; Kristensen, Bent; Gögenur, Ismail",World journal of surgery,350,31

The purpose of the current article was to assess the populations' perception of DTCOs and to examine various factors that may influence their decision in choosing treatment with DTCO products. METHODS A cross-sectional population-based survey was conducted in the United States. The 35-question survey was disseminated through Amazon Mechanical Turk (Amazon.com, Inc, Seattle, Wash), and participants were asked questions about their demographics, their perceptions of DTCOs, orthodontists, and factors that may influence their decision should they decide to pursue orthodontic treatment. Pearson's correlations were conducted to assess the association between various factors and the participants' likelihood to choose DTCO products. RESULTS A total of 1441 subjects participated in the study. More than 83% of the participants have considered pursuing orthodontic treatment to some extent. Twenty-three percent reported that they would highly likely choose DTCO products. The majority of participants reported convenience to be the greatest benefit of DTCOs, followed by cost. The majority of responses seemed to favor DTCOs. Forty-seven percent reported that the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic did not affect their preference, whereas 26.6% reported to be more likely to pursue DTCOs because of the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS The majority of participants seemed to perceive DTCOs as a viable alternative for seeking orthodontic care. Although participants had concerns about the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, results showed that the pandemic might not significantly affect the preferences. Orthodontists and their constituent organizations may consider more robust awareness and advocacy campaigns to educate the population about orthodontic treatment and the benefits of pursuing treatment with a trained orthodontist.","Bous, Rany M; Apostolopoulos, Konstantinos; Valiathan, Manish","American journal of orthodontics and dentofacial orthopedics : official publication of the American Association of Orthodontists, its constituent societies, and the American Board of Orthodontics",350,27

The glycosyltransferase ST6Gal-I is known to block homeostatic apoptosis through α2,6-linked sialylation of the death receptor TNFR1 in many cell types. However, its role has not been investigated in gastric epithelial cells or gastric tumorigenesis. We determined that human gastric antral epithelium rarely expressed ST6Gal-I, but the number of ST6Gal-I-expressing epithelial cells increased significantly with advancing premalignancy leading to cancer. The mRNA expression level of ST6GAL-I and SOX9 in human gastric epithelial cells correlated positively with one another through the premalignancy cascade, indicating that increased epithelial cell expression of ST6Gal-I is associated with premalignant progression. To determine the functional impact of increased ST6Gal-I, we generated human gastric antral organoids from epithelial stem cells and differentiated epithelial monolayers from gastric organoids. Gastric epithelial stem cells strongly expressed ST6Gal-I, suggesting a novel biomarker of stemness. In contrast, organoid-derived epithelial monolayers expressed markedly reduced ST6Gal-I and underwent TNF-induced, caspase-mediated apoptosis, consistent with homeostasis. Conversely, epithelial monolayers generated from gastric cancer stem cells retained high levels of ST6Gal-I and resisted TNF-induced apoptosis, supporting prolonged survival. Protection from TNF-induced apoptosis was dependent on ST6Gal-I overexpression, since forced ST6Gal-I overexpression in normal gastric stem cell-differentiated monolayers inhibited TNF-induced apoptosis, and cleavage of α2,6-linked sialic acids from gastric cancer organoid-derived monolayers restored susceptibility to TNF-induced apoptosis. These findings implicate upregulated ST6Gal-I expression in blocking homeostatic epithelial cell apoptosis in gastric cancer pathogenesis, suggesting a mechanism for prolonged epithelioid tumor cell survival.","Alexander, Katie L; Serrano, Carolina A; Chakraborty, Asmi; Nearing, Marie; Council, Leona N; Riquelme, Arnoldo; Garrido, Marcelo; Bellis, Susan L; Smythies, Lesley E; Smith, Phillip D",The Journal of biological chemistry,350,25

Using different statistical approaches, we compared the functional independence rates at 3 months among patients undergoing primary endovascular therapy and patients treated only with IV thrombolysis. METHODS We used data from a prospective, government-mandated and externally audited registry of reperfusion therapies for ischemic stroke (January 2011 to November 2012). Patients were selected if treated with either IV thrombolysis alone (n = 1,582) or primary endovascular thrombectomy (n = 250). A series of exclusions were made to homogenize the clinical characteristics among the two groups. We then carried out multivariate logistic regression and propensity score matching analyses on the final study sample (n = 1,179) to compare functional independence at 3 months, as measured by the modified Rankin scale scores 0-2, between the two groups. RESULTS The unadjusted likelihood of good outcome was poorer among the endovascular group (OR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.47-1.0). After adjustment, no differences by treatment modality were seen (OR: 1.51; 95% CI: 0.93-2.43 for primary endovascular therapy). Patients undergoing endovascular thrombectomy within 180-270 min (OR: 2.89; 95% CI: 1.17-7.15) and patients with severe strokes (OR: 1.84; 95% CI: 1.02-3.35) did better than their intravenous thrombolysis counterparts. The propensity score-matched analyses with and without adjustment by additional covariates showed that endovascular thrombectomy was as effective as intravenous thrombolysis alone in achieving functional independence (OR for unadjusted propensity score matched: 1.35; 95% CI: 0.9-2.02, OR for adjusted propensity score matched: 1.45; 95% CI: 0.91-2.32). CONCLUSION This comparative effectiveness study shows that in ischemic stroke patients with contraindications for IV thrombolysis, primary endovascular treatment might be an alternative therapy at least as effective as IV thrombolysis alone. Randomized controlled trials are urgently needed.","Abilleira, Sònia; Ribera, Aida; Dávalos, Antonio; Ribó, Marc; Chamorro, Angel; Cardona, Pere; Molina, Carlos A; Martínez-Yélamos, Antonio; Urra, Xabier; Dorado, Laura; Roquer, Jaume; Martí-Fàbregas, Joan; Aja, Lucía; Tomasello, Alejandro; Castaño, Carlos; Blasco, Jordi; Cánovas, David; Castellanos, Mar; Krupinski, Jerzy; Guimaraens, Leopoldo; Perendreu, Joan; Ustrell, Xavier; Purroy, Francisco; Gómez-Choco, Manuel; Baiges, Joan Josep; Cocho, Dolores; Saura, Júlia; Gallofré, Miquel",Cerebrovascular diseases,350,33

METHODOLOGY Patients who underwent LRSG following LSG due to inadequate weight loss or weight regain retrospectively evaluated. Patients' demographics, comorbidities, and bariatric surgery outcomes, as well as hospitalisation rate, excess weight loss percentage (EWL%), and body mass index (BMI ) were recorded. Scheduled follow-up visits after surgery at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-surgery and every six months subsequently were done. RESULTS A total of 21 patients that underwent LRSG after LRG due to inadequate weight loss or a regain in weight. Of them, 7 (33.3%) were males, and 14 (66.7%) were females. The mean body weight index (BMI) before primary LSG was 52.3 ±4.7 Kg/m² and EWL% was 32.7 ±4.6. After an average follow-up of 24 months. BMI of patients before LRSG was 46.1 ±4.3 Kg/m². Following a 1-year observation, there was a substantial (p<0.001) improvement in BMI (21.6 ±3.1 Kg/m 2 ) and excess weight loss percentage (86.82% of EWL).

Here, three commercially available assays with widespread distribution capabilities are compared. A total of 667 specimens, 103 from patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and 564 collected prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, were analyzed in parallel using the Roche Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 Total Antibody and Abbott Alinity SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays; a subset of 55 samples from patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections was additionally evaluated using the Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgM assay. Qualitative percent agreement between the Abbott IgG and Roche total antibody assays was 98.7% (658/667), with Cohen's kappa 0.919 (95% CI 0.867-0.972). Qualitative percent agreement with the Abbott IgM assay was 92.7% (51/55, Abbott IgG) and 85.5% (47/55, Roche total antibody). Diagnostic specificities determined using pre-COVID-19 samples for the Abbott IgG and Roche total antibody assays were 99.65% (95% CI 98.72-99.90%) and 100.00% (95% CI 99.32-100.00%), respectively, spanning claims made by each manufacturer. Diagnostic sensitivities increased for all three assays with increasing time since the onset of symptoms. Among 51 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, 23 (45.1%), 24 (47.1%), and 22 (43.1%) were reactive by the Abbott IgG, Roche total antibody, and Abbott IgM assays, respectively, with sampling times 0-56 days post-positive PCR (median/mean 2/6.2 days). Combining IgG and IgM screening identified 4/55 additional samples with detectable antibodies that would not have been observed using the assays independently. Notably, one immunocompromised patient with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection showed no detectable antibodies using any of the three assays 43 days after onset of symptoms.","Harley, Kellisha; Gunsolus, Ian",Journal of clinical microbiology,350,1

Clinically meaningful data, such as overall survival (OS) and quality of life, are often only presented in subsequent publications. We examined if the clinical benefit of cancer drugs, as measured by the European Society for Medical Oncology Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale (ESMO-MCBS), improves post-European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval as more data emerges. METHODS Cancer drug indications approved by the EMA from January 2006 to December 2016 were reviewed and trials cited for efficacy were identified. Primary and subsequent publications (up to December 2019) of scorable trials were included. Changes in benefit over time were measured using ESMO-MCBS thresholds for non-curative (≥4 for substantial, =3 for intermediate and ≤2 for low benefit) and curative intent (A or B for major benefit) scoring. RESULTS Fifty-five non-curative and two curative intent trials were included. At approval, 29.1% of non-curative trials were substantial, 45.5% intermediate and 25.5% low benefit. For curative intent trials, one displayed major benefit and one displayed no major benefit. We identified 82 subsequent publications for reassessment. A change in ESMO-MCBS classification was seen in 34.5% of non-curative trials (11 raised and 8 lowered). At 3-year reassessment, 36.4% of non-curative trials were substantial, 34.5% intermediate and 29.1% low benefit. Both curative trials showed no major benefit at reassessment. CONCLUSION As over a third of trials changed classification, in either direction, reassessing the ESMO-MCBS score of approved cancer drugs may help to inform patients and ensure ongoing relevance of regulatory and reimbursement decisions.","Thomson, Sasha; Witzke, Noah; Gyawali, Bishal; Delos Santos, Seanthel; Udayakumar, Suji; Cardone, Claudia; Cheung, Matthew C; Chan, Kelvin K W",European journal of cancer,350,1

Many studies have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of original POSE for the treatment of obesity. OBJECTIVE We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of available literature in an attempt to evaluate the outcomes of original POSE per the ASGE task force thresholds. METHODS Bibliographic databases were systematically searched for studies assessing the outcomes of POSE for the treatment of obesity. All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies that assessed outcomes of POSE were included. Studies were included if they reported percent total weight loss (%TWL) or percent excess weight loss (%EWL) and the incidence of serious adverse events (SAE). RESULTS A total of seven studies with 613 patients were included. Two included studies were RCTs, while the remaining were observational studies. Pooled mean %EWL at 3-6 months and 12-15 months were 42.62 (95% CI 37.56-47.68) and 48.86 (95% CI 42.31-55.41), respectively. Pooled mean %TWL at 3-6 months and 12-15 months was 13.45 (95% CI 8.93-17.97) and 12.68 (95% CI 8.13-17.23), respectively. Subgroup analysis of two RCTs showed that weight loss at 1 year was significantly higher in POSE patients (%EWL difference in means 19.45 (95% CI 4.65-34.24, p value = 0.01). The overall incidence of serious adverse events was only 2.84% and included GI bleeding, extra-gastric bleeding, hepatic abscess, severe pain, severe nausea, and severe vomiting. The mean number of total anchors placed in the fundus and body was 13.18 (95% CI 11.77-14.58), and the mean procedure time was 44.55 min (95% CI 36.44-52.65). CONCLUSION POSE, a minimally invasive endoscopic bariatric therapy, is a safe and effective modality for the treatment of obesity. The outcomes of POSE meet and surpass the ASGE joint task force thresholds. Future studies should evaluate newer versions of this procedure that emphasize gastric body plication sparing the fundus.","Singh, Shailendra; Bazarbashi, Ahmad Najdat; Khan, Ahmad; Chowdhry, Monica; Bilal, Mohammad; de Moura, Diogo Turiani Hourneaux; Jirapinyo, Pichamol; Thakkar, Shyam; Thompson, Christopher C",Surgical endoscopy,350,23

Circular inference is one such possible impairment, in which excitation-to-inhibition imbalances in the cerebral cortex cause the reverberation and amplification of prior beliefs and sensory information. Recent empirical work has associated circular inference with the clinical dimensions of schizophrenia. Inhibition impairments have also been observed in autism, suggesting that signal reverberation might be present in that condition as well. In this study, we collected data from 21 participants with self-reported diagnoses of autism spectrum disorders and 155 participants with a broad range of autistic traits in an online probabilistic decision-making task (the fisher task). We used previously established Bayesian models to investigate possible associations between autistic traits or autism and circular inference. There was no correlation between prior or likelihood reverberation and autistic traits across the whole sample. Similarly, no differences in any of the circular inference model parameters were found between autistic participants and those with no diagnosis. Furthermore, participants incorporated information from both priors and likelihoods in their decisions, with no relationship between their weights and psychiatric traits, contrary to what common theories for both autism and schizophrenia would suggest. These findings suggest that there is no increased signal reverberation in autism, despite the known presence of excitation-to-inhibition imbalances. They can be used to further contrast and refine the Bayesian theories of schizophrenia and autism, revealing a divergence in the computational mechanisms underlying the two conditions.","Chrysaitis, Nikitas Angeletos; Jardri, Renaud; Denève, Sophie; Seriès, Peggy",PLoS computational biology,350,19

OBJECTIVE To determine the safety and effectiveness of PCD in children with perforated appendicitis and to identify any variables of prognostic value. MATERIALS & METHODS We retrospectively evaluated clinical data and imaging features for 33 children undergoing PCD for periappendiceal abscess from October 2006 to February 2010. Those with preprocedural CT studies were assigned to one of three risk categories based on imaging features. RESULTS Appendectomy was successfully postponed for all patients. Our technical success rate was 87.9%, with three recurrences (two requiring repeat drainage, one managed conservatively) and one possible complication (enterocutaneous fistula formation). Children with large and diffuse abscesses had a 50% rate of technical failure, which was significantly increased when compared to children with large but localized abscesses (P < 0.028). Extraluminal appendicolith, extraluminal gas, leukocytosis, ileus/obstruction and procedural variables were not reliable predictors of outcome. CONCLUSION PCD can be effective for managing perforated appendicitis in children.

In this Perspective, the authors examine both the short- and longer-term implications of these cancellations, including the effects on the professional development and advancement of junior faculty and learners. While the COVID-19 pandemic is new in 2020, impediments to conference attendance and participation are not. Cost, personal responsibilities at home, and clinical duties have always restricted attendance. The authors argue that the unprecedented hardships of this pandemic present a unique opportunity to reimagine how conferences can be conducted and to rethink what it means to be part of an academic community. While there are challenges with this digital transformation of academia, there are also undeniable opportunities: online abstracts and recorded presentations enable wider viewership, virtual sessions permit wider participation and greater interactivity, and the elimination of travel facilitates more diverse expert panel participation.

Subsequently, persons with suspected cases of infection and contacts of those with suspected infection were tested. Persons in whom infection was confirmed were hospitalized and quarantined, and some of them were closely observed for the purpose of investigating the nature and duration of the disease. METHODS During May and June 2009, we observed 426 persons infected with the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus who were quarantined in 61 hospitals in 20 provinces. Real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) testing was used to confirm infection, the clinical features of the disease were closely monitored, and 254 patients were treated with oseltamivir within 48 hours after the onset of disease. RESULTS The mean age of the 426 patients was 23.4 years, and 53.8% were male. The diagnosis was made at ports of entry (in 32.9% of the patients), during quarantine (20.2%), and in the hospital (46.9%). The median incubation period of the virus was 2 days (range, 1 to 7). The most common symptoms were fever (in 67.4% of the patients) and cough (69.5%). The incidence of diarrhea was 2.8%, and the incidence of nausea and vomiting was 1.9%. Lymphopenia, which was common in both adults (68.1%) and children (92.3%), typically occurred on day 2 (range, 1 to 3) and resolved by day 7 (range, 6 to 9). Hypokalemia was observed in 25.4% of the patients. Duration of fever was typically 3 days (range, 1 to 11). The median length of time during which patients had positive real-time RT-PCR test results was 6 days (range, 1 to 17). Independent risk factors for prolonged real-time RT-PCR positivity included an age of less than 14 years, male sex, and a delay from the onset of symptoms to treatment with oseltamivir of more than 48 hours. CONCLUSIONS Surveillance of the 2009 H1N1 virus in China shows that the majority of those infected have a mild illness. The typical period during which the virus can be detected with the use of real-time RT-PCR is 6 days (whether or not fever is present). The duration of infection may be shortened if oseltamivir is administered.","Cao, Bin; Li, Xing-Wang; Mao, Yu; Wang, Jian; Lu, Hong-Zhou; Chen, Yu-Sheng; Liang, Zong-An; Liang, Lirong; Zhang, Su-Juan; Zhang, Bin; Gu, Li; Lu, Lian-He; Wang, Da-Yan; Wang, Chen",The New England journal of medicine,350,1

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA Surgical trainee wellness is a critical priority among surgical educators and leaders. The impact of surgical training on the wellness of loved ones who support trainees has not been previously studied. METHODS This qualitative study employs semi-structured interviews of 32 support persons of surgical trainees at a single tertiary care center with multiple surgical specialty training programs. Interviews focused on perceptions about supporting a surgical trainee. Transcripts underwent thematic analysis with semantic and conceptual coding. Key themes regarding the effects that caring for a trainee has on support persons are reported. RESULTS Three key themes were identified: (1) Sacrifices-support persons report significant tangible and intangible sacrifices, (2) Delaying life-life is placed on hold to prioritize training, and (3) A disconnect-there is a disconnect and a lack of recognition of support person needs that require greater awareness and targeted interventions. CONCLUSIONS The impact of surgical training can extend beyond trainees and can affect the wellness of their support persons who endure the effects of training alongside trainees. Programs should be aware of these effects and develop meaningful strategies to aid trainees and their support persons.","Evans, Julie; Kemp, Michael T; Rivard, Samantha J; Sharma, Sriganesh B; Williams, Aaron M; Coleman, Dawn; Dimick, Justin; Sandhu, Gurjit",Annals of surgery,350,16

We compared the Nociceptive Flexion Reflex Threshold (NFRT), Bispectral Index (BIS), Composite Variability Index (CVI), Noxious Stimulation Response Index (NSRI) and the calculated propofol/remifentanil effect-compartment concentrations (Ce) as predictors for such responses in 50 female subjects at laryngeal mask airway insertion and skin incision. The following prediction probabilities (PK-values) were obtained at laryngeal mask airway insertion and skin incision, respectively. For movement responses: NFRT = 0.77 and 0.72; p = 0.0001 and 0.004, respectively; BIS = 0.41 and 0.56, p = 0.29 and 0.5, respectively; CVI = 0.48 and 0.57, p = 0.76 and 0.88, respectively; NSRI = 0.49 and 0.76, p = 0.92 and 0.0001, respectively; propofol-Ce = 0.35 and 0.66, p = 0.04 and 0.03, respectively; remifentanil-Ce = 0.68 and 0.72, p = 0.01 and 0.003, respectively. For heart rate responses: NFRT = 0.68 and 0.75, p = 0.04 and 0.01, respectively; BIS = 0.37 and 0.59, p = 0.15 and 0.41, respectively; CVI = 0.41 and 0.44, p = 0.39 and 0.37, respectively; NSRI = 0.48 and 0.53, p = 0.84 and 0.78, respectively; propofol-Ce = 0.42 and 0.56, p = 0.39 and 0.53, respectively; remifentanil-Ce = 0.58 and 0.54, p = 0.35 and 0.73, respectively.

New lagoons have been built using modern technologies to optimize water use and waste recycling, as well as increasing the green spaces around the country. To achieve successful development of these new lagoons, lessons should be learned from the old ponds by examining their biodiversity, ecology, and the roles played by aquatic plants and algae to remediate wastewaters at these ponds. The perspectives of using IWW (from oil and gas activities), that is currently pumped deep into the ground are presented. Instead of causing great damage to groundwater, IWW can be stored in artificial ponds prepared for ridding it of all impurities and pollutants of various types, organic and inorganic, thereby making it serviceable for various human uses. Phycoremediation, bioremediation, and phytoremediation methods adopted by algae, bacteria and aquatic native plants are discussed, and special attention should be paid to those that proved successful in removing heavy metals and degrading organic compounds. At least three native plants namely: Amaranthus viridis, Phragmites australis, and Typha domingensis should be paid special attention, since these plants are efficient in remediation of arsenic and mercury; elements found abundantly in wastewater of gas activities. Some promising modern and innovative experiences and biotechnologies to develop efficient transgenic plants and microorganisms in removing and degrading pollutants are discussed, as an important strategy to keep the ecosystem clean and safe. Novelty statement Industrial wastewater (IWW) could be an alternative source of water at the Arabian Gulf region. Currently, IWW is pumped deep into the ground causing a great damage to groundwater; little information about this issue has been reported. Such IWW can be stored in artificial ponds designed for ridding them of all impurities of various types; various remediation methods can be used.

BACKGROUND IPTEs occurring during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are associated with adverse in-hospital and late outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndromes. METHODS A total of 6,591 patients who underwent PCI for non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes/ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction in the ACUITY (Acute Catheterization and Urgent Intervention Triage StrategY) and HORIZONS-AMI (Harmonizing Outcomes with RevascularIZatiON and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction) trials underwent detailed frame-by-frame core laboratory angiographic analysis to assess for IPTEs. The associations of IPTE components with death, major bleeding, and major adverse cardiac events at 30 days were assessed using univariable analyses and multivariable models. RESULTS The overall incidence of IPTEs was 7.7%, with a greater incidence in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients (12.2%) compared with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes patients (3.5%). Specific components of IPTEs included no-reflow/slow reflow in 58.0%, new/worsened thrombus in 35.3%, distal embolization in 34.9%, abrupt closure in 19.8%, and intraprocedural stent thrombosis (IPST) in 9.5% of patients. Each IPTE component was independently associated with 30-day death, major bleeding, and MACE in multivariable models, with the strongest association observed for IPST (MACE hazard ratio: 7.51 [95% confidence interval: 4.36 to 12.94]). CONCLUSIONS The occurrence of IPTEs is not infrequent among high-risk acute coronary syndromes patients undergoing PCI, and each IPTE component was associated with subsequent adverse events. Although IPST represented <10% of IPTE events overall, it was the component with the strongest association with adverse events.","Wessler, Jeffrey D; Généreux, Philippe; Mehran, Roxana; Ayele, Girma Minalu; Brener, Sorin J; McEntegart, Margaret; Ben-Yehuda, Ori; Stone, Gregg W; Kirtane, Ajay J",JACC.

It is considered that acotiamide acts as an antagonist on muscarinic autoreceptors in the enteric nervous system and inhibits acetylcholinesterase activity. We examined the effect of acotiamide on gastric emptying in healthy adult humans. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twelve healthy adult males were enrolled in this double-blind crossover study. Acotiamide or placebo was administered orally in the 12 subjects 30 min before ingestion of a nutritional liquid meal (400 Kcal/400 mL). Six of the 12 participants took 100 mg of acotiamide or placebo, and six of the 12 participants took 300 mg of acotiamide or placebo in a double-blind crossover fashion. All subjects underwent measurement of gastric emptying by the (13) C breath test. RESULTS After the meal with placebo was ingested, the %dose/h curve ascended. The %dose/h curve after a meal with 100 or 300 mg of acotiamide ascended in an identical manner compared with the results with placebo. No significant differences were observed at any studied time point, and there were no significant changes in gastric emptying parameters (gastric emptying coefficient, t-1/2ex and t-lag ex). CONCLUSIONS A single administration of 100 or 300 mg of acotiamide did not affect gastric emptying after a liquid meal in healthy adult humans. Acotiamide has profound effects on restoring delayed gastric emptying and impaired accommodation in patients with FD but may have no effect on gastric emptying in healthy subjects. Such pharmacological actions have not been observed in previous gastroprokinetic studies.","Zai, Hiroaki; Matsueda, Kei; Kusano, Motoyasu; Urita, Yoshihisa; Saito, Youichi; Kato, Hiroki",European journal of clinical investigation,350,24

The virulence of Shigella relies upon a type III secretion system (T3SS) which injects host altering effector proteins into targeted intestinal cells. The Shigella T3SS contains two components, invasion plasmid antigen D (IpaD) and invasion plasmid antigen B (IpaB), that were previously identified as broadly protective antigens. When IpaD and IpaB were co-expressed to give the DB fusion (DBF) protein, vaccine efficacy was further improved. Biophysical characterization under various pH conditions showed that DBF is most stable at pH 7 and 8 and loses its conformational integrity at 48 and 50 oC respectively. Forced degradation studies revealed significant effects on the secondary structure, tertiary structure and conformational stability of DBF. In the presence of phosphate buffers as well as other anionic excipients, DBF demonstrated a concentration dependent conformational stabilization. Molecular docking revealed potential polyanion binding sites in DBF that may interact with phytic acid. These sites can be exploited to stabilize the DBF protein. This work highlights potential destabilizing and stabilizing factors, which not only improves our understanding of the DBF protein but helps in future development of a stable Shigella vaccine.","Jain, Akshay; Hu, Gang; Kumar Ratnakaram, Siva Sai; Johnson, David K; Picking, William D; Picking, Wendy L; Middaugh, Charles Russell",Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,350,25

Our aim was to compare the visualization of neurointerventional procedures and treatment devices using a 194-μm pixel flat panel detector mode and a 76-μm pixel complementary metal oxide semiconductor detector mode (high definition) of a new-generation x-ray detector system using a blinded-rater study. MATERIALS AND METHODS Deployment of flow-diversion devices for the treatment of internal carotid artery aneurysms was performed under flat panel detector and high-definition-mode image guidance in a neurointerventional phantom simulating patient cranium and tissue attenuation, embedded with 3D-printed intracranial vascular models, each with an aneurysm in the ICA segment. Image-sequence pairs of device deployments for each detector mode, under similar exposure and FOV conditions, were evaluated by 2 blinded experienced neurointerventionalists who independently selected their preferred image on the basis of visualization of anatomic features, image noise, and treatment device. They rated their selection as either similar, better, much better, or substantially better than the other choice. Inter- and intrarater agreement was calculated and categorized as poor, moderate, and good. RESULTS Both raters demonstrating good inter- and intrarater agreement selected high-definition-mode images with a frequency of at least 95% each and, on average, rated the high-definition images as much better than flat panel detector images with a frequency of 73% from a total of 60 image pairs. CONCLUSIONS Due to their higher resolution, high-definition-mode images are sharper and visually preferred compared with the flat panel detector images. The improved imaging provided by the high-definition mode can potentially provide an advantage during neurointerventional procedures.","Setlur Nagesh, S V; Fennel, V; Krebs, J; Ionita, C; Davies, J; Bednarek, D R; Mokin, M; Siddiqui, A H; Rudin, S",AJNR.

This rescue therapy can be performed with moderate conscious sedation (CS) or general anesthesia (GA). The effect of GA on clinical outcome in AIS remains controversial. Therefore, we retrospectively investigated whether the use of CS or GA during endovascular intervention for AIS influenced outcomes. METHODS Patients who underwent emergent endovascular intervention for intracranial arterial occlusion during the years 2006 to 2012 were included in this study. Statistical analysis using the Spearman ρ was performed to examine demographic data and clinical outcomes between patients in the GA and CS groups. Binary logistic regression was used to determine the predictors of mortality. RESULTS A total of 109 patients fit the inclusion criteria. Among them, 35 patients had GA and 74 patients had CS. Patients needing intubation upon admission for airway protection were more likely to receive GA (P<0.001). The duration of the procedure and the time-to-revascularization from symptom onset were significantly longer in the GA group. Mortality was higher in the GA group compared with the CS group (40% vs. 22%, P=0.045). Multivariate analysis, controlled for confounding variables, identified GA and elevated postprocedure glucose level to be significant predictors of mortality. CONCLUSIONS Larger prospectively randomized multicenter trials evaluating the effects of GA and CS on clinical and radiographic outcomes seems warranted.","Li, Fenghua; Deshaies, Eric M; Singla, Amit; Villwock, Mark R; Melnyk, Vladyslav; Gorji, Reza; Yang, Zhong-jin",Journal of neurosurgical anesthesiology,350,1

We aimed to explore the acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine and related factors among pregnant women, a vulnerable population for vaccine-preventable diseases.Methods: A multi-center cross-sectional study among pregnant women was conducted in five provinces of mainland China from November 13 to 27, 2020. We collected sociodemographic characteristics, attitude, knowledge, and health beliefs on COVID-19 vaccination. Locally weighted scatterplot smoothing regression analysis was used to assess the trends of vaccination acceptance. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify factors related to vaccination acceptance.Results: Among the 1392 pregnant women, the acceptance rate of a COVID-19 vaccine were 77.4% (95%CI 75.1-79.5%). In the multivariable regression model, the acceptance rate was associated with young age (aOR = 1.87, 95% CI: 1.20-2.93), western region (aOR = 2.73, 95% CI: 1.72-4.32), low level of education (aOR = 2.49, 95% CI: 1.13-5.51), late pregnancy (aOR = 1.49, 95% CI: 1.03-2.16), high knowledge score on COVID-19 (aOR = 1.05, 95% CI: 1.01-1.10), high level of perceived susceptibility (aOR = 2.18, 95% CI: 1.36-3.49), low level of perceived barriers (aOR = 4.76, 95% CI: 2.23-10.18), high level of perceived benefit (aOR = 2.18, 95% CI: 1.36-3.49), and high level of perceived cues to action (aOR = 15.70, 95% CI: 8.28-29.80).Conclusions: About one quarters of pregnant women have vaccine hesitancy.

We aimed to examine the association of maternal diet quality, as indicated by the Healthy Eating Index-2010 (HEI), in pregnancy with offspring metabolic biomarkers and body composition at age 4-7 years. METHODS We used data from 761 mother-offspring pairs from the Healthy Start study to examine sex-specific associations of HEI >57 vs ≤57 with offspring fasting glucose, leptin, cholesterol, HDL, LDL, percentage fat mass, BMI z score and log-transformed insulin, 1/insulin, HOMA-IR, adiponectin, triacylglycerols, triacylglycerols:HDL, fat mass, and sum of skinfolds. Multivariable linear regression models accounted for maternal race/ethnicity, age, education, smoking habits during pregnancy and physical activity, and child's age. RESULTS During pregnancy, mean (SD) HEI score was 55.0 (13.3), and 43.0% had an HEI score >57. Among boys, there was an inverse association of maternal HEI with offspring glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR and adiponectin. For instance, maternal HEI >57 was associated with lower fasting glucose (-0.11; 95% CI -0.20, -0.02 mmol/l), and lower concentrations of: insulin by 15.3% (95% CI -24.6, -5.0), HOMA-IR by 16.3% (95% CI -25.7, -5.6) and adiponectin by 9.3% (95% CI -16.1, -2.0). Among girls, there was an inverse association of maternal HEI with insulin and a positive association with LDL. However, following covariate adjustment, all estimates among girls were attenuated to the null. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION Greater compliance with the USA Dietary Guidelines via the HEI may improve the maternal-fetal milieu and decrease susceptibility for poor metabolic health among offspring, particularly boys.

In the absence of cell lines recapitulating this phenotype in vitro, we developed an ex vivo experimental system, based on the intraluminal microinjection of Listeria in untreated, pharmacologically treated, and genetically modified intestinal organoids. Using both live light-sheet microscopy and confocal imaging, we show that Listeria translocates through goblet cells within a membrane vacuole in an InlA- and microtubule-dependent manner. As Ecad undergoes constant apical-basal recycling,7,8 we hypothesized that Lm may transit through goblet cells by hijacking Ecad recycling pathway. Indeed, Listeria is stuck at goblet cell apex when Ecad endocytosis is blocked and remains trapped intracellularly at the basolateral pole of goblet cells when Rab11-dependent Ecad recycling is compromised. Together, these results show that Listeria, upon docking onto its luminally accessible receptor Ecad, hijacks its recycling pathway to be transferred by transcytosis across goblet cells. Live imaging of host-pathogen interactions in organoids is a promising approach to dissect their underlying cell and molecular biology.","Kim, Minhee; Fevre, Cindy; Lavina, Morgane; Disson, Olivier; Lecuit, Marc",Current biology : CB,350,33

The proximal retrieval feature of the Micra™ can be snared and the device is then retracted from the myocardium, pulling the device through the tricuspid valve. This study characterizes the potential risks of Micra™ nitinol tine engagement with the tricuspid sub-valvular apparatus. METHODS Fresh human hearts nonviable for transplant (n = 10) were obtained from our regional organ procurement agency (LifeSource, Minneapolis, MN, USA). Micra™ fixation tines were affixed to a linear force transducer. Tines were then engaged in tricuspid chordae tendineae to conduct a constant velocity tensile test. Each test was run until tines disengaged from the chordae tendineae or until they released from the valve apparatus. Subsequently, biomechanical failure properties of the valve apparatus and isolated chordae tendineae were determined using a series of uniaxial tensile tests. RESULTS There were no chordal ruptures observed during our Micra™ tine extraction testing. Chordal failure required 15.0 times the force of extracting a single engaged tine, and 9.0 times the force of extracting two engaged tines. The uniaxial stresses required for isolated chordal failure averaged 17.4 N/mm2 ; failure strains exceeded 150% resting chordal length. CONCLUSIONS The forces required to rupture tricuspid chordae tendineae significantly exceeded the forces potentially imposed on the chordae during Micra™ device retrievals. We conclude that the fixation tines of the Micra™ device are unlikely to damage the tricuspid apparatus during either implant or retrieval.","Mattson, Alexander R; Zhingre Sanchez, Jorge D; Iaizzo, Paul A",Pacing and clinical electrophysiology : PACE,350,19

DESIGN Retrospective cohort. METHODS Using data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project California State Inpatient Database, 2005-2011, we identified 2,752,639 transfers. We then constructed a series of networks detailing the connections formed by hospitals. We computed 2 measures of connectivity, indegree and weighted indegree, measuring the number of hospitals from which transfers into a hospital arrive, and the total number of incoming transfers, respectively. Next, we estimated a multivariate model of C. difficile infection cases using the log-transformed network measures as well as covariates for hospital fixed effects, log median length of stay, log fraction of patients aged 65 or older, and quarter and year indicators as predictors. RESULTS We found an increase of 1 in the log indegree was associated with a 4.8% increase in incidence of C. difficile infection (95% CI, 2.3%-7.4%) and an increase of 1 in log weighted indegree was associated with a 3.3% increase in C. difficile infection incidence (1.5%-5.2%). Moreover, including measures of connectivity in our models greatly improved their fit. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest infection control is not under the exclusive control of a given hospital but is also influenced by the connections and number of connections that hospitals have with other hospitals.","Simmering, Jacob E; Polgreen, Linnea A; Campbell, David R; Cavanaugh, Joseph E; Polgreen, Philip M",Infection control and hospital epidemiology,350,24

The precise impact of these factors has not been well studied. In a porcine model, we used computed tomographic (CT) scanning for measuring working space volume and distances. In a first series of experiments, we studied the relationship between intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) and working space. METHODS Eleven 20 kg pigs were studied under standardized anesthesia and volume-controlled ventilation. Cardiorespiratory parameters were monitored continuously, and blood gas samples were taken at different IAP levels. Respiratory rate was increased when ETCO₂ exceeded 7 kPa. Breath-hold CT scans were made at IAP levels of 0, 5, 10, and 15 mmHg. Insufflator volumes were compared to CT-measured volumes. Maximum dimensions of pneumoperitoneum were measured on reconstructed CT images. RESULTS Respiratory rate had to be increased in three animals. Mild hypercapnia and acidosis occurred at 15 mmHg IAP. Peak inspiratory pressure rose significantly at 10 and 15 mmHg. CT-measured volume increased relatively by 93 % from 5 to 10 mmHg IAP and by 19 % from 10 to 15 mmHg IAP. Comparing CT volumes to insufflator volumes gave a bias of 76 mL. The limits of agreement were -0.31 to +0.47, a range of 790 mL. The internal anteroposterior diameter increased by 18 % by increasing IAP from 5 to 10 mmHg and by 5 % by increasing IAP from 10 to 15 mmHg. At 15 mmHg, the total relative increase of the pubis-diaphragm distance was only 6 %. Abdominal width did not increase. CONCLUSIONS CT allows for precise calculation of the actual CO₂ pneumoperitoneum volume, whereas the volume of CO₂ released by the insufflator does not. Increasing IAP up to 10 mmHg achieved most gain in volume and in internal anteroposterior diameter. At an IAP of 10 mmHg, higher peak inspiratory pressure was significantly elevated.","Vlot, John; Wijnen, Rene; Stolker, Robert Jan; Bax, Klaas",Surgical endoscopy,350,28

With new chemotherapy and target therapy options, it becomes more difficult to decide between hospice care and aggressive management. It is also crucial to consider the cost increases leading to severe financial burdens on healthcare systems. To better understand treatment options at the individual level, this study set out to describe trends in end-of-life care for the four leading cancers in women in Taiwan. STUDY DESIGN This was a population-based retrospective cohort study. METHODS The data source was obtained between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2013, from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. We identified 98,575 women with a diagnosis of breast (18,596), colorectal (23,734), liver and biliary (28,795) or lung (27,450) cancer who had died during the study period. Hospital data for services provided in the last 6 months of life, including hospice services and aggressive managements (chemotherapy, frequent hospitalisation, emergency room [ER] visits, intensive care unit [ICU] admission and endotracheal intubation), were collected. RESULTS Hospice utilisation increased over the study period, with 25.85%, 25.34%, 21.23% and 26.55% of female patients with breast, colorectal, liver and biliary, and lung cancer receiving hospice care, respectively. However, the number of women undergoing aggressive treatments in the last 6 months of life remained high, with the breast cancer group having the highest chemotherapy rate, the colorectal cancer group having frequent hospitalisation and the liver and biliary cancer group having frequent ER visits and ICU admissions. CONCLUSIONS Increasing hospice utilisation among women with the four most common cancers in Taiwan indicates that hospice services have gradually become well accepted over the past 13 years; however, the real focus is on the ineffective treatment preceding hospice care, and late referral was also a notable problem.","Pan, H-J; Chang, H-T; Huang, W-C; Lin, H-C",Public health,350,22

While the former direct-to-consumer practice is usually considered rogue and should be legally constrained, regulated clinical trials could also be ethically questionable. Here, we outline principal objections against these trials as they are currently conducted. Notably, these often lack a clear rationale for how transplanted cells may confer a therapeutic benefit in ASD, and thus, have ill-defined therapeutic outcomes. We posit that ambiguous and unsubstantiated descriptions of outcome from such clinical trials may nonetheless appeal to the lay public as being based on authentic scientific findings. These may further fuel caregivers of patients with ASD to pursue unregulated direct-to-consumer treatments, thus exposing them to unnecessary risks. There is, therefore, a moral obligation on the part of those regulating and conducting clinical trials of stem cell-based therapeutic for ASD minors to incorporate clear therapeutic targets, scientific rigour and reporting accuracy in their work. Any further stem cell-based trials for ASD unsupported by significant preclinical advances and particularly sound scientific hypothesis and aims would be ethically indefensible.","Yeo-Teh, Nicole Shu Ling; Tang, Bor Luen",Journal of medical ethics,350,1

We aimed to investigate the clinical and radiological outcomes of endovascular coiling of M1 segment aneurysms. METHODS Between January 2003 and December 2014, we retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 52 patients (52 aneurysms) from four institutions who underwent endovascular coiling of M1 segment aneurysms. Patients who underwent clinical and radiologic follow-up for more than a year after the procedure were evaluated. RESULTS The aneurysms were located in the early frontal branch, early temporal branch, and lenticulostriate artery in 28, 15, and nine patients, respectively. Endovascular coiling was achieved in 51 cases and failed in one case. Of these 51 cases, 46 (90.2%) and five (9.8%) were non-ruptured and ruptured aneurysms, respectively. Initial angiographic results revealed complete occlusion in 26 (51.0%), residual neck in 16 (31.4%), and residual sac in nine (17.6%) cases. One failed case had a symptomatic procedural complication of thromboembolism. However, there was no permanent morbidity or mortality. Two major recanalization cases (3.9%) were retreated by endovascular coiling. On multivariable logistic regression analysis, aneurysmal recurrence was significantly related to aneurysm height (OR, 1.887; 95% CI, 1.107 to 3.217; p = 0.020), width (OR, 1.836; CI, 1.127 to 2.992; p = 0.015), and neck (OR, 4.017; CI, 1.220 to 13.232, p = 0.022). CONCLUSION Endovascular coiling of M1 segment aneurysms appeared to be a feasible treatment option with a relatively low-retreatment rate. Aneurysm size was statistically significantly associated with recurrence.","Baek, Jin Wook; Huh, Chae Wook; Heo, Young Jin; Yoo, Min Wook; Kwon, Soon Chan; Kwon, O Ki; Jeong, Hae Woong; Kim, Sung Tae; Jin, Sung-Chul",Acta neurochirurgica,350,1

We emphasize that considering and addressing all these factors is a conditio sine qua non for appropriate treatment of these conditions. First, we provide an overview of what is currently known about how each of these factors - the environment, including the influence of those in an individual's family, the individual's own psychological states and traits, and the individual's (neuro)physiological make-up - interact to ultimately result in the generation of FGID symptoms. Second, we provide an overview of commonly used assessment tools which can assist clinicians in obtaining a more comprehensive assessment of these factors in their patients. Finally, the broader perspective outlined earlier is applied to provide an overview of centrally acting treatment strategies, both psychological and pharmacological, which have been shown to be efficacious to treat FGID.","Van Oudenhove, Lukas; Crowell, Michael D; Drossman, Douglas A; Halpert, Albena D; Keefer, Laurie; Lackner, Jeffrey M; Murphy, Tasha B; Naliboff, Bruce D; Levy, Rona L",Gastroenterology,350,1

It is unclear whether similar effects exist in humans and which bioactive compounds are present. This review synthesises the evidence on the world's most commonly consumed mushroom, Agaricus bisporus to (i) examine its effect on human health outcomes; and (ii) determine the nutrient density of its bioactive compounds, which may explain their health effects. A systematic literature search was conducted on the consumption of A. bisporus, without date and study design limits. Bioactive compounds included ergosterol, ergothioneine, flavonoids, glucans and chitin. Two authors independently identified studies for inclusion and assessed methodological quality. Beneficial effects of A. bisporus on metabolic syndrome, immune function, gastrointestinal health and cancer, with the strongest evidence for the improvement in Vitamin D status in humans, were found. Ultraviolet B (UVB) exposed mushrooms may increase and maintain serum 25(OH)D levels to a similar degree as vitamin D supplements. A. bisporus contain beta-glucans, ergosterol, ergothioneine, vitamin D and an antioxidant compound usually reported as flavonoids; with varying concentrations depending on the type of mushroom, cooking method and duration, and UVB exposure. Further research is required to fully elucidate the bioactive compounds in mushrooms using vigorous analytical methods and expand the immunological markers being tested. To enable findings to be adopted into clinical practice and public health initiatives, replication of existing studies in different population groups is required to confirm the impact of A. bisporus on human health.","Blumfield, Michelle; Abbott, Kylie; Duve, Emily; Cassettari, Tim; Marshall, Skye; Fayet-Moore, Flavia",The Journal of nutritional biochemistry,350,25

The ACE1 D allele is associated with higher ACE1 concentrations in tissues. Previous research has shown that susceptibility to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is primarily determined by the affinity between the viral receptor-binding domain and the host human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor. In the human genome, ACE2 is identified as a homolog to ACE1. Objective: The purpose of this study was to characterize the ACE1 D allele distribution in Bosnia and Herzegovina (B&H), so as to compare it to population data from other European countries and to investigate the potential correlation between D allele frequencies and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemiological findings in selected European populations. Methods: The ACE1 D allele frequencies in 18 selected European populations were analyzed and compared with COVID-19 prevalence, mortality, and severity using multivariate linear regression analysis. Results and Discussion: The ACE1 D allele distribution within the B&H population was similar to its distribution in other European populations. Regression analysis showed no significant correlation between the D allele frequency and the incidence of infections between the examined populations, nor with the rates of fatality and severe cases. Conclusion: There is no clear statistical evidence that the ACE1 D allele is associated with increased or decreased COVID-19 incidence, mortality, and case severity within the investigated populations.","Cenanovic, Merisa; Dogan, Serkan; Asic, Adna; Besic, Larisa; Marjanovic, Damir",Genetic testing and molecular biomarkers,350,29

Even though the disease is often portrayed by its most apparent clinical features, given the abundance of GH receptors throughout the body, it truly is a systemic disease leading to numerous complications and comorbidities. A distinct medical issue in the context of acromegaly is diabetes: It can be a complication as a consequence of GH excess and its mediators, but it can also result from treatment of acromegaly. AREAS COVERED This review provides an overview of the effects of acromegaly pathophysiology on glucose homeostasis. Furthermore, it devotes an extensive section on the influence that acromegaly treatment has on glucose metabolism, including approved as well as currently investigated drugs. It also summarizes observations from the use of anti-diabetic medication in patients with acromegaly. EXPERT OPINION Glucose imbalance is an important aspect of acromegaly comorbidity and deserves more attention. Even though numerous studies have investigated glucose homeostasis in acromegaly, there is still a clear need for more basic, translational, and also clinical research to advance the understanding of the underlying mechanisms and how to best address them.","Störmann, Sylvère; Schopohl, Jochen",Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,350,16

We aimed to develop a new pharmacokinetic model of propofol in underweight patients. METHODS Twenty underweight (BMI<18.5 kg m-2) patients aged 20-68 yr were given an i.v. bolus of propofol (2 mg kg-1) for induction of anaesthesia. Anaesthesia was maintained with a zero-order infusion (8 mg kg-1 h-1) of propofol and target-controlled infusion of remifentanil. Arterial blood was sampled at preset intervals. A population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using non-linear mixed effects modelling. The time to peak effect (tpeak, maximally reduced bispectral index) was measured in 28 additional underweight patients receiving propofol 2 mg kg-1. RESULTS In total, 455 plasma concentration measurements from the 20 patients were used to characterise the pharmacokinetics of propofol. A three-compartment mammillary model well described the propofol concentration time course. BMI and lean body mass (LBM) calculated using the Janmahasatian formula were significant covariates for the rapid peripheral volume of distribution and for the clearance of the final pharmacokinetic model of propofol, respectively. The parameter estimates were as follows: V1(L)=2.02, V2(L)=12.9(BMI/18.5), V3(L)=139, Cl (L⋅min-1)=1.66(LBM/40), Q1 (L⋅min-1)=1.44, Q2 (L⋅min-1)=0.87+0.0189×(LBM-40). The median tpeak of propofol was 1.32 min (n=48).

Nascent DNA at the regressed arms of these reversed forks is protected by RAD51 and the tumor suppressors BRCA1/2, and when this function is compromised, stalled forks undergo pathological MRE11-dependent degradation, leading to chromosomal instability. However, the mechanisms regulating MRE11 functions at reversed forks are currently unclear. Here, we identify the MRE11-binding protein MRNIP as a novel fork protection factor that directly binds to MRE11 and specifically represses its exonuclease activity. The loss of MRNIP results in impaired replication fork progression, MRE11 exonuclease-dependent degradation of reversed forks, persistence of underreplicated genomic regions, chemosensitivity, and chromosome instability. Our findings identify MRNIP as a novel regulator of MRE11 at reversed forks and provide evidence that regulation of specific MRE11 nuclease activities ensures protection of nascent DNA and thereby genome integrity.","Bennett, L G; Wilkie, A M; Antonopoulou, E; Ceppi, I; Sanchez, A; Vernon, E G; Gamble, A; Myers, K N; Collis, S J; Cejka, P; Staples, C J",Science advances,350,5

METHODS After PSM, 466 pairs of patients (A group, on-pump; B group, off-pump) who were aged≥70 years undergoing first isolated CABG surgery from January 2012 to December 2016 entered the study. AKI was defined and classified according to the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria. The incidence and severity of in-hospital AKI were compared. The impacts of AKI on the long-term outcomes including new onset of dialysis and mortality were analyzed. RESULTS The two PSM groups had similar baseline and procedure except whether the CPB was used or not. In hospital and 30-day mortality was of no difference(χ2 = 0.051, p = 0.821). AKI of any severity occurred in 40.3% of all patients, with stage 1 accounting for most cases. No difference regarding the incidence and severity of AKI could be found: AKIN stage 1: 139 (29.8%) vs 131 (28.1%); AKIN stage 2: 40 (8.6%) vs 35 (7.5%); AKIN stage 3: 18 (3.9%) vs 13 (2.8%), (u = 0.543, p = 0.532). No difference was observed in the in-hospital new onset of dialysis (χ2 = 0.312, P = 0.576). The use of CPB was not found to influence long-term new onset of dialysis (χ2 = 0.14, p = 0.708) and mortality (χ2 = 0.099, p = 0.753). Comparing with non-AKI patients, AKI patients were associated with an increased rates of new onset of dialysis (χ2 = 8.153, p = 0.004) and mortality (χ2 = 6.277, p = 0.012) during the follow-up. Multivariable logistic regression manifested that the HR for long-term new onset of dialysis and mortality in AKI patients vs. non-AKI patients was 1.83 and 1.31 respectively (95%CI 1.12-2.86, p = 0.007; 95%CI 1.17-2.58, p = 0.015).

CONCLUSIONS For elderly CABG patients, AKI was common, but deterioration of dialysis was a seldom incidence. Comparing with on-pump, off-pump did not decrease the rates or severity of AKI, long-term new onset of dialysis or mortality. AKI was associated with an increased long-term new onset of dialysis and decreased long-term survival.","Wang, Rui; Wang, Xian; Zhu, Yifan; Chen, Wen; Li, Liangpeng; Chen, Xin",Journal of cardiothoracic surgery,350,16

METHODS Data were obtained from three waves of an online, repeated cross-sectional survey of adults residing in Canada (May 08-June 23, 2020; N = 3012). Trends were assessed using Cochran-Armitage and chi-square tests, and risk characteristics were identified using logistic regression analyses. RESULTS Cannabis use in the overall population remained stable during the months of May and June. Among those who used cannabis, about half increased their cannabis use compared to before the start of the pandemic. This proportion of an increase in cannabis use among those who used cannabis remained consistent across the survey waves. Risk characteristics associated with higher odds of an increase in cannabis use included residence in the central region (Odds ratio, 95% confidence intervals: 1.93, 1.03-3.62), being 18 to 29 years old (2.61, 1.32-5.17) or 30 to 49 years old (1.85, 1.07-3.19), having less than college or university education (1.86, 1.13-3.06) and being somewhat worried about the pandemic's impact on personal finances (1.73, 1.00-3.00). CONCLUSIONS A large proportion of those who used cannabis have increased cannabis use during the pandemic, suggesting a need for interventions to limit increased cannabis use, policy measures to address cannabis-attributable harms, and continued monitoring of cannabis use during and after the pandemic.","Imtiaz, Sameer; Wells, Samantha; Rehm, Jürgen; Hamilton, Hayley A; Nigatu, Yeshambel T; Wickens, Christine M; Jankowicz, Damian; Elton-Marshall, Tara",Journal of addiction medicine,350,12

Patients with small hemangiomas (< 7 cm) required a significantly shorter operating time (71.1 ± 20.18 min vs. 106 ± 23.55 min, p = 0.000) and fewer punctures compared with patients with large hemangiomas (> 7 cm) (4.61 ± 1.09 vs. 6.73 ±1.01, P < 0.05). According to the Dindo-Clavien classification, 15 patients experienced 34 Grade 1 complications, and two had complications of Grade 3a. All complications were resolved by conservative treatment. Forty-three (86.0%) HHs in 38 patients were completely ablated after RFA, and 7 (14.0%) HHs in 6 patients were incompletely ablated. All patients were followed up for 6-24 months (mean 15 ± 6 months). CONCLUSION The data showed that laparoscopic RFA is an effective treatment for small (< 10 cm) HHs. While the incidence of postoperative complications remains high, the majority of complications are minor. Patients undergoing laparoscopic RFA for HHs, even for the small ones, should be carefully selected.","Wen, Shun-Qian; Wan, Ming; Len, Kai-Ming; Hu, Qiu-Hui; Xie, Xue-Yi; Wu, Qing; Liao, Guan-Qun",Annals of hepatology,350,1

This study aimed to investigate whether high dose XR effectively attenuates post-operative hypersensitivity better than low dose XR in a mouse model of incisional pain. Methods Mice (n = 44) were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups: (a) saline (1 ml/kg SC, once); (b) sustained release buprenorphine (Bup-SR, 1 mg/kg SC, once); (c) low dose extended-release buprenorphine (XR-lo, 3.25 mg/kg SC, once); (d) high dose extended-release buprenorphine (XR-hi, 6.5 mg/kg SC, once). On days -1, 0 (4 hours), 1, 2, and 3, mechanical and thermal hypersensitivities were evaluated, and plasma buprenorphine concentrations were measured. Results Mechanical (days 0-2) and thermal (days 0-1) hypersensitivities were observed in the saline group. Bup-SR, XR-lo, and XR-hi attenuated mechanical hypersensitivity on days 0, 1, and 2. None of the treatment groups, except XR-Lo on day 0, attenuated thermal hypersensitivity on days 0 or 1. Plasma buprenorphine concentration peaked at 4 hours (day 0) in all treatment groups and remained greater than 1 ng/mL on days 0-2. No abnormal clinical observations or gross pathologic findings were seen in any groups. Conclusion The results indicate XR-hi did not effectively attenuate post-operative hypersensitivity better than XR-lo. Thus both 3.25 and 6.5 mg/kg XR are recommended for attenuating post-operative hypersensitivity for at least up to 48 hours in mice.","Navarro, Kaela; Jampachaisri, Katechan; Huss, Monika; Pacharinsak, Cholawat",Animal models and experimental medicine,350,0

They are so long that others in the operating room (OR) generally have exhausted whatever activities can be done. They cause delays in the starts of surgeons' to-follow cases and are associated with longer duration workdays. Anesthesiologists rate them as being inferior quality. We compare prolonged times to extubation between a teaching hospital in the United States with a phase I postanesthesia care unit (PACU) and a teaching hospital in Japan without a PACU. Our report is especially important during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Anesthesiologists with some patients undergoing general anesthetics and having initial PACU recovery in the ORs where they had surgery can learn from the Japanese anesthesiologists with all patients recovering in ORs. METHODS The historical cohort study included all patients undergoing gynecological surgery at a US hospital (N = 785) or Japanese hospital (N = 699), with the time from OR entrance to end of surgery of at least 4 hours. RESULTS The mean times from end of surgery to OR exit were slightly longer at the US hospital than at the Japanese hospital (mean difference 1.9 minutes, P < .0001). The mean from end of surgery to discharge to surgical ward at the US hospital also was longer (P < .0001), mean difference 2.2 hours. The sample standard deviations of times from end of surgery until tracheal extubation was 40 minutes for the US hospital versus 4 minutes at the Japanese hospital (P < .0001). Prolonged times to tracheal extubation were 39% of cases at the US hospital versus 6% at the Japanese hospital; relative risk 6.40, 99% confidence interval (CI), 4.28-9.56. Neither patient demographics, case characteristics, surgeon, anesthesiologist, nor anesthesia provider significantly revised the risk ratio. There were 39% of times to extubation that were prolonged among the patients receiving neither remifentanil nor desflurane (all such patients at the US hospital) versus 6% among the patients receiving both remifentanil and desflurane (all at the Japanese hospital). The relative risk 7.12 (99% CI, 4.59-11.05) was similar to that for the hospital groups. CONCLUSIONS Differences in anesthetic practice can facilitate major differences in patient recovery soon after anesthesia, useful when the patient will recover initially in the OR or if the phase I PACU is expected to be unable to admit the patient.","Sugiyama, Daisuke; Dexter, Franklin; Thenuwara, Kokila; Ueda, Kenichi",Anesthesia and analgesia,350,1

The aim of this study was to investigate the transcriptional, functional, and morphological effects on renal tissue after 177Lu-octreotate administration in normal mice, and to identify biomarkers for radiation induced renal toxicity. METHODS C57BL/6N mice were i.v. injected with 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, or 150 MBq 177Lu-octreotate (0, 16, 29, 40, 48, and 54 Gy to the kidneys). At 4, 8, and 12 months after administration, radiation-induced effects were evaluated in relation to (a) global transcriptional variations in kidney tissues, (b) morphological changes in the kidneys, (c) changes in white and red blood cell count as well as blood levels of urea, and (d) changes in renal function using 99mTc-DTPA/99mTc-DMSA scintigraphy. RESULTS In general, the highest number of differentially regulated transcripts was observed at 12 months after administration. The Cdkn1a, C3, Dbp, Lcn2, and Per2 genes displayed a distinct dose-dependent regulation, with increased expression level with increasing absorbed dose. Ifng, Tnf, and Il1B were identified as primary up-stream regulators of the recurrently regulated transcripts. Furthermore, previously proposed biomarkers for kidney injury and radiation damage were also observed. The functional investigation revealed reduced excretion of 99mTc-DTPA after 150 MBq, an increased uptake of 99mTc-DMSA at all dose levels compared with the controls, and markedly increased urea level in blood after 150 MBq at 12 months. CONCLUSION Distinct dose-response relationships were found for several of the regulated transcripts. The Cdkn1a, Dbp, Lcn2, and Per2 genes are proposed as biomarkers for 177Lu-octreotate exposure of kidney. Correlations to functional and morphological effects further confirm applicability of these genes as markers of radiation damage in kidney tissue.","Schüler, Emil; Larsson, Maria; Parris, Toshima Z; Johansson, Martin E; Helou, Khalil; Forssell-Aronsson, Eva",PloS one,350,1

In this study, we investigated whether the enzyme is involved in the regulation of the STING pathway, which is the main signaling activated in the presence of both self- and pathogen DNA in the cytoplasm, leading to type I IFN (IFN I) production. In this study, we demonstrated that TG2 negatively regulates STING signaling by impairing IRF3 phosphorylation in bone marrow-derived macrophages, isolated from wild-type and TG2 knockout mice. In the absence of TG2, we found an increase in the IFN-β production and in the downstream JAK/STAT pathway activation. Interestingly, proteomic analysis revealed that TG2 interacts with TBK1, affecting its interactome composition. Indeed, TG2 ablation facilitates the TBK1-IRF3 interaction, thus indicating that the enzyme plays a negative regulatory effect on IRF3 recruitment in the STING/TBK1 complex. In keeping with these findings, we observed an increase in the IFNβ production in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from COVID-19-positive dead patients paralleled by a dramatic decrease of the TG2 expression in the lung pneumocytes. Taken together, these results suggest that TG2 plays a negative regulation on the IFN-β production associated with the innate immunity response to the cytosolic presence of both self- and pathogen DNA.","Occhigrossi, Luca; Rossin, Federica; D'Eletto, Manuela; Farrace, Maria Grazia; Ciccosanti, Fabiola; Petrone, Linda; Sacchi, Alessandra; Nardacci, Roberta; Falasca, Laura; Del Nonno, Franca; Palucci, Ivana; Smirnov, Evgeni; Barlev, Nick; Agrati, Chiara; Goletti, Delia; Delogu, Giovanni; Fimia, Gian Maria; Piacentini, Mauro",Journal of immunology,350,7

Guidelines endorse the integration of psychological interventions in the management of chronic LBP. However, uncertainty surrounds the comparative effectiveness of different psychological approaches. Network meta-analysis (NMA) allows comparison and ranking of numerous competing interventions for a given outcome of interest. Therefore, we will perform a systematic review with a NMA to determine which type of psychological intervention is most effective for adults with chronic non-specific LBP. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will search electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, SCOPUS and CINAHL) from inception until 22 August 2019 for randomised controlled trials comparing psychological interventions to any comparison interventions in adults with chronic non-specific LBP. There will be no restriction on language. The primary outcomes will include physical function and pain intensity, and secondary outcomes will include health-related quality of life, fear avoidance, intervention compliance and safety. Risk of bias will be assessed using the Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomised trials (RoB 2) tool and confidence in the evidence will be assessed using the Confidence in NMA (CINeMA) framework. We will conduct a random-effects NMA using a frequentist approach to estimate relative effects for all comparisons between treatments and rank treatments according to the mean rank and surface under the cumulative ranking curve values.

For this purpose, we focused on two of the most notable neurophysiological effects of MI – the event-related-desynchronization (ERD) level and the increase in cortical excitability assessed with navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS). For TMS navigation, we used individual high-resolution 3D brain MRIs. Ten BCI-naive and healthy adults participated in this study. The MI (rest or left/right hand imagery using Graz-BCI paradigm) tasks were performed separately in the presence and absence of feedback. To investigate how much the presence/absence of vibrotactile feedback in MI BCI-based training could contribute to the sensorimotor cortical activations, we compared the MEPs amplitude during MI after training with and without feedback. In addition, the ERD levels during MI BCI-based training were investigated. Our findings provide evidence that applying vibrotactile feedback during MI training leads to (i) an enhancement of the desynchronization level of mu-rhythm EEG patterns over the contralateral motor cortex area corresponding to the MI of the non-dominant hand; (ii) an increase in motor cortical excitability in hand muscle representation corresponding to a muscle engaged by the MI.","Grigorev, N.; Savosenkov, A.; Lukoyanov, M.; Udoratina, A.; Shusharina, N.; Kaplan, A.; Hramov, A.; Kazantsev, V.; Gordleeva, S.",bioRxiv,350,7

Especially, deep neural network (DNN) methods have significantly reduced estimation errors for crowd counting missions. Recent studies have demonstrated that DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, i.e., normal images with human-imperceptible perturbations could mislead DNNs to make false predictions. In this work, we propose a robust attack strategy called Adversarial Patch Attack with Momentum (APAM) to systematically evaluate the robustness of crowd counting models, where the attacker's goal is to create an adversarial perturbation that severely degrades their performances, thus leading to public safety accidents (e.g., stampede accidents). Especially, the proposed attack leverages the extreme-density background information of input images to generate robust adversarial patches via a series of transformations (e.g., interpolation, rotation, etc.). We observe that by perturbing less than 6\% of image pixels, our attacks severely degrade the performance of crowd counting systems, both digitally and physically. To better enhance the adversarial robustness of crowd counting models, we propose the first regression model-based Randomized Ablation (RA), which is more sufficient than Adversarial Training (ADT) (Mean Absolute Error of RA is 5 lower than ADT on clean samples and 30 lower than ADT on adversarial examples). Extensive experiments on five crowd counting models demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed method.

However, little is known about regulation of the membrane-bound protein import machinery. Here, we report that Pex14, a central component of the protein translocation complex in peroxisomal membrane, is phosphorylated in response to oxidative stresses such as H2O2 in mammalian cells. H2O2-induced phosphorylation of Pex14 at Ser232 suppresses peroxisomal import of catalase in vivo and selectively decreases formation of PTS1 receptor Pex5-mediated ternary complex of Pex14 with catalase in vitro. Phosphomimetic Pex14-S232D mutant elevates the level of cytosolic catalase, but not canonical PTS1-proteins, conferring higher cell resistance to H2O2. We thus suggest that H2O2-induced phosphorylation of Pex14 spatiotemporally regulates peroxisomal import of catalase, functioning in counteracting action against oxidative stress by the increase of cytosolic catalase.","Okumoto, Kanji; El Shermely, Mahmoud; Natsui, Masanao; Kosako, Hidetaka; Natsuyama, Ryuichi; Marutani, Toshihiro; Fujiki, Yukio",bioRxiv,350,1

This study aims to investigate the impact of the pandemic on population birth outcomes in Wales, rates of primary immunisations and examine expectant mothers experiences of pregnancy including self reported levels of stress and anxiety. Methods: Population level birth outcomes in Wales: Stillbirths, prematurity, birth weight and Caesarean section births before (2016 to 2019) and during (2020) the pandemic were compared using national level routine anonymised data held in the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank. The first three scheduled primary immunisations were compared between 2019 and 2020. Self reported pregnancy experience: 215 expectant mothers (aged 16+) in Wales completed an online survey about their experiences of pregnancy during the pandemic. The qualitative survey data was analysed using codebook thematic analysis. Findings: There was no significant difference between annual outcomes including gestation and birth weight, stillbirths, and Caesarean sections for infants born in 2020 compared to years 2016 to 2019. There was an increase in late term births (>42 weeks gestation) during the first lockdown (OR: 1.28, p=0.019) and a decrease in moderate to late preterm births (32 to 36 weeks gestation) during the second lockdown (OR: 0.74, p=0.001).

The pandemic has spread worldwide through human interactions. Since the nature of the disease differs everywhere and it has a stochastic effect, we therefore develop a stochastic mathematical model to investigate its temporal dynamics. Asymptomatic individuals have a major effect on the spreading dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 virus therefore, we divide the total population into susceptible, asymptomatic, symptomatic, and recovered groups. Multiple vaccinations have commenced across the globe. In this study, we assume that the vaccine confers permanent immunity. Moreover, due to the unpredictable characteristics of the disease random fluctuations are assumed in every population group. Using this model we show the existence and uniqueness of positive solutions to the proposed problem. We also discuss the disease extinction and persistence in the model to depict how contagious diseases can be eliminated from the community. We use the real data of SARS-CoV-2 virus, reported in Oman from the 1st January 2021 to 23rd May 2021 to parameterize the model. We then perform large-scale computational analysis to show the numerical simulation and verify the analytical findings.","Khan, T.; Ullah, R.; Zaman, G.; El Khatib, Y.",Physica Scripta,350,1

Changes in the efficiency of ribosomal frameshifting can have major effects on the ability of cells to propagate viruses which use this mechanism. Furthermore, studies of this process can illuminate the mechanisms involved in the maintenance of the normal translation reading frame. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae killer virus system uses programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting to synthesize its gene products. Strains harboring the mof2-1 allele demonstrated a fivefold increase in frameshifting and prevented killer virus propagation. In this report, we present the results of the cloning and characterization of the wild-type MOF2 gene. mof2-1 is a novel allele of SUI1, a gene previously shown to play a role in translation initiation start site selection. Strains harboring the mof2-1 allele demonstrated a mutant start site selection phenotype and increased efficiency of programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting and conferred paromomycin sensitivity. The increased frameshifting observed in vivo was reproduced in extracts prepared from mof2-1 cells. Addition of purified wild-type Mof2p/Sui1p reduced frameshifting efficiencies to wild-type levels. Expression of the human SUI1 homolog in yeast corrects all of the mof2-1 phenotypes, demonstrating that the function of this protein is conserved throughout evolution. Taken together, these results suggest that Mof2p/Sui1p functions as a general modulator of accuracy at both the initiation and elongation phases of translation.","Cui, Y; Dinman, J D; Kinzy, T G; Peltz, S W",Molecular and cellular biology,350,16

METHODS Middle ear fluids (MEF) collected by tympanocentesis and nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) at the time of the AOM diagnosis were examined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for HRV, RSV, and HCV RNA. PATIENTS Ninety-two children aged 3 months to 7 years during a 1-year period. RESULTS Virus RNA was detected in a total of 69 children (75%) and in 44 MEF samples (48%) and 57 NPA samples (62%) at the time of AOM diagnosis. HRV RNA was detected in both MEF and NPA in 18 (20%), in MEF alone in 4 (4%), and in NPA alone in 10 (11%). RSV was detected in both MEF and NPA in 12 (13%), in MEF alone in 5 (5%), and in NPA alone in 9 (10%). HCV RNA was detected in both MEF and NPA in 5 (5%), in MEF alone in 2 (2%), and in NPA alone in 9 (10%). Dual viral infections were detected in 5% of children. HRV and RSV were detected simultaneously in 2 MEF samples and in 2 NPA samples; RSV and HCV were detected in 1 NPA sample. Bacterial pathogens were detected in 56 (62%) MEF from 91 children. Viral RNA was detected in 20 (57%) MEF of 35 bacteria-negative and in 25 (45%) of 56 bacteria-positive MEF samples. No important differences in the risk of treatment failure, relapse, or occurrence of late secretory otitis media were noted between children with virus-positive and virus-negative MEF aspirates. CONCLUSION These findings highlight the importance of common respiratory viruses, particularly HRV and RSV, in predisposing to and causing AOM in young children.","Pitkäranta, A; Virolainen, A; Jero, J; Arruda, E; Hayden, F G",Pediatrics,350,20

To explore the genomic signatures, we comprehensively analyzed 2,492 complete and/or near-complete genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 strains reported from across the globe to the GISAID database up to 30 March 2020. Genome-wide annotations revealed 1,516 nucleotide-level variations at different positions throughout the entire genome of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, nucleotide (nt) deletion analysis found twelve deletion sites throughout the genome other than previously reported deletions at coding sequence of the ORF8 (open reading frame), spike, and ORF7a proteins, specifically in polyprotein ORF1ab (n = 9), ORF10 (n = 1), and 3´-UTR (n = 2). Evidence from the systematic gene-level mutational and protein profile analyses revealed a large number of amino acid (aa) substitutions (n = 744), demonstrating the viral proteins heterogeneous. Notably, residues of receptor-binding domain (RBD) showing crucial interactions with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and cross-reacting neutralizing antibody were found to be conserved among the analyzed virus strains, except for replacement of lysine with arginine at 378th position of the cryptic epitope of a Shanghai isolate, hCoV-19/Shanghai/SH0007/2020 (EPI_ISL_416320). Furthermore, our results of the preliminary epidemiological data on SARS-CoV-2 infections revealed that frequency of aa mutations were relatively higher in the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences of Europe (43.07%) followed by Asia (38.09%), and North America (29.64%) while case fatality rates remained higher in the European temperate countries, such as Italy, Spain, Netherlands, France, England and Belgium. Thus, the present method of genome annotation employed at this early pandemic stage could be a promising tool for monitoring and tracking the continuously evolving pandemic situation, the associated genetic variants, and their implications for the development of effective control and prophylaxis strategies.","Islam, M Rafiul; Hoque, M Nazmul; Rahman, M Shaminur; Alam, A S M Rubayet Ul; Akther, Masuda; Puspo, J Akter; Akter, Salma; Sultana, Munawar; Crandall, Keith A; Hossain, M Anwar",Sci Rep,350,1

Furthermore, associations between sex hormones and systemic inflammation markers, viral shedding and length of hospital stay were studied. DESIGN AND METHODS: This case-control study included a total of 48 male patients with COVID-19 admitted to an Italian reference hospital. The 24 cases were patients with PaO2/FiO2 <250 mmHg and who needed ventilatory support during hospitalization (severe COVID-19). The 24 controls were selected in a 1:1 ratio, matched by age, from patients who maintained PaO2/FiO2 >300 mmHg at all times and who may have required low-flow oxygen supplementation during hospitalization (mild COVID-19). For each group, sex hormones were evaluated on hospital admission. RESULTS: Patients with severe COVID-19 (cases) had a significantly lower testosterone level compared with patients with mild COVID-19 (controls). Median total testosterone (TT) was 1.4 ng/mL in cases and 3.5 ng/mL in controls (P = 0.005); median bioavailable testosterone (BioT) was 0.49 and 1.21 in cases and controls, respectively (P = 0.008); and median calculated free testosterone (cFT) was 0.029 ng/mL and 0.058 ng/mL in cases and controls, respectively (P = 0.015). Low TT, low cFT and low BioT were correlated with hyperinflammatory syndrome (P = 0.018, P = 0.048 and P = 0.020, respectively) and associated with longer length of hospital stay (P = 0.052, P = 0.041 and P = 0.023, respectively). No association was found between sex hormone level and duration of viral shedding, or between sex hormone level and mortality rate.

Exposure to respiratory droplets can theoretically be reduced by surgical mask usage. However, there is a lack of experimental evidence supporting surgical mask usage for prevention of COVID-19. METHODS: We used a well-established golden Syrian hamster SARS-CoV-2 model. We placed SARS-CoV-2-challenged index hamsters and naive hamsters into closed system units each comprising 2 different cages separated by a polyvinyl chloride air porous partition with unidirectional airflow within the isolator. The effect of a surgical mask partition placed between the cages was investigated. Besides clinical scoring, hamster specimens were tested for viral load, histopathology, and viral nucleocapsid antigen expression. RESULTS: Noncontact transmission was found in 66.7% (10/15) of exposed naive hamsters. Surgical mask partition for challenged index or naive hamsters significantly reduced transmission to 25% (6/24, P = .018). Surgical mask partition for challenged index hamsters significantly reduced transmission to only 16.7% (2/12, P = .019) of exposed naive hamsters. Unlike the severe manifestations of challenged hamsters, infected naive hamsters had lower clinical scores, milder histopathological changes, and lower viral nucleocapsid antigen expression in respiratory tract tissues. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted by respiratory droplets or airborne droplet nuclei which could be reduced by surgical mask partition in the hamster model. This is the first in vivo experimental evidence to support the possible benefit of surgical mask in prevention of COVID-19 transmission, especially when masks were worn by infected individuals.","Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; Yuan, Shuofeng; Zhang, Anna Jinxia; Poon, Vincent Kwok-Man; Chan, Chris Chung-Sing; Lee, Andrew Chak-Yiu; Fan, Zhimeng; Li, Can; Liang, Ronghui; Cao, Jianli; Tang, Kaiming; Luo, Cuiting; Cheng, Vincent Chi-Chung; Cai, Jian-Piao; Chu, Hin; Chan, Kwok-Hung; To, Kelvin Kai-Wang; Sridhar, Siddharth; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Clin Infect Dis,350,14

The aim of this paper is to describe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hip and knee arthroplasties in an Italian high-volume orthopedic center, located in the region of the country first and worst affected by the Coronavirus. METHODS: Data from an institutional database were retrospectively analyzed to obtain the number of hip and knee arthroplasties performed from February 24 to April 10 2020. The figures were compared with those of the same 7-week period of the last year (2019). RESULTS: The number of hip and knee arthroplasties showed a decrease from 706 in the same period of 2019 to 166 (76.5% less) in the current year. In 2019, a mean of 101 ± 9 hip and knee arthroplasties were performed per week compared with a mean of 24 ± 34 in 2020. Ten patients tested positive for SARS-CoV2 during their hospital stay. Two of these patients died after a regular postoperative period after developing unexpectedly COVID-19 during rehabilitation. The mortality in the 7-week period of the current year was 1.2% compared with 0% in 2019. CONCLUSION: The outbreak of COVID-19 had a considerable effect in our center on the number of hip and knee arthroplasties that rapidly decreased to 0 in parallel to the worsening of the situation in the country.

Symptoms can be severe and lead to the interruption of cancer treatments. However, there is limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying 5-FU-induced intestinal toxicity. In this study, well-established 3D organoid models of human colon and small intestine (SI) were used to characterize 5-FU transcriptomic and metabolomic responses. Clinically relevant 5-FU concentrations for in vitro testing in organoids were established using physiologically based pharmacokinetic simulation of dosing regimens recommended for cancer patients, resulting in exposures to 10, 100 and 1000 µM. After treatment, different measurements were performed: cell viability and apoptosis; image analysis of cell morphological changes; RNA sequencing; and metabolome analysis of supernatant from organoids cultures. Based on analysis of the differentially expressed genes, the most prominent molecular pathways affected by 5-FU included cell cycle, p53 signalling, mitochondrial ATP synthesis and apoptosis. Short time-series expression miner demonstrated tissue-specific mechanisms affected by 5-FU, namely biosynthesis and transport of small molecules, and mRNA translation for colon; cell signalling mediated by Rho GTPases and fork-head box transcription factors for SI. Metabolomic analysis showed that in addition to the effects on TCA cycle and oxidative stress in both organoids, tissue-specific metabolic alterations were also induced by 5-FU. Multi-omics integration identified transcription factor E2F1, a regulator of cell cycle and apoptosis, as the best key node across all samples. These results provide new insights into 5-FU toxicity mechanisms and underline the relevance of human organoid models in the safety assessment in drug development.","Rodrigues, Daniela; de Souza, Terezinha; Coyle, Luke; Di Piazza, Matteo; Herpers, Bram; Ferreira, Sofia; Zhang, Mian; Vappiani, Johanna; Sévin, Daniel C; Gabor, Attila; Lynch, Anthony; Chung, Seung-Wook; Saez-Rodriguez, Julio; Jennen, Danyel G J; Kleinjans, Jos C S; de Kok, Theo M",Arch. toxicol,350,30

However, most families do not have access to in-person, evidence-based treatment. We previously developed and tested DRIVE (Developing Relationships that Include Values of Eating and Exercise), a home-based parent training program to maintain body weight among children at risk for obesity, with the intent to eventually disseminate it nationally alongside SafeCare, a parent support program that focuses on parent-child interactions. Currently the DRIVE program has only been tested independently of SafeCare. This study created the ""mHealth DRIVE"" program by further adapting DRIVE to incorporate digital and mobile health tools, including remotely delivered sessions, a wireless scale that enabled a child-tailored weight graph, and a pedometer. Telehealth delivery via mHealth platforms and other digital tools can improve program cost-effectiveness, deliver long-term care, and directly support both families and care providers. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine preliminary acceptability and effectiveness of the mHealth DRIVE program among children and parents who received it and among SafeCare providers who potentially could deliver it. METHODS: Study 1 was a 13-week pilot study of a remotely delivered mHealth family-based weight management program. Satisfaction surveys were administered, and height and weight were measured pre- and post-study. Study 2 was a feasibility/acceptability survey administered to SafeCare providers. RESULTS: Parental and child satisfaction (mean of 4.9/6.0 and 3.8/5.0, respectively) were high, and children's (N=10) BMI z-scores significantly decreased (mean -0.14, SD 0.17; P=.025). Over 90% of SafeCare providers (N=74) indicated that SafeCare families would benefit from learning how to eat healthily and be more active, and 80% of providers reported that they and the families would benefit from digital tools to support child weight management.

The results suggested that photosynthesis was enhanced as H2S improved the tobacco &#934;PSII, ETR, Photo, Cond, and Tr, and that by increasing the NPQ, it consumed considerable amount of energy to enhance plant resistances during Cd2+ exposure. Furthermore, H2S increased the gene transcription of NtSOD3, NtPOD1, and CAT1, to enhance antioxidant enzyme activity, which reduces the generation of the reactive oxygen protective membrane integrity. Additionally, H2S increased the gene expression of the tobacco PC genes, Pr2 and Pr8 promoted the formation of the Cd2+ complexes and transportation to the vacuole, resulting in improved Cd-ATPase gene expression, away from organelles, to alleviate the Cd2+ poison. Furthermore, H2S regulated the relative absorption of K+ and Ca2+, which antagonized the Cd2+, and reduced its transportation to the aboveground plant material. Finally, the expression level of CaM increased with the application of H2S, and was highly correlated with the fitted results of a variety of resistance indicators, thereby indicating that H2S regulatory resistance mechanisms might be associated with Ca2+ signal transduction.","Wang, Hong-Rui; Che, Yan-Hui; Wang, Zi-Han; Zhang, Bei-Ning; Huang, Dan; Feng, Fujuan; Ao, Hong",J Hazard Mater,350,20

The study aims to assess the incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in COVID-19 patients admitted to a single tertiary hospital. METHODS: From April 2nd to April 18th, 2020, hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were screened by lower limb duplex ultrasound (DUS). Patients were on (low molecular weight heparin) LMWH prophylaxis in medical wards, and on therapeutic anticoagulation in intensive care unit (ICU). DVT risk factors, reported by the Padua prediction score and blood tests, were retrieved from institutional electronic charts. The study primary endpoint was the incidence of DVT in the in-hospital COVID-19 population and its association with clinical and laboratory risk factors. The secondary endpoint was the association of DVT with mortality. RESULTS: Two hundred patients (median age 62 years, 72% male, 40 in ICU) received DUS screening. DVT was observed in 29 patients (14.5%), with proximal extension in 16 patients, and in association with symptoms in four patients. The DVT rate was similar in ICU (12.5%) and non-ICU patients (15%). Eighty-seven patients underwent a computed tomography angiography (CTA) that showed pulmonary embolism in 35 patients (40.2%) not associated with DVT in 25/35 cases (71.4%). DVT in the ten patients with pulmonary embolism were symptomatic in four and with a proximal localization in eight cases. A D-dimer level &#8805;5 mg/l at admission was predictive of DVT (OR 1.02; IC95% 1.03-1.16; p = .003). At the multivariate analysis in-hospital mortality was predicted by age (OR 1.06; 95% CI 0.02-1.15; p = .004) and by being an ICU patient (OR 1.23; 95% CI 0.30-2.25; p = .01). CONCLUSIONS: Despite LMWH prophylaxis or full anticoagulant therapy, the incidence of DVT, mainly asymptomatic, in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was 14.5%. Further research should focus on the appropriate antithrombotic therapy for COVID-19 patients.","Baccellieri, Domenico; Bertoglio, Luca; Apruzzi, Luca; Ardita, Vincenzo; D039,; Angelo, Armando; Bossi, Matteo; Rinaldi, Enrico; Bilman, Victor; Calvisi, Stefania; Castagna, Antonella; Galli, Laura; Landoni, Giovanni; Melissano, Germano; Querini, Patrizia Rovere; Tresoldi, Moreno; De Cobelli, Francesco; Zangrillo, Alberto; Ciceri, Fabio; Chiesa, Roberto",Phlebology,350,21

However, the fast production of COVID-19 vaccines has caused concern among the general public regarding their safety and efficacy. In particular, patients with chronic illnesses, such as celiac disease (CD), may be more fearful. Information on vaccine hesitancy plays a pivotal role in the development of an efficient vaccination campaign. In our study, we aimed to evaluate COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among Italian CD patients. (2) Methods: an anonymous questionnaire was sent to CD patients followed at our tertiary referral center for CD in Milan, Italy. Patients were defined as willing, hesitant and refusing. We evaluated the reasons for hesitancy/refusal and the possible determinants, calculating crude and adjusted odds ratios [AdjORs] with 95% confidence intervals [CIs]. (3) Results: the questionnaire was sent to 346 patients with a response rate of 29.8%. Twenty-six (25.2%) of the 103 respondents were hesitant, with a total refusal rate of 4.8%. The main reason was fear of adverse events related to vaccination (68.2%). Among hesitant patients, 23% declared that their opinion was influenced by their CD. The determinants positively influencing willingness to be vaccinated against COVID-19 were adherence to a GFD, perception of good knowledge about COVID-19 and its vaccines, and a positive attitude to previous vaccines (AdjOR 12.71, 95% CI 1.82–88.58, AdjOR 6.50, 95% CI 1.44–29.22, AdjOR 0.70, 95% CI 0.11–4.34, respectively).

Therefore, winter honey bees, which have a long life span, could be exposed to these pesticides for longer periods than summer honey bees. In this study, winter honey bees were exposed through food to the insecticide imidacloprid, the fungicide difenoconazole and the herbicide glyphosate, alone or in binary and ternary mixtures, at environmental concentrations (0 (controls), 0.1, 1 and 10 µg/L) for 20 days. The survival of the honey bees was significantly reduced after exposure to these 3 pesticides individually and in combination. Overall, the combinations had a higher impact than the pesticides alone with a maximum mortality of 52.9% after 20 days of exposure to the insecticide-fungicide binary mixture at 1 µg/L. The analyses of the surviving bees showed that these different pesticide combinations had a systemic global impact on the physiological state of the honey bees, as revealed by the modulation of head, midgut and abdomen glutathione-S-transferase, head acetylcholinesterase, abdomen glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and midgut alkaline phosphatase, which are involved in the detoxification of xenobiotics, the nervous system, defenses against oxidative stress, metabolism and immunity, respectively.

The use of FFP3 masks is required in aerosol-forming situations, such as endotracheal intubation or bronchoscopy. In contrast to surgical face masks, there is a maximum wearing time for FFPs masks. Furthermore, in a pandemic there is a basic danger of PPE shortage and recycling of face masks is under discussion. Therefore, usage of non-EU certified PPE may come into effect but this has to follow the requirements defined by European regulations. The aim of this article is to provide an overview of the currently relevant rules and regulations in Germany.","Mayr, N P; Sernetz, S; Heitzer, F; Joner, M; Tassani-Prell, P",Anaesthesist,350,25

This review will analyze the rapidly increasing knowledge of COVID-19 induced lung pathophysiology. Although controversial, the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with COVID-19 (CARDS) seems to present as two distinct phenotypes: Type-L and Type-H. The 'L' refers to Low elastance, ventilation/perfusion ratio, lung weight, and recruitability, and the 'H' refers to High pulmonary elastance, shunt, edema, and recruitability. However, the LUNG SAFE and ESICM Trials Groups has shown that ~13% of the mechanically ventilated non-COVID-19 ARDS patients have the Type-L phenotype. However, other studies have shown that CARDS and ARDS respiratory mechanics overlap and that standard ventilation strategies apply to these patients. The mechanisms causing alterations in pulmonary perfusion could be caused by some combination of: 1) renin-angiotensin system (RAS) dysregulation, 2) thrombosis caused by loss of endothelial barrier, 3) endothelial dysfunction causing loss of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) perfusion control, and 4) hyper-perfusion of collapsed lung tissue that has been directly measured and supported by a computational model. A flow chart has been constructed highlighting the need for personalized and adaptive ventilation strategies, such as the time controlled adaptive ventilation (TCAV) method to set and adjust the airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) mode, which recently was shown effective at improving oxygenation and reducing FiO2, vasopressors, and sedation in COVID-19 patients.","Habashi, Nader M; Camporota, Luigi; Gatto, Louis A; Nieman, Gary F",,350,16

The present research aimed at assessing multiple sociodemographic and psychological variables for parental well-being during the lockdown. An online survey was administered from 6 to 11 April 2020. Respondents were 917 parents aged 23-67 years with up to six children, aged 3-13 years. The measures employed were: 14 demographic questions, the Big Five Inventory (BFI-10), the Emotional Symptoms and Hyperactivity-Inattention subscales of the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ-P), and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Multiple moderated linear regression analyses were performed. Motherhood, higher levels of education, higher neuroticism, lower extroversion, and more child emotional and hyperactivity-inattention symptoms were found to be significant predictors of parent distress. Furthermore, a significant two-way interaction between child emotional problems and parent extroversion was found. Overall, parents showed high rates of psychological distress, signalling severe difficulties during the lockdown. Families with a child suffering from emotional and behavioural difficulties should immediately be detected by social services to activate support interventions to prevent chronic and amplified manifestations of these problems.","Mazza, Cristina; Marchetti, Daniela; Ricci, Eleonora; Fontanesi, Lilybeth; Di Giandomenico, Serena; Verrocchio, Maria Cristina; Roma, Paolo",,350,15

Using a newly developed data collection tool, inspired by the Experience Sampling Method, a total of 197 episodes were collected about children's engagement with recorded music. Findings showed that while mothers utilized music to fulfill various emotional needs, they tended to use it to maintain or reinforce their child's positive mood rather than to improve a negative mood. Also, mothers' reports suggested various ways that young children engaged with music, being aligned with the multimodal nature of their musical experiences. Lastly, mothers reported that their strategic approaches to use recorded music seemed to help their children feel less distressed and happier, and this, in turn, aided in the reduction of some of the burdens associated with parenting.","Cho, E.; Ilari, B.

Although it provides a sub-linear regret bound, such techniques completely ignore the importance of learning with fairness which is a significant hallmark of human intelligence. (2) Online Fairness-Aware Learning. This setting captures many classification problems for which fairness is a concern. But it aims to attain zero-shot generalization without any task-specific adaptation. This therefore limits the capability of a model to adapt onto newly arrived data. To overcome such issues and bridge the gap, in this paper for the first time we proposed a novel online meta-learning algorithm, namely FFML, which is under the setting of unfairness prevention. The key part of FFML is to learn good priors of an online fair classification model's primal and dual parameters that are associated with the model's accuracy and fairness, respectively. The problem is formulated in the form of a bi-level convex-concave optimization. Theoretic analysis provides sub-linear upper bounds for loss regret and for violation of cumulative fairness constraints.

Protein structure-based docking is a widely applied approach for discovering active compounds against drug targets and for predicting potential targets of active compounds. However, this approach has its inherent deficiency caused by e.g. various different conformations with largely varied binding pockets adopted by proteins, or the lack of true target proteins in the database. This deficiency may result in false negative results. As a complementary approach to the protein structure-based platform for COVID-19, termed as D3Docking in our previous work, we developed in this study a ligand-based method, named D3Similarity, which is based on the molecular similarity evaluation between the submitted molecule(s) and those in an active compound database.

Its impact on higher education has been direct, swift and devastating. Higher education institutions (HEIs) form the backbone of progress towards Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs 2030) in their stewardship of research and innovation, engagement with policy debates and commitment to the education and training of professionals. The crucial element that facilitates this trajectory, however, is women’s participation in HEIs, premised on principles of equity and inclusivity, widening participation and access that enables individual empowerment and prosperity on the one hand and ensures valuable contributions towards the SDGs 2030 on the other hand. Nevertheless, it is now feared that COVID 19 may reverse the gains made towards Goal 4 of SDGs 2030, as it structures new barriers that make it difficult for girls to stay in education. This is a major worry because the ripple effect from this may not only derail achievement of Goal 5 but other SDGs as well. Given that the World Bank and UNESCO anticipate large number of students, especially girls in poor countries to drop out of education, the question is, would it be the same for females in higher education? As formal education is relocated in homes, where unequal gendered relations of power might play out strongly against them. Women may find it difficult to pursue their higher education. This may be because of their limited access to resources, burden of domestic work, caring responsibilities, domestic violence, mental and physical health or sociocultural norms. Conversely, the question is also, does this virtual space of higher education, offer some unique opportunities for us to facilitate the access of women to higher education and ensure their retention? Is it an opportunity to rethink education in a way that is more inclusive and flexible?

Southeast Asia was the first region to be affected outside China, and although COVID-19 cases have been reported in all countries of Southeast Asia, both the policies and epidemic trajectories differ substantially, potentially due to marked differences in social distancing measures that have been implemented by governments in the region. This paper studies the across-country relationships between social distancing and each population's response to policy, the subsequent effects of these responses to the transmissibility and epidemic trajectories of SARS-CoV-2. The analysis couples COVID-19 case counts with real-time mobility data across Southeast Asia to estimate the effects of host population response to social distancing policy and the subsequent effects on the transmissibility and epidemic trajectories of SARS-CoV-2. A novel inference strategy for the time-varying reproduction number is developed to allow explicit inference of the effects of social distancing on the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 through a regression structure.

This disease has spread to 215 nations, affecting a diverse variety of persons. It was formally called extreme acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2), also known as coronavirus disease, by the World Health Organization as a pandemic. This pandemic forced countries to enforce a socio-economic lockdown to avoid its widespread presence. This study focuses on how the pollution of particulate matter during the coronavirus pandemic in the period from 23 March 2020 to 31 December 2020 was reduced compared to the pre-pandemic situation in the country. The improvement in air quality and atmosphere due to the coronavirus pandemic in Pakistan was identified by both ground-based and satellite observations with a primary focus on the four provincial capitals and country capitals, namely, Peshawar, Karachi, Quetta, Lahore, and Islamabad, and statistically verified through paired Student's t test. Both datasets have shown a significant decrease in the levels of PM2.5 pollutions across Pakistan (ranging from 15 to 35% for satellite observations, while 27 to 61% for ground-based observations). The result shows that poor air quality is one of the key factors for a higher COVID-19 spread rate in major Pakistani cities. By extending the same investigation across the nation, there is a greater need to investigate the connections between COVID-19 spread and air pollution. However, both higher population density rates and frequent population exposure can be partially attributed to increased levels of PM2.5 concentrations before the pandemic of the coronavirus.","Khan, Yousaf Ali",Environ. sci. pollut. res. int.

The development of a vaccine is likely to take at least 12-18 months, and the typical timeline for approval of a new antiviral therapeutic agent can exceed 10 years. Thus, repurposing of known drugs could substantially accelerate the deployment of new therapies for COVID-19. Here we profiled a library of drugs encompassing approximately 12,000 clinical-stage or Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved small molecules to identify candidate therapeutic drugs for COVID-19. We report the identification of 100 molecules that inhibit viral replication of SARS-CoV-2, including 21 drugs that exhibit dose-response relationships. Of these, thirteen were found to harbour effective concentrations commensurate with probable achievable therapeutic doses in patients, including the PIKfyve kinase inhibitor apilimod2-4 and the cysteine protease inhibitors MDL-28170, Z LVG CHN2, VBY-825 and ONO 5334. Notably, MDL-28170, ONO 5334 and apilimod were found to antagonize viral replication in human pneumocyte-like cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, and apilimod also demonstrated antiviral efficacy in a primary human lung explant model. Since most of the molecules identified in this study have already advanced into the clinic, their known pharmacological and human safety profiles will enable accelerated preclinical and clinical evaluation of these drugs for the treatment of COVID-19.","Riva, Laura; Yuan, Shuofeng; Yin, Xin; Martin-Sancho, Laura; Matsunaga, Naoko; Pache, Lars; Burgstaller-Muehlbacher, Sebastian; De Jesus, Paul D; Teriete, Peter; Hull, Mitchell V; Chang, Max W; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; Cao, Jianli; Poon, Vincent Kwok-Man; Herbert, Kristina M; Cheng, Kuoyuan; Nguyen, Tu-Trinh H; Rubanov, Andrey; Pu, Yuan; Nguyen, Courtney; Choi, Angela; Rathnasinghe, Raveen; Schotsaert, Michael; Miorin, Lisa; Dejosez, Marion; Zwaka, Thomas P; Sit, Ko-Yung; Martinez-Sobrido, Luis; Liu, Wen-Chun; White, Kris M; Chapman, Mackenzie E; Lendy, Emma K; Glynne, Richard J; Albrecht, Randy; Ruppin, Eytan; Mesecar, Andrew D; Johnson, Jeffrey R; Benner, Christopher; Sun, Ren; Schultz, Peter G; Su, Andrew I; García-Sastre, Adolfo; Chatterjee, Arnab K; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; Chanda, Sumit K",Nature,350,17

Mutations in TSC1 or TSC2 was proved to be associated with these conditions. METHODS: Gene-panel Sequence of NGS was used to detect the mutation in a Chinese family. The research further investigates whether aberrant splicing and nonsense-mediated mRNA degradation (NMD) could serve as a mechanism cause by TSC1 mutation. MINI-Gene assay apply by pcMINI-TSC1wt/mut plasmids delivered in HeLa and 293T cell lines. Recombinant plasmids expressing wild-type and mutant-type EGFP-TSC1 were constructed and transiently transfected into human embryonic kidney cells 293T by lipofectamine. Real-time PCR and Western Blot were performed to analyze the expression of mRNAs and proteins of EGFP-TSC1 and NMD factor UPF1. RESULTS: The gene test verified a novel heterozygous TSC1 frameshift mutation (TSC1 c.1550_1551del) in the proband and her mother. From MINI-Gene assay, the agarose gel showed that both the mutant and wild-type mRNA possess two main bands, indicating two splicing modes, named band A and B, respectively. The mutation c.1550_1551del has not produced new splicing site, but there is a selective splicing in varying degree significantly after mutation. On the contrary, function validation assay showed that cells transfected with the mutant TSC1 plasmids expressed significantly lower TSC1 in mRNAs and proteins levels, compared with the wild-type TSC1 plasmid transfection. A translation inhibitor cycloheximide and small interfering RNA of UPF1 (siRNA-UPF1) increased mRNA or protein expression of TSC1 significantly in cells transfected with the mutant plasmids. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that the novel TSC1 frameshift mutation (TSC1 c.1550_1551del) trigger aberrant splicing and NMD simultaneously, causing decrease of hamartin, then, leading to tuberous sclerosis complex formation.","Qiu, Cong; Li, Chengyan; Tong, Xiaoyun; Dai, Luoyang; Liu, Wenda; Xie, Yulie; Zhang, Qimei; Yang, Guohua; Li, Tao",Mol Genet Genomic Med,350,20

METHODS: We did a multicenter randomized open-labeled clinical trial on moderate to severe cases infections of SARS-CoV-2. Patients with typical ground glass appearance on chest computerized tomography scan (CT scan) and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of less than 93% were enrolled. They were randomly allocated into Favipiravir (1.6 gr loading, 1.8 gr daily) and Lopinavir/Ritonavir (800/200 mg daily) treatment regimens in addition to standard care. In-hospital mortality, ICU admission, intubation, time to clinical recovery, changes in daily SpO2 after 5 min discontinuation of supplemental oxygen, and length of hospital stay were quantified and compared in the two groups. RESULTS: 380 patients were randomly allocated into Favipiravir (193) and Lopinavir/Ritonavir (187) groups in 13 centers. The number of deaths, intubations, and ICU admissions were not significantly different (26, 27, 31 and 21, 17, 25 respectively). Mean hospital stay was also not different (7.9 days [SD = 6] in the Favipiravir and 8.1 [SD = 6.5] days in Lopinavir/Ritonavir groups) (p = 0.61).

DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey administered via Qualtrics among 18-75-year-old participants in the UK. The sample was stratified by age and gender with quotas defined according to the 2011 UK census distribution. SETTING: Qualtrics' Online panel of respondents in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: 676 participants comprising nearly an equal number of females (n 341) and males (n 335) and a majority (58·6 %) from households whose income was <£30 000. RESULTS: Our findings showed that nearly 40 % of respondents were exposed to some or a lot of CNI. We found that while exposure to CNI from TV and online news increased nutrition confusion, CNI from health professionals increased backlash. Exposure to CNI from social media and health websites was associated with reduced backlash. We also found that nutrition confusion and backlash were negatively associated with exercise behaviour and fruit and vegetable consumption, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports the theoretical pathways that explain the influence of CNI exposure on nutrition-related cognitive and behavioural outcomes. Additionally, different types of online information sources are associated with these outcomes to varying degrees. In the context of obesity and diabetes rates in the UK, our findings call for (a) further experimental research into the effects of CNI on consumers' diet-related cognitions and behaviours and (b) multi-stakeholder, interdisciplinary approaches to address this problem.","Vijaykumar, Santosh; McNeill, Andrew; Simpson, Joshua",Public Health Nutr,350,1

In this study, we sought to describe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on inpatient use within children's hospitals. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study using the Pediatric Health Information System. We compared inpatient use and clinical outcomes for children 0 to 18 years of age during the COVID-19 period (March 15 to August 29, 2020) to the same time frame in the previous 3 years (pre-COVID-19 period). Adjusted generalized linear mixed models were used to examine the association of the pandemic period with inpatient use. We assessed trends overall and for a subgroup of 15 medical All Patient Refined Diagnosis Related Groups (APR-DRGs). RESULTS: We identified 424 856 hospitalizations (mean: 141 619 hospitalizations per year) in the pre-COVID-19 period and 91 532 in the COVID-19 period. Compared with the median number of hospitalizations in the pre-COVID-19 period, we observed declines in hospitalizations overall (35.1%), and by APR-DRG (range: 8.5%-81.3%) with asthma (81.3%), bronchiolitis (80.1%), and pneumonia (71.4%) experiencing the greatest declines. Overall readmission rates were lower during the COVID-19 period; however, other outcomes, including length of stay, cost, ICU use, and mortality remained similar to the pre-COVID-19 period with some variability by APR-DRGs. CONCLUSIONS: US children's hospitals observed substantial reductions in inpatient admissions with largely unchanged hospital-level outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the impact on use varied by condition, the most notable declines were related to inpatient admissions for respiratory conditions, including asthma, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia.","Markham, Jessica L; Richardson, Troy; DePorre, Adrienne; Teufel, Ronald J; Hersh, Adam L; Fleegler, Eric W; Antiel, Ryan M; Williams, Daniel C; Goldin, Adam B; Shah, Samir S",Pediatrics,350,0

While 99.19% of the sample reported average to high compassion satisfaction, 63.71% reported average burnout and 49.59% reported average secondary trauma. Findings indicate that social workers are reporting higher than national estimates of PTSD, indicating a greater need for more emotional support during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the significance and severity of the pandemic, it is essential that organizations provide resources for both immediate and ongoing support for the emotional well-being of their employees.","Holmes, Megan R; Rentrope, C Robin; Korsch-Williams, Amy; King, Jennifer A",Clin Soc Work J,350,23

This paper examines the introduction, transmission, and incidence of COVID-19 into Pacific SIDS. METHODS: Calculate the rate of transmission (the average number of new cases per day between the first recorded case and the most recent day) and connectivity (daily direct flights to the leading airport in each selected island group) using flight history and COVID-19 transmission data. RESULTS: Correlational analyses show that connectivity is positively related with (a) first-case dates and (b) spread rate in Pacific SIDS. CONCLUSION: Connectivity plays a central role in the spread of COVID-19 in Pacific SIDS. The continued entry of people was a significant factor for spread within countries. Efforts to prevent transmission by closing borders reduced transmission but also created significant economic hardship because many Pacific SIDS rely heavily on tourism and international exchange. The findings highlight the importance of exploring the possibility that the COVID-19 spread rate may be higher than official figures indicate, and present pathways to mitigate socio-economic impacts. The practical implications of the findings reveal the vulnerability of Pacific SIDS to pandemics and the key role of connectivity in the spread of COVID-19 in the Pacific region.","Leal Filho, Walter; Lütz, Johannes M; Sattler, David N; Nunn, Patrick D",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),350,20

To reduce the impact of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses on patients and healthcare workers (HCWs) we devised and evaluated a multi-tiered infection control strategy with the goal of preventing nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV2 and other RVIs across a large healthcare campus. METHODS: From January-June 2020, a multi-tiered infection control strategy was implemented across a healthcare campus in Singapore, comprising the largest acute tertiary hospital as well as four other subspecialty centres, with more than 10,000 HCWs. Drawing on our institution's experience with an outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, this strategy included improved patient segregation and distancing, and heightened infection prevention and control (IPC) measures including universal masking. All symptomatic patients were tested for COVID-19 and common RVIs. RESULTS: A total of 16,162 admissions campus-wide were screened; 7.1% (1155/16,162) tested positive for COVID-19. Less than 5% of COVID-19 cases (39/1155) were initially detected outside of isolation wards in multi-bedded cohorted wards. Improved distancing and enhanced IPC measures successfully mitigated onward spread even amongst COVID-19 cases detected outside of isolation. COVID-19 rates amongst HCWs were kept low (0.13%, 17/13,066) and reflected community acquisition rather than nosocomial spread. Rates of healthcare-associated-RVI amongst inpatients fell to zero and this decrease was sustained even after the lifting of visitor restrictions. CONCLUSION: This multi-tiered infection control strategies can be implemented at-scale to successfully mitigate healthcare-associated transmission of respiratory viral pathogens.","Wee, Liang En; Venkatachalam, Indumathi; Sim, Xiang Ying Jean; Tan, Kenneth Boon-Kiat; Wen, Ruan; Tham, Chee Kian; Gan, Wee Hoe; Ko, Kwan Ki Karrie; Ho, Wan Qi; Kwek, Grace Teck Cheng; Conceicao, Edwin Philip; Sng, Chong Yu Edwin; Ng, Xin Hui Jorin; Ong, Jie Yi; Chiang, Juat Lan; Chua, Ying Ying; Ling, Moi Lin; Tan, Thuan Tong; Wijaya, Limin",Infect.

Multiple regression analysis was used to determine the effect of these angles on the QML/FL. RESULTS: The QML/FL was increased with the hip extended (standardized partial regression coefficient 0.855 with linear plotting, 0.829 with log plotting) and with the stifle flexed (standardized partial regression coefficient 0.814 with linear plotting, 0.800 with log plotting). The partial regression coefficient of the hip abduction-adduction angle was small, indicating a small impact on the QML/FL. The 95% confidence range of the QML/FL with the hip extended and stifle flexed was 0.87 to 1.00 (mean ± standard deviation: 0.93 ± 0.03). CONCLUSION: The QML/FL was more influenced by joint angles when the hip was flexed or the stifle was extended. Hence, these positions should be avoided when evaluating the QML/FL so that the QML is less altered by slight positioning disparities.","Murakami, Sawako; Nagahiro, Yukari; Shimada, Masakazu; Kanno, Nobuo; Suzuki, Shuji; Yogo, Takuya; Harada, Yasuji; Hara, Yasushi",Vet. comp. orthop. traumatol,350,1

Given the proliferation of AI for Social Good initiatives, this is an emerging gap that needs to be addressed in order to develop more meaningful ethical approaches to AI use and development. This paper offers a methodology, a shared fairness approach, aimed at identifying the needs of AI practitioners when it comes to confronting and resolving ethical challenges and to find a third space where their operational language can be married with that of the more abstract principles that presently remain at the periphery of their work experiences. We offer a grassroots approach to operational ethics based on dialog and mutualised responsibility. This methodology is centred around conversations intended to elicit practitioners perceived ethical attribution and distribution over key value laden operational decisions, to identify when these decisions arise and what ethical challenges they confront, and to engage in a language of ethics and responsibility which enables practitioners to internalise ethical responsibility. The methodology bridges responsibility imbalances that rest in structural decision making power and elite technical knowledge, by commencing with personal, facilitated conversations, returning the ethical discourse to those meant to give it meaning at the sharp end of the ecosystem. Our primary contribution is to add to the recent literature seeking to bring AI practitioners' experiences to the fore by offering a methodology for understanding how ethics manifests as a relational and interdependent sociotechnical practice in their work.","Findlay, Mark; Seah, Josephine",,350,16

This was a prospective, observational, physiological, cohort study on consecutive adult patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted in April-May 2020 in the high dependency respiratory unit of L. Sacco University Hospital in Milan (Italy). During hospitalization, patients underwent chest computed tomography (CT), blood gas analysis, spirometry, and lung diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLco), which were repeated 6 weeks post-discharge. Chest CTs were individually read by two expert radiologists, that calculated the total severity score (TSS). Twenty patients completed the study (mean age 58.2 years, 70% males). During the acute phase, mean DLco, alveolar volume (VA), and vital capacity (VC) were 56.0 (16.3), 64.8 (14.0), and 71.7 (16.9) % predicted, respectively, and were inversely associated with PaO2/FiO2 ratio. Fifty percent of patients had a restrictive ventilatory pattern; mean TSS was 7.9 (4.0). At follow up, gas exchange parameters were normalized; consolidations persisted in 10% of cases, while DLco was <80% predicted in 65% of patients and was independently predicted by Log10D-dimer at admission (ß -18.675; 95%CI, -28.373--9.076; p = 0.001). In conclusion, functional abnormalities in COVID-19 pneumonia survivors can persist during follow up and are associated with the severity of the disease.","Santus, Pierachille; Flor, Nicola; Saad, Marina; Pini, Stefano; Franceschi, Elisa; Airoldi, Andrea; Gaboardi, Paolo; Ippolito, Sonia; Rizzi, Maurizio; Radovanovic, Dejan",,350,17

Fatal CRS occurrences have also plagued the development of highly promising cancer therapies based on T-cell engagers and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. CRS is intimately linked with dysregulated and excessive cytokine release, including IFN-Î³, TNF-&#945;, IL 1, IL-6, and IL-10, resulting in a systemic inflammatory response leading to multiple organ failure. Here, we show that mice intravenously administered the agonistic hamster anti-mouse CD3Îµ monoclonal antibody 145-2C11 develop clinical and laboratory manifestations seen in patients afflicted with CRS, including body weight loss, hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, increased vascular permeability, lung inflammation, and hypercytokinemia. Blood cytokine levels and gene expression analysis from lung, liver, and spleen demonstrated a hierarchy of inflammatory cytokine production and infiltrating immune cells with differentiating organ-dependent kinetics. IL-2, IFN-Î³, TNF-&#945;, and IL-6 up-regulation preceded clinical signs of CRS. The co-treatment of mice with a neutralizing anti-cytokine antibody cocktail transiently improved early clinical and laboratory features of CRS. We discuss the predictive use of this model in the context of new anti-cytokine strategies to treat human CRS.","Nouveau, Lise; Buatois, Vanessa; Cons, Laura; Chatel, Laurence; Pontini, Guillemette; Pleche, Nicolas; Ferlin, Walter G",Eur. j. immunol,350,1

However, due to their strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, clinical studies often do not address challenges presented by non-trial populations. DESIGN: This review summarises available data on the efficacy and safety of ICIs in trial-ineligible patients, including those with autoimmune disease, chronic viral infections, organ transplants, organ dysfunction, poor performance status, and brain metastases, as well as the elderly, children, and those who are pregnant. In addition, we review data concerning other real-world challenges with ICIs, including timing of therapy switch, relationships to radiotherapy or surgery, re-treatment after an immune-related toxicity, vaccinations in patients on ICIs, and current experience around ICI and coronavirus disease-19. Where possible, we provide recommendations to aid the often-difficult decision-making process in those settings. CONCLUSIONS: Data suggest that ICIs are often active and have an acceptable safety profile in the populations described above, with the exception of PD-1 inhibitors in solid organ transplant recipients. Decisions about whether to treat with ICIs should be personalised and require multidisciplinary input and careful counselling of patients with respect to potential risks and benefits. Clinical judgements need to be carefully weighed, considering factors such as underlying cancer type, feasibility of alternative treatment options, or activity in trial-eligible patients.","Rzeniewicz, K; Larkin, J; Menzies, A M; Turajlic, S",Ann. oncol,350,20

Some of these alternative treatments maybe second-best. Treatments that are known to be superior might not be appropriate to deliver during a pandemic when consideration must be given to distributive justice and protection of patients and their medical teams as well the importance given to individual benefit and autonomy. What is required of the doctor discussing these alternative, potentially inferior treatments and seeking consent to proceed? Should doctors share information about unavailable but standard treatment alternatives when seeking consent? There are arguments in defence of non-disclosure; information about unavailable treatments may not aid a patient to weigh up options that are available to them. There might be justified concern about distress for patients who are informed that they are receiving second-best therapies. However, we argue that doctors should tailor information according to the needs of the individual patient. For most patients that will include a nuanced discussion about treatments that would be considered in other times but currently unavailable. That will sometimes be a difficult conversation, and require clinicians to be frank about limited resources and necessary rationing. However, transparency and honesty will usually be the best policy.","Turnham, Helen Lynne; Dunn, Michael; Hill, Elaine; Thornburn, Guy T; Wilkinson, Dominic",J. med. ethics,350,19

METHODS: This cohort study measured SED (activPAL) and MVPA (GT3X) in each trimester of pregnancy. Univariate associations of demographic, socioeconomic, and pregnancy health-related factors with SED or MVPA were calculated. Associations with P < .10 were included in stepwise linear regression models to determine independent predictors in each trimester. RESULTS: Pregnant women (n = 127) were age 31.0 (4.9) years and 78% white. In regression models across trimesters, fewer children &#8804; age 5 in the household (P < .04) and primarily sitting job activity (P < .008) were related to higher SED and use of assisted reproductive technology (P < .05) was associated with higher MVPA.

CONCLUSIONS: Predictors of SED in pregnancy were more consistent, and differed from predictors of MVPA. These findings may help identify women at risk of high SED or low MVPA, though future research in larger samples is needed.","Jones, Melissa A; Whitaker, Kara; Wallace, McKenzie; Barone Gibbs, Bethany",J Phys Act Health,350,26

METHOD: A total of 2115 subjects from 34 provinces in China were evaluated. A questionnaire was designed, which covers demographic characteristics, knowledge of COVID-19, and factors that influenced anxiety during the outbreak to test public awareness and determine the impact of the outbreak on people's lives. In addition, a generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) scale was utilized to assess anxiety levels during the outbreak. Lastly, the chi-square test and multiple logistic regression analysis were used to identify factors associated with levels of public anxiety. RESULTS: A majority of respondents reported high levels of awareness of COVID-19. A total of 1107 (52.3%), 707 (33.4%), 154 (7.3%), and 147 (7%) respondents exhibited no, mild, moderate, and severe levels of anxiety, respectively. Results of the chi-square test and multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that respondents (a) with no college education, (b) are unaware of neighbors who may have been infected, (c) who spent considerable time collecting information and browsing negative information related to the virus, (d) are unhealthy, and (e) displayed low levels of awareness of the transmission routes were highly likely to be anxious. CONCLUSION: During the outbreak, the majority of people exhibited high levels of awareness and knowledge regarding preventive measures from COVID-19. The absence of psychological anxiety was observed in more than half of the respondents. Adaptive responses to anxiety and high levels of awareness about COVID-19 may have protected the public during the outbreak.","Liu, Yunyu; Li, Pengfei; Lv, Yalan; Hou, Xiaorong; Rao, Qingmao; Tan, Juntao; Gong, Jun; Tan, Chao; Liao, Lifan; Cui, Weilu",Compr Psychiatry,350,16

The World Health Organization has evidence-based guidance on how to address missed opportunities for vaccination, albeit predominately applicable for low- and middle-income countries. In Canada, immunization applies beyond infant and childhood immunization, with immunization across the life course being recommended by NACI. Three components stand out and must be integrated and used concurrently for best effect on catch-up in Canada: (1) Identify who has been missed across the life course; (2) detect delivery gaps, adapt and adjust, and develop multipronged tailored strategies for catch-up; and (3) communicate, document, evaluate and readjust the immunization programs. All must be adapted to the reality of the evolving COVID-19 pandemic. We cannot go back to a pre-COVID-19 world.

The pandemic has been a tough test for all European national health systems and their capability to provide an adequate reaction. METHODS: The present work aims to reveal correlations between parameters such as COVID-19 incidence, ICU bed occupancy, ICU excess area, and mortality in Italian regions. Public data for the period of March 1 to July 16, 2020, were analyzed using several mathematical and statistical methods. RESULTS: The analysis defined two separate groups of Italian regions. The examined variables considered within these groups were interlinked and dependent on each other. The regions of the two groups shared the same kind of fitted model (linear) explaining mortality as a function of cumulative incidence, but with higher value of the constant in one group, so characterized by a high intrinsic ""strength"" of the pandemic, certainly playing a major role in the generation of a large number of severe and life-threatening cases. These results are confirmed at European level. Other factors may condition mortality and be linked to incidence, such as ICU saturation and excess. CONCLUSIONS: These quantitative results could be a very helpful tool to set up preventive measures and optimize biomedical interventions before the pandemic, in its recurrent waves, could overcome the reaction capacity of any public health system.","Olivieri, A; Palù, G; Sebastiani, G",Int J Infect Dis,350,1

We examined volume and utilization trends to identify the financial break-even point that might serve to dichotomize between nurse specialist-led and perfusionist-led ECMO programs. METHODS: Data pertaining to patients who required ECMO support between 2018 and 2019 were reviewed. ECMO staffing costs were estimated based on national trends and modelled by annual utilization and case volume. A break-even point was derived from a comparison between nurse specialist-led and perfusionist-led models. For each scenario, direct medical costs were calculated based on utilization which was in turn defined by ""low"" (4 days), ""average"" (10 days), and ""high"" (30 days) duration of time spent on ECMO. RESULTS: Within the time frame, there was a total of 107 ECMO cases with a mean ECMO duration of 11 days, within the study time frame. Overall, ECMO nursing personnel costs were less than those for perfusionists ($108,000 vs $175,000). Programmatic costs were higher in the perfusionist-led versus nurse specialist-led model when annual utilization was greater than 10 cases and ECMO duration was longer than a mean of 9.7 days. There was no difference in survival between the two models. CONCLUSIONS: Use of a perfusionist-led ECMO model may be more cost-conscious in the context of low utilization, smaller case volume and shorter ECMO duration. However, once annual case volume exceeds 10 and mean ECMO duration exceeds 10 days, the nurse specialist-led model may be more cost-conscious.","Dhamija, Ankit; Kakuturu, Jahnavi; Schauble, Drew; Hayanga, Heather K; Jacobs, Jeffrey P; Badhwar, Vinay; Hayanga, J W Awori",Ann. thorac. surg,350,24

CONCLUSIONS: Overweight/obesity among reproductive-age women is a public health problem in Ethiopia, especially for women who are living in urban settings. Therefore, it is important to establish targeted overweight reduction programs with particular emphasis on urban, older aged, educated, and married women. Additionally, encouraging the limitation of the number of family size and alcohol intake can reduce women's overweight/obesity.","Dagnew, Gizachew Worku; Asresie, Melash Belachew",Nutr Health,350,1

Surprisingly, insofar as we know, the behavior of these methods has not been evaluated for data proceeding from a cross-sectional study (multinomial sampling), but only for data that originate in a prospective or retrospective study (two independent binomials sampling). The paper evaluates 15 different methods (10 classic ones and 5 new ones). Because the CI is obtained by inversion in Î¸ of the two-tailed test for H0(Î¸): OR =[Formula: see text] (null hypothesis), this paper evaluates the tests for various values of Î¸, more than the CIs that are obtained. The following statements are valid only for the two-tailed inferences based on 20 &#8804; n &#8804; 200 and 0.05&#8804; OR&#8804;20, since these are the limitations of the study. The two best methods are the classic Cornfield chi-squared method for 0.2&#8804; OR&#8804;5 and, in other cases, the new method of Sterne for chi-squared; but the adjusted likelihood ratio method is a good alternative to the two previous methods, especially to the first when the sample size is large. The three methods require iterative calculations to obtain the CI. If one is looking for methods that are simple to apply (that is, ones that admit a simple, explicit solution), the best option is the Gart logit method for 1/3&#8804; OR&#8804;3 and, if in other cases, the Agresti logit method. The Cornfield chi-squared and Gart logit methods should not be used outside the specified interval OR. The paper also selects the best methods for realizing the classic independence test (Î¸ = 1).","Andrés, Antonio Martín; García, Juan Miguel Tapia; Moreno, Francisco Gayá",J Biopharm Stat,350,15

Treatment with FCBD induced macrophage (differentiated KG1 cell line) polarization and phagocytosis in vitro, and increased CD36 and type II receptor for the Fc region of IgG (FcÎ³RII) expression. FCBD treatment also substantially increased IL-6 and IL-8 expression in macrophages. FCBD:std, while maintaining anti-inflammatory activity in alveolar epithelial cells, led to reduced phagocytosis and pro-inflammatory IL secretion in macrophages in comparison to FCBD.

In England, social distancing measures and a nationwide lockdown were introduced to reduce the spread of the virus. Green space accessibility may have been particularly important during this lockdown, as it could have provided benefits for physical and mental wellbeing. However, the associations between public green space use and the rate of COVID-19 transmission are yet to be quantified, and as the size and accessibility of green spaces vary within England's local authorities, the risks and benefits to the public of using green space may be context-dependent. To evaluate how green space affected COVID-19 transmission across 299 local authorities (small regions) in England, we calculated a daily case rate metric, based upon a seven-day moving average, for each day within the period June 1st - November 30th 2020 and assessed how baseline health and mobility variables influenced these rates. Next, looking at the residual case rates, we investigated how landscape structure (e.g. area and patchiness of green space) and park use influenced transmission. We first show that reducing mobility is associated with a decline in case rates, especially in areas with high population clustering. After accounting for known mechanisms behind transmission rates, we found that park use (showing a preference for park mobility) was associated with decreased residual case rates, especially when green space was low and contiguous (not patchy). Our results support that a reduction in overall mobility may be a good strategy for reducing case rates, endorsing the success of lockdown measures. However, if mobility is necessary, outdoor park use may be safer than other forms of mobility and associated activities (e.g. shopping or office-based working).","Johnson, Thomas F; Hordley, Lisbeth A; Greenwell, Matthew P; Evans, Luke C",Sci Total Environ,350,20

In this retrospective study, we analysed clinical and chest CT data of 24 patients with COVID-19 and 79 patients with influenza pneumonia. Univariate analysis demonstrated that the temperature, systolic pressure, cough and sputum production could distinguish COVID-19 from influenza pneumonia. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for the clinical features are 0.783 and 0.747, and the AUC value is 0.819. Univariate analysis demonstrates that nine CT features, central-peripheral distribution, superior-inferior distribution, anterior-posterior distribution, patches of GGO, GGO nodule, vascular enlargement in GGO, air bronchogram, bronchiectasis within focus, interlobular septal thickening, could distinguish COVID-19 from influenza pneumonia. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for the CT features are 0.750 and 0.962, and the AUC value is 0.927. Finally, a multivariate logistic regression model combined the variables from the clinical variables and CT features models was made. The combined model contained six features: systolic blood pressure, sputum production, vascular enlargement in the GGO, GGO nodule, central-peripheral distribution and bronchiectasis within focus. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for the combined features are 0.87 and 0.96, and the AUC value is 0.961.

Since then, it has arisen as a serious threat to the world public health. Since no approved vaccines or drugs has been found to efficiently stop the virulent spread of the virus, progressive inquiries targeting these viruses are urgently needed, especially those from plant sources. Metabolic profiling using LC-HR-ESI-MS of the butanol extract of Ocimum menthiifolium (Lamiaceae) aerial parts yielded 10 compounds including flavonoids, iridoids and phenolics. As it has been previously reported that some flavonoids can be used as anti-SARS drugs by targeting SARS-CoV-1 3CLpro, we chose to examine 14 flavonoids (detected by metabolomics and other compounds isolated via several chromatographic techniques). We investigated their potential binding interactions with the 4 main SARS-CoV-2 targets: Mpro, nsp16/nsp10 complex, ACE2-PD and RBD-S-protein via molecular docking. Docking results indicated that the nsp16/nsp10 complex has the best binding affinities where the strongest binding was detected with apigenin-7-O-rutinoside, prunin and acaciin with -9.4, -9.3 and -9.3 kcal/mol binding energy, respectively, compared to the control (SAM) with -8.2 kcal/mol. Furthermore, the stability of these complexes was studied using molecular dynamics of 150 ns, which were then compared to their complexes in the other three targets. MM-PBSA calculations suggested the high stability of acaciin-nsp16 complex with binding energy of -110 kJ/mol.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to develop and validate a computable phenotype for COVID-19 severity. METHODS: Twelve 4CE sites participated. First we developed an EHR-based severity phenotype consisting of six code classes, and we validated it on patient hospitalization data from the 12 4CE clinical sites against the outcomes of ICU admission and/or death. We also piloted an alternative machine-learning approach and compared selected predictors of severity to the 4CE phenotype at one site. RESULTS: The full 4CE severity phenotype had pooled sensitivity of 0.73 and specificity 0.83 for the combined outcome of ICU admission and/or death. The sensitivity of individual code categories for acuity had high variability - up to 0.65 across sites. At one pilot site, the expert-derived phenotype had mean AUC 0.903 (95% CI: 0.886, 0.921), compared to AUC 0.956 (95% CI: 0.952, 0.959) for the machine-learning approach. Billing codes were poor proxies of ICU admission, with as low as 49% precision and recall compared to chart review. DISCUSSION: We developed a severity phenotype using 6 code classes that proved resilient to coding variability across international institutions. In contrast, machine-learning approaches may overfit hospital-specific orders. Manual chart review revealed discrepancies even in the gold-standard outcomes, possibly due to heterogeneous pandemic conditions. CONCLUSION: We developed an EHR-based severity phenotype for COVID-19 in hospitalized patients and validated it at 12 international sites.","Klann, Jeffrey G; Weber, Griffin M; Estiri, Hossein; Moal, Bertrand; Avillach, Paul; Hong, Chuan; Castro, Victor; Maulhardt, Thomas; Tan, Amelia L M; Geva, Alon; Beaulieu-Jones, Brett K; Malovini, Alberto; South, Andrew M; Visweswaran, Shyam; Omenn, Gilbert S; Ngiam, Kee Yuan; Mandl, Kenneth D; Boeker, Martin; Olson, Karen L; Mowery, Danielle L; Morris, Michele; Follett, Robert W; Hanauer, David A; Bellazzi, Riccardo; Moore, Jason H; Loh, Ne-Hooi Will; Bell, Douglas S; Wagholikar, Kavishwar B; Chiovato, Luca; Tibollo, Valentina; Rieg, Siegbert; Li, Anthony L L J; Jouhet, Vianney; Schriver, Emily; Samayamuthu, Malarkodi J; Xia, Zongqi; Hutch, Meghan; Luo, Yuan; Kohane, Isaac S; Brat, Gabriel A; Murphy, Shawn N",J. am. med. inform. assoc,350,1

This paper proposes a Multimodal Consistency Neural Network (MCNN) that considers the consistency of multimodal data and captures the overall characteristics of social media information. Our method consists of five subnetworks: the text feature extraction module, the visual semantic feature extraction module, the visual tampering feature extraction module, the similarity measurement module, and the multimodal fusion module. The text feature extraction module and the visual semantic feature extraction module are responsible for extracting the semantic features of text and vision and mapping them to the same space for a common representation of cross-modal features. The visual tampering feature extraction module is responsible for extracting visual physical and tamper features. The similarity measurement module can directly measure the similarity of multimodal data for the problem of mismatching of image and text. We assess the constructed method in terms of four datasets commonly used for fake news detection. The accuracy of the detection is improved clearly compared to the best available methods.","Xue, Junxiao Wang Yabo Tian Yichen Li Yafei Shi Lei Wei Lin",Information Processing &amp; Management,350,26

However, the advancement in medical science has made it possible to identify that the novel infectious agent is from the coronavirus family. Rapid genome sequencing by various groups helped in identifying the structure and function of the virus, its immunogenicity in diverse populations, and potential preventive measures. Coronavirus attacks the respiratory system, causing pneumonia and lymphopenia in infected individuals. Viral components like spike and nucleocapsid proteins trigger an immune response in the host to eliminate the virus. These viral antigens can be either recognized by the B cells or presented by MHC complexes to the T cells, resulting in antibody production, increased cytokine secretion, and cytolytic activity in the acute phase of infection. Genetic polymorphism in MHC enables it to present some of the T cell epitopes very well over the other MHC alleles. The association of MHC alleles and its downregulated expression has been correlated with disease severity against influenza and coronaviruses. Studies have reported that infected individuals can, after recovery, induce strong protective responses by generating a memory T-cell pool against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. These memory T cells were not persistent in the long term and, upon reactivation, caused local damage due to cross-reactivity. So far, the reports suggest that SARS-CoV-2, which is highly contagious, shows related symptoms in three different stages and develops an exhaustive T-cell pool at higher loads of viral infection. As there are no specific treatments available for this novel coronavirus, numerous small molecular drugs that are being used for the treatment of diseases like SARS, MERS, HIV, ebola, malaria, and tuberculosis are being given to COVID-19 patients, and clinical trials for many such drugs have already begun. A classical immunotherapy of convalescent plasma transfusion from recovered patients has also been initiated for the neutralization of viremia in terminally ill COVID-19 patients. Due to the limitations of plasma transfusion, researchers are now focusing on developing neutralizing antibodies against virus particles along with immuno-modulation of cytokines like IL-6, Type I interferons (IFNs), and TNF-&#945; that could help in combating the infection. This review highlights the similarities of the coronaviruses that caused SARS and MERS to the novel SARS-CoV-2 in relation to their pathogenicity and immunogenicity and also focuses on various treatment strategies that could be employed for curing COVID-19.","Shah, Vibhuti Kumar; Firmal, Priyanka; Alam, Aftab; Ganguly, Dipyaman; Chattopadhyay, Samit",Front Immunol,350,32

In particular, it has highlighted the gap between the lofty promises of digital welfare by political leaders and businesses, and the widespread discontent with digitalization as evident on the ground. In this paper, I take this gap as a starting point to conceptualize the nature of politics in the data state, drawing on Polanyian themes to understand how the contentions are gradually “embedding” the digital economy in society. Tracing the arc of the interactions between domestic ideas, interests and institutions alongside the development of digital capitalism, I also show that caught in these entanglements, digital economy can no longer remain a one-way street for data “extraction”. More specifically, I argue that at the end of its first decade of since the emergence of surveillance capitalism in 2010s, politics has ensured that it confronts ground level resistance that revolves around themes of inclusion, welfare and pluralism rather than the liberal conceptions of privacy and individual consent. © 2021 Taylor & Francis.","Khan, A.",India Review,350,24

We investigate UK cardiac surgery outcomes during the early phase of the Covid-19 pandemic. METHODS: This retrospective observational study included all adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery between 1st March and 30th April 2020 in nine UK centres. Data was obtained and linked locally from the National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research Adult Cardiac Surgery database, the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre database and local electronic systems. The anonymised datasets were analysed by the lead centre. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics, propensity score matching (PSM), conditional logistic regression and hierarchical quantile regression. RESULTS: Of 755 included individuals, 53 (7.0%) had Covid-19. Comparing those with and without Covid-19, those with Covid-19 had increased mortality (24.5% v 3.5%, p < 0.0001) and longer post-operative stay (11 days v 6 days, p = 0.001), both of which remained significant after PSM. Patients with a pre-operative Covid-19 diagnosis recovered in a similar way to non-Covid-19 patients. However, those with a post-operative Covid-19 diagnosis remained in hospital for an additional 5 days (12 days v 7 days, p = 0.024) and had a considerably higher mortality rate compared to those with a pre-operative diagnosis (37.1% v 0.0%, p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: To mitigate against the risks of Covid-19, particularly the post-operative burden, robust and effective pre-surgery diagnosis protocols alongside effective strategies to maintain a Covid-19 free environment are needed. Dedicated cardiac surgery hubs could be valuable in achieving safe and continual delivery of cardiac surgery.","Sanders, Julie; Akowuah, Enoch; Cooper, Jackie; Kirmani, Bilal H; Kanani, Mazyar; Acharya, Metesh; Jeganathan, Reuben; Krasopoulos, George; Ngaage, Dumbor; Deglurkar, Indu; Yiu, Patrick; Kendall, Simon; Oo, Aung Ye",J Cardiothorac Surg,350,13

METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study conducted from March to November 2020 in a tertiary children's hospital. Patients were identified by International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision codes and included if age was younger than 90 days, a SARS-CoV-2 test was performed, and at least 1 bacterial culture was collected. Positive cases of SARS-CoV-2 were age- and sex-matched to negative controls for analysis. Serious bacterial infection was defined as a urinary tract infection, bacterial enteritis, bacteremia, and/or bacterial meningitis. RESULTS: Fifty-three SARS-CoV-2-positive infants were identified with a higher rate of respiratory symptoms and lower white blood cell and C-reactive protein values than their SARS-CoV-2 matched controls. The rate of SBI in the SARS-CoV-2-positive infants was 8% compared with 34% in the controls; the most common infections were urinary tract infections (6% vs 23%). There were no cases of bacteremia or bacterial meningitis in the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) infants and 2 (4%) cases of bacteremia in the controls. The relative risk of any SBI between the 2 groups was 0.22 (95% confidence interval, 0.1-0.6; P &#8804; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that febrile infants younger than 90 days with COVID-19 have lower rates of SBI than their matched SARS-CoV-2-negative controls. These data are consistent with previous studies describing lower risks of SBI in febrile infants with concomitant viral respiratory tract infections.","Payson, Alison; Etinger, Veronica; Napky, Pablo; Montarroyos, Stephanie; Ruiz-Castaneda, Ana; Mestre, Marcos",Pediatr Emerg Care,350,16

The sequence of Chinese white pear genome (cv. 'Dangshansuli') along with the seven other species of Rosaceae has already been reported. Although, in these fruit crops, there is still a lack of clarity regarding the LYP family genes and their evolutionary history. RESULTS: In the existing study, eight Rosaceae species i.e., Pyrus communis, Prunus persica, Fragaria vesca, Pyrus bretschneideri, Prunus avium, Prunus mume, Rubus occidentalis, and Malus × domestica were evaluated. Here, we determined a total of 124 LYP genes from the underlined Rosaceae species. While eighteen of the genes were from Chinese white pear, named as PbrLYPs. According to the LYPs structural characteristics and their phylogenetic analysis, those genes were classified into eight groups (group LYK1, LYK2, LYK3, LYK4/5, LYM1/3, LYM2, NFP, and WAKL). Dispersed duplication and whole-genome duplication (WGD) were found to be the most contributing factors of LYP family expansion in the Rosaceae species. More than half of the duplicated PbrLYP gene pairs were dated back to the ancient WGD (~ 140 million years ago (MYA)), and PbrLYP genes have experienced long-term purifying selection. The transcriptomic results indicated that the PbrLYP genes expression was tissue-specific. Most PbrLYP genes showed differential expression in leaves under fungal pathogen infection with two of them located in the plasmalemma. CONCLUSION: A comprehensive analysis identified 124 LYP genes in eight Rosaceae species. Our findings have provided insights into the functions and characteristics of the Rosaceae LYP genes and a guide for the identification of other candidate LYPs for further genetic improvements for pathogen-resistance in higher plants.","Chen, Qiming; Li, Qionghou; Qiao, Xin; Yin, Hao; Zhang, Shaoling",BMC Genomics,350,1

This study aimed to assess the challenges faced by women who used RMNCH services in Nigeria's epicentre, their satisfaction with care received during the COVID-19 pandemic and the factors associated with their satisfaction. METHODS: This cross-sectional survey was conducted in Lagos, southwest Nigeria among 1,241 women of reproductive age who had just received RMNCH services at one of twenty-two health facilities across the primary, secondary and tertiary tiers of health care. The respondents were selected via multi-stage sampling and face to face exit interviews were conducted by trained interviewers. Client satisfaction was assessed across four sub-scales: health care delivery, health facility, interpersonal aspects of care and access to services. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess the relationship between personal characteristics and client satisfaction. RESULTS: About 43.51% of respondents had at least one challenge in accessing RMNCH services since the COVID-19 outbreak. Close to a third (31.91%) could not access service because they could not leave their houses during the lockdown and 18.13% could not access service because there was no transportation. The mean clients' satisfaction score among the respondents was 43.25 (SD: 6.28) out of a possible score of 57. Satisfaction scores for the interpersonal aspects of care were statistically significantly lower in the PHCs and general hospitals compared to teaching hospitals. Being over 30 years of age was significantly associated with an increased clients' satisfaction score (ß = 1.80, 95%CI: 1.10-2.50). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 lockdown posed challenges to accessing RMNCH services for a significant proportion of women surveyed. Although overall satisfaction with care was fairly high, there is a need to provide tailored COVID-19 sensitive inter-personal care to clients at all levels of care.","Balogun, Mobolanle; Banke-Thomas, Aduragbemi; Sekoni, Adekemi; Boateng, Godfred O; Yesufu, Victoria; Wright, Ololade; Ubani, Osinachi; Abayomi, Akin; Afolabi, Bosede B; Ogunsola, Folasade",PLoS One,350,24

We also look at a number of variables linked to the spread of the virus to determine the factors affecting the growth of new confirmed cases. We show evidence that countries in Europe are more likely to impose a national lockdown than any other continent. For the empirical analysis, we undertake the cross-sectional regression model, logistic regression model and logistic growth curve as a method to apply the data collected over the period March to June 2020 as this is the data available at the time this paper is composed. The empirical results of this paper indicate that countries which impose the strictest form of lockdown will result in a reduction in growth of new confirmed cases.","Hwang, Dr Tienyu",Technological Forecasting and Social Change,350,20

No primeiro estudo foram utilizados 37 animais de um a onze anos de idade expostos ao sobrepeso e avaliados por exame radiográfico das articulações do tarso de ambos membros pélvicos para diagnosticar a prevalência de osteoartrite nessas articulações. Em um segundo estudo, foram utilizadas 28 éguas em sobrepeso no terço final de gestação e seus potros, do nascimento aos seis meses de idade. Foram avaliadas medidas biométricas e metabólicas das éguas e potros e, aos seis meses de vida, foi realizado exame radiográfico das articulações do tarso de ambos membros pélvicos dos potros para diagnosticar a incidência de osteoartrite nas articulações desta e das articulações metacarpo-falangeana de ambos membros torácicos para avaliação da linha fisária do 3º osso metacarpiano desta população de animais jovens.

Underlying factors, including Social Determinants of Health (SDoH), could contribute to these statistics. Our prior work has explored associations between SDoH and several adverse health outcomes (eg, asthma and obesity). Our findings reinforce the emerging consensus that SDoH factors should be considered when implementing intelligent public health surveillance solutions to inform public health policies and interventions. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to redefine the Healthy People 2030's SDoH taxonomy to accommodate the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, we aim to provide a blueprint and implement a prototype for the Urban Population Health Observatory (UPHO), a web-based platform that integrates classified group-level SDoH indicators to individual- and aggregate-level population health data. METHODS: The process of building the UPHO involves collecting and integrating data from several sources, classifying the collected data into drivers and outcomes, incorporating data science techniques for calculating measurable indicators from the raw variables, and studying the extent to which interventions are identified or developed to mitigate drivers that lead to the undesired outcomes. RESULTS: We generated and classified the indicators of social determinants of health, which are linked to COVID-19. To display the functionalities of the UPHO platform, we presented a prototype design to demonstrate its features. We provided a use case scenario for 4 different users. CONCLUSIONS: UPHO serves as an apparatus for implementing effective interventions and can be adopted as a global platform for chronic and infectious diseases. The UPHO surveillance platform provides a novel approach and novel insights into immediate and long-term health policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and other future public health crises. The UPHO assists public health organizations and policymakers in their efforts in reducing health disparities, achieving health equity, and improving urban population health.","Brakefield, Whitney S; Ammar, Nariman; Olusanya, Olufunto A; Shaban-Nejad, Arash",JMIR Public Health Surveill,350,10

The UK Government implemented the biggest lockdown of society during peacetime in British history at the end of March 2020, aiming to contain the rapid spread of the virus. The UK lockdown was maintained for 7 weeks, but the effectiveness of the control measures in suppressing disease transmission remains incompletely understood. METHODS: A Bayesian SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infected-removed) epidemiological model was used to rebuild the local transmission dynamics of the spread of COVID-19 in nine regions of England. RESULTS: The basic reproduction number (R0) in England was found to be relatively high compared with China. The estimate of the temporally varying effective reproduction number (Rt) suggests that the control measures, especially the forced lockdown, were effective to reduce transmissibility and curb the COVID-19 epidemic. Although the overall incidence rate in the UK has declined, forecasting highlights the possibility of a second epidemic wave in several regions. CONCLUSION: This study enhances understanding of the current outbreak and the effectiveness of control measures in the UK.","Liu, Yang; Tang, Julian W; Lam, Tommy T Y",Int J Infect Dis,350,1

A possible explanation could be molecular mimicry between SARS-CoV-2 and human proteins. Peptide sharing has been found between antigenic epitopes of this virus and heat shock proteins (Hsp) 60 and 90, both of which are associated with autoimmune diseases including those of the bullous type. In particular, there is evidence for the latter Hsp acting as a pathophysiological factor and treatment target in autoimmune blistering dermatoses. Considering multimodal anti-inflammatory mechanisms of action of anti-Hsp90 treatment and drug repositioning results, it may be hypothesized that Hsp90 inhibition could also be a treatment option for cytokine storm-mediated acute respiratory distress syndrome in Covid-19 patients. Hence, although Covid-19-induced autoimmune bullous diseases have not been described in the literature so far, the potential relationship between Covid-19, Hsp, and these autoimmune disorders deserves further attention with respect to both pathophysiology and treatment.","Kasperkiewicz, Michael",Cell stress chaperones,350,16

Some studies show that up to half of the events are diagnosed early after admission. OBJECTIVES: To study symptomatic VTE incidence in acute COVID-19 hospitalized patients and to describe timing of VTE diagnosis. METHODS: Multicenter cohort of 5966 patients hospitalized with acute COVID-19. Multicenter Registry of 844 hospitalized patients with acute COVID-19 and associated acute VTE. RESULTS: By the time of cohort data collection, 68 patients (1.14%) were still hospitalized, 19.8% had died, and 5.4% required ICU. During a median follow-up of 6 days (IQR, 4-12), 183 patients (3.07%; 95% CI, 2.64-3.55) presented a symptomatic VTE event.

First identified in an outbreak in Wuhan, China, COVID-19 is affecting more than 185 countries and territories around the world, with more than 15,754,651 confirmed cases and more than 640,029 deaths. Since December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 transmission has become a global threat, which includes confirmed cases in all 50 states within the United States (US). As of 25 July 2020, the Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering Center for Systems Science and Engineering reports more than 4,112,651 cases and 145,546 deaths. To date, health disparities are associated with COVID-19 mortality among underserved populations. Here, the author explores potential underlying reasons for reported disproportionate, increased risks of mortality among African Americans and Hispanics/Latinos with COVID-19 compared with non-Hispanic Whites. The author examines the underlying clinical implications that may predispose minority populations and the adverse clinical outcomes that may contribute to increased risk of mortality. Government and community-based strategies to safeguard minority populations at risk for increased morbidity and mortality are essential. Underserved populations living in poverty with limited access to social services across the US are more likely to have underlying medical conditions and are among the most vulnerable. Societal and cultural barriers for ethnic minorities to achieve health equity are systemic issues that may be addressed only through shifts in governmental policies, producing long-overdue, substantive changes to end health care inequities.","Alcendor, Donald J.",J.

Willingness to be vaccinated differed by age (p < 0.001), by race and ethnicity (p < 0.001) and by level of education (p < 0.001). Willingness generally increased with age and education. Asians were most willing to be vaccinated, followed by non-Hispanic Whites, Hispanics, and non-Hispanic Blacks (p < 0.001). Occupational groups differed in willingness (p < 0.001). Retired and students were more willing than all others (p < 0.001) followed by disabled or unemployed, healthcare workers, and educators. First Responders were least willing to be vaccinated (p < 0.001) followed by construction, maintenance and landscaping, homemakers, housekeeping, cleaning and janitorial workers, and retail and food service. The strongest predictor of willingness was confidence with the safety of the vaccine (r = 0.723, p < 0.001), followed by concern with protecting others by being vaccinated (r = 0.574, p < 0.001), and believing COVID-19 was serious enough to merit vaccination (r = 0.478, p < 0.00).

METHODS: A bidirectional prospective study. Interviews investigated symptoms potentially associated with COVID-19 6 months after the disease onset of all consecutive adult inpatients and outpatients with COVID-19 attending Udine Hospital (Italy) from March to May 2020. IgG antibodies against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were also evaluated 6 months after the onset of symptoms, at the time of the interview. RESULTS: A total of 599 individuals were included (320 female, 53.4%; mean age 53 years, SD 15.8) and interviewed 187 days (22 SD) after onset. The prevalence of post-COVID-19 syndrome was 40.2% (241/599).

The RECOVERY (Randomised Trials in COVID-19 Therapy) trial provided data on the mortality benefits of corticosteroids. The study aimed to determine the association between corticosteroid use on mortality and infection rates and to define subgroups who may benefit from corticosteroids in a real-world setting. METHODS: Clinical data were extracted that included demographic, laboratory data and details of the therapy, including the administration of corticosteroids, azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab and anticoagulation. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included intensive care unit (ICU) admission and invasive mechanical ventilation. Outcomes were compared in patients who did and did not receive corticosteroids using the multivariate Cox regression model. RESULTS: 4313 patients were hospitalised with COVID-19 during the study period, of whom 1270 died (29.4%). When administered within the first 7 days after admission, corticosteroids were associated with reduced mortality (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.97, p=0.03) and decreased transfers to the ICU (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.11, p=0.02).

Neighboring cities in Hubei Province followed suit with the government enforcing social distancing measures to restrict the spread of the disease throughout the province. Few studies have examined the emotional attitudes of citizens as expressed on social media toward the imposed social distancing measures and the factors that affected their emotions. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was twofold. First, we aimed to detect the emotional attitudes of different groups of users on Sina Weibo toward the social distancing measures imposed by the People's Government of Hubei Province. Second, the influencing factors of their emotions, as well as the impact of the imposed measures on users' emotions, was studied. METHODS: Sina Weibo, one of China's largest social media platforms, was chosen as the primary data source. The time span of selected data was from January 21, 2020, to March 24, 2020, while analysis was completed in late June 2020. Bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) was used to analyze users' emotions, while logistic regression analysis was employed to explore the influence of explanatory variables on users' emotions, such as age and spatial location. Further, the moderating effects of social distancing measures on the relationship between user characteristics and users' emotions were assessed by observing the interaction effects between the measures and explanatory variables. RESULTS: Based on the 63,169 comments obtained, we identified six topics of discussion-(1) delaying the resumption of work and school, (2) travel restrictions, (3) traffic restrictions, (4) extending the Lunar New Year holiday, (5) closing public spaces, and (6) community containment. There was no multicollinearity in the data during statistical analysis; the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit was 0.24 (&#967;28=10.34, P>.24). The main emotions shown by citizens were negative, including anger and fear. Users located in Hubei Province showed the highest amount of negative emotions in Mainland China. There are statistically significant differences in the distribution of emotional polarity between social distancing measures (&#967;220=19,084.73, P<.001), as well as emotional polarity between genders (&#967;24=1784.59, P<.001) and emotional polarity between spatial locations (&#967;24=1659.67, P<.001). Compared with other types of social distancing measures, the measures of delaying the resumption of work and school or travel restrictions mainly had a positive moderating effect on public emotion, while traffic restrictions or community containment had a negative moderating effect on public emotion. CONCLUSIONS: Findings provide a reference point for the adoption of epidemic prevention and control measures, and are considered helpful for government agencies to take timely actions to alleviate negative emotions during public health emergencies.","Shen, Lining; Yao, Rui; Zhang, Wenli; Evans, Richard; Cao, Guang; Zhang, Zhiguo",JMIR Med Inform,350,4

However, persons at greatest risk for poor mental health outcomes, such as people with serious mental illness, have been largely overlooked. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents the protocol for a study that aims to examine the mental health impact of COVID-19 and social distancing behaviors in people with serious mental illness and the behaviors undertaken to prevent COVID-19 infection in this group. METHODS: Participants will include individuals with serious mental illness (eg, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder) and nonpsychiatric control participants who are currently participating in or have previously participated in several ongoing parent observational studies. Data will be collected from April 2020 through August 2020. Participants will complete phone interviews at 2 time points to assess their current emotional functioning and discuss the measures they have taken to prevent COVID-19 infection. Baseline (pre-COVID-19) mental health, sampled by ecological momentary assessment over an extended period, will be compared with current mental health, also sampled by ecological momentary assessment over an extended period. Demographic, cognitive, and psychosocial factors at baseline will be used to examine risk and resilience to current mental health and coping. RESULTS: The inclusion of participants for the first round of telephone assessments started on April 3, 2020 and will be completed by May 31, 2020. As of April 30, 2020, 101 individuals had completed these first-round assessments. The second round of telephone assessments will likely occur between June 1, 2020, and August 31, 2020. Study results will be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings will have broad implications for understanding the psychological consequences of COVID-19 among vulnerable persons with serious mental illness and will provide the opportunity to identify targets to reduce negative outcomes in the future. We also hope our efforts will provide a roadmap and resources for other researchers who would like to implement a similar approach.

First, it explores the factors that shape governments' willingness to support airlines.

Second, it analyses the implications of government support in three dimensions relevant to air transport policy: competition and liberalisation, airline ownership and control, and environmental sustainability. The analysis suggests that most governments give a high priority to maintaining air transport connectivity in order to protect economic activity and jobs, in aviation itself and in related sectors such as tourism. The trade-off between ensuring connectivity and maintaining competition after the COVID-19 pandemic is a challenge with several political and economic dimensions. The re-orientation of public policy in the aftermath of the pandemic may limit the relative importance of the policy priorities that shaped the evolution of the air transport sector before the crisis, especially those related to climate change and the environment.

We aim to report our initial experience since establishing our MSU, the first unit in the Tri-state area, and assess its impact on the stroke standards of care timeline. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database of all MSU dispatched cases from August 2019 to March 2020. RESULTS: Of 195 MSU responses, 101 were treated and transported by the MSU. The mean time (hr:mm) of dispatch to scene arrival was 0:07+0:03, scene arrival to CT start was 0:10+0:03, CT start to teleneuro start was 0:05+0:03, teleneuro start to scene departure was 0:06+0:05, scene departure to hospital arrival was 0:12+0:06, and hospital arrival to arterial puncture was 2:59+1:01.

For this reason, we investigated risk perception in 514 people over 60 years during the lockdown. We administered a structured interview collecting socio-demographic information, sources of information used, actions undertaken to avoid contagion, and risk perception. Risk perception related to COVID-19 was significantly lower than the perceived risk associated with other threats, and it was correlated to the number of sources of information used but not to the actions undertaken. Furthermore, we found higher risk perception in who knew infected persons, and a negative correlation between the risk perception and age, with the over 75 perceiving a lower risk of getting infected compared to the younger participants. Our results should be taken as informative for future studies. Indeed, further studies on the older adults and the risk perception during emergencies are needed to better orient both communication and supporting strategies.","Guastafierro, Erika; Toppo, Claudia; Magnani, Francesca G; Romano, Rosa; Facchini, Carla; Campioni, Rino; Brambilla, Ersilia; Leonardi, Matilde",J Gerontol Soc Work,350,29

MATERIALS AND METHODS: ENMGs performed for evaluation of diffuse weakness in patients who could not be discharged from semi-intensive care COVID unit because of difficulties in ventilation weaning were reviewed. Patients with severe COVID-19 infection who had undergone endotracheal intubation and able to co-operate were considered. ENMG protocol was focused on neurophysiological items that excluded or confirmed critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP), myopathy (CIM), or polyneuromyopathy (CIPM). Standardized clinical evaluation was performed using Medical Research Council (MRC) sum score. RESULTS: Eight patients were included in the study. All presented known risk factors for intensive care unit-acquired weakness (ICU-AW), and none of them had history of underlying neuromuscular disorders. ENMG findings were normal in two patients, while only two patients had an altered MRC sum score (< 48). Neuromuscular involvement was diagnosed in 6/8 patients (75%): 2 had CIP, 1 had possible CIM, 1 had CIPM, while 1 patient, with clinically evident weakness but equivocal ENMG findings, was classified as ICU-AW. Finally, 1 patient was diagnosed with acute demyelinating neuropathy. Patients with neuromuscular involvement were those with longer intubation duration and higher levels of IL-6 at admission. CONCLUSION: Neuromuscular complications are frequent in severe COVID-19 and cannot be excluded by MRC sum scores above 48. Standardized ENMG is helpful in guiding diagnosis when clinical evaluation is not reliable or possible. Elevated IL-6 at admission may be a predictor biomarker of ICU-AW in COVID-19.","Bax, Francesco; Lettieri, Christian; Marini, Alessandro; Pellitteri, Gaia; Surcinelli, Andrea; Valente, Mariarosaria; Budai, Riccardo; Patruno, Vincenzo; Gigli, Gian Luigi",Neurol. sci,350,8

We have aimed to investigate the state of mental health of the Argentine population and the behaviours adopted to cope with mental distress during quarantine. Method: An online survey was conducted using a probabilistic sampling technique and stratifiedaccording to the geographic regions of the country. The survey covered days 7-11 (n = 2,631) and days 50-55 (n = 2,068) after compulsory quarantine. The psychological impact was measured using the 27-item Symptom CheckList (SCL-27), which provides a Global Severity Index (GSI). An ad hoc questionnaire registered problematic, healthy and other behaviours. Two network models were estimated using a Mixed Graphical Model. Data from the two periods were compared and analysed. Outcomes: Higher GSI scores and greater risk of experiencing mental disorder were found in Period 2 as compared with Period 1. The lowest GSI scores were associated with physical activity in both periods, and meditation and yoga in Period 1. Drug users reported the highest GSI scores in both periods. The Network Comparison Test confirmeda significantchange in symptomatology structure over the two quarantine periods. Conclusion: This study showed that psychological symptoms and the risk of experiencing mental disorder increased significantlyfrom Period 1 to Period 2. Network analysis suggested that the quarantine might have brought about changes in the relationships between symptoms.

Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) hospitalisation is a potentially traumatic experience, especially in severe cases. Furthermore, the unprecedented context of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic, with daily media bombardment about COVID-19 mortality, may have amplified life-threatening perception also in patients with moderate infection. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and risk factors of PTSD at 3-month follow-up in patients hospitalised for COVID-19 infection. DESIGN: In this cohort follow-up study conducted in a large Italian academic COVID-19 hospital, 115 recruited survivors were contacted by telephone 3 months after discharge to home care. The Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 was administered. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to analyse risk factors for the development of PTSD. KEY RESULTS: A total of 10.4% of the sample received a PCL-5-based diagnosis of PTSD. Other 8.6% of the sample received a diagnosis of subthreshold PTSD, which leads to significant levels of distress and impairment. Multivariate regression analysis indicated that previous psychiatric diagnosis (odds ratio (OR) = 6.3, 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.7-78.6, p < 0.001) and obesity (OR = 3.51, 95% CI: 1.4-857.9, p = 0.03) were risk factors for developing PTSD. Chronic pulmonary diseases approached significance as a risk factor (OR = 6.03, 95% CI: 1.0-37.1, p = 0.053). Male sex was a protective factor (OR=0.04, 95% CI: 0.0-0.041, p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: PTSD and subthreshold PTSD rates in patients hospitalised for COVID-19 are worrying. Female sex and pre-existing mental disorders are established risk factors for PTSD, while the prospective association with obesity needs further investigation. Clinicians treating COVID-19 should consider screening for PTSD at follow-up assessments in patients discharged from the hospital.","Tarsitani, Lorenzo; Vassalini, Paolo; Koukopoulos, Alexia; Borrazzo, Cristian; Alessi, Federica; Di Nicolantonio, Chiara; Serra, Riccardo; Alessandri, Francesco; Ceccarelli, Giancarlo; Mastroianni, Claudio Maria; d039,; Ettorre, Gabriella",J. gen. intern. med,350,16

Recently, recommendations had been made regarding the urgent need of reorganizing head and neck cancer diagnostic services to provide a safe work environment for the staff. A total of 162 glass slides from 109 patients over a period of 5 weeks were included in this validation and were assessed by all pathologists in both analyses (digital and conventional) to allow intraobserver comparison. The intraobserver agreement between the digital method (DM) and conventional method (CM) was considered almost perfect (&#954; ranged from 0.85 to 0.98, with 95% CI, ranging from 0.81 to 1). The most significant and frequent disagreements within trainees encompassed epithelial dysplasia grading and differentiation among severe dysplasia (carcinoma in situ) and oral squamous cell carcinoma. The most frequent pitfall from DM was lag in screen mirroring. The lack of details of inflammatory cells and the need for a higher magnification to assess dysplasia were pointed in one case each. The COVID-19 crisis has accelerated and consolidated the use of online meeting tools, which would be a valuable resource even in the post-pandemic scenario. Adaptation in laboratory workflow, the advent of digital pathology and remote reporting can mitigate the impact of similar future disruptions to the oral and maxillofacial pathology laboratory workflow avoiding delays in diagnosis and report, to facilitate timely management of head and neck cancer patients.

How did principals respond? What were the emergent leadership practices? For this case study, we used a purposeful, maximum variation sample of nine principals in Florida We sought balance in gender, race and ethnicity, and grade level In-depth interviews were conducted using a structured protocol Analysis treated each principal as an individual case, then cross-case thematic analysis was employed to uncover common patterns and themes Three findings emerged First, participants drew upon their individual reservoirs of shared leader qualities, including personalized and pragmatic communicator;leading with flexibility, creativity and care;bending rules and shifting priorities;and showing resilience under pressure Second, they tapped into their schools’ strengths, including school context and in-house expertise Third, they made inter-school connections The first phase of the compound crisis pushed principals to prioritize care, safety, and wellbeing of students, teachers, and communities above accountability measures and systemic institutional constraints A call to action for equity is the next logical step for system consideration, and was echoed by participating principals, as well as a realization that going back to old ways is no longer an option © Copyright © 2021 Reyes-Guerra, Maslin-Ostrowski, Barakat and Stefanovic","Reyes-Guerra, D.; Maslin-Ostrowski, P.; Barakat, M.

It has been associated with high mortality and morbidity all over the world. COVID-19 can cause a significant inflammatory response leading to coagulopathy and this hypercoagulable state has been associated with worse clinical outcomes in these patients. The published data regarding the presence of lupus anticoagulant in critically ill COVID-19-positive patients is limited and indicates varying conclusions so far. CASE REPORT Here, we present a case of a 31-year-old man who was admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 pneumonia, complicated with superadded bacterial empyema and required video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery with decortication. This patient also had prolonged prothrombin time on preoperative labs, which was not corrected with mixing study. Further workup detected positive lupus anticoagulant and anti-cardiolipin IgM along with alteration in other coagulation factor levels. The patient was treated with fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K before surgical intervention. He had an uneventful surgical course. He received prophylactic-dose low molecular weight heparin for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis and did not experience any thrombotic events while hospitalized. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 infection creates a prothrombotic state in affected patients. The formation of micro-thrombotic emboli results in significantly increased mortality and morbidity. Routine anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin can prevent thrombotic events and thus can improve patient outcomes. In patients with elevated prothrombin time, lupus anticoagulant/anti-cardiolipin antibody-positivity should be suspected, and anticoagulation prophylaxis should be continued perioperatively for better outcomes.","Yarlagadda, Keerthi; Mi, Kaihong; Sendil, Selin; Koons, Connie L; Komanduri, Saketram; Cinicola, John T",Am J Case Rep,350,30

To reduce the impact of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, the Italian Government decision-makers issued a series of law decrees that imposed measures limiting social contacts, stopped non-essential production activities, and restructured public health care in order to privilege assistance to patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Health care services were substantially limited including planned hospitalization and elective surgeries. These substantial measures were criticized due to their impact on individual rights including freedom and autonomy, but were justified by the awareness that hospitals would have been unable to cope with the surge of infected people who needed treatment for COVID-19. The imbalance between the need to guarantee ordinary care and to deal with the pandemic, in a context of limited health resources, raises ethical concerns as well as clinical management issues. The emergency scenario caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in the lockdown phase, led the Government and health care decision-makers to prioritize community safety above the individuals' rights. This new community-centered approach to clinical care has created tension among the practitioners and exposed health workers to malpractice claims. Reducing the morbidity and mortality rates of the COVID-19 pandemic is the priority of every government, but the legitimate question remains whether the policy that supports this measure could be less harmful for the health care system.","Ferorelli, Davide; Mandarelli, Gabriele; Solarino, Biagio",Medicina (Kaunas),350,21

The impact of the pandemic is inevitably not limited to patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and their outcomes; however, the impact of COVID-19 on intensive care has not yet been analyzed. METHODS: The objective of this propensity score-matched study was to compare the clinical outcomes of non-COVID-19 critically ill patients with the outcomes of prepandemic patients. Critically ill, non-COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) during the first wave of the pandemic were matched with patients admitted in the previous year. Mortality, length of stay, and rate of readmission were compared between the two groups after matching. RESULTS: A total of 211 critically ill SARS-CoV­2 negative patients admitted between 13 March 2020 and 16 May 2020 were matched to 211 controls, selected from a matching pool of 1421 eligible patients admitted to the ICU in 2019. After matching, the outcomes were not significantly different between the two groups: ICU mortality was 5.2% in 2019 and 8.5% in 2020, pâ¯= 0.248, while intrahospital mortality was 10.9% in 2019 and 14.2% in 2020, pâ¯= 0.378. The median ICU length of stay was similar in 2019: 4 days (IQR 2-6) compared to 2020: 4 days (IQR 2-7), pâ¯= 0.196. The rate of ICU readmission was 15.6% in 2019 and 10.9% in 2020, pâ¯= 0.344. CONCLUSION: In this retrospective single center study, mortality, ICU length of stay, and rate of ICU readmission did not differ significantly between patients admitted to the ICU during the implementation of hospital-wide COVID-19 contingency planning and patients admitted to the ICU before the pandemic.","Bologheanu, Razvan; Maleczek, Mathias; Laxar, Daniel; Kimberger, Oliver",Wien. klin.

It is therefore urgent to evaluate the efficiency of infection prevention and control (IPC) measures in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission. METHODS: We analysed the COVID-19 outbreaks that took place between March and May 2020 in 12 ACFs using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using maximum-likelihood approaches and generalized linear mixed models, we analysed the proportion of infected residents in ACFs and identified covariates associated with the proportion of infected residents. RESULTS: The secondary-attack risk was estimated at 4.1%, suggesting a high efficiency of the IPC measures implemented in the region. Mask wearing and the establishment of COVID-19 zones for infected residents were the two main covariates associated with lower secondary-attack risks. CONCLUSIONS: Wearing masks and isolating potentially infected residents appear to be associated with a more limited spread of SARS-CoV-2 in ACFs.","Reyné, Bastien; Selinger, Christian; Sofonea, Mircea T; Miot, Stéphanie; Pisoni, Amandine; Tuaillon, Edouard; Bousquet, Jean; Blain, Hubert; Alizon, Samuel",Int. j. epidemiol,350,11

In most cases, olfactory dysfunction is accompanied by reduced sense of taste, is partial (microsmia) and seems to normalize after several weeks, however, especially in cases of virus-induced complete smell loss (anosmia), there are indications of persisting deficits even 2 months after recovery from the acute disease, pointing towards the possibility of chronic or even permanent smell reduction for a significant part of the patient population. To date, we have no knowledge on the specificity of anosmia towards specific odorants or chemicals and about the longer-term timeline of its persistence or reversal. METHODS: In this longitudinal study, 70 participants from a community in Lower Austria that had been tested positive for either IgG or IgM SARS-CoV-2 titers in June 2020 and a healthy control cohort (N = 348) underwent smell testing with a 12-item Cross-Cultural Smell Identification Test (CC-SIT), based upon items from the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT). The test was performed in October 2020, i.e. 4 months after initial diagnosis via antibody testing. Results were analyzed using statistical tests for contingency for each smell individually in order to detect whether reacquisition of smell is dependent on specific odorant types. RESULTS: For all odorants tested, except the odor ""smoke"", even 4 months or more after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, participants with a positive antibody titer had a reduced sense of smell when compared to the control group. On average, while the control cohort detected a set of 12 different smells with 88.0% accuracy, the antibody-positive group detected 80.0% of tested odorants. A reduction of accuracy of detection by 9.1% in the antibody-positive cohort was detected. Recovery of the ability to smell was particularly delayed for three odorants: strawberry (encoded by the aldehyde ethylmethylphenylglycidate), lemon (encoded by citronellal, a monoterpenoid aldehyde), and soap (alkali metal salts of the fatty acids plus odorous additives) exhibit a sensitivity of detection of an infection with SARS-CoV-2 of 31.0%, 41.0% and 40.0%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Four months or more after acute infection, smell performance of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients with mild or no symptoms is not fully recovered, whereby the ability to detect certain odors (strawberry, lemon and soap) is particularly affected, suggesting the possibility that these sensitivity to these smells may not only be lagging behind but may be more permanently affected.","Rebholz, H; Pfaffeneder-Mantai, F; Knoll, W; Hassel, A W; Frank, W; Kleber, C",Am J Otolaryngol,350,16

We examined the effectiveness of an education-only (EO) versus education plus sleeve compression/exercise intervention (lymphedema education and prevention [LEAP]) on lymphedema incidence and range of motion (ROM) in a group-randomized trial across 38 cooperative group sites. METHODS: The treating institution was randomly assigned to either EO or LEAP by a study statistician. All patients at a treating institution participated in the same intervention (EO or LEAP) to minimize contamination bias. Participants completed surveys, arm volume measurements, and self-reported ROM assessments before surgery and at 12 and 18 months after surgery. Lymphedema was defined as a &#8805;10% difference in limb volume at any time post-surgery up to 18 months after surgery or diagnosis by a health provider. Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests were used to compare lymphedema-free rates between groups, stratified by lymph node surgery type. Self-reported ROM differences were compared between groups. RESULTS: A total of 554 participants (56% LEAP) were included in the analyses. At 18 months, lymphedema-free rates were 58% (EO) versus 55% (LEAP) (P = .37). ROM for both arms was greater in LEAP versus EO at 12 months; by 18 months, most women reported full ROM, regardless of group. In LEAP, only one-third wore a sleeve &#8805;75% of the time; 50% performed lymphedema exercises at least weekly. CONCLUSION: Lymphedema incidence did not differ by intervention group at 18 months.

We performed state-wide SARS-CoV-2 genomic epidemiological investigations to identify HCW transmission dynamics and provide recommendations to optimise healthcare system preparedness for future outbreaks. MethodsGenome sequencing was attempted on all COVID-19 cases in Victoria, Australia. We combined genomic and epidemiologic data to investigate the source of HCW infections across multiple healthcare facilities (HCFs) in the state. Phylogenetic analysis and fine-scale hierarchical clustering were performed for the entire Victorian dataset including community and healthcare cases. Facilities provided standardised epidemiological data and putative transmission links. FindingsBetween March and October 2020, approximately 1,240 HCW COVID-19 infection cases were identified; 765 are included here. Genomic sequencing was successful for 612 (80%) cases. Thirty-six investigations were undertaken across 12 HCFs. Genomic analysis revealed that multiple introductions of COVID-19 into facilities (31/36) were more common than single introductions (5/36). Major contributors to HCW acquisitions included mobility of staff and patients between wards and facilities, and characteristics and behaviours of individual patients including super-spreading events. Key limitations at the HCF level were identified. InterpretationGenomic epidemiological analyses enhanced understanding of HCW infections, revealing unsuspected clusters and transmission networks.

Mechanisms to explain long-term neurological sequelae are unknown and need to be identified. Plasma from 24 individuals recovering from COVID-19 at 1 to 3 months after initial infection were collected for cytokine and antibody levels and neuronal-enriched extracellular vesicle (nEV) protein cargo analyses. Plasma cytokine IL-4 was increased in all COVID-19 participants. Volunteers with self-reported neurological problems (nCoV, n = 8) had a positive correlation of IL6 with age or severity of the sequalae, at least one co-morbidity and increased SARS-CoV-2 antibody compared to those COVID-19 individuals without neurological issues (CoV, n = 16). Protein markers of neuronal dysfunction including amyloid beta, neurofilament light, neurogranin, total tau, and p-T181-tau were all significantly increased in the nEVs of all participants recovering from COVID-19 compared to historic controls. This study suggests ongoing peripheral and neuroinflammation after COVID-19 infection that may influence neurological sequelae by altering nEV proteins. Individuals recovering from COVID-19 may have occult neural damage while those with demonstrative neurological symptoms additionally had more severe infection. Longitudinal studies to monitor plasma biomarkers and nEV cargo are warranted to assess persistent neurodegeneration and systemic effects.","Sun, Bing; Tang, Norina; Peluso, Michael J; Iyer, Nikita S; Torres, Leonel; Donatelli, Joanna L; Munter, Sadie E; Nixon, Christopher C; Rutishauser, Rachel L; Rodriguez-Barraquer, Isabel; Greenhouse, Bryan; Kelly, John D; Martin, Jeffrey N; Deeks, Steven G; Henrich, Timothy J; Pulliam, Lynn",,350,1

Many harm reduction programs continue to support people who use illicit drugs (PWUD) during the pandemic, yet PWUD working in harm reduction programs (sometimes termed 'peers') experience precarious labour conditions characterized by low wages, minimal employee benefits (such as paid sick leave) and high employment insecurity. Along with precarious labour conditions, PWUD face heightened vulnerabilities to COVID-19 and yet have been largely overlooked in global response to the pandemic. Operating under conditions of economic and legal precarity, harm reduction programs' reliance on precarious labour (e.g. on-call, temporary and unpaid work) renders some services vulnerable to staffing shortages and service disruptions during the pandemic, while also heightening the risk of virus transmission among workers, service users and their communities. We call for immediate policy and programmatic actions to strengthen working conditions within these settings with a priority on enhancing protections and supports for workers in peer roles.","Olding, Michelle; Barker, Allison; McNeil, Ryan; Boyd, Jade",Int J Drug Policy,350,24

From the sensitivity analysis parameters $u_{11}$, $b_1$, $\beta_1$, $d_1$ and $\mu$ were found to be sensitive. Findings from the Optimal Control studies suggests that the infection among the adult population(age $\geq 30)$ is least considering the second control $u_{12}$ whereas, when both the controls $u_{11}$ and $u_{12}$ are considered together the infectives is minimum in case of young populations(age $ \leq 30$).

We sought to determine the association between population density and R0 of SARS-CoV-2 across U.S. counties. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using linear mixed models with random intercept and fixed slopes to assess the association of population density and R0, and controlled for state-level effects using random intercepts. We also assessed whether the association was differential across county-level main mode of transportation percentage as a proxy for transportation accessibility, and adjusted for median household income. The median R0 among the United States counties was 1.66 (IQR: 1.35-2.11). A population density threshold of 22 people/km2 was needed to sustain an outbreak. Counties with greater population density have greater rates of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, likely due to increased contact rates in areas with greater density. An increase in one unit of log population density increased R0 by 0.16 (95% CI: 0.13 to 0.19). This association remained when adjusted for main mode of transportation and household income. The effect of population density on R0 was not modified by transportation mode. Our findings suggest that dense areas increase contact rates necessary for disease transmission.

Since the beginning of 2020, this stability has been undergoing one of the most vigorous pressure tests ever due to the COVID-19 outbreak. From a mere health issue, the pandemic has turned into an economic threat to food security globally in the forms of lockdowns, economic decline, food trade restrictions, and rising food inflation. It is safe to assume that the novel health crisis has badly struck the least developed and developing economies, where people are particularly vulnerable to hunger and malnutrition. However, due to the recency of the COVID-19 problem, the impacts of macroeconomic fluctuations on food insecurity have remained scantily explored. In this study, the authors attempted to bridge this gap by revealing interactions between the food security status of people and the dynamics of COVID-19 cases, food trade, food inflation, and currency volatilities. The study was performed in the cases of 45 developing economies distributed to three groups by the level of income. The consecutive application of the autoregressive distributed lag method, Yamamoto's causality test, and variance decomposition analysis allowed the authors to find the food insecurity effects of COVID-19 to be more perceptible in upper-middle-income economies than in the least developed countries. In the latter, food security risks attributed to the emergence of the health crisis were mainly related to economic access to adequate food supply (food inflation), whereas in higher-income developing economies, availability-sided food security risks (food trade restrictions and currency depreciation) were more prevalent. The approach presented in this paper contributes to the establishment of a methodology framework that may equip decision-makers with up-to-date estimations of health crisis effects on economic parameters of food availability and access to staples in food-insecure communities.","Erokhin, Vasilii; Gao, Tianming",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),350,6

METHODS: 37 cases of critically ill patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU of Huangshi Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital from February 1st to March 20th, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. 5 patients whose clinical data met the specific criteria were finally cataloged into death group (2 patients) and survival group (3 patients). The patient-specific three-dimensional airways were reconstructed from the central airways down to the 4th-5th bifurcation of the tracheobronchial tree. The volume changes of bronchi were calculated during the disease progression according to the comparison of two CT scans. Additionally, the changes of air flow resistance were analyzed using numerical simulation of CFD. RESULTS: Pearson correlation analysis demonstrated that there was negative correlation between the change of volume (&#916;V) and the change of resistance (&#916;R) for all COVID-19 patients (r=-0.7025). For total airway volume, an average decrease of -11.41±15.71% was observed in death group compared to an average increase of 1.86±10.80% in survival group (p=0.0232). For air flow through airways in lower lobe, the resistance increases for death group by 10.97±77.66% and decreases for survival group by -45.49±42.04% (p=0.0246). CONCLUSION: The variation of flow resistance in the airway could be used as a non-invasive functional evaluation for the prognosis and outcome of critically ill patients with COVID-19. The 'virtual' pulmonary function test by integrating follow-up CT scans with patient-derived CFD analysis could be a potentially powerful way in improving the efficiency of treatment for critically ill patients with COVID-19.","Pan, Shi-Yu; Ding, Ming; Huang, Jing; Cai, Yan; Huang, Ying-Zi",Comput Methods Programs Biomed,350,1

We aimed to identify anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in sera collected from 4th November 2019 to 9th March 2020, in order to assess the possible spread of the virus in Italy earlier than the first official national diagnosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were evaluated in retrospective serum samples from 234 patients with liver diseases (Hep-patients) and from 56 blood donors (BDs). We used two rapid serologic tests which were confirmed by a validated chemoluminescence assay. RESULTS: Via rapid tests, we found 10/234 (4.3%) IgG-positive and 1/234 (0.4%) IgM-positive cases in the Hep-patient group. Two/56 (3.6%) IgG-positive and 2/56 (3.6%) IgM-positive cases were detected in BD group. Chemoluminescence confirmed IgG-positivity in 3 Hep-patients and 1 BD and IgM-positivity in 1 Hep-patient. RNAemia was not detected in any of the subjects, rendering the risk of transfusion transmission negligible.

Social distancing has changed the way people behave online, and we expect that engagement in sexting and online sexual victimization behaviors have increased during lockdown. The aim of this paper is to study the prevalence of sexting and online sexual victimization behaviors during the COVID-19 lockdown in Spanish adults in order to explore how social distancing has affected these behaviors. The sample comprised 293 Spanish adults (mean age = 30.3; 66.2% female) who took part in an online survey about their engagement in sexting behaviors and online sexual victimization experiences. Overall results were apparently not supportive of our main hypothesis, showing that both sexting engagement and online sexual victimization decreased during lockdown despite the increase in internet use. Apart from differences in time period of reference, some alternative hypotheses relate to the increased presence of capable guardians according to the routine activities theory and to forced distance as a demotivation to sext. Possible explanations and hypotheses for these results are discussed further in the paper.","Gassó, Aina M; Mueller-Johnson, Katrin; Agustina, José R; Gómez-Durán, Esperanza L",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),350,1

OBJECTIVE: To compare severity scores used for community-acquired pneumonia to identify high-risk patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. DESIGN: PSI, CURB-65, qSOFA, and MuLBSTA, a new score for viral pneumonia, were calculated on admission to hospital to identify high-risk patients for in-hospital mortality, admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), or use of mechanical ventilation. Area under receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC), sensitivity, and specificity for each score were determined and AUROC was compared among them. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia included in the SEMI-COVID-19 Network. KEY RESULTS: We examined 10,238 patients with COVID-19. Mean age of patients was 66.6 years and 57.9% were males. The most common comorbidities were as follows: hypertension (49.2%), diabetes (18.8%), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (12.8%). Acute respiratory distress syndrome (34.7%) and acute kidney injury (13.9%) were the most common complications. In-hospital mortality was 20.9%. PSI and CURB-65 showed the highest AUROC (0.835 and 0.825, respectively). qSOFA and MuLBSTA had a lower AUROC (0.728 and 0.715, respectively). qSOFA was the most specific score (specificity 95.7%) albeit its sensitivity was only 26.2%. PSI had the highest sensitivity (84.1%) and a specificity of 72.2%. CONCLUSIONS: PSI and CURB-65, specific severity scores for pneumonia, were better than qSOFA and MuLBSTA at predicting mortality in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

Ivermectin is a putative antiviral compound; the proposed mechanism is the inhibition of nuclear translocation of viral proteins, facilitated by mammalian host importins, a necessary process for propagation of infections. We systematically reviewed the evidence for the applicability of ivermectin against viral infections including SARS-CoV-2 regarding efficacy, mechanisms and selective toxicity. The SARS-CoV-2 genome was mined to determine potential nuclear location signals for ivermectin and meta-analyses for in vivo studies included all comparators over time, dose range and viral replication in multiple organs. Ivermectin inhibited the replication of many viruses including those in Flaviviridae, Circoviridae and Coronaviridae families in vitro. Real and mock nuclear location signals were identified in SARS-CoV-2, a potential target for ivermectin and predicting a sequestration bait for importin ß, stopping infected cells from reaching a virus-resistant state. While pharmacokinetic evaluations indicate that ivermectin could be toxic if applied based on in vitro studies, inhibition of viral replication in vivo was shown for Porcine circovirus in piglets and Suid herpesvirus in mice. Overall standardized mean differences and 95% confidence intervals for ivermectin versus controls were -4.43 (-5.81, -3.04), p < 0.00001. Based on current results, the potential for repurposing ivermectin as an antiviral agent is promising. However, further work is needed to reconcile in vitro studies with clinical efficacy.

The Collaboration of Observational HIV Epidemiological Research Europe (COHERE) has shown that primary Pneumocystis jirovecii Pneumonia (PjP) prophylaxis can be safely withdrawn in patients with CD4 counts of 100 to 200 cells/µL if plasma HIV-RNA is suppressed on combination antiretroviral therapy. Whether this holds true for secondary prophylaxis is not known, and this has proved difficult to determine due to the much lower population at risk. METHODS: We estimated the incidence of secondary PjP by including patient data collected from 1998 to 2015 from the COHERE cohort collaboration according to time-updated CD4 counts, HIV-RNA and use of PjP prophylaxis in persons >16 years of age. We fitted a Poisson generalized additive model in which the smoothed effect of CD4 was modelled by a restricted cubic spline, and HIV-RNA was stratified as low (<400), medium (400 to 10,000) or high (>10,000copies/mL). RESULTS: There were 373 recurrences of PjP during 74,295 person-years (py) in 10,476 patients. The PjP incidence in the different plasma HIV-RNA strata differed significantly and was lowest in the low stratum. For patients off prophylaxis with CD4 counts between 100 and 200 cells/µL and HIV-RNA below 400 copies/mL, the incidence of recurrent PjP was 3.9 (95% CI: 2.0 to 5.8) per 1000 py, not significantly different from patients on prophylaxis in the same stratum (1.9, 95% CI: 0.1 to 3.7). CONCLUSIONS: HIV viraemia importantly affects the risk of recurrent PjP. In virologically suppressed patients on ART with CD4 counts of 100 to 200/µL, the incidence of PjP off prophylaxis is below 10/1000 py. Secondary PjP prophylaxis may be safely withheld in such patients. While European guidelines recommend discontinuing secondary PjP prophylaxis only if CD4 counts rise above 200 cells/mL, the latest US Guidelines consider secondary prophylaxis discontinuation even in patients with a CD4 count above 100 cells/µL and suppressed viral load. Our results strengthen and support this US recommendation.","Atkinson, Andrew; Miro, Jose M; Mocroft, Amanda; Reiss, Peter; Kirk, Ole; Morlat, Philippe; Ghosn, Jade; Stephan, Christoph; Mussini, Cristina; Antoniadou, Anastasia; Doerholt, Katja; Girardi, Enrico; De Wit, Stéphane; Kraus, David; Zwahlen, Marcel; Furrer, Hansjakob",J Int AIDS Soc,350,9

The participants were grouped as;yoga practitioners, other spiritual practitioners, and non-practitioners based on their responses to daily practices that they follow. Yoga practitioners were further examined based on the duration of practice as;long-term, mid-term and beginners. Multivariate analysis indicates that yoga practitioners had significantly lower depression, anxiety, & stress (DASS), and higher general wellbeing (SWGB) as well as higher peace of mind (POMS) than the other two groups. The results further revealed that the yoga practitioners significantly differed in the perception of personal control, illness concern and emotional impact of COVID19. However, there was no significant difference found for the measure of resilience (BRS) in this study. Yoga practitioners also significantly differed in the cognitive reappraisal strategy for regulating their emotions than the other two groups. Interestingly, it was found that beginners -those who had started practicing yoga only during the lockdown period reported no significant difference for general wellbeing and peace of mind when compared to the mid- term practitioner. Evidence supports that yoga was found as an effective self- management strategy to cope with stress, anxiety and depression, and maintain wellbeing during COVID19 lockdown.","Sahniid, P.

In this work, we combined atomistic simulations and conformational dynamics analysis with the ensemble-based mutational profiling of binding interactions for a diverse panel of SARS-CoV-2 spike complexes with nanobodies. Using this computational toolkit we identified dynamic signatures and binding affinity fingerprints for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein complexes with nanobodies Nb6 and Nb20, VHH E, a pair combination VHH E+U, a biparatopic nanobody VHH VE, and a combination of CC12.3 antibody and VHH V/W nanobodies. Through ensemble-based deep mutational profiling of stability and binding affinities, we identify critical hotspots and characterize molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding with single ultra-potent nanobodies, nanobody cocktails and biparatopic nanobodies. By quantifying dynamic and energetic determinants of the SARS-CoV-2 S binding with nanobodies, we also examine the effects of circulating variants and escaping mutations. We found that mutational escape mechanisms may be controlled through structurally and energetically adaptable binding hotspots located in the host receptor-accessible binding epitope that are dynamically coupled to the stability centers in the distant epitope targeted by VHH U/V/W nanobodies. The results of this study suggested a mechanism in which through cooperative dynamic changes, nanobody combinations and biparatopic nanobody can modulate the global protein response and induce the increased resilience to common escape mutants.","Verkhivker, Gennady; Agajanian, Steve; Oztas, Deniz Yasar; Gupta, Grace",,350,16

SETTING: Community-setting. PARTICIPANTS: Participants included a total of 9,936 older adults aged 65 years or older. MEASUREMENTS: Frailty was characterized as slow walking speed or/and muscle weakness represented by grip strength. Cognitive function was assessed according to several tests. Cognitive impairment was defined below the age-education reference threshold. Participants were categorized into the four groups: robust, cognitive impairment alone, frailty alone, and cognitive frailty (both frail and cognitive impairment). Incident disability data was extracted from the Japanese Long-Term Care system. RESULTS: The prevalence of cognitive frailty was 11.2%. The cumulative incidence rates of incident disability in each group were also estimated (robust, 9.6/1,000 person-years (95% CI 7.9 to 11.7); cognitive impairment, 21.3/1,000 person years (95% CI 16.3 to 27.7); frailty, 45.4/1,000 person years (95% CI 39.5 to 52.3); and cognitive frailty, 79.9/1,000 person years (95% CI 68.6 to 93.1)).

Twenty-one (42.0%) patients had active disease at COVID-19 diagnosis, while 25 (50.0%) had no evidence of disease (NED), and 4 (8.0%) were unknown. Over 1 in 3 admitted patients experienced a ""severe outcome,"" which was defined as critical level care (14, 34.1%), use of vasopressors (9, 22.0%), intubation (8, 19.5%), or death (5, 12.2%). Patients with severe outcomes were found to have statistically higher values of absolute neutrophil count (p = 0.005), aspartate aminotransferase (p = 0.049), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, (p = 0.001) and lactate dehydrogenase (p = 0.040) on admission. Overall survival (OS) was not statistically different between those with hematologic versus solid malignancy nor between those with active disease versus remission (both p>0.05). Thirteen (81.3%) of the 16 patients who had cancer treatment in 2020 experienced delays in cancer therapy. Additional cases are being evaluated as the pandemic continues with the goal of identifying areas for potential intervention to improve outcomes in this at-risk population.","Antrim, Lauren; Capone, Stephen; Dong, Stephen; Chung, David; Lin, Sonia; Wald-Dickler, Noah; In, Gino K",Cancer Treat Res Commun,350,24

As a result of these measures, Internet traffic of residential users increased, in particular, for remote working, entertainment, commerce, and education. In turn, traffic demands in the Internet core shifted as well. In this paper, using data from a diverse set of vantage points (one ISP, three IXPs, and one metropolitan educational network), we study the effect of these lockdowns on traffic shifts. We find that the traffic volume increased by 15-20% almost within a week--while overall still modest, this constitutes a large increase within this short time period. The Internet infrastruct ure is able to handle this increase, as most traffic shifts occur outside of traditional peak hours. When looking at traffic sources, we find that while hypergiants still contribute a significant fraction of traffic, we see a higher increase in traffic of non-hypergiants. We observe traffic increases in applications such as Web conferencing, VPN, gaming, messaging that people use when at home. While many networks see increased traffic demands, in particular, residential users, others see major decreases, e.g., the in/out ratio of the educational network switched.","Feldmann, Anja; Gasser, Oliver; Lichtblau, Franziska; Pujol, Enric; Poese, Ingmar; Dietzel, Christoph; Wagner, Daniel; Wichtlhuber, Matthias; Tapiador, Juan; Vallina-Rodriguez, Narseo; Hohlfeld, Oliver; Smaragdakis, Georgios",,350,33

The increase in cardiac biomarkers has been associated with a worse prognosis. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the prognostic value of Troponin-T (TNT) and natriuretic peptide (BNP) in patients hospitalized for Covid-19. METHODS: This was a convenience sample of patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Data were collected from medical records to assess the association of TnT and BNP measured in the first 24 hours of hospital admission with the combined outcome (CO) of death or need for mechanical ventilation. Univariate analysis was used to compare the groups with and without the CO. Cox's multivariate model was used to determine independent predictors of the CO. RESULTS: We evaluated 183 patients (age = 66.8±17 years, 65.6% of which were males). The time of follow-up was 7 days (range 1 to 39 days). The CO occurred in 24% of the patients. The median troponin-T and BNP levels were 0.011 and 0.041ng/dL (p <0.001); 64 and 198 pg/dL (p <0.001), respectively, for the groups without and with the CO. In the univariate analysis, in addition to TnT and BNP, age, presence of coronary disease, oxygen saturation, lymphocytes, D-dimer, t-CRP and creatinine, were different between groups with and without outcomes. In the bootstrap multivariate analysis, only TnT (1.12 [95% CI 1.03-1.47]) and t-CRP (1.04 [95% CI 1.00-1.10]) were independent predictors of the CO. CONCLUSION: In the first 24h of admission, TnT, but not BNP, was an independent marker of mortality or need for invasive mechanical ventilation. This finding further reinforces the clinical importance of cardiac involvement in COVID-19.

Key questions for this ongoing evolution emerge for the global context leading to reflections on future directions for the interprofessional education field and its role in shaping future practice models. Health professions programs around the world have made a dramatic shift to virtual learning platforms in response to closures of academic institutions and restrictions imposed on learners accessing practice settings. Telemedicine, slow to become established in many countries to date, has also revolutionized practice in the current environment. Within the state of disruption and rapid change is the awareness of a silver lining that provides an opportunity for future growth. Key topics explored in this commentary include reflection on the application of existing competency frameworks, consideration of typology of team structures, reconsideration of theoretical underpinnings, revisiting of core dimensions of education, adaptation of interprofessional education activities, and the role in the future pandemic planning. As an international community of educators and researchers, the authors consider current observations relevant to interprofessional education and practice contexts and suggest a response from scholarship voices across the globe. The current pandemic offers a unique opportunity for educators, practitioners, and researchers to retain what has served interprofessional education and practice well in the past, break from what has not worked as well, and begin to imagine the new.","Langlois, Sylvia; Xyrichis, Andreas; Daulton, Brittany J; Gilbert, John; Lackie, Kelly; Lising, Dean; MacMillan, Kathleen; Najjar, Ghaidaa; Pfeifle, Andrea L; Khalili, Hossein",J Interprof Care,350,4

Various scaffold material, design, including their combination with several growth- induced substances and cells application have been being investigated and used in the area of nerve tissue engineering. However, the development remains challenges today because they are still far from ideal concerning their stability, reproducibility, including complicated handling related to the poor mechanical strength. In view of the current basis, in this study the introduction of carbonated hydroxyapatite (CHA) as promising candidate to increase mechanical properties of nerve scaffold is reported. The incorporation of CHA was not only expected to provide better mechanical properties of the scaffold. Under physiological condition, CHA is known to be the most stable phases of calcium phosphate compound. Therefore, CHA was expected to provide controlled release calcium for better axonal environment and promote fasten nerve regeneration. This study shows that CHA incorporated gelatin membrane has ideal microstructure to prevent fibrous tissue ingrowth into the injury site, while retaining its capability to survive nerve tissue by allowing adequate glucose and specific proteins diffusion. The provided Ca2+ release to the environment promoted neuronal growth, without suppressing acetylcholine esterase release activity. Neurite elongation was dramatically higher in the gelatin membrane incorporated with CHA. Introduction of CHA into gelatin membrane represents a new generation medical device for nerve reconstruction, with CHA was considered as a promising factor.","Ardhani, Retno; Ana, Ika Dewi; Tabata, Yasuhiko",J. biomed. mater. res.

It is a new Î¸-SEIHRD model (not a SIR, SEIR or other general purpose model), which takes into account the known special characteristics of this disease, as the existence of infectious undetected cases and the different sanitary and infectiousness conditions of hospitalized people. In particular, it includes a novel approach that considers the fraction Î¸ of detected cases over the real total infected cases, which allows to study the importance of this ratio on the impact of COVID-19. The model is also able to estimate the needs of beds in hospitals. It is complex enough to capture the most important effects, but also simple enough to allow an affordable identification of its parameters, using the data that authorities report on this pandemic. We study the particular case of China (including Chinese Mainland, Macao, Hong-Kong and Taiwan, as done by the World Health Organization in its reports on COVID-19), the country spreading the disease, and use its reported data to identify the model parameters, which can be of interest for estimating the spread of COVID-19 in other countries. We show a good agreement between the reported data and the estimations given by our model. We also study the behavior of the outputs returned by our model when considering incomplete reported data (by truncating them at some dates before and after the peak of daily reported cases). By comparing those results, we can estimate the error produced by the model when identifying the parameters at early stages of the pandemic. Finally, taking into account the advantages of the novelties introduced by our model, we study different scenarios to show how different values of the percentage of detected cases would have changed the global magnitude of COVID-19 in China, which can be of interest for policy makers.","Ivorra, B; Ferrández, M R; Vela-Pérez, M; Ramos, A M",Commun Nonlinear Sci Numer Simul,350,7

in thirty high burdened countries, one of which is South Africa South Africa is one of the eight countries that are said to account for the two thirds of the total new Tuberculosis cases The Tuberculosis epidemic is driven by the following reasons: firstly, poor living conditions which are a result of the wide gap between the rich and the poverty stricken among some populations;and, secondly, late presentation to health facilities Over the years, healthcare programs have made a meaningful impact in identifying patients presenting to Tuberculosis care A global Tuberculosis report shows an estimated sixty million lives were saved through Tuberculosis treatment and diagnosis between the years 2000 and 2019 This progress has encouraged the United Nations to set the health target of eradicating the Tuberculosis epidemic by 2030 For this goal to be attained, strategies to modify risk behaviour need to remain a main priority In the South African context, it would be important to note the diversity of the individuals experience which is rooted in South African socio-political history and has resulted in high levels of social inequality and disparate socio-economic status groups, as a significant factor when considering the well-being of Tuberculosis infected South Africans The aim of this research was to understand health related well-being in South Africa, by noting and comparing the diversity of life satisfaction experience between participants from different sociodemographic status groups across South Africa In this interview statistician Motladi Matatiele and

du Sud L’Afrique du Sud est un des huit pays qui, à eux seuls, regroupent les deux-tiers des nouveaux cas de tuberculose L’épidémie de tuberculose, due à de piètres conditions de vie, tant sanitaires que sociales, est le résultat d’un fossé entre les riches et les pauvres et d’une prise en charge médicale parfois trop tardive de ces derniers Toutefois, année après année, les programmes sanitaires ont eu un impact positif sur l’identification des patients souffrant de tuberculose Un rapport global sur la maladie montre que quelques soixante millions de vies ont été sauvées grâce aux diagnostics et traitements entre les années 2000 et 2019 Un tel progrès a encouragé les Nations Unies à établir comme objectif médical l’éradication de l’épidémie de tuberculose à l’horizon de 2030 Afin d’atteindre ce but, les stratégies de modifications des comportements à risques doivent rester la première priorité Dans le contexte sud-africain, il est primordial de prendre en compte la diversité des expériences individuelles qui est ancrée dans l’histoire sociopolitique du pays (l’Apartheid) et dont ont résulté de hauts niveaux d’inégalités socioéconomiques parmi les différents groupes de populations Cette histoire est un facteur des plus signifiants lorsqu’on s’intéresse à la qualité de vie des Sud-Africains atteints de tuberculose Dans cet entretien, la statisticienne Motladi Matatiele et la démographe Nancy Stiegler de l’University of the Western Cape font part de leur recherche, dont l’objectif était de comprendre la diversité des facteurs associés au bien-être des personnes souffrant de tuberculose en Afrique du Sud, considérant des patients appartenant à divers groupes et statuts socioéconomiques La discussion prend en compte les variables les plus influentes sur la qualité de vie, en utilisant les données de l’enquête « National Income Dynamic Study » de 2017 L’accent a été mis sur la sous-population souffrant de tuberculose disséminée dans les neuf provinces du pays L’échantillon consiste en quarante-quatre individus dont on a considéré les variables suivantes : l’âge, le sexe, le groupe ethnique, le lieu de résidence en 1994 (date de fin officielle du régime ségrégationniste), l’activité, l’éducation, la santé, la santé mentale, le bien-être et la cohésion sociale L’étude a employé l’Analyse des correspondances multiples pour identifier les variables associées au bien-être des individus souffrant de tuberculose Les résultats montrent que les répondants de descendance africaine rapportaient les plus bas niveaux de bien-être, suivis des participants métis, qui avaient, d’autre part, plus de chances de fumer, ce qui décroissait d’autant leur niveau ressenti de bien-être Le sexe s’est révélé être un facteur signifiant dans la mesure où les femmes ont déclaré un niveau subjectif de bien-être systématiquement plus bas que celui déclaré par leurs homologues masculins Les participants souffrant de co-infections de tuberculose et du VIH, aussi les plus touchés par la grande pauvreté, présentaient le niveau le plus bas possible de bien-être ressenti Ces derniers étaient les plus déprimés à cause des stigmates perçus, de la peur induite par leurs systèmes immunitaires affaiblis et de la prise aléatoire de leurs prescriptions pharmaceutiques L’Organisation mondiale de la santé, dans ses bulletins mensuels, a noté que l’accès aux traitements préventifs et curatifs de la tuberculose en Afrique du Sud s’est effondré de plus de cinquante pour cent entre mars et juin 2020 Il est regrettable que l’Afrique du Sud n’ait pas tenu les objectifs « 90-90-90 » fixés par son plan global d’éradication de la tuberculose en 2016 Dans le même temps, l’Organisation mondiale de la santé estime une augmentation de vingt p ur cent des cas ces dernières années Les résultats de l’étude permettent de déduire qu’une augmentation des cas de tuberculose est corrélée avec une augmentation de la pauvreté, des co-infections, d’une éducation à la santé médiocre et d’une accentuation du sentiment de rejet Il est alors possible de penser qu’entre 2017 et 2020, le degré de satisfaction et de bien-être des populations souffrant de tuberculose a décru, décroissance à laquelle l’épidémie de COVID-19 a pu largement contribuer Les institutions en charge des questions de santé publique doivent contrôler les tendances des épidémies avec la plus grande attention, dans la mesure où une réponse rapide est nécessaire pour corriger les effets néfastes de la COVID-19 sur l’éradication de la

In response, pooled testing has emerged as a promising strategy that can immediately increase testing capacity. In pooled sample testing, multiple samples are combined (or pooled) together and tested as a single unit. If the pool is positive, the individual samples can then be individually tested to identify the positive case(s). Here, we provide support for the adoption of sample pooling with the point-of-care Cepheid Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 molecular assay. Corroborating previous findings, the limit of detection of this assay was comparable to laboratory-developed reverse-transcription quantitative PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests, with observed detection below 100 copies/mL. The Xpert® Xpress assay detected SARS-CoV-2 after samples with minimum viral loads of 461 copies/mL were pooled in groups of six. Based on these data, we recommend the adoption of pooled testing with the Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay where warranted based on public health needs. The suggested number of samples per pool, or the pooling depth, is unique for each point-of-care testing site and can be determined by the positive test rates. To statistically determine appropriate pooling depth, we have calculated the pooling efficiency for numerous combinations of pool sizes and test rates. This information is included as a supplemental dataset that we encourage public health authorities to use as a guide to make recommendations that will maximize testing capacity and resource conservation.","Becker, Michael G; Taylor, Tracy; Kiazyk, Sandra; Cabiles, Dana R; Meyers, Adrienne F A; Sandstrom, Paul A",PLoS One,350,6

Following the COVID-19 outbreak, frontal and bedside teaching was interrupted. Therefore, we decided to provide distant teaching until having the opportunity to resume clinical bedside teaching. A team of tutors composed a course of weekly units, each week assigned to a different subject in internal medicine. A total of 120 students were divided into 15 groups of 8 students, each group guided by a personal tutor. The format of each unit included online pretest, clinical virtual cases and two separate 2 hour ZOOM sessions with the tutor. The pretest was based on 1-3 chapters from Harrison's Internal Medicine textbook, 20th edition, and consisted of both clinical reasoning and knowledge questions. During ZOOM sessions with the tutor, the students practiced clinical problem solving. In addition, all the students were granted free access to the commercial ""Aquifer"" case-based virtual course for more practice. The students' feedback at the end of the learning period revealed that, although frustrated in being away from the clinics, the overall level of satisfaction from the course was good (rated 5 or 4/5 by 65% of responders) and the time was used efficiently. In conclusion, the students received a positive proactive learning experience of both theoretical aspects and clinical reasoning skills in internal medicine. There is no doubt that bedside teaching in medicine is invaluable and can't be replaced by any other means, however, given the circumstances, our format provided a reasonable temporary alternative.","Dolnikov, K.; Nave, R.; Krayem, B.; Assam, Z.; Karban, A.; Flugelman, M.

However, the foundation for video conferencing solutions is still insufficient. So this technology has become an important issue. In particular, these technologies are essential for non-face-to-face testing, and technology dissemination is urgent. In this paper, we present a single video conferencing solution using gaze estimation in preparation for these problems. Gaze is an important cue for the tasks such as analysis of human behavior. Hence, numerous studies have been proposed to solve gaze estimation using deep learning, which is one of the most prominent methods up to date. We use these gaze estimation methods to detect abnormal behavior of video conferencing participants. Our contribution is as follows. i) We find and apply the optimal network for the gaze estimation method and apply a self-supervised method to improve accuracy. ii) For anomaly detection, we present a new dataset that aggregates the values of a new gaze, head pose, etc. iii) We train newly created data on Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) models to detect anomaly behavior based on deep learning. We demonstrate the robustness of our method through experiments.","Suneung-Kim,; Lee, Seong-Whan",,350,16

Injury to the spleen, among other factors, contribute to persons with SCD being particularly susceptible to infection. Infants and very young children are especially vulnerable. The 'Co-operative Study of Sickle Cell Disease' observed an incidence rate for pneumococcal septicaemia of 10 per 100 person-years in children under the age of three years. Vaccines, including customary pneumococcal vaccines, may be of limited use in this age group. Therefore, prophylactic penicillin regimens may be advisable for this population. This is an update of a Cochrane Review which was first published in 2002, and previously updated, most recently in 2017. OBJECTIVES: To compare the effects of antibiotic prophylaxis against pneumococcus in children with SCD receiving antibiotic prophylaxis compared to those without in relation to: 1. incidence of Streptococcus pneumoniae infection; 2. mortality (as reported in the included studies); 3. drug-related adverse events (as reported in the included studies) to the individual and the community; 4. the impact of discontinuing at various ages on incidence of infection and mortality. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, which is comprised of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and also two clinical trials registries: ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Registry Platform (not in 2020 given access issues relating to Covid-19 pandemic). Additionally, we carried out hand searching of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of the most recent search: 25 January 2021. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing prophylactic antibiotics to prevent pneumococcal infection in children with SCD with placebo, no treatment or a comparator drug. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane were used. Both authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. The authors used the GRADE criteria to assess the certainty of the evidence. MAIN RESULTS: Six trials were identified by the searches, of which three trials were eligible for inclusion. A total of 880 children, who were between three months to five years of age at randomization were included. The included studies were conducted in centres in the USA and in Kingston, Jamaica. In trials that investigated initiation of penicillin on risk of pneumococcal infection, the odds ratio was 0.37 (95% confidence interval 0.16 to 0.86) (two trials, 457 children) (low-certainty evidence), while for withdrawal the odds ratio was 0.49 (95% confidence interval 0.09 to 2.71) (one trial, 400 children) (low-certainty evidence). Adverse drug effects were rare and minor. Rates of pneumococcal infection were found to be relatively low in children over the age of five years. Overall, the certainty of the evidence for all outcomes was judged to be low. The results from the risk of bias assessment undertaken identified two domains in which the risk of bias was considered to be high, these were incomplete outcome data (attrition bias) (two trials) and allocation concealment (selection bias) (one trial). Domains considered to have a low risk of bias for all three trials were selective reporting (reporting bias) and blinding (performance and detection bias). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The evidence examined was determined to be of low certainty and suggests that prophylactic penicillin significantly reduces risk of pneumococcal infection in children with homozygous SCD, and is associated with minimal adverse reactions. Further research may help to determine the ideal age to safely withdraw penicillin.","Rankine-Mullings, Angela E; Owusu-Ofori, Shirley",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,350,16

We found that even lymphopenia was the most common lab finding in adults, it infrequently occurred in children (9.8%). Moreover, elevated creatine kinase MB isoenzyme (CK-MB) was much more commonly observed in children (27.0%) than that in adults, suggesting that heart injury would be more likely to happen in pediatric patients.

We aim to examine the differential importation risks with departure origins and post-arrival controls. Methods We developed a Bayesian framework to model disease progress of COVID-19 and the effectiveness of travel measures and inferred the origin-specific disease prevalence among inbound travellers, using data on passengers arriving in Hong Kong and laboratory-confirmed imported cases. We estimated the origin-specific risks of releasing infectious travellers under different control strategies and traveller volumes. We also estimated the risk of having released infectious travellers when a resurgence occurs in departure locations with no imported cases during a certain period. Findings Under the then strict controls of 14-day quarantine and testing on day 12, the Philippines imposed the greatest importation risk among the studied countries/regions (95.8% of releasing at least one infectious traveller, 95% credible interval (CrI), 94.8-96.6%). This was higher than that from low prevalence countries/regions (e.g., 23.4%, 95% CrI, 21.6-25.3% for Taiwan) if controls relaxed (i.e., 7-day quarantine and test on day 5). Increased traveller volumes and resurgence in departure locations with low prevalence under relaxed controls did not impose a greater importation risk than high prevalence locations under stricter controls. Interpretation Moderate relaxation of control measures for travellers arriving from low prevalence locations did not impose higher risks of community outbreaks than strict controls on travellers from high prevalence locations.

Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is associated with cardiometabolic disturbances, is a source of proinflammatory cytokines and a marker of visceral adiposity. We investigated the relation between EAT characteristics and outcomes in COVID-19 patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: This post-hoc analysis of a large prospective investigation included all adult patients (&#8805;18 years) admitted to San Raffaele University Hospital in Milan, Italy, from February 25th to April 19th, 2020 with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who underwent a chest computed tomography (CT) scan for COVID-19 pneumonia and had anthropometric data available for analyses. EAT volume and attenuation (EAT-At, a marker of EAT inflammation) were measured on CT scan. Primary outcome was critical illness, defined as admission to intensive care unit (ICU), invasive ventilation or death. Cox regression and regression tree analyses were used to assess the relationship between clinical variables, EAT characteristics and critical illness. One-hundred and ninety-two patients were included (median [25th-75th percentile] age 60 years [53-70], 76% men). Co-morbidities included overweight/obesity (70%), arterial hypertension (40%), and diabetes (16%). At multivariable Cox regression analysis, EAT-At (HR 1.12 [1.04-1.21]) independently predicted critical illness, while increasing PaO2/FiO2 was protective (HR 0.996 [95% CI 0.993; 1.00]). CRP, plasma glucose on admission, EAT-At and PaO2/FiO2 identified five risk groups that significantly differed with respect to time to death or admission to ICU (log-rank p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Increased EAT attenuation, a marker of EAT inflammation, but not obesity or EAT volume, predicts critical COVID-19.

The prototypical &#945;-ketoamide 13b inhibitor was used as a control to guide selection of the top 30 compounds with respect to binding affinity to the Mpro active site. Further studies and analyses including blind docking were performed to identify hypericin, cyanidin-3-O-glucoside and SRT2104 as potential leads. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that hypericin (&#916;G = -18.6 and -19.3 kcal/mol), cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (&#916;G = -50.8 and -42.1 kcal/mol), and SRT2104 (&#916;G = -8.7 and -20.6 kcal/mol), formed stable interactions with the Mpro active site. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay indicated that, albeit, not as potent as the covalent positive control (GC376), our leads inhibited the Mpro with activity in the micromolar range, and an order of effectiveness of hypericin and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside > SRT2104 > SRT1720. Overall, our findings, and those highlighted by others indicate that hypericin and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside are suitable candidates for progress to in vitro and in vivo antiviral studies.","Pitsillou, Eleni; Liang, Julia; Karagiannis, Chris; Ververis, Katherine; Darmawan, Kevion K; Ng, Ken; Hung, Andrew; Karagiannis, Tom C",Comput Biol Chem,350,12

As a collaborative and self-guided, inquiry-based learning method, it focuses on learners' intrinsic motivation while working on real world problems organised in projects (""Challenges"" in ""CBL"") with an experiential and progressive approach to apply acquired knowledge in real world scenarios, ideate solution concepts and build innovative digital products. To overcome limitations of spiral curriculum or elaboration theory, the authors applied narrative theory to design the program's educational experience for the academic year 2019/2020 as a cohesive journey within a communal learning environment with a coherent and connected structure of narratively driven learning Challenges. The authors present concepts to develop their approach further towards an emergent narrative experience design system to manage the educational journey as it develops, rather than scripting it. This paper evolves the authors' Narrative Experience Design Canvas to model educational experience design that encourages unscripted, emergent narratives for experiential education with the goal of fostering learners' engagement, agency and creativity. Derived in part by models developed for digital interactive storytelling or educational video games, it categorises the components for designing an educational experience that allows the learning progression to be driven by learners as co-authors and describes mechanisms that allow unscripted narratives to emerge based on intrinsic motivation. Additionally, the authors present considerations for synchronous and asynchronous learning to evolve their framework for application in blended or remote learning scenarios. Drawing upon findings for remote learning and experiential e-learning - ee-learning - presented by scholars as well as implications identified during the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting switch to remote learning within the program at University of Naples Federico II in 2020, it is shown how combining narrative elements with experiential e-learning principles can result in increased engagement, motivation and sense of community in learners. Using the example of an individual learning unit - a Challenge - considerations from overall course design down to day-to-day learning activities within the course are presented. For the future, the authors indicate action points to develop this model into an Emergent Narrative System for designing narratively driven and experiential software development education programs and indicate areas of further research on learning activity design for blended or remote learning experiences.","Recke, Moritz Philip Perna Stefano",Electronic Journal of e-Learning,350,12

Unfortunately, no drug or vaccine for treating human this coronavirus infection is available yet. Numerous options for controlling or preventing emerging 2019-nCoV infections may be predicted, including vaccines, interferon therapies, and small-molecule drugs. However, new interventions are likely to require months to years to develop. In addition, most of the existing antiviral treatments frequently lead to the development of viral resistance combined with the problem of side effects, viral re-emergence, and viral dormancy. The pharmaceutical industry is progressively targeting phytochemical extracts, medicinal plants, and aromatic herbs with the aim of identifying lead compounds, focusing principally on appropriate alternative antiviral drugs. Spices, herbal medicines, essential oils (EOs), and distilled natural products provide a rich source of compounds for the discovery and production of novel antiviral drugs. The determination of the antiviral mechanisms of these natural products has revealed how they interfere with the viral life cycle, i.e., during viral entry, replication, assembly, or discharge, as well as virus-specific host targets. Presently, there are no appropriate or approved drugs against CoVs, but some potential natural treatments and cures have been proposed. Given the perseverance of the 2019-nCoV outbreak, this review paper will illustrate several of the potent antiviral chemical constituents extracted from medicinal and aromatic plants, natural products, and herbal medicines with recognized in vitro and in vivo effects, along with their structure–effect relationships. As this review shows, numerous potentially valuable aromatic herbs and phytochemicals are awaiting assessment and exploitation for therapeutic use against genetically and functionally different virus families, including coronaviruses.","Boukhatem, Mohamed Nadjib; Setzer, William N.",Plants,350,5

In May 2020, the adult UVA CF program redesigned the care model to adjust to the reopening of ambulatory operations and introduced hybrid clinics. The goal remained to minimize person-to-person contacts for patients and care team members (CTMs) while ensuring patient access to quarterly, coproduced, synchronous, multidisciplinary CF care, similar to pre-COVID-19 era regular CF care. Methods: Using quality improvement tools, the UVA adult CF program created a standardized hybrid model of care for in-clinic visits, which included combined components of in-person and synchronous virtual interactions with members of the multidisciplinary team. Results: A total of 16 hybrid visits occurred between May 14 and June 11, 2020. All hybrid visits were multidisciplinary and fulfilled patient requests to see CTMs. All patients seen by hybrid encounter participated in coproduced agenda setting, underwent spirometry, and obtained blood work; 75% provided sputum for surveillance culture. Each hybrid visit type was attended by an average of four CTMs and amounted to 63 separate interactions. Of these interactions, 28 were completed virtually, reducing in-person contacts and personal protection equipment utilization by 44% compared with a fully in-person model of care. Conclusions: Combining in-person and telehealth components in a multidisciplinary CF care model reduces patient and staff interactions and personal protective equipment utilization. The hybrid model of in-person/remote combined care enables reliable access to biological data to support medical decision making while mitigating the risks of person-to-person contact for patients and staff.","List, Rhonda; Compton, Martina; Soper, Morgan; Bruschwein, Heather; Gettle, Lucy; Bailey, Molly; Starheim, Elissa; Kalmanek, John; Somerville, Lindsay; Albon, Dana",Telemed. j. e. health,350,21

In the absence of vaccines and effective therapeutical solutions, non-pharmaceutic intervention has become a major way for controlling the epidemic. Gentle mitigation interventions are able to slow down the epidemic but not to halt it well. While strict suppression interventions are efficient for controlling the epidemic, long-term measures are likely to have negative impacts on economics and people's daily live. Hence, dynamically balancing suppression and mitigation interventions plays a fundamental role in manipulating the epidemic curve. METHODS: We collected data of the number of infections for several countries during the COVID-19 pandemics and found a clear phenomenon of periodic waves of infection. Based on the observation, by connecting the infection level with the medical resources and a tolerance parameter, we propose a mathematical model to understand impacts of combining intervention measures on the epidemic dynamics. RESULTS: Depending on the parameters of the medical resources, tolerance level, and the starting time of interventions, the combined intervention measure dynamically changes with the infection level, resulting in a periodic wave of infections controlled below an accepted level. The study reveals that, (a) with an immediate, strict suppression, the numbers of infections and deaths are well controlled with a significant reduction in a very short time period; (b) an appropriate, dynamical combination of suppression and mitigation may find a feasible way in reducing the impacts of epidemic on people's live and economics. CONCLUSIONS: While the assumption of interventions deployed with a cycle of period in the model is limited and unrealistic, the phenomenon of periodic waves of infections in reality is captured by our model.

However, these measures have been associated with the onset or increase of anxiety and depression symptoms in the population. Music listening was previously shown to regulate emotion, consequently reducing depression symptoms. Since previous studies with Brazilian samples have already shown a high prevalence of depressive symptoms during the first confinement period, the aim of this study was threefold: (i) to compare groups with severe depression symptoms and no depression in what concerns to demographic and socio-economic factors as well as symptoms of anxiety and resilience levels, (ii) to explore changes in music listening daily routine during the confinement measures by both groups (no depression and severe depression), and (iii) to investigate which were the main factors influencing both two groups to music listening during the COVID-19 pandemic. This cross-sectional study included 494 Brazilian respondents aged 18 years and above. Our online survey comprised demographics, socio-economic, and COVID-19 related questionnaires, with questions regarding music listening used during social distancing measures on which the participants rated how much each of the 41 potential reasons for listening to music changed in importance compared to the situation before the pandemic and also the evaluation of anxiety, depression, and resilience levels. The respondents with severe depression were younger and showed higher levels of anxiety symptoms and lower resilience level. Furthermore, they were increasingly likely to listen to music to feel emotionally better with the situation, to feel comfort, to forget problems, to be energetic, to decrease sad feelings, to relax, to cheer up, to forget concerns, to express feelings, to reduce anxiety, to remember better times, to relieve boredom, to mentally stimulate themselves, and to ward off stressful thoughts compared to the participants with no depression. The exploratory factor analysis (FA) identified four types of music listening functions during social distancing measures: negative mood management, cognitive functioning, positive mood management, and physical involvement, in which the participants with severe depression revealed significant differences compared to non-depressed participants for the negative mood management factor, which shows the importance of music listening to regulate their negative emotions. As a conclusion, we can argue that most of our respondents used music listening to cope with and regulate their moods during confinement, especially those who presented with severe depression symptoms.","Ribeiro, F.

We evaluate several domain-specific LMs, fine-tuning them on datasets centered on drugs and diseases that we represent as KGs and enrich with textual entity descriptions. We integrate the LM-based models with KG embedding models, using a router method that learns to assign each input example to either type of model and provides a substantial boost in performance.

Meta-analyses have affirmed that these agents do not worsen clinical outcomes in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. To date, only a limited number of studies have directly evaluated the safety of inpatient prescription of ACE inhibitors/ARBs during acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) illness. METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted to investigate the impact of inpatient provision of ACE inhibitors/ARBs on morbidity and mortality in patients admitted to the hospital with COVID-19. Relationships were explored by using linear and logistic regression. FINDINGS: A total of 612 adult patients met the inclusion criteria, of whom 151 (24.7%) patients were established on ACE inhibitors/ARBs. Despite correction for known confounders, discontinuation of ACE inhibitors/ARBs was highly predictive of worsened outcomes in COVID-19. The proportion of doses omitted in the hospital was significantly associated with increased mortality (OR, 9.59; 95% CI, 2.55-36.09; P < 0.001), maximum National Early Warning Score 2 (OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.27-2.17; P < 0.001), maximum oxygen requirements (OR, 3.00; 95% CI, 1.83-4.91; P < 0.001), and maximum C-reactive protein concentration (OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.06-3.17; P = 0.030). IMPLICATIONS: Our data show a strong association between missed ACE inhibitor/ARB doses with increased morbidity and mortality. The available evidence supports continuation of currently accepted practice surrounding ACE inhibitor/ARB therapy in acute illness, which is to limit drug omission to established acute contraindications, to actively monitor such decisions, and to restart therapy as soon as it is safe to do so.

Regression analyses examined how political preferences influenced the association between governors' COVID-19 communications and residents' mobility patterns. Governors' recommendations for residents to stay at home preceded stay-at-home orders and led to a significant reduction in mobility that was comparable to the effect of the orders themselves. Effects were larger in Democratic- than in Republican-leaning counties, a pattern more pronounced under Republican governors. Democratic-leaning counties also responded more strongly to recommendations from Republican than from Democratic governors.

Selenium, as one of the important micronutrients implicated in viral infections, was suggested to play roles. METHODS: An ecological study was performed to assess the association between the COVID-19 related fatality and the selenium content both from crops and topsoil, in China. RESULTS: Totally, 14,045 COVID-19 cases were reported from 147 cities during 8 December 2019-13 December 2020 were included. Based on selenium content in crops, the case fatality rates (CFRs) gradually increased from 1.17% in non-selenium-deficient areas, to 1.28% in moderate-selenium-deficient areas, and further to 3.16% in severe-selenium-deficient areas (P = 0.002). Based on selenium content in topsoil, the CFRs gradually increased from 0.76% in non-selenium-deficient areas, to 1.70% in moderate-selenium-deficient areas, and further to 1.85% in severe-selenium-deficient areas (P < 0.001). The zero-inflated negative binomial regression model showed a significantly higher fatality risk in cities with severe-selenium-deficient selenium content in crops than non-selenium-deficient cities, with incidence rate ratio (IRR) of 3.88 (95% CIs: 1.21-12.52), which was further confirmed by regression fitting the association between CFR of COVID-19 and selenium content in topsoil, with the IRR of 2.38 (95% CIs: 1.14-4.98) for moderate-selenium-deficient cities and 3.06 (1.49-6.27) for severe-selenium-deficient cities. CONCLUSIONS: Regional selenium deficiency might be related to an increased CFR of COVID-19.

Larix kaempferi is an important economic and ecological species and a major afforestation species in north-eastern China. To date, no information has been reliably derived regarding full-length cDNA sequencing information on L. kaempferi. By single-molecule long-read isoform sequencing (SMRT-seq), here we report a total of 26,153,342 subreads (21.24 Gb) and 330,371 circular consensus sequence (CCS) reads after the modification of site mismatch, and 35,414 unigenes were successfully collected. To gain deeper insights into the molecular mechanisms of L. kaempferi response to drought stress, we combined Illumina HiSeq with SMRT-seq to decode full-length transcripts. In this study, we report 27 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in the perception and transmission of drought stress signals in L. kaempferi. A large number of DEGs responding to drought stress were detected in L. kaempferi, especially DEGs involved in the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging, lignin biosynthesis, and sugar metabolism, and DEGs encoding drought stress proteins. We detected 73 transcription factors (TFs) under drought stress, including AP2/ERF, bZIP, TCP, and MYB. This study provides basic full sequence resources for L. kaempferi research and will help us to better understand the functions of drought-resistance genes in L. kaempferi.","Li, Wenlong; Lee, Joobin; Yu, Sen; Wang, Fude; Lv, Wanqiu; Zhang, Xin; Li, Chenghao; Yang, Jingli",Planta,350,11

This meta-analysis aims to evaluate maternal and neonatal outcomes in covid-19 pregnancies and identify factors associated with perinatal viral transmission. Medline, Scopus, CENTRAL, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases were systematically searched to 3 June 2020. Overall, 16 observational studies and 44 case reports/series were included. Fever was the most frequent maternal symptom, followed by cough and shortness of breath, while about 15 % of infected were asymptomatic. Severe disease was estimated to occur in 11 % of women in case reports/series and in 7 % (95 % CI: 4 %-10 %) in observational studies. Two maternal deaths were reported. The rate of neonatal transmission did not differ between women with and without severe disease (OR: 1.94, 95 % CI: 0.50-7.60). Preterm birth occurred in 29.7 % and 16 % (95 % CI: 11 %-21 %) in data obtained from case series and observational studies, respectively. Stillbirth occurred in 3 cases and 2 neonatal deaths were observed. Vertical transmission was suspected in 4 cases. Fever was the most common neonatal symptom (40 %), followed by shortness of breath (28 %) and vomiting (24 %), while 20 % of neonates were totally asymptomatic. In conclusion, the maternal and neonatal clinical course the infection is typically mild, presenting low mortality rates. The risk of vertical transmission is suggested to be low and may not be affected by the severity of maternal disease. Further large-scale studies are needed to clarify the risk factors associated with viral transmission and severe infection in the neonatal population.","Bellos, Ioannis; Pandita, Aakash; Panza, Raffaella",Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol,350,24

Global Health Diplomacy and ""paradiplomacy"" have become relevant instruments and arenas for the challenges raised by the pandemic, especially for non-State or subnational actors. This Essay analyzes the case of the Brazilian state of Maranhão during the pandemic, which used a ""wartime operation"" to purchase more than a hundred mechanical ventilators on the international market, over the Federal Government's head, at a moment of fierce international competition for medical supplies and equipment. The Essay examines the principal aspects, contexts, reasons, factors, actors, and actions that contextualize the operation conducted by the state of Maranhão as an activity in paradiplomacy and Global Health Diplomacy by a subnational government in Brazil. We analyzed these concepts in light of the literature on the topic and studied the action by Maranhão based on cross-analysis of data from documents, statements, and news coverage. We conclude that the case of Maranhão illustrates the capacity of subnational bodies to respond to global emergencies, mainly in contexts of inefficacy or absence of the Federal executive, legitimizing independent action aimed at saving lives.","Alvarenga, Alexandre Andrade; Rocha, Erika Maria Sampaio; Filippon, Jonathan; Andrade, Maria Angélica Carvalho",Cad Saude Publica,350,5

Here, we aimed to identify the potential benefits of neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery for resectable PDAC. Methods: We reviewed radiologically resectable PDAC patients who received resection with curative intent at a tertiary hospital in South Korea between January 2012 and August 2019. A total of 202 patients underwent curative resection for resectable PDAC: 167 underwent surgical resection first during this period, and 35 received neoadjuvant chemotherapy/chemoradiation therapy followed by surgery. Resectable PDAC patients were subdivided, and 1:3 propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to reduce selection bias. Results: Compared with the group that received surgery first, the group that received neoadjuvant treatment followed by surgery had significantly smaller tumors (22.0 mm vs 27.0 mm, p=0.004), a smaller proportion of patients with postoperative pathologic T stage (p=0.026), a smaller proportion of patients with lymphovascular invasion (20.0% vs 40.7%, p=0.022), and a larger proportion of patients with negative resection margins (74.3% vs 51.5%, p=0.049). After PSM, the group that received neoadjuvant therapy had a significantly longer progression-free survival than those in the group that underwent surgery first (29.6 months vs 15.1 months, p=0.002). Overall survival was not significantly different between the two groups after PSM analysis. Conclusions: We observed significantly better surgical outcomes and progression-free survival with the addition of neoadjuvant therapy to the management of resectable PDAC. However, despite PSM, there was still selection bias due to the use of different regimens between the groups receiving surgery first and neoadjuvant therapy. Large homogeneous samples are needed in the future prospective studies.","Yoon, Min Sung; Lee, Hee Seung; Kang, Chang Moo; Lee, Woo Jung; Keum, Jiyoung; Sung, Min Je; Kim, Seung-Seob; Park, Mi-Suk; Jo, Jung Hyun; Chung, Moon Jae; Park, Jeong Youp; Park, Seung Woo; Song, Si Young; Hwang, Ho Kyoung; Bang, Seungmin",Gut liver (Online),350,1

However, partly due to damages associated with the pandemic and the ensuing euphoria over vaccines' arrival, some of the challenges are mostly being ignored or not recognized. This paper identifies some pitfalls and drawbacks in vaccine delivery. We argue that the somewhat unique tension between the speed of vaccine delivery and its scale can create opportunities for corrupt behavior that are often at odds with effective means to check abuse. While data on instances of abuse will emerge over time, it is useful to point out different avenues of abuse so that some preventive government actions can be undertaken. Specifically, we argue that the potential for out of turn delivery of vaccines and the stockpiling by unauthorized agents creates incentives for corruption, with the public or bureaucrats initiating corrupt transactions. An understanding of the potential avenues for corruption should guide the formulation of appropriate corruption-control policies and similar challenges that will be faced by policy makers in addressing future pandemics.","Goel, Rajeev K; Nelson, Michael A; Goel, Viraat Y",Journal of policy modeling,350,16

The study aims to understand what factors contribute to different COVID-19 impacts at the country level. METHODS: Multivariate statistical analyses were used to evaluate COVID-19 deaths and cases relative to nine other demographic and socioeconomic factors in all countries and regions of the world using data as of August 1, 2020. The factors analyzed in the study include a country's total COVID-19 deaths and cases per million population, per capita gross domestic product (GDP), population density, virus tests per million population, median age, government response stringency index, hospital beds availability per thousand population, extreme poverty rate, Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination rate, and diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP3) immunization rate. RESULTS: The study reveals that COVID-19 deaths per million population in a country most significantly correlates, inversely, with the country's BCG vaccination rate (r = - 0.50, p = 5.3e-5), and also significantly correlates a country's per capita GDP (r = 0.39, p = 7.4e-3) and median age (r = 0.30, p = 0.042), while COVID-19 cases per million population significantly correlate with per capita GDP and tests per thousand population. To control for possible confounding effects of age, the correlation was assessed in countries propensity score matched for age. The inverse correlation between BCG vaccination rates and COVID-19 case (r = - 0.30, p = 0.02) and death (r = - 0.42, p = 0.0007) remained significant among the top 61 countries with the highest median age.

If so, the prevalence of asthma in subjects diagnosed with COVID-19 should be lower than in the general population. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of asthma in Mexican children and adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: A public database of the Epidemiological Surveillance System for Viral Respiratory Disease in Mexico was analyzed. Those who underwent the real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction-SARS-CoV-2 (rtRT-PCR-SARS-CoV-2) test from February 27 to June 21, 2020, were included. In addition to the prevalence of asthma, some factors associated with it were investigated. RESULTS: Data from 417,366 subjects were analyzed. Asthma prevalence in children, adults, and global were 3.7%, 3.3%, and 3.3%, respectively. Although the asthma prevalence was lower in SARS-CoV-2 positive over negative patients, significant differences were only found in adults (2.8% vs. 3.7% respectively; odds ratio (OR) = 0.74; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.71-0.77); but not in children (3.5% vs. 3.8%, respectively; OR = 0.91; 95%CI: 0.76-1.10). Multivariate analysis showed in younger than 18 years that girls and immunosuppression were factors associated with a decrease in the odds to develop asthma. In adults, asthma was positively associated with females, obesity, smoking, immunosuppression, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, arterial hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of asthma in child and adult were lower than those previously reported. Our study seems to support the hypothesis that asthma patients have a lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

In laboratory tests, serum levels of liver test markers notably transaminase, gamma-glutamyl transferase and total bilirubin were significantly higher in severe patients with COVID-19 infection. The use of certain drugs especially lopinavir and ritonavir showed an association with the progression of liver damage in severe cases. Available data suggest that liver injury in COVID-19 patients may result from direct effect by the virus, immune-mediated inflammation or drug-induced toxicity. Some studies demonstrated that COVID-19 patients with pre-existing liver disease are at higher risk for hospitalizations and mortality. Therefore, the impact of pre-existing liver disease on treatment and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 should be determined. Large-scale clinical studies are needed to identify the causes of liver injury in patients with COVID-19 infection.","Ali, Nurshad",Front. Med.,350,24

Also, HFD consumption can alter hydrogen sulfide (H2S) metabolism. H2S is an important signaling molecule with antioxidant effects that regulates multiple functions in the brain. In the present study, we investigated the effect of sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS, an H2S donor) on cognitive impairment and oxidative stress changes induced by HFD consumption. Following 11 weeks of HFD regimes in Wistar rats, elevated plus-maze (EPM), Morris water maze (MWM), and passive avoidance learning (PAL) tasks were used to evaluate the anxiety-like behavior and spatial and passive learning and memory, respectively. Daily intraperitoneal injection of NaHS was done during the dietary regimen. Serum and hippocampal oxidative stress biomarkers (malondialdehyde (MDA), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and total oxidant status (TOS)) were measured. We demonstrated that treatment with NaHS ameliorated the impairment in the retrieval of reference memory and passive avoidance learning. Moreover, HFD increased anxiety-like behavior, which was reversed by the administration of NaHS. Additionally, the increase in MDA and TOS and the decrease in TAC induced by HFD in the serum and hippocampus were significantly reduced following administration of NaHS. These results indicate that NaHS could significantly ameliorate HFD-induced spatial and passive learning and memory impairment and anxiety-like behavior, at least in part, via its antioxidant activities. Therefore, the administration of NaHS can provide a therapeutic approach for HFD-induced memory impairment.","Habibitabar, Elahe; Moridi, Heresh; Shateri, Hossein; Karimi, Seyed Asaad; Salehi, Iraj; Komaki, Alireza; Sarihi, Abdolrahman",Brain Res Bull,350,1

Detecting COVID-19 at an early stage is essential to reduce the mortality risk of the patients. In this study, a cascaded system is proposed to segment the lung, detect, localize, and quantify COVID-19 infections from computed tomography (CT) images Furthermore, the system classifies the severity of COVID-19 as mild, moderate, severe, or critical based on the percentage of infected lungs. An extensive set of experiments were performed using state-of-the-art deep Encoder-Decoder Convolutional Neural Networks (ED-CNNs), UNet, and Feature Pyramid Network (FPN), with different backbone (encoder) structures using the variants of DenseNet and ResNet. The conducted experiments showed the best performance for lung region segmentation with Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 97.19% and Intersection over Union (IoU) of 95.10% using U-Net model with the DenseNet 161 encoder. Furthermore, the proposed system achieved an elegant performance for COVID-19 infection segmentation with a DSC of 94.13% and IoU of 91.85% using the FPN model with the DenseNet201 encoder. The achieved performance is significantly superior to previous methods for COVID-19 lesion localization. Besides, the proposed system can reliably localize infection of various shapes and sizes, especially small infection regions, which are rarely considered in recent studies. Moreover, the proposed system achieved high COVID-19 detection performance with 99.64% sensitivity and 98.72% specificity. Finally, the system was able to discriminate between different severity levels of COVID-19 infection over a dataset of 1,110 subjects with sensitivity values of 98.3%, 71.2%, 77.8%, and 100% for mild, moderate, severe, and critical infections, respectively.","Qiblawey, Yazan; Tahir, Anas; Chowdhury, Muhammad E.

Identification of clinical phenotypes may facilitate tailored therapy and improve outcomes. The purpose of this study is to identify specific clinical phenotypes across COVID-19 patients and compare admission characteristics and outcomes. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of COVID-19 patients from March 7, 2020 to August 25, 2020 at 14 U.S. hospitals. Ensemble clustering was performed on 33 variables collected within 72 hours of admission. Principal component analysis was performed to visualize variable contributions to clustering. Multinomial regression models were fit to compare patient comorbidities across phenotypes. Multivariable models were fit to estimate associations between phenotype and in-hospital complications and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: The database included 1,022 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Three clinical phenotypes were identified (I, II, III), with 236 [23.1%] patients in phenotype I, 613 [60%] patients in phenotype II, and 173 [16.9%] patients in phenotype III. Patients with respiratory comorbidities were most commonly phenotype III (p = 0.002), while patients with hematologic, renal, and cardiac (all p<0.001) comorbidities were most commonly phenotype I. Adjusted odds of respiratory, renal, hepatic, metabolic (all p<0.001), and hematological (p = 0.02) complications were highest for phenotype I. Phenotypes I and II were associated with 7.30-fold (HR:7.30, 95% CI:(3.11-17.17), p<0.001) and 2.57-fold (HR:2.57, 95% CI:(1.10-6.00), p = 0.03) increases in hazard of death relative to phenotype III.

However, approaches that account for survival outcomes are relatively limited. Survival data are frequently encountered across diverse medical applications, \textit{i.e.}, drug development, risk profiling, and clinical trials, and such data are also relevant in fields like manufacturing (for equipment monitoring). When the outcome of interest is time-to-event, special precautions for handling censored events need to be taken, as ignoring censored outcomes may lead to biased estimates. We propose a theoretically grounded unified framework for counterfactual inference applicable to survival outcomes. Further, we formulate a nonparametric hazard ratio metric for evaluating average and individualized treatment effects. Experimental results on real-world and semi-synthetic datasets, the latter which we introduce, demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms competitive alternatives in both survival-outcome predictions and treatment-effect estimation.","Chapfuwa, Paidamoyo; Assaad, Serge; Zeng, Shuxi; Pencina, Michael; Carin, Lawrence; Henao, Ricardo",,350,18

We found that the late gestation placental expression pattern of TMPRSS2 (the spike proteinase required for SARS-CoV-2 cellular infection), is usually absent in the trophoblast but rarely, weakly expressed in the placental endothelium. We now show the developmental protein expression patterns of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 by immunohistochemistry throughout gestation, from first through third trimester. We found TMPRSS2 expression was rarely detectable in villous endothelium and very rarely detectable in the ST across gestation. We found ACE2 expression varied during gestation with circumferential ST expression more common in early gestations and polarized expression more common in later gestation. Although this study is small, these preliminary results suggest that earlier gestation pregnancies may be more vulnerable to infection than later gestation pregnancies.","Roberts, Drucilla J; Bebell, Lisa M; Edlow, Andrea G",J. infect. dis,350,1

Whether COVID-19 risk is associated with differences in vitamin D levels of 30 ng/mL or greater is not known. Objective: To examine whether COVID-19 test results are associated with differences in vitamin D levels of 30 ng/mL or greater, including for White individuals and for Black individuals. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study was conducted at an academic medical center in Chicago, Illinois. Participants included individuals with data on vitamin D level within 365 days before COVID-19 testing, which was conducted from March 3 to December 30, 2020. Data were analyzed from September 11, 2020, to February 5, 2021. Exposures: The last vitamin D level before COVID-19 testing was categorized as less than 20 ng/mL (ie, deficient), 20 to less than 30 ng/mL (ie, insufficient), 30 to less than 40 ng/mL, or 40 ng/mL or greater. Treatment was defined by vitamin D type and dose 14 days before COVID-19 testing and treatment changes after last vitamin D level. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was a positive result for COVID-19 in polymerase chain reaction testing. Multivariable analyses tested whether previously measured vitamin D level was associated with having test results positive for COVID-19 in White individuals and in Black individuals, controlling for months and treatment changes since the vitamin D level was measured, as well as demographic characteristics and comorbidity indicators. Results: A total of 4638 individuals (mean [SD] age 52.8 [19.5] years; 3205 [69%] women) had data for a vitamin D level within 1 year before COVID-19 testing, including 2288 (49%) Black individuals, 1999 (43%) White individuals, and 351 individuals (8%) who were another race/ethnicity (eg, Asian, Mideast Indian, >1 race). Stratified by vitamin D level, 1251 individuals (27%) had less than 20 ng/mL, 1267 individuals (27%) had 20 to less than 30 ng/mL, 1023 individuals (22%) had 30 to less than 40 ng/mL, and 1097 individuals (24%) had 40 ng/mL or greater. Lower vitamin D levels were more common in Black individuals (<20 ng/mL: 829 of 2288 Black individuals [36%]) than White individuals (<20 ng/mL: 315 of 1999 White individuals [16%]). A total of 333 individuals (7%) had test results positive for COVID-19, including 102 White individuals (5%) and 211 Black individuals (9%). Multivariate analysis controlling for time since last vitamin D level measurement was used to estimate the outcomes associated with levels 14 days before COVID-19 testing. A positive test result for COVID-19 was not significantly associated with vitamin D levels in White individuals but was associated with vitamin D levels in Black individuals (compared with &#8805;40 ng/mL: <20 ng/mL incidence rate ratio [IRR], 2.55 [95% CI, 1.26-5.15]; P = .009; 20 to <30 ng/mL IRR, 1.69 [95% CI, 0.75-3.84]; P = .21; 30 to <40 ng/mL IRR, 2.64 [95% CI, 1.24-5.66]; P = .01). Stratified by vitamin D level, estimated COVID-19 positivity rates in Black individuals were 9.72% (95% CI, 6.74%-13.41%) for individuals with a vitamin D level less than 20 ng/mL, 6.47% (95% CI, 3.33%-10.28%) for individuals with a vitamin D level of 20 to less than 30 ng/mL, 10.10% (95% CI, 6.00%-15.47%) for individuals with a vitamin D level of 30 to less than 40 ng/mL, and 3.82% (95% CI, 1.78%-6.68%) for individuals with a vitamin D level of 40 ng/mL or higher. Multivariate analysis in individuals with a vitamin D level of 30 ng/mL or greater found that the IRR of a positive COVID-19 test result was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.94-0.99; P = .008) per 1-ng/mL increase in vitamin D overall and 0.95 (95% CI, 0.91-0.98; P = .003) per 1-ng/mL increase in vitamin D in Black individuals. Conclusions and Relevance: In this single-center retrospective cohort study, COVID-19 risk increased among Black individuals with vitamin D level less than 40 ng/mL compared with those with 40 ng/mL or greater and decreased with increasing levels among individuals with levels greater than 30 ng/mL. No significant associations were noted for White individuals. Randomized clinical trials should examine whether increasing vitamin D level to greater than 40 ng/mL affects COVID-19 risk.","Meltzer, David O; Best, Thomas J; Zhang, Hui; Vokes, Tamara; Arora, Vineet M; Solway, Julian",JAMA Netw Open,350,20

Several studies have indicated that densely populated urban environments and the heavy dependence on traffic could increase the potential spread of COVID-19. This study investigated the association between changes in traffic volume and the spread of COVID-19 in South Korea. METHODS: This study analyzed the daily national traffic and traffic trend for 3 months from January 1, 2020. Traffic data were measured using 6307 vehicle detection system (VDS). This study analyzed the difference in traffic levels between 2019 and 2020. Non-linear regression was performed to analyze the change in traffic trend in 2020. The relationship between traffic and confirmed COVID-19 cases was analyzed using single linear regression. RESULTS: The mean daily nationwide level of traffic for the first 3 months of 2020 was 143 655 563 vehicles, which was 9.7% lower than the same period in 2019 (159 044 566 vehicles). All regions showed a decreasing trend in traffic in February, which shifted to an increasing trend from March. In Incheon there was a positive, but insignificant, linear relationship between increasing numbers of newly confirmed cases and increasing traffic (ß = 43 146; p = 0.056). CONCLUSIONS: Numbers of newly confirmed COVID-19 patients have been decreasing since March, while the traffic has been increasing. The fact that traffic is increasing indicates greater contact between people, which in turn increases the risk of further COVID-19 spread. Therefore, the government will need to devise suitable policies, such as total social distancing.","Lee, Hocheol; Park, Sung Jong; Lee, Ga Ram; Kim, Ji Eon; Lee, Ji Ho; Jung, Yeseul; Nam, Eun Woo",Int J Infect Dis,350,20

First, we designed and validated ten multiple-choice questions to identify knowledge gaps among healthcare workers. Within one month of the online test and curriculum offering, 5533 staff had completed the test, with a completion rate of 84.97%. There were 2618 healthcare workers who answered the pre-test 100% correctly. Those who did not answer the pre-test 100% correctly took multiple tests after learning through the online teaching materials. Eventually, 5214 staff passed the test (pre-test or post-test with 100% correct answers). The result showed that all staff had a low correct rate for personal protective equipment (PPE) use recommendations. The Infection Control Center conducted training sessions for hospital staff on how to wear protective clothing. Information on the selection and use of PPE for infection prevention was provided, and participants were allowed time to practice and familiarize themselves with the correct way to wear PPE. Moreover, the Department of Education and Research continued updating the online learning materials based on the most important updated peer-reviewed published articles. The attending teaching physicians helped to search, translate, and take notes on articles in the local language (traditional Chinese) for other colleagues to read easily. We expect to increase learning opportunities for healthcare workers, even during uncertain times such as the current coronavirus pandemic through (1) the hospital-wide course announcements, (2) the continuous placement of test questions and learning files on the digital learning platform, (3) the placement of journal highlights in cloud folders, and (4) the use of the digital learning platform on mobile phones accessible outside the hospital.","Chiu, Ting-Fang; Chu, Dachen; Huang, Sheng-Jean; Chang, Mengju; Liu, Yining; Lee, Jason Jiunshiou",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),350,2

The aim of this study was to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the management of HCC patients within six French referral centers of the metropolitan area of Paris. Materials and methods: We performed a multicenter, retrospective, cross-sectional study on the management of patients affected by HCC during the first six weeks of COVID-19 pandemic (exposed), compared to the same period in 2019 (unexposed). Were included all patients discussed in multidisciplinary tumor meeting (MTB) and/or undergoing radiological or surgical programmed procedure during the study period, in a curative or palliative intent. Endpoints were the number of patients with a modification in the treatment strategy, or a delay in decision-to-treatment. Results: After screening, n=670 patients were included (n=293 Exposed to COVID, n=377 Unexposed to COVID). A decrease of the numbers of patients with HCC presented in MTB in 2020 (p=0.034) and with a first diagnosis of HCC (n=104 Exposed to COVID, n=143 Unexposed to COVID, p=0.083) was find. Modification in the treatment strategy was observed in 13.1% of patients, with no differences between the two periods. Nevertheless 21.5% versus 9.5% of patients experienced a treatment delay longer than 1 month in 2020 compared to 2019 (p<0.001). In 2020, 7.1% (21/293) of patients had a diagnosis of an active COVID-19 infection: 11 (52.4%) were hospitalized, and 4 (19.1%) died. Conclusions: In a metropolitan area highly impacted by COVID-19 pandemic, we observed a decreased number of cases of HCC, and similar rates of modification in treatment strategy, but with a treatment delay significantly longer in 2020 versus 2019.","Amaddeo, Giuliana; Brustia, Raffaele; Allaire, Manon; Lequoy, Marie; Hollande, Clémence; Regnault, Hélène; Blaise, Lorraine; Ganne-Carrié, Nathalie; Séror, Olivier; Larrey, Edouard; Lim, Chetana; Scatton, Olivier; El Mouhadi, Sanaa; Ozenne, Violaine; Paye, François; Balladur, Pierre; Dohan, Anthony; Massault, Pierre-Philippe; Pol, Stanislas; Dioguardi Burgio, Marco; Vilgrain, Valérie; Sepulveda, Ailton; Cauchy, Francois; Luciani, Alain; Sommacale, Daniele; Leroy, Vincent; Roudot-Thoraval, Francoise; Bouattour, Mohamed; Nault, Jean-Charles",JHEP Rep,350,24

Despite the pandemic is raging in most parts of the world, in a few countries COVID-19 epidemics subsided due to successful implementations of intervention measures. A unifying perspective of the beginnings, middle stages, and endings of such completed COVID-19 epidemics is developed based on the order parameter and eigenvalue concepts of nonlinear physics, in general, and synergetics, in particular. To this end, a standard susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) epidemiological model is used. It is shown that COVID-19 epidemic outbreaks follow a suitably defined SEIR order parameter. Intervention measures switch the eigenvalue of the order parameter from a positive to a negative value, and in doing so, stabilize the COVID-19 disease-free state. The subsiding of COVID-19 epidemics eventually follows the remnant of the order parameter of the infection dynamical system. These considerations are illustrated for the COVID-19 epidemic in Thailand from January to May 2020. The decay of effective contact rates throughout the three epidemic stages is demonstrated. Evidence for the sign-switching of the dominant eigenvalue is given and the order parameter and its stage-3 remnant are identified. The presumed impacts of interventions measures implemented in Thailand are discussed in this context.","Frank, T D; Chiangga, S",Phys. biol,350,32

We aimed to determine the factors associated with vaccine coverage for both vaccines and documented the vaccine effectiveness of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in a cohort of health-care workers undergoing regular asymptomatic testing. METHODS: The SIREN study is a prospective cohort study among staff (aged &#8805;18 years) working in publicly-funded hospitals in the UK. Participants were assigned into either the positive cohort (antibody positive or history of infection [indicated by previous positivity of antibody or PCR tests]) or the negative cohort (antibody negative with no previous positive test) at the beginning of the follow-up period. Baseline risk factors were collected at enrolment, symptom status was collected every 2 weeks, and vaccination status was collected through linkage to the National Immunisations Management System and questionnaires. Participants had fortnightly asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing and monthly antibody testing, and all tests (including symptomatic testing) outside SIREN were captured. Data cutoff for this analysis was Feb 5, 2021. The follow-up period was Dec 7, 2020, to Feb 5, 2021. The primary outcomes were vaccinated participants (binary ever vacinated variable; indicated by at least one vaccine dose recorded by at least one of the two vaccination data sources) for the vaccine coverage analysis and SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by a PCR test for the vaccine effectiveness analysis. We did a mixed-effect logistic regression analysis to identify factors associated with vaccine coverage. We used a piecewise exponential hazard mixed-effects model (shared frailty-type model) using a Poisson distribution to calculate hazard ratios to compare time-to-infection in unvaccinated and vaccinated participants and estimate the impact of the BNT162b2 vaccine on all PCR-positive infections (asymptomatic and symptomatic). This study is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN11041050, and is ongoing. FINDINGS: 23 324 participants from 104 sites (all in England) met the inclusion criteria for this analysis and were enrolled. Included participants had a median age of 46·1 years (IQR 36·0-54·1) and 19 692 (84%) were female; 8203 (35%) were assigned to the positive cohort at the start of the analysis period, and 15 121 (65%) assigned to the negative cohort. Total follow-up time was 2 calendar months and 1 106 905 person-days (396 318 vaccinated and 710 587 unvaccinated). Vaccine coverage was 89% on Feb 5, 2021, 94% of whom had BNT162b2 vaccine. Significantly lower coverage was associated with previous infection, gender, age, ethnicity, job role, and Index of Multiple Deprivation score. During follow-up, there were 977 new infections in the unvaccinated cohort, an incidence density of 14 infections per 10 000 person-days; the vaccinated cohort had 71 new infections 21 days or more after their first dose (incidence density of eight infections per 10 000 person-days) and nine infections 7 days after the second dose (incidence density four infections per 10 000 person-days). In the unvaccinated cohort, 543 (56%) participants had typical COVID-19 symptoms and 140 (14%) were asymptomatic on or 14 days before their PCR positive test date, compared with 29 (36%) with typical COVID-19 symptoms and 15 (19%) asymptomatic in the vaccinated cohort. A single dose of BNT162b2 vaccine showed vaccine effectiveness of 70% (95% CI 55-85) 21 days after first dose and 85% (74-96) 7 days after two doses in the study population. INTERPRETATION: Our findings show that the BNT162b2 vaccine can prevent both symptomatic and asymptomatic infection in working-age adults. This cohort was vaccinated when the dominant variant in circulation was B1.1.7 and shows effectiveness against this variant.

Given the impaired lung function caused by COVID-19 may exacerbate the symptoms of patients already having preexisting opioids or central nervous system stimulants use disorder. This narrative review highlights the risks of interactions between COVID-19 and SUD. Methods: This article has systematically reviewed and collated relevant papers and articles identified through PubMed focusing on SUD and COVID-19. Results: SUD is characterized by an array of combined mental, physical, and behavioral symptoms, which is undoubtedly of great public health concern especially in the context of the recent advent of the COVID-19 pandemic. The myriad of physiological changes caused by COVID-19 and SUD may be additive or synergistic on various organ functions, hence this review has highlighted potential challenges and possible outcomes because of these interactions. Systematic delineation to parse out the combined COVID-19 and SUD pathology on a given organ function is crucial. Moreover, the primary measures to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic like home confinement and lack of social support may be a significant predictor of relapse in already sober individuals, thus alternate methodologies may be needed to confine this problem. Conclusion: This review highlights the importance of the intertwined epidemics interactions and proposes early measures to recognize the scope of problem at the individual level to prevent future challenges.","Salahuddin, M.; Manzar, M.

In the wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries have implemented various NPIs for infection control and mitigation. However, the stringency of the NPIs and the resulting impact among different countries remain unclear due to the lack of quantitative factors. In this study we took a further step to incorporate the effect of the NPIs into the pandemic dynamics model using the concept of policy intensity factor (PIF). This idea enables us to characterize the transition rates as time varying quantities instead of constant values, and thus capturing the dynamical behavior of the basic reproduction number variation in the pandemic. By leveraging a great amount of data reported by the governments and the World Health Organization, we projected the dynamics of the pandemic for the major economies in the world, including the numbers of infected, susceptible, and recovered cases, as well as the pandemic durations. It is observed that the proposed variable-rate susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (VR-SEIR) model fits and projects the pandemic dynamics very well. We further showed that the resulting PIFs correlate with the stringency of NPIs, which allows us to project the final affected numbers of people in those countries when their current NPIs have been imposed for 90, 180, 360 days. It provides a quantitative insight into the effectiveness of the implemented NPIs, and sheds a new light on minimizing both affected people from COVID-19 and the economic impact.","He, Jingjing; Guan, Xuefei; Duan, Xiaochang; Shen, Tian; Lin, Jing",,350,16

Here, we tested the efficacy of written benefit finding, delivered online during the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown, on mood and physical symptoms. We also investigated perseverative thinking as a moderator of these effects. Design. A quantitative longitudinal design was employed. Main Outcome Measures. Participants (n = 91) completed self-report measures of anxiety, depression, stress and physical symptoms at baseline, and two weeks after being randomised to complete three consecutive days of writing about the positive thoughts and feelings they experienced during the pandemic (written benefit finding) or to unemotively describe the events of the previous day (control). State anxiety was measured immediately before and after writing. Perseverative thinking was measured at baseline. Results. Anxiety and depression symptoms decreased between baseline and the two week follow-up, but did not differ significantly between the two conditions. Perseverative thinking was negatively associated with changes in symptoms of anxiety, depression and stress, but did not moderate any writing effects. There was a significant reduction in state anxiety in the written benefit finding condition. Conclusions.

Results: Twenty patients were included. The median age was 49 years (interquartile range [IQR] 32.25-69), and 60% were male. Ten patients presented ST-segment elevation on the ECG. All patients had elevated serum levels of troponin T or I, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (median 3436 ng/L, IQR 1315-12054) and C-reactive protein (median 33 mg/L, IQR 18-94). Interleukin-6 was measured in three patients, presenting elevated values as well. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was severely impaired in 60% of the patients. Half of the patients received corticosteroids, 43.7% antivirals and 31.3% hydroxychloroquine. Moreover, 15.8% of patients underwent mechanical circulatory support. Most patients (90.9%) recovered heart function with LVEF above 40%. In-hospital mortality rate was 15.8%, the main cause of death being bacterial septic shock (75%). Conclusion: Several cases of coronavirus-related myocarditis have been reported. The clinical presentation was heterogeneous. The vast majority of patients were treated with steroids and antivirals. Most patients recovered cardiac function;however, mortality was relatively high.","Burgos, L. M.; Ramirez, A. G.; Diez, M.",Journal of the Practice of Cardiovascular Sciences,350,10

Nevertheless, responses to the pandemic exhibit a stark ideological divide, with political conservatives (versus liberals/progressives) expressing less concern about the virus and less behavioral compliance with efforts to combat it. Drawing from decades of research on the psychological underpinnings of ideology, in four studies (total N = 4441) we examine the factors that contribute to the ideological gap in pandemic response-across domains including personality (e.g., empathic concern), attitudes (e.g., trust in science), information (e.g., COVID-19 knowledge), vulnerability (e.g., preexisting medical conditions), demographics (e.g., education, income) and environment (e.g., local COVID-19 infection rates). This work provides insight into the most proximal drivers of this ideological divide and also helps fill a long-standing theoretical and empirical gap regarding how these various ideological differences shape responses to complex real-world sociopolitical events. Among our key findings are the central role of attitude- and belief-related factors (e.g., trust in science and trust in Trump)-and the relatively weaker influence of several domain-general personality factors (empathic concern, disgust sensitivity, conspiratorial ideation). We conclude by considering possible explanations for these findings and their broader implications for our understanding of political ideology.","Ruisch, Benjamin Coe; Moore, Courtney; Granados Samayoa, Javier; Boggs, Shelby; Ladanyi, Jesse; Fazio, Russell",Political psychology,350,7

Utilizing poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) in the molecular delivery approach, the formed emulsion nanovesicle (TMB-NPs@PLGA) exhibits an enrichment of the collective signal molecules in a single antibody-antigen conjugation. A specific antibody-conjugated TMB-NPs@PLGA forms an immunocomplex sandwich structure upon the addition of influenza virus (IV)/A. The addition of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) dissolves the PLGA nanovesicles, releasing the encapsulated TMB-NPs. Sequentially, the TMB-NPs release TMB molecules upon the addition of DMSO. The released TMB is catalytically oxidized by H2O2 with self-assembled protein-inorganic nanoflowers, where copper nanoflowers (CuNFs) acted as the nanozyme. The developed immunoassay demonstrates high sensitivity for IV/A with a limit of detection (LOD) as low as 32.37 fg mL-1 and 54.97 fg mL-1 in buffer and serum, respectively. For practical needs, a clinically isolated IV/A/H3N2 and spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 were detected with the LODs of 17 pfu mL-1 and 143 fg mL-1, respectively.

Global organizations acknowledge disruption of classical educational processes and emergency transition to distance learning during the pandemic. Scientific literature examines accessibility of online education, alternative forms of distance learning, and the pandemic-induced financial constraints on universities inhibiting new construction, social support for students, scholarship application, professional development of faculty members, and research growth. The pandemic illuminated the issue of inequality in education, which worsened as a result of emergency transition to online studies. In particular, researchers focus on the most vulnerable groups of students, such as children from low-income families, children from migrant backgrounds, and students with disabilities. Projects aimed at studying the digitalization of education account for the biggest chunk of research inspired by the new pandemic reality. A number of studies discuss not just a formal transition to distance learning but a major technological turn that allows using the unique opportunities provided by digital technologies, which is especially important when teaching medical students. Theoretical inquiry is a distinctive feature of scientific discourse, as compared to the discourse of international expert and analytical reports on the problems of education in the context of the COVID‑19 pandemic. Research on changes to the learning process makes it possible to reconstruct the direct and indirect, as well as latent, threats of the pandemic. © 2021, Mir Rossii All Rights Reserved.","Radina, N.; Balakina, J.",Mir Rossii,350,16

This paper examines demographic, economic, political, health, and socio-cultural differentials in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. The health systems need to be strengthened through extending the health workforce by mobilizing and engaging the diaspora, and implementing the International Health Regulations (2005) core capacities. In the absence of adequate social protection and welfare programs targeting the poor during the pandemic, sub-Saharan African countries need to put in place flexible but effective policies and legislation approaches that harness and formalise the informal trade and remove supply chain barriers. This could include strengthening cross-border trade facilities such as adequate pro-poor, gender-sensitive, and streamlined cross-border customs, tax regimes, and information flow. The emphasis should be on cross-border infrastructure that not only facilitates trade through efficient border administration but can also effectively manage cross-border health threats. There is an urgent need to strengthen social protection systems to make them responsive to crises, and embed them within human rights-based approaches to better support vulnerable populations and enact health and social security benefits.

The purpose of this study was to identify potential financial implications of continued telehealth use in hand and wrist surgery clinical practice. METHODS: Two hundred telehealth visits were randomly selected and matched 1:1 based on primary diagnosis code to in-person visits. Medical and billing records were reviewed to compare visit complexities, total visit charges, work relative value units (wRVUs), and approved insurance reimbursement. Postoperative visits and visits with radiographic evaluation were excluded. RESULTS: Level 4 visits were more common with in-person encounters compared to telehealth (11% vs 2%, respectively), and level 1 and 2 visits were more common with telehealth compared to in-person encounters (14% vs 6%, respectively). Twenty-seven in-person visits (13%) had at least 1 additional procedure code billed. The mean total visit charge was 26% less in telehealth compared to in-person. Based on the primary procedure code alone, the sum of wRVUs was 15.1 points less in the telehealth cohort compared to in-person (per visit average, 1.1 [telehealth] vs 1.2 [in-person]). The 28 additional services provided during in-person visits accounted for an added 20.7 wRVUs. Unpaid claims were more common among telehealth encounters (8% [telehealth] vs 3% [in-person]). CONCLUSIONS: Higher complexity visits and visits with additional procedural codes billed were more common with in-person visits. This led to a lower number of total wRVUs and lower total visit charges among the included telehealth visits compared to the matched in-person controls. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: It is important to understand and consider the long-term financial impact of telehealth implementation. Practices must develop strategies to incorporate radiographic evaluation into telehealth visits and effectively stratify those patients that may require procedural interventions for in-person visits. Understanding the economic implications of this changing care delivery paradigm, providers can continue to provide telehealth services while protecting the financial sustainability of hand surgery practices.","Tadley, Madeline; Henry, Tyler W; Horan, Dylan P; Beredjiklian, Pedro K",J. hand sur.

CONCLUSION: Laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 among vaccinated HCWs soon after the second vaccination indicates that HCWs remain at risk of COVID-19. Therefore, the presence of symptoms soon after full vaccination cannot be considered as vaccine-related symptoms, and regular COVID-19 testing should be conducted among HCWs.","Cucunawangsih, Cucunawangsih; Wijaya, Ratna Sari; Lugito, Nata Pratama Hardjo; Suriapranata, Ivet",Int J Infect Dis,350,16

One of the hardest challenges in the fight against COVID-19 is the development of wide-scale, effective, and rapid laboratory tests to control disease severity, progression, and possible sudden worsening. Monitoring patients in real-time is highly demanded in this pandemic era when physicians need reliable and quantitative tools to prioritize patients’ access to intensive care departments. In this regard, salivary biomarkers are extremely promising, as they allow for the fast and non-invasive collection of specimens and can be repeated multiple times. Methods: We compare salivary levels of immunoglobulin A subclasses (IgA1 and IgA2) and free light chains (kFLC and λFLC) in a cohort of 29 SARS-CoV-2 patients and 21 healthy subjects. Results: We found that each biomarker differs significantly between the two groups, with p-values ranging from 10−8 to 10−4. A Receiving Operator Curve analysis shows that λFLC level is the best-suited candidate to discriminate the two groups (AUC = 0.96), with an accuracy of 0.94 (0.87–1.00 95% CI), a precision of 0.91 (0.81–1.00 95% CI), a sensitivity of 1.00 (0.96–1.00 95% CI), and a specificity of 0.86 (0.70–1.00 95% CI). Conclusion: These results suggest λFLC as an ideal indicator of patient conditions. This hypothesis is strengthened by the consideration that the λFLC half-life (approximately 6 h) is significantly shorter than the IgA one (21 days), thus confirming the potential of λFLC for effectively monitoring patients’ fluctuation in real-time.","Napodano, Cecilia Callà Cinzia Fiorita Antonella Marino Mariapaola Taddei Eleonora Di Cesare Tiziana Passali Giulio Cesare Di Santo Riccardo Stefanile Annunziata Fantoni Massimo Urbani Andrea Paludetti Gaetano Rapaccini Gian Ludovico Ciasca Gabriele Basile Umberto",Journal of Personalized Medicine,350,6

While purpose-built pulse oximeters can provide accurate blood-oxygen saturation (SpO$_2$) readings that allow for diagnosis of hypoxemia, enabling this capability in unmodified smartphone cameras via a software update could give more people access to important information about their health, as well as improve physicians' ability to remotely diagnose and treat respiratory conditions. In this work, we take a step towards this goal by performing the first clinical development validation on a smartphone-based SpO$_2$ sensing system using a varied fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO$_2$) protocol, creating a clinically relevant validation dataset for solely smartphone-based methods on a wide range of SpO$_2$ values (70%-100%) for the first time. This contrasts with previous studies, which evaluated performance on a far smaller range (85%-100%). We build a deep learning model using this data to demonstrate accurate reporting of SpO$_2$ level with an overall MAE=5.00% SpO$_2$ and identifying positive cases of low SpO$_2$<90% with 81% sensitivity and 79% specificity. We ground our analysis with a summary of recent literature in smartphone-based SpO2 monitoring, and we provide the data from the FiO$_2$ study in open-source format, so that others may build on this work.","Hoffman, Jason S.; Viswanath, Varun; Ding, Xinyi; Thompson, Matthew J.; Larson, Eric C.; Patel, Shwetak N.; Wang, Edward",,350,1

Here we describe a case of AIHA, refractory to both standard and experimental therapies, complicated by multiorgan failure, and rapidly leading to death. CASE REPORT AND RESULTS: A 65 year-old man who presented with progressive dyspnea and jaundice was found to have hemolytic anemia. Diagnostic work-up revealed a positive direct antiglobulin test and a strong pan-reactive antibody in the plasma reacting to a titer of 1:1024 with strongest reactivity at 37 °C Coombs' phase with reagent anti-IgG. The red cell eluate contained a pan-agglutinin. The patient received multiple lines of treatment including glucocorticoids, intravenous immunoglobulin, rituximab, eculizumab, splenectomy and etoposide. Despite these interventions, he continued to experience brisk hemolysis and remained transfusion dependent. Repeat testing on day 16 demonstrated persistent high titer IgG auto-antibodies, suggesting minimal suppressive effect of therapy. His course was complicated by acute renal and liver failure, venous thrombosis, and worsening coagulopathy, and he ultimately died from multiorgan failure on day 18. CONCLUSION: Severe cases of AIHA can result in multiorgan failure and a fatal outcome. The rapid development of liver failure in this setting has been described in only few case reports to date, and represents an important complication for clinicians to be aware of when treating patients with AIHA.","Anandappa, Annabelle J; Stefely, Jonathan A; Hasserjian, Robert P; Dzik, Walter H; Waheed, Anem",Transfusion,350,6

Less is known, however, about the underlying processes. The present study addressed this gap in the literature by examining how mindfulness would mitigate self-stigma and, in turn, alleviate affective symptoms among lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals. METHODS: A total of 401 LGB individuals from Hong Kong, China, provided cross-sectional questionnaire data on mindfulness, positive reappraisal, negative rumination, self-stigma content, self-stigma process, disempowerment, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms. Structural equation modeling and Bootstrap analyses were conducted to analyze the relations among the variables. RESULTS: Structural equation modeling showed that mindfulness was associated with increased positive reappraisal and reduced negative rumination, which were, in turn, associated with lower levels of self-stigma content and process, respectively. Moreover, lower levels of self-stigma content and process were associated with a reduced sense of disempowerment, which was, in turn, associated with lower levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms. Bootstrap analyses further demonstrated that mindfulness had significant indirect effects on depressive and anxiety symptoms via positive reappraisal, self-stigma content, and disempowerment and via negative rumination, self-stigma process, and disempowerment. CONCLUSIONS: Theoretically, this study revealed the potential pathways through which mindfulness could enable LGB individuals to mitigate self-stigma content and process and thereby alleviate depressive and anxiety symptoms. Practically, this study pointed to the potential utility of mindfulness training in facilitating LGB individuals to resist societal stigma, reduce internalized stigma, and lessen emotional distress.","Chan, Kevin Ka Shing; Leung, Donald Chi Kin",J Affect Disord,350,30

Immunosuppressives and biological treatments multiply the chances of opportunistic and lung infections, especially in combination therapy, so due to the new coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2) epidemic, which primarily causes respiratory disease, it is advisable to use different therapeutic considerations for effective and safe patient care. Contrary to the expectations, a study from Italy and China each, despite of the large number of infected cases, did not report any SARS-CoV-2 positivity in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, which can be due to a number of favorable factors, such as the lower average age of the patients, lack of comorbidities, etc. However, it should not be forgotten that the patients on immunosuppressive and/or biological therapy belong to the compromised group. Consequently, in some cases there is a need to modify the therapy, but we should keep in mind that the relapse alongside with the need of medical consultation and even hospitalization elevate the chance of being infected. Thus, flare-ups ought to be avoided as far as they can be, so continuing the already started maintenance therapy can be a reasonable solution, but, in the high-risk group, modifying it can be reasonable as well.

Yet, little is known about the nationwide capacity for delivering primary care services via telehealth. METHODS: Using the 2016 National Ambulatory Medical Survey we estimated the number and proportion of reported visits and services that could be provided via telehealth. We also performed cross-tabulations to calculate the number and proportion of physicians providing telephone visits and e-mail/internet encounters. RESULTS: Of the total visits (nearly 400 million) to primary care physicians, 42% were amenable to telehealth and 73% of the total services rendered could be delivered through telehealth modalities. Of the primary care physicians, 44% provided telephone consults and 19% provided e-consults. DISCUSSION: This study underscores how and where primary care services could be delivered. It provides the first estimates of the capacity of primary care to provide telehealth services for COVID-19 related illness, and for several other acute and chronic medical conditions. It also highlights the fact that, as of 2016, most outpatient telehealth visits were done via telephone.

March 24, 2020, was considered as a cutoff for analyzing before and during lockdown period dispensing trends. No information regarding individual patients was retrieved in the current study. Results: There was a decrease in total morphine, tramadol, and fentanyl patch dispensing parallel to decrease in total number of patients visiting the outpatient department. However, there was a statistically significant increase in per capita opioid dispensing during the lockdown period. There was also an increase in the proportion of cancer pain patients that were dispensed morphine during the lockdown.

The interactions have been investigated by using molecular docking, quantum chemical and molecular dynamics simulations methods. The molecular structures of all the ligands are studied quantum chemically in terms of their optimized structures, 3-D orbital distributions, global chemical descriptors, molecular electrostatic potential plots and HOMO-LUMO orbital energies. All the ligands show reasonably good binding affinities with nsp-13 protein. The ligand L2 shows to have better binding affinities to Chain A and Chain B of nsp13 protein, which are -6.7 and -6.4 kcal/mol. The study of intermolecular interactions indicates that L2 shows different hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions with both chains. Furthermore, molecular dynamic simulations of the nsp13-L2 complex are obtained over a time scale of 60 ns, which indicates its stability and flexibility behavior as assessed in terms of its RMSD and RMSF graphs.

Finally, NSP8 and NSP9 bind to the 7SL RNA in the signal recognition particle and interfere with protein trafficking to the cell membrane upon infection. Disruption of each of these essential cellular functions acts to suppress the interferon response to viral infection. Our results uncover a multipronged strategy utilized by SARS-CoV-2 to antagonize essential cellular processes to suppress host defenses.","Banerjee, Abhik K; Blanco, Mario R; Bruce, Emily A; Honson, Drew D; Chen, Linlin M; Chow, Amy; Bhat, Prashant; Ollikainen, Noah; Quinodoz, Sofia A; Loney, Colin; Thai, Jasmine; Miller, Zachary D; Lin, Aaron E; Schmidt, Madaline M; Stewart, Douglas G; Goldfarb, Daniel; De Lorenzo, Giuditta; Rihn, Suzannah J; Voorhees, Rebecca M; Botten, Jason W; Majumdar, Devdoot; Guttman, Mitchell",Cell,350,2

In contrast to proteins, where numerous high-resolution crystal structures serve as coordinate templates for this mapping, such models are rarely available for smaller oligonucleotides accessible via NMR, or they exhibit crystal packing and counter-ion binding artifacts that prevent their use for the chemical shifts analysis. On the other hand, NMR-determined structures of RNA often are not solved at the density of restraints required to precisely define the variable degrees of freedom. In this study we sidestep the problems of direct parameterization of the RNA chemical shifts/structure relationship, and examine the effects of imposing local fragmental coordinate similarity restraints based on similarities of the experimental secondary ribose 13C/1H chemical shifts instead. The effect of such chemical shift similarity (CSS) restraints on the structural accuracy is assessed via residual dipolar coupling (RDC)-based cross-validation. Improvements in the coordinate accuracy are observed for all of the six RNA constructs considered here as test cases, which argues for routine inclusion of these terms during NMR-based oligonucleotide structure determination. Such accuracy improvements are expected to facilitate derivation of the chemical shift/structure relationships for RNA.","Lawrence, Chad; Grishaev, Alexander V",RNA,350,16

There is an emergent need to search for possible medications. Cressa cretica is reported to show antitubercular, antibacterial and expectorant property. In this research, we aim to prospect the COVID-19 main protease crystal structure (Mpro; PDB ID: 6LU7) and the active chemical constituents from Cressa cretica in order to understand the structural basis of their interactions. We examined the binding potential of active constituents of Cressa cretica plant to immensely conserved protein Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 followed by exploration of the vast conformational space of protein-ligand complexes by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The results suggest the effectiveness of 3,5-Dicaffeoylquinic acid and Quercetin against standard drug Remdesivir. The active chemical constituents exhibited good docking scores, and interacts with binding site residues of Mpro by forming hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions. 3,5-Dicaffeoylquinic acid showed the best affinity towards Mpro receptor which is one of the target enzymes required by SARS CoV-2 virus for replication suggesting it to be a novel research molecule. The potential of the active chemical constituents from Cressa cretica against the SARS-CoV-2 virus has best been highlighted through this study. Therefore, these chemical entities can be further scrutinized and provides direction for further consideration for in-vivo and in-vitro validations for the treatment of covid-19.","Shah, Sapan; Chaple, Dinesh; Arora, Sumit; Yende, Subhash; Mehta, Chetan; Nayak, Usha",J Biomol Struct Dyn,350,16

In the cerebellum, glutamate spillover from climbing fibers recruits molecular layer interneurons in the absence of conventional synaptic connections. Spillover-mediated signaling is typically limited by transporters that bind and reuptake glutamate. Here, we show that patterned expression of the excitatory amino acid transporter 4 (EAAT4) in Purkinje cells regulates glutamate spillover to molecular layer interneurons. Using male and female Aldolase C-Venus knock-in mice to visualize Zebrin microzones, we find larger climbing fiber-evoked spillover EPSCs in regions with low levels of EAAT4 compared to regions with high EAAT4. This difference is not explained by presynaptic glutamate release properties or postsynaptic receptor density but rather by differences in the glutamate concentration reaching receptors on interneurons. Inhibiting glutamate transport normalizes the differences between microzones, suggesting that heterogeneity in EAAT4 expression is a primary determinant of differential spillover. These results show that neuronal glutamate transporters limit extrasynaptic transmission in a non-cell autonomous manner and provide new insight into the functional specialization of cerebellar microzones.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTExcitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) help maintain the fidelity and independence of point-to-point synaptic transmission. Whereas glial transporters are critical to maintain low ambient levels of extracellular glutamate to prevent excitotoxicity, neuronal transporters have more subtle roles in shaping excitatory synaptic transmission. Here we show that the patterned expression of neuronal EAAT4 in cerebellar microzones controls glutamate spillover from cerebellar climbing fibers to nearby interneurons. These results contribute to fundamental understanding of neuronal transporter functions and specialization of cerebellar microzones.","Malhotra, Shreya; Banumurthy, Gokulakrishna; Pennock, Reagan; Vaden, Jada H; Sugihara, Izumi; Overstreet-Wadiche, Linda; Wadiche, Jacques I",J. neurosci,350,16

Currently, there is no satisfactory treatment of anosmia. Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate the therapeutic effect of nasal betamethasone drops in the recovery of olfaction in COVID-19-associated anosmia. METHODS: The study was designed as a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. In total, 276 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients who were presented to the outpatient clinic with anosmia were enrolled in the study. In the betamethasone group, 138 participants received nasal drops of betamethasone 3 times daily until recovery for a maximum of one month. Similar dose of 9% NaCl drops was administered to 138 participants in the placebo group. RESULTS: The median age of participants was 29 years (IQR 23–37). Among them, 198 (71.7%) were females. Ageusia was co-presented with anosmia in 234 (84.8%) of participants. In this study, 83% of participants had recovered from anosmia within 30 days, with a median recovery time of 13 days (IQR 8–18). Compared to placebo, nasal application of betamethasone drops has no significant effect on the recovery time of anosmia (hazard ratio 0.88; 95% CI 0.68–1.14; P = 0.31). CONCLUSION: The use of nasal betamethasone to facilitate the recovery time of acute anosmia is not advised. In addition, age, smoking status, the duration of anosmia at presentation, and the co-presentation of ageusia with anosmia are important determinant covariates for the recovery time of anosmia. Further clinical trials, which take these covariates into account, will need to be undertaken.

Analyses of the first model suggests that the disease can be eliminated if everybody practices full social-distancing, but the most likely outcome is some level of disease coupled with some level of social-distancing. The same outcome is observed with the second model when the economy is weaker than the social norms to follow health directives. However, if the economy is stronger, it can support some level of social-distancing that can lead to disease elimination.","Martcheva, Maia; Tuncer, Necibe; Ngonghala, Calistus N",J Biol Dyn,350,3

With implementation of lockdown and measures like quarantine, the mental health of people is affected, and the associated problems may range from depression to suicidal ideation. With this background, the aim of this study was to assess COVID-19 anxiety among general population of the state of Andhra Pradesh. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study assessed the COVID-19 anxiety among the population of Andhra Pradesh using COVID-19 Anxiety Scale (CAS-7), a seven-item validated psychometric instrument which assesses the cognitive, emotional, and physiological dimensions of COVID-19 anxiety, using a semantic differential scale. The final sample constituted 1,346 participants. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS version 20 software (IBM SPSS statistics for Windows version 20, Armonk, NY, USA). RESULTS: The mean age of the study participants was 36.13 ± 10.2 years, and 55.8% were males. The mean CAS-7 score in this study was found to be 18.9 ± 6.4. The item with highest mean scores was: “How concerned are you when people cough or sneeze because of the fear that you may acquire COVID-19?” No significant differences in CAS-7 scores were found based on gender, educational qualification of the participants, while significant differences were observed based on place of residence, presence of COVID-19 affected individuals in close surroundings, tobacco, and alcohol consumption.

The methodology adopted was based on literature review, interviews with officials and actors in the field, and remote discussion workshops with a multidisciplinary and multisectoral working group. Morocco took advantage of the capacities already strengthened within the framework of the application of the provisions of the International Health Regulations (IHR) of 2005. A SWOT analysis made it possible to note that an unprecedented political commitment enabled all the necessary means to face the pandemic and carry out all the response activities, including a campaign of relentless communication. Nevertheless, and despite the efforts made, the shortage of human resources, especially those qualified in intensive care and resuscitation, has been the main drawback to be addressed. The main lesson learned is a need to further strengthen national capacities to prepare for and respond to possible public health emergencies and to embark on a process overhaul of the health system, including research into innovative tools to ensure the continuity of the various disease prevention and control activities. In addition, response to a health crisis is not only the responsibility of the health sector but also intersectoral collaboration is needed to guarantee an optimal coordinated fight.

However, the subgroup analyses indicated significant association between ACEIs/ARBs and hospitalization among USA studies (OR:1.59; 95%CI:1.03,2.44), peer‐reviewed (OR:1.93, 95%CI:1.38,2.71), good quality and studies which reported adjusted measure of effect (OR:1.30, 95%CI:1.10,1.50). Significant differences were found between ACEIs and ARBs with the latter being significantly associated with lower risk of acquiring COVID‐19 infection (OR:0.24; 95%CI: 0.17,0.34). In conclusion, high‐quality evidence exists for the effect of ACEIs/ARBs on some COVID‐19 clinical outcomes. For the first time, we provided evidence, albeit of low quality, on interclass differences between ACEIs and ARBs for some of the reported clinical outcomes.","Kurdi, Amanj; Abutheraa, Nouf; Akil, Lina; Godman, Brian",Pharmacol Res Perspect,350,22

For this reason, annual vaccination against influenza is generally recommended for all healthcare workers, thereby embracing the twin principles of beneficence and non-maleficence. The cost and burden of influenza vaccination is minimal, and it has been argued that employing institutions are under an obligation to ensure that employees are universally vaccinated. Presenteeism, i.e. reporting for work when unwell, is another significant cause of nosocomial infection and may easily occur as even in the hypothetical ideal situation of 100% vaccination coverage, the influenza vaccine is not 100% effective. This paper reviews the combined benefits of increased vaccination rates and reduced presenteeism rates in healthcare workers, particularly in the event of a winter surge in COVID-19 infections that will result in simultaneous infection with influenza and COVID-19, with potentially severe consequences.","Grech, Victor; Borg, Michael; Gauci, Charmaine; Barbara, Christopher; Montalto, Simon Attard; Agius, Steve; Falzon, Celia",Early Hum Dev,350,1

Many state-of-the-art tools have limited capacity, as they can extract gene–disease associations only from single sentences or abstract texts. A few studies have explored extracting gene–disease associations from full-text articles, but there exists a large room for improvements. In this work, we propose RENET2, a deep learning-based RE method, which implements Section Filtering and ambiguous relations modeling to extract gene–disease associations from full-text articles. We designed a novel iterative training data expansion strategy to build an annotated full-text dataset to resolve the scarcity of labels on full-text articles. In our experiments, RENET2 achieved an F1-score of 72.13% for extracting gene–disease associations from an annotated full-text dataset, which was 27.22, 30.30, 29.24 and 23.87% higher than BeFree, DTMiner, BioBERT and RENET, respectively. We applied RENET2 to (i) ∼1.89M full-text articles from PubMed Central and found ∼3.72M gene–disease associations; and (ii) the LitCovid articles and ranked the top 15 proteins associated with COVID-19, supported by recent articles. RENET2 is an efficient and accurate method for full-text gene–disease association extraction. The source-code, manually curated abstract/full-text training data, and results of RENET2 are available at GitHub.","Su, Junhao; Wu, Ye; Ting, Hing-Fung; Lam, Tak-Wah; Luo, Ruibang",NAR Genom Bioinform,350,26

This study uses daily data over the past two decades to determine the minimum variance hedge ratio for airlines wishing to hedge jet fuel price risk with futures, while also establishing the best cross hedging asset. Airlines hedging with futures would create the most effective hedge by using heating oil futures contracts with a 3-month maturity. We also find that beyond the 3-month veil, increased time to maturity makes heating oil less effective as a cross hedge proxy for jet fuel. However, both in-sample analysis and Monte Carlo simulation results with daily data show that none of the 4 cross hedge proxies, including heating oil, can be considered highly effective.","Turner, Peter A.; Lim, Siew Hoon",Journal of Air Transport Management,350,26

Although complete vaccination consisted of 2 doses, the onset of protection for both licensed RNA vaccines was observed as early as 12 days after a single dose. The adaptive immune response that coincides with this onset of protection could represent the necessary elements of immunity against COVID-19. METHODS: Serological and T cell analysis was performed in a cohort of 20 healthcare workers after receiving the first dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine. The primary endpoint was the adaptive immune responses detectable at days 7 and 10 after dosing. FINDINGS: Spike-specific T cells and binding antibodies were detectable 10 days after the first dose of the vaccine, in contrast to receptor-blocking and severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) neutralizing antibodies, which were mostly undetectable at this early time point. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that early T cell and binding antibody responses, rather than either receptor-blocking or virus neutralizing activity, induced early protection against COVID-19.

However, whether viral load in the throat during admission is different between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients is not well known. By conducting a prospective cohort study of patients with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19, cycle threshold (Ct) values of the polymerase chain reaction test for COVID-19 were examined every other day during admission. The Ct values during admission increased more steadily in symptomatic patients and febrile patients than in asymptomatic patients, with significance (p = 0.01 and p = 0.004, respectively), although the Ct values as a whole were not significantly different between the two groups. Moreover, the Ct values as a whole were higher in patients with dysosmia/dysgeusia than in those without it (p = 0.02), whereas they were lower in patients with a headache than those without (p = 0.01).

Recent studies reported on positive outcomes of intensive physiotherapy of upper extremities. We built a telerehabilitation system with virtual pick and place tasks for small scale hand movements, and designed a pilot study to find whether such exergaming as a telerehabilitation service provides comparable outcomes as an outpatient exergaming service. A non-randomized pilot trial was designed. Hospital outpatients (28/40) with Parkinson's disease were recruited. Those meeting the inclusion criteria were divided into two groups; seven outpatients were assigned to the home (H) group and 21 outpatients to the hospital (URI) group. Both groups received 10 days of exergaming over the course of 2 weeks, each daily session lasting a maximum of 1 h. Primary outcomes were clinical tests; Box and Blocks Test (BBT), Jebsen Hand Function Test (JHFT), and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS part III) were carried out before and after the study. Secondary outcomes were hand kinematics and exergaming results; number of successfully moved objects and task time. Statistical analysis was carried out to find significant (p < 0.05) differences and Cohen's U3 was used to determine effect sizes. The differences between the groups in gender (p = 0.781), age (p = 0.192), and duration of the disease (p = 0.195) were tested with Bartlett's test and no statistical differences were found with an F test. Both groups demonstrated statistically significant improvements in clinical test UDPRS III (p = 0.006 and p = 0.011) and the hospital group also in BBT (p = 0.002) and JHFT (p = 0.015) and with UDPRS III and JHFT even in favor of the home group (χ(2) = 5.08, p = 0.024, χ(2) = 7.76, p = 0.005). Nevertheless, the exergaming results show significant improvement after training (U3 > 0.86).

In this study, we have hypothesized that suitable air ventilation in historic buildings may enhance the built environment to combat the spreading of infectious viruses. To provide such quantitative shreds of evidence, we have generated and estimated an integrated model to summarize obtained information by considering natural ventilation, wind speed, inflow and outflow, wind direction, and forecasting the associated risks of airborne disease transmission in a historical building (i.e., the Hazzazi House in particular). Intrinsically, the results have demonstrated that the effectiveness of natural ventilation has directly influenced reducing the risks of transmitting airborne infectious viruses for the selected heritage building in Jeddah (Saudi Arabia). The adopted methods in this research may be useful to understand the potentials of conserving old heritage buildings. Consequently, the results demonstrate that natural air ventilation systems are critical to combat the spread of infectious diseases in the pandemic.","Alaidroos, Alaa; Almaimani, Ayad; Baik, Ahmed; Al-Amodi, Mohamed; Rahaman, Khan Rubayet",Int J Environ Res Public Health,350,5

Results suggest that a control strategy that involves maximizing and {varepsilon} is likely to be successful, although quarantine is still more effective in limiting the spread of the virus. Release from quarantine depends on continuance and strict adherence to recommended social and health-promoting behaviors.

Artificial intelligence-based diagnostic decision support system have been developed to enhance clinical performance by suggesting differential diagnoses to a given case, based on an integrated medical knowledge base and machine learning techniques. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of Ada, an app-based diagnostic tool and the impact on patient outcome. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The eRadaR trial is a prospective, double-blinded study with patients presenting to the emergency room (ER) with abdominal pain. At initial contact in the ER, a structured interview will be performed using the Ada-App and both, patients and attending physicians, will be blinded to the proposed diagnosis lists until trial completion. Throughout the study, clinical data relating to diagnostic findings and types of therapy will be obtained and the follow-up until day 90 will comprise occurrence of complications and overall survival of patients. The primary efficacy of the trial is defined by the percentage of correct diagnoses suggested by Ada compared with the final discharge diagnosis.

We argue that there is no ethically relevant difference between withdrawing and withholding treatment and that suggesting otherwise may have problematic consequences. If doctors are discouraged from withdrawing treatment, concern about a future shortage may make them reluctant to provide ventilation to patients who are unlikely to have a successful outcome.

Results Twenty-six studies were included with 1228 pooled subjects, with a mean age of 8.6 years, which were dominated by male gender (53%), and African ethnicity (31%). 732 (38%) patients were reactive on a serological test, and 457 patients (45%) were positive on SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. ST-segment abnormalities were the most common ECG findings (16%, n/N: 34/212). Various markers of troponin and the pooled mean of BNP and NT-pro-BNP levels were elevated. Cardiomegaly and pericardial effusion (21.8%, n/N: 164/751) was the most common chest X-ray findings. In echocardiography, the majority of patients’ left ventricular ejection fraction was reduced (59.0%, n/N: 180/305), with pericardial effusion/ pericarditis seen the most (17.44%, n/N: 221/1267), and Z score ≥ 2 in 28% (n/N: 42/139). Cardiac MRI findings were consistent with acute myocarditis. Intravenous immunoglobulin, corticosteroids, and vasoactive drugs were frequently utilized. The mean length of stay was 6 days, with most patients (71%, n/N: 834/1163) were admitted to the ICU. However, the overall prognosis was favourable, with 98% alive (n/N: 1235/1260), and more than 50% of patients experienced recovery of left ventricular systolic functions at discharge (116 out of 206 patients). Conclusion PIMS-TS is a rare clinical syndrome associated with a multiorgan system dysfunction, especially acute cardiac injury, and mandates a higher level of care. Nevertheless, when appropriate treatments are available, the cardiac function rapidly reverted to normal in most cases, and it was associated with a favourable outcome in general.

In synovial fluid, CD4(+), CD8(+), and γδ T cells expressed Th1-related markers, whereas Th17 cells were not enriched. Th1 skewing was prominent in CD4(+) T cells, including Tregs, and was associated with severe disease. Transcriptomic studies confirmed a Th1 signature in CD4(+) T cells from synovial fluid.

Although synovial fluid CD4(+) T cells displayed an overall Th1 phenotype, scRNA-Seq uncovered heterogeneous effector and regulatory subpopulations, including IFN-induced Tregs, peripheral helper T cells, and cytotoxic CD4(+) T cells. In conclusion, oligo JIA is characterized by Th1 polarization that encompasses Tregs but does not compromise their regulatory identity. Targeting Th1-driven inflammation and augmenting Treg function may represent important therapeutic approaches in oligo JIA.","Julé, Amélie M.; Hoyt, Kacie J.; Wei, Kevin; Gutierrez-Arcelus, Maria; Taylor, Maria L.; Ng, Julie; Lederer, James A.; Case, Siobhan M.; Chang, Margaret H.; Cohen, Ezra M.; Dedeoglu, Fatma; Hazen, Melissa M.; Hausmann, Jonathan S.; Halyabar, Olha; Janssen, Erin; Lo, Jeffrey; Lo, Mindy S.; Meidan, Esra; Roberts, Jordan E.; Son, Mary Beth F.; Sundel, Robert P.; Lee, Pui Y.; Chatila, Talal; Nigrovic, Peter A.; Henderson, Lauren A.",JCI insight,350,12

In many cases, malnutrition is associated with diarrhoea and intestinal inflammation, further contributing to morbidity and death(2). The mechanisms by which unbalanced dietary nutrients affect intestinal homeostasis are largely unknown. Here we report that deficiency in murine angiotensin I converting enzyme (peptidyl-dipeptidase A) 2 (Ace2), which encodes a key regulatory enzyme of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), results in highly increased susceptibility to intestinal inflammation induced by epithelial damage. The RAS is known to be involved in acute lung failure(3), cardiovascular functions(4) and SARS infections(5). Mechanistically, ACE2 has a RAS-independent function, regulating intestinal amino acid homeostasis, expression of antimicrobial peptides, and the ecology of the gut microbiome. Transplantation of the altered microbiota from Ace2 mutant mice into germ-free wild-type hosts was able to transmit the increased propensity to develop severe colitis. ACE2-dependent changes in epithelial immunity and the gut microbiota can be directly regulated by the dietary amino acid tryptophan. Our results identify ACE2 as a key regulator of dietary amino acid homeostasis, innate immunity, gut microbial ecology, and transmissible susceptibility to colitis. These results provide a molecular explanation for how amino acid malnutrition can cause intestinal inflammation and diarrhoea.

Our objective was to survey rhinologists and understand the extent to which telemedicine serves as a rejoinder to in-person consultation: appreciation of relevant factors may be important in planning for present and future considerations. METHODS: A 14-question anonymous survey sent out to the American Rhinologic Society (ARS) membership in April 2020. It included demographic factors and detailed questions examining the extent of telemedicine use. Numerous topics including the degree of use, satisfaction with services, and utility of services were evaluated. RESULTS: There were 134 respondents. Most reported seeing ≤30% of typical in-person volume, with 14.8% not seeing any patients at all. 88.1% used telemedicine; 82.0% reported some level of satisfaction with telemedicine. The vast majority utilized platforms employing audio and video (83.3%), and a plurality reported spending 5–15 min on calls. Numerous reasons were cited for the use of telemedicine, including significant public health benefits amid the crisis (89.7%). Only 12.0% of respondents reported using telemedicine for hospital consultation. CONCLUSION: Rhinologists have embraced telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic in an attempt to improve accessibility, patient satisfaction, and revenue stream. When utilized appropriately, this technology obviates the need for seeing at-risk patients and performing procedures such as nasal endoscopy. Only a minority of rhinologists was dissatisfied, viewing this as a temporary fix during the pandemic.","Svider, Peter; Setzen, Michael; Ow, Randall; Folbe, Adam J.; Eloy, Jean Anderson; Johnson, Andrew P.",Am J Otolaryngol,350,20

Lactoferrin (LF) is a naturally occurring non-toxic glycoprotein with broad-spectrum antiviral, immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects. In this study, we assessed the potential of LF in the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. Antiviral immune response gene expression was analyzed by qRT-PCR in uninfected Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells treated with LF. An infection assay for SARS-CoV-2 was performed in Caco-2 cells treated or not with LF. SARS-CoV-2 titer was determined by qRT-PCR, plaque assay and immunostaining. Inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine production was determined by qRT-PCR. LF significantly induced the expression of IFNA1, IFNB1, TLR3, TLR7, IRF3, IRF7 and MAVS genes. Furthermore, LF partially inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication in Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells. Our in vitro data support LF as an immune modulator of the antiviral immune response with moderate effects against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Salaris, Claudio; Scarpa, Melania; Elli, Marina; Bertolini, Alice; Guglielmetti, Simone; Pregliasco, Fabrizio; Blandizzi, Corrado; Brun, Paola; Castagliuolo, Ignazio",Nutrients,350,1

METHODS: To improve the forecast accuracy and investigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2, we constructed four mathematical models to numerically estimate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the efficacy of eradication strategies. RESULTS: Using the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) model, and including measures such as city closures and extended leave policies implemented by the Chinese government that effectively reduced the β value, we estimated that the β value and basic transmission number, R(0), of SARS-CoV-2 was 0.476/6.66 in Wuhan, 0.359/5.03 in Korea, and 0.400/5.60 in Italy. Considering medicine and vaccines, an advanced model demonstrated that the emergence of vaccines would greatly slow the spread of the virus. Our model predicted that 100,000 people would become infected assuming that the isolation rate α in Wuhan was 0.30. If quarantine measures were taken from March 10, 2020, and the quarantine rate of α was also 0.3, then the final number of infected people was predicted to be 11,426 in South Korea and 147,142 in Italy. CONCLUSIONS: Our mathematical models indicate that SARS-CoV-2 eradication depends on systematic planning, effective hospital isolation, and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, and some measures including city closures and leave policies should be implemented to ensure SARS-CoV-2 eradication.","Jiang, Shuo; Li, Qiuyue; Li, Chaoqun; Liu, Shanshan; He, Xiaomeng; Wang, Tao; Li, Hua; Corpe, Christopher; Zhang, Xiaoyan; Xu, Jianqing; Wang, Jin",J Transl Med,350,16

A Nationwide Population-Based Cohort Study,16.720787,11.118038,2021-06-10,"Background The COVID-19 serological tests for IgG and IgM have been developed with several methodologies: Immunoenzymatic Assay (ELISA), Chemiluminescence, Electro Chemiluminescence, Fluorescent Lateral Flow Immunoassays and Immunochromatography. None of these tests should be used for the diagnosis or population screening of the disease, considering that the antibodies appear only on the 8th - 14th day of the disease onset. The present study evaluates a sample of immunofluorescent and immunochromatographic rapid tests to show their agreement in relation to Chemiluminescence. Methods A diagnostic test evaluation assay was performed to establish the performance of five rapid tests (4 immunochromatographic and 1 immunofluorescent tests) for IgG and IgM serology for SARS-CoV-2 using a panel of 30 serum samples from patients received in the laboratory analysis routine. For the evaluation of clinical performance, the qualitative results of the rapid tests were compared against those obtained by chemiluminescence, dichotomized as positives (>>10 AU / mL) or negative (<10 UA / mL). Findings The best agreement is seen in the immunofluorescent assay, for the IgG contrast, with a particularly good kappa index (0.85), without positive disagreements and a negative disagreement of about 15%. In the immunochromatographic methods Kappa index was 0.61 at best, with disagreements in negative findings of {approx}35% and in positive cases of up to {approx}70%. The IgM concordance behavior, on the other hand, reflects a weak to moderate Kappa concordance value (Kappa 0.2 to 0.6), with negative disagreements reaching up to 55% and positives of up to 84%, without any evaluated test reaching Kappa performance equal to or greater than 0.8. Interpretation Serological studies should be used in the clinical and epidemiological context and of other diagnostic tests. Given the high demand and supply in the market of ""rapid serological tests"", its evaluation against panels of serologically positive or negative samples established by Chemiluminescence or Electro chemiluminescence is essential to authorize its extensive use in populations Funding None","Saenz-Flor, K.

We hypothesized that males and females in different age groups might have different epidemic trajectories. METHODS: Using publicly available data from South Korea, daily new COVID-19 cases were fitted with generalized additive models, assuming Poisson and negative binomial distributions. Epidemic dynamics by age and gender groups were explored with interactions between smoothed time terms and age and gender. RESULTS: A negative binomial distribution fitted the daily case counts best. Interaction between the dynamic patterns of daily new cases and age groups was statistically significant (p < 0.001), but not with gender group. People aged 20-39 years led the epidemic processes in the society with two peaks: one major peak around March 1 and a smaller peak around April 7, 2020. The epidemic process among people aged 60 or above was trailing behind that of younger people with smaller magnitude. After March 15, there was a consistent decline of daily new cases among elderly people, despite large fluctuations of case counts among young adults. CONCLUSIONS: Although young people drove the COVID-19 epidemic in the whole society with multiple rebounds, elderly people could still be protected from virus infection after the peak of epidemic.","Yu, Xinhua; Duan, Jiasong; Jiang, Yu; Zhang, Hongmei",Int J Infect Dis,350,21

However, vaccine hesitancy can undermine its diffusion with severe consequences on global health. While beliefs in conspiracy theories, mistrust in science and in policymakers, and mistrust in official information channels may also increment vaccine hesitancy, understanding their psychological causes could improve our capacity to respond to the pandemic. Thus, we designed a cross-sectional study with the aim of probing vaccine propensity in the Italian population and explored its relationship with sociodemographic and psychological variables, and with misbeliefs in COVID-19. A battery of questionnaires was administered to a sample of 374 Italian adults during the first national lockdown (April 2020). The materials included an original instrument—Beliefs in COVID-19 Inventory—and questionnaires measuring perceived stress, anxiety, death anxiety, psychological distress, psychoticism, paranoia, anger, and somatization. The exploratory factor analysis (EFA) on Beliefs in COVID-19 suggested the existence of three factors: belief in conspiracy theories, mistrust in medical information, and mistrust in medicine and science. These factors were positively correlated with female sex, age, religious beliefs, psychiatric conditions, and psychological variables, while negatively correlated with education levels. We conducted a mediation analysis by means of a structural equation model, including psychological factors as predictors, beliefs in COVID-19 scales as mediators, and vaccine propensity as an outcome. The model showed that death anxiety had a direct positive effect on the propensity to get vaccinated. It also showed that death anxiety reduced the propensity to get vaccinated through a mediated path in believing in conspiracy theories, whereas paranoia was linked to a reduction in vaccination adherence with the mediation effect of mistrust in medical science. Psychological distress reduced vaccination propensity by increasing both conspiracy beliefs and mistrust. On the other hand, anxiety increased the propensity to get vaccinated through a decrease in both belief in conspiracy theories and mistrust in science. Our results suggest that psychological dimensions are differentially related to belief in conspiracy theories, to mistrust in science, and to the propensity to get vaccinated. Based on this result, we propose an original interpretation of how conspiracy beliefs build on a paranoid and suspicious attitude. We also discuss the possible clinical implications of treatment for such pathological beliefs.","Simione, Luca; Vagni, Monia; Gnagnarella, Camilla; Bersani, Giuseppe; Pajardi, Daniela",Front Psychol,350,1

Human Flesh Searching (HFS) is a form of collective online behavior where netizens contribute information to social media and/or networking platforms about a certain event or a target individual or group to achieve what they regard as justice. It has been used to identify and investigate crime. Some netizens go further and take justice into their own hands by punishing alleged criminals and deviants through online shaming. Using the results of a survey conducted in Hong Kong, the research found both gender and time spent online are not significant variables to predict netizens’ intention to contribute to HFS. A positive attitude toward HFS was the strongest predictor of HFS intention. Vigilantism was also a strong predictor of HFS intention. Vigilantism not only affects HFS intention directly, but also indirectly through a positive attitude on HFS. Fairness might negatively influence people’s HFS intention and attitude toward HFS; however, this influence was found to be weak in the present study. Social Justice might not affect HFS intention directly, yet it might exert its effect via a positive attitude toward HFS. That is, netizens who intend to contribute to HFS are those who have less confidence in the criminal justice system and believe highly that people should take justice into their own hands.","Chang, Lennon Y.

Our objective was to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of HRV positivity in a heterogeneous population of hospitalized children, compared to those positive for another respiratory virus and those where no respiratory virus was detected. METHODS: A retrospective case–control study of children hospitalized between January 2014 to April 2015 who had a respiratory viral specimen collected. Clinical and laboratory data were collected, and baseline characteristics and clinical variables were compared. RESULTS: During the study period, there were 671 specimens obtained from 577 patients that were processed for the respiratory viral polymerase chain reaction assay, of which 198 were positive for HRV, 167 positive for another respiratory virus, and 306 where no respiratory virus was detected. A history of asthma was significantly associated with HRV-positive patients (odds ratio [OR] 3.71; P < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, HRV-positive patients had a higher requirement for mechanical ventilation (OR 1.44), lower rates of readmission (OR 0.53), and lower mortality (OR 0.35) compared to patients with no respiratory virus isolated; however, none were statistically significant. HRV-positive patients did have a significantly shorter length of stay (LOS) compared with patients with no respiratory virus isolated (difference–0.35; P = 0.001). Similar outcomes were seen in patients positive for other respiratory viruses. CONCLUSIONS: HRV-positive hospitalized pediatric patients with a heterogeneous set of clinical diagnoses had higher association with asthma compared to patients who had another, or no, respiratory virus isolated. HRV-positive patients had shorter LOS compared to patients who had no respiratory viruses isolated. These findings suggest that HRV positivity in hospitalized pediatric patients may not lead to adverse clinical outcomes, although asthma is a risk factor regardless of clinical comorbidities and diagnoses.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting incidence, mortality and risk factors for AKI in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We systematically searched 11 electronic databases until 29 May 2020 for studies in English reporting original data on AKI and kidney replacement therapy (KRT) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Incidences of AKI and KRT and risk ratios for mortality associated with AKI were pooled using generalized linear mixed and random-effects models. Potential risk factors for AKI were assessed using meta-regression. Incidences were stratified by geographic location and disease severity. RESULTS: A total of 3042 articles were identified, of which 142 studies were included, with 49 048 hospitalized COVID-19 patients including 5152 AKI events. The risk of bias of included studies was generally low. The pooled incidence of AKI was 28.6% [95% confidence interval (CI) 19.8–39.5] among hospitalized COVID-19 patients from the USA and Europe (20 studies) and 5.5% (95% CI 4.1–7.4) among patients from China (62 studies), whereas the pooled incidence of KRT was 7.7% (95% CI 5.1–11.4; 18 studies) and 2.2% (95% CI 1.5–3.3; 52 studies), respectively. Among patients admitted to the intensive care unit, the incidence of KRT was 20.6% (95% CI 15.7–26.7; 38 studies).

The number of new cases is 457 in 2015. Riyadh has the highest number of reports in comparison to the other cities. According to this report, males are more susceptible than female, especially after the age of 40. Because of the awareness and early diagnosis the incidence is falling gradually. The pre-existence of another disease like cancer or diabetic etc. boosts the infection. MERS is a zoonotic disease and human to human transmission is low. The MERS-CoV is a RNA virus with protein envelope. On the outer surface, virus has spike like glycoprotein which is responsible for the attachment and entrance inside host cells. There is no specific treatment for the MERS-CoV till now, but drugs are in pipeline which bind with the spike glycoprotein and inhibit its entrance host cells. MERS-CoV and SAR-CoV are from the same genus, so it was thought that the drugs which inhibit the growth of SARS-CoV can also inhibit the growth of MERS-CoV but those drugs are not completely inhibiting virus activity. Until we don’t have proper structure and the treatment of MERS-CoV, We should take precautions, especially the health care workers, Camel owners and Pilgrims during Hajj and Umrah, because they are at a higher risk of getting infected.","Faridi, Uzma",Saudi J Biol Sci,350,33

The COVID-19 pandemic has affected various public health functions and essential services in different ways and magnitudes. Although all countries have witnessed the effect of COVID-19, the impact differed based on many factors including the integrity and resiliency of the countries’ health systems. This paper presents opinions and expectations of the authors about the anticipated changes in the future of public health at the global, regional, and national levels. The viewpoint is based on the current efforts and challenges that various stakeholders have carried out to control COVID-19 and the contribution from the literature on the future of public health. Numerous agencies and actors are involved in the fight against COVID-19 with variations in their effectiveness. The public health services showed weaknesses in most of the countries, in addition to the lack of adequate curative medicine settings. The pandemic highlighted the need for better governance and stronger and more resilient health systems and capacities. The COVID-19 experience has also emphasized the importance of coordination and collaboration among the countries and stakeholders. The COVID-19 pandemic might lead to a wide discussion to improve international and national approaches to prepare for and respond to similar events in terms of preparedness and response mechanisms and tools. Public health will not be the same as before COVID-19. New health priorities, approaches, and new agendas will be on the table of the global platforms and initiatives. More investment in research and technology to meet the demand for new vaccines and medicines, innovative methods like distance learning and working, more respect and remuneration to health professionals, and normalization of the public health and social measures that were induced during the COVID-19 pandemic are expected to be seen in future.","Bashier, Haitham; Ikram, Aamer; Khan, Mumtaz Ali; Baig, Mirza; Al Gunaid, Magid; Al Nsour, Mohannad; Khader, Yousef",JMIR Public Health Surveill,350,0

A discrete choice experiment (DCE) with decision-makers and people involved in the preparation of evidence syntheses was undertaken to elicit preferences for methodological shortcuts in the conduct of abbreviated reviews. METHODS: D-efficient scenarios, each containing 14 pairwise comparisons, were designed for the DCE: the development of an evidence synthesis in 20 working days (scenario 1) and 12 months (scenario 2), respectively. Six attributes (number of databases, number of reviewers during screening, publication period, number of reviewers during data extraction, full-text analysis, types of HTA domains) with 2 to 3 levels each were defined. These were presented to the target population in an online survey. The relative importance of the individual attributes was determined using logistic regression models. RESULTS: Scenario 1 was completed by 36 participants and scenario 2 by 26 participants. The linearity assumption was confirmed by the full model. In both scenarios, the linear difference model showed a preference for higher levels for “number of reviewers during data extraction”, followed by “number of reviewers during screening” and “full-text analysis”. Subgroup analyses showed that preferences were influenced by participation in the preparation of evidence syntheses.

METHODS: A multi-disciplinary team developed a screening score taking into account epidemiology history, clinical feature, radiographic feature, and routine blood test. At fever clinics, the screening score was used to identify the patients with moderate to high probability of COVID-19 among all the suspected patients. The patients with moderate to high probability of COVID-19 were allocated to a single room in an isolation ward with level-3 protection. And those with low probability were allocated to a single room in a general ward with level-2 protection. At the isolation ward, the screening score was used to identify the confirmed and probable cases after two consecutive real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests. The data in the People’s Hospital of Changshou District were used for internal validation and those in the People’s Hospital of Yubei District for external validation. RESULTS: We enrolled 76 and 40 patients for internal and external validation, respectively. In the internal validation cohort, the area under the curve of receiver operating characteristics (AUC) was 0.96 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.89–0.99] for the diagnosis of moderate to high probability of cases among all the suspected patients. Using 60 as cut-off value, the sensitivity and specificity were 88% and 93%, respectively. In the isolation ward, the AUC was 0.94 (95% CI: 0.83–0.99) for the diagnosis of confirmed and probable cases. Using 90 as cut-off value, the sensitivity and specificity were 78% and 100%, respectively. These results were confirmed in the validation cohort. CONCLUSION: The scoring system provides a reference on COVID-19 triage in fever clinics to reduce misdiagnosis and consumption of protective supplies.

Some of the methods used to destroy pigs on the farms severely compromised animal welfare. Reliance on a few large slaughter plants created a fragile supply chain. Animal welfare auditing conducted by large meat buyers was also hindered by COVID-19. Many live in-person audits were stopped and replaced by a combination of stationary video cameras and live streamed videos from mobile phones. To insure high standards of animal welfare, video methods should never completely replace in-person visits. ABSTRACT: In the U.S., the most severe animal welfare problems caused by COViD-19 were in the pork industry. Thousands of pigs had to be destroyed on the farm due to reduced slaughter capacity caused by ill workers. In the future, both short-term and long-term remedies will be needed. In the short-term, a portable electrocution unit that uses scientifically validated electrical parameters for inducing instantaneous unconsciousness, would be preferable to some of the poor killing methods. A second alternative would be converting the slaughter houses to carcass production. This would require fewer people to process the same number of pigs. The pandemic revealed the fragility of large centralized supply chains. A more distributed supply chain with smaller abattoirs would be more robust and less prone to disruption, but the cost of pork would be greater. Small abattoirs can coexist with large slaughter facilities if they process pigs for specialized premium markets such as high welfare pork. The pandemic also had a detrimental effect on animal welfare inspection and third party auditing programs run by large meat buyers. Most in-person audits in the slaughter plants were cancelled and audits were done by video. Video audits should never completely replace in-person audits.","Grandin, Temple",Animals (Basel),350,33

We studied 78 individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-19, who received a single dose of BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, and 1:2 ratio matched infection-naïve cohort who received two injections. The evaluation procedure included symptom monitoring, and serological tests. Among the post-infected population, the median IgG-S response after the first vaccine dose was 3.35 AU, compared to 2.38 AU after the second vaccine injection in the infection naive group. A strong correlation was demonstrated between IgG-S level before vaccination, and the corresponding responses after a single vaccine dose (r = 0.8, p < 0.001) in the post infected population. Short-term severe symptoms that required medical attention were found in 6.8% among the post-infected individuals, while none were found in the infection naïve population. Our data suggest that a single vaccine dose is sufficient to induce an intense immune response in post-infected population regardless of seropositivity. Although some short-term safety issues were observed compared to the infection naïve population, a single dose regimen can be considered safe in post-infected populations.","Efrati, Shai; Catalogna, Merav; Abu Hamad, Ramzia; Hadanny, Amir; Bar-Chaim, Adina; Benveniste-Levkovitz, Patricia; Levtzion-korach, Osnat",Sci Rep,350,26

The integration of antimicrobial and hydrophobic catheter materials, and pressure-activated valves, into polyurethane PICCs are innovations designed to prevent infective and/or thrombotic complications. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A multicentre, parallel group, superiority randomised controlled trial with two experimental arms ((1) hydrophobic PICC (with pressure-activated valve); (2) chlorhexidine gluconate-impregnated PICC (with external clamp)) and one control group ((3) conventional polyurethane PICC (with external clamp)). Recruitment of 1098 adult and paediatric patients will take place over 2 years at three tertiary-referral hospitals in Queensland, Australia. Patients are eligible for inclusion if their PICC is to be inserted for medical treatment, with a vascular size sufficient to support a 4-Fr PICC or larger, and with informed consent. The primary outcome is PICC failure, a composite of thrombotic (venous thrombosis, breakage and occlusion) and infective complications (PICC-associated bloodstream infection and local infection). Secondary outcomes include: all-cause PICC complication; thrombotic complications; infective complications; adverse events (local or systemic reaction); PICC dwell time; patient/parent satisfaction; and healthcare costs.

During starvation, cytoplasmic components are randomly sequestered into large double‐membrane vesicles called autophagosomes and delivered into the lysosome/vacuole where they are destroyed. Cells are able to modulate autophagy in response to their needs, and under certain circumstances, cargoes, such as aberrant protein aggregates, organelles, and bacteria can be selectively and exclusively incorporated into autophagosomes. As a result, this pathway plays an active role in many physiological processes, and it is induced in numerous pathological situations because of its ability to rapidly eliminate unwanted structures. Despite the advances in understanding the functions of autophagy and the identification of several factors, named Atg proteins that mediate it, the mechanism that leads to autophagosome formation is still a mystery. A major challenge in unveiling this process arises from the fact that the origin and the transport mode of the lipids employed to compose these structures is unknown. This compendium will review and analyze the current data about the possible membrane source(s) with a particular emphasis on the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the leading model organism for the study of autophagosome biogenesis, and on mammalian cells. The information acquired investigating the pathogens that subvert autophagy in order to replicate in the host cells will also be discussed because it could provide important hints for solving this mystery.","Reggiori, Fulvio",Curr Top Dev Biol,350,1

However, only in the last decades has a novel and unusual property of the GA been discovered to form water-soluble, supramolecular complexes with a variety of lipophilic drugs. These complexes show significant advantages over other known delivery systems, in particular, due to strong pH sensitivity, the properties of GA self-associates. In the present study, a supramolecular complex formation of the hypotensive and antiarrhythmic drug nifedipine with GA has been studied at different pH values, corresponding to the different degrees of GA dissociation, including a fully dissociated state of GA. Both NMR experiments and molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate the existence of the nifedipine complex with GA at all dissociation states of GA. However, optical absorption experiments show the decrease of complex stability and solubility at pH > 6 when the GA molecule is fully deprotonated. It means the higher release rate of the drug in a neutral and basic environment compared with acid media. These results could form the basis of follow-up studies of GA self-associates as pH-controlled drug delivery systems.","Selyutina, Olga Yu.; Mastova, Anna V.; Shelepova, Ekaterina A.; Polyakov, Nikolay E.",Molecules,350,11

Health‐care and economic systems vary significantly across countries, as do policy responses, including testing, intermittent lockdowns, quarantine, contact tracing, mask wearing, and social distancing. Despite these challenges, the reported data can be used in many ways to help inform policy. We describe how to decompose the reported time series of confirmed cases and deaths into a trend, seasonal, and irregular component using machine learning methods. RESULTS: This decomposition enables statistical computation of measures of the mortality ratio and reproduction number for any country, and we conduct a counterfactual exercise assuming that the United States had a summer outcome in 2020 similar to that of the European Union. The decomposition is also used to produce forecasts of cases and deaths, and we undertake a forecast comparison which highlights the importance of seasonality in the data and the difficulties of forecasting too far into the future.

The objectives of this retrospective study were to report our experience of intraoperative adverse events (IOAEs) during fenestrated and branched stent grafting and to analyze the impact on clinical outcomes. METHODS: Consecutive patients treated with fenestrated and branched stent grafting in a tertiary vascular center between February 2006 and October 2013 were evaluated. A prospectively maintained computerized database was scrutinized and updated retrospectively. Intraoperative angiograms were reviewed to identify IOAEs, and adverse events were categorized into three types: target vessel cannulation, positioning of graft components, and intraoperative access. Clinical consequences of IOAEs were analyzed to ascertain whether they were responsible for death or moderate to severe postoperative complications. RESULTS: During the study period, 113 consecutive elective patients underwent fenestrated or branched stent grafting. Indications for treatment were asymptomatic complex abdominal aortic aneurysms (CAAAs, n = 89) and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs, n = 24). Stent grafts included fenestrated (n = 79) and branched (n = 17) Cook stent grafts (Cook Medical, Bloomington, Ind), Ventana (Endologix, Irvine, Calif) stent grafts (n = 9), and fenestrated Anaconda (Vascutek Terumo, Scotland, UK) stent grafts (n = 8). In-hospital mortality rates for the CAAA and TAAA groups were 6.7% (6 of 89) and 12.5% (3 of 24), respectively. Twenty-eight moderate to severe complications occurred in 21 patients (18.6%). Spinal cord ischemia was recorded in six patients, three of which resolved completely. A total of 37 IOAEs were recorded in 34 (30.1%) patients (22 CAAAs and 12 TAAAs). Of 37 IOAEs, 15 (40.5%) resulted in no clinical consequence in 15 patients; 17 (45.9%) were responsible for moderate to severe complications in 16 patients, and five (13.5%) led to death in four patients. The composite end point death/nonfatal moderate to severe complication occurred more frequently in patients with IOAEs compared with patients without IOAEs (20 of 34 vs 12 of 79; P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: In this contemporary series, IOAEs were relatively frequent during branched or fenestrated stenting procedures and were often responsible for significant complications.","Cochennec, Frédéric; Kobeiter, Hicham; Gohel, Manj S.; Majewski, Marek; Marzelle, Jean; Desgranges, Pascal; Allaire, Eric; Becquemin, Jean Pierre",J Vasc Surg,350,26

The aim of this study is to investigate the knowledge, common misconceptions, barriers, and the compliance of the community with the use of face masks for the prevention of COVID-19. A validated questionnaire was administered to the participants through a web link by using various social media. The collected data were statistically analyzed for significant differences according to demographic variables. The average knowledge of face masks and their role in preventing COVID-19 transmission was 95.64%, with no differences among most of the demographical factors. Older groups and females demonstrated a better attitude towards wearing face masks than other groups did (p<0.001). Another significant difference in the participant’s attitude was noticed between the various educational levels, employment, and nationality (p<0.001). Of the total respondents, 88.2% encouraged wearing face masks. Misconceptions about wearing face masks were very low. The frequency of wearing face masks at public places, workplaces, or social gatherings was 87.2%, 80.5%, and 47.5% respectively. There was a significant variation in the compliance with wearing face masks between the various groups based on age, gender, nationality, and employment status (p<0.001). The inconvenience in wearing face masks was reported by 36.3%. Face irritation and ear pain were reported by 70.2% and 43.5%, respectively. The inconvenience of wearing face masks with eyeglasses was reported by 44.3% of those wearing eyeglasses. In general, the study demonstrated a good attitude among participants towards wearing face masks. Although the respondents in the study were aware of the benefits of wearing face masks, the barriers may have decreased their desire to do so. These barriers include difficulty in breathing, discomfort, face irritation, and ear pain.","Al Naam, Yaser A.; Elsafi, Salah H.; Alkharraz, Zeyad S.; Alfahad, Othman A.; Al-Jubran, Khalid M.; Al Zahrani, Eidan M.",PLoS One,350,16

PUs are a class of versatile polymers made up of polyols and isocyanates. Renewable vegetable oils are promising resources for the development of ecofriendly polyols and the corresponding PUs. Researchers are interested in NEVOs because they provide an alternative to critical global food issues. The cultivation of plant resources for NEVOs can also be popularized globally by utilizing marginal land or wastelands. Polyols can be prepared from NEVOs following different conversion routes, including esterification, etherification, amidation, ozonolysis, hydrogenation, hydroformylation, thio-ene, acrylation, and epoxidation. These polyols can be incorporated into the PU network for coating applications. Metal surface corrosion and microbial growth are severe problems that cause enormous economic losses annually. These problems can be overcome by NEVO-based PU coatings, incorporating functional ingredients such as corrosion inhibitors and antimicrobial agents. The preferred coatings have great potential in high performance, smart, and functional applications, including in biomedical fields, to cope with emerging threats such as COVID-19.","Patil, Chandrashekhar K.; Jung, Dong Wook; Jirimali, Harishchandra D.; Baik, Joon Hyun; Gite, Vikas V.; Hong, Sung Chul",Polymers (Basel),350,1

By drug repurposing, affordable therapeutics could be supplied worldwide in the present pandemic context. Targeting the nucleoprotein N of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus could be a strategy to impede viral replication and possibly other essential functions associated with viral N. The antiviral properties of naproxen, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that was previously demonstrated to be active against Influenza A virus, were evaluated against SARS-CoV-2. Intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy, fluorescence anisotropy, and dynamic light scattering assays demonstrated naproxen binding to the nucleoprotein of SARS-Cov-2 as predicted by molecular modeling. Naproxen impeded recombinant N oligomerization and inhibited viral replication in infected cells. In VeroE6 cells and reconstituted human primary respiratory epithelium models of SARS-CoV-2 infection, naproxen specifically inhibited viral replication and protected the bronchial epithelia against SARS-CoV-2-induced damage. No inhibition of viral replication was observed with paracetamol or the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib. Thus, among the NSAID tested, only naproxen combined antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties.

Ecuador’s authoritarian legacy has forced civil society and social organizations to adopt ‘coping strategies’, while large protests recently derived into violent struggles. The country has been severely hit by the COVID-19 pandemic amid corruption scandals involving hospital and food purchases by government during the response. This study critically examines how Ecuador’s government took into consideration ‘community participation’ as a value and tenet of health promotion. Our systematic textual analysis focuses on 53 consecutive resolutions by the National Emergency Operations Committee (EOC) leading the decision-making processes, which, explicitly requires community participation. Results show that the ‘lifecycle’ of the central government’s evolving policy framing centered on law enforcement and the private sector, followed by the social sector. Further, there is no evidence of stakeholders from civil society or organizations taking part in decision-making. Having legitimized the exclusion of community participation in Ecuador’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is possible that the government will fail to consider the wider social implications of its impact. In particular, the limits to local governments becoming informed and making decisions without mediation by the National EOC will further impede community participation in health decision-making in the future. This implies that local knowledge and experiences will also not inform health policy.","Torres, Irene; López-Cevallos, Daniel",Health Promot Int,350,1

Here, we sought to examine the antibody immune competence of children and adolescents with prevalent inflammatory rheumatic diseases, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) and juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus (JSLE), against the seasonal human coronavirus (HCoV)-OC43 that frequently infects this age group. Methods Sera were collected from JIA (n=118), JDM (n=49) and JSLE (n=30) patients, and from healthy control (n=54) children and adolescents, prior to the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic. We employed sensitive flow cytometry-based assays to determine titres of antibodies that reacted with the spike and nucleoprotein of HCoV-OC43 and cross-reacted with the spike and nucleoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, and compared with respective titres in sera from patients with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and adolescents (MIS-C). Findings Despite immune dysfunction and immunosuppressive treatment, JIA, JDM and JSLE patients maintained comparable or stronger humoral responses than healthier peers, dominated by IgG antibodies to HCoV-OC43 spike, and harboured IgG antibodies that cross-reacted with SARS-CoV-2 spike. In contrast, responses to HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV-2 nucleoproteins exhibited delayed age-dependent class-switching and were not elevated in JIA, JDM and JSLE patients, arguing against increased exposure. Conclusions Consequently, autoimmune rheumatic diseases and their treatment were associated with a favourable ratio of spike to nucleoprotein antibodies.","Deakin, Claire T.; Cornish, Georgina H.; Ng, Kevin W.; Faulkner, Nikhil; Bolland, William; Hope, Joshua; Rosa, Annachiara; Harvey, Ruth; Hussain, Saira; Earl, Christopher; Jebson, Bethany R.; Wilkinson, Meredyth G.Ll.; Marshall, Lucy R.; O’Brien, Kathryn; Rosser, Elizabeth C.; Radziszewska, Anna; Peckham, Hannah; Patel, Harsita; Heaney, Judith; Rickman, Hannah; Paraskevopoulou, Stavroula; Houlihan, Catherine F.; Spyer, Moira J.; Gamblin, Steve J.; McCauley, John; Nastouli, Eleni; Levin, Michael; Cherepanov, Peter; Ciurtin, Coziana; Wedderburn, Lucy R.; Kassiotis, George",Med (N Y),350,24

We aimed to assess safety and immunogenicity of the two novel OPV candidates compared with a monovalent Sabin OPV in children and infants. METHODS: We did two single-centre, multi-site, partly-masked, randomised trials in healthy cohorts of children (aged 1–4 years) and infants (aged 18–22 weeks) in Panama: a control phase 4 study with monovalent Sabin OPV2 before global cessation of monovalent OPV2 use, and a phase 2 study with low and high doses of two novel OPV2 candidates. All participants received one OPV2 vaccination and subsets received two doses 28 days apart. Parents reported solicited and unsolicited adverse events. Type 2 poliovirus neutralising antibodies were measured at days 0, 7, 28, and 56, and stool viral shedding was assessed up to 28 days post-vaccination. Primary objectives were to assess safety in all participants and non-inferiority of novel OPV2 day 28 seroprotection versus monovalent OPV2 in infants (non-inferiority margin 10%). These studies were registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02521974 and NCT03554798. FINDINGS: The control study took place between Oct 23, 2015, and April 29, 2016, and the subsequent phase 2 study between Sept 19, 2018, and Sept 30, 2019. 150 children (50 in the control study and 100 of 129 assessed for eligibility in the novel OPV2 study) and 684 infants (110 of 114 assessed for eligibility in the control study and 574 of 684 assessed for eligibility in the novel OPV2 study) were enrolled and received at least one study vaccination. Vaccinations were safe and well tolerated with no causally associated serious adverse events or important medical events in any group. Solicited and unsolicited adverse events were overwhelmingly mild or moderate irrespective of vaccine or dose. Nearly all children were seroprotected at baseline, indicating high baseline immunity. In children, the seroprotection rate 28 days after one dose was 100% for monovalent OPV2 and both novel OPV2 candidates. In infants at day 28, 91 (94% [95% CI 87–98]) of 97 were seroprotected after receiving monovalent OPV2, 134 (94% [88–97]) of 143 after high-dose novel OPV2-c1, 122 (93% [87–97]) of 131 after low-dose novel OPV2-c1, 138 (95% [90–98]) of 146 after high-dose novel OPV2-c2, and 115 (91% [84–95]) of 127 after low-dose novel OPV2-c2. Non-inferiority was shown for low-dose and high-dose novel OPV2-c1 and high-dose novel OPV2-c2 despite monovalent OPV2 recipients having higher baseline immunity. INTERPRETATION: Both novel OPV2 candidates were safe, well tolerated, and immunogenic in children and infants. Novel OPV2 could be an important addition to our resources against poliovirus given the current epidemiological situation.

Overcoming the virus is partly dependent on the holistic wellbeing of frontline health workers. Implications of COVID-19 on frontline health workers in West Africa could be substantial given the limited resources and logistics. This scoping review maps available literature on the impact of COVID-19 on frontline health workers in West Africa. Materials and methodsLiterature on the impact of COVID-19 on frontline health workers in West Africa were searched in six databases namely Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar, Africa Journals Online (AJOL) and CINAHL. Further search was done across websites of the ministries of health of West African countries and notable organisations. We conducted a narrative synthesis of the findings taking cognisance of the overarching purpose of the study and the research question. ResultsOf the 67 studies identified, 19 were included in the final synthesis. Three main themes emerged and these are impact of COVID-19 on frontline health workers, drivers of susceptibility to COVID-19 and government/donor support. A greater number of the studies originated from Nigeria. Each study reported at least one impact of COVID-19 on frontline health workers in West Africa. The impacts included death, fear, unwillingness to attend to COVID-19 patients and stigmatisation. Some health workers were not adhering to the safety protocols coupled with periodic shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) and thereby had an increased susceptibility. ConclusionBeing the first scoping review on the impact of COVID-19 on frontline health workers in West Africa, the study has illustrated the urgent need for West African governments to enact laws/rules that would compel all frontline health workers to adhere to all the COVID-19 protocols at the workplace. To end intermittent shortage or issue of inadequate PPEs, governments ought to liaise with local industries by empowering them, providing financial support and creating a conducive atmosphere for them to produce cost effective PPEs using available local resources.

We trace the evolution of two local food systems (Baltimore County, Maryland and Chester County, Pennsylvania) over six years, including a dataset of over 2690 market connections (edges) between 1520 locations (nodes). Longitudinal social network analysis reveals how the architecture, actor network centrality, magnitude, and spatiality of these supply chains shifted during the 2012–2018 time period. Our findings demonstrate that, despite growth in the number of farmers’ markets, grocery stores, farms and restaurants in both counties, each local food system also experienced high turnover rates. Over 80% of the market connections changed during the study period. Farms, farmers’ markets, and grocery stores showed a 40–50% ‘survival’ rate, indicating their role in sustaining local food systems over longer time periods. Other actors, such as restaurants, had a much higher turnover rate within the network. Both food systems became more close-knit and consolidated as the center of gravity for both local food systems pulled away from urban areas toward rural farmland. Evidence of both growth and decay within local food systems provides a new understanding of the social networks behind local food markets.","Brinkley, Catherine; Manser, Gwyneth M.; Pesci, Sasha",Agric Human Values,350,1

Controlling these viruses in birds as well as understanding their emergence into, and transmission amongst, humans will require considerable ingenuity and understanding of how different species defend themselves. The type I interferon-coordinated response constitutes the major antiviral innate defence. Although interferon was discovered in chicken cells, details of the response, particularly the identity of hundreds of stimulated genes, are far better described in mammals. Viruses induce interferon-stimulated genes but they also regulate the expression of many hundreds of cellular metabolic and structural genes to facilitate their replication. This study focusses on the potentially anti-viral genes by identifying those induced just by interferon in primary chick embryo fibroblasts. Three transcriptomic technologies were exploited: RNA-seq, a classical 3′-biased chicken microarray and a high density, “sense target”, whole transcriptome chicken microarray, with each recognising 120–150 regulated genes (curated for duplication and incorrect assignment of some microarray probesets). Overall, the results are considered robust because 128 of the compiled, curated list of 193 regulated genes were detected by two, or more, of the technologies.

Here we show that RTX performs comparably to the other assays sanctioned by the CDC and validated in kit format. We demonstrate two modes of RTX use – (i) dye-based RT-qPCR assays that require only RTX polymerase, and (ii) TaqMan RT-qPCR assays that use a combination of RTX and Taq DNA polymerases (as the RTX exonuclease does not degrade a TaqMan probe). We also provide straightforward recipes for the purification of this alternative reagent.

The antibodies were characterized by neutralization test, hemagglutination inhibition test, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblotting. Neutralizing antibody titers of polyclonal antisera ranged from 1:1280 to 1:40 000. Only one out of 908 hybridoma colonies tested secreted antibodies with neutralizing activity. By ELISA, polyclonal sera exhibited high background reactions that could be significantly reduced by treatment with kaolin in the case of rabbit sera. Attempts to establish an ELISA for BEC antigen detection based on polyclonal sera failed due to low sensitivity and specificity. Optimal results were achieved when a mixture of two monoclonal antibodies was coated onto microplates for antigen capture, while rabbit hyperimmune serum served as detecting antibodies in an indirect assay. The combination of the two monoclonal antibodies did not increase sensitivity synergistically, but in a compensatory fashion, probably because of epitope differences between BEC field strains.","Czerny, C.-P.; Eichhorn, W.",Veterinary Microbiology,350,1

Human respiratory coronaviruses (HCoV) can infect neural cells, persist in human brain, and activate myelin-reactive T cells. As a means of understanding the human infection, we characterized in vivo the neurotropic and neuroinvasive properties of HCoV-OC43 through the development of an experimental animal model. Virus inoculation of 21-day postnatal C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice led to a generalized infection of the whole CNS, demonstrating HCoV-OC43 neuroinvasiveness and neurovirulence. This acute infection targeted neurons, which underwent vacuolation and degeneration while infected regions presented strong microglial reactivity and inflammatory reactions. Damage to the CNS was not immunologically mediated and microglial reactivity was instead a consequence of direct virus-mediated neuronal injury. Although this acute encephalitis appears generally similar to that induced by murine coronaviruses, an important difference rests in the prominent spongiform-like degeneration that could trigger neuropathology in surviving animals.","Jacomy, Hélène; Talbot, Pierre J",Virology,350,29

Not only health and medical problems but also the decline in life quality and economic activity due to the suspension of social activities cannot be disregarded. It is assumed that the virus is transmitted through coughing and sneezing; however, the possibility of airborne infection by aerosols containing viruses scattered in the air has become a popular topic recently. In airborne infections, the risk of infection increases when the mucous membrane is exposed to exhaled aerosols for a significant amount of time. Therefore, in this study, we visualize human breath using the smoke of electronic cigarettes as tracer particles. Exhalation when speaking was visualized for four human posture patterns. The result shows that the exhaled breath is affected by the body wall temperature; it rises when it remains in the boundary layer by wearing a mask. On the other hand, without a mask, it initially flows downward due to the structure of the nose and mouth, so it flows downward due to inertia and diffuses randomly. This finding is effective in reducing the risk of infection during face-to-face customer service.","Ishii, Keiko; Ohno, Yoshiko; Oikawa, Maiko; Onishi, Noriko",Phys Fluids (1994),350,26

This year in view of COVID-19 pandemic, attitudes of HCWs towards vaccination are particularly important. A cross-sectional study was completed to understand how to best encourage and facilitate the vaccination of HCWs based on the previous years’ findings. METHODS: An online survey was disseminated to all hospital staff via electronic channels. The clinical audit sphinx software was used for data collection and analysis. RESULTS: The total number of responses was n = 728, almost double the rate from 2018 (N = 393). A total of 78% (N = 551) of participants were vaccinated last year. A total of 94% (N = 677) of participants reported their intention to be vaccinated this year. The main barriers listed were being unable to find time (32%, N = 36), side effects (30%, N = 33) and thinking that it does not work (21%, N = 23). The most popular suggestions for how to increase uptake were more mobile immunisation clinics (72%, N = 517) and more information on the vaccine (50%, N = 360).

As we move forward through the next phases of the pandemic, we will need a decision-making system that allows us to remain nimble as clinicians to meet our patient’s needs while also working with a new framework of healthcare operations. Here, we present our quality improvement process for the adaptation and application of the Medically Necessary Time-Sensitive (MeNTS) toolto gynecologic surgical services beyond the initial COVID response and into recovery of surgical services; with analysis of the reliability of the modified-MeNTS tool in our multi-site safety net hospital network. This multicenter study evaluated the gynecology surgical case volume at three tertiary acute care safety net institutions within the LA County Department of Health Services: Harbor-UCLA (HUMC), Olive View Medical Center (OVMC), and Los Angeles County + University of Southern California (LAC+USC). We describe our modified-Delphi approach to adapt the MeNTS tool in a structured fashion and its application to gynecologic surgical services. Blinded reviewers engaged in a three-round iterative adaptation and final scoring utilizing the modified tool. The cohort consisted of 392 female consecutive gynecology patients across three Los Angeles County Hospitals awaiting scheduled procedures in the surgical queue.The majority of patients were Latina (74.7%) and premenopausal (67.1%). Over half (52.4%) of the patients had cardiovascular disease, while 13.0% had lung disease, and 13.8% had diabetes. The most common indications for surgery were abnormal uterine bleeding (33.2%), pelvic organ prolapse (19.6%) and presence of an adnexal mass (14.3%). Minimally invasive approaches via laparoscopy, robotic-assisted laparoscopy, or vaginal surgery was the predominant planned surgical route (54.8%). Modified-MeNTS scores assumed a normal distribution across all patients within our cohort (Median 33, Range 18–52). Overall, ICC across all three institutions demonstrated “good” interrater reliability (0.72). ICC within institutions at HUMC and OVMC were categorized as “good” interrater reliability, while LAC-USC interrater reliability was categorized as “excellent” (HUMC 0.73, OVMC 0.65, LAC+USC 0.77). The modified-MeNTS tool performed well across a range of patients and procedures with a normal distribution of scores and high reliability between raters.

SARS-CoV-2 causes the disease COVID-19, which can affect several human organs. Abdominal pain is one of the known symptoms, but little is known about acute pancreatitis as a complication. As well, knowledge about viral transmission in families is limited. This case report describes MIS-C and acalculous acute pancreatitis in a child who was a member of a family in which four of five members had COVID-19. CASE REPORT: A previously healthy family was infected by SARS-CoV-2 from an unknown source. The 13-year-old daughter was infected by SARS-CoV-2 and symptomatic during two periods, with an asymptomatic interval in-between. During the first period, she had transient and mild upper respiratory symptoms which was followed four weeks later by a secondary severe illness. At that point, there was inflammation in multiple organs and signs of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) and a Kawasaki-like disease with skin rash, scalded skin in hands and conjunctivitis. Myocarditis, bronchopneumonia, pancreatitis, and hepatopathy without encephalopathy were noted. She required assisted ventilation for 5 days. There were laboratory signs of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. The multisystem inflammation was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) once a day for four days and immunotherapy (high dose methylprednisolone (IV) once a day, for 12 days, then tapered over 4 weeks, anakinra (IV) four times daily for 12 days), low molecular weight heparin for 22 days and salicylates for 6 weeks leading to full restoration of health. The two brothers and mother in the family had mild to moderate COVID-19 infections. The father was not affected despite close contact with his children. The household transmission and clinical course and outcome are described. No further known COVID-19 infection occurred in the neighborhood during or immediately after the family cluster was discovered. CONCLUSION: Penetrance and severity of COVID-19 can vary in family clusters. One adolescent showed a two-phase course with severe infection. This case report highlights MIS-C and acute pancreatitis as a complication associated with COVID-19 in children.","Abbas, Maher; Törnhage, Carl-Johan",Int Med Case Rep J,350,11

Two independent authors extracted the data, and the senior author solved the discrepancies. RESULTS: Sixteen documents were included. Data categorized into four sections: principals, general recommendations for individuals, health key metrics, and in-phases strategy. The number of phases or stages differed from three to six, with a minimum of two weeks considered for each one. Health key metrics were categorized into four subsets: sufficient preventive capacities, appropriate diagnostic capacity, appropriate epidemiological monitoring, and sufficient health system capacity. These metrics were used as the criteria for progressing or returning over the roadmap, which guarantees a roadmap’s dynamicity. Noticeably, few roadmaps did not mention the criteria that may alter the dynamicity of their roadmap. When some areas face new surges, the roadmap’s dynamicity is essential, and it is vital to describe the criteria to stop the reopening process and implement the restrictions again.

Since pandemic outbreaks are relatively infrequent, there is a dearth of evidence addressing the following questions: (i) Have the resources invested in strategic and routine communication for past pandemic outbreaks yielded public health preparedness benefits? (ii) Have past efforts sensitized people to pay attention to new pandemic threats? The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) that was followed closely by major media outlets in the USA provides an opportunity to examine the relationship between exposure to public communication about epidemics and public awareness and knowledge about new risks. METHODS: In December, 2013, we surveyed a nationally representative sample of 627 American adults and examined the associations between people's awareness to prior pandemics and their awareness of and knowledge about MERS. RESULTS: Awareness of prior pandemics was significantly associated with awareness and knowledge of MERS. The most common sources from which people first heard about MERS were also identified.

It has affected multiple countries over time. The best strategy to reduce the burden of influenza is through vaccination whose efficacy varies with respect to the circulating strains. This study was performed to better understand the molecular evolution of influenza A(H3N2) and assess vaccine efficacy in Cameroon. Complete sequences of three gene segments were obtained from 2014 to 2016 influenza seasons in Cameroon. Hemagglutinin (HA), Neuraminidase (NA) and matrix (M) genes of 35 A(H3N2) virus strains were amplified and sequenced. Predicted vaccine efficacy was measured using the P(epitope) model. Phylogenetic analysis of the HA gene showed that all Cameroonian strains had evolved away from the 3C.1-A/Texas/50/2012-like clade. Globally, 2014 virus strains clustered with the 2015–2016 vaccine strain, 3C.3a-A/Switzerland/9715293/2013, whereas 2015 and 2016 virus strains clustered with the 2016–2017 vaccine strain, 3C.2a-A/HongKong/4801/2014. In order to determine the genotypic drug susceptibility to neuraminidase inhibitors and amantadine, the NA and M2 protein coding sequences were analyzed. There was no strain with characteristic mutation for resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors, per contra; all strains possessed the substitution S31N, peculiar of resistance to adamantanes. There was drift in influenza A(H3N2) dominant epitopes B (2014 and 2015) to epitopes A (2016) with a theoretical efficiency in vaccine ranging from low to moderate. The presence of several antigenic site mutations among H3N2 virus strains between 2014–2016 influenza seasons in Cameroon confirms the progressing evolution of circulating H3N2 strains.","Monamele, Gwladys C.; Vernet, Marie-Astrid; Njankouo, Mohammed R.; Victoir, Kathleen; Akoachere, Jane Francis; Anong, Damian; Njouom, Richard",PLoS One,350,5

These encounters can lead to multiple outcomes from symbiotic homeostasis to mutual annihilation, undergo multiple cycles of latency and lysogeny, and lead to coevolution of the interacting genomes. Such systems pose numerous challenges but also some advantages to modeling, especially in terms of functional, mathematical genome representations. The main challenges for the modeling process start with the conceptual definition of a genome for instance in the case of host-integrated viral genomes. Furthermore, hardly understood influences of the activity of either genome on the other(s) via direct and indirect mechanisms amplify the needs for a coherent description of genome activity. Finally, genetic and local environmental heterogeneities in both the host’s cellular and the pathogen populations need to be considered in multiscale modeling efforts.
