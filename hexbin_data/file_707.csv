To overcome uncertainties due to intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) resolution limitation, IVUS and optical coherence tomography (OCT) coronary plaque image data were combined together to obtain accurate and reliable cap thickness data, stress/strain calculations, and reliable plaque progression predictions. IVUS, OCT, and angiography baseline and follow-up data were collected from nine patients (mean age: 69; m: 5) at Cardiovascular Research Foundation with informed consent obtained. IVUS and OCT slices were coregistered and merged to form IVUS + OCT (IO) slices. A total of 114 matched slices (IVUS and OCT, baseline and follow-up) were obtained, and 3D thin-layer models were constructed to obtain stress and strain values. A generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) and least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) method were used to predict cap thickness change using nine morphological and mechanical risk factors. Prediction accuracies by all combinations (511) of those predictors with both IVUS and IO data were compared to identify optimal predictor(s) with their best accuracies. For the nine patients, the average of minimum cap thickness from IVUS was 0.17 mm, which was 26.08% lower than that from IO data (average = 0.23 mm). Patient variations of the individual errors ranged from ‒58.11 to 20.37%. For maximum cap stress between IO and IVUS, patient variations of the individual errors ranged from ‒30.40 to 46.17%. Patient variations of the individual errors of maximum cap strain values ranged from ‒19.90 to 17.65%. For the GLMM method, the optimal combination predictor using IO data had AUC (area under the ROC curve) = 0.926 and highest accuracy = 90.8%, vs. AUC = 0.783 and accuracy = 74.6% using IVUS data. For the LSSVM method, the best combination predictor using IO data had AUC = 0.838 and accuracy = 75.7%, vs. AUC = 0.780 and accuracy = 69.6% using IVUS data. This preliminary study demonstrated improved plaque cap progression prediction accuracy using accurate cap thickness data from IO slices and the differences in cap thickness, stress/strain values, and prediction results between IVUS and IO data. Large-scale studies are needed to verify our findings.","Lv, Rui; Maehara, Akiko; Matsumura, Mitsuaki; Wang, Liang; Zhang, Caining; Huang, Mengde; Guo, Xiaoya; Samady, Habib; Giddens, Don.

The noninvasive dermatoscopic method is a popular method for observing and diagnosing skin cancer. Because this method is based on ocular inference, the skin cancer diagnosis by the dermatologists is difficult, especially in the early stages of the disease. Artificial intelligence is a proper complementary tool that can be used alongside the experts to increase the accuracy of the diagnosis. In the present study, a new computer-aided method has been introduced for the diagnosis of the skin cancer. The method is designed based on combination of deep learning and a newly introduced metaheuristic algorithm, namely, Wildebeest Herd Optimization (WHO) Algorithm. The method uses an Inception convolutional neural network for the initial features' extraction. Afterward, the WHO algorithm has been employed for selecting the useful features to decrease the analysis time complexity. The method is then performed to an ISIC-2008 skin cancer dataset. Final results of the feature selection based on the proposed WHO are compared with three other algorithms, and the results have indicated good results for the system. Finally, the total diagnosis system has been compared with five other methods to indicate its effectiveness against the studied methods. Final results showed that the proposed method has the best results than the comparative methods.","Zhou, Biying; Arandian, Behdad",Comput Intell Neurosci,707,5

As pathogens evolve tactics for evading antibiotics, therapies decline in efficacy and must be replaced, distinguishing antibiotics from most other forms of drug development. Together with a slow and expensive antibiotic development pipeline, the proliferation of drug-resistant pathogens drives urgent interest in computational methods that promise to expedite candidate discovery. Strides in artificial intelligence (AI) have encouraged its application to multiple dimensions of computer-aided drug design, with increasing application to antibiotic discovery. This review describes AI-facilitated advances in the discovery of both small molecule antibiotics and antimicrobial peptides. Beyond the essential prediction of antimicrobial activity, emphasis is also given to antimicrobial compound representation, determination of drug-likeness traits, antimicrobial resistance, and de novo molecular design. Given the urgency of the antimicrobial resistance crisis, we analyze uptake of open science best practices in AI-driven antibiotic discovery and argue for openness and reproducibility as a means of accelerating preclinical research. Finally, trends in the literature and areas for future inquiry are discussed, as artificially intelligent enhancements to drug discovery at large offer many opportunities for future applications in antibiotic development.","Melo, Marcelo C.

These oscillatory stimuli propagate through solid substrates, are sensed by mechanoreceptors in our body and give rise to perceptual attributes such as vibrotactile pitch (i.e. the perception of how high or low a vibration’s frequency is). Here, we establish a mechanistic relationship between vibrotactile pitch perception and the physical properties of vibrations using behavioral tasks, in which vibratory stimuli were delivered to the human fingertip or the mouse forelimb. The resulting perceptual reports were analyzed with a model demonstrating that physically different combinations of vibration frequencies and amplitudes can produce equal pitch perception. We found that the perceptually indistinguishable but physically different stimuli follow a common computational principle in mouse and human. It dictates that vibrotactile pitch perception is shifted with increases in amplitude toward the frequency of highest vibrotactile sensitivity. These findings suggest the existence of a fundamental relationship between the seemingly unrelated concepts of spectral sensitivity and pitch perception.","Prsa, Mario; Kilicel, Deniz; Nourizonoz, Ali; Lee, Kuo-Sheng; Huber, Daniel",Nat Commun,707,5

ER measurements were carried out according to the Werner’s method on two (overloaded) horizontal subsurface wetlands (HSF-CW1 and HSF-CW2) operated in parallel since the end of 2017, while still achieving satisfactory treatment efficiencies. Layered clog-induced preferential flow pathways through the HSF-CW beds and premature deterioration of the wetland’s liner with a possible development of dead zones associated with a low/heterogeneous density of vegetation could be confirmed by analysis of ER profiles.

Despite the superiority of enteral nutrition (EN), total parenteral nutrition (PN) remains the standard therapy for anastomotic leakage. After introduction of EN via a nasointestinal tube for patients with anastomotic leakage in our institution in 2006, standard nutritional therapy was shifted gradually from PN to EN. The present preliminary study evaluates the safety and feasibility of EN via a nasointestinal tube for anastomotic leakage after gastric cancer surgery. METHODS Retrospective review of all gastric cancer surgeries from 2005 to 2009 (n = 2,588) revealed 53 patients (2.0%) who developed anastomotic leakage and were treated conservatively. EN was performed via a nasointestinal tube inserted using a guidewire under X-ray fluoroscopy. Clinical outcomes and complications following EN were compared with those in patients treated with PN (historical control group). The severity of complications was evaluated according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. RESULTS Fifty patients were included in the final analysis (three patients died): 29 patients managed by EN and 21 managed by PN. There were no significant differences in clinical outcomes and the frequency of total complications between the two groups; however, there were fewer tube/catheter-related complications in the EN compared with the PN group (1 vs. 7, respectively; P < 0.01). There was one epistaxis (3.4%; grade I) in the EN group and seven catheter infections (33.3%; grade II) in the PN group. The risk of grade II or higher complications was greater in the PN than the EN group (11 vs. 4, respectively; P < 0.01), with the greatest difference seen in the incidence of catheter infections. On days 7, 10, and 15 after diagnosis of leakage, the white blood cell count and C-reactive protein levels were higher in the PN than in the EN group. The PN group required prolonged intravenous antibiotic infusion (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Nasointestinal tube insertion with EN can be performed safely for patients with anastomotic leakage. A major advantage of EN is fewer infectious complications. Because EN was not inferior to PN in terms of clinical outcome, we recommended that it is used in patients with anastomotic leakage after gastric cancer surgery.","Akashi, Yoshimasa; Hiki, Naoki; Nunobe, Souya; Jiang, Xiaohua; Yamaguchi, Toshiharu",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,707,1

Patient ameliorated significantly his disease only with medical therapy. CASE PRESENTATION A 54-year-old man without significant anatomical findings with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and non-acid gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) disease whose Apnea- hypopnea index (AHI) was significantly reduced with the intake of 500 mg of sodium alginate twice a day for 6 months. Conventional digestive tests such as esophagoscopy and simple- and double-channel 24-h pH-metry suggested mild GERD. Conventional proton-pump inhibitor treatment with pantoprazole (40 mg daily) was started without any improvement in his sleep. Multichannel intraluminal 24-h impedanciometry indicated the presence of severe pathological GER of gaseous origin. The patient's AHI decreased from 25.3 at baseline to 8 after treatment with sodium alginate. A drug-induced sleep endoscopy study showed the changes before and after this treatment and was helpful for the diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS Thus, medical treatment can be a therapeutic option in some patients with OSA. Multichannel 24-h impedanciometry should be performed when nonacid GERD is suspected.","O'Connor-Reina, Carlos; Garcia, Jose Maria Ignacio; Baptista, Peter; Garcia-Iriarte, Maria Teresa; Alba, Carlos Casado; Perona, Monica; Borrmann, Paz Francisca; Alcala, Laura Rodriguez; Plaza, Guillermo",Journal of otolaryngology - head & neck surgery = Le Journal d'oto-rhino-laryngologie et de chirurgie cervico-faciale,707,1

However, there has been a lack of focus on fine-tuning the frictional properties of scaffolds for cartilage tissue engineering as well as understanding their interactions with synovial fluid constituents. Proteoglycan-4 (PRG4) and hyaluronan (HA) are macromolecules within synovial fluid that play key roles as boundary mode lubricants during cartilage surface interactions. The overall objective of this study was to characterize the role PRG4 and HA play in the lubricating function of collagen-glycosaminoglycan (GAG) scaffolds for cartilage repair. As a first step towards this goal, we aimed to develop a suitable in vitro friction test to establish the boundary mode lubrication parameters for collagen-GAG scaffolds articulated against glass in a phosphate buffered saline (PBS) bath. Subsequently, we sought to leverage this system to determine the effect of physiological synovial fluid lubricants, PRG4 and HA, on the frictional properties of collagen-GAG scaffolds, with scaffolds hydrated in PBS and bovine synovial fluid (bSF) serving as negative and positive controls, respectively. At all compressive strains examined (ε = 0.1-0.5), fluid depressurization within hydrated collagen-GAG scaffolds was >99% complete at ½ minute. The coefficient of friction was stable at all compressive strains (ranging from a low 0.103 ± 0.010 at ε = 0.3 up to 0.121 ± 0.015 at ε = 0.4) and indicative of boundary-mode conditions. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that PRG4 from recombinant human (rh) and bovine sources adsorbed to collagen-GAG scaffolds and the coefficient of friction for scaffolds immersed in rhPRG4 (0.067 ± 0.027) and normal bSF (0.056 ± 0.020) solution decreased compared to PBS (0.118 ± 0.21, both p < 0.05, at ε = 0.2). The ability of the adsorbed rhPRG4 to reduce friction on the scaffolds indicates that its incorporation within collagen-GAG biomaterials may enhance their lubricating ability as potential tissue-engineered cartilage replacements. To conclude, this study reports the development of an in vitro friction test capable of characterizing the coefficient of friction of ECM-derived scaffolds tested in a range of synovial fluid lubricants and demonstrates frictional properties as a potential design parameter for implants and materials for soft tissue replacement.","Matheson, Austyn R; Sheehy, Eamon J; Jay, Gregory D; Scott, W Michael; O'Brien, Fergal J; Schmidt, Tannin A",Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials,707,1

Methods A preeclampsia rat model was established, and the effects of low molecular heparin on preeclampsia via the p38MAPK signaling pathway were analyzed based on intervention of the rats with different combinations of low molecular heparin and p38MAPK signaling pathway activator. Furthermore, a hypoxia/reoxygenation model of trophoblasts in vitro was established to explore the effects of low molecular heparin on trophoblasts via the p38MAPK signaling pathway. Results After treatment with low molecular heparin, pregnant rats in the heparin group showed significantly decreased blood pressure, 24 h proteinuria, and p38MAPK protein levels in placenta tissues and decreased apoptosis rate of placenta tissue cells (all P < 0.05) and showed more fetal rats and lowered weight of them (both P < 0.05) but showed no significant change in the weight of placenta (all P > 0.05).

MATERIALS AND METHODS In a cross-over study, five fasting volunteers were asked to drink two standard consumptions of commercially available alcoholic beverages, including beer (Stella Artois®, 500 mL, 5.2% ethanol), wine (Blanc du Blanc®, 200 mL, 11% ethanol) and whisky (Gallantry Whisky®, 80 mL, 40% ethanol). The volunteers finished drinking beer within 10 min and wine or whisky within 5 min. Ethanol concentrations in gastric and duodenal fluids, aspirated as a function of time, were analyzed by headspace gas chromatography. RESULTS In all three conditions, the average gastric profile shows a maximum ethanol concentration (Cmax) at 7 min, while the mean duodenal profiles have a Tmax at 20, 7 and 12 min for beer, wine and whisky, respectively. The median gastric ethanol Cmax (min-max) for the beer, wine and whisky conditions amounts to 4.1% (3.1-4.1), 4.1% (2.6-7.3) and 11.4% (6.3-21.1), respectively. The mean duodenal profiles follow the same pattern as their corresponding gastric profiles, albeit with lower percentages of ethanol. Median duodenal ethanol Cmax (min-max) for beer, wine and whisky are 1.97% (0.89-4.3), 2.39% (2.02-5.63) and 5.94% (3.55-17.71), respectively. Intraluminal ethanol concentrations appear to decline relatively rapidly in fasting conditions: both stomach and duodenum contained less than 0.05% of ethanol after 120 min. CONCLUSIONS This in vivo study is the first to present intraluminal ethanol concentrations in man after the intake of alcoholic beverages. Relatively low and fast declining gastric ethanol concentrations were observed, contrasting with the current Food and Drug Administration guidelines for the in vitro testing of formulations with respect to ethanol resistance. The presented gastric and duodenal ethanol concentrations and their variation may serve as reference data to design relevant models for predicting (i) ethanol resistance of drug formulations and (ii) ethanol effects on drug solubility and permeability.","Rubbens, Jari; Brouwers, Joachim; Wolfs, Kris; Adams, Erwin; Tack, Jan; Augustijns, Patrick",European journal of pharmaceutical sciences : official journal of the European Federation for Pharmaceutical Sciences,707,16

F. in 1936 for the first time. Almost 70 years later, it is considered one of the molecules most likely to be developed into modern drugs, as it exhibits notable bioactivity, including anticancer and anti-inflammatory activity, and exerts antiobesity effects. In addition, the molecular mechanisms underlying its bioactivity are being widely studied, which offers new avenues for its development as a pharmaceutical reagent. Owing to its potential therapeutic effects and unique chemical structure, celastrol has attracted considerable interest in the fields of organic, biosynthesis, and medicinal chemistry. As several steps in the biosynthesis of celastrol have been revealed, the mechanisms of key enzymes catalyzing the formation and postmodifications of the celastrol scaffold have been gradually elucidated, which lays a good foundation for the future heterogeneous biosynthesis of celastrol. Chemical synthesis is also an effective approach to obtain celastrol. The total synthesis of celastrol was realized for the first time in 2015, which established a new strategy to obtain celastroid natural products. However, owing to the toxic effects and suboptimal pharmacological properties of celastrol, its clinical applications remain limited. To search for drug-like derivatives, several structurally modified compounds were synthesized and tested. This review focuses primarily on the latest research progress in the biosynthesis, total synthesis, structural modifications, bioactivity, and mechanism of action of celastrol. We anticipate that this paper will facilitate a more comprehensive understanding of this promising compound and provide constructive references for future research in this field.","Lu, Yun; Liu, Yuan; Zhou, Jiawei; Li, Dan; Gao, Wei",Medicinal research reviews,707,1

Clinical manifestations post-COVID syndrome vary greatly, but the most common symptoms include fatigue, anxiety and depression disorders (ADDs), and cognitive impairment (CI). Objective: to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Cholytilin (choline alfoscerate) and the combined drug MexiB 6 in patients with post-COVID syndrome and fatigue, ADDs, and CI. Patients and methods. The study included 100 patients aged 22 to 71 years who have had COVID-19 5.4 months ago. Inclusion criterion: cognitive complaints, fatigue, and emotional disturbances. The evaluation included neurological exam, Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MoCA), Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), 10-words list task, Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Study participants were divided into two groups. Patients who had ADDs (anxiety/depression level according to HADS ≥8 points;n=50) were prescribed with MexiB 6 (1 tablet three times per day). Patients with CI (mean MoCA score ≤25 points;n=50) were prescribed with Cholytilin (2 capsules (800 mg) in the morning and 1 capsule (400 mg) at lunchtime). The follow-up period was 60 days. Results and discussion. According to MoCA scores, a decrease in cognition was observed in 58% of participants, while 28% did not notice CI earlier. ADD fere present in 51%, and fatigue – in 100% of patients. We observed a significant reduction in fatigue severity (from 62.42±7.18 to 52.32±16.36 points;p<0.05) in patients prescribed with MexiB 6. The majority of patients noted a significant increase in physical activity, decreased fatigue, improvement of attention and physical well-being, and increased workplace efficiency. We also found a significant decrease in ADDs severity: ADDs either regressed completely (in 42% of participants) or became subclinical (in 48%;р<0.001). CI severity also reduced according to mean МоСА (from 26.60±1.31 to 27.28±1.39 points;p<0.05) and FAB (from 16.98±1.06 to 17.20±0.90 points;p<0.05) scores. In a subgroup of patients with mild CI treated with Cholytilin mean МоСА (from 23.50±0.99 to 26.36±1.34;р<0.001) and FAB (from 16.02±0.91 to 16.96±0.99;р<0.001) scores significantly increased. Complete regression of CI was observed in 74% of participants (р<0.001). We also found a decrease in ADDs (р<0.001) and fatigue (mean MFI-20 scores decreased from 42.28±10.73 to 35.60±8.10;р<0.001) severity in all study participants. Conclusion. Patients who have had COVID-19, regardless of the disease severity, have a high prevalence of fatigue, ADDs and CI, and MexiB 6 and Cholytilin have a potential in their treatment.","Bogolepova, A.

Direct estimates of its potential to enhance transmission are limited. MethodsNose and throat swabs from 28-September-2020 to 2-January-2021 in the UKs nationally representative surveillance study were tested by RT-PCR for three genes (N, S and ORF1ab). Those positive only on ORF1ab+N, S-gene target failures (SGTF), are compatible with B.1.1.7/VOC202012/01. We investigated cycle threshold (Ct) values (a proxy for viral load), percentage of positives, population positivity and growth rates in SGTF vs non-SGTF positives. Results15,166(0.98%) of 1,553,687 swabs were PCR-positive, 8,545(56%) with three genes detected and 3,531(23%) SGTF. SGTF comprised an increasing, and triple-gene positives a decreasing, percentage of infections from late-November in most UK regions/countries, e.g. from 15% to 38% to 81% over 1.5 months in London. SGTF Ct values correspondingly declined substantially to similar levels to triple-gene positives. Population-level SGTF positivity remained low (<0.25%) in all regions/countries until late-November, when marked increases with and without self-reported symptoms occurred in southern England (to 1.5-3%), despite stable rates of non-SGTF cases. SGTF positivity rates increased on average 6% more rapidly than rates of non-SGTF positives (95% CI 4-9%) supporting addition rather than replacement with B.1.1.7/VOC202012/01. Excess growth rates for SGTF vs non-SGTF positives were similar in those up to high school age (5% (1-8%)) and older individuals (6% (4-9%)). ConclusionsDirect population-representative estimates show that the B.1.1.7/VOC202012/01 SARS-CoV-2 variant leads to higher infection rates, but does not seem particularly adapted to any age group.","Walker, Ann Sarah; Vihta, Karina Doris; Gethings, Owen; Pritchard, Emma; Jones, Joel; House, Thomas; Bell, Iain; Bell, John; Newton, John; Farrar, Jeremy; Diamond, Ian; Studley, Ruth; Rourke, Emma; Hay, Jodie; Hopkins, Susan; Crook, Derrick W; Peto, Tim; Matthews, Philippa; Eyre, David W; Stoesser, Nicole W; Pouwels, Koen; team, - the COVID-19 Infection Survey",,707,16

Additionally, the precise components involved in this activity are not known. Therefore, in this study, a method was developed to quantitatively measure the antimicrobial activity of the components found on the surface of hands, which was then compared with the medical history of the participants for infectious diseases. As a result, the antimicrobial activity of the surface of the hands was found to be positively associated with the history of infection in individuals. Furthermore, a comprehensive analysis of the components on the surface of hands indicated that organic acids and antimicrobial peptides are highly correlated with antimicrobial activity. The high amounts of lactic acid found on the surface of hands suggested it is an important factor in the hand surface infection barrier. Here we showed that the application of lactic acid within the range of the amounts present on the hand surface was found to significantly improve the antimicrobial activity of the hands. Taken together, these results demonstrate that this new method can be used to quantify antimicrobial activity, which opens new avenues for the development of hand hygiene practices by enhancing the antimicrobial activity on the surface of hands using natural ingredients against pathogens.","Nishioka, Y.; Nagano, K.; Koga, Y.; Okada, Y.; Mori, I.; Hayase, A.; Mori, T.; Manabe, K.",,707,11

Methods: All persons with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR result from a combined nasopharyngeal (NP) and oropharyngeal (OP) swab (first samples from unique persons only) that was collected between March 17, 2020, and March 31, 2021, in Public Health testing facilities in the region Kennemerland, province of North Holland, the Netherlands were included. Data on hospital (and ICU) admission were collected from the two large teaching hospitals in the region Kennemerland. Results: In total, 20,207 SARS-CoV-2 positive persons were included in this study, of whom 310 (1.5%) were hospitalized in a regional hospital within 30 days of their positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test. When persons were categorized in three SARS-CoV-2 viral load groups, the high viral load group (Cp < 25) was associated with an increased risk of hospitalization as compared to the low viral load group (Cp > 30) (ORadjusted [95%CI]: 1.57 [1.11-2.26], p-value=0.012), adjusted for age and sex. The same association was seen for ICU admission (ORadjusted [95%CI]: 7.06 [2.15-43.57], p-value=0.007). For a subset of 243 of the 310 hospitalized patients, the association of initial SARS-CoV-2 Cp-value with in-hospital mortality was analyzed. The initial SARS-CoV-2 Cp-value of the 17 patients who deceased in the hospital was significantly lower (indicating a higher viral load) compared to the 226 survivors: median Cp-value [IQR]: 22.7 [3.4] vs. 25.0 [5.2], OR[95%CI]: 0.81 [0.68-0.94], p-value = 0.010. Conclusions: Our data show that higher initial SARS-CoV-2 viral load is associated with an increased risk of hospital admission, ICU admission, and in-hospital mortality. We believe that our findings emphasize the added value of reporting SARS-CoV-2 viral load based on Cp-values to identify persons who are at the highest risk of adverse outcomes such as hospital or ICU admission and who therefore may benefit from more intensive monitoring.","Souverein, D.; van Stralen, K.; van Lelyveld, S.; van Gemeren, C.; Haverkort, M.; Snijders, D.; Soetekouw, R.; Kapteijns, E.; de Jong, E.; Hermanides, G.; Aronson, S.; Wagemakers, A.; Euser, S.",,707,1

However, there are evidences of a very high proportion of asymptomatic patients. In this situation, in order to estimate the real number of infected (and to estimate the lethality rate), it should be necessary to run a properly designed sample survey through which it would be possible to calculate the probability of inclusion and hence draw sound probabilistic inference. Unfortunately, the survey run by the Italian Statistical Institute encountered many field difficulties. Some researchers proposed estimates of the total prevalence based on various approaches, including epidemiologic models, time series and the analysis of data collected in countries that faced the epidemic in earlier times. In this paper, we propose to estimate the prevalence of Covid-19 in Italy by reweighting the available official data published by the Istituto Superiore di Sanità so as to obtain a more representative sample of the Italian population. Reweighting is a procedure commonly used to artificially modify the sample composition so as to obtain a distribution which is more similar to the population. In this paper, we will use post-stratification of the official data, in order to derive the weights necessary for reweighting the sample results, using age and gender as post-stratification variables, thus obtaining more reliable estimation of prevalence and lethality. Specifically, for Italy, we obtain a prevalence of 9%. The proposed methodology represents a reasonable approximation while waiting for more reliable data obtained with a properly designed national sample survey and that it could be further improved if more data were made available.","Bassi, F; Arbia, G; Falorsi, P D",Sci Total Environ,707,1

For eleven of these elements (the stems in SL1-8, reverse complement of SL1-4, FSE, s2m and 3' UTR pseudoknot), modeling convergence supports the accuracy of predicted low energy states; subsequent cryo-EM characterization of the FSE confirms modeling accuracy. To aid efforts to discover small molecule RNA binders guided by computational models, we provide a second set of similarly prepared models for RNA riboswitches that bind small molecules. Both datasets ('FARFAR2-SARS-CoV-2', https://github.com/DasLab/FARFAR2-SARS-CoV-2; and 'FARFAR2-Apo-Riboswitch', at https://github.com/DasLab/FARFAR2-Apo-Riboswitch') include up to 400 models for each RNA element, which may facilitate drug discovery approaches targeting dynamic ensembles of RNA molecules.","Rangan, Ramya; Watkins, Andrew M; Chacon, Jose; Kretsch, Rachael; Kladwang, Wipapat; Zheludev, Ivan N; Townley, Jill; Rynge, Mats; Thain, Gregory; Das, Rhiju",Nucleic Acids Res,707,24

Audiences include: business, clinical, public health, education, community, and state/local government. The swift, severe, and global nature of COVID-19 offers an opportunity to systematically obtain a national view of how larger institutions of higher education adopted NPI guidance at the onset of the pandemic. METHOD: An original database of COVID-19-related university NPI policy changes was compiled. Survey team members manually combed university websites and official statements capturing implementation decisions and dates for five NPI variables from 575 U.S. universities, across 50 states and the District of Columbia, during March of 2020. The universities included in this study were selected from the Department of Education Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), which provides a set of university explanatory variables. Using IPEDS as the basis for the organizational data allows consistent mapping to event-time and institutional characteristic variables including public health announcements, geospatial, census, and political affiliation. RESULTS: The dataset enables event-time analysis and offers a variety of variables to support institutional level study and identification of underlying biases like educational attainment. A descriptive analysis of the dataset reveals that there was substantial heterogeneity in the decisions that were made and the timing of these decisions as they temporally related to key state, national, and global emergency announcements. The WHO pandemic declaration coincided with the largest number of university decisions to implement NPIs. CONCLUSION: This study provides descriptive observations and produced an original dataset that will be useful for future research focused on drivers and trends of COVID-19 NPIs for U.S. Universities. This preliminary analysis suggests COVID-19 university decisions appeared to be made largely at the university level, leading to major variations in the nature and timing of the responses both between and within states, which requires further study.","Cevasco, Kevin E; North, Hayley M; Zeitoun, Sheryne A; Wofford, Rachel N; Matulis, Graham A; Gregory, Abigail F; Hassan, Maha H; Abdo, Aya D; Farris, David; Roess, Amira A; von Fricken, Michael E",PLoS One,707,24

There are few data, however, on the risk of acquiring COVID-19 in US hospitals. Objective: To assess the incidence of COVID-19 among patients hospitalized at a large US academic medical center in the 12 weeks after the first inpatient case was identified. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study included all patients admitted to Brigham and Women's Hospital (Boston, Massachusetts) between March 7 and May 30, 2020. Follow-up occurred through June 17, 2020. Medical records for all patients who first tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on hospital day 3 or later or within 14 days of discharge were reviewed. Exposures: A comprehensive infection control program was implemented that included dedicated COVID-19 units with airborne infection isolation rooms, personal protective equipment in accordance with US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations, personal protective equipment donning and doffing monitors, universal masking, restriction of visitors, and liberal RT-PCR testing of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Main Outcomes and Measures: Whether infection was community or hospital acquired based on timing of tests, clinical course, and exposures. Results: Over the 12-week period, 9149 patients (mean [SD] age, 46.1 [26.4] years; median [IQR] age, 51 years [30-67 years]; 5243 female [57.3%]) were admitted to the hospital, for whom 7394 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests were performed; 697 COVID-19 cases were confirmed, translating into 8656 days of COVID-19-related care. Twelve of the 697 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (1.7%) first tested positive on hospital day 3 or later (median, 4 days; range, 3-15 days). Of these, only 1 case was deemed to be hospital acquired, most likely from a presymptomatic spouse who was visiting daily and diagnosed with COVID-19 before visitor restrictions and masking were implemented. Among 8370 patients with non-COVID-19-related hospitalizations discharged through June 17, 11 (0.1%) tested positive within 14 days (median time to diagnosis, 6 days; range, 1-14 days). Only 1 case was deemed likely to be hospital acquired, albeit with no known exposures. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study of patients in a large academic medical center with rigorous infection control measures, nosocomial COVID-19 was rare during the height of the pandemic in the region. These findings may inform practices in other institutions and provide reassurance to patients concerned about contracting COVID-19 in hospitals.","Rhee, Chanu; Baker, Meghan; Vaidya, Vineeta; Tucker, Robert; Resnick, Andrew; Morris, Charles A; Klompas, Michael",JAMA Netw Open,707,16

We investigated the physiological origins of this clinical observation linking diabetes with severity and adverse outcome of COVID-19. METHODS: Publication mining was applied to reveal common physiological contexts in which diabetes and COVID-19 have been investigated simultaneously. Overall, we have acquired 1,121,078 publications from PubMed in the time span between 01-01-2000 and 17-04-2020, and extracted knowledge graphs interconnecting the topics related to diabetes and COVID-19. RESULTS: The Data Mining revealed three pathophysiological pathways linking diabetes and COVID-19. The first pathway indicates a higher risk for COVID-19 because of a dysregulation of Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. The other two important physiological links between diabetes and COVID-19 are liver dysfunction and chronic systemic inflammation. A deep network analysis has suggested clinical biomarkers predicting the higher risk: Hypertension, elevated serum Alanine aminotransferase, high Interleukin-6, and low Lymphocytes count. CONCLUSIONS: The revealed biomarkers can be applied directly in clinical practice. For newly infected patients, the medical history needs to be checked for evidence of a long-term, chronic dysregulation of these biomarkers. In particular, patients with diabetes, but also those with prediabetic state, deserve special attention.","Marhl, Marko; Grubelnik, Vladimir; Magdic, Marsa; Markovic, Rene",Diabetes Metab Syndr,707,16

In the West, even with peri-operative chemotherapy, 5-year survival rate is approximately 40%. GC is a heterogeneous disease, well-characterized by different molecular classifications, all having in common the role of the immune system and a T-cell inflamed phenotype across all subtypes. The anti-PD-L1 avelumab (Av) antibody has demonstrated efficacy in GC with response rates of around 10% in the refractory setting. The addition of other immune checkpoint inhibitors to chemotherapy has demonstrated efficacy in the metastatic setting. The combination of Av to perioperative chemotherapy may increase pathological responses by a synergistic effect, and then improving the survival (OS). Trial design: MONEO is an open-label, non-randomized, multicentric, phase II study that explores the combination of Av plus peri-operative FLOT (docetaxel, oxaliplatin, fluorouracil/leucovorin) in resectable GC pts. EudraCT 2019-000782-21;ClinicalTrials NCT03979131. Main inclusion criteria require pts with histologically proven GC, stage Ib (T1N1 only) - IIIC (7th AJCC Ed), available paraffin block from diagnosis and surgery, evaluable disease (RECIST 1.1) amenable to radical surgery. Significant comorbidities and active autoimmune diseases are excluded. Treatment consists of surgery with 4 peri-operatory cycles of FLOT + Av, followed by Av up to one year. The primary objective is the pathological complete response (pCR) rate, compared to historical data. Secondary objectives include OS, disease-free survival, R0 resection rate, tolerability and biomarker analysis. Key point is the comprehensive biomarker analysis from tissue and blood samples (pathological immune response, TCR clonality, immune contexture characterization, immunodynamic monitoring).

Similarly to what is happening in other countries, an important reduction in available operating rooms is affecting our departments. In this study, we aim to know how Covid-19 pandemic is affecting the delivery of plastic surgery services in Spain. Methods: A questionnaire addressing some of our concerns about how the Coronavirus crisis might severelyimpact our specialty has been sent to the heads of the divisions of plastic surgery of several hospitals across Spain. Results: A total of 12 plastic surgery departments from different hospitals across the country agreed to participate in the survey. Most plastic surgery teams will need to maintain 50-80% of their staff in order to be able to offer emergency and undelayable oncological procedures. The total amount of procedures currently being performed ranged from 0 to 44% of the figures before the coronavirus outbreak, except for one department, with elective surgery mainly affected. Microsurgical cases have been massively discontinued during this crisis. Conclusions: Plastic surgery delivery in the Spanish Health System is being severely impacted as a collateral damage from this pandemic. Most of the elective surgery is currently stopped.

We described the clinical features and prognosis of confirmed COVID-19 patients with MS during hospitalization and after discharge. METHODS: Two hundred and thirty-three COVID-19 patients from the hospitals in 8 cities of Jiangsu, China were retrospectively included. Clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients were described and risk factors of severe illness were analyzed by logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Forty-five (19.3%) of 233 COVID-19 patients had MS. The median age of COVID-19 patients with MS was significantly higher than non-MS patients (53.0 years vs. 46.0 years, P=0.004). There were no significant differences of clinical symptoms, abnormal chest CT images, and treatment drugs between two groups. More patients with MS had severe illness (33.3% vs. 6.4%, P<0.001) and critical illness (4.4% vs. 0.5%, P=0.037) than non-MS patients. The proportions of respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome in MS patients were also higher than non-MS patients during hospitalization. Multivariate analysis showed that concurrent MS (odds ratio [OR] 7.668, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.062-19.201, P<0.001) and lymphopenia (OR 3.315, 95% CI 1.306-8.411, P=0.012) were independent risk factors of severe illness of COVID-19. At a median follow-up of 28 days after discharge, bilateral pneumonia was found in 95.2% of MS patients, while only 54.7% of non-MS patients presented bilateral pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: 19.3% of COVID-19 patients had MS in our study. COVID-19 patients with MS are more likely to develop severe complications and have worse prognosis.

National policies on labour welfare and rights are reviewed through the case studies used as a lens to explore wider issues associated with forced child labour in supply chains. The study highlights the evolution of organised crime in India with regards to the reliance on forced child labour, using the four conceptual dimensions of modern slavery established by the UK Home Office in 2017.

The present study examines how students adapted to learning online in these unprecedented circumstances. We aimed to explore the relationship between adaptability, academic emotion, and student engagement during COVID-19. 1,119 university students from 20 provinces participated in this longitudinal study (2 time points with a 2-week interval). The results showed that adaptability (the ability to respond to changes) and student engagement are significantly positively correlated with positive academic emotion and negatively correlated with negative academic emotion. Furthermore, adaptability not only directly predicts student engagement, but also affects student engagement through the chain mediation of positive academic emotion and negative academic emotion. The results contribute to the gap in knowledge regarding changes in students’ learning in response to the outbreak. This study further explains the internal mechanisms mediating the relationship between adaptability and student engagement. It may provide references for educational researchers and universities in dampening the negative effects of COVID-19 on students’ learning by improving their adaptability and developing positive academic emotions.","Zhang, Keshun; Wu, Shizhen; Xu, Yanling; Cao, Wanjun; Goetz, Thomas; Parks-Stamm, Elizabeth J.",Front Psychol,707,16
