313,313,313,Antiviral Activity of Some Plants Used in Nepalese Traditional Medicine,13.790718,9.725235,2007-10-25,"Methanolic extracts of 41 plant species belonging to 27 families used in the traditional medicine in Nepal have been investigated for in vitro antiviral activity against Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and influenza virus A by dye uptake assay in the systems HSV-1/Vero cells and influenza virus A/MDCK cells. The extracts of Astilbe rivularis, Bergenia ciliata, Cassiope fastigiata and Thymus linearis showed potent anti-herpes viral activity. The extracts of Allium oreoprasum, Androsace strigilosa, Asparagus filicinus, Astilbe rivularis, Bergenia ciliata and Verbascum thapsus exhibited strong anti-influenza viral activity. Only the extracts of A. rivularis and B. ciliata demonstrated remarkable activity against both viruses.","Rajbhandari, M.; Mentel, R.; Jha, P. K.; Chaudhary, R. P.; Bhattarai, S.; Gewali, M.

In this case report, the authors describe a thirty-five year old immunocompetent male presenting with severe respiratory distress requiring intubation. On further work up, a CT thorax showed features consistent with necrotizing pneumonia. The morphology and sensitivity pattern of the organism found in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and blood culture were consistent with MRSA. The patient's stay in the hospital was complicated by acute renal failure due to rhabdomyolysis with CPK levels of 9995 U/L. The patient was started on dialysis and improved there after. This case brings to light that CA-MRSA is becoming a problem in developing nations where antibiotics are frequently used empirically with little laboratory guidance. It also is a rare reporting of rhabdomyolysis due to CA-MRSA.","Goundan, Poorani Nallam; Mehrotra, Anurag; Mani, Deepa; Varadarajan, Indumathy",Cases J,148,0
425,425,425,Development of a Symptom Score for Clinical Studies to Identify Children With a Documented Viral Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,13.816881,9.650261,2010,"The objective of this study was to develop a symptom scoring system for use in clinical studies that differentiates children with cold symptoms who have an identifiable viral etiology for their upper respiratory tract infection (URI) from those in whom no virus is detected. Nasal swabs for PCR testing for identification of respiratory viruses were obtained on children aged 2–11 y at baseline and when parents thought their child was developing a cold. Parental-recorded severity of specific symptoms in children with and without a documented viral URI were compared. Nasal swabs were obtained on 108 children whose parents reported their child was developing a cold. A viral etiology was identified in 62 of 108 (57.4%) samples. Symptom measures that best differentiated children with a viral etiology from those without were significant runny nose and significant cough on days 1–4 of the illness. A URI symptom score was developed based on these symptoms, with a sensitivity of 81.4%, specificity of 61.9%, and accuracy of 73.3%. Parental impression is only a moderately accurate predictor of viral URI in children. Our URI symptom score provided a more accurate method for identifying children with viral URIs for clinical studies.","Taylor, James A; Weber, Wendy J; Martin, Emily T; McCarty, Rachelle L; Englund, Janet A",Pediatr Res,148,1

Rotaviruses (RVs) are a major cause of diarrhoea among infants, young children, immunocompromised people, and domesticated animals. Our work is first to determine anti-RV activity of marama bean and tuber ethanol and water extracts; in this case on intestinal enterocyte cells of human infant (H4), adult pig (CLAB) and adult bovine (CIEB) origin. Marama cotyledon ethanolic extract (MCE) and cotyledon water extract (MCW) without RV were not cytotoxic to all cells tested, while seed coat and tuber extracts showed variable levels of cytotoxicity. Marama cotyledon ethanolic and water extracts (MCE and MCW, resp.) (≥0.1 mg/mL), seed coat extract (MSCE) and seed coat water extract (MSCW) (0.01 to 0.001 mg/mL), especially ethanolic, significantly increased cell survival and enhanced survival to cytopathic effects of RV by at least 100% after in vitro co- and pre-incubation treatments. All marama extracts used significantly enhanced nitric oxide release from H4 cells and enhanced TER (Ω/cm(2)) of enterocyte barriers after coincubation with RV. Marama cotyledon and seed coat extracts inhibited virion infectivity possibly through interference with replication due to accumulation of nitric oxide. Marama extracts are therefore promising microbicides against RV.","Chingwaru, Walter; Majinda, Runner T.; Yeboah, Sam O.; Jackson, Jose C.; Kapewangolo, Petrina T.; Kandawa-Schulz, Martha; Cencic, Avrelija",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,148,22

The Fas/FasL system is a receptor ligand system that has dual pro-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory functions and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of lung injury. In this study we test the hypothesis that a functioning Fas/FasL system is required for the development of lung injury in mechanically ventilated mice. METHODS: C57BL/6 (B6) and Fas-deficient lpr mice were exposed to either intra-tracheal PBS followed by spontaneous breathing or intra-tracheal LPS followed by four hours mechanical ventilation with tidal volumes of 10 mL/kg, respiratory rate of 150 breaths per minute, inspired oxygen 0.21 and positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 3 cm of water. RESULTS: Compared with the B6 mice, the lpr mice showed attenuation of the neutrophilic response as measured by decreased numbers of BAL neutrophils and lung myeloperoxidase activity. Interestingly, the B6 and lpr mice had similar concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including CXCL1 (KC), and similar measurements of permeability and apoptosis. However, the B6 mice showed greater deposition of anti-KC:KC immune complexes in the lungs, as compared with the lpr mice. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that a functioning Fas/FasL system is required for full neutrophilic response to LPS in mechanically ventilated mice.","Gil, Sucheol; Farnand, Alex W; Altemeier, William A; Gill, Sean E; Kurdowska, Anna; Krupa, Agnieszka; Florence, Jon M; Matute-Bello, Gustavo",Respir Res,148,1

To our knowledge, no previous study has reported the existence of bocavirus in Saudi Arabia. Swabs samples from 80 children with respiratory tract infections were examined for the presence of HBoV. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used as a sensitive method to detect the HBoV. Direct gene sequencing was used to determine the genotype of the detected virus isolates. HBoV was detected in 22.5% of the examined patients. The NP1 partial gene sequence from all patients showed that the circulated strains were related to HBoV-1 genotype. Most of HBoV infected patients showed evidence of mixed coinfection with other viral pathogens. The current study clearly demonstrated that genetically conserved HBoV1 circulates in Saudi Arabia. Interestingly, most of the HBoV1 infected cases were associated with high rates of co-infections with other viruses.","Abdel-Moneim, Ahmed S.; Kamel, Mahmoud M.; Al-Ghamdi, Abdullhamid S.; Al-Malky, Mater I.

The objective was to compare characteristics of hospitalized pH1N1 patients with and without asthma and assess factors associated with severity among asthma patients. METHODS: Patient data were derived from two 2009 pandemic case-series of U.S. pH1N1 hospitalizations. A case was defined as a person ≥ 2 years old hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed pH1N1. Asthma status was determined through chart review. RESULTS: Among 473 cases, 29% had asthma. Persons with asthma were more likely to be 2–17 years old (39% vs. 30%, p = 0.04) and black (29% vs. 18%, p < 0.01), and have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (13% vs. 9%, p = 0.04) but less likely to have pneumonia (37% vs. 47%, p = 0.05), need mechanical ventilation (13% vs. 23%, p = 0.02), and die (4% vs. 10%, p = 0.04) than those without asthma. Among patients with asthma, those admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) or who died (n = 38) compared with survivors not admitted to an ICU (n = 99) were more likely to have pneumonia on admission (60% vs. 27%, p < 0.01) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (24% vs. 0%, p < 0.01) and less likely to receive influenza antiviral agents ≤ 2 days of admission (73% vs. 92%, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of persons with asthma had an uncomplicated course; however, severe disease, including ICU admission and death, occurred in asthma patients who presented with pneumonia. Influenza antiviral agents should be started early in hospitalized patients with suspected influenza, including those with asthma.","Bramley, Anna M; Skarbinski, Jacek; Fry, Alicia M; Finelli, Lyn; Jain, Seema",BMC Infect Dis,148,3
1100,1100,1100,Saikosaponin-d Enhances the Anticancer Potency of TNF-α via Overcoming Its Undesirable Response of Activating NF-Kappa B Signalling in Cancer Cells,13.556034,9.764957,2013-03-12,"Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) was reported as anticancer therapy due to its cytotoxic effect against an array of tumor cells. However, its undesirable responses of TNF-α on activating NF-κB signaling and pro-metastatic property limit its clinical application in treating cancers. Therefore, sensitizing agents capable of overcoming this undesirable effect must be valuable for facilitating the usage of TNF-α-mediated apoptosis therapy for cancer patients. Previously, saikosaponin-d (Ssd), a triterpene saponin derived from the medicinal plant, Bupleurum falcatum L. (Umbelliferae), showed to exhibit a variety of pharmacological activities such as antiinflammation, antibacteria, antivirus and anticancer. Recently, we found that Ssd could inhibit the activated T lymphocytes via suppression of NF-κB, NF-AT and AP-1 signaling. Here, we showed that Ssd significantly potentiated TNF-α-mediated cell death in HeLa and HepG2 cancer cells via suppression of TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation and its target genes expression involving cancer cell proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis and survival. Also, Ssd revealed a significant potency of abolishing TNF-α-induced cancer cell invasion and angiogenesis in HUVECs while inducing apoptosis via enhancing the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in HeLa cells. Collectively, these findings indicate that Ssd has a significant potential to be developed as a combined adjuvant remedy with TNF-α for cancer patients.","Wong, Vincent Kam Wai; Zhang, Molly Miao; Zhou, Hua; Lam, Kelly Yin Ching; Chan, Po Ling; Law, Carmen Ka Man; Yue, Patrick Ying Kit; Liu, Liang",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,148,22
1144,1144,1144,Carriage of Mycoplasma pneumoniae in the Upper Respiratory Tract of Symptomatic and Asymptomatic Children: An Observational Study,13.552591,9.368459,2013-05-14,"BACKGROUND: Mycoplasma pneumoniae is thought to be a common cause of respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in children. The diagnosis of M. pneumoniae RTIs currently relies on serological methods and/or the detection of bacterial DNA in the upper respiratory tract (URT). It is conceivable, however, that these diagnostic methods also yield positive results if M. pneumoniae is carried asymptomatically in the URT. Positive results from these tests may therefore not always be indicative of a symptomatic infection. The existence of asymptomatic carriage of M. pneumoniae has not been established. We hypothesized that asymptomatic carriage in children exists and investigated whether colonization and symptomatic infection could be differentiated by current diagnostic methods. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This study was conducted at the Erasmus MC–Sophia Children's Hospital and the after-hours General Practitioners Cooperative in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Asymptomatic children (n = 405) and children with RTI symptoms (n = 321) aged 3 mo to 16 y were enrolled in a cross-sectional study from July 1, 2008, to November 30, 2011. Clinical data, pharyngeal and nasopharyngeal specimens, and serum samples were collected. The primary objective was to differentiate between colonization and symptomatic infection with M. pneumoniae by current diagnostic methods, especially real-time PCR. M. pneumoniae DNA was detected in 21.2% (95% CI 17.2%–25.2%) of the asymptomatic children and in 16.2% (95% CI 12.2%–20.2%) of the symptomatic children (p = 0.11). Neither serology nor quantitative PCR nor culture differentiated asymptomatic carriage from infection. A total of 202 children were tested for the presence of other bacterial and viral pathogens. Two or more pathogens were found in 56% (63/112) of the asymptomatic children and in 55.5% (50/90) of the symptomatic children. Finally, longitudinal sampling showed persistence of M. pneumoniae in the URT for up to 4 mo. Fifteen of the 21 asymptomatic children with M. pneumoniae and 19 of the 22 symptomatic children with M. pneumoniae in this longitudinal follow-up tested negative after 1 mo. CONCLUSIONS: Although our study has limitations, such as a single study site and limited sample size, our data indicate that the presence of M. pneumoniae in the URT is common in asymptomatic children. The current diagnostic tests for M. pneumoniae are unable to differentiate between asymptomatic carriage and symptomatic infection.

The purposes of this study were to detect respiratory viruses in hospitalized children younger than six years and identify the influence of temperature and relative air humidity on the detected viruses. Samples of nasopharyngeal washes were collected from hospitalized children between May/2004 and September/2005. Methods of viral detection were RT-PCR, PCR and HRV amplicons were confirmed by hybridization. Results showed 54% (148/272) of viral positivity. HRSV was detected in 29% (79/272) of the samples; HRV in 23.1% (63/272); HPIV3 in 5.1% (14/272); HMPV in 3.3% (9/272); HPIV1 in 2.9% (8/272); FLUB in 1.4% (4/272), FLUA in 1.1% (3/272), and HPIV2 in 0.3% (1/272). The highest detection rates occurred mainly in the spring 2004 and in the autumn 2005.

1318,1318,1318,Immunosuppression of the Trimellitic Anhydride-Induced Th2 Response by Novel Nonanatural Products Mixture in Mice,13.682537,9.757553,2013-11-19,"Many natural dietary products prevent or cure allergic inflammation; however, the ability of mixtures of these natural medicinals to suppress allergic skin inflammation is unknown. We examined the inhibitory effects of nonanatural products mixture (NPM-9), which provides immunoregulatory activation, on Th2-mediated skin allergic inflammation. Oral administration of NPM-9 in mice reduced ear thickness and specific IgE production in trimellitic anhydride- (TMA-)induced contact hypersensitivity (CHS). NPM-9 also suppressed IL-4 and IL-1β production in splenocytes but prevented only TMA-induced IL-1β production in inflamed ears. To characterize the mechanism of this effect, we examined NPM-9 immunosuppression on an OVA-induced Th2 allergic state. Oral administration of NPM-9 inhibited Th2-mediated serum IgE overproduction. NPM-9 also downregulated the polarized Th2 response, whereas it upregulated Th1 response in splenocytes. These data suggest that NPM-9 may be a useful therapeutic agent for allergic inflammatory diseases through its suppression of the Th2-mediated allergic response.","Bae, Min-Jung; Shin, Hee Soon; Shon, Dong-Hwa",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,148,31

However, the mechanisms underlying the actions of GLN remain unclear, and may depend upon the route of GLN administration and the model of acute lung injury (ALI) used. The aim of this study was to investigate whether short-term GLN supplementation had an ameliorative effect on the inflammation induced by direct acid and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge in mice. METHODS: Female BALB/c mice were divided into two groups, a control group and a GLN group (4.17% GLN supplementation). After a 10-day feeding period, ALI was induced by intratracheal administration of hydrochloric acid (pH 1.0; 2 mL/kg of body weight [BW]) and LPS (5 mg/kg BW). Mice were sacrificed 3 h after ALI challenge. In this early phase of ALI, serum, lungs, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from the mice were collected for further analysis. RESULTS: The results of this study showed that ALI-challenged mice had a significant increase in myeloperoxidase activity and expression of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α in the lung compared with unchallenged mice. Compared with the control group, GLN pretreatment in ALI-challenged mice reduced the levels of receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) and IL-1β production in BALF, with a corresponding decrease in their mRNA expression. The GLN group also had markedly lower in mRNA expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and NADPH oxidase-1. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the benefit of dietary GLN may be partly contributed to an inhibitory effect on RAGE expression and pro-inflammatory cytokines production at an early stage in direct acid and LPS-induced ALI in mice.","Chuang, Yin-Ching; Shaw, Huey-Mei; Chen, Chi-Chung; Pan, He-Jia; Lai, Wei-Chih; Huang, Hui-Ling",BMC Pulm Med,148,22
1860,1860,1860,Bacterial and Respiratory Viral Interactions in the Etiology of Acute Otitis Media in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected South African Children,13.80544,9.837199,2015-06-24,"BACKGROUND: Bacteria and respiratory viruses are implicated in the pathogenesis of acute otitis media (AOM); however, data from low–middle income countries are sparse. We investigated the etiology of AOM in HIV-infected (HIV+), HIV-uninfected (HIV−) and HIV-exposed clinically asymptomatic for HIV-infection (HEU) South African children. METHODS: Children ≥3 months to <5 years of age with AOM were enrolled between May 2009 and April 2010 (NCT01031082). Middle ear fluid samples were cultured for bacteria; antibacterial susceptibility was done and serotyping undertaken for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were analyzed for respiratory viruses using immunofluorescence assay and polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Of 260 AOM episodes (HIV+:15; HIV−:182; HEU:63), bacteria were found in 54.6%, including Haemophilus influenzae (30.8%), 98.8% of which were nontypeable, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (20.4%), Staphylococcus aureus (15.8%), Moraxella catarrhalis (5.0%) and Streptococcus pyogenes (1.5%). Nonsusceptibility of Streptococcus pneumoniae to penicillin was 64.2%. Respiratory viruses were detected in 74.2% of cases. Human rhinovirus was most frequently detected (37.7%), followed by adenovirus (14.2%) and human bocavirus (11.5%) overall and irrespective of HIV status. Respiratory viruses were identified concurrently with S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis (76.9–78.8%) and Staphylococcus aureus (63.4%) cultured from middle ear fluid, as well as in 72.0% of episodes negative for any bacteria. CONCLUSION: The study suggests that respiratory viruses and pathogenic bacteria play an important role in the development of AOM in children. A similar spectrum of pathogens was observed independently of HIV status. Vaccines targeting both nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae and S. pneumoniae may have a broad impact on AOM in South Africa.","Madhi, Shabir A.; Govender, Niresha; Dayal, Kishen; Devadiga, Raghavendra; Van Dyke, Melissa K.; van Niekerk, Nadia; Cutland, Clare Louise; Adrian, Peter V.; Nunes, Marta C.",Pediatr Infect Dis J,148,3
1936,1936,1936,Clinical significance of high-dose cytarabine added to cyclophosphamide/total-body irradiation in bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation for myeloid malignancy,13.855644,9.648364,2015-09-04,"BACKGROUND: Addition of high-dose cytarabine (HDCA) to the conventional cyclophosphamide/total-body irradiation (CY/TBI) regimen significantly improved prognosis after cord blood transplantation (CBT) for adult acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The efficacy of HDCA in bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (BMT/PBSCT), however, has not yet been elucidated. FINDINGS: We conducted a cohort study to compare the prognosis of HDCA/CY/TBI (N = 435) and CY/TBI (N = 1667) in BMT/PBSCT for AML/MDS using a Japanese transplant registry database. The median age was 38 years, and 86.0 % of the patients had AML. Unrelated donors comprised 54.6 %, and 63.9 % of donors were human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched. Overall survival (OS) was not improved in the HDCA/CY/TBI group (adjusted hazard ratio (HR), 1.14; p = 0.13). Neutrophil engraftment was inferior (HR, 0.80; p < 0.01), and the incidence of hemorrhagic cystitis and thrombotic microangiopathy increased in HDCA/CY/TBI (HR, 1.47 and 1.60; p = 0.06 and 0.04, respectively), leading to significantly higher non-relapse mortality (NRM; HR, 1.48; p < 0.01). Post-transplant relapse and tumor-related mortality were not suppressed by the addition of HDCA. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated the inefficacy of HDCA/CY/TBI in BMT/PBSCT for AML/MDS.

2559,2559,2559,Improvement of Therapeutic Efficacy of Oral Immunotherapy in Combination with Regulatory T Cell-Inducer Kakkonto in a Murine Food Allergy Model,13.770556,9.789591,2017-01-20,"Oral immunotherapy (OIT) has been considered a promising approach for food allergies (FAs). However, the current OIT strategy is limited in terms of the long-term efficacy and safety. We have previously demonstrated that kakkonto, a traditional Japanese herbal medicine, suppresses the occurrence of allergic symptoms in a murine model of ovalbumin (OVA)-induced FA, which is attributed to the induction of the Foxp3(+) CD4(+) regulatory T cells. In this study, we established an OIT model using the FA mice with already established allergic symptoms and determined whether kakkonto could improve the efficacy of OIT. The OIT method consisted of initially administrating a very small amount of OVA and slowly increasing the amount. Allergic symptoms decreased in the OIT-treated FA mice. OIT significantly downregulated Th2 immune response-related gene expression in the FA mouse colon, and decreased the level of mouse mast cell protease-1, a marker of mast cell degranulation in the FA mouse plasma. Moreover, the concomitant use of kakkonto significantly enhanced the effectiveness of OIT on the allergic symptoms, and the combination therapy further suppressed the Th2 immune responses and the mast cell degranulation. In addition, OIT significantly increased the population of Foxp3(+) CD4(+) regulatory T cells in the FA mouse colon, and this population was further increased by OIT in combination with kakkonto. Furthermore, the combined therapy with kakkonto reduced the expression of RA-degrading enzyme CYP26B1 mRNA in the FA mouse colon. These findings indicated that the combination of OIT with kakkonto represents a promising approach for FA treatment.","Nagata, Yuka; Yamamoto, Takeshi; Hayashi, Michie; Hayashi, Shusaku; Kadowaki, Makoto",PLoS One,148,8

METHODS: A literature search was performed in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CBM, CNKI, VIP, and WanFang Databases. The search restrictions were patients with UC and RCTs. Studies including other treatments except Kangfuxinye with mesalamine were excluded. RESULTS: Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria. We found significant benefits of Kangfuxinye combined with mesalamine against mesalamine alone in improving response rate as well as reducing the recurrence rate and inflammation rate; meanwhile, the increase of the adverse events rate was not observed. Furthermore, the symptoms remission rate and the cure time were insignificant statistically. Additionally, GRADE results indicated that the quality of evidence regarding the above 6 outcomes was rated from very low to moderate quality. CONCLUSIONS: Although Kangfuxinye enema seems effective and safe for treating UC patients in this systematic review, Kangfuxinye enema combined with mesalamine was weakly recommended due to very low to moderate quality of available evidence by the GRADE approach.","Ren, Peng-wei; Yang, Wen-jie; Wang, Dan-dan; Shan, Jing-yan; Kang, De-ying; Hong, Qi; Wen, Shu; Zhang, Ru-wen",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,148,22

Data from these surveillance systems showed influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 circulated in West Africa later than in other regions of the continent. METHODS: We contacted 11 West African countries to collect information about their influenza surveillance systems (number of sites, type of surveillance, sampling strategy, populations sampled, case definitions used, number of specimens collected and number of specimens positive for influenza viruses) for the time period January 2010 through December 2012. RESULTS: Of the 11 countries contacted, 8 responded: Burkina Faso, Cote d’Ivoire, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Togo. Countries used standard World Health Organization (WHO) case definitions for influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) or slight variations thereof. There were 70 surveillance sites: 26 SARI and 44 ILI. Seven countries conducted SARI surveillance and collected 3114 specimens of which 209 (7%) were positive for influenza viruses. Among influenza-positive SARI patients, 132 (63%) were influenza A [68 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 64 influenza A(H3N2)] and 77 (37%) were influenza B. All eight countries conducted ILI surveillance and collected 20,375 specimens, of which 2278 (11%) were positive for influenza viruses. Among influenza-positive ILI patients, 1431 (63%) were influenza A [820 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 611 influenza A(H3N2)] and 847 (37%) were influenza B. A majority of SARI and ILI case-patients who tested positive for influenza (72% SARI and 59% ILI) were children aged 0–4 years, as were a majority of those enrolled in surveillance. The seasonality of influenza and the predominant influenza type or subtype varied by country and year. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 continued to circulate in West Africa along with influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B during 2010–2012. Although ILI surveillance systems produced a robust number of samples during the study period, more could be done to strengthen surveillance among hospitalized SARI case-patients. Surveillance systems captured young children but lacked data on adults and the elderly. More data on risk groups for severe influenza in West Africa are needed to help shape influenza prevention and clinical management policies and guidelines.

3124,3124,3124,Proteomic fingerprinting in HIV/HCV co-infection reveals serum biomarkers for the diagnosis of fibrosis staging,13.491648,9.614259,2018-04-02,"BACKGROUND: Hepatic complications of hepatitis C virus (HCV), including fibrosis and cirrhosis are accelerated in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals. Although, liver biopsy remains the gold standard for staging HCV-associated liver disease, this test can result in serious complications and is subject to sampling errors. These challenges have prompted a search for non-invasive methods for liver fibrosis staging. To this end, we compared serum proteome profiles at different stages of fibrosis in HIV/HCV co- and HCV mono-infected patients using surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS). METHODS: Sera from 83 HIV/HCV co- and 68 HCV mono-infected subjects in 4 stages of fibrosis were tested. Sera were fractionated, randomly applied to protein chip arrays (IMAC, CM10 and H50) and spectra were generated at low and high laser intensities. RESULTS: Sixteen biomarkers achieved a p value < 0.01 (ROC values > 0.75 or < 0.25) predictive of fibrosis status in co-infected individuals and 14 in mono infected subjects. Five of these candidate biomarkers contributed to both mono- and co-infected subjects. Candidate diagnostic algorithms were created to distinguish between non-fibrotic and fibrotic individuals using a panel of 4 biomarker peaks. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that SELDI MS profiling can identify diagnostic serum biomarkers for fibrosis that are both common and distinct in HIV/HCV co-infected and HCV mono-infected individuals.","Golizeh, Makan; Melendez-Pena, Carlos E.; Ward, Brian J.; Saeed, Sahar; Santamaria, Cynthia; Conway, Brian; Cooper, Curtis; Klein, Marina B.; Ndao, Momar",PLoS One,148,1
3610,3610,3610,Whole blood RNA sequencing reveals a unique transcriptomic profile in patients with ARDS following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation,13.627076,9.335693,2019-01-21,"BACKGROUND: The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by the acute onset of hypoxemia and bilateral lung infiltrates in response to an inciting event, and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are at increased risk for ARDS. We hypothesized that HSCT patients with ARDS would have a unique transcriptomic profile identifiable in peripheral blood compared to those that did not undergo HSCT. METHODS: We isolated RNA from banked peripheral blood samples from a biorepository of critically ill ICU patients. RNA-Seq was performed on 11 patients with ARDS (5 that had undergone HSCT and 6 that had not) and 12 patients with sepsis without ARDS (5 that that had undergone HCST and 7 that had not). RESULTS: We identified 687 differentially expressed genes between ARDS and ARDS-HSCT (adjusted p-value < 0.01), including IFI44L, OAS3, LY6E, and SPATS2L that had increased expression in ARDS vs. ARDS-HSCT; these genes were not differentially expressed in sepsis vs sepsis-HSCT. Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed that many differentially expressed genes were related to response to type I interferon. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal significant differences in whole blood transcriptomic profiles of patients with non-HSCT ARDS compared to ARDS-HSCT patients and point toward different immune responses underlying ARDS and ARDS-HSCT that contribute to lung injury.

Moutan Cortex (MC), the dried root cortex of Paeonia suffruticosa Andr., is widely used as a remedy for the treatment of inflammatory diseases in Asian region. However, there are few studies on the systematic identification of NF-κB inhibitors of MC. In this study, the effect of inhibiting NF-κB activation of MC was assessed at the cellular level using a tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) induced inflammatory model. Subsequently, ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole/time of flight-mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q/TOF-MS) combined with biological activity assay was established to screen and identify potential anti-inflammatory ingredients in MC. The results revealed that MC significantly inhibited the activation of NF-κB. Seven potential NF-κB inhibitors were screened from MC, including oxypaeoniflorin, paeoniflorin, galloylpaeoniflorin, benzoyloxypaeoniflorin, mudanpioside C, gallic acid, and paeonol. Among them, the NF-κB inhibitor activity of galloylpaeoniflorin, benzoyloxypaeoniflorin, and mudanpioside C is first reported here. In conclusion, the anti-inflammatory activity of MC was associated with the seven components mentioned above. And the bioactivity-integrated UPLC-Q/TOF which contains both chemical and bioactive details is suitable for screening active ingredients from natural medicines.","Lu, Yujie; Liu, Wenjuan; Zhang, Man; Deng, Yanfang; Jiang, Min; Bai, Gang",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,148,22

Content: Visual logistics help integrate and synthesize POCT and geospatial concepts. The resulting geospatial solutions presented here comprise: (1) small-world networks and regional topography; (2) space-time transformation, hubs, and asset mapping; (3) spatial and geospatial care paths™; (4) GIS-POCT; (5) isolation laboratories, diagnostics isolators, and mobile laboratories for highly infectious diseases; (6) alternate care facilities; (7) roaming POCT—airborne, ambulances, space, and wearables; (8) connected and wireless POCT outside hospitals; (9) unmanned aerial vehicles; (10) geospatial practice—demographic care unit resource scoring, geographic risk assessment, and national POCT policy and guidelines; (11) the hybrid laboratory; and (12) point-of-careology. Value: Small-world networks and their connectivity facilitate efficient and effective placement of POCT for optimal response, rescue, diagnosis, and treatment. Spatial care paths™ speed transport from primary encounters to referral centers bypassing topographic bottlenecks, process gaps, and time-consuming interruptions. Regional GISs position POCT close to where patients live to facilitate rapid triage, decrease therapeutic turnaround time, and conserve economic resources. Geospatial care paths™ encompass demographic and population access features. Timeliness creates value during acute illness, complex crises, and unexpected disasters. Isolation laboratories equipped with POCT help stop outbreaks and safely support critically ill patients with highly infectious diseases. POCT-enabled spatial grids can map sentinel cases and establish geographic limits of epidemics for ring vaccination. Impact: Geospatial solutions generate inherently optimal and logical placement of POCT conceptually, physically, and temporally as a means to improve crisis response and spatial resilience. If public health professionals, geospatial scientists, and POCT specialists join forces, new collaborative teamwork can create faster response and higher impact during disasters, complex crises, outbreaks, and epidemics, as well as more efficient primary, urgent, and emergency community care.","Kost, Gerald J.",Front Public Health,148,30

A retrospective analysis,13.633705,9.699307,2008-12-24,"MHV3 has three distinct effects in different strains of mice: strain A mice are completely resistant, most strains (including C57BL, DBA/2, BALB/c and NZB strains) die of acute hepatitis whereas in certain strains (eg. C3H and A2G) the virus produces a persistent infection with neurological symptoms. In cultures of peritoneal macrophages from susceptible strains, MHV-3 replicated freely, with giant cell formation. No replication was observed in macrophages from strain A mice. In contrast to this full susceptibility or resistance, macrophage cultures from strains of mice in which persistent infections occur showed an intermediate susceptibility, as judged by the intensity of the cytopathic effect, the presence of viral antigens in the cytoplasm and levels of viral replication. Possible ways in which the intermediate susceptibility of macrophages and persistent infections might be related are discussed.","Virelizier, J. -L.; Allison, A. C.",Arch Virol,148,1

Here, we explored roles of BER proteins in signaling transduction involving MAPK during hyperoxia. We demonstrated that ERK1/2 phosphorylation in A549 cells was increased in 95% O(2). p38 activity in A549 cells was also increased by exposure to 95% O(2). To evaluate regulatory roles of MAPK, we have transduced A549 cells and primary alveolar epithelial type II cells (AECII) to overexpress 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (hOgg1). Overexpression of hOgg1 reduced hyperoxic toxicity in A549 and AECII cells. Furthermore, protection by BER against hyperoxia appeared to involve an upregulation of ERK1/2 and downregulation of p38. These observations demonstrate, for the first time, that reduction of hyperoxic toxicity by BER proteins may be involved with MAPK activity, thereby impacting cell survival. Furthermore, our studies suggest that modulation of MAPK may be used in combination with BER proteins to counteract hyperoxic toxicity.","Kannan, S; Pang, H; Foster, D C; Rao, Z; Wu, M",Cell Death Differ,148,8

The condition is better referred to as mucosal barrier injury (MBI) since it is primarily the result of toxicity and is a complex and dynamic pathobiological process manifested not only in the mouth but also throughout the entire digestive tract. A model has been proposed for oral MBI and consists of four phases, namely inflammatory, epithelial, ulcerative and healing phases. A variety of factors are involved in causing and modulating MBI including the nature of the conditioning regimen, the elaboration of pro-inflammatory and other cytokines, translocation of the resident microflora and their products, for example, endotoxins across the mucosal barrier, exposure to antimicrobial agents and whether or not the haematopoietic stem cell graft is from a donor. Neutropenic typhlitis is the most severe gastrointestinal manifestation of MBI, but it also influences the occurrence of other major transplant-related complications including acute GVHD, veno-occlusive disease and systemic infections. The pathobiology, clinical counterparts and the means of measuring MBI are discussed together with potential approaches for prevention, amelioration and, perhaps, even cure.

Clinical features of autosomal recessive ARS deficiencies appear very diverse and without apparent logic. We searched for common clinical patterns to improve disease recognition, insight into pathophysiology, and clinical care. METHODS: Symptoms were analyzed in all patients with recessive ARS deficiencies reported in literature, supplemented with unreported patients evaluated in our hospital. RESULTS: In literature, we identified 107 patients with AARS, DARS, GARS, HARS, IARS, KARS, LARS, MARS, RARS, SARS, VARS, YARS, and QARS deficiencies. Common symptoms (defined as present in ≥4/13 ARS deficiencies) included abnormalities of the central nervous system and/or senses (13/13), failure to thrive, gastrointestinal symptoms, dysmaturity, liver disease, and facial dysmorphisms. Deep phenotyping of 5 additional patients with unreported compound heterozygous pathogenic variations in IARS, LARS, KARS, and QARS extended the common phenotype with lung disease, hypoalbuminemia, anemia, and renal tubulopathy. CONCLUSION: We propose a common clinical phenotype for recessive ARS deficiencies, resulting from insufficient aminoacylation activity to meet translational demand in specific organs or periods of life. Assuming residual ARS activity, adequate protein/amino acid supply seems essential instead of the traditional replacement of protein by glucose in patients with metabolic diseases.","Fuchs, Sabine A.; Schene, Imre F.; Kok, Gautam; Jansen, Jurriaan M.; Nikkels, Peter G.

METHODS: Kinetic analysis of the CypD/inhibitor interaction was quantitatively performed by using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and fluorescence titration (FT) techniques. IC(50) values of these inhibitors were determined by PPIase inhibition activity assays. RESULTS: All the equilibrium dissociation constants (K(D)) of the seven compounds binding to CypD were below 10 μmol/L. The IC(50) values were all consistent with the SPR and FT results. Compounds GW2, 5, 6, and 7 had high inhibition activities against Ca(2+)-dependent rat liver mitochondrial swelling and Ca(2+) uptake/release. Compound GW5 had binding selectivity for CypD over CypA. CONCLUSION: The agreement between the measured IC(50) values and the results of SPR and FT suggests that these methods are appropriate and powerful methods for identifying CypD inhibitors. The compounds we screened using these methods (GW1-7) are reasonable CypD inhibitors. Its potent ability to inhibit mitochondrial swelling and the binding selectivity of GW5 indicates that GW5 could potentially be used for inhibiting MPT pore opening.","Guo, Hong-xia; Wang, Feng; Yu, Kun-qian; Chen, Jing; Bai, Dong-lu; Chen, Kai-xian; Shen, Xu; Jiang, Hua-liang",Acta Pharmacol Sin,148,8

Since aminopeptidase A (APA)-deficient mice develop hypertension APA appears to be an essential enzyme in the control of blood pressure via degradation of AngII. The robust hypertension seen in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) is due to activation of the RAS, and an accompanying decrease in kidney APA. Changes in APA have also been measured during the activation of the RAS in the Goldblatt hypertension model and Dahl salt-sensitive (DSS) rat. The DSS rat shows an elevation in renal APA activity at the onset of hypertension suggesting a protective role against elevations in circulating AngII, followed by decreased APA activity with advancing hypertension. Changes seen in human maternal serum APA activity during preeclampsia are similar to changes measured in renal APA in the DSS rat model. APA activity is higher than during normal pregnancy at the onset of preeclampsia, and with advancing preeclampsia (severe preeclampsia) declines below that seen during normal pregnancy. Serum APA activity is also increased during hormone replacement therapy (HRT), perhaps in reaction to elevated levels of AngII. Thus, it appears important to consider the relationship among activation of the RAS, circulating levels of AngII, and the availability of APA in hypertensive disorders.","Mizutani, Shigehiko; Ishii, Masakazu; Hattori, Akira; Nomura, Seiji; Numaguchi, Yasushi; Tsujimoto, Masafumi; Kobayshi, Hiroshi; Murohara, Toyoaki; Wright, John W.",Heart Fail Rev,148,1

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three experimental groups: Sham rats, LPS-rats that were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and LPS-INS rats that were treated with OI given in drinking water 72 h before and following injection of LPS. Intestinal structural changes, enterocyte proliferation, enterocyte apoptosis, and mucosal expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) were determined 24 h after the last LPS injection. LPS-INS animals showed a significantly greater bowel and mucosal weight in jejunum and ileum, mucosal DNA and protein in jejunum and ileum, villus height in ileum, crypt depth in jejunum and ileum, cell proliferation rates in jejunum, and significantly lower apoptotic index in ileum compared to LPS- animals. LPS rats demonstrated 50% increase in TLR4 expression in jejunum compared to sham animals. Treatment with OI resulted in a three-fold increase in TLR4 expression in jejunum, compared to LPS animals. In conclusion, OI improves intestinal recovery after LPS endotoxemia in a rat.","Sukhotnik, Igor; Shehadeh, Naim; Rothem, Lilah; Lurie, Michael; Mogilner, Jorge; Shiloni, Eitan; Shamir, Raanan",Dig Dis Sci,148,8

The increasing incidence of infections caused by these viruses worldwide has necessitated focused attention to improve both diagnostic as well as treatment modalities. In this second part of a two-part review, we discuss the clinical features, diagnostic modalities, and treatment of zoonotic influenza, and provide an overview of prevention strategies. RECENT FINDINGS: Illnesses caused by novel reassortant avian influenza viruses continue to be detected and described; most recently, a human case of avian influenza A(H7N4) has been described from China. We continue to witness increasing rates of A(H7N9) infections, with the latest (fifth) wave, from late 2016 to 2017, being the largest to date. The case fatality rate for A(H7N9) and A(H5N1) infections among humans is much higher than that of seasonal influenza infections. Since the emergence of the A(H1N1) 2009 pandemic, and subsequently A(H7N9), testing and surveillance for novel influenzas have become more effective. Various newer treatment options, including peramivir, favipiravir (T-705), and DAS181, and human or murine monoclonal antibodies have been evaluated in vitro and in animal models. SUMMARY: Armed with robust diagnostic modalities, antiviral medications, vaccines, and advanced surveillance systems, we are today better prepared to face a new influenza pandemic and to limit the burden of zoonotic influenza than ever before. Sustained efforts and robust research are necessary to efficiently deal with the highly mutagenic zoonotic influenza viruses.","Mehta, K.; Goneau, L. W.; Wong, J.; L’Huillier, A. G.; Gubbay, J.

Isolated working rat hearts were subjected to global ischemia and reperfusion. Infusion of 140 μM A12 or AI before global ischemia improved cardiac function recovery; increased the activity of Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu,Zn SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px); decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) content in reperfused heart; and reduced the formation of hydroxyl radical adduct of the spin trap 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide in the myocardial effluent during early reperfusion compared with these indices in control. Anesthetized open-chest rats were subjected to the left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion and coronary reperfusion. Peptide A12 or its analog AI was injected intravenously at the onset of reperfusion at a dose of 0.35 μmol/kg. Treatment with A12 or AI significantly limited infarct size and reduced the activity of lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase MB isoenzyme in blood plasma at the end of reperfusion compared with control. These effects were accompanied by complete recovery of Cu,Zn SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px activities; and decrease in MDA content in the area at risk by the end of reperfusion. The study concluded that C-terminal fragment of native peptide apelin-12 and its synthesized analog is involved in the upregulation of cardiac antioxidant defense systems and attenuation of lipid peroxidation in myocardial I/R injury.","Pisarenko, O.

The aim of this study was to describe in-hospital outcomes of custom-made fenestrated stent grafts (CMSGs) and PMSGs for the treatment of CAAAs and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs). METHODS: In this single-center, retrospective study, all consecutives patients with CAAAs or TAAAs undergoing endovascular repair using Zenith CMSGs (Cook Medical, Bloomington, Ind) or PMSGs between January 2012 and November 2017 were included. End points were intraoperative adverse events, in-hospital mortality, postoperative complications, reinterventions, target vessel patency, and endoleaks. RESULTS: Ninety-seven patients were included (CMSGs, n = 69; PMSGs, n = 28). The PMSG group included more patients assigned to American Society of Anesthesiologists class 4 (n = 14 [50%] vs n = 16 [23%]; P = .006) and more TAAAs (n = 17 [61%] vs n = 10 [15%]; P < .0001). Intraoperative adverse events were recorded in eight (11%) patients in the CMSG group vs six (21%) patients in the PMSG group. No intraoperative death or open conversion occurred. In-hospital mortality rates were of 4% (n = 3) in the CMSG group and 14% in the PMSG group (n = 4). Chronic renal failure was an independent preoperative risk factor of postoperative death or complications (odds ratio, 4.88; 95% confidence interval, 1.65-14.43; P = .004). Rates of postoperative complications were 22% (n = 15) and 25% (n = 7) in the CMSG and PMSG groups. Spinal cord ischemia rates were 4% (n = 3) and 7% (n = 2) in the CMSG and PMSG groups. Reintervention rates were 16% (n = 11) in the CMSG group and 32% (n = 9) in the PMSG group. At discharge, target vessel patency rate in CMSGs was 98% (n = 207/210). All target vessels (n = 98) were patent in the PMSG group. Endoleaks at discharge were observed in 24% of the CMSG group (n = 16) vs 8% of the PMSG group (n = 2). CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed clinically relevant differences of several important in-hospital outcomes in the CMSG and PMSG groups. Larger cohorts and longer follow-up are needed to allow direct comparison. PMSGs may offer acceptable in-hospital results in patients requiring urgent interventions when CMSGs are not available or possible.","Sénémaud, Jean Nicolas; Ben Abdallah, Iannis; de Boissieu, Paul; Touma, Joseph; Kobeiter, Hicham; Desgranges, Pascal; Becquemin, Jean-Pierre; Cochennec, Frédéric",J Vasc Surg,148,1

Other viruses, using similar mechanisms, are mentioned only briefly and tangentially. Retroviruses are a unique class of viruses that have been found in all classes of vertebrates but not in other organisms. Perhaps, their most distinctive properties are the flow of information from RNA to DNA early in the infectious process, and the subsequent integration of the viral DNA into the chromosomal DNA of the host cell. Retroviruses are the causative agents of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and of a variety of neoplastic diseases in man and domestic animals. Elements with striking similarities to retroviruses, termed retrotransposons, occur in yeast and many other eukaryotes; elements sharing some characteristics with retroviruses have also recently been observed in prokaryotes. Because of the apparent relationship between retroviruses and retrotransposons, this chapter discusses of retrotransposons as well as retroviruses. Though all retroviruses utilize translational suppression in pol-protein synthesis, different groups of retroviruses use two completely distinct types of translational suppression. One of these is in-frame or readthrough suppression and the other is ribosomal frameshifting.","Hatfield, Dolph L.; Levin, Judith G.; Rein, Alan; Oroszlan, Stephen",Adv Virus Res,148,22

As a rule, all income and expenditures are run jointly through the practice. Outwardly, the professional partnership forms a legal unit that is also reflected in the mutual liability of the partners. For the protection of this unit, the professional partnership is allowed to participate in the replacement of the licensing of a retiring partner through the successor, if the licensing is replaced within the professional partnership. Within the framework of the partnership contract, overall great care and in many aspects caution is also warranted. Additionally, the individual situation of the partnership and the individual partners must always be essentially taken into consideration. Even the local treatment situation has an important influence with respect to the requirements planning, particularly on regulation of retirement of a partner. In view of the complexity of the material, the partial aspects of the structure of a contract shown in this article and the appropriate regulatory options can only represent a small excerpt.

Through the application of biochemical and genetic methods, it is now possible to gain an insight into the molecular basis of these interactions. Thus, it has been shown that the glycoproteins of enveloped viruses play a central role in the initiation of infection. They are responsible not only for the adsorption of virions to cellular receptors, but are also for the entry of the genome into the cell by the fusion of viral envelopes with cellular membranes. Evidence is growing that the fusogenic glycoproteins are frequently activated by cellular proteases. The structure of the proteins at the cleavage site and the availability of a suitable protease are critical for tissue tropism, spread of the virus in the infected organism and, thus, for pathogenicity. This will be demonstrated here by the example of the haemagglutinin of influenza viruses.","Rott, R.; Klenk, H.-D.",Zentralbl Bakteriol Mikrobiol Hyg A,148,1

The most obvious difference could be found in expression of the surface protease aminopeptidase N (AP N/CD13). Whereas monoclonal antibodies specific to CD13 failed to reveal surface expression on lymphocytes of the PB; 63 ± 15% of SF T cells gave positive staining for CD 13 using Leu-M7. No correlation between CD13 expression and joint disease could be found in patients who had different types of inflammatory joint effusions. CD13 expression of T cells was also found in synovial tissue and inflammatory serous cavity effusions. Fixation of T cells revealed the presence of intracellular CD13 antigen already located in the PB T cells of healthy individuals. Induction of CD13 expression on PB T cells could be demonstrated after incubation with Con A/IL-2 or SF from patients with RA.

The database consisted of 6480 ATP measurements from four critical surfaces (student desktops, cafeteria tabletops, and restroom sinks and stall doors). Data was assessed according to ranges of ATP values before and after cleaning. Results showed the potential for such data to provide the basis for a standardized approach to the measurement of cleaning effectiveness, based on detection and quantification of pollutant loads of biological origin, across critical surfaces in school building environments. It is anticipated that verification of this data in school buildings across different geographic and climatic regions will lead to the establishment of “acceptable” ranges of ATP values that can be used as a practice-based approach to improving cleaning practices and contributing to healthier school environments.","Shaughnessy, Richard J.; Cole, Eugene C.; Moschandreas, Demetrios; Haverinen-Shaughnessy, Ulla",J Occup Environ Hyg,148,1

In the wake of Hurricane Maria in September 2017, hospitals across the USA had to quickly and creatively adjust medication preparation and administration techniques in light of decreased availability of intravenous (IV) bags used for compounding a vast amount of medications. Amino acid preparations, essential for compounding parenteral nutrition, were also directly impacted by the hurricane. Upon realization of the impending drug shortages, hospitals resorted to alternative methods of drug administration, such as IV push routes, formulary substitutions, or alternative drug therapies in hopes of preserving the small supply of IV bags available and prioritizing them for them most critical needs. In some cases, alternative drug therapies were required, which increased the risk of medication errors due to the use of less-familiar treatment options. Clinical pharmacists rounding with medical teams provided essential, patient-specific drug regimen alternatives to help preserve a dwindling supply while ensuring use in the most critical cases. Drug shortages also frequently occur in the setting of manufacturing delays or discontinuation and drug recalls, with potential to negatively impact patient care.

METHODS: We conducted a one-stage individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis exploring the association between NAI treatment and LoS in patients hospitalized with 2009 influenza A(H1N1) virus (A[H1N1]pdm09) infection. Using mixed-effects negative binomial regression and adjusting for the propensity to receive NAI, antibiotic, and corticosteroid treatment, we calculated incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Patients with a LoS of <1 day and those who died while hospitalized were excluded. RESULTS: We analyzed data on 18 309 patients from 70 clinical centers. After adjustment, NAI treatment initiated at hospitalization was associated with a 19% reduction in the LoS among patients with clinically suspected or laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection (IRR, 0.81; 95% CI, .78–.85), compared with later or no initiation of NAI treatment. Similar statistically significant associations were seen in all clinical subgroups. NAI treatment (at any time), compared with no NAI treatment, and NAI treatment initiated <2 days after symptom onset, compared with later or no initiation of NAI treatment, showed mixed patterns of association with the LoS. CONCLUSIONS: When patients hospitalized with influenza are treated with NAIs, treatment initiated on admission, regardless of time since symptom onset, is associated with a reduced LoS, compared with later or no initiation of treatment.","Venkatesan, Sudhir; Myles, Puja R; Bolton, Kirsty J; Muthuri, Stella G; Al Khuwaitir, Tarig; Anovadiya, Ashish P; Azziz-Baumgartner, Eduardo; Bajjou, Tahar; Bassetti, Matteo; Beovic, Bojana; Bertisch, Barbara; Bonmarin, Isabelle; Booy, Robert; Borja-Aburto, Victor H; Burgmann, Heinz; Cao, Bin; Carratala, Jordi; Chinbayar, Tserendorj; Cilloniz, Catia; Denholm, Justin T; Dominguez, Samuel R; Duarte, Pericles A D; Dubnov-Raz, Gal; Fanella, Sergio; Gao, Zhancheng; Gérardin, Patrick; Giannella, Maddalena; Gubbels, Sophie; Herberg, Jethro; Higuera Iglesias, Anjarath Lorena; Hoeger, Peter H; Hu, Xiao Yun; Islam, Quazi T; Jiménez, Mirela F; Keijzers, Gerben; Khalili, Hossein; Kusznierz, Gabriela; Kuzman, Ilija; Langenegger, Eduard; Lankarani, Kamran B; Leo, Yee-Sin; Libster, Romina P; Linko, Rita; Madanat, Faris; Maltezos, Efstratios; Mamun, Abdullah; Manabe, Toshie; Metan, Gokhan; Mickiene, Auksė; Mikić, Dragan; Mohn, Kristin G I; Oliva, Maria E; Ozkan, Mehpare; Parekh, Dhruv; Paul, Mical; Rath, Barbara A; Refaey, Samir; Rodríguez, Alejandro H; Sertogullarindan, Bunyamin; Skręt-Magierło, Joanna; Somer, Ayper; Talarek, Ewa; Tang, Julian W; To, Kelvin; Tran, Dat; Uyeki, Timothy M; Vaudry, Wendy; Vidmar, Tjasa; Zarogoulidis, Paul; Nguyen-Van-Tam, Jonathan S",J Infect Dis,148,3

Two waves of pandemic influenza—July 1918 to January 1919 and April to May 1919—were identified, for which the excess all-cause death rate was 195.7 per 10,000 persons. All districts of Portugal were affected. The pandemic hit earlier in southeastern districts and the main cities, but excess mortality was highest in the northeast, in line with the high death burden experienced by northern Spanish provinces. During the period of intense excess mortality (fall/winter 1918–1919), population density was negatively associated with pandemic impact. This pattern changed during the March 1919 to June 1920 wave, when excess mortality increased with population density and in northern and western directions. Portuguese islands were less and later affected. Given the geographic heterogeneity evidenced in our study, subnational sociodemographic characteristics and connectivity should be integrated in pandemic preparedness plans.","Nunes, Baltazar; Silva, Susana; Rodrigues, Ana; Roquette, Rita; Batista, Inês; Rebelo-de-Andrade, Helena",Am J Epidemiol,148,3

Here we applied this method on newborn piglets with induced lung complications. METHODS: Five mechanically ventilated piglets were subjected to stepwise increased and decreased fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO(2)), to atelectasis using a balloon catheter in the right bronchus, and to pneumothorax by injecting air in the pleural cavity. Two diode lasers (764 nm for O(2) gas absorption and 820 nm for H(2)O absorption) were combined in a probe delivering light either externally, on the skin, or internally, through the esophagus. The detector probe was placed dermally. RESULTS: Calculated O(2) concentrations increased from 20% (IQR 17−23%) when ventilated with room air to 97% (88−108%) at FiO(2) 1.0. H(2)O was only detectable with the internal light source. Specific light absorption and transmission patterns were identified in response to atelectasis and pneumothorax, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The optical method detected FiO(2) variations and discriminated the two induced lung pathologies, providing a rationale for further development into a minimally invasive device for real-time monitoring gas changes in the lungs of sick newborn infants. IMPACT: Optical spectroscopy can detect pulmonary complications in an animal model. Oxygen concentrations can be evaluated in the lungs. Presents a novel minimally invasive method to detect lung oxygenation and complications. Potential to be developed into a lung monitoring method in newborn infants. Potential for bed-side detection of pulmonary complications in newborn infants.","Svanberg, Emilie Krite; Larsson, Jim; Rasmussen, Martin; Larsson, Marcus; Leander, Dennis; Bergsten, Sara; Bood, Joakim; Greisen, Gorm; Fellman, Vineta",Pediatr Res,148,8

In order to increase engagement with nutrition professionals (NPs) on social media, we aimed to explore young adults’ perceptions of the authenticity and trustworthiness of SMIs and NPs Instagram posts. A cross-sectional questionnaire was administered to students (n = 149) from an Australian University. Participants viewed a real-life Instagram profile and one post from both a NP and a SMI. Main outcomes were post authenticity and trustworthiness, and emotional message appeals measured on five-point Likert scales. Regression models were developed to assess whose post (the NP or SMI) was perceived to be more authentic and trustworthy. Participants were young adults (median age (25th, 75th percentiles): 20 (19,21)), with approximately half identifying as female. A high heroic message appeal (+1SD above mean) significantly increased the perceived authenticity of the NPs post only (p = 0.01). Post authenticity enhanced post trustworthiness, but only when a heroic message appeal was used by the NP. When appropriate, NPs should convey positive emotions such as bravery and success to enhance the authenticity and trustworthiness of their posts.","Jenkins, Eva L.; Ilicic, Jasmina; Molenaar, Annika; Chin, Shinyi; McCaffrey, Tracy A.",Nutrients,148,1

RNA viruses, such as rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV), are among the viruses with the highest recombination rates. Several recombination events have been described for RHDV, mostly as a consequence of their genomic architecture. Here, we undertook phylogenetic and recombination analyses of French and Swedish RHDV strains from 1994 to 2016 and uncovered a new intergenotypic recombination event. This event occurred in the late 1990s/early 2000s and involved nonpathogenic GI.3 strains as donors for the nonstructural part of the genome of these recombinants, while pathogenic GI.1d strains contributed to the structural part. These GI.3P–GI.1d recombinant strains did not entirely replace GI.1d (nonrecombinant) strains, but became the dominant strains in France and Sweden, likely due to a fitness advantage associated with this genomic architecture. GI.3P–GI.1d (P stands for polymerase) strains persisted until 2013 and 2016 in Sweden and France, respectively, and cocirculated with the new genotype GI.2 in France. Since strains from the first GI.2 outbreaks were GI.3P–GI.2, we hypothesize that GI.3P–GI.1d could be the parental strain. Our results confirm the outstanding recombination ability of RHDV and its importance in the evolution of lagoviruses, which was only revealed by studying complete genomic sequences.","Abrantes, Joana; Lopes, Ana M.; Lemaitre, Evelyne; Ahola, Harri; Banihashem, Fereshteh; Droillard, Clément; Marchandeau, Stéphane; Esteves, Pedro J.; Neimanis, Aleksija; Le Gall-Reculé, Ghislaine",Genes (Basel),148,1

Previous studies have demonstrated that Ralstonia solanacearum employs two different types of QS systems. We report here that anthranilic acid controls important biological functions and the production of QS signals in R. solanacearum. It was demonstrated that the biosynthesis of anthranilic acid is mainly performed by TrpEG. The accumulation of anthranilic acid and the transcription of trpEG occur in a cell density-dependent manner in R. solanacearum. Both the anthranilic acid and TrpEG homologues are conserved in various bacterial species. Moreover, we show that Sporisorium scitamineum sexual mating and hypha formation are strongly inhibited by the addition of exogenous anthranilic acid. Our results suggest that anthranilic acid is important for the physiology of bacteria in addition to its role in inter-kingdom communication.","Song, Shihao; Yin, Wenfang; Sun, Xiuyun; Cui, Binbin; Huang, Lei; Li, Peng; Yang, Liang; Zhou, Jianuan; Deng, Yinyue",ISME J,148,1

Despite many successful endeavors, the understanding of co-evolutionary signals in eukaryotes remains partial. Our hypothesis is that ‘Clades’, branches of the tree of life (e.g. primates and mammals), encompass signals that cannot be detected by PP using all eukaryotes. As such, integrating information from different clades should reveal local co-evolution signals and improve function prediction. Accordingly, we analyzed 1028 genomes in 66 clades and demonstrated that the co-evolutionary signal was scattered across clades. We showed that functionally related genes are frequently co-evolved in only parts of the eukaryotic tree and that clades are complementary in detecting functional interactions within pathways. We examined the non-homologous end joining pathway and the UFM1 ubiquitin-like protein pathway and showed that both demonstrated distinguished co-evolution patterns in specific clades. Our research offers a different way to look at co-evolution across eukaryotes and points to the importance of modular co-evolution analysis. We developed the ‘CladeOScope’ PP method to integrate information from 16 clades across over 1000 eukaryotic genomes and is accessible via an easy to use web server at http://cladeoscope.cs.huji.ac.il.","Tsaban, Tomer; Stupp, Doron; Sherill-Rofe, Dana; Bloch, Idit; Sharon, Elad; Schueler-Furman, Ora; Wiener, Reuven; Tabach, Yuval",NAR Genom Bioinform,148,19

Local class-switch recombination has been intimated but B cell precursors and mechanisms remain elusive. Here we describe the dynamics underlying the generation of IgE-antibody secreting cells (ASC) in human nasal polyps (NP), mucosal tissues rich in ASC without germinal centers (GC). Using V(H) next generation sequencing, we identified an extrafollicular (EF) mucosal IgD+ naïve-like intermediate B cell population with high connectivity to the mucosal IgE ASC. Mucosal IgD+ B cells, express germline epsilon transcripts and predominantly co-express IgM. However, a small but significant fraction co-express IgG or IgA instead which also show connectivity to ASC IgE. Phenotypically, NP IgD+ B cells display an activated profile and molecular evidence of BCR engagement. Transcriptionally, mucosal IgD+ B cells reveal an intermediate profile between naïve B cells and ASC. Single cell IgE ASC analysis demonstrates lower mutational frequencies relative to IgG, IgA, and IgD ASC consistent with IgE ASC derivation from mucosal IgD+ B cell with low mutational load. In conclusion, we describe a novel mechanism of GC-independent, extrafollicular IgE ASC formation at the nasal mucosa whereby activated IgD+ naïve B cells locally undergo direct and indirect (through IgG and IgA), IgE class switch.","Corrado, Alessia; Ramonell, Richard P.; Woodruff, Matthew C.; Tipton, Christopher; Wise, Sarah; Levy, Joshua; DelGaudio, John; Kuruvilla, Merin E.; Magliocca, Kelly R.; Tomar, Deepak; Garimalla, Swetha; Scharer, Christopher D.; Boss, Jeremy M.; Wu, Hao; Gumber, Sanjeev; Fucile, Chris; Gibson, Greg; Rosenberg, Alexander; Sanz, Iñaki; Lee, F.

OBJECTIVE: Due to the specific nature of work in operating theaters, factors that affect the staff performance and therefore predispose to burnout syndrome were assessed. METHODS: Based on the original questionnaire, 254 respondents working in the operating theaters of the university hospital, appraised levels of work satisfaction, sources of stress, and psychosocial burden. Work-related mental stress was assessed using the Meister's questionnaire. Burnout levels were evaluated in the group extended to 316 employees with Maslach Burnout Inventory. RESULTS: Work satisfaction analysis indicated unsatisfactory management and remuneration as the negative agents. The majority of the respondents emphasized the maintenance of medical records as a prominent stress factor. A large number of participants (n = 221; 87%) described work as emotionally burdensome. The results showed that the highest burden was related to the following variables: time pressure, responsibility, problems, and conflicts. The examined group was qualified to the second degree of mental load related to the work. Similarly, the entire group reached a high level of emotional exhaustion.

The analysis of LV rotational deformation is challenging and requires standardization of image acquisition as well as postprocessing analysis. The aim of this study was to test the feasibility to analyse LV rotational deformation using 2DSTE by introducing a novel algorithm for the detection of artefacts. The study was performed in 20 healthy subjects serving as a control group and in 53 competitive sportsmen. Circumferential, radial strain (CS, RS) and LV rotation were analysed by 2DSTE in parasternal short axis views. The stepwise algorithm to exclude potential artefacts starts with the visual estimation of the image quality with respect to complete visualization of all myocardial segments during the entire cardiac cycle followed by the exclusion of data sets in participants with conduction abnormalities. The next step is the optimization of tracking areas and a cross-check of implausible strain waveforms in multiple acquired comparable cineloops. The last step is the exclusion of strain curves with persisting implausible waveforms if standardization failures and incorrect LV wall tracking are fixed. Plausible physiological strain curves were observed in 89% (n = 65/73) of all subjects. In controls all implausible waveforms could be verified as artefacts. The algorithm was applied in 53 professional athletes to test and confirm its feasibility. Abnormal CS waveforms were documented in 25 athletes, verified as artefacts due to tracking failures in 22 athletes and due to incorrect image acquisition in 3 athletes. CS artefacts were mostly located in the basal posterior and lateral LV segments. (endocardial: 6%, n = 4/70; p < 0.05) and basal posterior (endocardial: 8%, n = 5/70; p < 0.05) segments were highly susceptible to artefacts. 2DSTE of parasternal short axis views to analyse circumferential and radial deformation as well as LV rotation is feasible in athletes. The proposed algorithm helps to avoid artefacts and might contribute to standardization of this technique. 2DSTE might provide an interesting diagnostic tool for the detection of viral myocarditis, e.g. in athletes.

METHODS: We included 850 patients with MS treated with interferon beta formulations, from 2015 to 2019, seen at the MS Clinical Care and Research Centre (Federico II University of Naples, Italy) and with linkage to routinely-collected healthcare data (prescription data, hospital admissions, outpatient services). We extracted and computed clinical outcomes (relapses, 6-month EDSS progression using a roving EDSS as reference), persistence (time spent on a specific interferon beta formulation), adherence (medication possession ratio (MPR)), healthcare resource utilization and costs (annualized hospitalization rate (AHR), costs for hospital admissions and DMTs). To evaluate differences between interferon beta formulations, we used linear regression (adherence), Poisson regression (AHR), mixed-effect regression (costs), and Cox-regression models (time varying variables); covariates were age, sex, treatment duration, baseline EDSS and adherence. RESULTS: Looking at clinical outcomes, rates of relapses and EDSS progression were lower than studies run on previous cohorts; there was no differences in relapse risk between interferon beta formulations. Risk of discontinuation was higher for Betaferon®/Extavia® (HR = 3.28; 95%CI = 2.11, 5.12; p<0.01).

Therefore, we studied how body mass index (BMI) contributes to complications after femoral fractures. METHODS: Using the 2016 American College of Surgeons Trauma Quality Improvement Program (ACS TQIP) database, we stratified 41,362 patients into groups based on their BMI: Normal Weight (NW), Overweight (OW), Obese (OB), Severely Obese (SO), and Morbidly Obese (MO). We compared each BMI group to the NW cohort for differences in demographic factors, comorbidities, complications, and mechanism of injury. RESULTS: OB, SO, and MO patients sustained higher rates of traumatic injury from high energy mechanisms, such as motor vehicle trauma, in comparison to NW patients, who sustained more injuries from falls (p < 0.05). Correspondingly, obese patients were more likely than NW patients to sustain shaft and distal end fractures (p < 0.05). At hospital admission, obese patients presented with more comorbidities, such as bleeding disorders, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension (p < 0.05). Despite these individual findings, patients with OB, SO, and MO BMI, as opposed to NW BMI, were independently associated with a higher probability of developing at least one post-trauma complication. More specifically, MO patients were associated with a 45% higher odds of developing a complication (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Irrespective of presenting with more comorbidities and sustaining high energy injuries, OB, SO, and MO patients were independently associated with having a higher risk of developing complications following a femoral fracture. Overall, better clinical outcomes are observed among patients with no underlying conditions and normal BMI.","Soliman, Sara S.; Jordan, Garrett B.; Bilaniuk, Jaroslaw W.; Benfante, Amanda; Kong, Karen; Rolandelli, Rolando H.; Curran, Terrence; Nemeth, Zoltan H.",Eur J Trauma Emerg Surg,148,3

Serological tests to determine TCoV-specific antibodies are critical to evaluate previous exposure to TCoV in the turkey flocks and differentiate serotypes from different isolates or strains. A specific virus neutralization assay using embryonated turkey eggs and immunofluorescent antibody assay for determining TCoV-specific neutralizing antibodies is described in this chapter. Virus neutralization titer of turkey serum from turkeys infected with TCoV is the dilution of serum that can inhibit TCoV infection in 50 % of embryonated turkey eggs. Virus neutralization assay for TCoV is useful to monitor the immune status of turkey flocks infected with TCoV for the control of the disease.,"Chen, Yi-Ning; Wu, Ching Ching; Lin, Tsang Long",Animal Coronaviruses,148,12

26842,26842,26842,Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation,13.5782175,9.555352,2016-09-16,"Septic syndromes represent a major although largely under-recognized healthcare problem worldwide accounting for thousands of deaths every year [1–3]. Mortality remains high ranging from 20 % for sepsis to over 50 % for septic shock despite almost 20 years of anti-inflammatory clinical trials [1–3]. The inability of these therapies to mitigate the devastating effects of this condition indicates that the initial hypotheses for sepsis pathophysiology may have been misconstrued or inadequately addressed. Two major explanations have been proposed: 1) Septic patients have mainly been treated as a group despite the extreme heterogeneity characterizing this population [1]; 2) The postulate that death after sepsis is solely due to an overwhelming pro-inflammatory immune response may actually be inaccurate [1, 3]. Indeed, several lines of evidence have now established that death from septic shock is probably due to the effect of distinct mechanisms over time [1–3]. Early in the course of the disease, a massive release of inflammatory mediators (normally designed to trigger an immune response against pathogens) is occurring that may be responsible for organ dysfunction and hypoperfusion [1, 3]. Concomitantly, the body develops compensatory mechanisms to prevent overwhelming inflammation and dampen an over-zealous anti-infectious response [1–3]. These negative feedback mechanisms, although having protective effects during the first initial hours, may paradoxically become deleterious as they persist over time leading to immune paralysis (Fig. 1) [1, 3]. Indeed, considerable clinical and experimental evidence indicates that patients rapidly present with numerous compromised immune functions [1, 3]. As our capacity to treat patients during the very first hours of shock has improved (early and aggressive initial supportive therapy) [1], many patients now survive this critical step but eventually die later in a state of immunosuppression that is illustrated by difficulty fighting the primary bacterial infection and decreased resistance to secondary nosocomial infections [1, 3]. Consequently, immunostimulatory therapies are now considered as an innovative strategy for the treatment of sepsis [1, 3]. However, the first critical step is to be able to identify patients who would actually benefit from these therapies [2, 3]. Indeed, in the absence of specific clinical signs of immune status, it is critical to determine the best biological tools to stratify patients according to their immune status (a missing step in most previous clinical trials) [1–3]. This would define the right action (i.e., stimulating innate immunity and/or adaptive immunity, blocking apoptosis, restoring other altered functions) at the right time (early or delayed treatment) in the right patient (individualized/tailored therapy).","Venet, F.; Lepape, A.; Monneret, G.",Yearbook of Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine,148,8

The review presented in this study suggests that the intention to purchase is the most frequently examined dependent variable and that trust in the social commerce context is a key factor.","Sarker, Prianka; Hughe, Laurie; Dwivedi, Yogesh K.; Rana, Nripendra P.","Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology",148,1

Aetiological study in a tropical medicine unit,13.782326,9.513193,2007-04-14,"Increasingly, research attention is being afforded to various forms of problematic media use. Despite ongoing conceptual, theoretical, and empirical debates, a large number of retrospective self-report scales have been produced to ostensibly measure various classes of such behaviour. These scales are typically based on a variety of theoretical and diagnostic frameworks. Given current conceptual ambiguities, building on previous studies, we evaluated the dimensional structure of 50 scales targeting the assessment of supposedly problematic behaviours in relation to four technologies: Internet, smartphones, video games, and social network sites. We find that two dimensions (‘compulsive use’ and ‘negative outcomes’) account for over 50% of all scale-items analysed. With a median of five dimensions, on average, scales have considered fewer dimensions than various proposed diagnostic criteria and models. No relationships were found between the number of items in a scale and the number of dimensions, or the technology category and the dimensional structure. The findings indicate, firstly, that a majority of scales place an inordinate emphasis on some dimensions over others and, secondly, that despite differences in the items presented, at a dimensional level, there exists a high degree of similarity between scales. These findings highlight shortcomings in existing scales and underscore the need to develop more sophisticated conceptions and empirical tools to understand possible problematic interactions with various digital technologies.","Abendroth, Adrian; Parry, Douglas A.; le Roux, Daniel B.; Gundlach, Jana","Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology",148,19

The purpose of this study was to design a model to support the alignment of value in Smart City initiatives. To address this purpose, a systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted to find what Smart City initiatives have been addressed in empirical studies, and what dimensions and factors are linked to these initiatives. The SLR also identified the stakeholders in a Smart City, and what their roles should be linked to these initiatives. Six theories were identified and used to undergird the researcher’s understanding of the domains of Smart Cities, value and alignment. The concepts from these theories were then used with the SLR findings to design a conceptual model for Smart City initiatives. The proposed Value Alignment Smart City Model (VASC) can be used to plan or assess Smart City initiatives. The main contribution is the alignment of value amongst stakeholders to support the success of such initiatives. Further research is required to investigate adopting the model and empirically evaluate it.","van der Hoogen, Anthea; Scholtz, Brenda; Calitz, Andre P.","Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology",148,1

The lack of reliable data and the short operating history of China as a semicapitalist country make firm conclusions difficult. However, overall the evidence points to further problems in the Chinese banking and real estate sectors. If this is true, then it is not too late to short Chinese banks and property stocks. Some investors predict that China's real estate bubble will soon burst as the property prices in China are relatively high with respect to GDP per capita and as the Chinese government took actions in April 2010 to regulate real estate prices. However, economic activities in China are controlled by central and municipal governments, sizable state-owned banks, and enterprises to a great extent. In 2010, the magnitude of bank lending has been reduced greatly following the change in monetary policy. This is expected to cool down the transaction volume of the real estate market. Even with the drop of property prices, the Chinese central government is taking measures to curb current real estate prices. A decline of 30% or more in real estate prices is widely accepted by the central government, but it is not certain that commercial banks can assume such big declines. Possibly a decline of over 50% in real estate prices is expected to induce a new wave of financial crisis in China. Therefore, a rapid drop in real estate prices is hazardous to the banking system and the government expects a slow decline. The Chinese government has recognized that a bubble currently exists and has opted to contain real estate prices to maintain a “harmonious society.”","Treadway, Peter T.; Michael C.S., Wong",Handbook of Short Selling,148,1

The markets in the developed world are now relatively mature and will show little growth for new products in the future. Growth in the developed world is concentrated on the replacement market, which represents over one-third of the total valve market. New sales growth is now concentrated in developing regions such as China, India, and South America. The majority of investment in oil exploration and development will take place in the developing countries in the Middle East, Africa, Central and South America, and South and East Asia. Chemical processing would continue to move its manufacturing to these areas with large populations and growing living standards. These improved living standards would also lead to investment in infrastructure such as extension of piped water supplies and wastewater treatment services and power generation. The major driving force in Europe is the increasing impact of the EU directives upon national legislation in subjects as diverse as water treatment and pressure system design. The major valve application in the Middle East is in the oil and petrochemical industries with the region producing nearly 30% of the world's oil, with an increasing requirement for water treatment such as desalination plants. Most of the valve sales to the region are made through large plant contractors and oil companies.","Weaver, Graham",Profile of the International Valve Industry,148,8

It has narrowly lanceolate valves (26–55 μm long, 4–5 μm wide) and girdles 10–24 μm in depth. Striae are parallel at the center of the valve (24–28 in 10 μm), becoming slightly convergent toward the apices. Electron microscopy revealed that the external valve surface presents a longitudinally ribbed appearance (20–28 parallel ribs at its maximum width), whereas internally, rectangular areolae are occluded by ricae. The raphe slit lies in a narrow axial area, and one side of the raphe sternum is deeper and folds over the other, obscuring the internal opening. Internally, the central virga on one side of the raphe and two virgae on the other are somewhat broader. A conspicuous pore (stigma) is present between the two broadened virgae. The girdle consists of valvocopulae, copulae, and pleurae. There are 16–20 bands per cingulum. The valvocopulae and copulae are hollow tube‐like structures, with inner and outer portions contrsting in morphology. They decrease in diameter in an abvalvar direction. There are four pleurae. These are flat bands which facilitate overlap of the epicingulum and hypocingulum. Fundamental features of the valve and girdle reveal the distinctness of this species within Navicula. The areolae, external longitudinal ribs, and raphe structure suggest affinities with Pleurosigma, Gyrosigma, and Haslea. It is hypothesized that they share a derived state which indicates a recent common ancestor for these taxa. N. complanatoides and related species of the Naviculae microstigmatacae are distinctive enough to merit their own genus within the Naviculaceae.","Brogan, Michael W.; Rosowski, James R.",J Phycol,148,1

For example, pneumonia is a clinical diagnosis of lung infection that may be caused by viral, bacterial, fungal or other pathogens. The study of pneumonia aetiology is challenging because directly sampling from the lung to identify the aetiologic pathogen is not standard clinical practice in most settings. Instead, measurements from multiple peripheral specimens are made. The paper introduces the statistical methodology designed for estimating the population aetiology distribution and the individual aetiology probabilities in the Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health study of 9500 children for seven sites around the world. We formulate the scientific problem in statistical terms as estimating the mixing weights and latent class indicators under a partially latent class model (PLCM) that combines heterogeneous measurements with different error rates obtained from a case–control study. We introduce the PLCM as an extension of the latent class model. We also introduce graphical displays of the population data and inferred latent class frequencies. The methods are tested with simulated data, and then applied to Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health data. The paper closes with a brief description of extensions of the PLCM to the regression setting and to the case where conditional independence between the measures is relaxed.","Wu, Zhenke; Deloria‐Knoll, Maria; Hammitt, Laura L.; Zeger, Scott L.",J R Stat Soc Ser C Appl Stat,148,1

Heat shock proteins (HSPs) act as adjuvants when coadministered with peptide antigens or given as fusion proteins. However, there is a potential risk of autoimmunity when using the complete molecules, because HSPs are evolutionary conserved. To overcome this, we first evaluated the adjuvant effect against two different antigens of a less‐conserved fraction of Plasmodium falciparum HSP70 (Pf70C) and compared it to the whole HSP70 molecule from Trypanosoma cruzi (TcHSP70). We found that Pf70C exhibited similar adjuvant properties as the whole molecule. We later evaluated the adjuvant potential of Pf70C against the malarial antigen EB200 in a chimeric DNA construct. No appreciable levels of EB200‐specific antibodies were detected in mice immunized only with the DNA constructs. However, DNA primed the immune system, because subsequent challenge with the corresponding recombinant fusion proteins elicited a strong Th‐1 antibody response. In contrast, no priming effect was observed for ex vivo IFN‐γ production but stimulation with the HSP‐chimeric fusion protein induced a stronger secretion of IFN‐γin vitro than other proteins used. These results indicate that the use of HSPs is promising in the design of new vaccines.","Rahman, Q. K.; Wikman, M.; Vasconcelos, N.‐M.; Berzins, K.; Ståhl, S.; Fernández, C.",Scand J Immunol,148,28

Influenza viruses have developed ways to evade the body's immune response using an antigenic variation known as antigenic shift (replacement of HA and NA antigens with novel subtypes from noninfluenza viruses) and drift (mutations within antibody-binding sites in HA and or NA). Because of new influenza viruses constantly emerging from antigenic shift and drift, new influenza vaccines are required each year. Human-to-human transmission of influenza occurs each winter and early spring through small-particle aerosols or droplets. The influenza virus attacks epithelial cells of the upper and lower respiratory tract, with the potential for secondary bacterial infection and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The symptoms of influenza infection include fever, headache, cough, sore throat, myalgia, and nasal congestion. Lower respiratory tract manifestations such as pneumonia and bronchiolitis are virtually indistinguishable from other viral infections. Children with certain comorbidities, such as chronic lung disease and severe neurologic impairment, are at higher risk of influenza-related complications. The most reliable test for influenza is reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Rapid antigen tests have lower sensitivity and specificity and are not reliable during periods of low influenza activity. Antiviral treatment with NA inhibitors can shorten the duration of fever, symptoms, and hospitalization, especially when started within 48 hours of influenza illness onset. Prevention of influenza through annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all children 6 months of age and older. The vaccines contain three or four influenza subtypes, chosen depending on the circulating strains. The two formulations approved for children are the inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) and live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV).","Rao, Suchitra; Nyquist, Ann-Christine; Stillwell, Paul C.",Kendig's Disorders of the Respiratory Tract in Children,148,12

Fingerprinting is a technique by which oligonucleotides, produced by cleavage of RNA molecules with specific ribonucleases, are separated in two dimensions. It is a definitive method of identifying RNA viruses according to their genotypes. It is not subject to the problems of antigenic drift or antigenic convergence that complicate serological identification. Furthermore, it provides a semiquantitative means of following the evolution of viral genomes in nature. Because all regions of the genome are represented by the large diagnostic oligonucleotides, a survey of the total genomic changes can be monitored. Fingerprinting has two limitations as a diagnostic tool. First, although highly definitive, fingerprinting is not as rapid or inexpensive as serological techniques and cannot be as easily scaled up for routine identification of a large number of samples. Second, the evolutionary range of fingerprinting is short and relationships may not be evident for isolates of rapidly evolving viruses obtained over long intervals. However, these limitations are not large, compared to the full benefits offered to the virologist by the fingerprinting method.","Kew, Olen M.; Nottay, Baldev K.; Obijeski, John F.",,148,8

In other words, a strong coupling is considered when product and process are created simultaneously. As a result of the proven NP-hardness of such problems, solution methods have extensively utilized different decomposition principles. The known decomposition methods in discrete optimization are founded on the difficulties in deriving analytical properties. The existing solutions in continuous optimization are based on the maximum principle and yield a dynamic process decomposition using the natural logic of time. By combining the advantages of continuous and discrete optimization, this chapter develops a decomposition method for shop floor scheduling in Industry 4.0 manufacturing systems. Technically, this study proposes to decompose dynamically the large-scale assignment matrix according to the precedence relations between the operations of the jobs and considers only the operations that satisfy these precedence relations at a given time point in small-dimensional, discrete optimization models. Continuous optimization is used to generate a schedule from the assignments found in the discrete optimization models at each time point by extremizing the Hamiltonian function at this time point subject to scheduling objective(s). In addition, the execution of the operations in time can be accurately modeled in continuous time as a continuous state variable; the machine availability and capacity disturbances at the machines are also considered. The method developed provides further insights into decomposition methods for scheduling and is supported by an analytical analysis and an algorithmic realization.","Ivanov, Dmitry; Sokolov, Boris; Werner, Frank; Dolgui, Alexandre",Scheduling in Industry 4.0 and Cloud Manufacturing,148,1

Well-behaved processes are transformed into Go code that supports non-deterministic synchronizations and race-freedom. We sketch two main examples involving protection against message forwarding, and forward secrecy, and discuss the features of the tool, and the generated code.

We aimed to evaluate the accuracy of sonographic assessment of diaphragmatic thickness and excursion in predicting successful extubation of preterm infants from invasive conventional mechanical ventilation. Preterm infants less than 32 weeks gestation who required invasive conventional mechanical ventilation were evaluated by diaphragmatic sonography within 1 h of their planned extubation. Infants were classified into successful or failed extubation groups based on their ability to stay off invasive mechanical ventilation for 72 h after extubation. Inspiratory and expiratory thickness plus excursion of the right and left hemidiaphragm as well as diaphragmatic thickening fraction (DTF) measures were compared between groups. We included 43 eligible infants, of whom 34 infants succeeded and 9 infants failed extubation. Infants in the successful extubation group had a significantly higher expiratory thickness of the right and left hemidiaphragm, excursion of the right and left hemidiaphragm, inspiratory thickness of the left hemidiaphragm, and DTF of the left hemidiaphragm compared with infants who failed extubation. The receiver-operating characteristic curves showed that excursion of the right and left hemidiaphragm has the highest significant accuracy in predicting successful extubation of preterm infants among all diaphragmatic parameters (AUC is 0.98 and 0.96, respectively; p value < 0.001 for both). Conclusion: We conclude that diaphragmatic excursion is a useful indicator for successful extubation of preterm infants from mechanical ventilation.","Bahgat, Eslam; El-Halaby, Hanan; Abdelrahman, Ashraf; Nasef, Nehad; Abdel-Hady, Hesham",Eur J Pediatr,148,16

At the same time, the inhabitants of extreme econiches remained almost unexplored for a long time in terms of the chemistry of natural compounds. In recent years, the emergence of new antibiotic-resistant strains of pathogens, which affect humans and animals has become a global problem. The problem is compounded by a strong slowdown in the development of new antibiotics. In search of new active substances and scaffolds for medical chemistry, researchers turn to unexplored natural sources.

Also, there is only a fragmented understanding about how the cash holdings concept is formed among researchers and experts. We fill this gap in the literature by identifying and evaluating the research development of cash holdings topic. Using 874 articles from the Scopus database that were published between 1947 and early 2020, bibliometric and content analyses were employed to assess the patterns of global cash holdings research. We find that previous studies have substantially enriched our knowledge of the antecedents and consequences of cash holdings. Yet, there are still several opportunities to make significant contributions in this area. The contribution of this research is to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the development of cash holdings research (using a sizeable archival database). It identifies the current joint development and potential opportunities for future work directions on cash holdings association with payout policy, corporate social responsibility, and corporate governance. Our results are likely to be of interest to academics, practitioners, and educators in related business and finance fields.","Khatib, Saleh F.

It is seen as the green solution for the increased demand in energy, but the problems that will occur after 20–30 years when these solar panels have to be disposed of are seldom considered. Due to increased growth in the development and utilization of solar energy resources, the disposal of waste solar panels has become problematic. Photovoltaic systems are in the lead because they are cost-effective, and it has increased efficiency. All these systems are expected to produce much e-waste by the end of their life cycle. Currently, the research is focused on how to increase the efficiency of solar panels rather than focusing on the disassembling and recycling of the panels. By recycling silicon-based solar panels, valuable metals within the panels can be recovered instead of lost to the landfill. Proper disposal of many compounds is not yet discovered; hence they are landfilled without any treatment, which causes harm to the environment. The environmental policies constrict market projections for Cadmium Telluride (CdTe) Photovoltaic (PV) because Cadmium has Carcinogenic properties. This paper aims to review the present and upcoming or subsequent recycling technologies for solar panels and produce a recycling technology that is most sustainable and likely to be acquired in the coming years. Although these technologies require advanced techniques and enhanced improvement before execution, when all these progressive technologies are combined, they will provide better recycling options for the generated solar e-waste.","Jariwala, Nidhi; Soni, Jaykumar",The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Green Societies,148,1

Though, due to diverse reasons our efforts were not enough. But now as the outbreak of COVID-19 has hit mankind globally, many countries are forced to implement self-quarantine, resulting in anthropogenic activities across the globe coming to a halt, especially in production/manufacturing. It has been clearly established that ever growing industrialization for the last two decades has immensely polluted the atmosphere, biosphere, and hydrosphere; also other overlooked concerns like noise pollution, soil pollution, etc., never gets adequate attention. As recently, all the activities have been seized considerably, the pollution level in the environment is expected to go down within a curtailed period. This chapter undertakes a brief and specific scenario of industrial pollution during lockdown; hence, the aim is to be focused on the dissemination of information in general, related to the current parameters regarding the status of the decreased level of industrial pollution in air, water, and soil. In the context of water pollution we have discussed the improvement of water quality in terms of change in pH, total dissolved solids (TDS), suspended particulate matter (SPM), biological oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), heavy metal contamination in sewage as well as ground water, and biological parameters like reduction in coliforms, fecal coliforms, organic wastes, planktonic population, etc., whereas in case of air pollution it was found that there has been a sharp drop in the major air pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, O(3), SO(2), CO, hydrocarbons, and NO(2) as compared to the pre-lockdown phase, same consequences were also obtained in case issues related to the soil pollution. Also recent observations suggest that the ozone hole at Earth’s polar regions has begun to heal. These changing statistics of pollution rate can help us in the exploration of various public and private views, which could further encourage us to adopt better pollution controlling strategies; highlighting and also examining different social, economical, and technical challenges related to industrial pollution.","Sharma, Raj Shekhar; Panthari, Divyansh; Semwal, Shikha; Uniyal, Tripti",The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Green Societies,148,1

Mask fit-testing is therefore essential to protect healthcare workers. METHOD: Using the Freedom of Information Act, 137 acute NHS trusts in the UK were approached on the 26/3/2020 by an independent researcher to provide data on the outcome of fit testing at each site. RESULTS: 85 Trusts responded to the FOI with 51 trusts providing pertinent data relevant to the FOI request. There was a total of 72 mask types used across 51 trusts. The commonest of which was the FFP3M1863 (used by 47/51 trusts, 92.16%). A positive correlation was found between staff members and number of mask types used (r = 0.75, P = <0.05). Overall fit-testing pass rates were provided by 32 trusts. The mean percentage pass rate was 80.74%. Gender specific failure rates were provided by seven trusts. 4386 males underwent fit-testing in comparison to 16305 females. Across all seven trusts 20.08% of men tested failed the fit-test while only 19.89% of women failed the fit-test.

The Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends a 30 mL/kg fluid bolus in these patients, but recent studies suggest an association between large volume crystalloid resuscitation and increased mortality. The optimal amount of pre-operative fluid resuscitation prior to source control in patients with intra-abdominal sepsis is unknown. This study aims to determine if increasing volume of resuscitation prior to surgical source control is associated with worsening outcomes. METHODS: We conducted an 8-year retrospective chart review of EGS patients undergoing surgery for abdominal sepsis within 24 h of admission. Patients in hemorrhagic shock and those with outside hospital index surgeries were excluded. We grouped patients by increasing pre-operative resuscitation volume in 10 ml/kg intervals up to > 70 ml/kg and later grouped them into < 30 ml/kg or ≥ 30 ml/kg. A relative risk regression model compared amounts of fluid administration. Mortality was the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcomes were time to operation, ventilator days, and length of stay (LOS). Groups were compared by quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) and SOFA scoring systems. RESULTS: Of the 301 patients included, the mean age was 55, 51% were male, 257 (85%) survived to discharge. With increasing fluid per kg (< 10 to < 70 ml/kg), there was an increasing mortality per decile, 8.8% versus 31.6% (p = 0.004). Patients who received < 30 mL/kg had lower mortality (11.3 vs 21%) than those who received > 30 ml/kg (p = 0.02). These groups had median qSOFA scores (1.0 vs. 1.0, p = 0.06). There were no differences in time to operation (6.1 vs 4.9 h p = 0.11), ventilator days (1 vs 3, p = 0.08), or hospital LOS (8 vs 9 days, p = 0.57). Relative risk regression correcting for age and physiologic factors showed no significant differences in mortality between the fluid groups. CONCLUSIONS: Greater pre-operative resuscitation volumes were initially associated with significantly higher mortality, despite similar organ failure scores. However, fluid volumes were not associated with mortality following adjustment for other physiologic factors in a regression model. The amount of pre-operative volume resuscitation was not associated with differences in time to operation, ventilator days, ICU or hospital LOS.","Moran, Benjamin; Major, Erin; Kufera, Joseph A.; Tisherman, Samuel A.; Diaz, Jose",BMC Emerg Med,148,1

There are numerous resources available; however, each has its own advantages and disadvantages. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this survey was to gain knowledge of the preferred methods and sources HCPs use to obtain information concerning medications. METHODS: A total of 511 HCPs (202 physicians, 105 pharmacists, 100 advance practice nurses, 53 registered nurses, and 51 physician assistants) were surveyed through a third-party market research firm. All participants were practicing in the United States. Individuals working for a pharmaceutical company were excluded. The survey collected demographics, frequency of searching medical information, types of questions searched, sources of medical information, and rationale for preferred and nonpreferred sources of medical information. Use of medical information resources were rated on a 5-point ordinal scale. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Of the 511 respondents, 88.5% (452/511) searched for medical information either daily or several times per week. The most common questions involved dosing and administration, drug-drug interactions, adverse events and safety, clinical practice guidelines, and disease state information. The main rationale for using specific medical websites or apps and general online search engines frequently or very frequently was ease of use (medical websites or apps: 269/356, 75.6%; general online search engines: 248/284, 87.3%). Accuracy was the main rationale for frequent or very frequent use of medical literature search databases (163/245, 66.5%), prescribing labels or information (122/213, 57.3%), and professional literature (120/195, 61.5%). The main reason for rarely or never using specific medical websites or apps and medical literature search databases was unfamiliarity (medical websites or apps: 16/48, 33%; medical literature search databases: 35/78, 45%); for general online search engines, inaccuracy (34/54, 63%); and for prescribing labels or information and professional literature, excessive time (prescribing labels or information : 54/102, 52.9%; professional literature: 66/106, 62.3%). The pharmaceutical company was sometimes used as a resource for medical information. When the medical information department was used, the call center and the website were considered thorough and complete (call center: 14/25, 56%; website: 33/55, 60%). However, the rationale for not using the call center was the time required (199/346, 57.5%) and the website being unfamiliar (129/267, 48.3%). CONCLUSIONS: The driving forces in the selection of resources are accuracy and ease of use. There is an opportunity to increase awareness of all the appropriate resources for HCPs which may aid in their daily clinical decisions. Specifically, pharmaceutical company medical information departments can help fulfill this need by addressing two major challenges with use of the pharmaceutical company: lack of awareness of medical information services and the speed at which responses are disseminated. Overall, there is lack of understanding or appreciation of the range of pathways to obtain published information and knowledge from pharmaceutical company medical information services. Among the many challenges resource champions will face are the ability to effectively make resources and their platforms accessible, known, and useful to the scientific community.","Hermes-DeSantis, Evelyn R; Hunter, Robert T; Welch, Julie; Bhavsar, Roma; Boulos, Daniel; Noue, Marie-Ange",J Med Internet Res,148,1

A large number of SUMO targets in cells have been identified by Proteomics, but biological roles for SUMO conjugation for most targets remains elusive. The multi-aminoacyl tRNA synthetase complex (MARS) is a sensor and regulator of immune signaling. The proteins of this 1.2 MDa complex are targets of SUMO conjugation, in response to infection. Arginyl tRNA Synthetase (RRS), a member of the sub-complex II of MARS, is one such SUMO conjugation target. The sites for SUMO conjugation are Lys 147 and 383. Replacement of these residues by Arg (RRS(K147R,K383R)), creates a SUMO conjugation resistant variant (RRS(SCR)). Transgenic Drosophila lines for RRS(WT) and RRS(SCR) were generated by expressing these variants in a RRS loss of function (lof) animal, using the UAS-Gal4 system. The RRS-lof line was itself generated using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. Expression of both RRS(WT) and RRS(SCR) rescue the RRS-lof lethality. Adult animals expressing RRS(WT) and RRS(SCR) are compared and contrasted for their response to bacterial infection by gram positive M. luteus and gram negative Ecc15. We find that RRS(SCR), when compared to RRS(WT), shows modulation of the transcriptional response, as measured by quantitative 3′ mRNA sequencing. Our study uncovers a possible non-canonical role for SUMOylation of RRS, a member of the MARS complex, in host-defense.","Nayak, Prajna; Kejriwal, Aarti; Ratnaparkhi, Girish S.",Front Cell Dev Biol,148,31

To assess the effect of this method, we randomly assigned the patients into two groups, based on the location of the grounding pad, and compared the outcomes. RESULTS The ablation time until two roll-offs was shorter in the Back group than in the Thigh group (median, 2.5 min vs 3.4 min; P = 0.01). The ablated area was larger in the Back group than that in the Thigh group (P = 0.01) and pain was less in the Back group (P = 0.02). No severe side-effects were observed in either group. CONCLUSION This new method is useful in that it achieved shorter ablation times, expansion of the ablated areas, and reduction of pain during the ablation.","Nouso, Kazuhiro; Oonishi, Ayano; Wakuta, Akiko; Kariyama, Kazuya",Hepatology research : the official journal of the Japan Society of Hepatology,148,30

DESIGN This 5-week split-faced, double-blind, randomized controlled trial involved 30 subjects with diffuse facial AK who received twice daily 5-FU treatment for 2 weeks. This was followed by pre-randomized twice daily use of one of three topical interventions on one half of the face. TEWL, pH, and hydration were assessed on each quadrant of the face at all visits. Additionally, photographs were subjectively graded by three blinded trained observers. RESULTS Thirty subjects were enrolled, and had an average 27.1 (SD 11.8, range: 13-62) palpable AKs at baseline. Average resolution of baseline AK count was 98.1% by week 4. Clobetasol propionate is best at decreasing TEWL (p = .034), while petrolatum jelly most significantly improves hydration (p = .019) and erythema (p = .014). Though controlled release skin barrier emulsion trended towards improvement in TEWL (p = .17) and hydration (p = .19), there was no significant decrease in erythema (p = .257).

The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical manifestations and CT features of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia in 15 pregnant women and to provide some initial evidence that can be used for guiding treatment of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS. We reviewed the clinical data and CT examinations of 15 consecutive pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia in our hospital from January 20, 2020, to February 10, 2020. A semiquantitative CT scoring system was used to estimate pulmonary involvement and the time course of changes on chest CT. Symptoms and laboratory results were analyzed, treatment experiences were summarized, and clinical outcomes were tracked. RESULTS. Eleven patients had successful delivery (10 cesarean deliveries and one vaginal delivery) during the study period, and four patients were still pregnant (three in the second trimester and one in the third trimester) at the end of the study period. No cases of neonatal asphyxia, neonatal death, stillbirth, or abortion were reported. The most common early finding on chest CT was ground-glass opacity (GGO). With disease progression, crazy paving pattern and consolidations were seen on CT. The abnormalities showed absorptive changes at the end of the study period for all patients. The most common onset symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were fever (13/15 patients) and cough (9/15 patients). The most common abnormal laboratory finding was lymphocytopenia (12/15 patients). CT images obtained before and after delivery showed no signs of pneumonia aggravation after delivery. The four patients who were still pregnant at the end of the study period were not treated with antiviral drugs but had achieved good recovery. CONCLUSION. Pregnancy and childbirth did not aggravate the course of symptoms or CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia. All the cases of COVID-19 pneumonia in the pregnant women in our study were the mild type. All the women in this study-some of whom did not receive antiviral drugs-achieved good recovery from COVID-19 pneumonia.","Liu, Dehan; Li, Lin; Wu, Xin; Zheng, Dandan; Wang, Jiazheng; Yang, Lian; Zheng, Chuansheng",AJR.

Wide surgical resection, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy are the most common sarcoma treatments. However, sarcomas' response rates to chemotherapy are quite low and sarcoma cells can have intrinsic or acquired resistance after treatment with chemotherapeutics drugs, leading to the development of multi-drug resistance (MDR). Cancer cellular plasticity plays pivotal roles in cancer initiation, progression, therapy resistance and cancer relapse. Moreover, cancer cellular plasticity can be regulated by a multitude of factors, such as genetic and epigenetic alterations, tumor microenvironment (TME) or selective pressure imposed by treatment. Recent studies have demonstrated that cellular plasticity is involved in sarcoma progression and chemoresistance. It's essential to understand the molecular mechanisms of cellular plasticity as well as its roles in sarcoma progression and drug resistance. Therefore, this review focuses on the regulatory mechanisms and pathological roles of these diverse cellular plasticity programs in sarcoma.

The efficacy and reliability of these assays are of paramount importance in both tracking and controlling spread of the virus. Real-time RT-PCR assays rely on a fixed genetic sequence for primers and probe binding. Mutations can potentially alter the accuracy of these assays and lead to unpredictable analytical performance characteristics and false-negative results. Herein, we identify a G-to-U transversion (nucleotide 26372) in the SARS-CoV-2 E gene in three specimens with reduced viral detection efficiency using a widely available commercial assay. Further analysis of the public GISAID repository led to the identification of 18 additional genomes with this mutation, which reflect five independent mutational events. This work supports the use of dual-target assays to reduce the number of false-negative PCR results.","Tahan, Stephen; Parikh, Bijal A; Droit, Lindsay; Wallace, Meghan A; Burnham, C A; Wang, David",Journal of clinical microbiology,148,19

Consumers actually increased their consumption of beef slightly after the news of an increased risk from mad cow disease, which has been interpreted as public support for beef farmers and confidence in government regulators. The Canadian public showed a markedly different reaction to the news of domestic BSE than the furious and panicked responses observed in the United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan. Using the social amplification of risk framework, we show that, while other countries displayed social amplification of risk, Canada experienced a social attenuation of risk. The attenuated reaction in Canada toward mad cow disease and increased human health risks from variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) was due to the social context at the time when BSE was discovered domestically. Mortality, morbidity, and psychosocial impacts resulting from other major events such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), West Nile virus (WNV), and the U.S.-Iraq war made the theoretical risks of BSE and vCJD a lower priority, reducing its concern as a risk issue.","Lewis, Roxanne E; Tyshenko, Michael G",Risk analysis : an official publication of the Society for Risk Analysis,148,1

Methods From January 2014 to December 2017, 22 patients who underwent robotic procedure were classified as Group 1, and 34 patients who underwent the same laparoscopic procedure as Group 2. In addition, from September 2009 to July 2011, 13 patients who underwent laparoscopic procedure were classified as Group 3. The perioperative outcomes and short-term postoperative morbidity levels were evaluated in three groups. Results In all groups, there were more women than men, and the mean age and BMI did not differ significantly. Since 2014, jejunojejunostomy was performed extracorporeally and the mean operation time was shorter in Group 1 (258.5±52.9 min) and Group 2 (236.2±62.9 min) than Group 3 (395.2±85.9 min). [p=0.00 (1 vs 3), 0.00 (2 vs 3)] The median hospital stay was 7 days in Group 1 and 2, and shorter than 9 days in Group 3. [p=0.00 (1 vs 3), 0.011 (2 vs 3)] In Group 1, there were three postoperative complications, which included cholangitis, bile leakage and umbilical herniation, respectively). In Group 2, there were seven of postoperative complications, which included choledochojejunostomy site stricture & intrahepatic duct stone, choledochojejunostomy site stone, jejunal branch bleeding, portal vein thrombus, acute pancreatitis, adhesive ileus, and A-loop syndrome. In Group 3, there were three of postoperative complications, which included 2 hepaticojejunostomy site stricture and 1 paralytic ileus. Conclusions Robot-assisted resection of a choledochal cyst with Roux-en-y hepaticojejunostomy is a safe and feasible approach with short-term results that are comparable to those of laparoscopic surgery.","Han, Jang Hun; Lee, Jae Hoon; Hwang, Dae Wook; Song, Ki Byung; Shin, Sang Hyun; Kwon, Jae Woo; Lee, Young Joo; Kim, Song Cheol; Park, Kwang Min",Annals of hepato-biliary-pancreatic surgery,148,17

Neuromuscular adaptations in elite swimmers during concurrent strength and endurance training at low and moderate altitudes. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2020-This study evaluated neuromuscular adaptations in elite swimmers during concurrent strength and endurance training (SET) at low (295 m) and moderate (2,320 m) altitudes. Sixteen elite swimmers took part in a 3-week SET during a general preparation phase. All neuromuscular tests were performed a week before and after a SET. In posttraining, maximal knee isometric torque (TMVC) and soleus H-reflex remained statistically unchanged for sea-level (SL) and for altitude (AL) training. Rate of torque development (RTD) decreased post-SL (-14.5%; p < 0.01) but not post-AL (-4.7%; p > 0.05) training. Vastus lateralis electromyographic (EMG) activity during RTD decreased post-SL (-17.0%; P = 0.05) but not post-AL (4.8%; p > 0.05) training. Quadriceps twitch torque (TTW) significantly increased post-AL (12.1%; p < 0.01) but not post-SL (-1.0%; p > 0.05; training × altitude: F1,15 = 12.4; p < 0.01) training. Quadriceps twitch contraction time and M-wave amplitude remained statistically unchanged post-SL and post-AL training. After SL training, increment in TMVC was accompanied with increment in vastus lateralis EMG (R = 0.76; p < 0.01) and TTW (R = 0.48; p < 0.06). Posttraining in AL, increment in TMVC was accompanied with increment in TTW (R = 0.54; p < 0.05). Strength and endurance training at altitude seems to prompt adaptations in twitch contractile properties. In contrast, SET performed at SL may hamper the magnitude of neural adaptations to strength training, particularly during rapid voluntary contractions. In conclusion, SET at AL might benefit muscular adaptations in swimmers compared with training at SL.","Tomazin, Katja; Strojnik, Vojko; Feriche, Belen; Garcia Ramos, Amador; Štrumbelj, Boro; Stirn, Igor",Journal of strength and conditioning research,148,1

The blood-brain barrier (BBB) plays an important role in restricting neuroinvasion of peripheral leukocytes and virus, thereby regulating the progression of viral encephalitis. In this study, we explored the role of CD11c(hi) dendritic cells (DCs) in regulating BBB integrity and JE progression using a conditional depletion model of CD11c(hi) DCs. Transient ablation of CD11c(hi) DCs resulted in markedly increased susceptibility to JE progression along with highly increased neuro-invasion of JEV. In addition, exacerbated JE progression in CD11c(hi) DC-ablated hosts was closely associated with increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IFN-β, IL-6, and TNF-α) and CC chemokines (CCL2, CCL3, CXCL2) in the brain. Moreover, our results revealed that the exacerbation of JE progression in CD11c(hi) DC-ablated hosts was correlated with enhanced BBB permeability and reduced expression of tight junction and adhesion molecules (claudin-5, ZO-1, occluding, JAMs). Ultimately, our data conclude that the ablation of CD11c(hi) DCs provided a subsidiary impact on BBB integrity and the expression of tight junction/adhesion molecules, thereby leading to exacerbated JE progression. These findings provide insight into the secondary role of CD11c(hi) DCs in JE progression through regulation of BBB integrity and the expression of tight junction/adhesion molecules.","Kim, Jin Hyoung; Hossain, Ferdaus Mohd Altaf; Patil, Ajit Mahadev; Choi, Jin Young; Kim, Seong Bum; Uyangaa, Erdenebelig; Park, Sang-Youel; Lee, John-Hwa; Kim, Bumseok; Kim, Koanhoi; Eo, Seong Kug","Comparative immunology, microbiology and infectious diseases",148,5

Here, we report that topical treatment with mastoparan, a peptide MC activator (MCA), enhances clearance of Staphylococcus aureus from infected mouse skins and accelerates healing of dermonecrotic lesions. Mastoparan functions by activating connective tissue MCs (CTMCs) via the MRGPRX2 (Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor member X2) receptor. Peripheral CTMC activation, in turn, enhances recruitment of bacteria-clearing neutrophils and wound-healing CD301b+ dendritic cells. Consistent with MCs playing a master coordinating role, MC activation also augmented migration of various antigen-presenting dendritic cells to draining lymph nodes, leading to stronger protection against a second infection challenge. MCAs therefore orchestrate both the innate and adaptive immune arms, which could potentially be applied to combat peripheral infections by a broad range of pathogens.","Arifuzzaman, Mohammad; Mobley, Yuvon R; Choi, Hae Woong; Bist, Pradeep; Salinas, Cristina A; Brown, Zachary D; Chen, Swaine L; Staats, Herman F; Abraham, Soman N",Science advances,148,1

To restrict the transmission of SVA, an establishment of an effective diagnostic method is crucial for the prevention and control of the disease. However, traditional detection methods often have many drawbacks. In this study, reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) was combined with a lateral flow dipstick (LFD) to detect SVA. The resulting RT-LAMP-LFD assay was performed at 60°C for 50 min and then directly judged on an LFD visualization strip. This method shows high specificity and sensitivity to SVA. The detection limit of RT-LAMP was 4.56x10-8 ng/μL RNA, approximately 11 copies/μL RNA, and it was 10 times more sensitive than RT-PCR. This detection method's positive rate for clinical samples is comparable to that of RT-PCR. This method is time saving and highly efficient and is thus expected to be used to diagnose SVA infections in this field.","Li, Jinhui; Liang, Weifang; Xu, Shuaifei; Shi, Jian; Zhou, Xia; Liu, Bowen; Yu, Li; Xiong, Jingfeng; Si, Guangbin; He, Dongsheng",PloS one,148,16

Neuroticism, impaired cognitive control, and blunted reward learning may be critical processes involved in MDD and may help to explain symptoms of anxiety and anhedonia. METHODS Using baseline data from patients with early-onset MDD (N = 296) in the Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response in Clinical Care (EMBARC) trial, we conducted a path analysis to model relationships between neuroticism, cognitive control, and reward learning to levels of anxiety and anhedonia. RESULTS Neuroticism was positively associated with both anhedonia (standardized coefficient = 0.26, p < .001) and anxiety (standardized coefficient = 0.40, p < .001). Cognitive control was negatively associated with anxiety (standardized coefficient = -0.18, p < .05). Reward learning was not significantly associated with either anxiety or anhedonia. LIMITATIONS Extraneous variables not included in the model may have even more influence in explaining symptoms of anxiety and anhedonia. Restricted range in these variables may have attenuated some of the hypothesized relationships. Most important, because this was a cross-sectional analysis in a currently depressed sample, we cannot draw any causal conclusions without experimental and longitudinal data.

Secondary outcomes were general population mortality and risk of death in-hospital, reported as weekly mortality rate ratios (MRRs). RESULTS From 2 438 286 attendances in the study period, overall unplanned attendances decreased by up to 21%; attendances excluding COVID-19 were reduced by 31%; non-psychiatric by 31% and psychiatric by 30%. Out of the five most common diagnoses expected to remain stable, only schizophrenia and myocardial infarction remained stable, while chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation, hip fracture and urinary tract infection fell significantly. The nationwide general population MRR rose in six of the recorded weeks, while MRR excluding patients who were COVID-19 positive only increased in two. CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic and a governmental national 'shelter at home' order was associated with a marked reduction in unplanned hospital attendances with an increase in MRR for the general population in two of 7 weeks, despite exclusion of patients with COVID-19. The findings should be taken into consideration when planning for public information campaigns.","Bogh, Søren Bie; Fløjstrup, Marianne; Nissen, Søren Kabell; Hanson, Stine; Bech, Mickael; Johnsen, Søren Paaske; Kristensen, Mette Rahbek; Laugesen, Line Emilie; Søndergaard, Jens; Folkestad, Lars; Christensen, Erika Frischknecht; Henriksen, Daniel Pilsgaard; Hsia, Renee Y; Graham, Colin A; Lindskou, Tim Alex; Byg, Keld-Erik; Søvsø, Morten Breinholt; Laugesen, Henrik; Hallas, Peter; Mikkelsen, Søren; Olsen, Kim Rose; Thygesen, Lau Caspar; Gamst-Jensen, Hejdi; Brabrand, Mikkel",BMJ quality & safety,148,30

Sleep disturbances are complex and caused by several factors and are difficult to treat. There is a need for more robust and systematic studies dealing with sleep disturbances in older people with dementia. The aim of this study was to investigate effects from robot-assisted (Paro) group activity on sleep patterns in nursing home (NH) residents with dementia. DESIGN A cluster randomized controlled trial. SETTING Special care units in 10 NH in Norway. PARTICIPANTS A total of 60 participants over 65 years with dementia were recruited. Thirty participants were recruited to the intervention group and 30 participants to the control group. INTERVENTION Participants participated in group activity with Paro for 30 minutes twice a week over 12 weeks or in control group (treatment as usual). MEASUREMENTS Sleep-wake patterns were assessed objectively by 7 days of wrist actigraphy before and after the intervention. Data were collected between March 2013 and September 2014. Data were analyzed using mixed models. RESULTS Positive effects on change in sleep were found in the intervention group as compared with the control group. The intervention group increased percentage of sleep efficiency, increased the amount of total sleep time and reduced number of nocturnal awakenings. In addition, a significant effect was found in reduced awakenings after sleep onset. CONCLUSIONS Social stimulation through engaging group activity could contribute to improved sleep in people with dementia in NH. Increased sleep efficiency and total sleep time, in addition to fewer night awakenings, affect central indicators of good sleep quality across the life span. Improved sleep quality will also affect quality of life and comorbidities in vulnerable groups. We believe group activity with Paro to be an accessible and feasible non-pharmacological treatment for those who enjoy Paro.","Jøranson, Nina; Olsen, Christine; Calogiuri, Giovanna; Ihlebæk, Camilla; Pedersen, Ingeborg",International psychogeriatrics,148,17

However, the relationship between flexibility, which is a component of physical fitness, and the incidence of hypertension is unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between flexibility and the incidence of hypertension in a cohort study. A total of 22,972 (14,805 men and 8167 women; median age 49 years) normotensive participants were included in this study. Between April 2001 and March 2002, flexibility (standing forward bending) was measured using a standing trunk flexion meter. The participants were divided into quartiles of flexibility by sex and age group. Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mm Hg, or a self-reported history of previously diagnosed hypertension or current medication for hypertension at a health examination between April, 2002 and March, 2008. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for the incidence of hypertension were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, exercise habits, smoking status, and drinking status. During 102,948 person years of follow-up (median 5.6 years), 4235 participants developed hypertension. Compared with the lowest flexibility (quartile 1), hazard ratios and 95% CI were 0.96 (0.88-1.04) for quartile 2, 0.94 (0.86-1.03) for quartile 3, and 0.83 (0.76-0.91) for quartile 4.

As the prognosis of organ failure improves with early treatment, it is important to identify these patients as early as possible. Most studies on organ failure have been performed in intensive care settings, or on selected groups of patients, where a high prevalence and mortality have been reported. Before patients arrive to the intensive care unit, or the general ward, most of them have passed through the emergency department (ED), where diagnosis and treatment has been initiated. The prevalence and prognosis of acutely ill patients, with organ failure, at arrival have been studied in some selected groups, but methods and results differ. This systematic review aims to identify, summarize, and analyze studies of prevalence and prognosis of new onset organ failure in acutely ill undifferentiated patients, at arrival to hospital. The result of the review will assist physicians working in an ED, when assessing patients' risk of organ failure and their associated prognosis. METHODS The information sources used are electronic databases, PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and CINAHL; references in included studies and review articles; and authors' personal files. One author will perform the title and abstract screening and exclude obviously ineligible studies. By an independent full-text screening, two authors will decide on the eligibility for the remaining studies. Eligible studies will include an unselected group of acutely ill adult patients at arrival to hospital, with one or more organ failures (respiratory, renal, cerebral, circulatory, hepatic, or coagulation failure). Included studies will have assessed the prevalence or prognosis, defined as mortality or ICU transfer, of new onset organ failure. From included studies, bibliographical and study description data, patient characteristics, and data related to prevalence of organ failure and prognosis will be extracted. We will assess risk of bias in included studies using the Quality in Prognosis Studies tool for prognostic studies and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for observational studies. We expect heterogeneity and to conduct a qualitative synthesis of the results. If, however, heterogeneity is low, we will conduct a random effects meta-analysis stratified by basic study design. DISCUSSION This review will summarize and analyze studies of prevalence and prognosis of acutely ill patients, with organ failure at arrival to hospital, assist ED physicians assessing the risk of organ failure in unselected patients, and guide recommendations for further research.

METHODS Six patients suffering from recurrent and complicated incisional hernias underwent a hybrid technique for their repair. The open part of the operation ensured extensive and safe adhesiolysis, reduction of the hernia content into the peritoneal cavity, and proper placement of the bowel loops into the peritoneal cavity, minimizing the risk of bowel perforation. For the laparoscopic part of the procedure, intraperitoneal (underlay) e-PTFE mesh placement, of the appropriate size covering the actual hernia size and the scar edges for at least 3 cm, was laparoscopically fixated by transfascial stay stitches, allowing stretch of the mesh on the anterior abdominal wall, probably avoiding the mesh deformation in the future. RESULTS The overall size of the fascial defect was calculated between 116 and 187 cm, the size of the mesh used ranged from 308 to 468 cm, the total operative time ranged from 128 to 207 minutes and within a maximum follow-up period of 12 months, all patients are asymptomatic without any evidence of hernia recurrence. CONCLUSIONS The hybrid technique is safe in cases of recurrent or complicated or difficult incisional hernias. A longer follow-up period is required to estimating the effectiveness and the cost-effectiveness of the method.","Griniatsos, John; Yiannakopoulou, Eugenia; Tsechpenakis, Anastasios; Tsigris, Christos; Diamantis, Theodoros","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",148,1

However, there are limited large series of patients undergoing MIE from the United States and no standardized approach. We reviewed our experience with MIE utilizing a stapled side-to-side anastomosis during a 7.5-year period. STUDY DESIGN A retrospective review of prospectively maintained databases for patients undergoing planned esophagectomy were reviewed from 2007 to 2015. Esophagogastric anastomoses were performed via a 6-cm linear stapled side-to-side method. Demographics, comorbidities, surgical approach, pathology data, and postoperative morbidities were recorded and reviewed. RESULTS A MIE was attempted in 303 of 315 (96 %) patients, and a total minimally invasive approach was completed in 293 of 315 (93 %) patients. Location of anastomosis was predominantly in the neck, with 244 patients (77.5 %) undergoing a total minimally invasive McKeown approach (n = 231). A total, minimally invasive Ivor-Lewis was completed in 60 patients (19.1 %). Anastomotic leak was identified in 24 patients (7.6 %). Rates of anastomotic leak were 4.4 % for Ivor-Lewis and 8.5 % for McKeown resection. Median length of stay was 8 days, and in-hospital mortality occurred in only three patients (n = 1 %). Ninety-day follow-up demonstrated a 4.1 % stricture rate requiring dilatation. CONCLUSIONS In the Western patient population, MIE utilizing a 6-cm stapled side-to-side anastomosis is associated with low rates of anastomotic leak, stricture, and mortality.","Ben-David, Kfir; Tuttle, Rebecca; Kukar, Moshim; Rossidis, Georgios; Hochwald, Steven N",Annals of surgical oncology,148,16

This study compared the efficacy and safety of two DEX-sparing regimens with 3-day DEX, focusing on delayed nausea. PATIENTS AND METHODS This open-label, randomized, phase III study was designed to demonstrate noninferiority of two DEX-sparing regimens: ondansetron + DEX on day 1, metoclopramide on days 2-3 (MCP arm), and palonosetron + DEX on day 1 (PAL arm) to ondansetron on day 1 + DEX on days 1-3 (DEX arm) in chemotherapy-naïve patients receiving MEC. Primary efficacy endpoint was total control (TC; no emetic episodes, no use of rescue medication, no nausea) in the delayed phase. Noninferiority was defined as a lower 95% CI greater than the noninferiority margin set at -20%. Secondary endpoints included no vomiting, no rescue medication, no (significant) nausea, impact of CINV on quality of life, antiemetics-associated side-effects. RESULTS Treatment arms were comparable for 189 patients analyzed: predominantly male (55.7%); median age 65.0 years; colorectal cancer (85.7%); oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy (81.5%). MCP demonstrated noninferiority to DEX for delayed TC [MCP 56.1% versus DEX 50.0%, 95% CI (-11.3%, 23.5%)]. PAL also demonstrated noninferiority to DEX [PAL 55.6% versus DEX 50.0%, 95% CI (-12.0%, 23.2%)]. There were no statistically significant differences for all secondary endpoints between treatment arms. CONCLUSION This study showed that DEX-sparing regimens are noninferior to multiple-day DEX in terms of delayed TC rate in patients undergoing MEC. TRIAL REGISTRATION This study was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (number: NCT02135510). IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in the delayed phase (24-120 hr post-chemotherapy) remains one of the most troublesome adverse effects associated with cancer treatment. In particular, delayed nausea is often poorly controlled. The role of dexamethasone (DEX) in the prevention of delayed nausea after moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC) is controversial. Our study is the first to include nausea assessment as a part of the primary study outcome to better gauge the effectiveness of CINV control and patients' experience. We show that a DEX-sparing strategy does not result in any significant loss of overall antiemetic control: DEX-sparing strategies incorporating palonosetron or multiple-day metoclopramide are safe and at least as effective as standard treatment with a 3-day DEX regimen with ondansetron in controlling delayed CINV - and nausea in particular - following MEC.","van der Vorst, Maurice J D L; Toffoli, Elisa C; Beusink, Marlien; van Linde, Myra E; van Voorthuizen, Theo; Brouwer, Saskia; van Zweeden, Annette A; Vrijaldenhoven, Suzan; Berends, Johan C; Berkhof, Johannes; Verheul, Henk M W",The oncologist,148,30

However, associations between specific programme indicators and key clinical endpoints, such as emergency hospital admissions, remain unclear. We aimed to examine whether attainment of Quality and Outcomes Framework and National Diabetes Audit primary care diabetes indicators is associated with diabetes-related, cardiovascular, and all-cause emergency hospital admissions. DESIGN Historical cohort study. SETTING A total of 330 English primary care practices, 2010-2017, using UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink. PARTICIPANTS A total of 84,441 adults with type 2 diabetes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was emergency hospital admission for any cause. Secondary outcomes were (1) diabetes-related and (2) cardiovascular-related emergency admission. RESULTS There were 130,709 all-cause emergency admissions, 115,425 diabetes-related admissions and 105,191 cardiovascular admissions, corresponding to unplanned admission rates of 402, 355 and 323 per 1000 patient-years, respectively. All-cause hospital admission rates were lower among those who met HbA1c and cholesterol indicators (incidence rate ratio = 0.91; 95% CI 0.89-0.92; p < 0.001 and 0.87; 95% CI 0.86-0.89; p < 0.001), respectively), with similar findings for diabetes and cardiovascular admissions. Patients who achieved the Quality and Outcomes Framework blood pressure target had lower cardiovascular admission rates (incidence rate ratio = 0.98; 95% CI 0.96-0.99; p = 0.001). Strong associations were found between completing 7-9 (vs. either 4-6 or 0-3) National Diabetes Audit processes and lower rates of all admission outcomes (p-values < 0.001), and meeting all nine National Diabetes Audit processes had significant associations with reductions in all types of emergency admissions by 22% to 26%. Meeting the HbA1c or cholesterol Quality and Outcomes Framework indicators, or completing 7-9 National Diabetes Audit processes, was also associated with longer time-to-unplanned all-cause, diabetes and cardiovascular admissions. CONCLUSIONS Attaining Quality and Outcomes Framework-defined diabetes intermediate outcome thresholds, and comprehensive completion of care processes, may translate into considerable reductions in emergency hospital admissions. Out-of-hospital diabetes care optimisation is needed to improve implementation of core interventions and reduce unplanned admissions.","Gunn, Laura H; McKay, Ailsa J; Molokhia, Mariam; Valabhji, Jonathan; Molina, German; Majeed, Azeem; Vamos, Eszter P",Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine,148,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS This analysis included test results from men ≥ 40 years, without prior International Classification of Diseases-10 record of prostate cancer since January 2016, who received PSA or prostate biopsy testing at Quest Diagnostics during January 2018-December 2020. Monthly trends were evaluated for three periods: prepandemic (January 2018-February 2020), early-pandemic (March-May 2020), and late-pandemic (June-December 2020). RESULTS Meeting inclusion criteria were 16,365,833 PSA and 48,819 prostate biopsy results. The average monthly number of PSA tests declined from 465,187 prepandemic to 295,786 early-pandemic (36.4% decrease; P = .01) before rebounding to 483,374 (3.9% increase; P = .23) late-pandemic.

METHODS Compression analysis was performed with a foam pad/sensor apparatus inserted between closed jaws of the instruments. Average pressures (psi) were recorded across the entire inside surface of the jaws, and over the distal one-third of jaws. To test vessel sealing strength, ex vivo pig carotid arteries were sealed and transected and left and right (sealed) halves of vessels were subjected to burst pressure testing. The maximum bursting pressures of each half of vessels were averaged to obtain single data points for analysis. The absence or presence of tissue sticking to device jaws was noted for each transected vessel. RESULTS Statistically higher average compression values were found for ENSEAL(®) instruments (curved jaw and straight jaw) compared to LigaSure™, P<0.05. Moreover, the ENSEAL(®) devices retained full compression at the distal end of jaws. Significantly higher and more consistent median burst pressures were noted for ENSEAL(®) devices relative to LigaSure™ through 52 firings of each device (P<0.05). LigaSure™ showed a significant reduction in median burst pressure for the final three firings (cycles 50-52) versus the first three firings (cycles 1-3), P=0.027. Tissue sticking was noted for 1.39% and 13.3% of vessels transected with ENSEAL(®) and LigaSure™, respectively.

The viral replication machinery consists of four nonstructural proteins (nsP1-4) produced as a single polyprotein. Processing of the polyprotein occurs in a highly regulated manner, with cleavage at the P2/3 junction influencing RNA template use during genome replication. Here, we report the structure of P23 in a precleavage form. The proteins form an extensive interface and nsP3 creates a ring structure that encircles nsP2. The P2/3 cleavage site is located at the base of a narrow cleft and is not readily accessible, suggesting a highly regulated cleavage. The nsP2 protease active site is over 40 Å away from the P2/3 cleavage site, supporting a trans cleavage mechanism. nsP3 contains a previously uncharacterized protein fold with a zinc-coordination site. Known mutations in nsP2 that result in formation of noncytopathic viruses or a temperature sensitive phenotype cluster at the nsP2/nsP3 interface. Structure-based mutations in nsP3 opposite the location of the nsP2 noncytopathic mutations prevent efficient cleavage of P23, affect RNA infectivity, and alter viral RNA production levels, highlighting the importance of the nsP2/nsP3 interaction in pathogenesis. A potential RNA-binding surface, spanning both nsP2 and nsP3, is proposed based on the location of ion-binding sites and adaptive mutations. These results offer unexpected insights into viral protein processing and pathogenesis that may be applicable to other polyprotein-encoding viruses such as HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and Dengue virus.","Shin, Gyehwa; Yost, Samantha A; Miller, Matthew T; Elrod, Elizabeth J; Grakoui, Arash; Marcotrigiano, Joseph",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,148,31

Many viral polypeptides modulate apoptosis by direct interaction with highly conserved apoptotic pathways. Some viruses induce apoptosis during late stages of the infection cycle, while others inhibit apoptosis to facilitate replication or maintain persistent infection. In previous work, we showed that Chilo iridescent virus (CIV) or CIV virion protein extract induces apoptosis in spruce budworm and cotton boll weevil cell cultures. Here, we characterize the product of a CIV gene (iridovirus serine/threonine kinase; istk) with signature sequences for S/T kinase and ATP binding. ISTK appears to belong to the superfamily, vaccinia-related kinases (VRKs). The istk gene was expressed in Pichia pastoris vectors. Purified ISTK (48 kDa) exhibited S/T kinase activity. Treatment with ISTK induced apoptosis in budworm cells. A 35-kDa cleavage product of ISTK retaining key signature sequences was identified during purification. Pichia-expressed 35-kDa polypeptide, designated iridoptin, induced apoptosis and inhibition of host protein synthesis in budworm and boll weevil cells. A mutation in the ATP-binding site eliminated both kinase and apoptosis activity of iridoptin, suggesting that kinase activity is essential for induction of apoptosis. Analysis with custom antibody confirmed that ISTK is a structural component of CIV particles. This is the first demonstration of a viral kinase inducing apoptosis in any virus-host system and the first identification of a factor inducing apoptosis or host protein shutoff for the family Iridoviridae.","Chitnis, Nilesh S; Paul, Eric R; Lawrence, Paulraj K; Henderson, Curtis W; Ganapathy, Saranya; Taylor, Patrick V; Virdi, Kamaldeep S; D'Costa, Susan M; May, Ashley R; Bilimoria, Shan L",Journal of virology,148,16

Many available techniques are invasive and involve extensive surgery. A local procedure with good closure rates would be preferable as a first step in the treatment of RVF. The aim of this study was the development of a local technique for the closure of RVF with good closure rates to prevent the use of more invasive procedures. METHODS This was a pilot study. Patients with RVF who had undergone multiple operations in the pelvic area, local radiotherapy, chemotherapy or had been diagnosed with Crohn's disease were included in the study. All had a history of surgery for RVF. A cross-linked collagen matrix biomesh was placed in the rectovaginal septum using a transperineal or a transvaginal approach. The main outcome measure in this study was the closure rate reported as absence of the fistula at 1 year. RESULTS Twelve patients were included in the study. Absence of fistula at 1 year was 0.64 (95 % confidence interval 0.30-0.85). Three patients (25.0 %) developed a recurrence, two were reoperated on with a gracilis flap transposition, and one was treated with laparoscopic ligation. In one patient (8.3 %), the fistula failed to close within 3 months after the mesh placement. CONCLUSIONS Our technique shows promising results. A local and simple technique with acceptable closure and morbidity rates, like our local repair with biomesh, would be ideal as a first step in treating RVFs. Long-term results are needed.","Göttgens, K W A; Heemskerk, J; van Gemert, W; Smeets, R; Stassen, L P S; Beets, G; Baeten, C G M I; Breukink, S O",Techniques in coloproctology,148,1

For patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy regimens at our institution in the ambulatory infusion center, palonosetron was selected as the preferred serotonin (5-HT3) antagonist for CINV prophylaxis per the 2016 NCCN Guidelines, when a neurokinin1 antagonist was not included in the prophylactic regimen. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of dexamethasone and palonosetron versus granisetron for the prevention of CINV in patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy regimens. METHODS This study is an Institutional Review Board-approved, single-center retrospective review of electronic health records including patients who received moderately emetogenic chemotherapy regimens with CINV prophylaxis with dexamethasone and either palonosetron or granisetron. RESULTS A total of 268 eligible patients were included in the study. Eighty-eight patients received palonosetron and 180 patients received granisetron as their 5-HT3 receptor antagonist between October 31, 2014 and October 31, 2016. There were no statistically significant differences between the two antiemetic groups for the primary outcome of presence of any change in day 1 intravenous prophylactic antiemetics. Nine (10.23%) palonosetron patients and 15 (8.33%) granisetron patients required a change in their day 1 intravenous prophylactic antiemetics (P = 0.610). CONCLUSIONS Despite palonosetron's better efficacy, longer half-life, and higher binding affinity, the results of this retrospective review demonstrates that the choice of serotonin antagonist, palonosetron or granisetron, did not result in a change in day 1 intravenous prophylactic antiemetics or antiemetic outpatient medications for patients undergoing moderately emetogenic chemotherapy regimens.","Gamble, Melissa; Carroll, Elisabeth; Wright, Garth C; Glode, Ashley E",Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,148,12

An important feature of GATases is the strong stimulation of glutaminase activity by the associated synthase. To understand the mechanism of this tight activity regulation, we probed by site-directed mutagenesis four residues of the glutaminase subunit TrpG from anthranilate synthase that are located between the catalytic Cys-His-Glu triad and the synthase subunit TrpE. In order to minimize structural perturbations induced by the introduced exchanges, the amino acids from TrpG were substituted with the corresponding residues of the closely related glutaminase HisH from imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase. Steady-state kinetic characterization showed that, in contrast to wild-type TrpG, two TrpG variants with single exchanges constitutively hydrolyzed glutamine in the absence of TrpE. A reaction assay performed with hydroxylamine as a stronger nucleophile replacing water and a filter assay with radiolabeled glutamine indicated that the formation of the thioester intermediate is the rate-limiting step of constitutive glutamine hydrolysis. Molecular dynamics simulations with wild-type TrpG and constitutively active TrpG variants suggest that the introduced amino acid exchanges result in a distance reduction between the active site Cys-His pair, which facilitates the deprotonation of the sulfhydryl group of the catalytic cysteine and thus enables its nucleophilic attack onto the carboxamide group of the glutamine side chain. We propose that native TrpG in the anthranilate synthase complex is activated by a similar mechanism.","List, Felix; Bocola, Marco; Haeger, Michaela C; Sterner, Reinhard",Biochemistry,148,1

However, limited information exists about the effectiveness of wound closure using these sutures. OBJECTIVES The authors compare closure times and clinical outcomes of 2-layer wound closure using V-Loc 90 barbed sutures (Covidien, Inc, Mansfield, Massachusetts) with conventional, 3-layer closure with nonbarbed, nonlocking sutures. METHODS The lipoabdominoplasty wounds of 30 consecutive patients were divided into 2 equal halves, and the control and study halves of the wound were randomly assigned for each patient. On the control side, a conventional 3-layer wound closure (Scarpa's fascia, deep dermis, and upper dermis) was performed using polyglactin 910 and polyglecaprone 25 sutures. On the study side, the wound was closed in 2 layers (Scarpa's fascia and upper dermis) using a running suture of V-Loc 90 sutures. Closure of each layer and of the entire half of the wound was performed by a single surgeon and timed. Patients were followed for an average of 13 months postoperatively. Postoperative complications were recorded and scar appearance was evaluated with the Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS). RESULTS Data were collected from a total of 30 control and 30 study sides. The mean closure time for each layer was faster with barbed sutures than with nonbarbed sutures, and the total average closure time was 4.4 minutes (36.1%) faster using barbed sutures compared with conventional sutures (7.9 vs 12.3 minutes, respectively; P < .0001). Postoperative wound complications occurred in 4 (13.3%) control sides compared with 1 (3.3%) study side of the wound. The VSS scores were similar between the 2 sides. The lateral section of the scar received lower VSS scores than central sections. CONCLUSIONS Two-layer wound closure using V-Loc 90 barbed sutures was safe and faster and resulted in fewer postoperative complications than 3-layer closure with conventional, nonbarbed sutures. V-Loc 90 sutures did not produce better scar cosmesis. Wound closure with barbed sutures may be financially and clinically advantageous in lipoabdominoplasty patients as it requires less wound closure time.

Contrary to a common narrative whereby politics drives susceptibility to fake news, people are 'better' at discerning truth from falsehood (despite greater overall belief) when evaluating politically concordant news. Instead, poor truth discernment is associated with lack of careful reasoning and relevant knowledge, and the use of heuristics such as familiarity. Furthermore, there is a substantial disconnect between what people believe and what they share on social media. This dissociation is largely driven by inattention, more so than by purposeful sharing of misinformation. Thus, interventions can successfully nudge social media users to focus more on accuracy.

Previous studies have focused on using selected HFE tools, but newer literature supports a system-based HFE approach to IPC. RECENT FINDINGS Cross-contamination and the existence of workarounds suggest that healthcare workers need better support to reduce and simplify steps in delivering care. Simplifying workflow can lead to better understanding of why a process fails and allow for improvements to reduce errors and increase efficiency. Hand hygiene can be improved using visual cues and nudges based on room layout. Using personal protective equipment appropriately appears simple, but exists in a complex interaction with workload, behavior, emotion, and environmental variables including product placement. HFE can help prevent the pathogen transmission through improving environmental cleaning and appropriate use of medical devices. SUMMARY Emerging evidence suggests that HFE can be applied in IPC to reduce healthcare-associated infections. HFE and IPC collaboration can help improve many of the basic best practices including use of hand hygiene and personal protective equipment by healthcare workers during patient care.","Jacob, Jesse T; Herwaldt, Loreen A; Durso, Francis T",Current opinion in infectious diseases,148,24

HAIs can prolong the length of stay and increase the hospitalization costs, but only a few studies have been conducted in Sichuan province, China. We evaluated the hospitalization costs and length of stay due to HAI in Sichuan province based on the prevalence survey, and provided data reference for China's medical insurance reform. Methods In the hospitals surveyed on the prevalence of HAI, a multi-center nested case-control study was performed by a paired method. The study period was from 6 September 2016 to 30 November 2016. Binary outcomes were tested using χ2 test, continuous outcomes were tested using Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test, intra-group comparisons were tested using multiple linear regression analysis. Results A total of 225 pairs/450 patients were selected in 51 hospitals, and 170 pairs/350 patients were successfully matched. The case fatality rate was 5.14% for the HAIs patients and 3.43% for non-HAs patients, there was no significant difference (χ2 = 0.627, P = 0.429); the median length of stay in patients with HAIs was 21 days, longer than that of patients with non-HAI 16 days, the median of the difference between matched-pairs was 5 days, the difference was statistically significant (Z = 4.896, P = 0.000). The median hospitalization costs of patients with HAI were €1732.83, higher than that of patients with non-HAI €1095.29, the median of the difference between matched-pairs were €431.34, the difference was statistically significant (Z = 6.413, P = 0.000). Multiple linear regression results showed that HAIs at different sites have caused different economic burdens, but in different economic regions, the difference was not statistically significant. Conclusions In Sichuan, the hospitalization costs and length of stay caused by HAI should be given special attention in the current medical insurance reform. The proportion and scope of medical payment for patients with HAI at different sites should be different. Efforts need to be taken to incentivize reduction of HAI rates which will reduce hospitalization costs and length of stay.","Lü, Yu; Cai, Min Hong; Cheng, Jian; Zou, Kun; Xiang, Qian; Wu, Jia Yu; Wei, Dao Qiong; Zhou, Zhong Hua; Wang, Hui; Wang, Chen; Chen, Jing",Antimicrobial resistance and infection control,148,22

SE status is a strong predictor of premature morbidity and mortality within general health. A lower SE status also has implications of increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality and poorer CVD risk factor profiles. CVD comorbidity is associated with a higher case severity and mortality rate from COVID-19, with both CVD and COVID-19 sharing important risk factors. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected people of a lower SE status and of ethnic minority group, who in the most deprived regions are suffering double the mortality rate of the least deprived. The acute stress, economic recession and quarantine restrictions in the wake of COVID-19 are also predicted to cause a decline in mental health. This could pose substantial increase to CVD incidence, particularly with acute pathologies such as stroke, acute coronary syndrome and cardiogenic shock among lower SE status individuals and vulnerable elderly populations. Efforts to tackle SE status and CVD may aid in reducing avoidable deaths. The implementation of 'upstream' interventions and policies demonstrates promise in achieving the greatest population impact, aiming to protect and empower individuals. Specific measures may involve risk factor targeting restrictions on the availability and advertisement of tobacco, alcohol and high-fat and salt content food, and targeting SE disparity with healthy and secure workplaces.","Naylor-Wardle, Jeremy; Rowland, Ben; Kunadian, Vijay",Heart,148,1

The subjective order of simultaneous events, however, is not only perceptual but also subject to illusions during voluntary actions. Self-initiated actions, for example, seem to precede their sensory outcomes following an adaptation to a delay between the action and the sensory feedback. Here, we demonstrate that the extent of the apparent asynchrony can be substantially reduced when direction change is induced by a voluntary key press following a delay adaptation regime. We also show that the reduced color-motion asynchrony effect size following a motor-sensory recalibration is not a result of a change in the onset of perceived direction change relative to that of the color. This is particularly important as it implies, for the first time in the literature, that voluntary action is not only important in forming action-sensory outcome associations but may also act as a binding factor between the two perceptual features of a sensory event.","Ayhan, Inci; Kurtcan, Melisa; Thorpe, Lucas",Vision research,148,16

The second case involved a 44-year-old man with a history of depression and psychotic symptoms who presented after a serious suicide attempt and tested positive for COVID-19 on admission. The patient had subsequent negative tests while on the inpatient psychiatric unit before again testing positive later in his admission. The patient's positive COVID-19 tests appeared to coincide with exacerbations in his mood symptoms, which led to the suicide attempt and psychotic episode that initially caused his admission. This patient was successfully treated with clozapine. In both of these cases, the question arose as to whether there was a link between the COVID-19 infections and the neuropsychiatric symptoms.

METHODS We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for randomized controlled trials published 1997-2018 reporting BMD, osteoporosis, low bone mass, and/or fractures in treatment-naïve patients taking compared to not taking TDF for 48±4 weeks. We pooled outcomes using DerSimonian random-effects models. RESULTS Our search yielded 5178 abstracts, representing 3865 articles, with 25 meeting the inclusion criteria. TDF was associated with greater BMD decline when taken as PrEP (lumbar spine: mean difference, MD=-0.82%, 95%CI=-1.28,-0.37%, I2=38%; total hip: MD=-0.81%, 95%CI=-1.22,-0.40%, I2=48%) and HIV treatment (lumbar spine: MD=-1.62%, 95%CI=-2.30,-0.95%, I2=93%; total hip: MD=-1.75%, 95%CI=-2.08,-1.42%, I2=83%; femoral neck: MD=-1.26%, 95%CI=-2.15,-0.38%, I2=43%) in comparison to those not taking TDF. Eight studies reported on incident osteoporosis or low bone mass, with variable results. Pooled results from five PrEP studies showed that TDF was not associated with increased fractures compared to no PrEP (RR=1.12, 95%CI=0.752,1.74, I2=26%). CONCLUSIONS TDF caused greater decreases in BMD than did comparators when used for all three indications, and the magnitude of this decrease was larger for HIV treatment compared to PrEP. Fractures were not increased among PrEP patients. The clinically-significant BMD decline caused by TDF and current expansion of PrEP use suggest attention to the adverse bone effects of TDF will increase in importance.","Baranek, Benjamin; Wang, Shaoyuan; Cheung, Angela M; Mishra, Sharmistha; Tan, Darrell Hs",Antiviral therapy,148,12

This is made possible by a good control of the colloidal dispersion at each step of the synthesis. With this aim, we have improved our chemical procedure based on atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), which allows a good control of kinetics and polydispersity: the reaction takes place in a polar solvent, and the reaction medium remains always crystal clear. For such small particles, in contrary to direct space imaging, SANS is appropriate for characterization of the polymer corona as well as of the silica core using contrast matching provided by mixing normal and deuterated solvent. This allows checking of the level of aggregation at the nanoscale, which is found to be limited to a few percent of the particles in the reaction batch. After an initial slight increase, it is reduced by further polymerization, while the polymer layer grows progressively. After purification, grafted silica can be characterized accurately: its scattering can be fitted by a model of a silica core containing three to five particles surrounded by a polymer shell of thickness 7 nm. This is in good agreement with chain length and grafting density (214 sites per particle) evaluated by chemical analysis; hence SANS provides quantitative insight on chemical synthesis.","Carrot, G; Harrak, A El; Oberdisse, J; Jestin, J; Boué, F",Soft matter,148,1

Therefore, this study aims to calculate the cost and extra length of stay (LOS) of neonatal BSI. A prospective case-control study was undertaken at the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of Korle Bu Teaching Hospital (KBTH) in Ghana. METHODS The clinical data of 357 neonates were prospectively analysed. Overall, 100 neonates with BSI and 100 control neonates without BSI were matched by weight, sex and type of delivery. The direct and indirect costs to neonates and their caregivers was obtained on a daily basis. The cost of drugs was confirmed with the Pharmacy Department at KBTH. A count data model, specifically negative binomial regression, was employed to estimate the extra LOS in the NICU due to neonatal BSI. The study analyzed the total, average and marginal costs of neonatal BSI for the case and control groups from the perspective of the patients/carers/providers. RESULTS Fifty-four percent of the total sample were born with a low birth weight. Neonates with BSI recorded higher costs compared with neonates without BSI. The highest difference in direct costs was recorded among neonates with extremely low birth weight (US$732), which is 67% higher than similar neonates without BSI. The regression estimates show a significant correlation between neonatal BSI and LOS in the NICU (p < 0.001). Neonates with BSI stayed an additional 10 days in the NICU compared with their matched cohort. The LOS varies significantly depending on the neonate's weight at birth. The extra days range from 1 day for neonates defined as macrosomia to 15 extra days for extremely low birth weight neonates. CONCLUSIONS Neonatal BSI was significantly associated with prolonged LOS. The continuous presence of experienced medical staff, as well as parents, to monitor newborns during their stay on the ward has enormous economic burden on both hospitals and caregivers.","Fenny, Ama Pokuaa; Otieku, Evans; Labi, Kwaku Appiah-Korang; Asante, Felix Ankomah; Enemark, Ulrika",PharmacoEconomics - open,148,20

Shear wave elastography (SWE) is potentially a method of choice for detecting peripheral nerve involvement. PURPOSE To compare the degree of thickening and nerve elasticity of brachial plexus (BP) nerve roots and evaluate the usefulness of sonoelastography in patients with clinically diagnosed MS without brachial plexopathy. MATERIAL AND METHODS Thirty-two patients with MS and 32 controls were included in the study. Bilateral C5, C6, and C7 mean nerve root diameters, and mean elasticity values in kiloPascal (kPa) were measured in the patient and control groups. The relationship between the age, height, and weight values and nerve diameter-elasticity values of the patient and control groups was compared. RESULTS The elasticity values of the C5 and C6 nerve roots were increased, and the nerve root thickness was decreased in the MS group compared to that in the control (P < 0.05). There was no difference between the C7 mean nerve root elasticity (kPa) and diameter measurements in the patient and control groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION Our study showed an increase in the BP nerve root elasticity values (kPa) in patients with MS compared to that of the control group and a decrease in diameter values thought to be related to the possible chronic atrophic process.

The major components of the GBM include laminins, type IV collagen, nidogens and heparan sulfate proteoglycans. In addition, the GBM harbours a number of other structural and regulatory components and provides a reservoir for growth factors. New technologies have improved our ability to study the composition and assembly of basement membranes. We now know that the GBM is a complex macromolecular structure that undergoes key transitions during glomerular development. Defects in GBM components are associated with a range of hereditary human diseases such as Alport syndrome, which is caused by defects in the genes COL4A3, COL4A4 and COL4A5, and Pierson syndrome, which is caused by variants in LAMB2. In addition, the GBM is affected by acquired autoimmune disorders and metabolic diseases such as diabetes mellitus. Current treatments for diseases associated with GBM involvement aim to reduce intraglomerular pressure and to treat the underlying cause where possible. As our understanding about the maintenance and turnover of the GBM improves, therapies to replace GBM components or to stimulate GBM repair could translate into new therapies for patients with GBM-associated disease.","Naylor, Richard W; Morais, Mychel R P T; Lennon, Rachel",Nature reviews.

However, patient preferences for the topical drugs differ, since a wide variety of topical drugs and topical drug formulations are available. Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate psoriasis patient preferences for topical drugs. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed for English-language articles in Embase, Medline, PsycINFO, Cinahl, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library. Results: Four surveys, six randomized controlled trials, and two prospective studies of mainly good quality were included. Seven of the studies investigated patient preferences for topical drug formulations, while five studies investigated their preferences for different topical drugs. Overall, patients preferred drugs that are easy to apply, less messy, and have a pleasant scent. Conclusion: Psoriasis patient preferences for topical drugs differ. There is no one topical drug or topical drug formulation that suits everyone, which shows the importance of individualized prescriptions for topical drugs that are based on shared decision-making between the prescriber and patient.","Svendsen, Mathias Tiedemann; Feldman, Steven R; Tiedemann, Sylvia Naiga; Sørensen, Anne Sofie Stochholm; Rivas, Cecilie Marie Ringgaard; Andersen, Klaus Ejner",The Journal of dermatological treatment,148,17

The reliability of the measurement method employed during comparison of these foot impressions is paramount to prevent incorrect conclusions being made. A number of methods of obtaining measurements from barefoot impressions have been described in the research literature; however there has been no comprehensive review of their reliability. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review was to determine the reliability of measurements used to describe footprint morphology obtained from static and dynamic barefoot impressions. METHODS Four electronic databases were searched from inception to 23 November 2017. Eligible studies were required to report either the test-retest, intra or inter-rater reliability of measurements taken from barefoot impressions for the purposes of identification or classification of foot morphology. Methodological quality was assessed using the COSMIN checklist. RESULTS Eleven studies were identified that reported the reliability of 10 measurements (Reel method, arch index, Chippaux-Smirak index, footprint angle, Staheli index, contact area, Martirosov's K index, toe score and metatarsal ridge-to-toe measurement). High intra-rater reliability has been established for the Reel method (ICC=0.98-0.99), arch index (ICC=0.96-0.99), Chippaux-Smirak index (ICC=0.98-0.99), footprint angle (ICC=0.97-0.98), Staheli index (ICC=0.98-0.99) and footprint index (ICC=0.96-0.97). High inter-rater reliability has been established for the Reel method (ICC=0.99) and footprint angle (ICC=0.99). Overall methodological quality was rated as 'Poor' to 'Fair'. CONCLUSION The measurement developed by Reel et al. has both its intra- and inter-rater reliability established to be high. However, the findings of this review were unable to inform a recommendation of one specific technique based on reliability data due to a small body of research at this time. Furthermore, there is a lack of data on the reliability of footprint measurement and comparison techniques in real-world scenarios. Overall, the findings regarding reliability of the techniques covered in this systematic review are to be interpreted with caution due to the methodological quality of reliability testing conducted within the included studies.","Hu, Arnold; Arnold, John B; Causby, Ryan; Jones, Sara",Forensic science international,148,1

To minimize SARS-CoV-2 spread, understanding the mechanisms of infection from all possible viral entry routes is essential. As aerosol transmission is thought to be the primary route of spread, we sought to investigate whether the eyes are potential entry portals for SARS-CoV-2. While virus has been detected in the eye, in order for this mucosal membrane to be a bone fide entry source SARS-CoV-2 would need the capacity to productively infect ocular surface cells. As such, we conducted RNA sequencing in ocular cells isolated from adult human cadaver donor eyes as well as from a pluripotent stem cell-derived whole eye organoid model to evaluate the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, essential proteins that mediate SARS-CoV-2 viral entry. We also infected eye organoids and adult human ocular cells with SARS-CoV-2 and evaluated virus replication and the host response to infection. We found the limbus was most susceptible to infection, whereas the central cornea exhibited only low levels of replication. Transcriptional profiling of the limbus upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, found that while type I or III interferons were not detected in the lung epithelium, a significant inflammatory response was mounted. Together these data suggest that the human eye can be directly infected by SARS-CoV-2 and thus is a route warranting protection.

The highest reported compositions consist of mixtures of A-site cations methylammonium (MA), formamidinium (FA) and cesium, and X-site iodide and bromide ions, and are produced by solution processing. However, it is unclear whether solution processing will yield sufficient spatial performance uniformity for large-scale photovoltaic modules or compatibility with deposition of multilayered tandem solar cell stacks. In addition, the volatile MA cation presents long-term stability issues. Here, we report the multisource vacuum deposition of FA0.7Cs0.3Pb(I0.9Br0.1)3 perovskite thin films with high-quality morphological, structural, and optoelectronic properties. We find that the controlled addition of excess PbI2 during the deposition is critical for achieving high performance and stability of the absorber material, and we fabricate p-i-n solar cells with stabilized power output of 18.2%. We also reveal the sensitivity of the deposition process to a range of parameters, including substrate, annealing temperature, evaporation rates, and source purity, providing a guide for further evaporation efforts. Our results demonstrate the enormous promise for MA-free perovskite solar cells employing industry-scalable multisource evaporation processes.","Chiang, Yu-Hsien; Anaya, Miguel; Stranks, Samuel D",ACS energy letters,148,1

MATERIAL AND METHODS During 53 days of the COVID‑19 related state of emergency with a lockdown (March 15-May 6, 2020) in the Republic of Serbia, as well as in the corresponding periods of 2018 and 2019, data on the daily sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ground-level ozone (O3) and particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) concentrations were analyzed. The total mortality data were analyzed to estimate the impact of the COVID‑19 related lockdown measures on the burden of health in a given population, attributed to the outdoor air quality in the City of Novi Sad, using AirQ+ software. RESULTS The average daily concentrations of PM2.5, NO2, PM10 and SO2 were reduced by 35%, 34%, 23% and 18%, respectively. In contrast, the average daily concentration of O3 increased by 8%, even if the primary precursors were reducing, thus representing a challenge for air quality management. In the City of Novi Sad, a reduction in the average daily PM2.5 concentration of 11.23 μg/m³ was significant, which resulted in a quantified number of avoided deaths. CONCLUSIONS Air pollution in the City of Novi Sad had a chance to be improved due to some preventive measures related to the infectious disease (the COVID‑19 related lockdown), which in turn was the mitigation measure to air pollution with positive public health effects. The confirmed positive effects of the improved air quality on public health could also include raising collective resistance to mass non-communicable and infectious diseases such as COVID‑19 and reducing economic costs.","Dragic, Natasa; Bijelovic, Sanja; Jevtic, Marija; Velicki, Radmila; Radic, Ivana",International journal of occupational medicine and environmental health,148,16

Currently available tools to predict post-operative risk are suboptimally calibrated and do not account for surgery type. Our objective was to use population-level data to derive and internally validate novel cirrhosis surgical risk models. METHODS We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the Veterans Outcomes and Costs Associated with Liver Disease (VOCAL) cohort, which contains granular data on patients with cirrhosis from 128 United States medical centers, merged with the Veterans Affairs Surgical Quality Improvement Program (VASQIP) to identify surgical procedures. We categorized surgeries as abdominal wall, vascular, abdominal, cardiac, chest, or orthopedic, and used multivariable logistic regression to model 30, 90, and 180-day post-operative mortality (VOCAL-Penn models). We compared model discrimination and calibration of VOCAL-Penn to the Mayo risk score (MRS), MELD, MELD-Na, and Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) scores. RESULTS We identified 4,712 surgical procedures in 3,785 patients with cirrhosis. The novel VOCAL-Penn models were derived and internally validated with excellent discrimination (30-day post-operative mortality C-statistic=0.859, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.809-0.909). Predictors included age, pre-operative albumin, platelet count, bilirubin, surgery category, emergency indication, fatty liver disease, American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, and obesity. Model performance was superior to MELD, MELD-Na, CTP, and MRS at all timepoints (e.g. 30-day post-operative mortality C-statistic for MRS=0.766, 95% CI 0.676-0.855) in terms of discrimination and calibration. CONCLUSION The VOCAL-Penn models substantially improve post-operative mortality predictions in patients with cirrhosis. These models may be applied in practice to improve pre-operative risk stratification and optimize patient selection for surgical procedures (www.vocalpennscore.com).","Mahmud, Nadim; Fricker, Zachary; Hubbard, Rebecca A; Ioannou, George N; Lewis, James D; Taddei, Tamar H; Rothstein, Kenneth D; Serper, Marina; Goldberg, David S; Kaplan, David E",Hepatology,148,1

The current study established a burn model in rats and used a free radical scavenger edaravone (ED) to treat the rats, so as to investigate the effect of edaravone on intestinal mucosa barrier after burn injury. METHODS Anesthetized rats were subjected to 40% total body surface area water burn immediately, followed by treatment with ED, scrambled antagomir, or antagomiR-320. Intestinal mucosa damage was observed by hematoxylin-eosin staining and graded by colon mucosal damage index (CMDI) score. The contents of total sulfhydryl (TSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were determined by spectrophotometry. Cell apoptosis, protein relative expression,and the in situ expressions of p-Akt and p-Bad were detected by flow cytometry, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry, respectively. The miR-320 expression was determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS ED alleviated intestinal mucosal damage caused by burn injury, down-regulated the levels of MDA, cytochrome C, cleaved caspase-9 and cleaved caspase-3, but up-regulated the levels of TSH, SOD, CAT and Bcl-2. We also found that ED could reduce oxidative stress, inhibit cell apoptosis, increase the expressions of p-Akt, p-Bad and miR-320, and decrease PTEN expression. PTEN was predicted to be the target gene for miR-320, and cell apoptosis could be promoted by inhibiting miR-320 expression. CONCLUSION ED regulates Akt/Bad/Caspase signaling cascade to reduce apoptosis and oxidative stress through up-regulating miR-320 expression and down-regulating PTEN expression, thus protecting the intestinal mucosal barrier of rats from burn injury.","Ke, Jiaxiang; Bian, Xi; Liu, Hu; Li, Bei; Huo, Ran",Molecular medicine,148,5

Although simulation and skills laboratories are emerging as promising alternatives for skills training, their integration into graduate surgical education is inconsistent, erratic, and often on a voluntary basis. We hypothesize that, by implementing the American College of Surgeons/Association of Program Directors in Surgery Surgical Skills Curriculum in a structured, inanimate setting, we can address some of these concerns. METHODS Sixty junior surgery residents were assigned to the Penn Surgical Simulation and Skills Rotation. The National Surgical Skills Curriculum was implemented using multiple educational tools under faculty supervision. Pretraining and posttraining assessments of technical skills were conducted using validated instruments. Trainee and faculty feedbacks were collected using a structured feedback form. RESULTS Significant global performance improvement was demonstrated using Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills score for basic surgical skills (knot tying, wound closure, enterotomy closure, and vascular anastomosis) and Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery skills, P < 0.001. Six trainees were retested on an average of 13.5 months later (range, 8-16 months) and retained more than 75% of their basic surgical skills.

INTRODUCTION Hypersensitivity to metal was first reported in 1966. Since this time, the use of metal in prosthetic devices has increased with an associated rise in reported hypersensitivity reaction to other metals. Symptoms of metal hypersensitivity can be subtle, and it is unclear whether clinicians are aware of or routinely ask about metal hypersensitivity when documenting allergies. This can lead to a delay in diagnosis, which puts patients at risk of poor outcomes. Hence there is a need to map the available evidence on hypersensitivity reaction in people who receive metallic device implantation. INCLUSION CRITERIA The review will consider studies published in the English language and that include patients who undergo procedures involving metal implantations.

METHODS The sample included 100 youth between the ages of 13 to 17 years admitted to an inpatient psychiatric unit in Ontario, Canada between September and November 2019 (78% response rate). Youth data were comprised of electronic self-reported assessments (during hospitalization and 6-months following) and chart reviews (99% consented; historical and prospective). Frontline staff completed a self-report survey assessing their perceptions of the need for standardized substance use assessments, training, and interventions on the unit (n = 38 Registered Nurses and Child and Youth Workers; 86% response rate). Analyses included descriptive statistics, correlations, regression, and qualitative content analysis. RESULTS Feasibility of standardized youth self-reported mental health and substance use assessments was evident by high response rates, little missing data, and variability in responses. 79% of youth had used at least one substance in their lifetime; 69% reported use in the last 3 months. Substance use was positively correlated with severity of psychiatric symptoms (τb 0.17 to 0.45) and number of psychiatric diagnoses (τb 0.17 to 0.54) at index. Based on prospective and retrospective data, substance use was also positively related to mental health symptom severity at follow-up and repeat mental health related hospital visits. Frontline staff reported a need for standardized assessment, training, and interventions on the unit, indicative of acceptability. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrated the feasibility, acceptability and clinical importance of administering a standardized mental health and substance use assessment among youth experiencing psychiatric hospitalization.","Halladay, Jillian; Horricks, Laurie; Amlung, Michael; MacKillop, James; Munn, Catharine; Nasir, Zil; Woock, Rachel; Georgiades, Katholiki",Child and adolescent psychiatry and mental health,148,23

However, a subset of aneurysms will fail to occlude following treatment and the factors that influence the efficacy of flow diversion remain uncertain. As smaller diameter PEDs inherently have greater metal density than larger devices, we elected to investigate whether PED diameter influences treatment efficacy when using a single device. We also evaluated other factors that may influence treatment outcomes with PED. METHODS We retrospectively evaluated all patients treated for an intracranial saccular aneurysm at our institution with a single PED at least 12 months prior to the time of data collection. Patients treated with multiple devices, adjunctive coiling, traumatic and fusiform target aneurysms, as well as patients with inadequate imaging follow-up (<12 months) were excluded. RESULTS 158 aneurysms in 124 patients (128 treatments) met the inclusion criteria for our study. 123 aneurysms (80%) were occluded over an average follow-up of 26.6 months. Multivariable logistic regression showed that branch vessel incorporation into the target aneurysm sac (p<0.001, OR=0.15) was significantly associated with aneurysm persistence, while smaller PED diameter was significantly associated with aneurysm occlusion (p=0.008; OR=0.30). CONCLUSIONS PED diameter significantly impacts outcomes when using a single device for the treatment of small anterior circulation intracranial saccular aneurysms, most likely due to the inherent greater metal density of smaller devices. This factor should be taken into account when planning endovascular aneurysm treatment with PED.","Kole, Matthew James; Miller, Timothy Ryan; Cannarsa, Gregory; Wessell, Aaron; Jones, Salazar; Le, Elizabeth; Jindal, Gaurav; Aldrich, François; Simard, J Marc; Gandhi, Dheeraj",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,148,1

Preliminary evidence has shown that the COVID-19 pandemic had a detrimental impact on undergraduate student mental health and well-being, however existing data are predominantly limited to cross-sectional survey-based studies. Due to the evolving nature of the pandemic, longer-term prospective surveillance efforts are needed to better anticipate risk and protective factors during a pandemic. OBJECTIVE The overarching aim of this research is to use a mobile (primarily smartphone-based) surveillance system to identify risk and protective factors for undergraduate mental health. Factors will be identified from weekly self-report data (e.g., affect, living accommodation) and device sensor data (e.g., physical activity, device usage) to prospectively predict self-reported mental health and service utilization. METHODS Undergraduate students at Western University, Canada, will be recruited via e-mail to complete an internet baseline questionnaire with the option to participate in the study on a weekly basis using the Student Pandemic Experience (SPE) mobile application (app) for Android/iOS. The app collects sensor samples (e.g., GPS coordinates, steps) and self-reported weekly mental health and wellness surveys. Student participants can opt-in to link their mobile data with campus-based administrative data capturing health service utilization. Risk and protective factors that predict mental health outcomes are expected to be estimated by 1) cross-sectional associations between student characteristics (e.g., demographics) and key psychosocial factors (e.g., affect, stress, social connection) and behaviors (e.g., physical activity, device usage) and 2) longitudinal associations between psychosocial and behavioral factors and campus-based health service utilization. RESULTS Data collection began November 9th, 2020 and will be ongoing through to at least October 31st, 2021. Retention from the baseline survey (N=427) to app sign-up was 315/427 (74%), with approximately 175-215 (55-68%) of app participants actively responding to weekly surveys. From November 9th, 2020 to August 8th, 2021, 4851 responses to the app surveys and 25985 sensor samples (consisting of up to 68 individual data items each, e.g., GPS coordinates, steps) were collected from the 315 participants that signed up for the app. CONCLUSIONS The results of this real-world longitudinal cohort study of undergraduate mental health based on questionnaires and mobile sensor metrics is expected to show psychosocial and behavioral patterns associated with both positive and negative mental health-related states during pandemic conditions at a relatively large, public, residential Canadian university campus.

Effectiveness and safety of bariatric surgery in this group is not established. MATERIALS AND METHODS Retrospective, longitudinal review of clinical data of patients with type 1 diabetes, followed up at our Centre after bariatric surgery was performed elsewhere. RESULTS Sixty-one patients were included, 51% female, 57 (93%) Emirati Arab, 3 (5%) other Arab, 1 (2%) Caucasian, mean age at surgery 31 years. 42 (69%) underwent sleeve gastrectomy, 17 (28%) gastric bypass, 2 (3%) gastric band. In 48 patients with complete follow-up data, improvements were observed at 12 months in median (IQR) BMI (38.5 (34.9-40.9) to 26.1 (24.2-29.6) kg/m2 , p < 0.001), HbA1c (8.6 (7.8-9.2)% to 7.8 (7.2-8.5)%, p < 0.001), daily insulin dose (1.0 (0.7-1.2) to 0.8 (0.6-0.9) unit/kg/day, p < 0.001), systolic BP (127 (116-136) to 116 (110-120) mmHg, p < 0.001) and TC:HDL ratio (3.4 (2.9-4.3) to 3.0 (2.6-3.5), p < 0.001), and albuminuria. In 32 patients followed up at 3 years, median reduction in BMI was 10.4 (5.9-11.7) kg/m2 , 50% reduced or stopped antihypertensive and 58% reduced or stopped lipid-modifying medications. Three individuals each reported a single episode of diabetic ketoacidosis; in one case this was due to cessation of insulin treatment. CONCLUSIONS In these patients with obesity and type 1 diabetes, bariatric surgery led to significant improvements in weight and cardiometabolic parameters, with modest improvements in glycemia.

This study examined the efficacy and safety of primary duct closure following laparoscopic common bile duct exploration (LCBDE) via choledochotomy. METHODS Between September 2011 and September 2013, 157 consecutive patients underwent LCBDE via choledochotomy. RESULTS Of 157 LCBDE procedures, 138 (87.9%) were successfully completed with primary closure of the choledochotomy. Eight patients (5.1%) underwent closure with T-tube drainage after choledochotomy and 11 patients (7.0%) were converted to open surgery. The biliary tree was free of stones at the end of surgery in 154 patients (98.1%). Postoperative bile leak occurred in 6 patients (3.8%). The median follow-up period was 18 (2-33) months, with no evidence of further bile duct stones or bile duct stricture in any patients. Univariable analysis revealed that successful duct clearance (p = 0.010) and diameter of the common bile duct (p < 0.001) were two significant risk factors for bile leak. CONCLUSIONS Primary duct closure following LCBDE is effective and safe for the management of choledocholithiasis. The postoperative bile leak rate may be low in skilled laparoscopic surgeons with a careful selection of patients.","Hua, Jie; Lin, Shengping; Qian, Daohai; He, Zhigang; Zhang, Ti; Song, Zhenshun",Digestive surgery,148,23

The HIV prevention cascades have been proposed to replicate the success of the treatment cascades and reinvigorate the prevention programmes through improved monitoring, planning and delivery. We adapted the cascade framework to the PWID context in Ukraine, assessed gaps and analysed factors associated with achieving ""access"" and ""effective use"" outcomes. METHODS Self-reported data on the use of prevention services and risk behaviours from the 2017 integrated bio-behavioural survey among PWID in Ukraine were used to construct cascades for needle/syringe and condom programmes (NSP and CP). Socio-demographic and behavioural variables were evaluated as potential correlates of cascade outcomes. RESULTS The NSP cascade analysis included 7815 HIV-negative PWID. Motivation to use clean syringes was not assessed and assumed at 100%. Access to clean syringes through NSP in the past 12 months was reported by 2789 participants (35.7%). Effective use of syringes (no sharing in the past 30 days) was reported by 7405 participants (94.8%). NSP access was higher among women, individuals older than 44, and mixed drug users; while effective use was reported more frequently by men and opioid users, with no difference by age. The CP cascade analysis included 6606 (85%) of the HIV-negative PWID who had sex in the past three months. Of those, 2282 (34.5%) received condoms, and 1708 (25.9%) reported consistent use with all partners in the past three months. Older PWID and mixed-drug users accessed condoms more frequently; whereas younger subgroups and opioid users used them more consistently. CONCLUSIONS Overall, the cascade framework was useful to describe the status of HIV prevention among PWID in Ukraine and to identify areas for improvement in the programming and evaluation of HIV prevention. Access to needle/syringe and condom programmes was substantially below the recommended levels. Effective use of clean syringes was reported by a vast majority of PWID, although likely affected by self-report bias; whereas consistent condom use was infrequent. Socio-demographic and behavioural variables showed significant associations in NSP and CP cascade analyses, with little consistency between the access and effective use outcomes.","Dumchev, Kostyantyn; Sazonova, Yana; Smyrnov, Pavlo; Cheshun, Olga; Pashchuk, Oksana; Saliuk, Tetiana; Varetska, Olga",Journal of the International AIDS Society,148,1

Previous assessments of the transcriptome of in vitro potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) exposed to US transmitted through air (AB-US) or liquid (PE-US) revealed the up- or down-regulation of several stress-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to abiotic stress. In a bid to better characterize stress-related elements over a four-week period, the transcriptome of AB-US was compared to that of PE-US. When comparing the controls of both treatments, DEGs related to hypoxia were not detected. Nevertheless, hypoxia-related DEGs were detected in the combination of liquid medium and ultrasonication. DEGs coding for chitinase, peroxidase, glutathione-S-transferase, transcription factors of ERF (ethylene responsive factor), DREB (dehydration-responsive element-binding), WRKY and MYB were also significantly highly expressed in PE-US, relative to AB-US. Up- and down-regulation of DEGs related to metabolic processes, and enzymes of the antioxidant system also confirm that PE-US is a more acute abiotic stress than AB-US. KEY MESSAGE: A transcriptomic analysis revealed that liquid-based ultrasonication was a stronger abiotic stressor than air-based ultrasonication. Of particular interest were the heat shock proteins and transcription factors in this comparison. Despite the ultrasound stress, explants survived and plantlets developed.","Dobránszki, Judit; Hidvégi, Norbert; Gulyás, Andrea; Tóth, Bianka; Teixeira da Silva, Jaime A",Progress in biophysics and molecular biology,148,1

SOD1-positive aggregates in motor neurons, as well as proteins that interact with the aggregates are presumably involved in ALS neurotoxicity. We used a proteomics approach to compare differences in protein expression in spinal cord homogenates from non-transgenic (NTG) and ALS model mice. Using the homogenates, we identified proteins that interacted with SOD1 seeds in vitro. We assessed differences in SOD1-interacting proteins in cell cultures treated with proteasome or autophagy inhibitor. In the first experiment, intermediate filamentous and small heat shock proteins were upregulated in glial cells. We identified 26 protein types that interacted with aggregation cores in ALS model homogenates, and unexpectedly, 40 proteins in were detected in NTG mice. In cell cultures treated with proteasome and autophagy inhibitors, we identified 16 and 11 SOD1-interacting proteins, respectively, and seven proteins in untreated cells. These SOD1-interacting proteins were involved in multiple cellular functions such as protein quality control, cytoskeletal organization, and pathways involved in growth factor signaling and their downstream cascades. The complex interactions between pathways could cause further dysregulation, ultimately leading to fatal cellular dysfunction in ALS.","Une, Mio; Yamakawa, Miho; Watanabe, Yasuhiro; Uchino, Kazuyuki; Honda, Naoto; Adachi, Mayuka; Nakanishi, Mami; Umezawa, Akihiro; Kawata, Yasushi; Nakashima, Kenji; Hanajima, Ritsuko",Neuroscience research,148,1

As improperly disposed masks enter the ocean, the risk to the marine ecological system is further aggravated, especially in the shoreline environment. The objective of this study is to explore the changing characteristics and environmental behaviors of disposable masks when exposed to the shoreline environment. The transformation of chain structure and chemical composition of masks as well as the decreased mechanical strength of masks after UV weathering were observed. The melt-blown cloth in the middle layer of masks was found to be particularly sensitive to UV irradiation. A single weathered mask can release more than 1.5 million microplastics to the aqueous environment. The physical abrasion caused by sand further exacerbated the release of microplastic particles from masks, with more than 16 million particles released from just one weathered mask in the presence of sand. The study results indicate that shorelines are not only the main receptor of discarded masks from oceans and lands, but also play host to further transformation of masks to plastic particles.","Wang, Zheng; An, Chunjiang; Chen, Xiujuan; Lee, Kenneth; Zhang, Baiyu; Feng, Qi",Journal of hazardous materials,148,16

First, we report our use of restriction site-associated DNA (RAD) polymorphism markers for rapidly mapping mutations after chemical mutagenesis and mutant isolation. Second, we describe our use of genomic interval pull-down sequencing (GIPS) to selectively capture and sequence megabase-sized portions of a mutant genome.

METHODS A total of 24 rats were equally divided into three groups. In the first group, no treatment was applied after laminectomy (control group, Group 1). In the second group, hemostasis was achieved after laminectomy, and 2 mm absorbable gelatin sponge soaked in saline was placed over the epidural space and the wound was closed (Group 2). In the third group, hemostasis was achieved following laminectomy, and 0.5 mL RPGH (Coseal®, Group 3) was squeezed over the dura mater, and the wound was closed. A histopathological examination was undertaken to evaluate arachnoidal invasion and EF. RESULTS The results of EF in the Group 2 and Group 3 were significantly lower compared to the Group 1 (p = 0.023 and p = 0.002, respectively). No statistically significant difference was found between the Group 2 and Group 3 in terms of EF (p = 0.957). There was also no statistically significant difference between the mean arachnoidal invasion of the three groups (p > 0.171). However, the rate of arachnoidal invasion was the lowest in the Group 3.

The validity of continuous deterministic models is questionable because they fail to incorporate two important characteristics of human society: high clustering and low degree of separation. A small-world network model is used to study the spread of COVID-19, thus providing more reliable information to provide guidance to mitigate it. Optimal timing of lockdown and reopening society is investigated so that intervention measures to combat COVID-19 can work more efficiently. Several important findings are listed as follows: travel restrictions should be implemented as soon as possible; if 'flattening the curve' is the purpose of the interventions, measures to reduce community transmission need not be very strict so that the lockdown can be sustainable; the fraction of the population that is susceptible, rather than the levels of daily new cases and deaths, is a better criterion to decide when to reopen society; and society can be safely reopened when the susceptible population is still as high as 70%, given that the basic reproduction number is 2.5. Results from small-world network models can be significantly different than those from continuous deterministic models, and the differences are mainly due to a major shortfall intrinsically embedded in the continuous deterministic models. As such, small-world network models provide meaningful improvements over continuous deterministic models and therefore should be used in the mathematical modeling of infection spread to guide the present COVID-19 interventions. For future epidemics, the present framework of mathematical modeling can be a better alternative to continuous deterministic models.","Du, Marvin",Scientific reports,148,17

Independent external clinical validation of performance characteristics is of paramount importance. Methods Four fully automated assays, Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2, Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG, Siemens SARS-CoV-2 total (COV2T) and SARS-CoV-2 IgG (COV2G) were evaluated using 350 pre-pandemic samples and 700 samples from 245 COVID-19 patients (158 hospitalized, 87 outpatients). Results All tests showed very high diagnostic specificity. Sensitivities in samples collected at least 14 days after disease onset were slightly lower than manufacturers' claims for Roche (93.0%), Abbott (90.8%), and Siemens COV2T (90.3%), and distinctly lower for Siemens COV2G (78.8%). Concordantly negative results were enriched for immunocompromised patients. ROC curve analyses suggest a lowering of the cut-off index for the Siemens COV2G assay. Finally, the combination of two anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays is feasible when considering borderline reactive results. Conclusions Thorough on-site evaluation of commercially available serologic tests for detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 remains imperative for laboratories.

High throughput genotyping of BC samples has led to the identification and characterization of biomarkers for the diagnosis of BC. The most common genetic variants studied are SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) that determine susceptibility to an array of diseases thus serving as a potential tool for identifying the underlying causes of breast carcinogenesis. METHODS SNP genotyping employing the Agena MassARRAY offers a robust, sensitive, cost-effective method to assess multiple SNPs and samples simultaneously. In this present study, we analyzed 15 SNPs of 14 genes in 550 samples (150 cases and 400 controls).

Although they work with diverse populations, there is a lack of literature on culturally competent education during an emergency such as a pandemic. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES To examine the effectiveness of an online education programme aimed at increasing cultural competence among rescue teams and healthcare professionals facing the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN Pre-post-web-based intervention study. METHODS Pre-post-intervention surveys were administered to a matched sample of Israeli healthcare and rescue organisation professionals. The initial sample included 303 participants (52% women) who completed the pre-intervention survey. More than half of the sample (56%, n = 170) were paid workers or volunteers in health organisations. Of the initial sample, 154 participants completed the post-intervention survey following the online cultural competence education programme. Descriptive statistics and multivariate analysis were used to evaluate participants' gains in culturally competent attitudes, knowledge, skills and encounters. This study followed the STROBE guidelines. RESULTS Participants found the online programme useful in improving their cultural competence during the COVID-19 pandemic. The highest gains were found in the attitudes domains, whereas the lowest in the knowledge domain. Pre-intervention cultural competence scores and incorporating the programme in the educational curricula predicted increased gains in cultural competence. CONCLUSIONS Online educational interventions showed potential for increasing professionals' awareness of cultural biases, differences and attitudes, leading to more open and accepting attitudes towards patients of different backgrounds.

We report on single-access transumbilical laparoscopic appendectomy (SATLA) and cholecystectomy (SATLC), performed using new curved reusable instruments. PATIENTS AND METHODS A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database of 30 patients who underwent SATLA and 20 patients who underwent SATLC between May and November 2009 was undertaken. All procedures were performed with an 11-mm nondisposable trocar for the scope, and curved reusable instruments (Karl Storz-Endoskope, Tuttlingen, Germany) placed transumbilically without trocars. Outcome measures were conversion to standard laparoscopy, operative time, scar length, complications, hospital stay, and use of pain medication. RESULTS All SATLA patients had acute appendicitis, and SATLC patients had symptomatic gallstones (15), chronic cholecystitis (3), and acute cholecystitis (2). No extraumbilical trocars were necessary. Mean total operative times were 57.3 ± 15.9 min (SATLA) and 73.9 ± 20.1 min (SATLC). Mean laparoscopic times were 39 ± 13.1 min (SATLA) and 57.5 ± 18.9 min (SATLC). Mean scar lengths were 14.8 ± 2.2 mm (SATLA) and 15.8 ± 2.3 mm (SATLC). Five SATLA patients and one SATLC patient developed postoperative complications. Mean hospital stay was 2.9 ± 1.3 days for SATLA patients and 1.8 ± 0.8 days for SATLC patients. Pain medication used was minimal. At the minimum follow-up of 3 months no late complications were registered. CONCLUSIONS SATLA and SATLC can be performed safely using curved reusable instruments, which helps avoid the conflict between the surgeon's hands or between the instruments' tips and allows the surgeon to operate in an ergonomic position. The reusable instruments kept the cost similar to that of classic laparoscopy.","Dapri, Giovanni; Casali, Lorenzo; Dumont, Hélène; Van der Goot, Laurens; Herrandou, Leila; Pastijn, Els; Sosnowski, Maurice; Himpens, Jacques; Cadière, Guy-Bernard",Surgical endoscopy,148,31

Currently, the reliability of CTP is hampered by varying results between different post-processing software packages. The purpose of this study is to compare ischemic core volumes estimated by IntelliSpace Portal (ISP) and syngo.via with core volumes as estimated by RAPID. METHODS Thirty-five CTP datasets from patients in the MR CLEAN trial were post-processed. Core volumes were estimated with ISP using default settings and with syngo.via using three different settings: default settings (method A); additional smoothing filter (method B); and adjusted settings (method C). The results were compared with RAPID. Agreement between methods was assessed using Bland-Altman analysis and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Accuracy for detecting volumes up to 25 mL, 50 mL, and 70 mL was assessed. Final infarct volumes were determined on follow-up non-contrast CT. RESULTS Median core volume was 50 mL with ISP, 41 mL with syngo.via method A, 20 mL with method B, 36 mL with method C, and 11 mL with RAPID. Agreement ranged from poor (ISP: ICC 0.41; method A: ICC 0.23) to good (method B: ICC 0.83; method C: ICC 0.85). The bias (1.8 mL) and limits of agreement (-27, 31 mL) were the smallest with syngo.via with additional smoothing (method B).

There are currently no approved vaccines for SARS-CoV-2, which causes severe respiratory illness or death. Defining the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 will be essential for understanding disease progression, long-term immunity, and vaccine efficacy. Here we describe two methods for evaluating the neutralization capacity of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The basic protocol is a focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT), which involves immunostaining infected cells with a chromogen deposit readout. The alternate protocol is a modification of the FRNT that uses an infectious clone-derived SARS-CoV-2 virus expressing a fluorescent reporter. These protocols are adapted for use in a high-throughput setting, and are compatible with large-scale vaccine studies or clinical testing. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC Basic Protocol: Focus reduction neutralization test Alternate Protocol: mNeonGreen-based focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT-mNG).","Vanderheiden, Abigail; Edara, Venkata Viswanadh; Floyd, Katharine; Kauffman, Robert C; Mantus, Grace; Anderson, Evan; Rouphael, Nadine; Edupuganti, Sri; Shi, Pei-Yong; Menachery, Vineet D; Wrammert, Jens; Suthar, Mehul S",Current protocols in immunology,148,2

And meanwhile highlighted the important meanings for every stomatologists. Firstly, from the history of dentistry or stomatology, the establishment of occlusion and gnathology drived the transformation of dentistry from a craft practice into an independent profession and discipline. Secondly, from the evolution of occlusion, jaw, and TMJ, this article clarified the distinctiveness and uniqueness of occlusion, jaw and TMJ that made modern human beings the most highly endowed. Thirdly, teeth and other oral organs not only have masticatory and digestive functions but also possess more complex social functions. Stomatognathic system is a more accurate conception than oral organs which is usually called. The conception of stomatognathic system gives a clearer sense of wholeness and more beneficial for accurate diagnosis and treatment of occlusion-related diseases as well as temporomandibular disorders. Finally, the author introduced five common examples regarding medical care and patient-doctor relationships in order to further emphasize the significance of the study of occlusion, gnathology and TMJ. It is necessary for not only general stomatoloaists but also other dental specialists in stomatology to clearly understand the principal theories and proficiently master the management capability on occlusion, gnathology and temporomandibular disorders.","Zhang, Z K",Zhonghua kou qiang yi xue za zhi = Zhonghua kouqiang yixue zazhi = Chinese journal of stomatology,148,30

STUDY DESIGN Retrospective controlled cohort study. METHODS All tonsillectomies performed by practice physicians during the period January 1, 2010 to August 31, 2019 were identified. Three groups were created based on surgeon technique utilization: the study group (VLET) and two control groups (exclusive standard energy monopolar [Standard]; exclusive ""hot"" technique without exclusive monopolar use [Mixed ""Hot""]). Each group's PTH occurrences requiring surgical intervention (PTHRSI) were identified and rates compared. RESULTS During the study period 11,348 tonsillectomies were performed (4,427 Standard, 1,374 VLET, 5,547 Mixed ""Hot""), and 167 (1.47%) PTHRSI events identified (14 primary (<24 hours), 153 secondary (>24 hours), 12 repeat (>1PTHRSI/patient). Compared to the Standard group secondary and total PTHRSI rates (1.47%, 1.60%), the Mixed ""Hot"" group experienced similar rates (1.57%, P = .54; 1.68%, P = .64), but the VLET group experienced significantly lower rates (0.15%, P = .0026, adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.114 [0.028-0.469]; 0.22%, P = .0016, adjusted OR 0.155 [0.048-0.494]). Age was a significant risk factor for both secondary and total PTHRSI (P = .0025, P = .0024, adjusted OR 1.02/year [1.01-1.03]). No significant difference in rate of primary PTHRSI was seen collectively or in any age group. The <12VLET Group experienced 0 episodes of secondary PTHRSI and a total PTHRSI rate of 0.09% in 1060 tonsillectomies.

World Health Organization (WHO) has already declared it as a pandemic for the whole world, with nearly six million positive cases. Highly contagious nature of the virus has challenged the medical facilities of all the developed and developing country health system. Early identification of the infection is very important to provide medical facilities and cease the chain of infection to new persons. The symptoms such as fever, dry cough, breathing issues generally show in patients not before 5-7 days. However, the patients feel the loss of smell or taste (anosmia) as early as second day onwards due to the presence of virus in nose and throat. Low-cost techniques such as SniffIn-sticks ® Smell Test and UPSIT etc. can be used to test anosmia along with medically approved olfactory test leading to identification of COVID-19 infections. With leading researchers findings anosmia test will be effective in breaking the chain infection of COVID-19 virus. In the exit ports, anosmia test kits may be added to thermal testing to identify the infected patients with low symptoms.

However, low-sodium diet trials in HD are sparse and indicate that dietary education and behavioral counseling are ineffective in reducing sodium intake. This study aimed to determine whether 4 weeks of low-sodium, home-delivered meals in HD patients reduces interdialytic weight gain (IDWG). Secondary outcomes included changes in dietary sodium intake, thirst, xerostomia, blood pressure, volume overload, and muscle sodium concentration. METHODS Twenty HD patients (55 ± 12 years, body mass index [BMI] 40.7 ± 16.6 kg/m2 ) were enrolled in this study. Participants followed a usual (control) diet for the first 4 weeks followed by 4 weeks of three low-sodium, home-delivered meals per day. We measured IDWG, hydration status (bioimpedance), standardized blood pressure (BP), food intake (3-day dietary recall), and muscle sodium (magnetic resonance imaging) at baseline (0 M), after the 4-week period of usual diet (1 M), and after the meal intervention (2 M). FINDINGS The low-sodium meal intervention significantly reduced IDWG when compared to the control period (-0.82 ± 0.14 kg; 95% confidence interval, -0.55 to -1.08 kg; P < 0.001). There were also 1 month (1 M) to 2 month (2 M) reductions in dietary sodium intake (-1687 ± 297 mg; P < 0.001); thirst score (-4.4 ± 1.3; P = 0.003), xerostomia score (-6.7 ± 1.9; P = 0.002), SBP (-18.0 ± 3.6 mmHg; P < 0.001), DBP (-5.9 ± 2.0 mmHg; P = 0.008), and plasma phosphorus -1.55 ± 0.21 mg/dL; P = 0.005), as well as a 0 M to 2 M reduction in absolute volume overload (-1.08 ± 0.33 L; P = 0.025). However, there were no significant changes in serum or tissue sodium (all P > 0.05). DISCUSSION Low-sodium, home-meal delivery appears to be an effective method for improving volume control and blood pressure in HD patients.

First, we describe a framework for applicant-program compatibility based on applicant priorities and program offerings, including clinical training, academic training, practice setting, residency culture, personal life, and professional goals. Second, a conceptual model for applicant screening based on metrics, experiences, attributes, and alignment with program priorities is presented that might facilitate holistic review. We call for design and validation of novel metrics, such as situational judgment tests for professionalism. Together, these steps could improve the transparency, efficiency and fidelity of the residency application process.

The clinical benefits of laparoscopic surgery are well established; however, many patients are still not offered a laparoscopic procedure. Our objective was to compare the modern clinical and financial outcomes of laparoscopic and open colorectal surgery. METHODS The Premier Perspective database identified patients undergoing elective colorectal resections from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2013. Cases were stratified by operative approach into laparoscopic and open cohorts. Groups were controlled on all demographics, diagnosis, procedural, hospital characteristics, surgeon volume, and surgeon specialty and then compared for clinical and financial outcomes. The main outcome measures were length of stay (LOS), complications, readmission rates, and cost by surgical approach. RESULTS A total of 6343 patients were matched and analyzed in each cohort. The most common diagnosis was diverticulitis (p = 0.0835) and the most common procedure a sigmoidectomy (p = 0.0962). The LOS was significantly shorter in laparoscopic compared to open (mean 5.78 vs. 7.80 days, p < 0.0001). The laparoscopic group had significantly lower readmission (5.82 vs. 7.68 %, p < 0.0001), complication (32.60 vs. 42.28 %, p < 0.0001), and mortality rates (0.52 vs. 1.28 %, p < 0.0001). The total cost was significantly lower in laparoscopic than in open (mean $17,269 vs. $20,552, p < 0.0001). By category, laparoscopy was significantly more cost-effective for pharmacy (p < 0.0001), room and board (p < 0.0001), recovery room (p = 0.0058), ICU (p < 0.0001), and laboratory and imaging services (both p < 0.0001). Surgical supplies (p < 0.0001), surgery (p < 0.0001), and anesthesia (p = 0.0053) were higher for the laparoscopic group. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopy is more cost-effective and produces better patient outcomes than open colorectal surgery. Minimally invasive colorectal surgery is now the standard that should be offered to patients, providing value to both patient and provider.","Keller, Deborah S; Delaney, Conor P; Hashemi, Lobat; Haas, Eric M",Surgical endoscopy,148,7

Early clinical experience with HCV NAT+ donor organs has shown promising outcomes; however best practices are lacking to guide transplant programs during all phases of patient care. Transplant programs developing protocols for the utilization of HCV NAT+ organs will need a multidisciplinary team to address all aspects of pre-transplant and post-transplant patient care. Reports of fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis in HCV NAT+ organ transplant recipients receiving delayed DAA initiation highlight the need for the transplant community to develop safe and effective protocols. A failure to do so will inevitably lead to the erosion of public trust from cases of missed or inadequately treated donor-derived HCV infections.

Although medical advances have improved survival rates, men treated for prostate cancer experience side-effects that can reduce their work capacity, increase financial stress, and affect their career and/or retirement plans. Working-age males comprise a significant proportion of new prostate cancer diagnoses. It is important, therefore, to understand the connections between prostate cancer and men's work lives. This scoping review aimed to summarize and disseminate current research evidence about the impact of prostate cancer treatment on men's work lives. Electronic databases were searched to identify peer-reviewed articles published between 2006 and 2020 that reported on the impact of prostate cancer treatment on men's work. Following scoping review guidelines, 21 articles that met inclusion criteria were identified and analyzed. Evidence related to the impact of prostate cancer on work was grouped under three themes: (1) work outcomes after prostate cancer treatment; (2) return to work considerations, and (3) impact of prostate cancer treatment on men's finances. Findings indicate that men's return to work may be more gradual than expected after prostate cancer treatment. Some men may feel pressured by financial stressors and masculine ideals to resume work. Diverse factors including older age and social benefits appear to play a role in shaping men's work-related plans after prostate cancer treatment.

Possible outcomes for these procedures is a postoperative joint infection (PJI) that can cause long postoperative lengths of stay (LOS) in the hospital. The PJIs can also negatively impact the quality of life for the patient. Using the roadmap of the continuous quality improvement theory, the purpose of this quantitative study was to examine the relationship between the independent variables (joint education class participation, body mass index [BMI], A1c, and smoking) and dependent variables (PJI and LOS). To evaluate the relationship with PJI, a logistical regression analyzed the sample population of 1216 patients and indicated a relationship between joint education class attendance and PJI among total hip patients, but not total knee patients when controlling for the other variables. The regression also indicated a significant relationship between BMI and smoking and PJIs, but it did not show a relationship between A1c/diabetes and PJI. To evaluate the relationship between joint class education and LOS a Poisson regression indicated that those who did not attended the joint education class, whether they had total hips or total knees, had a longer postoperative LOS. The implications for positive social change involve providing information to physicians and administrators regarding the effectiveness of the total joint education class in improving outcomes. This information could be used to justify the need for patient compliance with the class and/or the possible need for additional resources to support the total joint education program.","Marshall, Kevin",Journal of orthopaedics,148,31

However, excessive NOX2 activity can exacerbate inflammation, as in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Here, we use two unbiased chemical proteomic strategies to show that small-molecule LDC7559, or a more potent designed analog NA-11, inhibits the NOX2-dependent oxidative burst in neutrophils by activating the glycolytic enzyme phosphofructokinase-1 liver type (PFKL) and dampening flux through the pentose phosphate pathway. Accordingly, neutrophils treated with NA-11 had reduced NOX2-dependent outputs, including neutrophil cell death (NETosis) and tissue damage. A high-resolution structure of PFKL confirmed binding of NA-11 to the AMP/ADP allosteric activation site and explained why NA-11 failed to agonize phosphofructokinase-1 platelet type (PFKP) or muscle type (PFKM). Thus, NA-11 represents a tool for selective activation of PFKL, the main phosphofructokinase-1 isoform expressed in immune cells.","Amara, Neri; Cooper, Madison P; Voronkova, Maria A; Webb, Bradley A; Lynch, Eric M; Kollman, Justin M; Ma, Taylur; Yu, Kebing; Lai, Zijuan; Sangaraju, Dewakar; Kayagaki, Nobuhiko; Newton, Kim; Bogyo, Matthew; Staben, Steven T; Dixit, Vishva M",Cell,148,1

In Croatia, lockdown measures to curb virus spread lasted from March to May 2020, and all non-essential medical procedures and patients' visits have been cancelled. The study aimed to compare patients' flow and interventions in the surgical department before, during and after the lockdown period. Methods This cross-sectional study analysed the workload at the Maxillofacial and Oral Surgery Department (Department), Osijek University Hospital, during the COVID-19 pandemic (March-May 2020) and four subsequent months. The same period of 2019 was compared as a control. The data were subtracted from hospitals' electronic database. Results During COVID-19 lockdown from March to May 2020 the number of hospitalizations (306 vs. 138), surgical procedures (306 vs. 157), and scheduled outpatient visits (2009 vs. 804), dropped significantly as compared to 2019. The number of skin tumour removals was halved (from 155 in 2019 to 58 in 2019) (p<0.001), and the number of emergency patients was unchanged in the 3-month period. A significant decrease in outpatient visits and hospital admissions continued after the lockdown (p<0.001). Conclusion A decrease in the number of outpatient visits, hospitalizations, and tumour removals may result in larger proportions of patients with advanced cancers in the future. The second wave of COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing, and special effort must be paid to reduce the number of cancer patients receiving suboptimal treatment.","Kvolik Pavić, Ana; Zubčić, Vedran; Kvolik, Slavica","Medicinski glasnik : official publication of the Medical Association of Zenica-Doboj Canton, Bosnia and Herzegovina",148,20

It is noteworthy that autophagy is also associated with various pathophysiologic conditions in which this cellular process plays either a cytoprotective or cytopathic role in response to a variety of stresses such as metabolic, inflammatory, neurodegenerative, and therapeutic stress. It is now generally believed that modulating the activity of autophagy through targeting specific regulatory molecules in the autophagy machinery may impact disease processes, thus autophagy may represent a new pharmacologic target for drug development and therapeutic intervention of various human disorders. Induction or inhibition of autophagy using small molecule compounds has shown promise in the treatment of diseases such as cancer. Depending on context, induction or suppression of autophagy may exert therapeutic effects via promoting either cell survival or death, two major events targeted by therapies for various disorders. A better understanding of the biology of autophagy and the pharmacology of autophagy modulators has the potential for facilitating the development of autophagy-based therapeutic interventions for several human diseases.","Cheng, Yan; Ren, Xingcong; Hait, William N; Yang, Jin-Ming",Pharmacological reviews,148,16

We generalize the results of Heck and Wagenmakers (2016) by considering the case where the dimension of the auxiliary parameter space does not equal that of the primary parameter space. We present numerical methods for carrying out prior specification for statistical models that do not admit closed-form solutions. Taken together, these results provide researchers a more complete set of tools for setting prior distributions that could be applied to many cognitive and decision making models. We illustrate our approach by reanalyzing data under the Selective Integration model of Tsetsos et al. (2016). We find, via a Bayes factor analysis, that the selective integration model with all four parameters generally outperforms both the three-parameter variant (omitting early cognitive noise) and the w = 1 variant (omitting selective gating), as well as an unconstrained competitor model. By contrast, Tsetsos et al. found the three parameter variant to be the best performing in a BIC analysis (in the absence of a competitor).

METHODS On May 22, 2009, we performed LESS partial nephrectomy on a 7-year-old girl with a 3.5-cm renal mass. The surgery was performed using a homemade single-port device inserted through a single 3-cm umbilical incision. LESS partial nephrectomy was performed with hilar clamping and suturing of the renal defect. RESULTS The duration of the operation was 210 minutes, and the warm ischemic time was 42 minutes. The suturing required 35 minutes, and the estimated blood loss was 10 mL. Histopathological analysis revealed a 3.5-cm metanephric adenoma with a clean surgical margin. The patient was discharged without intraoperative or postoperative complications. On follow-up, Doppler ultrasound sonography showed the kidney was normal in appearance, size, and echogenicity. Split renal function was calculated to be 47.5% for the left kidney upon dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scintigraphy. CONCLUSIONS LESS partial nephrectomy was safe and feasible for removal of a renal mass in a child. Additional development of applicable instruments and refinement of the suturing technique are needed.","Jeon, Hwang Gyun; Kim, Dong Suk; Jeoung, Ha Bum; Han, Sang Won; Hong, Chang Hee; Im, Young Jae; Oh, Young Taek; Kim, Myung Joon; Han, Woong Kyu",Urology,148,16

Herein we examined network changes using graph theoretical analysis of high-density EEG during patient-titrated propofol-induced sedation. Responsiveness was used as a surrogate for consciousness. We divided the data into five states: baseline, transition into unresponsiveness, unresponsiveness, transition into responsiveness, and recovery. Power spectral analysis showed that delta power increased from responsiveness to unresponsiveness. In unresponsiveness, delta waves propagated from frontal to parietal regions as a traveling wave. Local increases in delta connectivity were evident in parietal but not frontal regions. Graph theory analysis showed that increased local efficiency could differentiate the levels of responsiveness. Interestingly, during transitions of responsive states, increased beta connectivity was noted relative to consciousness and unconsciousness, again with increased local efficiency. Abrupt network changes are evident in the transitions in responsiveness, with increased beta band power/connectivity marking transitions between responsive states, while the delta power/connectivity changes were consistent with the fading of consciousness using its surrogate responsiveness. These results provide novel insights into the neural correlates of these behavioural transitions and EEG signatures for monitoring the levels of consciousness under sedation.","Lee, Minji; Sanders, Robert D; Yeom, Seul-Ki; Won, Dong-Ok; Seo, Kwang-Suk; Kim, Hyun Jeong; Tononi, Giulio; Lee, Seong-Whan",Scientific reports,148,20

Indirect laryngoscopes may provide better glottic visualization in these groups of patients. Hence, we compared King Vision videolaryngoscope, C-MAC videolaryngoscope for endotracheal intubation in patients with proven/suspected cervical spine injury. METHODS After standard induction of anesthesia, 135 patients were randomized into three groups: group C (conventional C-MAC videolaryngoscope), group K (King Vision videolaryngoscope), and group D (D blade C-MAC videolaryngoscope). Cervical immobilization was maintained with Manual in line stabilization with anterior part of cervical collar removed. First pass intubation success, time for intubation, and glottic visualization (Cormack - Lehane grade and percentage of glottic opening) were noted. Intubation difficulty score (IDS) was used for grading difficulty of intubation. Five-point Likert scale was used for ease of insertion of laryngoscope. RESULTS First attempt success rate were 100% (45/45), 93.3% (42/45), and 95.6% (43/45) in patients using conventional C-MAC, King Vision, and D blade C-MAC videolaryngoscopes, respectively. Time for intubation in seconds was significantly faster with conventional C-MAC videolaryngoscope (23.3 ± 4.7) compared to D blade C-MAC videolaryngoscope (26.7 ± 7.1), whereas conventional C-MAC and King Vision were comparable (24.9 ± 7.2). Good grade glottic visualization was obtained with all the three videolaryngoscopes. CONCLUSION All the videolaryngoscopes provided good glottic visualization and first attempt success rate. Conventional C-MAC insertion was significantly easier. We conclude that all the three videolaryngoscopes can be used effectively in patients with cervical spine injury.","Shravanalakshmi, Dhanyasi; Bidkar, Prasanna U; Narmadalakshmi, K; Lata, Suman; Mishra, Sandeep K; Adinarayanan, S",Surgical neurology international,148,1

SUBJECTS Patients aged 18 or older with DME and/or PDR, nAMD, or RVO scheduled to be seen by a retina specialist during the mandated lock down period from March 14 - May 4, 2020 (COVID-19 period) and who had received an intravitreal injection in the 12 weeks prior. METHODS Chart review was performed and demographics, ophthalmic diagnoses, procedures performed, and visual acuity at all visits were recorded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Visual acuity in patients who completed, canceled, and no-showed for the COVID-19 period visit. RESULTS Of the 1,041 total patients in this study, 620 (60%) completed the scheduled visit, while 376 (36%) canceled and 45 (4%) were no-shows. In patients who missed the scheduled visit, the average delay in care was 5.34 weeks. In those who missed a visit, the visual acuity was assessed at the subsequent visit. Patients who canceled a visit were older, and patients who no-showed had lower baseline vision [mean EDTRS letters (±SE); no-show: 53.27 (±3.21), canceled: 60.79 (±1.11), completed: 62.81 (±0.84), p=0.0101] and were more likely to have DME and/or PDR [no-show: 13 (29%), canceled: 56 (16%), completed: 81 (13%), p=0.0456]. Patients who missed a visit lost more vision as compared to the patients who completed the scheduled visit [no-show: -5.024 (±1.88), canceled: -1.633 (±0.65), completed: 0.373 (±0.50), p=0.0028].

INDICATION anatomic or pathophysiologic indication includes venous diameter within 2-20 mm, reflux time ≥0.5 seconds and distance from the skin ≥5 mm or subfascial location. Access: it is recommended to access at or above the knee joint for great saphenous vein and above the mid-calf for small saphenous vein. Catheter placement: the catheter tip should be placed 2.0 cm inferior to the saphenofemoral or saphenopopliteal junction. Endovenous heat-induced thrombosis ≥class III should be treated with low-molecular weight heparin. Tumescent solution: the composition of solution can be variable (e.g., 2% lidocaine 20 mL+500 mL normal saline+bicarbonate 2.5 mL with/without epinephrine). Infiltration can be done from each direction. Ablation: two cycles' ablation for the first proximal segment of saphenous vein and the segment with the incompetent perforators is recommended. The other segments should be ablated one time. During RF energy delivery, it is recommended to apply external compression. Concomitant procedure: It is recommended to do simultaneously ambulatory phlebectomy. For sclerotherapy, it is recommended to defer at least 2 weeks. Post-procedural management: post-procedural ambulation is encouraged to reduce the thrombotic complications. Compression stocking should be applied for at least 7 days. Minor daily activity is not limited, but strenuous activities should be avoided for 2 weeks. It is suggested to take showers after 24 hours and tub baths, swimming, or soaking in water after 2 weeks.","Joh, Jin Hyun; Kim, Woo-Shik; Jung, In Mok; Park, Ki-Hyuk; Lee, Taeseung; Kang, Jin Mo",Vascular specialist international,148,19

We aimed to examine whether the effect of escitalopram on PSD differs according to individual depressive symptoms and stroke lesion location. METHODS This is a post hoc analysis of EMOTION (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01278498), a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial that examined the efficacy of escitalopram on depression in acute stroke patients (237 with placebo, 241 with escitalopram). Depressive symptoms were evaluated with the 10-item Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Changes in MADRS and individual item scores at 12 weeks were compared between the treatment groups and among the stroke lesion location groups. Stroke lesion locations were grouped according to the anatomical distribution of serotonin fibers that originate from the midbrain/pons and spread to the forebrain via subcortical structures: ""Midbrain-Pons,"" ""Frontal-Subcortical,"" and ""Others."" Least-squares means were calculated to demonstrate the independent effect of lesion location. RESULTS Total MADRS scores decreased more significantly in the escitalopram than in the placebo group, while a significant effect of escitalopram was observed in only 3 items: apparent sadness, reported sadness, pessimistic thoughts. In the lesion location analyses, escitalopram users in the Frontal-Subcortical group showed significant improvement in total MADRS scores (placebo [n = 130] vs. escitalopram [n = 148], least-square mean [95% CI]: -2.3 [-3.5 to -0.2] vs. -4.5 [-5.5 to -3.4], p = .005), while those in the Midbrain-Pons and Others groups did not. CONCLUSIONS The effect of escitalopram on PSD may be more prominent in patients with particular depressive symptoms and stroke lesion locations, suggesting the need for tailored treatment strategies.","Lee, Eun-Jae; Kim, Jong S; Chang, Dae-Il; Park, Jong-Ho; Ahn, Seong Hwan; Cha, Jae-Kwan; Heo, Ji Hoe; Sohn, Sung-Il; Lee, Byung-Chul; Kim, Dong-Eog; Kim, Hahn Young; Kim, Seongheon; Kwon, Do-Young; Kim, Jei; Seo, Woo-Keun; Lee, Jun; Park, Sang-Won; Koh, Seong-Ho; Kim, Jin Young; Choi-Kwon, Smi; Kim, Min-Sun; Lee, Ji-Sung",Journal of geriatric psychiatry and neurology,148,28

Our objective was to study amiodarone uptake, clarify the origin of vacuoles, and investigate the effect of amiodarone on the life cycle of the coronavirus responsible for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which, to enter cells, relies on the proteolytic cleavage of a viral spike protein by the endosomal proteinase cathepsin L. Using alveolar macrophages, we studied uptake of (125)I-amiodarone and (125)I-B2, an analog lacking the lateral group diethylamino-beta-ethoxy, and analyzed the effects of amiodarone on the distribution of endosomal markers and on the uptake of an acidotropic dye. Furthermore, using Vero cells, we tested the impact of amiodarone on the in vitro spreading of the SARS coronavirus. We found that (1) amiodarone associates with different cell membranes and accumulates in acidic organelles; (2) the diethylamino-beta-ethoxy group is an important determinant of uptake; (3) vacuoles forming upon exposure to amiodarone are enlarged late endosomes; (4) amiodarone inhibits the spreading in vitro of SARS coronavirus; and (5) trypsin cleavage of the viral spike protein before infection, which permits virus entry through the plasma membrane, does not impair amiodarone antiviral activity. We conclude that amiodarone alters late compartments of the endocytic pathway and inhibits SARS coronavirus infection by acting after the transit of the virus through endosomes.","Stadler, Konrad; Ha, Huy Riem; Ciminale, Vincenzo; Spirli, Carlo; Saletti, Giulietta; Schiavon, Marco; Bruttomesso, Daniela; Bigler, Laurent; Follath, Ferenc; Pettenazzo, Andrea; Baritussio, Aldo",American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology,148,1

Retrieval of an embolized device may often be complicated by failure to introduce the right atrial (RA) disk hub into the sheath or difficulty in securely grasping the hub pin of RA disk. We aimed to evaluate the efficiency and success rate of device retrieval using a novel double snare technique. METHODS We reviewed retrieval procedures of embolized atrial septal defect (ASD) or left atrial appendage (LAA) occluder using double snare technique reported from five tertiary referral centers in Korea, Japan, and Uzbekistan. A total of 16 retrieval procedures in 15 patients were reported, including 14 patients who were planned for ASD device closure while 1 patient was planned for LA appendage occlusion. RESULTS Retrieved devices included 15 ASD occluders from six different manufacturers and one Amplantzer cardiac plug. Success rate of retrieval procedure was 100% using the double snare technique. There were no complications related to device retrieval. Most (15/16, 93.8%) of these devices could be retrieved through their original delivery sheaths. In six patients for whom retrieval was unsuccessful with conventional single snare technique and switched to double snare technique, the retrieval time was shortened significantly (P = 0.004*) by using the double snare technique. CONCLUSIONS The double snare technique enables effective retrieval of various embolized devices. It abolishes the need of changing the sheath to a larger one in most patients.","Ha, Kee Soo; Choi, Jae Young; Jung, Se Yong; Kim, Jung-Sun; Byun, Ki Hyun; Akagi, Teiji; Zufarov, Mirjamol M",Journal of interventional cardiology,148,5

Both syndromes are caused by a critical stenosis or a total occlusion of coronary arteries (mostly due to thrombosis on atherosclerotic plaque), and manifest with a similar clinical presentation. Recent epidemiologic studies show that the relative incidence of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) moves in an opposite fashion (decreasing and increasing respectively), with a prognosis that is worse at short-term follow-up for STEMI but comparable at long-term. Current management differs, as for STEMIs an immediate reperfusion is recommended, while for NSTEMIs risk stratification is mandatory in order to stratify patients' risk, and then decide the timing for coronary angiography. Periprocedural and technical aspects of the interventional management as well antithrombotic medications are for the most similarly implemented in the two types of MI, with routine radial access, DES implant, and novel P2Y12 inhibitors representing the standard of care in both cases. The following review article aims to compare the two types of MI, with and without persistent ST-segment elevation. The main purpose is to explore their similarities and differences and address areas of uncertainty with regards to clinical presentation, therapeutic management, and prognosis. The identification of high-risk NSTEMI patients is important as they may require an individualised approach that can substantially overlap with current STEMI recommendations and their mortality remains high if their management is delayed.","Mitsis, Andreas; Gragnano, Felice",Current cardiology reviews,148,22

The pathogenesis of COVID-19 starts with the bonding of the virus to ACE-2 receptors expressed in many tissues, and the triggered excessive immune response plays a critical role in the course of the disease. The cytokine storm that occurs upon excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines is considered responsible for the severe progression of the disease and the organ damage. However, the accurate pathophysiological mechanism of the disease, which progresses with various clinical presentations, is still substantially unknown. While various studies have been conducted on the effect of genetic polymorphism on the course and severity of the disease, the presence of a significant effect has not been proven yet. The clinical course of the disease is variable, with clinical representation ranging from 81% mild course to 14% severe course along with 5% critical course in patients. Asymptomatic course is considered to be higher than expected, although its frequency is not known exactly. Older adults and those with comorbidities are exposed to a more severe disease course. The disease progress with various symptoms, such as fever, cough, dyspnea, malaise, myalgia, taste and smell dysfunctions, diarrhea, and headache. A range of complications (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, thromboembolic conditions, arrhythmia and cardiac events, secondary infections) could be seen during the course of the disease. Varied laboratory tests are vital to determine the severity and prognosis of the disease, along with the condition and exposure of the affected systems during the course of COVID-19.","Öztürk, Recep",Turkish journal of medical sciences,148,1

Any improvement in functional outcome distribution has value, and herein we provide an assessment of the effect of alteplase on the distribution of the functional level by treatment delay, age, and stroke severity. METHODS Prespecified pooled analysis of 6756 patients from 9 randomized trials comparing alteplase versus placebo/open control. Ordinal logistic regression models assessed treatment differences after adjustment for treatment delay, age, stroke severity, and relevant interaction term(s). RESULTS Treatment with alteplase was beneficial for a delay in treatment extending to 4.5 hours after stroke onset, with a greater benefit with earlier treatment. Neither age nor stroke severity significantly influenced the slope of the relationship between benefit and time to treatment initiation. For the observed case mix of patients treated within 4.5 hours of stroke onset (mean 3 hours and 20 minutes), the net absolute benefit from alteplase (ie, the difference between those who would do better if given alteplase and those who would do worse) was 55 patients per 1000 treated (95% confidence interval, 13-91; P=0.004). CONCLUSIONS Treatment with intravenous alteplase initiated within 4.5 hours of stroke onset increases the chance of achieving an improved level of function for all patients across the age spectrum, including the over 80s and across all severities of stroke studied (top versus bottom fifth means: 22 versus 4); the earlier that treatment is initiated, the greater the benefit.","Lees, Kennedy R; Emberson, Jonathan; Blackwell, Lisa; Bluhmki, Erich; Davis, Stephen M; Donnan, Geoffrey A; Grotta, James C; Kaste, Markku; von Kummer, Rüdiger; Lansberg, Maarten G; Lindley, Richard I; Lyden, Patrick; Murray, Gordon D; Sandercock, Peter A G; Toni, Danilo; Toyoda, Kazunori; Wardlaw, Joanna M; Whiteley, William N; Baigent, Colin; Hacke, Werner; Howard, George",Stroke,148,5

Besides their abilities for self-homing, the drug loaded nanovesicles showed anti-cell proliferative effects via the generation of reactive oxygen species. Results: The nanovesicles demonstrated efficient internalization via homologous targeting. Delivery of PDTC showed a higher killing effect for homologous cell targeting than other cell types. Experimental results demonstrated increased antiproliferative potency of PDTC, which induced apoptosis via reactive oxygen species generation.

In early April 2020, at the epidemic peak, there were more than 33,000 patients hospitalized including more than 4,000 in Intensive Care Units (ICU). On May 15, the confirmed cases in Italy approached 224,000 patients (5th highest number worldwide), with more than 31,000 deaths (3rd highest number worldwide). Non-urgent, non-cancer procedures were stopped to reallocate nurses and anesthetists to face the COVID-19 emergency. The timeline of the progressive involvement by COVID-19 patients of 36 hospitals referrals for surgical oncology in Italy was shown in this article. Only emergency, and elective oncological procedures were allowed with obvious limitations in terms of numbers of operable cases. Criteria for prioritizing oncologic patients waiting for surgery were released by each region, mainly issuing main factors for decision making, biological aggressiveness or symptomatic disease, the interval from the latest treatment, and the risk of un-resectability if delayed. However, the lack of facilities mostly influenced the decision or not to proceed. The risk of operating on oncological patients with ongoing SARS-CoV-2 syndrome is real, and a preoperative flowchart for ruling out this occurrence has been promoted. In our center, the day before surgery, chest CT and swab testing have been introduced, and a similar behavior has been recommended prior to patients' discharge. The care of patients addressed for surgical oncology should be featured by dedicated paths to secure proper and prompt disease management.","Torzilli, Guido; Galvanin, Jacopo; Viganò, Luca; Donadon, Matteo; Montorsi, Marco",Global health & medicine,148,1

Current evidence suggests the association of COVID-19 infection in pregnancy with both severe maternal morbidity requiring intensive care and perinatal complications (preterm birth with consequent neonatal morbidity and even perinatal death). Most of the reported cases focused specifically on the maternal outcomes and possible vertical transmission, but less attention has been paid to fetus as a patient in such pregnancies. The use of antenatal steroids and fetal neuroprotection with magnesium sulfate is clearly underreported. Several recently issued guidelines suggest lowering the upper gestational age for antenatal steroid administration and also advocate extreme caution or even restraining from the use of magnesium sulfate.

The technological features of the method are demonstrated by transforming Au micro/nanostrip arrays into 3D half-turn helices. The metasurface formed by an array of 3D half-turn Au microhelices in the surface layer of a polymer substrate rotates the polarization plane of transmitted 3-THz radiation through an angle in excess of 50°. Both experimentally and numerically, it is established that the metasurface permits to control the state of polarization and the intensity of transmitted linearly polarized THz radiation using half-wavelength and guided-mode resonances as well as diffraction effects. The proposed approach enables the fabrication of double-layer arrays of half-helices, designed for infrared metasurfaces, from 80-nm wide Au nanostrips. These studies not only pave the way towards the fabrication of large-area chiral metamaterials but, also, open a new avenue in the development of 3D micro/nanostructures for other applications.","Golod, Sergey Vladislavovich; Gayduk, Alexey E; Kurus, Nina N; Kubarev, Vitaly; Prinz, V Ya",Nanotechnology,148,1

J Strength Cond Res 30(7): 1992-2000, 2016-Compression sleeves (CS) and kinesiology tape (KT) are purported to enhance proprioception, however, there is substantial conflict in the literature. Because the beneficial effects of CS and KT are more evident in the literature with recovery, the objective of this study was to examine the effects of CS and KT on balance under acute nonfatigued and postfatigued conditions. Using a within-subject, repeated-measures design, 12 university participants (5 females and 7 males) performed in a random order CS, KT, and Control conditions. Two trials of each test were conducted before the application of CS or KT (pretest 1), immediately after the application (pretest 2), with posttests at 1 and 10 minutes after 4 sets of unilateral Bulgarian squats to failure (1 minute rest between sets). Tests included a Y balance test (measures: distance reached by nondominant foot in anterior, posterior lateral, and posterior medial directions) and drop jump landing balance test from a 50-cm platform (measures: ground reaction force, electromyography, and center of pressure). The fatigue protocol induced 25.3% decrease in unilateral squat repetitions from set 1 to set 4. There were no significant condition main effects or interactions for any balance measure or EMG before or after fatigue. In conclusion, independent of fatigue, there was no significant effect of CS or KT on balance outcomes immediately and up to 10 minutes following the fatiguing intervention. Thus, nonfatigued or muscles weakened by fatigue did not benefit from CS and KT application.","Cavanaugh, M Tyler; Quigley, Patrick J; Hodgson, Daniel D; Reid, Jonathan C; Behm, David G",Journal of strength and conditioning research,148,24

We aimed to determine the relationship between laterality of acute intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) and poor clinical outcomes. METHODS A subsidiary analysis of the INTERACT Pilot and INTERACT2 studies--randomised controlled trials of patients with spontaneous acute ICH with elevated systolic blood pressure (BP), randomly assigned to intensive (target systolic BP <140 mm Hg) or guideline-based (<180 mm Hg) BP management. Outcomes were the combined and separate end points of death and major disability (modified Rankin scale (mRS) scores of 3-6, 6 and 3-5, respectively) at 90 days. RESULTS A total of 2708 patients had supratentorial/hemispheric ICH and information on mRS at 90 days. Patients with right hemispheric ICH (1327, 49%) had a higher risk of death at 90 days compared to those with left hemispheric ICH after adjustment for potential confounding variables (OR, 1.77 (95% CI 1.33 to 2.37)). There were no differences between patients with right and left hemispheric ICH regarding the combined end point of death or major disability or major disability in the multivariable-adjusted models (1.07 (0.89 to 1.29) and 0.85 (0.72 to 1.01), respectively). CONCLUSIONS Right hemispheric lesion was associated with increased risk of death in patients with acute ICH. The laterality of the ICH does not appear to affect the level of disability in survivors.

Methods Transparent collagen plates were prepared in dry and wet conditions. Physical properties of collagen plates and porcine colon tissue were examined using a rheometer. Adjustable and fixed-type circular staplers were applied on the collagen plates and the gap distance and compressive pressure were measured during anvil approximation. Tissue injury was evaluated using a compression injury scale. Compression properties were accessed to optimal or overcompression based on gap distance. Results Unacceptable injuries were rarely observed on the dry collagens, regardless of compression device. In the adjustable compression, the compressibility ratio was similar between dry and wet collagen. Overcompression and unacceptable injury increased on the wet collagens. In the fixed compression, the compressibility ratio increased significantly and unacceptable injuries were observed in more than 50% of wet collagens. Peak pressure was significantly higher in the fixed-compression types than those of adjustable type. On bivariate correlation analysis, fixed-compression type and wet collagens were respectively associated with overcompression. On multivariate analysis, edematous collagen condition was the most important risk factor and proximal anvil side, fixed compression type, and overcompression were also independent risk factors for unacceptable compression injury. Conclusion In the edematous tissue condition, unintentional overcompression could be increased and result in tissue injury on the compression line of the circular stapler.","Son, Gyung Mo; Kwon, Myeong Sook; Ahn, Hong-Min; Lee, In Young; Kim, Gun Ho; Nam, Kyoung Won; Lee, JoonWon; Kong, Chang-Suk",Annals of surgical treatment and research,148,16

The coordinated response by Justice Health and Forensic Mental Health Network (The Network) undertaken with the support of NSW Ministry of Health, in partnership with Corrective Services NSW (CSNSW), Youth Justice and private jails has ensured that the NSW correctional system has remained otherwise COVID-free. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH A research study of how a range of partners which support the operations of NSW Correctional System developed an effective approach for the prevention a COVID-19 epidemic amongst its inmates. FINDINGS Establishment of effective partnerships, early coordination of representatives from all aspects of the NSW correctional system, limited access to the correctional environment, reduced prison population and strict isolation of all new receptions have all contributed to maintaining this COVID-free status despite other NSW settings with similar risk profiles, such as aged care facilities and cruise ship arrivals, experiencing serious outbreaks. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS Although Australia/New Zealand context of suppressed community infection rates for COVID-19 (which are approaching elimination in some jurisdictions) is in contrast to the situation in other parts of the world, the principles described in this paper will be useful to most other correctional systems. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS Modelling was used to underline our approach and reinforced the veracity of following this approach. ORIGINALITY/VALUE The Network and CSNSW has been able to mount an effective, integrated response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has been sustainable through the first peak of COVID-19 cases.

As a result, there has been a parallel growth in late complications associated with the sequelae from the underlying cardiac anomalies as well as the surgical and other interventional treatments. AREAS COVERED Here, we review challenges related to an aging population of patients with TOF, particularly late complications, and highlight advances in management and key areas for future research. Pulmonary regurgitation, heart failure, arrhythmias, and aortic complications are some of these late complications. There is also a growing incidence of acquired cardiovascular disease, obesity, and diabetes associated with aging. Management of these late complications and acquired comorbidities continues to evolve as research provides insights into long-term outcomes from medical therapies and surgical interventions. EXPERT OPINION The management of an aging TOF population will continue to transform with advances in imaging technologies to identify subclinical disease and valve replacement technologies that will prevent and mitigate disease progression. In coming years, we speculate there will be more data to support the use of novel heart failure therapies in TOF and consensus guidelines on management of refractory arrhythmias and aortic complications.","Woo, Jennifer P; McElhinney, Doff B; Lui, George K",Expert review of cardiovascular therapy,148,1

Interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) are innate effector proteins restricting host cell entry of many enveloped viruses, including HCV. However, the clinical impact of IFITMs on HCV immune escape remains to be determined. Here, we show that IFITMs promote viral escape from the neutralizing antibody (nAb) response in clinical cohorts of HCV-infected patients. Using pseudoparticles bearing HCV envelope proteins from acutely infected patients, we show that HCV variants isolated preseroconversion are more sensitive to the antiviral activity of IFITMs than variants from patients isolated during chronic infection postseroconversion. Furthermore, HCV variants escaping nAb responses during liver transplantation exhibited a significantly higher resistance to IFITMs than variants that were eliminated posttransplantation. Gain-of-function and mechanistic studies revealed that IFITMs markedly enhance the antiviral activity of nAbs and suggest a cooperative effect of human monoclonal antibodies and IFITMs for antibody-mediated neutralization driving the selection pressure in viral evasion. Perturbation studies with the IFITM antagonist amphotericin B revealed that modulation of membrane properties by IFITM proteins is responsible for the IFITM-mediated blockade of viral entry and enhancement of antibody-mediated neutralization. Conclusion: Our results indicate IFITM proteins as drivers of viral immune escape and antibody-mediated HCV neutralization in acute and chronic HCV infection. These findings are of clinical relevance for the design of urgently needed HCV B-cell vaccines and might help to increase the efficacy of future vaccine candidates.","Wrensch, Florian; Ligat, Gaëtan; Heydmann, Laura; Schuster, Catherine; Zeisel, Mirjam B; Pessaux, Patrick; Habersetzer, François; King, Barnabas J; Tarr, Alexander W; Ball, Jonathan K; Winkler, Michael; Pöhlmann, Stefan; Keck, Zhen-Yong; Foung, Steven K H; Baumert, Thomas F",Hepatology,148,1

Results Pearson correlations revealed that a composite of CCC-2 structural language scales, but not pragmatic language scales, was significantly correlated with the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System-Second Edition Global Adaptive Composite, Conceptual, and Practical domains. Further investigation utilizing hierarchical regression analyses identified only the Speech scale on the CCC-2 as contributing unique variance to the prediction of adaptive behavior scores in the Global Adaptive Composite, Conceptual, and Practical domains.

Thus, female predisposition to pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) is an inevitable topic. To better understand the nature of sexual differentiation in the pulmonary circulation, and how heritable factors, in vivo- and/or in vitro-altered estrogen circumstances and changes in the live environment work in concert to discern the sex bias, this chapter reviews pulmonary events characterized by sex-different features, concomitant with exploration of how alterations of genetic expression and estrogen metabolisms trigger the female-predominant pathological signaling. We address the following: PAH (Sect.7.2) is characterized as an estrogenic promotion of its incidence (Sect. 7.2.2), as a function of specific germline mutations, and as an estrogen-elicited protection of its prognosis (Sect.7.2.1). More detail is provided to introduce a less recognized gene of Ephx2 that encodes soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) to degrade epoxyeicosatrienic acids (EETs). As a susceptible target of estrogen, Ephx2/sEH expression is downregulated by an estrogen-dependent epigenetic mechanism. Increases in pulmonary EETs then evoke a potentiation of PAH generation, but mitigation of its progression, a phenomenon similar to the estrogen-paradox regulation of PAH. Additionally, the female susceptibility to chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (Sect. 7.3) and asthma (Sect.7.4), but less preference to COVID-19 (Sect. 7.5), and roles of estrogen in their pathogeneses are briefly discussed.","Huang, An; Kandhi, Sharath; Sun, Dong",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,148,1

Translational arrest is a common antiviral strategy used by hosts. In response, RVFV inhibits two well-known antiviral pathways that attenuate translation during infection, PKR and type I IFN signaling. Despite this, translational arrest occurs during RVFV infection by unknown mechanisms. Here, we find that RVFV infection triggers the decay of core translation machinery mRNAs that possess a 5'-terminal oligopyrimidine (5'-TOP) motif in their 5'-UTR, including mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins, which leads to a decrease in overall ribosomal protein levels. We find that the RNA decapping enzyme NUDT16 selectively degrades 5'-TOP mRNAs during RVFV infection and this decay is triggered in response to mTOR attenuation via the translational repressor 4EBP1/2 axis. Translational arrest of 5'-TOPs via 4EBP1/2 restricts RVFV replication, and this increased RNA decay results in the loss of visible RNA granules, including P bodies and stress granules. Because RVFV cap-snatches in RNA granules, the increased level of 5'-TOP mRNAs in this compartment leads to snatching of these targets, which are translationally suppressed during infection. Therefore, translation of RVFV mRNAs is compromised by multiple mechanisms during infection. Together, these data present a previously unknown mechanism for translational shutdown in response to viral infection and identify mTOR attenuation as a potential therapeutic avenue against bunyaviral infection.","Hopkins, Kaycie C; Tartell, Michael A; Herrmann, Christin; Hackett, Brent A; Taschuk, Frances; Panda, Debasis; Menghani, Sanjay V; Sabin, Leah R; Cherry, Sara",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,148,28

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has provided funding for evidence-based behavioral interventions (EBIs) at health departments and community-based organizations (CBOs) since 2004. From 2006 to 2015, CDC funded 25 CBOs to evaluate one or more of seven EBIs designed to prevent HIV through the Community-based Organization Behavioral Outcomes Project (CBOP) as implemented outside of a research setting. For each EBI, CBOP showed that most HIV risk behaviors improved after the intervention, and improvements were similar to those observed in research studies. Our findings show that behavioral interventions can be successfully implemented in real-world settings. Although the focus of HIV prevention has largely shifted toward biomedical interventions in recent years, successful implementation often depends on behavioral components. Lessons from CBOP can inform future efforts to develop and implement behavioral interventions for HIV and other areas of public health.","Williams, Weston O; Uhl, Gary; Eke, Adanze; Fisher, Holly; Joshua, Tanesha; Heitgerd, Janet; Marano, Mariette; Moore, Andrea; Sapiano, Tobey; Shelley, Gene; Stein, Renee",AIDS and behavior,148,1

The purpose of this study was to develop a low-fidelity, low-cost, reusable and portable simulation device, which could provide training in nearly the full range of mitral valve surgery techniques, in both the classic, open approach as well as the minimally invasive approach. METHODS This novel simulator is made up of commonly available components. The basic elements are a classic baby bottle, with the associated feeding teat and screw ring, in combination with a sheet of dental dam. The detailed process for making this simulator is outlined in this article. Maximum suture tensile strength on the different components was tested with a digital force gauge. Reusability and the rate of wear as a result of suturing were documented. Total cost was calculated in euros (€). RESULTS This study resulted in a simulation model very similar in size to the actual anatomical dimensions of the mitral valve. Various pathological conditions, according to Carpentier's Functional Classification, could be simulated. This led to the possibility of providing training in several mitral valve surgical techniques. As the model developed, it became clear that it could also be used to practice tricuspid valve surgery techniques. Maximum mean suture tensions on the silicone teat and dental dam were 42.11 and 11.15 N/m(2), respectively. The feeding teat started wearing after approximately 45 suture placements. Total cost of the study model was €5.14. CONCLUSIONS This relatively simple, low-cost, low-fidelity model can provide simulation training in nearly the full range of mitral valve and tricuspid valve surgical techniques, in both the classic open approach and the minimally invasive approach-and do so almost anywhere. Especially when used by young cardiothoracic surgeons in training, this model may contribute to the development of technical skills and procedural knowledge required for adequate performance in the operating room.","Verberkmoes, Niels J; Verberkmoes-Broeders, Elizabeth M P C",Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery,148,1

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Studies evaluating prevalence of LBP in adult athletes across all sports. RESULTS Eighty-six studies were included (30 732, range 20-5958, participants), of which 45 were of 'high' quality. Definitions of LBP varied widely, and in 17 studies, no definition was provided. High-quality studies were pooled and the mean point prevalence across six studies was 42%; range 18%-80% (95% CI 27% to 58%, I2=97%). Lifetime prevalence across 13 studies was 63%; range 36%-88% (95% CI 51% to 74%, I2=99%). Twelve-month LBP prevalence from 22 studies was 51%; range 12%-94% (95% CI 41% to 61%, I2=98%). Comparison across sports was limited by participant numbers, study quality and methodologies, and varying LBP definitions. Risk factors for LBP included history of a previous episode with a pooled OR of 3.5; range 1.6-4.0 (95% CI 1.9 to 6.4). Statistically significant associations were reported for high training volume, periods of load increase and years of exposure to the sport. CONCLUSION LBP in sport is common but estimates vary. Current evidence is insufficient to identify which sports are at highest risk. A previous episode of LBP, high training volume, periods of load increase and years of exposure are common risk factors.","Wilson, Fiona; Ardern, Clare L; Hartvigsen, Jan; Dane, Kathryn; Trompeter, Katharina; Trease, Larissa; Vinther, Anders; Gissane, Conor; McDonnell, Sarah-Jane; Caneiro, J P; Newlands, Craig; Wilkie, Kellie; Mockler, David; Thornton, Jane S",British journal of sports medicine,148,17

Anastomotic leakage is still a reason for laparotomy; applying a diverting stoma or performing a Hartman's procedure is common [1, 2]. Laparoscopic treatment of an early-detected anastomotic leakage is suggested from other authors [3, 4]. In our video we demonstrate a combined minimal invasive transabdominal and transanal treatment concept in patients with early-detected anastomotic leakage. METHODS Two consecutive patients developing an anastomotic leakage after single-port laparoscopic sigmoid resection for stage II/III diverticulitis (Hanson & Stock) were treated with a combined minimal invasive approach. Anastomotic leakage was diagnosed by triple contrast computed tomography on postoperative day 4 in patient one and on postoperative day 7 in patient two. Operative treatment was performed immediately on the same day without delay. RESULTS In both patients a combined transanal and transabdominal approach was performed. First step was a diagnostic laparoscopy in order to exclude fecal peritonitis. Using a single-port device (SILS Port Covidien), transanal inspection of the anastomosis was also performed: In both patients anastomotic tissue margins were vital, and the leakage affected only a quarter of the anastomotic circumference. Transanal stitches were placed to close the anastomotic leakage. Laparoscopic transabdominal irrigation was performed, and two suction drainages were placed in the pelvis. Postoperative antibiotic treatment and a gradual return to slid food were carried out. Functional result at follow-up of 102 and 112 days (with rectoscopy) showed no residual leak and no stricture of the anastomosis, and both of patients had a normal rectal function.","Brunner, Walter; Rossetti, Andrea; Vines, Larissa Clea; Kalak, Nabil; Bischofberger, Stephan Andreas",Surgical endoscopy,148,1

The physical and emotional condition of individuals with pain sensitization syndromes who are experiencing the pandemic may worsen. This study investigated the contribution of life changes due to the coronavirus to emotional distress in individuals with a diagnosis of chronic central sensitization pain and tested whether the associations between level of pain and sensitization were independent of or mediated by emotional distress. METHODS Spanish individuals with chronic pain (N = 362) completed an online survey on direct or indirect exposure to the consequences of COVID-19, pain intensity, and emotional distress. They also completed central sensitization questionnaires. RESULTS An association was found between changes in daily routines and pain intensity, emotional distress, and sensitization scores. Correlations were found between emotional distress, sensitization, and pain intensity. Significant predictors of emotional distress were age, difficulty in receiving medical care, changes in daily routines, and diminished social support. Emotional distress did not mediate the association between sensitization and pain intensity. CONCLUSION Due to the COVID-19 situation, individuals with central sensitization pain syndromes may be at higher risk of developing psychological distress. Interdisciplinary interventions involving psychologists are urgently needed to provide this population with appropriate health care.","Serrano-Ibáñez, Elena R; Esteve, Rosa; Ramírez-Maestre, Carmen; Ruiz-Párraga, Gema T; López-Martínez, Alicia E",British journal of health psychology,148,16

While mounting evidence demonstrates the safety and efficacy of bariatric surgery for severely obese adolescents, the potential role of robotic technology has not been well defined. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to establish the safety and efficacy of robotic-assisted laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (RSG) in treating severe adolescent obesity. In addition, 30-day outcomes and hospital charges were compared to subjects undergoing RSG versus laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). METHODS A retrospective analysis of 28 subjects (14 LSG vs. 14 RSG) at a single institution was conducted. Data collection included demographics, body mass index, comorbidities, hospital length of stay (LOS), operative time, 30-day outcomes, and hospital charges. Analysis was performed using chi-square, Fisher's exact, and nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum tests. RESULTS There were no differences in subject demographics or comorbidities. While median operative time was longer for RSG vs. LSG (132 vs. 100 min, p = 0.0002), the median LOS for RSG compared to LSG was shorter (69.6 vs. 75.9 h, p = 0.0094). In addition, RSG-related hospital charges were higher ($56,646 vs. $49,498, p = 0.0366). No significant differences in post-operative outcomes or complications were observed. CONCLUSIONS RSG is equally safe and efficacious when compared to LSG among adolescents. Similar to studies in adults, LOS is shortened while hospital charges are higher. Larger prospective studies are needed to gain insight regarding cost benefit ratios.","Pepper, Victoria K; Rager, Terrence M; Diefenbach, Karen A; Raval, Mehul V; Teich, Steven; Michalsky, Marc P",Obesity surgery,148,17

Characterized by the irrationally indexed e-reflections in the diffraction pattern, e-labradorite shows the largest variation in the incommensurate ordering states among the e-plagioclase structures. The strongly ordered low-temperature e-labradorite is one of the last missing pieces of the e-plagioclase puzzle. Nine plutonic and metamorphic labradorite feldspar samples from Canada, Ukraine, Minnesota (USA), Tanzania and Greenland with compositions ranging from An52.5 to An68 were studied with single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Two crystals from Labrador, Canada, and Duluth, MN, USA, with wide enough twin lamellae were analyzed with single-crystal neutron diffraction. The incommensurately modulated structures of e-plagioclase are refined for the first time with neutron diffraction data, which confirmed that the T-O distance modulation in the low-temperature e-plagioclase results from the Al-Si ordering in the framework. Detailed configurations of the M site are also observed in the structures refined from neutron diffraction data, which were not possible to see with X-ray diffraction data. The relation between the q-vectors and the mole% An composition is revealed for the entire compositional range of e-plagioclase, from An25 to An75. The previously proposed two-trend relation depending on the cooling rate and phase transition path is confirmed. A new classification of e-plagioclase (eα, eβ and eγ) is proposed based on the q-vector of the structure, which makes it an independent character from the presence/absence of density modulation. New parameters are proposed to quantify the ordering states of these complicated aperiodic structures of e-plagioclases, such as the difference between 〈T1o-O〉 and 〈T1m-O〉 at phase t = 0.2 or the normalized intensity of the (071\bar 1) reflection.","Jin, Shiyun; Xu, Huifang; Wang, Xiaoping; Jacobs, Ryan; Morgan, Dane","Acta crystallographica Section B, Structural science, crystal engineering and materials",148,0

MATERIALS AND METHODS Computed tomographically guided nephrostomy was performed in 1 kidney in each of 14 female pigs by placing a 6F nephrostomy catheter. Pyeloperfusion was performed through infusion of cooled 5% of glucose solution via the nephrostomy catheter (4°C; 10 mL/min). Microwave ablation (915 MHz) was performed at 45 W for 10 minutes in the irrigated and the non-irrigated kidneys creating a central lesion and a peripheral lesion in each kidney. Maximum ablation diameters were measured and ablation volumes were calculated after the animals were killed. The extent of thermal injury of the renal pyelon was assessed histopathologically in the slice of maximal thermal injury on a 10-point scale ranging from 0 (none) to 10 (complete). RESULTS Pyeloperfusion did not impact the ablation volume or the degree of thermal injury to the collecting system for the central or peripheral MWA procedures: The mean (SD) volume of the MWA zones was equivalent for the irrigated versus non-irrigated kidneys for the peripheral (3.07 [2.39] mL vs 3.87 [3.08] mL) and central MWA procedures (2.26 [1.55] mL vs 2.40 [1.60] mL). The mean (SD) histologic scores of the thermal damage of the pyelon were similar for the irrigated versus non-irrigated kidneys in the peripheral MWA (1.0 [2.7] vs 0.2 [0.6]) and in the central MWA (1.6 [2.7] vs 3.4 [3.4]). CONCLUSIONS In MWA, cooled antegrade pyeloperfusion is not useful to modulate the ablation volume in peripheral or central locations. Accordingly, pyeloperfusion may not be useful as a protective measure to avoid thermal damage in MWA of the kidney. Therefore, MWA of central renal tumors does not seem advisable.","Isfort, Peter; Penzkofer, Tobias; Tanaka, Toshihiro; Bruners, Philipp; Westphal, Saskia; Kennes, Lieven N; Schmitz-Rode, Thomas; Kuhl, Christiane K; Mahnken, Andreas H",Investigative radiology,148,1

Materials and Methods: Chiricahua Community Health Centers, Inc., a federally qualified health center in southeastern Arizona, conducted phone surveys with 562 patients to measure various outcomes related to patient satisfaction and experience with telehealth between June and August 2020. Data from patient surveys were analyzed within the following age categories: <18 years (37%), 18-34 years (19%), 35-54 years (15%), and 55+ years (29%). Results and Discussion: Patients were overall satisfied with telehealth (87%) and believed the quality of care was just as good as or better than in-person appointments (88%). Many would be willing to try telehealth in the future (54%). Distance/convenience (odds ratio [OR] = 5.01, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.80-8.97), ease of scheduling (OR = 3.82, 95% CI 1.30-11.21), and protection from potential exposure to coronavirus (OR = 3.01, 95% CI 1.57-5.75) were all strongly predictive of overall satisfaction scores.

As the number of peer-to-peer OSGs for chronic musculoskeletal conditions grows, it is important to gain insight into the different designs of groups available, who is accessing them, if and how they may be effective, and what strategies are being used to implement or increase consumer engagement. OBJECTIVE The objectives of this systematic review of people with musculoskeletal conditions were to (1) describe the design features (functions, usage options, moderation, and expert input) of peer-to-peer OSGs, (2) describe the characteristics of the individuals using peer-to-peer OSGs, (3) synthesize the evidence on outcomes of participation, and (4) identify strategies used in the delivery and maintenance of OSGs. METHODS A search comprising terms related to the population (people with musculoskeletal disorders) and the intervention (peer-to-peer OSGs) was conducted in 6 databases. Results were filtered from 1990 (internet inception) to February 2019. Studies identified in the search were screened according to predefined eligibility criteria using a 2-step process. Quantitative studies were appraised by 2 reviewers using the Risk Of Bias In Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions tool. Qualitative studies were appraised by 2 different reviewers using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist. Extracted data were synthesized narratively. RESULTS We examined 21 studies with low to moderate risk of bias. Of these studies, 13 studies included OSGs hosted on public platforms, 11 studies examined OSGs that were conducted in English, and 6 studies used moderators or peer leaders to facilitate engagement. Studies either reported the number of OSG members (n=1985 across all studies) or the number of posts (range: 223-200,000). The majority of OSG members were females who were not full-time employees and with varied levels of education. There were no randomized controlled trials measuring the efficacy of OSGs. Qualitative and quantitative studies identified empowerment, social support, self-management behavior, and health literacy as primary constructs to measure OSG efficacy. Neutral or marginal improvement was reported in these constructs. Sharing experiences and a greater level of engagement appeared to have an important influence on OSGs efficacy. The extent to which members posted on the website influenced engagement. CONCLUSIONS Across a diverse range of designs, languages, included features, and delivery platforms, peer-to-peer OSGs for chronic musculoskeletal conditions attract predominantly female participants of all ages and education levels. The level of participation of a member appears to be related to their perceived benefit, health literacy, and empowerment. Future studies are needed to identify which design and maintenance strategies have superior efficacy and whether there are concomitant improvements in health outcomes for people with chronic musculoskeletal conditions resulting from participation in OSGs.

Although lungs are considered as the primary infected organs by SARS-CoV-2, some of the other organs including the brain have also been found to be affected. Here, we have discussed how SARS-CoV-2 might infect the brain. The infection of the respiratory center in the brainstem could be hypothesized to be responsible for the respiratory failure in many COVID-19 patients. The virus might gain entry through the olfactory bulb and invade various parts of the brain including the brainstem. Alternatively, entry might also occur from peripheral circulation into the central nervous system (CNS) by compromising the blood-brain barrier. Finally, yet another possible entry route could be its dispersal from the lungs into the vagus nerve, via the pulmonary stretch receptors, eventually reaching the brainstem. Therefore, screening neurological symptoms in COVID-19 patients, especially towards the breakdown of the respiratory center in the brainstem might help us better understand this disease.

METHODS The patient charts and computed tomography scans of consecutive, unilateral, uncomplicated ureteroscopy cases for urolithiasis were retrospectively reviewed. The cases were performed by beginning urology residents over the course of their first 2 years of urology residency training. RESULTS A total of 200 ureteroscopy cases were reviewed. The mean stone diameter was 7.1 (±3.2) mm. Forty-three percent of cases were performed for renal stones and 58 % for ureteral stones. The mean operative time was 80.2 (±36.9) min. The mean fluoroscopy time was 69.1 (±38.2) s. No significant differences existed between cases performed by each of the two residents, and no statistical differences in case difficulty were observed throughout the study period. Linear regression analysis revealed the strongest association with lower fluoroscopy time to be increasing resident experience (p < 0.001). By the end of the 2-year review, fluoroscopy time decreased by 79 % from 135 to 29 s per case. Other significant factors associated with increasing fluoroscopy time were placement of a postoperative stent under fluoroscopic guidance (p < 0.001), utilization of a flexible ureteroscope as opposed to a semirigid ureteroscope (p < 0.001), and balloon dilation of the ureteral orifice (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Fluoroscopy time during uncomplicated, unilateral ureteroscopy for urolithiasis decreases with increasing urology resident operative experience. Other technical options during ureteroscopy were also found to influence fluoroscopy time.","Weld, Lancaster R; Nwoye, Uzoamaka O; Knight, Richard B; Baumgartner, Timothy S; Ebertowski, James S; Stringer, Matthew T; Kasprenski, Matthew C; Weld, Kyle J",World journal of urology,148,25

Few case reports have discussed complications from free intraperitoneal staples after appendectomy. We present the first case of a volvulus caused by a free staple that subsequently required bowel resection. PRESENTATION OF CASE A 27-year-old female underwent laparoscopic appendectomy for uncomplicated appendicitis. The base of the appendix was divided using a laparoscopic gastrointestinal anastomosis (GIA) stapler and the mesoappendix was divided using a LigaSure device. The patient was discharged the following day. Eight days later, the patient returned to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain, emesis, and peritoneal signs. Computed tomography (CT) showed significant pneumoperitoneum and nonspecific small bowel edema. Exploratory laparotomy was performed revealing a necrotic small bowel segment from a malformed, free staple caught on the peritoneum of the small bowel mesentery causing a closed loop obstruction. After reduction and detorsion, the small bowel segment was not viable and required resection. She was discharged on postoperative day four with no additional perioperative complications. DISCUSSION Mechanical staplers are commonly used in laparoscopic appendectomy and free intraperitoneal staples are generally considered inert. A high index of suspicion should be maintained for the early postoperative appendectomy patient with obstructive symptoms. CONCLUSION Inspection of the staple line, choosing the appropriate staple size and cartridge, and removing free malformed staples if seen should be employed during appendectomy to prevent rare but devastating complications.","Kim, Rachel; Moore, Ryan; Schmidt, Lauren; Martin, Katherine; Sjoholm, Lars Ola; Mason, Leonard; Beard, Jessica",International journal of surgery case reports,148,31

We aimed to assess whether high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) levels are associated with major vascular events and whether hs-cTnT may identify patients who benefit from anticoagulation following ESUS. METHODS Data were obtained from the biomarker substudy of the NAVIGATE ESUS trial, a randomized controlled trial testing the efficacy of rivaroxaban versus aspirin for secondary stroke prevention in ESUS. Patients were dichotomized at the hs-cTnT upper reference limit (14 ng/L, Gen V, Roche Diagnostics). Cox proportional hazard models were computed to explore the association between hs-cTnT, the combined cardiovascular end point (recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction, systemic embolism, cardiovascular death), and recurrent ischemic stroke. RESULTS Among 1337 patients enrolled at 111 participating centers in 18 countries (mean age 67±9 years, 61% male), hs-cTnT was detectable in 95% and at/above the upper reference limit in 21%. During a median follow-up of 11 months, the combined cardiovascular end point occurred in 68 patients (5.0%/y, rivaroxaban 28 events, aspirin 40 events; hazard ratio, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.41-1.1]), and recurrent ischemic stroke occurred in 50 patients (4.0%/y, rivaroxaban 16 events, aspirin 34 events, hazard ratio 0.45 [95% CI, 0.25-0.81]). Annualized combined cardiovascular end point rates were 8.2% (9.5% rivaroxaban, 7.0% aspirin) for those above hs-cTnT upper reference limit and 4.8% (3.1% rivaroxaban, 6.6% aspirin) below with a significant treatment modification (P=0.04). Annualized ischemic stroke rates were 4.7% above hs-cTnT upper reference limit and 3.9% below, with no suggestion of an interaction between hs-cTnT and treatment (P=0.3). CONCLUSIONS In patients with ESUS, hs-cTnT was associated with increased cardiovascular event rates. While fewer recurrent strokes occurred in patients receiving rivaroxaban, outcomes were not stratified by hs-cTn results. Our findings support using hs-cTnT for cardiovascular risk stratification but not for decision-making regarding anticoagulation therapy in patients with ESUS.

Recent studies also suggest that several antidepressants may inhibit acid sphingomyelinase activity, which may prevent the infection of epithelial cells with SARS-CoV-2, and that the SSRI fluoxetine may exert in-vitro antiviral effects on SARS-CoV-2. We examined the potential usefulness of antidepressant use in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in an observational multicenter retrospective cohort study conducted at AP-HP Greater Paris University hospitals. Of 7230 adults hospitalized for COVID-19, 345 patients (4.8%) received an antidepressant within 48 h of hospital admission. The primary endpoint was a composite of intubation or death. We compared this endpoint between patients who received antidepressants and those who did not in time-to-event analyses adjusted for patient characteristics, clinical and biological markers of disease severity, and other psychotropic medications. The primary analysis was a multivariable Cox model with inverse probability weighting. This analysis showed a significant association between antidepressant use and reduced risk of intubation or death (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.43-0.73, p < 0.001). This association remained significant in multiple sensitivity analyses. Exploratory analyses suggest that this association was also significant for SSRI and non-SSRI antidepressants, and for fluoxetine, paroxetine, escitalopram, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine (all p < 0.05). These results suggest that antidepressant use could be associated with lower risk of death or intubation in patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Double-blind controlled randomized clinical trials of antidepressant medications for COVID-19 are needed.","Hoertel, Nicolas; Sánchez-Rico, Marina; Vernet, Raphaël; Beeker, Nathanaël; Jannot, Anne-Sophie; Neuraz, Antoine; Salamanca, Elisa; Paris, Nicolas; Daniel, Christel; Gramfort, Alexandre; Lemaitre, Guillaume; Bernaux, Mélodie; Bellamine, Ali; Lemogne, Cédric; Airagnes, Guillaume; Burgun, Anita; Limosin, Frédéric",Molecular psychiatry,148,33

These events are at high risk for psychiatric symptoms in the general population, including anxiety/depression and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS).ObjectivesTo characterize the psychopathological correlates of the spread of COVID-19 and lockdown in a sample of subjects from the Italian population, with a before-after follow-up.MethodsSix weeks after the lockdown, 671 subjects aged 18-60 years completed the Brief Symptom Inventory and Impact of Event Scale-Revised, for the evaluation of psychopathology and PTSS respectively. Environmental factors and subjectively-perceived deteriorations related to COVID-19 were also investigated. Pre-COVID-19 data on psychopathology, collected in December 2019/January 2020, were available for 130 subjects and were used for longitudinal analyses.ResultsWith respect to males, female subjects more frequently reported deteriorations of relations (21.5% vs 10.9%), household arguments (26.0% vs 12.6%), sleep quality (47.6% vs 26.6%), episodes of overeating (22.5% vs 12.5%), worries for oneself (19% vs 8.9%) and for loved ones (55.7% vs 36.5%). These changes were associated with increased psychopathology, PTSS, and numerous environmental conditions, including significant economic damage from COVID-19/lockdown. Longitudinal analyses showed an increase in phobic anxiety in the whole sample, and in depression for female subjects only, following the spread of COVID-19. Pre-existing psychopathology was a significant predictor of PTSS.ConclusionsCOVID-19 epidemic and lockdown have a high impact on psychopathology and PTSS.

Further, during lockdowns, the ability to learn new pleasurable activities (hedonic learning) may be particularly relevant. Here, we investigated if state hedonia and/or hedonic learning mediated the relationship between COVID-19 stress and mental health. Moreover, we explored whether positive appraisal style (PAS), a major resilience factor, influenced these relationships. Methods Using a cross-sectional design, 5000 German-speaking participants filled out online questionnaires targeting stressors, mental health, state hedonia, hedonic learning, and PAS between April 9 and May 15, 2020. After confirming the factor structure of our constructs, we applied latent structural equation modeling to test mediation as well as moderated mediation models. Results Stress showed a positive association with mental health symptoms, which was buffered by both state hedonia and hedonic learning. While higher stress was related to lower state hedonia, participants reported more hedonic learning with greater stressor load. The latter effect was greater for individuals with high PAS. Limitations The present results should be replicated in longitudinal designs with representative samples to confirm the directionality and generalizability of effects. Conclusions Both state hedonia and hedonic learning buffered the effect of stress on mental health in an early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Learning new rewarding activities in combination with a PAS may be especially relevant for maintaining mental health during lockdowns.","Daniels, Anna Wellan Sarah A.; Walter, Henrik",Journal of Affective Disorders Reports,148,20

The novelty of this work is in the development of a new DL algorithm termed as optimized residual network (CO-ResNet) for COVID-19. The proposed CO-ResNet is developed by applying hyperparameter tuning to the conventional ResNet 101. CO-ResNet is applied to a novel dataset of 5,935 X-ray images retrieved from two publicly available datasets. By utilizing resizing, augmentation and normalization and testing different epochs our CO-ResNet was optimized for detecting COVID-19 versus pneumonia with normal healthy lung controls. Different evaluation metrics such as the classification accuracy, F1 score, recall, precision, area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) are used. Our proposed CO-ResNet obtains consistently best performance in the multi-level data classification problem, including health lung, pneumonia affected lung and COVID-19 affected lung samples. In the experimental evaluation, the detection rate accuracy in discerning COVID-19 is 98.74%, and for healthy normal lungs, pneumonia affected lungs are 92.08% and 91.32% respectively for our CO-ResNet with ResNet101 backbone. Further, our model obtained accuracy values of 83.68% and 82% for healthy normal lungs and pneumonia affected lungs with ResNet152 backbone. Experimental results indicate the potential usage of our new DL driven model for classification of COVID-19 and pneumonia.","Bharati, Subrato Podder Prajoy Mondal M. Rubaiyat Hossain Prasath V. B.

From the outset, COVID-19 online learning (CoOL) has differed from conventional online learning due to the limited time that students, instructors, and institutions had to adapt to the online learning platform. Such a rapid transition of learning modes may have affected learning effectiveness, which is yet to be investigated. Thus, identifying the predictive factors of learning effectiveness is crucial for the improvement of CoOL. In this study, we assess the significance of university support, student–student dialogue, instructor–student dialogue, and course design for learning effectiveness, measured by perceived learning outcomes, student initiative, and satisfaction. A total of 409 university students completed our survey. Our findings indicated that student–student dialogue and course design were predictive factors of perceived learning outcomes whereas instructor–student dialogue was a determinant of student initiative. University support had no significant relationship with either perceived learning outcomes or student initiative. In terms of learning effectiveness, both perceived learning outcomes and student initiative determined student satisfaction. The results identified that student–student dialogue, course design, and instructor–student dialogue were the key predictive factors of CoOL learning effectiveness, which may determine the ultimate success of CoOL.","Tsang, Jenny T.

Below average rainfall in spring 2020 coincided with large-scale changes to domestic water consumption patterns, arising from the first UK-wide COVID-19 lockdown, resulting in increased pressure on nationwide resources. A sector wide survey, semi-structured interviews with sector executives, meteorological data, water resource management plans and market information were used to evaluate the impact of acute and chronic threats on water demand in the UK, and how resilience to both can be increased. The COVID-19 pandemic was a particularly acute threat: water demand increased across the country, it was unpredictable and hard to forecast, and compounding this, below average rainfall resulted in some areas having to tanker in water to ‘top up’ the network. This occurred in regions of the UK that are ‘water stressed’ as well as those that are not. We therefore propose a need to look beyond ‘design droughts’ and ‘dry weather average demand’ to characterise the management and resilience of future water resources. As a sector, we can learn from this acute threat and administer a more integrated approach, combining action on the social value of water, the implementation of water trading and the development of nationwide multi-sectoral resilience plans to better respond to short and long-term disruptors.","Bunney, Sarah Lawson Elizabeth Cotterill Sarah Butler David",Sustainability,148,8

The same was asked about leadership training. First, the paper tries to understand doctors’ motivation to lead, specifically, to explore the job characteristics that act as incentives and disincentives. Second, the study points to organisational obstacles that further shrink the medical leadership pipeline.MethodDoctors were surveyed through the Organization of Danish Medical Societies. Our key variables included: (1) the incentives and disincentives for doctors of going into leadership and management and (2) the motivation to participate in leadership training. Our sample of 3534 doctors (17% response) is representative of the population of doctors in Denmark.FindingsThe main reason why doctors are motivated towards leadership is to make a difference. They are put off by fears of extra administration, longer hours, burnout, lack of resources and by organisational cultures resistant to change. However, doctors are aware of their need for leadership development prior to entering management.Practical implicationsTo improve succession planning, health systems should adapt to reflect the incentives of their potential medical leaders. Leadership training is also essential. These changes are especially important now;medical leaders are linked positively to organisational and patient outcomes and have been central in responding to COVID-19, stress and burnout among clinical staff continues to rise, and health systems face recruitment and retention challenges.","Bäker, Agnes Bech Mickael Geerts Jaason Axelsen Susanne Maigaard Ullum Henrik Krabbe Marie P.; Goodall, Amanda H.",BMJ Leader,148,16

But in a pandemic, where the primary responsibility of risk management is not centralised within institutional actors but defused across society, trust can become a double-edged sword. Under these conditions, public trust based on a perception of government competence, care and openness may in fact lead people to underestimate risks and thus reduce their belief in the need to take individual action to control the risks. In this paper, we examine the interaction between trust in government, risk perceptions and public compliance in Singapore in the period between January and April 2020. Using social media tracking and online focus group discussions, we present a preliminary assessment of public responses to government risk communication and risk management measures. We highlight the unique deployment of risk communication in Singapore based on the narrative of ‘defensive pessimism’ to heighten rather than lower levels perceived risk. But the persistence of low public risk perceptions and concomitant low levels of compliance with government risk management measures bring to light the paradox of trust. This calls for further reflection on another dimension of trust which focuses on the role of the public; and further investigation into other social and cultural factors that may have stronger influence over individual belief in the need to take personal actions to control the risks.","Wong, Catherine Mei Ling; Jensen, Olivia",J.

We conducted this study to determine and document the incidence, the associated factors and the outcome (in-hospital mortality) of AKI among COVID-19 patients managed in a center in Nigeria. Methodology: It was a retrospective review of confirmed COVID-19 cases managed at a center in Nigeria. AKI was defined using 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) creatinine criteria. We extracted relevant data from the electronic records of the COVID-19 patients admitted to our hospital and analyzed. Fischer's exact tests were used to test factors associated with AKI for discrete variables, Mann-Whitney U test was used for skewed continuous data, and T-test for continuous normal distribution variables. Results: This study involved 41 of the 56 confirmed COVID-19 cases. The mean age was 45 +/- 17.94 y. A majority of the patients were males (33;80.5%). AKI occurred in 6 (14.6%) of the patients. Of the 6 AKI;4 (66.7%) and 2 (33.3%) were in stages 1 and 3 respectively. One patient (16.7%) had had hemodialysis. Of the 6 with AKI, 3 died with a mortality rate of 50.0%. Factors associated with AKI included age above 45 years, body weakness, severe and critical COVID, urea > 10 mmol/l, and serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dl. Only severe and critical disease was predictive of AKI (adjusted odds ratio 1.777, 95% CI 1.028, 3.074). Conclusion: The results of our study show that AKI is common in severe and critical COVID-19 and is associated with a poor outcome.","Ibrahim, O.

The bounding box output of these methods varies which causes inaccurate distance estimation results. In this study, we propose a distance estimation method for thermal camera applications based on the coordinates of the facial key points extracted using multi-task cascaded convolutional neural network. The result obtained in this study proves that the proposed method exhibits higher accuracy (root mean square error of 2.9695 cm in comparison with an RMSE of 25.26 cm using other methods) and the least CPU and memory consumption in comparison with conventional methods.

Besides, GPA usually involves the upper and lower respiratory tract, and also causes necrotizing glomerulonephritis. The involvement of the heart and gastrointestinal (GI) tract in GPA is unusual, and these are atypical places of this vasculitis. Case Presentation: A 14-year-old girl with a newly diagnosed GPA after afflicting with COVID-19 infection presented with ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction (MI), GI perforation, and intracranial hemorrhage. Conclusions: Although GPA is rare in the pediatric population, it might occur in this age group and could involve multiple organ systems.","Raeeskarami, S. R.; Mousavi, S.

We assessed the role of metabolomic profiling in improving T2D risk prediction beyond conventional risk factors. Methods: NMR-metabolomic profiling was undertaken on baseline plasma samples in 65,684 UK Biobank participants without diabetes and not taking lipid-lowering medication. Cox regression yielded adjusted hazard ratios for the associations of 143 individual metabolic biomarkers (including lipids, lipoproteins, fatty acids, amino acids, ketone bodies and other low molecular weight metabolic biomarkers) and 11 metabolic biomarker principal components (PCs) (accounting for 90% of total variance in individual biomarkers) with incident T2D. These 11 PCs were added to established models for T2D risk prediction, and measures of risk discrimination (c-statistic) and reclassification (continuous net reclassification improvement [NRI], integrated discrimination index [IDI]) were assessed. Findings: During median 11.9 (IQR 11.1-12.6) years' follow-up, 1719 participants developed T2D. After accounting for multiple testing, 118 metabolic biomarkers showed independent associations with T2D risk (false discovery rate controlled p<0.05), of which 103 persisted after additional adjustment for HbA1c. Overall, 10 metabolic biomarker PCs were independently associated with T2D. Addition of PCs to the established risk prediction model (including age, sex, parental history of diabetes, body mass index and HbA1c) improved T2D risk prediction as assessed by the c-statistic (increased from 0.802 [95% CI 0.791-0.812] to 0.830 [0.822-0.841]), continuous NRI (0.44 [0.38-0.49]), and relative (15.0% [10.5%-20.4%]) and absolute (1.5 [1.0-1.9]) IDI. Interpretation: When added to conventional risk factors, circulating NMR-based metabolic biomarkers enhanced T2D risk prediction.","Bragg, F.; Trichia, E.; Aguilar-Ramirez, D.; Besevic, J.; Lewington, S.; Emberson, J.",,148,28

In this study we have employed immunocytochemical techniques to analyze in detail the budding compartment(s) of the virus. Electron microscopy of infected BHK-21 cells showed that virus particles are found in the cisternae throughout the Golgi stack. Within the cisternae, the virus particles were located preferentially in the dilated rims. This would suggest that virus budding may begin at or before the cis Golgi membranes. The virus budding compartment was studied further by immunoelectron microscopy with a pre-Golgi intermediate compartment marker, p58, and a Golgi stack marker protein, mannosidase II (ManII). Virus particles and budding virus were detected in ManII-positive Golgi stack membranes and, interestingly, in both juxtanuclear and peripheral p58-positive elements of the intermediate compartment. In cells incubated at 15 degrees C the nucleocapsid and virus envelope proteins were seen to accumulate in the intermediate compartment. Immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated that at 15 degrees C the nucleocapsid is associated with membranes that show a characteristic distribution and tubulo-vesicular morphology of the pre-Golgi intermediate compartment. These membranes contained virus particles in the lumen. The results indicate that the first site of formation of Uukuniemi virus particles is the pre-Golgi intermediate compartment and that virus budding continues in the Golgi stack. The results raise questions about the intracellular transport pathway of the virus particles, which are 100 to 120 nm in diameter and are therefore too large to be transported in the 60-nm-diameter vesicles postulated to function in the intra-Golgi transport. The distribution of the virus in the Golgi stack may imply that the cisternae themselves have a role in the vectorial transport of virus particles.","Jäntti, J; Hildén, P; Rönkä, H; Mäkiranta, V; Keränen, S; Kuismanen, E",Journal of virology,148,17

Using surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MS) with ProteinChip Array technology, ACE1 and ACE2 activity could be measured using natural peptide substrates. Plasma from C57BL/6 mice, kidney from wild-type and ACE2 knockout mice, and rACE2 were used for assay validation. Plasma or tissue extracts were incubated with angiotensin I (Ang I; 1296 m/z) or angiotensin II (Ang II; 1045 m/z). Reaction mixtures were spotted onto the ProteinChips WCX2 and peptides detected using surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time of flight MS. MS peaks for the substrates, Ang I and Ang II, and the generated peptides, Ang (1-7) and Ang (1-9), were monitored. The ACE2 inhibitor MLN 4760 (0.01 to 100 micromol/L) significantly inhibited rACE2 activity (IC50=3 nmol/L). Ang II was preferably cleaved by rACE2 (km=5 mumol/L), whereas Ang I was not a good substrate for rACE2. There was no detectable ACE2 activity in plasma. Assay specificity was validated in a model of ACE2 gene deletion. In kidney extract from ACE2-deficient mice, there was no generation of Ang (1-7) from Ang II. However, Ang (1-7) was produced when Ang I was used as a substrate. In conclusion, we developed a specific and sensitive assay for ACE2 activity, which used the natural endogenous peptide substrate Ang II. This approach allows for the rapid screening for ACE2, which has applications in drug testing, high-throughput enzymatic assays, and identification of novel substrates/inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system.","Elased, Khalid M; Cunha, Tatiana S; Gurley, Susan B; Coffman, Thomas M; Morris, Mariana",Hypertension,148,1

The causes of both wear and osteolysis are multifactorial; still, improvements in the polyethylene liner have been investigated. Available highly cross-linked polyethylene tibial liners and patellar prostheses differ greatly in the amount and method of irradiation, thermal treatments, and sterilization techniques they undergo. Several varieties of highly cross-linked polyethylene reduce the gravimetric and volumetric wear of tibial liners in knee simulator studies. However, reduced fracture toughness and the generation of smaller and possibly more reactive particles also have been reported with some varieties of polyethylene. Clinical studies of the use of highly cross-linked polyethylene in total knee arthroplasty are limited. Two nonrandomized trials of highly cross-linked polyethylene in total knee arthroplasty have reported a nonsignificant decrease in radiolucent lines at 2 and 5 years, respectively. The risks of using highly cross-linked polyethylene include fracture of the liner or of a posterior-stabilized tibial post, liner dislodgement or locking mechanism disruption, and possibly more osteolysis. Highly cross-linked polyethylene tibial liners may be considered for younger, more active patients. However, until additional clinical results are available, a cautious approach is warranted to the widespread use of highly cross-linked polyethylene in total knee arthroplasty.","Lachiewicz, Paul F; Geyer, Mark R",The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons,148,10

New diagnostic techniques offered more reliable information about the epidemiology of infection by this pathogen. AIM The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and epidemiology of acute M. pneumoniae infections among Greek children hospitalized for RTIs using more advanced techniques. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study included 225 Greek children hospitalized for RTIs during a 15-month period. Throat swab specimens were tested by PCR for the detection of M. pneumoniae, while IgG and IgM antibodies were determined by ELISA and, in certain cases, also by western-blot. In parallel, specimens were tested for the presence of additional respiratory pathogens. RESULTS M. pneumoniae infection was diagnosed as the only pathogen in 25 (11.1%) cases, being the second (after respiratory syncytial virus- RSV) most often detected pathogen. The proportion of cases with M. pneumoniae infection in age group 8-14 years (23.3%) was significantly higher than that in <3 years age group. CONCLUSION During our study period, M. pneumoniae was the second causative agent of RTIs after RSV. The proportion of children with M. pneumoniae RTIs increased with age, while most cases were reported during summer and autumn.","Almasri, M; Diza, E; Papa, A; Eboriadou, M; Souliou, E",Hippokratia,148,5

The 50% effective concentration (EC50) of As2O3 required to inhibit HCV replication was 0.35 microM when it was determined by a reporter-based HCV replication assay, and the EC50 was below 0.2 microM when it was determined by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis.

Design The research team performed a narrative review by searching the Mendeley, Medline, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Springer, and PubMed databases. The search used the keywords COVID-19 infection, epidemiology of respiratory failure pathology in COVID-19 infection, involvement of viral spike protein S of SARSCoV-2, SARS CoV2 transmission, pathophysiology of SARSCoV-2 attack-mediated ARDS, transmission of viral particles of SARSCoV-2 in lungs, mechanism of cytokines in lungs, immunomodulatory response changes in lung physiology, and involvement of nursing officer in nursing patient care management in ICU respiratory failure. Setting This study were conducted at The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, China. Results Nurses are necessarily not only responsible for adequate oxygen management but also for other critical health services to benefit patients, such as control of oxygen saturation and vital signs, to reduce respiratory failure in the ICU. Conclusions The diagnosis of the root cause of respiratory failure and its treatment are complex because a variety of pulmonary and extrapulmonary conditions can cause respiratory failure. Methods of treating acute respiratory failure and other respiratory illness require a multidisciplinary, collaborative approach.

It utilizes our recently developed reverse genetic system based on the RNA polymerase I minigenome system for UUK virus used to study replication, encapsidation, and transcription by monitoring reporter gene expression. Here, we have added the glycoprotein precursor expression plasmid together with the minigenome, nucleoprotein, and polymerase to generate VLPs, which incorporate the minigenome and are released into the supernatant. The particles are able to infect new cells, and reporter gene expression can be monitored if the trans-acting viral proteins (RNA polymerase and nucleoprotein) are also expressed in these cells. No minigenome transfer occurred in the absence of glycoproteins, demonstrating that the glycoproteins are absolutely required for the generation of infectious particles. Moreover, expression of glycoproteins alone was sufficient to produce and release VLPs. We show that the ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) are incorporated into VLPs but are not required for the generation of particles. Morphological analysis of the particles by electron microscopy revealed that VLPs, either with or without minigenomes, display a surface morphology indistinguishable from that of the authentic UUK virus and that they bud into Golgi vesicles in the same way as UUK virus does. This infectious VLP system will be very useful for studying the bunyaviral structural components required for budding and packaging of RNPs and receptor binding and may also be useful for the development of new vaccines for the human pathogens from this family.","Overby, Anna K; Popov, Vsevolod; Neve, Etienne P A; Pettersson, Ralf F",Journal of virology,148,32

Data were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 17 Registry. A total of 763 patients younger than 30 years with carcinoma of a major salivary gland from 1973 to 2004 were identified within the SEER database. The most common salivary gland cancer was mucoepidermoid parotid gland carcinoma. The incidence of all major salivary gland carcinomas increased with increasing patient age. The 5-year relative survival rate for salivary gland carcinomas in our population was calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier analysis in each age group. Relative 5-year survival was 100% in the 1 patient younger than 1 year, 50.0% in the 1- to 4-year-old group; 87.2% among the 5- to 9-year-olds; 97.0% among the 10- to 14-year-olds; 95.0% among the 15- to 19-year-olds; 95.1% among the 20- to 24-year-olds; and 93.6% in the 25- to 29-year-old group. We found that SGC affects patients of all ages, even children in the first year of life. It is essential for physicians to detect salivary gland neoplasms promptly and to evaluate them thoroughly when they are found in children.","Rutt, Amy L; Hawkshaw, Mary J; Lurie, Deborah; Sataloff, Robert T","Ear, nose, & throat journal",148,1

We developed an adoptive-transfer model to more clearly elucidate the role of virus-specific CD8+ T cells during the acute and chronic phases of infection with A59 that is described as follows. C57BL/6 mice were infected with a recombinant A59 virus expressing the gp33 epitope, an H-2Db-restricted CD8+ T-cell epitope encoded in the glycoprotein of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, as a fusion with the enhanced green fluorescent protein (RA59-gfp/gp33). P14 splenocytes (transgenic for a T-cell receptor specific for the gp33 epitope) were transferred at different times pre- and postinfection (p.i.). Adoptive transfer of P14 splenocytes 1 day prior to infection with RA59-gfp/gp33, but not control virus lacking the gp33 epitope, RA59-gfp, reduced weight loss and viral replication and spread in the brain and to the spinal cord. Furthermore, demyelination was significantly reduced compared to that in nonrecipients. However, when P14 cells were transferred on day 3 or 5 p.i., no difference in acute or chronic disease was observed compared to that in nonrecipients. Protection in mice receiving P14 splenocytes prior to infection correlated with a robust gp33-specific immune response that was not observed in mice receiving the later transfers. Thus, an early robust CD8+ T-cell response was necessary to reduce virus replication and spread, specifically to the spinal cord, which protected against demyelination in the chronic phase of the disease.","MacNamara, Katherine C; Chua, Ming Ming; Nelson, Peter T; Shen, Hao; Weiss, Susan R",Journal of virology,148,24

Front-line physicians will face ethical dilemmas during public health emergencies when patients disagree with these measures. Patients might request interventions that are not recommended or for which they are not eligible, or they might object to intrusive or restrictive measures. The physician's primary responsibility in such emergencies is to the public rather than to the individual patient. In public health emergencies, physicians need to address the patient's needs and concerns, recognize their changed roles, and work closely with public health officials. Physicians can still work on behalf of patients by advocating for changes in policies and exceptions when warranted and by mitigating the adverse consequences of public health measures. Before an emergency occurs, physicians should think through how they will respond to foreseeable dilemmas arising when patients disagree with public health recommendations.","Lo, Bernard; Katz, Mitchell H",Annals of internal medicine,148,5

Early in the previous century there was an outbreak of the Spanish Flue and towards the end of the 60's, the AIDS epidemic (HIV). Since the start of the current century, several epidemics broke out and spread to various places around the world, for instance, SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), the Avian Influenza and the Swine Influenza. In 2014 there was an outbreak of Ebola (Ebola virus disease) and in 2015 the Zika virus emerged and there were more. Epidemics cause havoc and impact all areas of life. Each epidemic takes an unfathomable price in lives. It is estimated, for example, that the AIDS epidemic took the lives of some 30 million people. The Corona virus (Covid-19) broke out in China, towards the end of 2019 and spread to most parts of the world. The implications of the outbreak are similar in many countries, among others, due to the uncertainty regarding the way the virus spreads, the appropriate treatment, the lack of vaccination and the high rate of deaths. Naturally, at such times physical protection is a top priority. However, coping with the implications to people's mental health is no less important and these may result in long-term negative impacts.","Shelef, Leah; Zalsman, Gil",Harefuah,148,16

The TRSs are located at the 5' end of TGEV genes and include a highly conserved core sequence (CS), 5'-CUAAAC-3', that is essential for mediating a 100- to 1,000-fold increase in mRNA synthesis when it is located in the appropriate context. The relevant sequences contributing to TRS activity have been studied by extending the CS 5' upstream and 3' downstream. Sequences from virus genes flanking the CS influenced transcription levels from moderate (10- to 20-fold variation) to complete mRNA synthesis silencing, as shown for a canonical CS at nucleotide (nt) 120 from the initiation codon of the S gene that did not lead to the production of the corresponding mRNA. An optimized TRS has been designed comprising 88 nt from the N gene TRS, the CS, and 3 nt 3' to the M gene CS. Further extension of the 5'-flanking nucleotides (i.e., by 176 nt) decreased subgenomic RNA levels. The expression of a reporter gene (beta-glucuronidase) by using the selected TRS led to the production of 2 to 8 microg of protein per 10(6) cells. The presence of an appropriate Kozak context led to a higher level of protein expression. Virus protein levels were shown to be dependent on transcription and translation regulation.","Alonso, Sara; Izeta, Ander; Sola, Isabel; Enjuanes, Luis",Journal of virology,148,16

We use a mathematical model, structured on the location at which infection occurs and based on published parameters for influenza, to describe an epidemic in a community of one million people. The model is then modified to reflect a variety of control strategies based on social distancing measures, targeted antiviral treatment and antiviral prophylaxis and home quarantine, and the effectiveness of the strategies is compared. The results suggest that the only single strategy that would be successful in preventing an epidemic (with R0=2.0) is targeted antiviral treatment and prophylaxis, and that closing schools combined with either closing work places or home quarantine would only prevent such an epidemic if these strategies were combined with a modest level of antiviral coverage.","Roberts, M G; Baker, M; Jennings, L C; Sertsou, G; Wilson, N","Journal of the Royal Society, Interface",148,16

In the present study, a previously undescribed neurovascular disorder associated with a PCV2 infection is described. Sixteen pigs showed clinical signs of wasting and neurologic deficits. Acute hemorrhages and edema of cerebellar meninges and parenchyma due to a necrotizing vasculitis resulted in degeneration and necrosis of the gray and white matter. Few to numerous PCV2 DNA and antigen-bearing endothelial cells were detected in affected areas of the brain using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Conventional histochemical stains, as well as the detection of caspase 3 activity and DNA strand breaks by the terminal transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay, showed numerous apoptotic endothelial cells in the vascular lesions observed. Sequencing of various brain-derived PCV2-specific amplicons revealed a strong identity between different isolates and an 89 to 100% identity to previous isolates. The phylogenetic tree showed that there was no clustering of isolates correlating to clinical signs or geographic distribution. This previously undescribed PCV2-associated neurologic disease has features of both postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome and, to a lesser extent, porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome. The available evidence suggests that direct virus-induced apoptosis of endothelial cells plays a role in the pathogenesis of this unusual PCV2-associated cerebellar vasculitis.","Seeliger, F A; Brügmann, M L; Krüger, L; Greiser-Wilke, I; Verspohl, J; Segalés, J; Baumgärtner, W",Veterinary pathology,148,28

The clinical diseases observed range from an acute encephalomyelitis occurring within 2 weeks postinfection to a subacute demyelinating encephalomyelitis developing several weeks or months postinfection. Uncloned wild-type virus induced both acute and subacute diseases, whereas cloned JHM virus grown in tissue culture caused only acute disease without the pronounced lesions of primary demyelination. In contrast, temperature-sensitive mutants selected from that clone were capable of inducing subacute demyelinating encephalomyelitis after prolonged incubation times. Viruses recovered from diseased animals were still temperature sensitive. Inoculation of temperature-sensitive mutants into suckling rats (age, 10 to 15 days) produced high rates of subacute demyelinating diseases running a more chronic course; these diseases often were not fatal. Those rats which did not show clinical signs frequently revealed inflammatory demyelinating lesions. These findings indicate that the rate and type of clinical disease are dependent on the neurovirulence of the virus mutant used for inoculation and the age of the animals at the time of infection.","Wege, H; Koga, M; Watanabe, R; Nagashima, K; ter Meulen, V",Infection and immunity,148,20

Hence, health care workers, who are in close contact with affected patients, face many risks. There need to be a greater understanding of: individual HCWs' risk perceptions; adopted risk-mitigating strategies; and factors influencing both. OBJECTIVES This review aimed to establish the best evidence regarding health care worker's risk perceptions and workplace strategies towards emerging acute respiratory infectious diseases in acute hospital and community healthcare settings; and to make recommendations for practice and future research. INCLUSION CRITERIA Participants Studies that included male and female health care workers practising in acute and community health care settings were considered.Types of intervention (s)/Phenomena of interest This review considered studies that investigated: health care workers' risk perceptions; perceived meaning/effectiveness of the individual and workplace strategies implemented; and the factors influencing both.Types of outcomes This review focused on factors affecting: health care worker' risk perceptions; use of risk-mitigating strategies; and their perceived meaning and effectiveness.Types of studies Both qualitative and quantitative study designs published in the English language were including in the study. SEARCH STRATEGY Using a three-step search strategy, the following databases from 1997-2009 were accessed: CINAHL, PubMed, SCOPUS, ScienceDirect, Sociological Abstracts, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY Two independent reviewers assessed each paper for methodological validity prior to inclusion in the review using standardised critical appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute. Disagreements were resolved through discussion, or with a third reviewer. DATA EXTRACTION Information was extracted by two independent reviewers from each paper using the standardised data extraction tools from JBI. DATA SYNTHESIS The findings are presented in narrative form, as textual pooling and statistical pooling was not possible for the qualitative and quantitative papers respectively. RESULTS Ten quantitative studies and one qualitative study were included in the review. Findings indicated that although health care workers perceived personal and familial health risks and stigmatization from their exposure to emerging acute respiratory infectious diseases, the majority were accepting of these risks. Organizational implementation of infection control measures; avoidance of patients; and complying with personal protective equipment were identified as risk-mitigating strategies. Demographic, individual and organizational factors were found to influence their risk perceptions and their adoption of these strategies. CONCLUSIONS There is a nebulous relationship between health care workers' risk perceptions and how these perceptions affect their use of risk-mitigating strategies. Hence, future research needs to examine the nuances of this relationship, as well as the influencing factors involved. In this review, several key factors influencing health care workers' risk perceptions and risk-mitigating strategies were identified and these may form the implications for new practice. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Institutions need to: empower health care workers through education and training; protect them with organizational safeguards; and offer incentives to encourage willingness to work, especially for those with high risk perceptions. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH Future research need to examine the: differences between HCWs' intentions to care during SARS and influenza outbreaks; relationship between intentions to care and actual care provided; difference between their intentions to care/resign and acceptance of risks; factors influencing their intentions to care; and factors influencing compliance to infection control measures.","Yiwen, Koh; Hegney, Desley; Drury, Vicki",JBI library of systematic reviews,148,16

METHODS A retrospective, descriptive study of prospectively collected data from the Midland Trauma Registry in New Zealand. RESULTS There was a 36.7% (p<.00001) reduction in injury admissions during Alert Level 4 ('Lockdown') compared with the same period in 2017, 2018 and 2019. This was in the context of volume increases during the pre-lockdown period (17.8%, p<.00001) and a 'rebound' as restrictions eased. There was an increase in injuries occurring at home (28.3%, p<.00001) and on footpaths (37.9%, p=0.00076), while there was a decline in events on roads (33.0%, p=0.017), at schools (75.0%, p<.00001) and in sports areas (79.7%, p<.00001). Falls remained the dominant mechanism of injury in 2020, contributing 39.9% of all hospitalisations. CONCLUSIONS The reduction in hospital admissions during alert levels 4 and 3 was short lived, with a rebound evident when restrictions eased. Hospital resources have been strained because this rebound coincided with a planned 'catch up' on healthcare that was delayed during the higher community restriction levels.","Christey, Grant; Amey, Janet; Singh, Neerja; Denize, Bronwyn; Campbell, Alaina",The New Zealand medical journal,148,32

Given the difficulties of identifying hMPV by conventional culture, molecular techniques could improve the detection of this virus in clinical specimens. In this study, we developed a real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assay designed to detect the four genetic lineages of hMPV. This assay and a commercial real-time nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) assay (bioMérieux, Durham, NC) were used to determine the prevalence of hMPV in 114 immunosuppressed asymptomatic and symptomatic lung transplant recipients and 232 pediatric patients who were being evaluated for pertussis. hMPV was detected in 4.3% of the immunosuppressed lung transplant recipients and in 9.9% of children evaluated for pertussis. Both RT-PCR and NASBA assays were efficient in detection of hMPV infection in respiratory specimens. Even though hMPV was detected in a small number of the lung transplant recipients, it was still the most prevalent etiologic agent detected in patients with respiratory symptoms. In both of these diverse patient populations, hMPV infection was the most frequent viral respiratory tract infection identified.

Burnout and wellbeing were assessed using the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI) and a variety of quantitative measures. Differences between measures were assessed by demography and work role using univariate analyses. Multivariate analyses assessed associations between burnout and wellbeing. RESULTS 1,372 staff responded from 22 EDs around New Zealand (response rate 43%). Most were female (n=678, 63%), NZ European (n=799, 59%), aged 20-39 years (n=743, 54%) and nurses (n=711, 52%). The overall prevalence of personal burnout was 60%, work-related burnout 55% and patient-related burnout 19%. There was a wide variation of burnout across all EDs. Females and nurses showed the highest degree of burnout by gender and role, respectively. Measures of wellbeing with significant negative correlations with burnout were work-related happiness, work-life balance, job satisfaction and perceived workplace excellence. Work stress had significant positive correlation with burnout. CONCLUSION New Zealand ED staff have a high degree of burnout.

Initial laboratory studies were significant for hyponatremia, elevated liver function tests including direct hyperbilirubinemia, and leukocytosis with neutrophilia. Imaging revealed mild gallbladder wall edema, a small area of colitis, and small pleural effusion. She was treated for Kawasaki Disease Shock Syndrome (KDSS) with pulse dose solumedrol, IVIG, and aspirin with near resolution of symptoms and normalization of vital signs within 1 day and subsequent improvement in her laboratory abnormalities. She was later found to be COVID-19 IgG positive, suggesting past exposure. This case represents an early report of a KD-like illness in an adult with serologic evidence of a previous COVID-19 infection, similar to MIS-C.

Likewise, level of SOC might affect mental health among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic differently. In this study, we investigated the relationships between lifestyle changes and mental health (General Health Questionnaire-12: GHQ-12) among different level of SOC (weak, moderate, or strong by SOC-13). The data of 898 healthcare workers from cross-sectional survey dataset were extracted and analyzed. As results, based on GHQ-12 score, 86.1% of 244 participants with weak SOC, 60.1% of 606 participants with moderate SOC, and 31.3% of 48 participants with strong SOC had poor mental health. Both SOC levels and lifestyle changes (except alcohol consumption) had significant main effects on the GHQ-12 score. Analysis on the association between lifestyle changes and mental health status stratified by SOC level reveled that among participants with weak SOC, those who increased their leisure and activity time had reduced odds of poor mental health than those who made no changes (OR: 0.08, CI: 0.01 to 0.64). Healthcare workers with weak SOC were at risk of poor mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, and lifestyle changes may improve their mental health.","Tanaka, Kento; Tahara, Masatoshi; Mashizume, Yuki; Takahashi, Kayoko",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),148,21

In the literature, multiple reports of microscopic pulmonary findings of vascular structures in patients deceased by or with SARS-Cov-2 infection are available. Nevertheless, the scientific literature lacks a systematic analysis of these findings. Methods: the authors realized a systematic review of the literature in order to identify common microscopic patterns representative of pulmonary vascular damage: useful data for pathologists in clinical and forensic settings. The research yielded 23 articles (79 total cases). Quali/quantitative analysis was carried out. Conclusion: the review allowed to identify vascular thrombosis (especially in lesser caliber vessels) as common microscopic pattern. The recurrence of this pattern was confirmed by scientific literature data which demonstrate SARS-CoV-2 ability to interfere with coagulation cascade. Other meaningful microscopic findings were also discussed, even if their low frequency in study population did not allow to define them as common.","Lupariello, F.; Vairano, F.; Mattioda, G.; Mirri, F.; Gabriele, A.; Di Vella, G.",Medico-Legal Update,148,16

This study analyzes the spatiotemporal pattern of the COVID-19 pandemic in China, reveals China's epicenters of the pandemic through spatial clustering, and delineates the substantial effect of distance to Wuhan on the pandemic spread. The results show that the daily new COVID-19 cases mostly occurred in and around Wuhan before March 6, and then moved to the Grand Bay Area (Shenzhen, Hong Kong and Macau). The total COVID-19 cases in China were mainly distributed in the east of the Huhuanyong Line, where the epicenters accounted for more than 60% of the country's total in/on 24 January and 7 February, half in/on 31 January, and more than 70% from 14 February. The total cases finally stabilized at approximately 84,000, and the inflection point for Wuhan was on 14 February, one week later than those of Hubei (outside Wuhan) and China (outside Hubei). The generalized additive model-based analysis shows that population density and distance to provincial cities were significantly associated with the total number of the cases, while distances to prefecture cities and intercity traffic stations, and population inflow from Wuhan after 24 January, had no strong relationships with the total number of cases. The results and findings should provide valuable insights for understanding the changes in the COVID-19 transmission as well as implications for controlling the global COVID-19 pandemic spread.","Feng, Yongjiu; Li, Qingmei; Tong, Xiaohua; Wang, Rong; Zhai, Shuting; Gao, Chen; Lei, Zhenkun; Chen, Shurui; Zhou, Yilun; Wang, Jiafeng; Yan, Xiongfeng; Xie, Huan; Chen, Peng; Liu, Shijie; Xv, Xiong; Liu, Sicong; Jin, Yanmin; Wang, Chao; Hong, Zhonghua; Luan, Kuifeng; Wei, Chao; Xu, Jinfu; Jiang, Hua; Xiao, Changjiang; Guo, Yiyou",PLoS One,148,22

Therefore, each individual has a duty to support the efforts of their countries either financially, socially, technically, or by any other means to contribute to the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. During this crisis, engineers can come up with innovations to fight the pandemic. One of the reasons for the death of a patient suffering from COVID-19 was the lack of resources required for patient care. The doctors who are taking care of COVID patients could get infected due to lack or the deficiency of available safety kits. Some of the resources required to fight COVID-19 are personal protective equipment (PPE) (e.g. gloves, gowns, face masks and shields for respiratory and eye protection respectively), mechanical ventilators and body vital monitoring devices. Engineers can contribute to the fight against COVID-19, by developing compact size ventilators, 3D printed face shield, masks, door handles, hand sanitizer, etc. The available medicines to fight the disease are still under development and trials with limited options at present has led to deaths among patients mostly those who are elderly or having any co-morbid condition.

In the present work, we have elucidated the mechanism of binding of two inhibitors, namely &#945;-ketoamide and Z31792168, to SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro or 3CLpro) by using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations. We calculated the total binding free energy (&#916;Gbind) of both inhibitors and further decomposed &#916;Gbind into various forces governing the complex formation using the Molecular Mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM/PBSA) method. Our calculations reveal that &#945;-ketoamide is more potent (&#916;Gbind= - 9.05 kcal/mol) compared to Z31792168 (&#916;Gbind= - 3.25 kcal/mol) against COVID-19 3CLpro. The increase in &#916;Gbind for &#945;-ketoamide relative to Z31792168 arises due to an increase in the favorable electrostatic and van der Waals interactions between the inhibitor and 3CLpro. Further, we have identified important residues controlling the 3CLpro-ligand binding from per-residue based decomposition of the binding free energy. Finally, we have compared &#916;Gbind of these two inhibitors with the anti-HIV retroviral drugs, such as lopinavir and darunavir. It is observed that &#945;-ketoamide is more potent compared to lopinavir and darunavir. In the case of lopinavir, a decrease in van der Waals interactions is responsible for the lower binding affinity compared to &#945;-ketoamide. On the other hand, in the case of darunavir, a decrease in the favorable intermolecular electrostatic and van der Waals interactions contributes to lower affinity compared to &#945;-ketoamide. Our study might help in designing rational anti-coronaviral drugs targeting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

We use comparative genomics to provide a high-confidence protein-coding gene set, characterize evolutionary constraint, and prioritize functional mutations. We select 44 Sarbecovirus genomes at ideally-suited evolutionary distances, and quantify protein-coding evolutionary signatures and overlapping constraint. We find strong protein-coding signatures for ORFs 3a, 6, 7a, 7b, 8, 9b, and a novel alternate-frame gene, ORF3c, whereas ORFs 2b, 3d/3d-2, 3b, 9c, and 10 lack protein-coding signatures or convincing experimental evidence of protein-coding function. Furthermore, we show no other conserved protein-coding genes remain to be discovered. Mutation analysis suggests ORF8 contributes to within-individual fitness but not person-to-person transmission. Cross-strain and within-strain evolutionary pressures agree, except for fewer-than-expected within-strain mutations in nsp3 and S1, and more-than-expected in nucleocapsid, which shows a cluster of mutations in a predicted B-cell epitope, suggesting immune-avoidance selection. Evolutionary histories of residues disrupted by spike-protein substitutions D614G, N501Y, E484K, and K417N/T provide clues about their biology, and we catalog likely-functional co-inherited mutations.

But there exist cases in the real practical world that assumption of symmetric distribution of the error terms is not satisfactory. In our methodology, the distribution of the error has been considered to be two-piece scale mixtures of normal (TP–SMN). The proposed time series models works well than ordinary Gaussian and symmetry models (especially for COVID-19 datasets), and were fitted initially to the historical COVID-19 datasets. Then, the time series that has the best fit to each of the dataset is selected.

However, blood group antigens appear not to be conventional susceptibility factors in that they do not affect disease severity, and the relative risk to non-O individuals is attenuated when population prevalence is high. Here, I model a scenario in which ABO transfusion incompatibility reduces the chance of a patient transmitting the virus to an incompatible recipient - thus in Western populations type A and AB individuals are ""super-recipients"" while type O individuals are ""super-spreaders"". This results in an offset in the timing of the epidemic among individuals of different blood types, and an increased relative risk to type A/AB patients that is most pronounced during early stages of the epidemic. However, once the majority of any given population is infected, the relative risk to each blood type approaches unity. Published data on COVID-19 prevalence from regions in the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic suggests that if this model holds true, ABO incompatibility reduces virus transmissibility by at least 60 %. Exploring the implications of this model for vaccination strategies shows that paradoxically, targeted vaccination of either high-susceptibility type A/AB or ""super-spreader"" type O individuals is less effective than random vaccination at blocking community spread of the virus. Instead, the key is to maintain blood type diversity among the remaining susceptible individuals. Given the good agreement between this model and observational data on disease prevalence, the underlying biochemistry urgently requires experimental investigation.","Ellis, Peter J I",Epidemics,148,20

Acute aortic conditions have also been described, followed by interesting observations on cases, hypothesis, raised since the emergence of the pandemics. METHODS: a review of cases in literature of aortic pathology in patients with clinically suspected/microbiologically confirmed COVID-19 infection has been carried out to analyze anagraphic data, clinical presentation, treatment options and outcome. RESULTS: Seventeen cases have been included. Mean age of patients was 58.6 ± 15.2 years, with a male to female ratio of 12:15 (70.5% vs. 29.5%). Comorbidities were reported in 11 cases (64.7%), but in 5 cases (29.4%) no previous pathology was signaled in history. Hypertension was the most frequently reported comorbidity, in 8 cases, (47%), followed by renal pathology (17.6%), coronary artery disease (17.6%), previous aortic surgery (11.7%) and arrhythmia (11.7%); but also cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, autoimmune conditions, previous neoplasia and arrhythmia were reported once each. Fever and thoracic pain were the most frequently reported findings at presentation (8 cases, 47% each), followed by respiratory symptoms (6, 35.2%), low lymphocyte count (17.6%), features related to aneurysm rupture, ischemic stroke, abdominal pain and acute renal insufficiency. Reported aortic pathology included: type A aortic dissection (11 cases; 64.7%); new pathology of previous aortic graft (2 cases, 11.7%); 2 aortitis, 1 associated with type A aortic dissection; 1 thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysm, 1 ruptured aortic aneurysm and 1 aortic embolizing thrombosis. Open surgery was carried out in 10 cases (58.8%), endovascular treatment in 3 (17.6%). Three patients (17.6%) died before surgery. Exitus was reported in 4 cases, with a total mortality of 23.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Acute aortic events have occurred during pandemic in patients with clinically suspected/microbiologically confirmed COVID-19 infection. Confounding clinical features at presentation, the importance of anamnestic details (as previous vascular graft implant), the observed surgical and postoperatory challenges may suggest the need to consider the implications of the possible link between acute aortic events and SARS-CoV-2 infection, in order to promptly correctly diagnose the patient and respond to specific needs.","Silvestri, Valeria; Recchia, Gregorio Egidio",Ann. vasc. surg,148,24

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS: Patients previously implanted with a telemetric IOP sensor (Eyemate; Implandata GmbH) were included. METHODS: Intraocular pressure measurements acquired by the patients during the lockdown were collected by physicians who were located remotely. A questionnaire was sent to 10 participating study centers to evaluate the clinical impact of remote monitoring of IOP via the IOP sensor system. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of patients who obtained home IOP measurements. RESULTS: Data were available from all centers and from 37 eyes of 37 patients (16 patients with a sulcus-based sensor and 21 patients with a suprachoroidal sensor). Thirty-four patients obtained IOP measurements during the lockdown. Mean age of the patients was 69.3 ± 9.6 years, and 48.6% were women. A total of 8415 IOP measurements from 370 measurement days were obtained. Based on remote IOP measurements, treatment was changed in 5 patients. In another 5 patients, treatment change was considered when physicians received the IOP measurements after the lockdown. Nine of the 10 study centers judged remote IOP measurements to have a clinical impact.

It plays important physiological roles in various organisms and has strong antioxidant properties. The biosynthetic pathway of PQQ involves a gene cluster composed of 4 to 7 genes, named pqqA-G, among which pqqA is a key gene for PQQ synthesis, encoding the precursor peptide PqqA. To produce recombinant PqqA in E. coli, fusion tags were used to increase the stability and solubility of the peptide, as well simplify the scale-up of the fermentation process. In this paper, pqqA from Gluconobacter oxydans 621H was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) as a fusion protein with SUMO and purified using a hexahistidine (His6) tag.

Apparently in 2019 during the month of December in Wuhan, china a new strand of coronavirus which was formerly named as ""2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)"" and now is addressed as SARS-CoV2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus -2). The disease caused by SARS-CoV2 called Covid-19;it is a new public disaster, transmitted from one human to another through various body fluids predominantly through contaminated droplets. Covid-19 is forbearing in most people;it can advance to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multi-organ dysfunction in some (usually the elders and those with comorbidities). COVID-19 was called a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020. One concern would be how capable the health care systems of the world are to respond to an epidemic of this magnitude. In different regions, rapid identification, and control of the virus at the entry points is crucial throughout in order to prevent widespread population transmission. Based on current published evidence, a summary of various curbing measures with prevention and tenacity of SARS-Cov2 is provided in this review article. Through this review we also provide information about the clinical trials for vaccines and treatment filed by different pharma companies which is one of the most awaited and dominant research in current scenarios around the globe.","Saira, Khan Rishabh Baliyan Anusha R.

Despite growing evidence on the suitability of antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDT) for mass screening at the event entry, this strategy has not been assessed under controlled conditions. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of a prevention strategy during a live indoor concert. METHODS: We designed a randomised controlled open-label trial to assess the effectiveness of a comprehensive preventive intervention for a mass-gathering indoor event (a live concert) based on systematic same-day screening of attendees with Ag-RDTs, use of facial masks, and adequate air ventilation. The event took place in the Sala Apolo, Barcelona, Spain. Adults aged 18-59 years with a negative result in an Ag-RDT from a nasopharyngeal swab collected immediately before entering the event were randomised 1:1 (block randomisation stratified by age and gender) to either attend the indoor event for 5 hours or go home. Nasopharyngeal specimens used for Ag-RDT screening were analysed by real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and cell culture (Vero E6 cells). 8 days after the event, a nasopharyngeal swab was collected and analysed by Ag-RDT, RT-PCR, and a transcription-mediated amplification test (TMA). The primary outcome was the difference in incidence of RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at 8 days between the control and the intervention groups, assessed in all participants who were randomly assigned, attended the event, and had a valid result for the SARS-CoV-2 test done at follow-up. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04668625. FINDINGS: Participant enrollment took place during the morning of the day of the concert, Dec 12, 2020. Of the 1140 people who responded to the call and were deemed eligible, 1047 were randomly assigned to either enter the music event (experimental group) or continue with normal life (control group). Of the 523 randomly assigned to the experimental group, 465 were included in the analysis of the primary outcome (51 did not enter the event and eight did not take part in the follow-up assessment), and of the 524 randomly assigned to the control group, 495 were included in the final analysis (29 did not take part in the follow-up). At baseline, 15 (3%) of 495 individuals in the control group and 13 (3%) of 465 in the experimental group tested positive on TMA despite a negative Ag-RDT result. The RT-PCR test was positive in one case in each group and cell viral culture was negative in all cases. 8 days after the event, two (<1%) individuals in the control arm had a positive Ag-RDT and PCR result, whereas no Ag-RDT nor RT-PCR positive results were found in the intervention arm. The Bayesian estimate for the incidence between the experimental and control groups was -0·15% (95% CI -0·72 to 0·44). INTERPRETATION: Our study provides preliminary evidence on the safety of indoor mass-gathering events during a COVID-19 outbreak under a comprehensive preventive intervention. The data could help restart cultural activities halted during COVID-19, which might have important sociocultural and economic implications.

Concerns about their safety and their role in China's efforts to minimize the spread of the disease have raised concerns about their global acceptance. The WHO revised their recommendation in June 2020. They now limit the use of face coverings to individuals who are healthy and caring for a person with suspected respiratory illness. Face coverings were worn by about 97% of the people observed in Cambodia and 83% in Peru. In India, about half of the people surveyed wore them. The prevalence of the use of face coverings among the population during the pandemic COVID-19 was revealed to be significantly different across various risk communication channels. During the SARS crisis in Asia, the public's acceptance of face coverings was quickly established. In North America, the use of face coverings has been delayed due to the media's coverage of the issue. The population of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is exposed to various diseases outbreaks, but none of these have required the use of facial coverings. This study aims to develop effective social marketing strategies that will involve the use of free face coverings. Face mask use prevalence has been assessed using photo-epidemiological methods in crowds. These methods are typically not representative of the general public's population and are not suitable for assessing COVID-19 transmission. However, they can help inform public health advisories and other interventions.","Elachola, H.; Gozzer, E.; Rahman, N. M. M.; Ditekemena, J.; Pando-Robles, V.; Pa, K.; Ebrahim, S.

METHODS: A multi-disciplinary team developed a screening score taking into account epidemiology history, clinical feature, radiographic feature, and routine blood test. At fever clinics, the screening score was used to identify the patients with moderate to high probability of COVID-19 among all the suspected patients. The patients with moderate to high probability of COVID-19 were allocated to a single room in an isolation ward with level-3 protection. And those with low probability were allocated to a single room in a general ward with level-2 protection. At the isolation ward, the screening score was used to identify the confirmed and probable cases after two consecutive real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests. The data in the People's Hospital of Changshou District were used for internal validation and those in the People's Hospital of Yubei District for external validation. RESULTS: We enrolled 76 and 40 patients for internal and external validation, respectively. In the internal validation cohort, the area under the curve of receiver operating characteristics (AUC) was 0.96 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.89-0.99] for the diagnosis of moderate to high probability of cases among all the suspected patients. Using 60 as cut-off value, the sensitivity and specificity were 88% and 93%, respectively. In the isolation ward, the AUC was 0.94 (95% CI: 0.83-0.99) for the diagnosis of confirmed and probable cases. Using 90 as cut-off value, the sensitivity and specificity were 78% and 100%, respectively. These results were confirmed in the validation cohort.

This has focused attention on developing gender-sensitive and strengths-based approaches to engage so-called 'hard-to-reach' men. Men's Sheds ('Sheds') are recognized as an alternative space in which to engage older and more marginalized groups of men in health. The aim of this study was to establish key principles that could align the ethos of Sheds with a national health promotion initiative ('Sheds for Life'; SFL) in terms of methods of engagement, programme content and models of delivery. Qualitative methods incorporating semi-structured interviews, focus groups and observations were conducted with men in Sheds ('Shedders'; n = 38), oversight/advisory groups (n = 11) and partner organizations (n = 8). The principles of grounded theory were used to inform data collection and analysis. Findings revealed a range of mediating factors in terms of how Shedders engage with or 'do' health that were grounded in a recognition of the health-enhancing 'essence' of Sheds and in 'making men's health men's business'. Key learnings arising from the process of engaging with Shedders included the importance of investing in relationships, establishing credibility and tailoring SFL programme content and delivery to individual Sheds. In terms of conceptualizing SFL, attention was drawn to the need for a coherent and formalized SFL strategy and 'rules of engagement', as well as a robust and sustainable system for implementation. This is the first study that informs a more systematic and formal approach to health promotion in Sheds.","Bergin, Niamh; Richardson, Noel",Health promot. internation,148,16

DISCUSSION: This new strain of coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, enters human cells that express angiotensin-converting enzyme II receptors, which exist in the respiratory, gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts and heart, causing coronavirus disease. Transmission occurs essentially through the respiratory tract and the main symptoms are fever, cough and dyspnea. Diagnosis is based on epidemiological, clinical and imaging features and confirmed by nucleic acid testing.

Currently, remdesivir is being investigated in ten randomized controlled trials against COVID-19. The dose regimen of remdesivir is an IV loading dose of 200 mg on day 1 followed by daily IV maintenance doses of 100 mg for 5-9 days. Based on our data analysis, however, remdesivir with IV administration alone is unlikely to achieve excellent clinical efficacy. This analysis is based on the following observations: plasma exposures of remdesivir and its active metabolite are unlikely to be correlated with its clinical efficacy; remdesivir and its active metabolites are unlikely to be adequate in the lung to kill the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Even if remdesivir demonstrates benefits in the current randomized controlled trials, its efficacy may be limited. We suggest that a combination of an IV and pulmonary delivery dose regimen should be studied immediately to realize a potentially more effective antiviral therapy against COVID-19.

The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 harbors a furin cleavage site insertion in contrast to SARS-CoV, which may be related to its stronger communicability. An avian coronavirus with an extra furin cleavage site upstream of the fusion peptide (S2' site) infected monocyte cells and neuron cells leading to viremia or encephalitis, respectively. Immunohistochemistry and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction were used to follow disease progression and demonstrated differences between the parent avian coronavirus and mutated avian coronavirus with a furin-S2' site. Magnetic resonance imaging and biological dye to evaluate the blood-brain barrier permeability showed that avian coronavirus with a furin-S2' site had increased permeability compared with parent avian coronavirus. Immunohistochemistry of brains after intracerebral injection of avian coronavirus and immunofluorescence staining of primary neuron cells demonstrated the furin-S2' site expanded the cell tropism of the mutant avian coronavirus to neuron cells. TNF-&#945;, which has a key role in blood-brain barrier permeability, was highly induced by avian coronavirus with a furin-S2' site compared with the parent avian coronavirus. We demonstrated the process involved in mutant avian coronavirus-induced disease and that the addition of a furin-S2' site changed the virus cell tropism.IMPORTANCECoronaviruses have broken out three times in two decades. Spike (S) protein plays a key role in the process of infection. To clarify importance of furin cleavage site in spike protein for coronavirus, we investigated the pathogenesis of neurotropic avian coronavirus whose spike protein contains an extra furin cleavage site (furin-S2' site). By combining real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry we demonstrated that infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) infects brain instead of trachea when its S protein contains furin-S2' site. Moreover, the virus was shown to increase the permeability of blood-brain barrier, infect neuron cells and induce high expression of TNF-&#945;. Based on these results we further show that furin cleavage site in S protein plays an important role in coronavirus pathogenicity and cell tropism. Our study extends previous publications on function of S protein of coronavirus, increasing the understanding of researchers to coronavirus.","Cheng, Jinlong; Zhao, Ye; Hu, Yanxin; Zhao, Jing; Xue, Jia; Zhang, Guozhong",J. virol,148,1

Here, a strategy for effectively dispersing graphene using graphene oxide (GO) to produce homogeneous, tunable, and ultrahigh concentration graphene dispersions (>150 mg mL-1 ) is proposed. The structure of GO with abundant edge-bound hydrophilic carboxyl groups and in-plane hydrophobic &#960;-conjugated domains allows it to function as a special ""surfactant"" that enables graphene dispersion. In acidic solutions, GO sheets tend to form edge-to-edge hydrogen bonds and expose the &#960;-conjugated regions which interact with graphene, thereby promoting graphene dispersion. While in alkaline solutions, GO sheets tend to stack in a surface-to-surface manner, thereby blocking the &#960;-conjugated regions and impeding graphene dispersion. As the concentration of GO-dispersed graphene dispersion (GO/G) increases, a continuous transition between four states is obtained, including a dilute dispersion, a thick paste, a free-standing gel, and a kneadable, playdough-like material. Furthermore, GO/G can be applied to create desirable structures including highly conductive graphene films with excellent flexibility, thereby demonstrating an immense potential in flexible composite materials.","Luo, Jiajun; Yang, Liangwei; Sun, Danping; Gao, Zhenfei; Jiao, Kun; Zhang, Jin",Small,148,23

This paper proposes a conceptualization of Interactive Feedback (IF) for Mathematics, which is a step-by-step interactive process that guides the learner in the resolution of a task after one or more autonomous tentative. This conceptualization is grounded on theories and models of automatic assessment, formative assessment, and feedback. We discuss the effectiveness of the IF for engaging students from low socio-economic contexts in closing the gap between current and reference performance through a didactic experimentation involving 299 Italian students in grade 8. Using quantitative analyses on data from the automatic assessment, we compared the results of the first and last attempts in activities with and without IF, based on algorithmic parameters so that the task changes at every attempt. We found that IF was more effective than other kinds of activities to engage learners in actions aimed at improving their results, and the effects are stronger in low socio-economic contexts. © 2021 by the authors.

Objectives: To assess immediate and long-term effects of the pandemic on dermatology practice on a large scale, including the clinical activity of participant, frequency and types of procedures used, and teledermatology (TD) use. Methods: This web-based, global survey included 733 dermatologists. Primary outcomes are percentages of responders providing in-person consultations, hospital service, and TD, and doing procedures. Also, factors in logistic regression models that may influence the Odds Ratio (OR) for TD use during pandemic and for future use. Results: The percentages of responders providing in-person consultations (46.6% vs 100% before), and hospital service (27% vs 52.8% before), and doing procedures (25.6% vs 100% before) decreased while practicing TD increased three-fold (75.2% vs 26.1% before) during pandemic (P < .001 for each). Practice location was associated with TD use during the pandemic and with its expected use in the future (P < .001 for both), with North American responders indicating the highest use. TD use during the pandemic showed a positive correlation with TD use before, performing procedures and, more specifically, with biopsies of suspicious pigmented lesions during pandemic (P < .001 for each). TD use before pandemic was the most powerful predictor of TD use during pandemic (OR, 16.47 [95% CI, 7.12-38.06]). More than two thirds (68.6%) of participants expect to use TD in the future. The factor with the largest increase in OR on the expectation of future TD use was >1,000 COVID-19 cases in the country (OR, 3.80 [95% CI, 2.33-6.21]). Conclusions: This survey indicates a profound immediate effect of the pandemic on dermatology practice.

However, universal language models may perform weakly in these fake news detection for lack of large-scale annotated data and sufficient semantic understanding of domain-specific knowledge. While the model trained on corresponding corpora is also mediocre for insufficient learning. In this paper, we propose a novel transformer-based language model fine-tuning approach for these fake news detection. First, the token vocabulary of individual model is expanded for the actual semantics of professional phrases. Second, we adapt the heated-up softmax loss to distinguish the hard-mining samples, which are common for fake news because of the disambiguation of short text. Then, we involve adversarial training to improve the model's robustness. Last, the predicted features extracted by universal language model RoBERTa and domain-specific model CT-BERT are fused by one multiple layer perception to integrate fine-grained and high-level specific representations. Quantitative experimental results evaluated on existing COVID-19 fake news dataset show its superior performances compared to the state-of-the-art methods among various evaluation metrics.

SARS-CoV-2 is a large RNA virus and testing of all of its overlapping peptides in vitro to deconvolute an immune response is not feasible. Therefore HLA-binding prediction tools are often used to narrow down the number of peptides to test. We tested NetMHC suite tools' predictions by using an in vitro peptide-MHC stability assay. We assessed 777 peptides that were predicted to be good binders across 11 MHC alleles in a complex-stability assay and tested a selection of 19 epitope-HLA-binding prediction tools against the assay. In this investigation of potential SARS-CoV-2 epitopes we found that current prediction tools vary in performance when assessing binding stability, and they are highly dependent on the MHC allele in question. Designing a COVID-19 vaccine where only a few epitope targets are included is therefore a very challenging task. Here, we present 174 SARS-CoV-2 epitopes with high prediction binding scores, validated to bind stably to 11 HLA alleles. Our findings may contribute to the design of an efficacious vaccine against COVID-19.","Prachar, Marek; Justesen, Sune; Steen-Jensen, Daniel Bisgaard; Thorgrimsen, Stephan; Jurgons, Erik; Winther, Ole; Bagger, Frederik Otzen",Sci Rep,148,29

We aimed to quantify the severity of COVID-19 infection on high-resolution chest computed tomography (CT) and to determine its relationship with clinical parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 11, 2020, to February 5, 2020, the clinical, laboratory, and high-resolution CT features of 42 patients (26-75 years, 25 males) with COVID-19 were analyzed. The initial and follow-up CT, obtained a mean of 4.5 days and 11.6 days from the illness onset were retrospectively assessed for the severity and progression of pneumonia. Correlations among clinical parameters, initial CT features, and progression of opacifications were evaluated with Spearman correlation and linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients (83%) exhibited a progressive process according to CT features during the early stage from onset. Follow-up CT findings showed progressive opacifications, consolidation, interstitial thickening, fibrous strips, and air bronchograms, compared with initial CT (all P < 0.05). Before regular treatments, there was a moderate correlation between the days from onset and sum score of opacifications (R = 0.68, P < 0.01). The C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and lactate dehydrogenase showed significantly positive correlation with the severity of pneumonia assessed on initial CT (Rrange, 0.36-0.75; P < 0.05). The highest temperature and the severity of opacifications assessed on initial CT were significantly related to the progression of opacifications on follow-up CT (P = 0.001-0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with the COVID-19 infection usually presented with typical ground glass opacities and other CT features, which showed significant correlations with some clinical and laboratory measurements. Follow-up CT images often demonstrated progressions during the early stage from illness onset.","Xiong, Ying; Sun, Dong; Liu, Yao; Fan, Yanqing; Zhao, Lingyun; Li, Xiaoming; Zhu, Wenzhen",Invest Radiol,148,26

The alteration of local marine ecosystems towards a more temperate state and the appearance/range expansion of subarctic-boreal species at higher latitudes is a complex phenomenon induced mainly by the changing properties of Atlantic water (AW) transported from the south. Areas under the direct influence of AW experience biological Atlantification of their communities on all trophic levels, resulting in the growing complexity of arctic food webs. Here, besides summarising the main documented messages of biological Atlantification, we take a critical view on the threat posed on Arctic marine communities. We take into account the formation of the Arctic marine fauna, as well as the nature of (re)colonisation of Arctic sites by boreal organisms when evaluating the extent of the issue. We take a look at the history of Arctic colonisations by boreal organisms in an attempt to identify 'neonative taxa returning home'. We also highlight the role of floating plastic debris as an 'instrument from the toolbox of the Anthropocene' aiding the distribution of marine taxa.","Csapó, Hedvig Kriszta; Grabowski, Michal; Weslawski, Jan Marcin",Sci Total Environ,148,10

Here we present a scalable method for preparing Cu electrocatalysts that favor CO2 conversion to C2+ products with faradaic efficiencies up to 72%. Grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction data confirms that anodic halogenation of electropolished Cu foils in aqueous solutions of KCl, KBr, or KI creates surfaces of CuCl, CuBr, or CuI, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy studies show that significant changes to the morphology of Cu occur during anodic halogenation and subsequent oxide-formation and reduction, resulting in catalysts with a high density of defect sites but relatively low roughness. This work shows that efficient conversion of CO2 to C2+ products requires a Cu catalyst with a high density of defect sites that promote adsorption of carbon intermediates and C-C coupling reactions while minimizing roughness.","Kim, Taehee; Palmore, G Tayhas R",Nat Commun,148,1

METHODS: Invitations for this survey were sent out as a collaborative effort of the European Society of Minimally Invasive Neurological Therapy (ESMINT), the Society of NeuroInterventional Surgery (SNIS), the Sociedad Iberolatinoamericana de Neuroradiologia Diagnostica y Terapeutica (SILAN), the Society of Vascular and Interventional Neurology (SVIN), and the World Federation of Interventional and Therapeutic Neuroradiology (WFITN). RESULTS: Overall, 475 participants from 61 countries responded (six from Africa (1%), 81 from Asia (17%), 156 from Europe (33%), 53 from Latin America (11%), and 172 from North America (11%)). The majority of participants (96%) reported being able to provide emergency services, though 26% of these reported limited resources. A decrease in emergency procedures was reported by 69% of participants (52% in ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, 11% ischemic, and 6% hemorrhagic stroke alone). Only 4% reported an increase in emergency cases. The emerging need for social distancing and the rapid adoption of remote communication was reflected in the interest in establishing case discussion forums (43%), general online forums (37%), and access to angio video streaming for live mentoring and support (33%).

It caused severe respiratory tract infections and a significant proportion of patients with gastrointestinal symptoms. Several studies have investigated the intestinal flora of COVID-19. However, so far there has been no evidence demonstrating the evidence on the association of COVID-19 with intestinal flora through meta-analysis. A systematic and comprehensive understanding of their relationship is essential to provide public health prevention or treatment strategy. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This systematic review and meta-analysis will be reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Observational studies (cohort studies, case-control, and cross-sectional studies) and clinical trials will be eligible. Studies eligible for inclusion must contain participants with COVID-19. Systematic searches will be conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Ovid, EBSCO, World Health Organization COVID-19 database, China National Knowledge Internet, WanFang Data, Chinese Scientific and Technological Journal Database, and Chinese Biomedical Databases. A pre-designed search strategy of medical subject headings and free text terms for COVID-19 and intestinal flora will be used. Two reviewers will independently screen the titles and abstracts, followed by full-text screening. Discrepancies will be resolved by consensus with a third reviewer. The reviewers will then extract data from each eligible article based on PECOS (Population, Exposure, Comparator, Outcomes, and Study design). The risk of bias and quality of included studies will be assessed using an appropriate tool. A random-effects meta-analysis will be considered where there are sufficiently homogeneous studies; otherwise, a narrative synthesis will be conducted. Heterogeneity among studies will be assessed using I statistics. If substantial heterogeneity detected, subgroup analyses and meta-regression will be conducted to look for the potential causes.

On the one hand, we believe that the distinguished contributions in disease containment efforts by healthcare professionals indicated that our medical education system has achieved its intended outcomes and is socially accountable. On the other hand, we have also identified three major issues that need to be addressed from an educational standpoint: insufficient emphasis on public health emergency preparedness; unsophisticated mechanisms for interdisciplinary cooperation; and inadequate guidance in medical ethics. Whilst these reflections might be seen in its summative form, we would suggest changing it to that of a formative process, where we learn from our assessment through observation and feedback of the gaps, upon which improvement of our present situation can be made.

The over-hoarding of toilet paper has received a lot of negative public attention. In this work, we used Twitter data to qualitatively analyse tweets related to panic buying of toilet paper during the crisis. Methods: A total of 255,171 tweets were collected. Of these 4081 met our inclusion criteria and 100 tweets were randomly selected to develop a coding scheme in the initial phase. Random samples of tweets in folds of 100 were then qualitatively analysed in the focused coding phase until saturation was met at 500 tweets analysed. Results: Five key themes emerged: (1) humour or sarcasm, (2) marketing or profiteering, (3) opinion and emotions, (4) personal experience, and (5) support or information. About half of the tweets carried negative sentiments, expressing anger or frustration towards the deficiency of toilet paper and the frantic situation of toilet paper hoarding, which were among the most influential tweets. Discussion: Panic buying of toilet paper was seen during the 2020 pandemic period with a mass amount of related content spread across social media. The spontaneous contagion of fear and panic through social media could fuel psychological reactions in midst of crises. The high level of negative social media posts regarding the toilet paper crisis acts as an emotional trigger of public anxiety and panic.

All newborns from SARS-CoV-2 positive mothers were tested via nasopharyngeal swab at birth, on day 3 and/or day 7. In case of positive result, they were re-tested on day 14. Results: Fifteen women tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. All newborns except one were born at term. All of them were non-infected at birth, irrespective of mode of delivery; 13 out 15 remained negative; the two positive neonates became negative by day 14 of life. All of them have always remained asymptomatic. All newborns except two were allowed to have immediate bonding, permanent rooming-in, and direct breastfeeding. Conclusions: Our study supports the claim that COVID-19 in pregnancy is not associated with worse clinical outcomes compared to non-COVID-19 pregnant women and/or with higher rates of preterm birth and intrauterine growth restriction. Intrauterine vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 seems to be unlikely. Breastfeeding appears to be safe and protective for the neonate, once appropriate preventive measures are adopted.","Biasucci, Giacomo; Cannalire, Giuseppe; Raymond, Akamin; Capra, Maria Elena; Benenati, Belinda; Vadacca, Giovanni; Schiavo, Roberta; Pavesi, Cristiana; Bonini, Renza",Front Pediatr,148,29

In these facilities, viral transmission can be facilitated by shortages of human and material resources, which can lead to suboptimal application of infection prevention and control (IPC) procedures. To improve the dissemination of COVID-19 IPC guidelines, we developed a serious game called ""Escape COVID-19"" using Nicholson's RECIPE for meaningful gamification, as engaging serious games have the potential to induce behavioral change. OBJECTIVE: As the probability of executing an action is strongly linked to the intention of performing it, the objective of this study was to determine whether LTCF employees were willing to change their IPC practices after playing ""Escape COVID-19."" METHODS: This was a web-based, triple-blind, randomized controlled trial, which took place between November 5 and December 4, 2020. The health authorities of Geneva, Switzerland, asked the managers of all LTCFs under their jurisdiction to forward information regarding the study to all their employees, regardless of professional status. Participants were unaware that they would be randomly allocated to one of two different study paths upon registration. In the control group, participants filled in a first questionnaire designed to gather demographic data and assess baseline knowledge before accessing regular online IPC guidelines. They then answered a second questionnaire, which assessed their willingness to change their IPC practices and identified the reasons underlying their decision. They were then granted access to the serious game. Conversely, the serious game group played ""Escape COVID-19"" after answering the first questionnaire but before answering the second one. This group accessed the control material after answering the second set of questions. There was no time limit. The primary outcome was the proportion of LTCF employees willing to change their IPC practices. Secondary outcomes included the factors underlying participants' decisions, the domains these changes would affect, changes in the use of protective equipment items, and attrition at each stage of the study. RESULTS: A total of 295 answer sets were analyzed. Willingness to change behavior was higher in the serious game group (82% [119/145] versus 56% [84/150]; P<.001), with an odds ratio of 3.86 (95% CI 2.18-6.81; P<.001) after adjusting for professional category and baseline knowledge, using a mixed effects logistic regression model with LTCF as a random effect. For more than two-thirds (142/203) of the participants, the feeling of playing an important role against the epidemic was the most important factor explaining their willingness to change behavior. Most of the participants unwilling to change their behavior answered that they were already applying all the guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: The serious game ""Escape COVID-19"" was more successful than standard IPC material in convincing LTCF employees to adopt COVID-19-safe IPC behavior.

It is surprising to see that related to public health but also psychological factors and sequelae of the pandemic, a broad knowledge was already available based upon former pandemics and disasters long before the outbreak of COVID-19. This knowledge has been used very sparsely, if at all, for health political decisions. In view of the social significance of the pandemic and its social impact, findings from group psychology and group dynamics seem to be specifically important for a better understanding of behavior within the population as well as the conceptualization of public health interventions. An increase in psychological disorders was described related to the pandemic. For the treatment of these disorders, a range of psychotherapeutic approaches including evidence-based group psychotherapy are available. Whereas the use of telemedical and digital techniques is increasingly more common within individual psychotherapy, many questions are still open related to online group treatment.","Strauß, Bernhard; Berger, Uwe; Rosendahl, Jenny",Psychotherapeut (Berl),148,26

At present, there is no definite and effective treatment for COVID-19. ACE2 plays an important role in the RAS, and the imbalance between ACE/Ang II/AT1R pathway and ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas receptor pathway in the RAS system will lead to multi-system inflammation. Increased ACE and Ang II are poor prognostic factors for severe pneumonia. Animal studies have shown that RAS inhibitors could effectively relieve symptoms of acute severe pneumonia and respiratory failure. The binding of COVID-19 and ACE2 resulted in the exhaustion of ACE2, and then ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas receptor pathway was inhibited. The balance of the RAS system was broken, and this would lead to the exacerbation of acute severe pneumonia. Therefore, we speculate that ACEI and AT1R inhibitors could be used in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia under the condition of controlling blood pressure, and might reduce the pulmonary inflammatory response and mortality.","Sun, M L; Yang, J M; Sun, Y P; Su, G H",Zhonghua Jie He He Hu Xi Za Zhi,148,16

The authors relied on unique governance variables extracted from the Bloomberg database to develop the governance deviance index.FindingsStudy unveils that deviance from governance practices influences firm’s performance. Consequently, it can be said that the firms which use innovative governance mechanisms, usually stay ahead of the market by leading the governance trends. The findings also generalise the firm’s entrepreneurial identity and organisational ecology perspectives.Research limitations/implicationsResearch implies that the firm’s entrepreneurial identity demands innovative managerial control. This study is focused on the US financial market, but in future, researchers could revalidate the deviance index. Scholars can also use mixed methods to test the need for innovative governance mechanisms in emerging markets.Practical implicationsThe firms should focus on innovative governance practices not only to safeguard the firm’s entrepreneurial identity but also to pursue the growth objectives.

With the increasing number of recovered patients, more attention should be paid to the follow-up of these patients. METHODS: In the study, 576 patients with COVID-19 discharged from hospital in Chongqing, China from January 24, 2020, to March 10, 2020 were evaluated by viral nucleic acid tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) to determine if they could be released from quarantine. Among the 576 patients, 61 patients (10.6%) had positive RT-PCR test results of SARS-CoV-2. We aimed to analyze the demographics, clinical characteristics and treatment of 61 patients. RESULTS: These positive patients were characterized by older age, chronic medical illness and mild conditions. 38 (62.3%) patients who were asymptomatic without abnormalities on chest radiographs were found in the positive with COVID-19. Also, they showed positive results of stool or sputum specimens with negative results of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens. The median duration of positive result of SARS-CoV-2 was varied from 3 days to 35 days in the patients discharged from hospital with no family member infection. CONCLUSIONS: Multi-site screening of SARS-CoV-2 including nasal and pharyngeal swabs, stool and sputum specimens could be considered to improve the diagnosis, treatment and infection control in patients with COVID-19. Our findings provide the important information and clinical evidence for the improved management of patients recovered from COVID-19.","Deng, Wang; Guang, Tian-Wen; Yang, Mei; Li, Jian-Rong; Jiang, De-Peng; Li, Chang-Yi; Wang, Dao-Xin",BMC Infect Dis,148,14

We consider particular impacts on noninferiority clinical trials, which aim to show that an investigational treatment is not markedly worse than an existing active control with known benefit. Because interpretation of noninferiority trials requires cross-trial validation involving untestable assumptions, it is vital that they be run to very high standards. The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced an unexpected impact on clinical trials, with subjects possibly missing treatment or assessments due to unforeseen intercurrent events. The resulting data must be carefully considered to ensure proper statistical inference. Missing data can often, but not always, be considered missing completely at random (MCAR). We discuss ways to ensure validity of the analyses through study conduct and data analysis, with focus on the hypothetical strategy for constructing estimands. We assess various analytic strategies of analyzing longitudinal binary data with dropouts where outcomes may be MCAR or missing at random (MAR). Simulations show that certain multiple imputation strategies control the Type I error rate and provide additional power over analysis of observed data when data are MCAR or MAR, with weaker assumptions about the missing data mechanism.","Wiens, Brian L.; Lipkovich, Ilya",Stat.

Tais doenças podem afetar de forma irreversível populações de espécies silvestres e, sobretudo comprometer do ponto de vista sanitário, produtivo e comercial a criação de animais domésticos de produção. A nova concepção da Organização Mundial de Saúde Animal sobre a importância da introdução das espécies silvestres nos sistemas de vigilância de doenças notificáveis, o significativo aumento de eventos de doenças emergentes cujo reservatório é um animal silvestre e a necessidade de preservação da nossa biodiversidade levou ao estudo de um modelo teórico de sistema de monitoramento de doenças de animais silvestres e domésticos em uma unidade de conservação de uso sustentável. Setenta por cento das unidades de conservação criadas pelo Estado de São Paulo são de uso sustentável. Como ali a permanência de residentes é permitida, acredita-se que o desafio da convivência entre seres humanos, animais domésticos e silvestres é ainda maior. Além disso, a corrente neo conservacionista atual tende a defender a permanência de comunidades tradicionais em áreas naturais protegidas. Com todos esses fatores, decidiu-se tomar como modelo de estudo a unidade de conservação de uso sustentável da Serra do Japi, pois ela constitui uma área de transição de ecossistemas e, portanto, possui uma riquíssima fauna e mais de 100 propriedades rurais com criação de animais domésticos. Inicialmente, a estratégia foi fazer um diagnóstico da situação sanitária dos animais domésticos de produção e ao mesmo tempo analisar as possibilidades de implantação de um monitoramento das doenças de animais silvestres e domésticos na Serra do Japi. O grande desafio identificado no estudo foi definir a metodologia a ser empregada para que seja possível estabelecer uma rotina de coleta de amostras e introduzi-las em um sistema de monitoramento permanente visando posteriormente a criação de um sistema de vigilância. Outro desafio será reunir entidades afins, porém heterogêneas em sua concepção e organização, com o propósito de tornar factível a implantação de um sistema futuro de vigilância de doença de animais silvestres para o Estado de São Paulo.

Existing literature indicates that several messaging approaches may be effective, including emphasising the benefits to the recipient, aligning with the recipient's moral values and focusing on protecting others. Current research suggests that prosocial public health messages that highlight behaviours linked to societal benefits (eg, protecting 'each other'), rather than focusing on behaviours that protect oneself (eg, protecting 'yourself'), may be a more effective method for communicating strategies related to infectious disease. To investigate this we will conduct a systematic review that will identify what messages and behaviour change techniques have the potential to optimise the effect on population behaviour in relation to reducing transmission of respiratory infections. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A systematic literature search of published and unpublished studies (including grey literature) in electronic databases will be conducted to identify those that meet our inclusion criteria. The search will be run in four electronic databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Scopus. We will also conduct supplementary searches in databases of 'grey' literature such as PsycEXTRA, Social Science Research Network and OSF PREPRINTS, and use the Google Scholar search engine. A systematic approach to searching, screening, reviewing and data extraction will be applied based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. Titles, abstracts and full texts for eligibility will be examined independently by researchers. The quality of the included studies will be assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies-of Interventions tool. Disagreements will be resolved by a consensus procedure. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This protocol has been registered with PROSPERO.

METHODS: Data were collected from a large sample of the Norwegian population (n = 4008) through the Norwegian Citizen Panel (NCP). A linear regression was conducted to examine the effects of COVID-19 related risk factors on psychological distress, using the 10-item Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL-10). Finally, we conducted a moderation analysis to examine the interaction of trust in the healthcare system and COVID-19 related risk factors. RESULTS: A linear regression showed that female gender, younger age, lower level of education, being infected with COVID-19, being medically vulnerable, working in the healthcare system, being in voluntary quarantine and having an immigrant background predicted mean HSCL-10 scores. The moderation analysis revealed that people in the medically vulnerable group, those below 61, and those in quarantine reported higher psychological distress when they also had lower trust in the healthcare system.

Nonetheless, evidence-based prevention programs are not widely implemented in schools, even though they are commonplace for easy access to adolescents. The primary objective of this systematic review was to assess the scope and efficacy of adolescent obesity intervention strategies in Australian schools, to guide future research. Seven electronic databases were searched for peer-reviewed school-based intervention articles written in the English language and targeting 12-18-year-old adolescents. Intervention characteristics were extracted, and quality, efficacy and outcome measures were assessed utilizing thirteen studies that met the inclusion criteria for this review. Most of the Australian adolescent obesity research emanated from the State of New South Wales and none were nationwide. Five studies successfully met all the requirements in all measured outcomes, four met at least one measured outcome and the remaining four were unsuccessful. Despite the weak evidence of intervention efficacy for most of the reviewed studies, school-based interventions with multi-component combinations of physical activity, nutrition and alignment to a theory yielded promising results. Our findings point to the need for future research to assess the perceptions of school stakeholders in relation to the barriers and enablers to establishing school-based prevention and intervention programs for adolescents.","Buru, Kakale; Emeto, Theophilus I; Malau-Aduli, Aduli E O; Malau-Aduli, Bunmi S",,148,20

At december 2020 in Italy, more than 2 million people have contracted the virus and 78,755 people have died. The scientific community is studying and testing numerous compounds that can be effective and safe for treating people with covid-19. AIM: To synthesize and evaluate the quality of evidence of efficacy and safety for the treatment. The available evidence is summarized in a living systematic review, a review that is constantly updated on the basis of the results of the new clinical studies. METHODS: A bibliographic search is launched weekly on the electronic databases and on the main clinical trial registers. Two researchers independently select the articles and assess the quality of the studies using the criteria developed by the Cochrane Collaboration, the certainty of the overall quality of the evidence is assessed using the GRADE criteria. RESULTS: At 31/12/2020, 101 randomized controlled studies were included that consider 72 different comparisons and include a total of 55,281 patients. 37 drugs are tested with respect to the standard treatment, 6 are evaluated against placebo and finally 29 compare different drugs with each other. By selecting studies that evaluate the efficacy and safety of a drug compared to standard treatment, which include at least 2 studies and which have low to high certainty of evidence, results show that corticosteroids, remdesivir, favipiravir, immunoglobulins, colchicine, and umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell infusion could reduce overall mortality. No differences for the risk of any adverse events are observed between convalescent plasma and remdesivir compared to standard treatment. Remdesivir probably reduces the risk of serious adverse events; a similar effect, although less strong, is also noted for tocilizumab and the lopinavir-ritonavir combination. In contrast, hydroxychloroquine, corticosteroids and convalescent plasma transfusion are associated with safety concerns with respect to the risk of serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: The 101 studies included consider 72 comparisons and numerous outcomes, the results often coming from single studies and of small dimensions, and for 61% with a very low certainty of evidence, are difficult to summarize and the final result is to increase the uncertainty rather than providing useful information to the clinic and research. From all the work carried out it seems to us that the pandemic has highlighted the many shadows of scientific literature as tool to improve knowledge.","Cruciani, Fabio; Amato, Laura; De Crescenzo, Franco; Mitrova, Zuzana; Saulle, Rosella; Vecchi, Simona; Davoli, Marina",Recenti Prog Med,148,1

This purple phototroph is characterized by the presence of both rhodoquinone (RQ) and ubiquinone as electron carriers and bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) a esterified at the propionic acid side chain by geranylgeraniol (BChl aG) instead of phytol. Despite intensive efforts, the structure of the light-harvesting-reaction center (LH1-RC) core complex from Rsp. rubrum remains at low resolutions. Using cryo-EM, here we present a robust new view of the Rsp. rubrum LH1-RC at 2.76 Å resolution. The LH1 complex forms a closed, slightly elliptical ring structure with 16 &#945;ß-polypeptides surrounding the RC. Our biochemical analysis detected RQ molecules in the purified LH1-RC, and the cryo-EM density map specifically positions RQ at the QA site in the RC. The geranylgeraniol side chains of BChl aG coordinated by LH1 ß-polypeptides exhibit a highly homologous tail-up conformation that allows for interactions with the bacteriochlorin rings of nearby LH1 &#945;-associated BChls aG. The structure also revealed key protein-protein interactions in both N- and C-terminal regions of the LH1 &#945;ß-polypeptides, mainly within a face-to-face structural subunit. Our high-resolution Rsp. rubrum LH1-RC structure provides new insight for evaluating past experimental and computational results obtained with this old organism over many decades and lays the foundation for more detailed exploration of light-energy conversion, quinone transport, and structure-function relationships in this pigment-protein complex.","Tani, Kazutoshi; Kanno, Ryo; Ji, Xuan-Cheng; Hall, Malgorzata; Yu, Long-Jiang; Kimura, Yukihiro; Madigan, Michael T; Mizoguchi, Akira; Humbel, Bruno M; Wang-Otomo, Zheng-Yu",Biochemistry,148,16

It is associated with high mortality in those who develop respiratory complications and require admission to intensive care. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a supportive therapy option for selected severely ill patients who deteriorate despite the best supportive care. During the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, extra demand led to staff reorganization; hence, cardiac surgery consultants joined the ECMO retrieval team. This article describes how we increased service provisions to adapt to the changes in activity and staffing. METHODS: The data were collected from 16 March 2020 to 8 May 2020. The patients were referred through a dedicated Web-based referral portal to cope with increasing demand. The retrieval team attended the referring hospital, reviewed the patients and made the final decision to proceed with ECMO. RESULTS: We reported 41 ECMO retrieval runs during this study period. Apart from staffing changes, other retrieval protocols were maintained. The preferred cannulation method for veno-venous ECMO was drainage via the femoral vein and return to the right internal jugular vein. There were no complications reported during cannulation or transport. CONCLUSIONS: Staff reorganization in a crisis is of paramount importance. For those with precise transferrable skills, experience can be gained quickly with appropriate supervision. Therefore, the team members were selected based on skill mix rather than on roles that are more traditional. We have demonstrated that an ECMO retrieval service can be reorganized swiftly and successfully to cope with the sudden increase in demand by spending cardiac surgeons services to supplement the anaesthetic-intensivist roles.","Rafiq, Muhammad U; Valchanov, Kamen; Vuylsteke, Alain; Taghavi, Fouad J; Iyer, Swetha B; Sudarshan, Catherine D; Fowles, Jo-Anne; Anderson, Simon; Govender, Pooveshni; Holmes, Miranda; White, Alexander; Mishra, Abhi; Mwaura, Lucy; Jenkins, David P",Eur J Cardiothorac Surg,148,1

METHODS: All patients over 28 days old testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 between March 1 and September 30, 2020, were retrospectively identified and characterized through electronic analysis at Stanford. A sub-cohort was followed prospectively to evaluate long-term COVID-19 symptoms. RESULTS: 168,190 patients underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing, and 6,976 (4.15%) tested positive. In a multivariate analysis, asthma was not an independent risk factor for hospitalization (OR 1.12 [95% CI 0.86, 1.45], p = .40). Among SARS-CoV-2-positive asthmatics, allergic asthma lowered the risk of hospitalization and had a protective effect compared with non-allergic asthma (OR 0.52 [0.28, 0.91], p = .026); there was no association between baseline medication use as characterized by GINA and hospitalization risk. Patients with severe COVID-19 disease had lower eosinophil levels during hospitalization compared with patients with mild or asymptomatic disease, independent of asthma status (p = .0014). In a patient sub-cohort followed longitudinally, asthmatics and non-asthmatics had similar time to resolution of COVID-19 symptoms, particularly lower respiratory symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Asthma is not a risk factor for more severe COVID-19 disease. Allergic asthmatics were half as likely to be hospitalized with COVID-19 compared with non-allergic asthmatics. Lower levels of eosinophil counts (allergic biomarkers) were associated with a more severe COVID-19 disease trajectory. Recovery was similar among asthmatics and non-asthmatics with over 50% of patients reporting ongoing lower respiratory symptoms 3 months post-infection.","Eggert, Lauren E; He, Ziyuan; Collins, William; Lee, Alexandra S; Dhondalay, Gopal; Jiang, Shirley Y; Fitzpatrick, Jessica; Snow, Theo T; Pinsky, Benjamin A; Artandi, Maja; Barman, Linda; Puri, Rajan; Wittman, Richard; Ahuja, Neera; Blomkalns, Andra; O039,; Hara, Ruth; Cao, Shu; Desai, Manisha; Sindher, Sayantani B; Nadeau, Kari; Chinthrajah, R Sharon",Allergy,148,29

In particular, we analyze the spread of propaganda and its interplay with coordinated behavior on a large Twitter dataset about the 2019 UK general election. We first propose and evaluate several metrics for measuring the use of propaganda on Twitter. Then, we investigate the use of propaganda by different coordinated communities that participated in the online debate. The combination of the use of propaganda and coordinated behavior allows us to uncover the authenticity and harmfulness of the different communities. Finally, we compare our measures of propaganda and coordination with automation (i.e., bot) scores and Twitter suspensions, revealing interesting trends. From a theoretical viewpoint, we introduce a methodology for analyzing several important dimensions of online behavior that are seldom conjointly considered. From a practical viewpoint, we provide new insights into authentic and inauthentic online activities during the 2019 UK general election.","Hristakieva, Kristina; Cresci, Stefano; Martino, Giovanni Da San; Conti, Mauro; Nakov, Preslav",,148,27

Although it shows some specific symptoms, this disease, which can show different symptoms in almost every individual, has caused hundreds of thousands of patients to die. Although healthcare professionals work hard to prevent further loss of life, the rate of disease spread is very high. For this reason, the help of computer aided diagnosis (CAD) and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms is vital. In this study, a method based on optimization of convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, which is the most effective image analysis method of today, is proposed to fulfill the mentioned COVID-19 detection needs. First, COVID-19 images are trained using ResNet-50 and VGG-16 architectures. Then, features in the last layer of these two architectures are combined with feature fusion. These new image features matrices obtained with feature fusion are classified for COVID detection. A multi-layer perceptron (MLP) structure optimized by the whale optimization algorithm is used for the classification process. The obtained results show that the performance of the proposed framework is almost 4.5% higher than VGG-16 performance and almost 3.5% higher than ResNet-50 performance.","Ozturk, Saban; Yigit, Enes; Ozkaya, Umut",,148,16

The basic question is why, in contrast to other ""respiratory"" viruses, SARS-CoV-2 infection can result in such multi-systemic, life-threatening complications and a severe pulmonary vasculopathy. It is widely known that SARS-CoV-2 uses membrane-bound angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor, resulting in internalisation of the complex by the host cell. We discuss the evidence that failure to suppress coronaviral replication within 5 days results in sustained downregulation of ACE2 protein expression, and that ACE2 is under negative-feedback regulation. We then expose openly-available experimental repository data that demonstrate the gene for ACE2 lies in a novel cluster of interegulated genes on the X chromosome including PIR encoding pirin (quercetin 2,3-dioxygenase), and VEGFD encoding the predominantly lung-expressed vascular endothelial growth factor D. The five double-elite enhancer/promoters that are known to be operational, and shared read-through lncRNA transcripts, imply that ongoing SARS-CoV-2 infection will reduce host defences to reactive oxygen species, directly generate superoxide O2 - and H2O2 (a ""ROS storm""), and impair pulmonary endothelial homeostasis. Published cellular responses to oxidative stress complete the loop to pathophysiology observed in severe COVID-19. Thus for patients who fail to rapidly suppress viral replication, the newly-appreciated ACE2 co-regulated cluster predicts delayed responses that would account for catastrophic deteriorations. We conclude that ACE2 homeostatic drives provide a unified understanding which should help optimise therapeutic approaches during the wait until safe, effective vaccines and antiviral therapies for SARS-CoV-2 are delivered.","Shovlin, Claire L; Vizcaychipi, Marcela P",QJM,148,33

The NCJDRSU performs high-fidelity surveillance, assessing all cases of suspected CJD referred to the unit. COVID-19 has caused widespread disruption to healthcare and poses a threat to services. The NCJDRSU converted to telehealth-based surveillance in March 2020. We report the results of the application of telehealth for comprehensive CJD surveillance during the first four months of the pandemic. 59 cases were assessed for suspected CJD. In 52 cases the relatives were interviewed for an informant history, by video conference or telephone call. 34 patients underwent video examination; 1 case was examined in-person. MRI images were assessed in all cases and 46 underwent CSF testing. Feedback was obtained from interviewees and the NCJDRSU team on their experiences. 50 cases were diagnosed with sporadic CJD; 5 received an alternative diagnosis, and the remaining 4 remained unresolved, with further investigations underway.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: East London Pancreatic Cancer Epidemiology (EL-PaC-Epidem) Study at Barts Health National Health Service Trust, UK. Linked electronic health records were interrogated on a cohort of participants (age &#8805;18 years), reported with HPB conditions between 1 April 2008 and 6 March 2020. PARTICIPANTS: EL-PaC-Epidem Study participants, alive on 12 February 2020, and living in East London within the previous 6 months (n=15 440). The cohort represents a multi-ethnic population with 51.7% belonging to the non-White background. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: COVID-19 incidence and mortality. RESULTS: Some 226 (1.5%) participants had confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis between 12 February and 12 June 2020, with increased odds for men (OR 1.56; 95% CI 1.2 to 2.04) and Black ethnicity (2.04; 1.39 to 2.95) as well as patients with moderate to severe liver disease (2.2; 1.35 to 3.59). Each additional comorbidity increased the odds of infection by 62%. Substance misusers were at more risk of infection, so were patients on vitamin D treatment. The higher ORs in patients with chronic pancreatic or mild liver conditions, age >70, and a history of smoking or obesity were due to coexisting comorbidities. Increased odds of death were observed for men (3.54; 1.68 to 7.85) and Black ethnicity (3.77; 1.38 to 10.7). Patients having respiratory complications from COVID-19 without a history of chronic respiratory disease also had higher odds of death (5.77; 1.75 to 19). CONCLUSIONS: In this large population-based study of patients with HPB conditions, men, Black ethnicity, pre-existing moderate to severe liver conditions, six common medical multimorbidities, substance misuse and a history of vitamin D treatment independently posed higher odds of acquiring COVID-19 compared with their respective counterparts. The odds of death were significantly high for men and Black people.","Dayem Ullah, Abu Z M; Sivapalan, Lavanya; Kocher, Hemant M; Chelala, Claude",BMJ Open,148,26

To achieve this goal, we propose an alternative approach to the methodology exploiting survey data, which is based solely on data from administrative registers and online sources and relies on dual system estimation (DSE). As these sources do not cover the whole reference population and the number of units appearing in all datasets is small, we have developed a DSE approach for negatively dependent sources based on a recent work by Chatterjee and Bhuyan (2020). To achieve the main goal we conducted a thorough data cleaning procedure in order to remove out-of-scope units, identify entities from the target population, and link them by identifiers to minimize linkage errors. We verified the effectiveness and sensitivity of the proposed estimator in simulation studies. From a practical point of view, our results show that the current vacancy survey in Poland underestimates the number of entities with at least one vacancy by about 10-15%. The main reasons for this discrepancy are non-sampling errors due to non-response and under-reporting, which is identified by comparing survey data with administrative data.","Berkesewicz, Maciej; Cherniaiev, Herman; Pater, Robert",,148,30

Purpose: The actual sanitary crisis led to a massive mobilization of the sanitary system toward intensive care units and management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. However, some patients still require spinal interventions. The present study aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on spine surgical in a moderate COVID-19 cluster region. Overview of Literature: Previous studies have reported screening and management of patients with spinal conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, to date, knowledge, no observational study on spine surgeries during the pandemic has not been reported. Methods: Between March 17, 2020 and April 17, 2020, information on spine surgical activity was prospectively collected at our institution. This surgical activity related to the first month of confinement in France was compared to the activity during the same period in 2019 to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on surgical activities. Results: In order to reduce the contamination rate of patients and medical staff during hospitalization, the spine department was completely reorganized. Non-urgent elective spine surgeries were cancelled. When considering the global amount of surgeries procedures during the first month of confinement, a decrease of almost 50% was observed in the number of surgical procedures. During the study period, 62 patients were eligible for spine surgery. The numbers of patients managed for tumor and infectious cases were stable, while a considerable reduction was observed in the number of trauma and degenerative cases. During the follow-up period, two patients were tested as COVID+ during the postoperative course, and no cases of medical or paramedical staff contamination were reported using polymerase chain reaction-testing. Conclusions: During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is possible to maintain spine surgical activity. Each surgical procedure must be discussed and organized with all the caregivers involved. Indications for surgery must be in line with the scientific guidelines and adapted to each healthcare facility.","Meyer, Mikael; Prost, Solène; Farah, Kaissar; Denis, Jean-Baptiste; Dufour, Henry; Blondel, Benjamin; Fuentes, Stéphane",,148,1

We first suggest a closed-form expression for calculating the proximal operator of the Cauchy prior, which then makes it applicable in generic proximal splitting algorithms. We further derive the required condition for minimisation problems with the Cauchy based penalty function that guarantees convergence to the global minimum even though it is non-convex. Setting the system parameters by satisfying the proposed condition keeps the overall cost function convex and it can be minimised via the forward-backward (FB) algorithm. The proposed method based on Cauchy regularisation is evaluated by solving two generic signal processing examples, i.e. 1D signal denoising in the frequency domain and two image reconstruction tasks including de-blurring and denoising. We experimentally verify the proposed convexity conditions for various cases, and show the effectiveness of the proposed Cauchy based non-convex penalty function over state-of-the-art penalty functions such as L1 and total variation (TV) norms.","Karakus, Oktay; Mayo, Perla; Achim, Alin",,148,16

To get the world back on track, hundreds of vaccines are under development. A deeper understanding of how the immune system responds to SARS-CoV-2 re-infection will certainly help. Studies have highlighted various aspects of T cell response in resolving acute infection and preventing re-infections. Lung resident memory T (TRM) cells are sentinels in the secondary immune response. They are mostly differentiated from effector T cells, construct specific niches and stay permanently in lung tissues. If the infection recurs, locally activated lung TRM cells can elicit rapid immune response against invading pathogens. In addition, they can significantly limit tumor growth or lead to pathologic immune responses. Vaccines targeting TRM cells are under development, with the hope to induce stable and highly reactive lung TRM cells through mucosal administration or ""prime-and-pull"" strategy. In this review, we will summarize recent advances in lung TRM cell generation and maintenance, explore their roles in different diseases and discuss how these cells may guide the development of future vaccines targeting infectious disease, cancer, and pathologic immune response.","Qian, Youkun; Zhu, Yicheng; Li, Yangyang; Li, Bin",Front Immunol,148,26

The area under the curve (AUC) for COV50 as a continuously distributed variable was 0·80 (0·72-0·88) for mortality and 0·74 (0·66-0·81) for worsening WHO score. The optimised COV50 thresholds for mortality and worsening WHO score were 0·47 and 0·04 with sensitivity/specificity of 87·0 (74·6%) and 77·1 (63·9%), respectively. On top of covariates, COV50 improved the AUC, albeit borderline for death, from 0·78 to 0·82 (p = 0·11) and 0·84 (p = 0·052) for mortality and from 0·68 to 0·78 (p = 0·0097) and 0·75 (p = 0·021) for worsening WHO score. The validation cohort findings were confirmatory. Interpretation: this first CRIT-COV-U report proves the concept that urinary proteomic profiling generates biomarkers indicating adverse COVID-19 outcomes, even at an early disease stage, including WHO stages 1-3. These findings need to be consolidated in an upcoming final dataset.","Wendt, Ralph; Thijs, Lutgarde; Kalbitz, Sven; Mischak, Harald; Siwy, Justyna; Raad, Julia; Metzger, Jochen; Neuhaus, Barbara; Leyen, Heiko von der; Dudoignon, Emmanuel; Mebazaa, Alexandre; Spasovski, Goce; Milenkova, Mimoza; Canevska-Talevska, Aleksandra; Czerwienska, Beata; Wiecek, Andrzej; Peters, Björn; Nilsson, Åsa; Schwab, Matthias; Rothfuss, Katja; Lübbert, Christoph; Staessen, Jan A; Beige, Joachim",EClinicalMedicine,148,18

SETTING: Participants were drawn from an existing consent to contact database of PWH. Database candidates were PWH, adults older than 18 years, people who had received HIV care at the University of Miami HIV clinics, people who spoke English or Spanish, and people who had agreed to be contacted for future research. METHODS: An adapted version of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study/Women's Interagency HIV Study Combined Cohort Study COVID-19 survey was telephonically administered, requiring 15-30 minutes. RESULTS: Psychological stress was a predictor of COVID-19 burden (financial and social burden) and COVID-19 risk (health factors associated with an increased risk of severe health outcomes due to infection with COVID-19). Having a history of traumatic events was associated with increased COVID-19 risk, and stress was associated with increased COVID-19 burden and COVID-19 risk. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, results suggest that the intersection of the HIV and COVID-19 pandemics may be most profound among those who have experienced traumatic events; and traumatic events may be associated with heightened vigilance regarding illness and infection.","Jones, Deborah L; Morgan, Kristiana E; Martinez, Paola C; Rodriguez, Violeta J; Vazquez, Andres; Raccamarich, Patricia D; Alcaide, Maria L",J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr,148,20

Although real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT- qPCR) is the current recommended laboratory method to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 acute infection, several factors such as requirement of special equipment and skilled staff limit the use of these time-consuming molecular techniques. Recently, several easy to perform rapid antigen detection tests were developed and recommended in some countries as the first line of diagnostic. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the performances of the Coris COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip test, a rapid immunochromatographic test for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigen, in comparison to RT-qPCR. RESULTS: 148 nasopharyngeal swabs were tested. Amongst the 106 positive RT-qPCR samples, 32 were detected by the rapid antigen test, given an overall sensitivity of 30.2%. All the samples detected positive with the antigen rapid test were also positive with RT-qPCR. CONCLUSIONS: Higher viral loads are associated with better antigen detection rates. Unfortunately, the overall poor sensitivity of the COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip does not allow using it alone as the frontline testing for COVID-19 diagnosis.","Scohy, Anaïs; Anantharajah, Ahalieyah; Bodéus, Monique; Kabamba-Mukadi, Benoît; Verroken, Alexia; Rodriguez-Villalobos, Hector",J Clin Virol,148,10

Thus, an LU approach to patients with suspected COVID-19 is being implemented worldwide. In noncritical COVID-19 patients, 2 new LU signs have been described and proposed, the ""waterfall"" and the ""light beam"" signs. Both signs have been hypothesized to increase the diagnostic accuracy of LU for COVID-19 interstitial pneumonia. In critically ill patients, a distinct pattern of LU changes seems to follow the disease's progression, and this information can be used to guide decisions about when a patient needs to be ventilated, as occurs in other disease states similar to COVID-19. Furthermore, a new algorithm has been published, which enables the automatic detection of B-lines as well as quantification of the percentage of the pleural line associated with lung disease. In COVID-19 patients, a direct involvement of cardiac function has been demonstrated, and ventilator-induced diaphragm dysfunction might be present due to the prolonged mechanical ventilation often involved, as reported for similar diseases. For this reason, cardiac and diaphragm ultrasound evaluation are highly important. Last but not least, due to the thrombotic tendency of COVID-19 patients, particular attention also should be paid to vascular ultrasound. This review is primarily devoted to the study of LU in COVID-19 patients. The authors explain the significance of its ""light and shadows,"" bearing in mind the context in which LU is being used-the emergency department and the intensive care setting. The use of cardiac, vascular, and diaphragm ultrasound is also discussed, as a comprehensive approach to patient care.","Guarracino, Fabio; Vetrugno, Luigi; Forfori, Francesco; Corradi, Francesco; Orso, Daniele; Bertini, Pietro; Ortalda, Alessandro; Federici, Nicola; Copetti, Roberto; Bove, Tiziana",J. cardiothoracic vasc. anest,148,24

Registry data show that patients with cirrhosis may be at high risk. However, outcome comparisons among patients with cirrhosis+COVID-19 versus patients with COVID-19 alone and cirrhosis alone are lacking. The aim of this study was to perform these comparisons. DESIGN: A multicentre study of inpatients with cirrhosis+COVID-19 compared with age/gender-matched patients with COVID-19 alone and cirrhosis alone was performed. COVID-19 and cirrhosis characteristics, development of organ failures and acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) and mortality (inpatient death+hospice) were compared. RESULTS: 37 patients with cirrhosis+COVID-19 were matched with 108 patients with COVID-19 and 127 patients with cirrhosis from seven sites. Race/ethnicity were similar. Patients with cirrhosis+COVID-19 had higher mortality compared with patients with COVID-19 (30% vs 13%, p=0.03) but not between patients with cirrhosis+COVID-19 and patients with cirrhosis (30% vs 20%, p=0.16). Patients with cirrhosis+COVID-19 versus patients with COVID-19 alone had equivalent respiratory symptoms, chest findings and rates of intensive care unit transfer and ventilation. However, patients with cirrhosis+COVID-19 had worse Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI 6.5±3.1 vs 3.3±2.5, p<0.001), lower presenting GI symptoms and higher lactate. Patients with cirrhosis alone had higher cirrhosis-related complications, maximum model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score and lower BiPAP/ventilation requirement compared with patients with cirrhosis+COVID-19, but CCI and ACLF rates were similar. In the entire group, CCI (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.37, p<0.0001) was the only variable predictive of mortality on multivariable regression. CONCLUSIONS: In this multicentre North American contemporaneously enrolled study, age/gender-matched patients with cirrhosis+COVID-19 had similar mortality compared with patients with cirrhosis alone but higher than patients with COVID-19 alone.

Since the first reported cases in Wuhan, China, in late December 2019, humans have been under threat from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (previously known as 2019-nCoV), subsequently declared a pandemic. While the world is searching for expedited approval for a vaccine, which may be only preventative and not a cure, physicians and country leaders are considering several concerted clinical trials suggesting that the age-old antimalarial drugs CQ/HCQ could be a potent therapeutic against COVID-19. Based on accumulating scientific reports, here we highlight the possible modes of action of CQ/HCQ that could justify its use against viral infections. Considering the global health crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic, the option of repurposing old drugs, e.g. CQ/HCQ, particularly HCQ, for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection could be a good choice. CQ/HCQ has diverse modes of action, including alteration of the acidic environment inside lysosomes and late endosomes, preventing endocytosis, exosome release and phagolysosomal fusion, and inhibition of the host cytokine storm. One or more diverse mechanisms might work against viral infections and reduce mortality. As there is no cure for COVID-19, clinical testing of HCQ is urgently required to determine its potency against SARS-CoV-2, as this is the currently available treatment option. There remains a need to find other innovative drug candidates as possible candidates to enter clinical evaluation and testing.","Tripathy, Satyajit; Dassarma, Barsha; Roy, Somenath; Chabalala, Hlupheka; Matsabisa, Motlalepula Gilbert",Int J Antimicrob Agents,148,5

However, population mobility differs across locations, which could reduce the effectiveness of pandemic control measures. Here we assess the extent to which socioeconomic factors are associated with reductions in population mobility during the COVID-19 pandemic, at both the city level in China and at the country level worldwide. METHODS: In this retrospective, observational study, we obtained anonymised daily mobile phone location data for 358 Chinese cities from Baidu, and for 121 countries from Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports. We assessed the intra-city movement intensity, inflow intensity, and outflow intensity of each Chinese city between Jan 25 (when the national emergency response was implemented) and Feb 18, 2020 (when population mobility was lowest) and compared these data to the corresponding lunar calendar period from the previous year (Feb 5 to March 1, 2019). Chinese cities were classified into four socioeconomic index (SEI) groups (high SEI, high-middle SEI, middle SEI, and low SEI) and the association between socioeconomic factors and changes in population mobility were assessed using univariate and multivariable linear regression. At the country level, we compared six types of mobility (residential, transit stations, workplaces, retail and recreation, parks, and groceries and pharmacies) 35 days after the implementation of the national emergency response in each country and compared these to data from the same day of the week in the baseline period (Jan 3 to Feb 6, 2020). We assessed associations between changes in the six types of mobility and the country's sociodemographic index using univariate and multivariable linear regression. FINDINGS: The reduction in intra-city movement intensity in China was stronger in cities with a higher SEI than in those with a lower SEI (r=-0·47, p<0·0001). However, reductions in inter-city movement flow (both inflow and outflow intensity) were not associated with SEI and were only associated with government control measures. In the country-level analysis, countries with higher sociodemographic and Universal Health Coverage indexes had greater reductions in population mobility (ie, in transit stations, workplaces, and retail and recreation) following national emergency declarations than those with lower sociodemographic and Universal Health Coverage indexes. A higher sociodemographic index showed a greater reduction in mobility in transit stations (r=-0·27, p=0·0028), workplaces (r=-0·34, p=0·0002), and areas retail and recreation (rxs=-0·30, p=0·0012) than those with a lower sociodemographic index. INTERPRETATION: Although COVID-19 outbreaks are more frequently reported in larger cities, our analysis shows that future policies should prioritise the reduction of risks in areas with a low socioeconomic level-eg, by providing financial assistance and improving public health messaging. However, our study design only allows us to assess associations, and a long-term study is needed to decipher causality.

Proteins from our own innate immune system can serve as ideal sources of novel drug candidates thanks to their safety and immune regulation versatility. Some host defense RNases equipped with antiviral activity have been reported over time. Here, we try to summarize the currently available information on human RNases that can target viral pathogens, with special focus on enveloped single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses. Overall, host RNases can fight viruses by a combined multifaceted strategy, including the enzymatic target of the viral genome, recognition of virus unique patterns, immune modulation, control of stress granule formation, and induction of autophagy/apoptosis pathways. The review also includes a detailed description of representative enveloped ssRNA viruses and their strategies to interact with the host and evade immune recognition. For comparative purposes, we also provide an exhaustive revision of the currently approved or experimental antiviral drugs. Finally, we sum up the current perspectives of drug development to achieve successful eradication of viral infections.","Li, Jiarui; Boix, Ester",Virulence,148,20

OBJECTIVE: We assessed the frequency of a fever &#8805;100.4°F and other symptoms associated with COVID-19 among patients in the emergency department (ED) who were tested in the ED for the illness. METHODS: This is a retrospective review of data from patients who were tested for acute COVID-19 infection from March 10, 2020 through June 30, 2020 at two EDs within the same health care system. Data collected included temperature, the presence or recent history of COVID-19-related symptoms, and COVID-19 test results. Descriptive statistics are reported for presenting fever and other COVID-19-related symptoms alone and in combination with presenting fever. RESULTS: A total of 6894 patients were tested for COVID-19. Among these, 330 (4.8%) tested positive for active infection. Of these patients, 64 (19.4%) presented with a fever &#8805;100.4°F (&#8805;38.0°C). Increasing the number of COVID-19-related symptoms in combination with a presenting fever &#8805;100.4°F increased the number of people who could be identified as having a COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSIONS: About a quarter of patients who were tested positive for COVID-19 in our ED did not have a fever at presentation &#8805;100.4°F. Using only temperature to screen for COVID-19 in the community setting will likely miss the majority of patients with active disease.","Vilke, Gary M; Brennan, Jesse J; Cronin, Alexandrea O; Castillo, Edward M",J. emerg. med,148,5

It has emerged as a pandemic and has raised questions on the health infrastructure and facilities available as it is required to get a large number of people tested. RT-PCR is the standard diagnostic test being used. But there are several issues with RT-PCR testing like relying only on one approach even when it is getting difficult for most countries to procure the required amount of testing kits, also there have been some cases of false positive results. All these factors definitely call for a search of alternative testing methodologies, so it not reqired to rely on just one approach. Apart from RT-PCR testing, Chest X-rays can be a great tool to know about the status and severity of COVID-19. Once obtaining the chest X-rays of a person a call has to be made on the COVID-19 status and that needs very high accuracy and expertise and again there will be a shortage of the expertise. So, a solution has been proposed to this problem by developing a COVID-19 detection system, which can assist the medical experts regarding the report and then the experts can make a final call. As observed, DeepLearning techniques, especially Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) have proven to be outstanding in medical image classification and analysis, and as our task is similar to medical image classification, CNN is a good choice for our use case. So, we analyzed four different CNN architectures on Chest X-ray for Covid-19 Diagnosis. The models used are pretrained on ImageNet datasets. Transfer Learning has been used to generate results. A comparative study of the results obtained with different architecture reveals that structures based on CNN have great potential for Covid-19 diagnosis and detection. © 2021 IEEE.","Rawat, R.

An accurate understanding of the body's temporal immune response against SARS-CoV-2 is paramount to successful vaccine development and disease progression monitoring. To provide insight into the antibody response against SARS-CoV-2, plasma samples from 181 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients collected at various timepoints post-symptom onset (PSO) were tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies via lateral flow. Additionally, 21 donors were tracked over time to elucidate patient-specific immune responses. We found sustained levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies past 130 days PSO, with 99% positivity observed at 31-60 days PSO. By 61-90 days PSO, the percentage of IgM-/IgG+ results were nearly equal to that of IgM+/IgG+ results, demonstrating a shift in the immune response with a decrease in IgM antibody levels. Results from this study not only provide evidence that the antibody response to COVID-19 can persist for over 4 months, but also demonstrates the ability of Easy Check&#8482; to monitor seroconversion and antibody response of patients. Easy Check was sufficiently sensitive to detect antibodies in patient samples as early as 1-4 days PSO with 86% positivity observed at 5-7 days PSO. Further studies are required to determine the longevity and efficacy of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and whether they are protective against re-infection.","Higgins, Renee L; Rawlings, Stephen A; Case, Jamie; Lee, Florence Y; Chan, Clarence W; Barrick, Bethany; Burger, Zoe C; Yeo, Kiang-Teck J; Marrinucci, Dena",PLoS One,148,16

In this paper, the multi-layer recursive regression is adopted and improved for the regression algorithm with double influence factors, which increases the processing ability of multi class data. Data of import and export trade between China and the United States in the past five years is collected to create the future prediction model when the epidemic does not occur. Meanwhile, the data of four months after the outbreak to calculate the condition of the future prediction model of the epidemic situation in COVID-19. Using two opposite conditions as different data of regression algorithm calculation, different prediction algorithm formulas are obtained. After multiple calculations, the average value increases the sensitivity of the model. The calculation results show that the improved recursive regression algorithm has higher stability and sensitivity.","Liu, Yang",Journal of Physics: Conference Series,148,21

Methods: Patients with a positive diagnosis of COVID-19 and OD were prospectively recruited from March 22 to December 15, 2020 from 4 European hospitals. Patients had confirmed OD on psychophysical testing. All patients undertook OT, with add-on 10 days of OC (group 1: OC + OT), or 1 month of NC (group 2: NC + OT) or olfactory training alone (group 3: OT). Olfactory evaluations (Sniffin’Sticks tests) were carried out at the time of inclusion, 1 and 2 months after the start of the therapeutic course. Results: A total of 152 hyposmic or anosmic patients completed the study. Group 1, 2 and 3 included 59, 22 and 71 patients, respectively and all patient groups were comparable regarding baseline Sniffin’Sticks tests. The median Sniffin’Sticks test values significantly improved from pre- to post-intervention in all groups. The increase of Sniffin’Sticks test values was higher in group 1 (OC + OT) compared with groups 2 and 3 (p &lt;0.001) at one month after treatment but did not remain so at 2 months. Groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively, presented parosmia in 20/71 (28.2%), 9/22 (40.9%) and 42/71 (59.2%) patients. This difference was statistically significant between group 1 and 3 (p &lt;0.001). There were no patients with a worsening of the disease or an increase of the severity of the COVID-19 symptoms. Conclusions: The use of OCs in patients with OD related to mild COVID-19 is generally well-tolerated without any case of deterioration of symptoms. OC is associated with greater improvement in psychophysical olfactory evaluations at 1-month post-treatment but there was no difference at 2 months. Parosmia may be reduced following treatment with OC and NC. On the basis of these preliminary results, it is possible to state that considering the 2 months efficacy of OC and NC with respect to the OT alone and the risk-benefit ratio, the benefit to start a specific treatment of COVID-19 related OD cannot be demonstrated and there is a need for a randomised controlled trial to assess this further.","Saussez, Sven Vaira Luigi Angelo Chiesa-Estomba Carlos M.; Bon, Serge-D.

However, we argue that in many other cases PPPs are liable to undermine public healthcare and inclusionary claims. This view is informed by the fundamentally different concepts of healthcare that underlie PPPs and public healthcare provision (namely, health care as a commodity vs. access to healthcare as a right) and existing evidence on PPPs' role in facilitating welfare retrenchment. In contexts that are dominated by an exclusionary stance toward irregular migrants, such as contemporary Israel, we believe that PPPs will become stopgaps that undermine health rights, rather than a first foot in the door that leads toward equitable provision of healthcare for all.","Gottlieb, Nora; Filc, Dani; Davidovitch, Nadav",Isr J Health Policy Res,148,16

This article aims at proposing guidance to ensure mental health care during the SARS-CoV epidemy in France. METHODS: Authors performed a narrative review identifying relevant results in the scientific and medical literature and local initiatives in France. RESULTS: We identified four types of major vulnerabilities in patients suffering from mental disorders during this pandemic: (1) medical comorbidities that are more frequently found in patients suffering from mental disorders (cardiovascular and pulmonary pathologies, diabetes, obesity, etc.) which represent risk factors for severe infections with Covid-19; (2) age (the elderly constituting the population most vulnerable to coronavirus); (3) cognitive and behavioral troubles which can hamper compliance with confinement and hygiene measures and finally and (4) psychosocial vulnerability due to stigmatization and/or socio-economic difficulties. Furthermore, the mental health healthcare system is more vulnerable than other healthcare systems. Current government plans are poorly adapted to psychiatric establishments in a context of major shortage of organizational, material and human resources. In addition, a certain number of structural aspects make the psychiatric institution particularly vulnerable: many beds are closed, wards have a high density of patients, mental health community facilities are closed, medical teams are understaffed and poorly trained to face infectious diseases. We could also face major issues in referring patients with acute mental disorders to intensive care units. To maintain continuity of psychiatric care in this pandemic situation, several directions can be considered, in particular with the creation of Covid+ units. These units are under the dual supervision of a psychiatrist and of an internist/infectious disease specialist; all new entrants should be placed in quarantine for 14 days; the nurse staff should benefit from specific training, from daily medical check-ups and from close psychological support. Family visits would be prohibited and replaced by videoconference. At the end of hospitalization, in particular for the population of patients in compulsory ambulatory care situations, specific case-management should be organized with the possibility of home visits, in order to support them when they get back home and to help them to cope with the experience of confinement, which is at risk to induce recurrences of mental disorders. The total or partial closure of mental health community facilities is particularly disturbing for patients but a regular follow-up is possible with telemedicine and should include the monitoring of the suicide risk and psychoeducation strategies; developing support platforms could also be very helpful in this context. Private psychiatrists have also a crucial role of information with their patients on confinement and barrier measures, but also on measures to prevent the psychological risks inherent to confinement: maintenance of sleep regularity, physical exercise, social interactions, stress management and coping strategies, prevention of addictions, etc. They should also be trained to prevent, detect and treat early warning symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, because their prevalence was high in the regions of China most affected by the pandemic. DISCUSSION: French mental healthcare is now in a great and urgent need for reorganization and must also prepare in the coming days and weeks to face an epidemic of emotional disorders due to the containment of the general population.","Chevance, A; Gourion, D; Hoertel, N; Llorca, P-M; Thomas, P; Bocher, R; Moro, M-R; Laprévote, V; Benyamina, A; Fossati, P; Masson, M; Leaune, E; Leboyer, M; Gaillard, R",Encephale,148,30

Healthy pregnant women are still not regarded as a susceptible group despite physiological changes that make pregnant women more vulnerable to severe infection. However, high-risk pregnancies may be associated with severe COVID-19 disease with respiratory failure, as outlined in this report. We discuss the importance of timely delivery and antenatal steroid administration in a critically ill patient. Case: A 27-year-old pregnant woman (gravida 2, para 1) with type I diabetes, morbid obesity, hypothyroidism and a previous Caesarean section presented with critical respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 at 32 weeks of gestation. A preterm emergency Caesarean section was performed, after steroid treatment for foetal lung maturation. The patient benefited from prone positioning; however, transient acute renal injury, rhabdomyolysis and sepsis led to prolonged intensive care and mechanical ventilation for 30 days. The baby had an uncomplicated recovery. Conclusion: COVID-19 infection in high-risk pregnancies may result in severe maternal and neonatal outcomes such as critical respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and premature termination of the pregnancy. Antenatal steroids may be of benefit for foetal lung maturation but should not delay delivery in severe cases.","Kolkova, Zuzana; Bjurström, Martin F.; Länsberg, John-Kalle; Svedas, Eimantas; Hamer, Maria Andrada; Hansson, Stefan R.; Herbst, Andreas; Zaigham, Mehreen",Case Rep.

We demonstrate here that heterotypic cell-in-cell structures with lymphocytes inside multinucleate syncytia are prevalent in the lung tissues of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. These unique cellular structures are a direct result of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein is sufficient to induce a rapid (~45.1 nm/s) membrane fusion to produce syncytium, which could readily internalize multiple lines of lymphocytes to form typical cell-in-cell structures, remarkably leading to the death of internalized cells. This membrane fusion is dictated by a bi-arginine motif within the polybasic S1/S2 cleavage site, which is frequently present in the surface glycoprotein of most highly contagious viruses. Moreover, candidate anti-viral drugs could efficiently inhibit spike glycoprotein processing, membrane fusion, and cell-in-cell formation. Together, we delineate a molecular and cellular rationale for SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and identify novel targets for COVID-19 therapy.","Zhang, Zhengrong; Zheng, You; Niu, Zubiao; Zhang, Bo; Wang, Chenxi; Yao, Xiaohong; Peng, Haoran; Franca, Del Nonno; Wang, Yunyun; Zhu, Yichao; Su, Yan; Tang, Meng; Jiang, Xiaoyi; Ren, He; He, Meifang; Wang, Yuqi; Gao, Lihua; Zhao, Ping; Shi, Hanping; Chen, Zhaolie; Wang, Xiaoning; Piacentini, Mauro; Bian, Xiuwu; Melino, Gerry; Liu, Liang; Huang, Hongyan; Sun, Qiang",Cell death differ,148,20

The emergence of multidrug-resistant and, since 2016, of extensively drug-resistant cases is a continuous challenge for health care workers. The COVID-19 pandemic is making management more difficult. METHODOLOGY: In the present study, a total of 52 confirmed cases of typhoid have been studied during 2019. Detailed clinical features, complications and, lab findings were studied. Typhoid culture and sensitivity were recorded and patients were treated accordingly. Patients were asked about risk factors to aim at informing prevention. RESULTS: Out of the 52 having blood culture positive for Salmonella Typhi 47 (90.4%) and Salmonella Paratyphi 5 (9.6%), 4 (7.7%) were sensitive to first-line (Non-resistant), 11 (21.2%) MDR and 37 (71.2%) patient were XDR. One case was resistant to azithromycin. Nausea, vomiting or, abdominal pain was present in 12 (23%), abdominal distension present in 9 (17.3%), abdominal tenderness in 8 (15.4%), hepatomegaly in 10 (19.2%) and, splenomegaly in 22 (42.3%).There were ultrasound abnormalities in 58% of patients and GI complications in 19% of patients. No significant difference was found in clinical findings and complications between resistant and non-resistant cases. Only 23-27% of patients were aware of typhoid prevention and vaccination measures. CONCLUSIONS: The increasing prevalence of resistance and higher degree of complications seen in typhoid fever raises the concern further about prevention and effective infection management in the community as well as clinical settings. Moreover, judicial use of antibiotics is much needed in developing countries like Pakistan.","Fida, Samina; Mansoor, Hala; Saif, Saba; Iqbal, Javed; Khan, Arif Qayyum",J Infect Dev Ctries,148,20

The ability to generate viral particles pseudotyped with SARS-COV-2 Spike is useful for many types of studies, such as characterization of neutralizing antibodies or development of fusion-inhibiting small molecules. Here, we characterized the use of a codon-optimized SARS-COV-2 Spike glycoprotein for the generation of pseudotyped HIV-1, murine leukemia virus (MLV), and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) particles. The full-length Spike protein functioned inefficiently with all three systems but was enhanced over 10-fold by deleting the last 19 amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail. Infection of 293FT target cells was possible only if the cells were engineered to stably express the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, but stably introducing an additional copy of this receptor did not further enhance susceptibility. Stable introduction of the Spike-activating protease TMPRSS2 further enhanced susceptibility to infection by 5- to 10-fold. Replacement of the signal peptide of the Spike protein with an optimal signal peptide did not enhance or reduce infectious particle production. However, modifications D614G and R682Q further enhanced infectious particle production. With all enhancing elements combined, the titer of pseudotyped HIV-1 particles reached almost 106 infectious particles/ml. Finally, HIV-1 particles pseudotyped with SARS-COV-2 Spike were successfully used to detect neutralizing antibodies in plasma from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, but not in plasma from uninfected individuals.IMPORTANCE In work with pathogenic viruses, it is useful to have rapid quantitative tests for viral infectivity that can be performed without strict biocontainment restrictions. A common way of accomplishing this is to generate viral pseudoparticles that contain the surface glycoprotein from the pathogenic virus incorporated into a replication-defective viral particle that contains a sensitive reporter system. These pseudoparticles enter cells using the glycoprotein from the pathogenic virus, leading to a readout for infection. Conditions that block entry of the pathogenic virus, such as neutralizing antibodies, will also block entry of the viral pseudoparticles. However, viral glycoproteins often are not readily suited for generating pseudoparticles. Here, we describe a series of modifications that result in the production of relatively high-titer SARS-COV-2 pseudoparticles that are suitable for the detection of neutralizing antibodies from COVID-19 patients.","Johnson, Marc C; Lyddon, Terri D; Suarez, Reinier; Salcedo, Braxton; LePique, Mary; Graham, Maddie; Ricana, Clifton; Robinson, Carolyn; Ritter, Detlef G",J. virol,148,5

Elderly-onset RA can be assumed as a benign form of RA. Until recently, face-to-face therapeutic sessions between health professionals and patients are usually the method of its treatment. However, during pandemics, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), teletherapeutic sessions can extensively increase the patient safety especially in elderly patients who are more vulnerable to these infections. Thus, the aim of this randomized clinical trial was to evaluate a novel teletherapy approach for management of elderly patients suffering from RA by utilizing laser acupuncture. METHODS: A teletherapy system was used for management of elderly patients suffering from RA. Sixty participants were allocated randomly into two groups and the ratio was 1:1. Patients in the first group were treated with laser acupuncture and telerehabilitation sessions, which consisted of aerobic exercise and virtual reality training. Patients in the second group received telerehabilitation sessions, which consisted of aerobic exercise and virtual reality training. Evaluation of patients was done by using the Health Assessment questionnaire (HAQ), the Rheumatoid Arthritis Quality of Life (RAQoL) questionnaire, and the analysis of interleukin-6 (IL-6), serum C-reactive protein (CRP), plasma adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentration and plasma malondialdehyde (MDA). RESULTS: A statistically significant difference was found in CRP, RAQoL, IL-6 and MDA between the pre- and post-treatments in the first group (p < 0.05) favouring the post-treatment group, while the HAQ showed a statistically significant difference between pre- and post-treatments (p < 0.05) in both groups. Statistically significant post-treatment differences were also observed between the two groups (p < 0.05) in RAQoL, CRP, ATP and MDA, favouring the first group. DISCUSSION: Laser acupuncture teletherapy could be suggested as a reliable treatment method for elderly patients suffering from RA, as it can provide a safe and effective therapeutic approach. Teletherapy provided safer access to health professionals and patients while giving a high patient satisfaction value with a relatively lower cost (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04684693).","Adly, Aya Sedky; Adly, Afnan Sedky; Adly, Mahmoud Sedky; Ali, Mohammad F",J Telemed Telecare,148,1

Immune serum from vaccinated subjects seems (largely) to retain titres of neutralizing antibodies, even against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) VOC 202012/01-lineage B.1.1.7. Here, we describe an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 infection in three HCWs in a hospital setting; two of the HCWs were fully vaccinated (i.e. had received two doses). METHODS: Two physicians and one nurse working on the same shift on 20th February 2021 were involved in the outbreak. Real-time PCR, antigen tests, and serological tests for the IgG anti-spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 were performed, along with whole-genome sequencing (WGS). RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed in all three HCWs; all presented with mild symptoms of COVID-19. The two physicians were fully vaccinated with BNT162b2 vaccine, with the second dose administered 1 month before symptom onset. Both had high titres of IgG anti-spike antibodies at the time of diagnosis. WGS confirmed that all virus strains were VOC 202012/01-lineage B.1.1.7, suggesting a common source of exposure. Epidemiological investigation revealed that the suspected source was a SARS-CoV-2-positive patient who required endotracheal intubation due to severe COVID-19. All procedures were carried out using a full suite of personal protective equipment (PPE). CONCLUSIONS: This mini-outbreak highlights some important issues about the efficacy of vaccines against transmission of SARS-CoV-2 variants, the high risk of exposure among HCWs, and the need for optimized implementation of PPE in hospitals. The wide circulation of VOC 202012/01 in Europe and Italy highlights the need to improve surveillance and genetic sequencing.","Loconsole, Daniela; Sallustio, Anna; Accogli, Marisa; Leaci, Angela; Sanguedolce, Antonio; Parisi, Antonio; Chironna, Maria",Clin. microbiol. infect,148,33

Both behavioral disturbances in bvFTD and cognitive impairment in AD contribute to caregiver burden. Objective: To investigate the impact of home confinement during the COVID-19 crisis on the burden of caregivers of bvFTD or AD patients. Methods: During the COVID-19 lockdown in France, neurologists and neuropsychologists from the Memory Center of Nantes Hospital conducted teleconsultations for 38 AD patients and 38 bvFTD patients as well as for their caregivers. During these consultations, caregivers were invited to rate the change in their burden during home confinement. They were also invited to rate behavioral or emotional changes in the patients during, compared with before, the confinement. Results: Twenty-two bvFTD caregivers and 14 AD caregivers experienced an increase in burden. For bvFTD caregivers, this increased burden occurred regardless of behavioral changes, while AD caregivers experienced an increased burden related to changes in patients’ neuropsychiatric symptoms. Among the whole cohort, 2 factors were associated with increased caregiver burden: behavioral change and bvFTD. Conclusion: The results demonstrate that during home confinement in the COVID-19 crisis, neuropsychiatric symptoms were the core factor that impacted caregiver burden in different ways depending on the disease.","Boutoleau-Bretonnière, Claire Pouclet-Courtemanche Hélène Gillet Aurélie Bernard Amélie Deruet Anne-Laure Gouraud Inès Lamy Estelle Mazoué Aurélien Rocher Laëtitia Bretonnière Cédric Mohamad El Haj",Dementia and Geriatric Cognitive Disorders Extra,148,1

In this COVID pandemic, the decision to continue elective cancer surgeries, and their subsequent outcomes, are sparsely reported from hotspots. METHODS: A prospective database of the Department of Surgical Oncology was analysed from March 23rd to April 30th, 2020. FINDINGS: Four hundred ninety-four elective surgeries were performed (377 untested and 117 tested for Covid 19 before surgery). Median age was 48 years with 13% (n = 64) above the age of 60 years. Sixty-eight percent patients were American Society of Anaesthesiology (ASA) grade I.

The palliative care consult service at Bellevue Hospital, therefore, adjusted rapidly to meet the increased needs of our patients and colleagues. Objectives: To describe the dynamic palliative care needs during a public hospital's COVID-19 surge, including a process to utilize nonpalliative care trained volunteers to meet the increased demand for inpatient palliative care consults. Confronting the Challenge: Given the flexibility needed during the surge response, the consult team focused on three key elements to meet the system's needs: surge staffing, support, and scale. The consult service expanded into three individual teams to accommodate daily rounds with the medical intensive care and general medicine teams. Nonpalliative care trained community volunteers and internally redeployed providers received targeted training in advanced care planning and were subsequently embedded within the three teams, each led by a palliative care provider. A total of 12 volunteers joined the palliative care team. During eight weeks of the surge, the service cared for a total of 276 patients, 111 of whom were seen by volunteers. Over 50% of the palliative care patients had limited English proficiency. Conclusion: The inpatient palliative care consult service structure adapted rapidly in response to the increased need for advanced care planning and support throughout the hospital during the COVID-19 surge. Focusing on three key areas of surge staffing, support, and scale resulted in expert coordination with the hospital and system level leadership, efficient training of volunteer providers, and frequent re-evaluation of response strategies. These elements were vital in allowing the palliative care team to harness the expertise of various volunteer providers to meet the increased demands of a safety net hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Xu, Yijie; Zhang, Luyi K; Smeltz, Robert L; Cohen, Susan E",J. palliat. med,148,25

Within the field of orthopaedic surgery, it is a common sight to see orthopaedic surgery carried out in ""space suits"" (SS) which comprise of a helmet, hood and surgical gown. In this study the authors made modifications to two different SS systems to incorporate high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters to the inlets to the fan to assess their potential as a method of providing a reusable system for PPE for the surgeon with regard to protection from a respiratory droplet spread virus. The testing was carried out using particle counter upstream and downstream on a manikin wearing two different SS systems with and without modifications to the inlet. The results show that using a layer of HEPA filter cut to size, and sealed to the inlet for the fan in the helmet will reduce the downstream particulate at the user's mouth by over 99.5% which is equivalent to that of a respirator mask. HEPA filter material is relatively cheap and can be used repeatedly making this a viable alternative to disposable, and even re-sterilized, respirator masks in the setting of a respiratory droplet spread viral pandemic.","Gibbons, John P; Hayes, Joshua; Skerritt, Conor J; O039,; Byrne, John M; Green, Connor J",J. hosp. infect,148,16

Phagocytosing human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (hPMN) undergo accelerated apoptosis, a process referred to as phagocytosis-induced cell death (PICD) and an early step in their clearance from inflammatory sites. Among human pathogens that modulate hPMN apoptosis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae delays PICD, which may contribute to the exuberant neutrophilic inflammation that characterizes gonorrhea. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying delayed PICD, we compared features of hPMN cell death that followed phagocytosis of N. gonorrhoeae FA1090 wild-type (GC) or serum-opsonized zymosan (OPZ), a prototypical stimulus of PICD. Phosphatidylserine externalization required NADPH oxidase activity after ingestion of GC or OPZ, and annexin V staining and DNA fragmentation were less after phagocytosis of GC compared to OPZ. Caspase 3/7 and caspase 9 activities after phagocytosis of GC were less than that seen after ingestion of OPZ, but caspase 8 activity was the same after ingestion of GC or OPZ. When hPMN sequentially ingested GC followed by OPZ, both caspase 3/7 and 9 activities were less than that seen after OPZ alone, and the inhibition was dose dependent for GC, suggesting that ingestion of GC actively inhibited PICD. Sequential phagocytosis did not block caspase 8 activity, mitochondrial depolarization, or annexin V/propidium iodide staining compared to responses of hPMN fed OPZ alone, despite inhibition of caspases 3/7 and 9. Taken together, these data suggest that active inhibition of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis contributes to the delay in PICD after hPMN ingestion of N. gonorrhoeae.","Cho, Christine; Teghanemt, Athmane; Apicella, Michael A; Nauseef, William M","J. leukoc. biol., suppl",148,16

With high mortality and limited capacity;appropriate decisions to escalate to critical care were vital for just resource allocation but also to prevent harm where interventions would not change outcomes. NICE guidance highlighted Clinical frailty scoring (CFS) as central to the decision-making process. 1, Despite initial criticism, recent evidence has confirmed increasing CFS as an independent risk factor to inpatient mortality in COVID-19.2 We conducted a quality improvement project with the aim of improving CFS documentation at the Royal Free Hospital. Methods We reviewed the notes of 71 inpatients over the age of 65 years from 6 wards on 08/05/20–12/05/20 for both a CFS score documentation and clear treatment escalation plan at time points of initial clerking, post-take and following ward admission with an audit standard of 100%. We developed teaching sessions, promoted the CFS mobile application, developed a post-take sticker and an elderly medicine ward admission proforma. We re-audited 66 inpatient notes from the same 6 wards from 25/06/20–07/07/20. Results Documentation.of CFS improved from 7% to 17% for clerking and post-take and from 13% to 24% on the ward admission. The number of patients with treatment escalation plans was 50%. Conclusion CFS is crucial for the COVID-19 era and beyond. We have demonstrated that increased awareness improves use of CFS, though it is not yet being widely used in escalation decisions. 1.

We evaluated surrogate markers of chronic urinary symptoms to determine if they were more frequent after COVID-19 infection. METHODS: Routinely collected data from the province of Ontario was used to conduct a matched, retrospective cohort study. We identified patients 66 years of age or older who had a positive COVID-19 test between February and May 2020 and survived at least 2 months after their diagnosis. We matched them to two similar patients who did not have a positive COVID-19 test during the same time period. We measured the frequency of urology consultation, cystoscopy, and new prescriptions for overactive bladder medications during a subsequent 3-month period. Proportional hazard models were adjusted for any baseline differences between the groups. RESULTS: We matched 5617 patients with COVID-19 to 11,225 people who did not have COVID-19. The groups were similar, aside from a higher proportion of patients having hypertension and diabetes in the CoVID-19 cohort. There was no significantly increased hazard of new receipt of overactive bladder medication (hazards ratio [HR]: 1.04, p = 0.88), urology consultation (HR: 1.40, p = 0.10), or cystoscopy (HR: 1.14, p = 0.50) among patients who had COVID-19, compared to the matched cohort. CONCLUSION: Surrogate markers of potential bladder dysfunction were not significantly increased in the 2-5 months after COVID-19 infection.","Welk, Blayne; Richard, Lucie; Braschi, Emmanuel; Averbeck, Marcio A",Neurourol Urodyn,148,13

METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, charts of 52 eyes of 26 consecutive infants were reviewed. The patients received 0.0125 mL (Group 1) or 0.025 mL (Group 2) anti-VEGF agents' intravitreally. The IOP was measured before injection, on the first day, during the first week, and in the first month. After each injection, optic nerve head perfusion was evaluated by a binocular indirect ophthalmoscope. IOP values, complications, use of antiglaucomatous drops, and the effects of anti-VEGF drugs were recorded. RESULTS: The mean baseline IOP before injection was 16.0 ± 3.7 mmHg for Group 1 and 15.5 ± 4.5 mmHg for Group 2 (p = 0.365). The mean value of IOP on the first day was statistically increased in Group 2 (29.2 ± 6.1 mmHg) compared with Group 1 (24.1 ± 6.8 mmHg) (p = 0.013). Moreover, antiglaucomatous drops were needed in 12 eyes for Group 2 compared with seven eyes for Group 1. Anterior chamber paracentesis was not performed after any of the injections. CONCLUSION: This study found that IOP increases after intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF agents for the treatment of ROP. The injection of 0.025 mL anti-VEGF agents increases IOP more than the 0.0125 mL injection in the treatment of infants with aggressive posterior ROP.","Ozdemir, Ozdemir; Arman, Aysegul; Tayman, Cuneyt",Graefes arch. clin. exp. ophthalmol,148,2

SARS-CoV2 infects people of any age, the elderly and the eople who already have medical conditions (like the diabetes and heart diseases) are at high risksto get severe illnessby this virus. Due to the lack of preliminary studies on the risk of infection of infected persons with chronic diseases with covid-19 in France, due to the large number of infections in the region, the paper aim to identify or diagnose the SARS-CoV2-19 virus and how it spreads in France .and its effect on the health of infected persons with chronic diseases and provide Health and preventative instructions for them to reduce their risk of infection. The mainobjective of the surveillance at this time has been supporting the worldwide strategy to contain SARS-CoV2 with the fast identifications and follow-up of the cases that are linked to the affected countries for the purpose of minimizingthe onward transmissions,ACE-2 is one of the known peptidases,it has the task of regulatingRAAS (i.e. renin-angioten-aldosterone system), thereby, it controls the pressure of blood. Which is why,it is no surprise that the initial reports have been suggesting that diabetes,hypertension and CVDshave been the most widespreadfactors of comorbidity in the SARS-CoV-2. This global pandemic produced a massiveamount of the literature on risk factors worsening clinical events that are related to this virus. In fact, not all the patients undergo this disease with equal degrees of severity, and some of them are evenasymptomatic. Diabetes rapidly became a potential factor of risk, COVID-19 Diabetic patients are under higher risksto develop severe pneumonia and get noticeable pro-thrombotic and pro-inflammatory states, in comparison with the infected individuals who do not have diabetes. In addition to that, they had as well considerably higher rates of mortality 7.80% vs. 2.70% in addition to a higherrates of multiple organ injuries. We conclude from that after the World Health Organization declared this disease a pandemic .. and there is no age category excluded from infection, as it affects young and old equally, especially the elderly, especially people with chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease more exposed to infection. © 2020 Global Research Online.

Healing from COVID-19 infection, defined as two consecutive negative swabs, was reported in 544 patients (22.2%), 95% of them were hospitalized. RESULTS: Age and Charlson Comorbidity Index were significantly lower in healing compared with nonhealing patients (63â±â15 vs. 69â±â15 and 2â±â2 vs. 3â±â2, both Pâ<â0.05). In multivariable regression model, predictors of healing were younger age (OR: 0.99; 95% CI 0.98-0.99, Pâ=â0.0001), absence of chronic kidney disease (OR: 0.35; 95% CI 0.17-0.70, Pâ=â0.003) or heart failure (OR: 0.44; 95% CI, 0.28-0.70, Pâ=â0.001). In the subgroup of patients suffering from hypertension and/or heart failure (nâ=â1498), no differences were observed in the use of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that younger age and absence of comorbidities play a major role in determining healing in patients with COVID-19. No effects of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers on the outcome was reported.","Mancusi, Costantino; Grassi, Guido; Borghi, Claudio; Carugo, Stefano; Fallo, Francesco; Ferri, Claudio; Giannattasio, Cristina; Grassi, Davide; Letizia, Claudio; Minuz, Pietro; Muiesan, Maria Lorenza; Perlini, Stefano; Pucci, Giacomo; Rizzoni, Damiano; Salvetti, Massimo; Sarzani, Riccardo; Sechi, Leonardo; Veglio, Franco; Volpe, Massimo; Iaccarino, Guido",J. hypertens,148,1

(2) Is there a difference in pain, hand function, anxiety, depression, and illness perception between patients in the COVID-19 period group and patients in the reference period group? METHODS: This study was part of a large cohort study with routine outcome measures of patients with hand and wrist conditions To answer our research questions, we analyzed two samples because not all PROMs were sent to participants at the same time points after treatment The first sample consisted of all participants who completed PROMs on quality of life (QoL), pain, and hand function at their final follow-up time point, which was either 3, 6, or 12 months post-treatment The second sample consisted of participants who completed PROMs 3 months post-treatment on anxiety, depression, and illness perception Each sample consisted of two groups: a COVID-19 period group and a reference period group We included 1613 participants in the first sample (COVID-19 period group: n = 616;reference period group: n = 997) and 535 participants in the second sample (COVID-19 period group: n = 313;reference period group: n = 222) The primary outcome was QoL, expressed in the EuroQol 5-Dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D) index score Secondary outcomes were the other domains on the EQ-5D, as well as pain, hand function, anxiety, depression, and illness perception RESULTS: We found no between-group differences in the EQ-5D index score (standardized mean difference 0 035;p = 0 98) Furthermore, there were no between-group differences in PROM scores for hand function, anxiety, or depression There were, however, a few small differences in subdomain items regarding pain and illness perception, but we believe in aggregate that these are unlikely to make a clinically important difference in our main finding CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic and its associated lockdown had no influence on QoL and had little influence on secondary outcomes in participants who were part of the Hand-Wrist Study Cohort This finding implies that PROMs data collected during this period can be used with confidence in clinical research Our findings indicate that when a pandemic like this occurs again, we can continue to use PROMs for analysis in clinical research or routine outcome measures LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, therapeutic study","Cohen, A.; Selles, R.

And what are the experiences, barriers, successes? Findings: Research-based transformative knowledge, real situations and practical resources for considering inclusive education curriculum concepts were found that are connecting educators, teachers, learners and communities during this time of crisis Research limitations/implications: Methodological limitations that influenced the research design include conducting research in a totally virtual environment, small sample size, lack of diversity in curriculum content and one research site The data collection was limited to written responses from the faculty participants This action research study took place in a time frame limited by COVID-19 conditions during a four-month period Practical implications: In theory and practice, this new online movement suggests learners, teachers, educators and leaders are gaining experience and knowledge about resources and strategies for using new technologies, assessments and flexible curriculum as powerful tools for building language, curriculum and social-cultural communication bonds across generations and including special needs populations Such new and emerging strategies could be used to bridge gaps in a time of distancing to support inclusive and equitable learning environments in education to minimize the effects of an emergent COVID-19 digital divide Social learning culture as constructed, performed and captured in patterns of cooperation among faculties shows the world becoming more open and less restricted by borders In conclusion, an emerging new conceptual framework is presented in Figure 2 to support action planning to bridge the digital equity access and learning gaps created by COVID-19 Social implications: It is in times of strife and difficulty that problems and issues become exacerbated While some educators easily adapted and took on the challenges of online learning, others needed time for learning and mourning (literally and figuratively) The issues of equity and access have become even more apparent as this paper takes inventory of intersections between multicultural education, special education, sports education and K-16 education overall This is an excellent time to reflect on how education can address the cultural, economic and social barriers that impact student learning globally for all learners Originality/value: The brief collective case study reports educational experiences during a time of crisis that stimulates creative and innovative approaches to creating inclusive and equitable online learning environments to address diverse learning needs The various and often contrasting educator responses from faculty facing digital and educational challenges present ideas that might b applicable in the global learning environment beyond the COVID-19 pandemic © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited","Pittman, J.; Severino, L.; DeCarlo-Tecce, M.

However, factors that may confer risks for child routines have seldom been examined, particularly in families where parents and grandparents co-care the children. This study aimed to investigate the associations of parents' and grandparents' depressive symptoms with preschoolers' daily routines in Chinese three-generation families and to determine whether household chaos mediated or moderated the associations. The participants were from 171 urban three-generation families where mothers, fathers, and grandmothers (97 paternal and 74 maternal) were primary caregivers. Mothers, fathers, and grandmothers reported their depressive symptoms at Wave 1; at Wave 2 (during the COVID-19 pandemic), caregivers reported household chaos and child routines. The results revealed that child routines were negatively predicted by parents' joint depressive symptoms rather than grandmothers' depressive symptoms. In the associations, household chaos acted as a mediator rather than a moderator. Specifically, household chaos marginally mediated the associations between parents' and grandmothers' depressive symptoms and child routines only in maternal three-generation families. These findings suggest that in three-generation families, caregivers with more depressive symptoms may elicit more chaotic family environments, which may in turn compromise their children's daily routines.","Jiang, Yongqiang; He, Ting; Lin, Xiuyun; Zhou, Qing; Wu, Qinglu",Curr Psychol,148,1

METHODS: All members of the Vascular and Endovascular Surgery Society were surveyed on the effects of COVID-19 in their practices, educational programs, and self-reported grading of their surgical acuity level using the VASCON scale. RESULTS: Total response rate was 28% (206/731). Most respondents (99.5%) reported an effect of COVID-19 on their practice, and most were VASCON3 or lower level. Most reported a decrease in clinic referrals, inpatient/emergency room consults, and case volume (P < .00001). Twelve percent of respondents have been deployed to provide critical care and 11% medical care for COVID-19 patients. More than one-quarter (28%) face decreased compensation or salary. The majority of respondents feel vascular education is affected; however, most feel graduates will finish with the necessary experiences. There were significant differences in answers in lower VASCON levels respondents, with this group demonstrating a statistically significant decreased operative volume, vascular surgery referrals, and increased hospital and procedure limitations. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly all vascular surgeons studied are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic with decreased clinical and operative volume, educational opportunities for trainees, and compensation issues. The VASCON level may be helpful in determining surgical readiness.","Aziz, Faisal; Bath, Jonathan; Smeds, Matthew R",J Vasc Surg,148,10

Aim: The purpose of the survey we proposed, was to collect information provided directly by medical professionals during the first weeks of the SARS-CoV-2 virus epidemic about how the facilities in which they work. Material and methods: An anonymous survey was addressed to all medical staff and made available on the Internet for a period of 10 days. The research group consisted of 284 people. Results and discussion: Most (97.6%) of health care units have introduced changes in the way they function in connection with a pandemic, and almost every employee was informed about it (94.7%). In most centres, frequent hand disinfection (86.6%) and the wearing of face masks (60.2%) were recommended. Changes in working hours have been introduced in 60.6% cases, and nature of work has changed for 62.0% of respondents. Most respondents are afraid that they may be a source of infection for their relatives (81.3%), whilst almost half are afraid for their personal health (49.3%) and that of their colleagues (54.2%). For the vast majority of respondents, the use of disinfectants has been recommended (94.0%), the wearing of gloves (93.0%), and for 79.9% to wear protective masks. Conclusions: In a survey of medical staff, most people have been experiencing increased stress due to the current coronavirus pandemic. The greatest concern among medics is the possibility of transmitting the SARS-CoV-2 virus to their relatives and colleagues. According to respondents, the current pandemic will have an impact on how the healthcare system will change in Poland.","Kufel-Grabowska, J.; Bartoszkiewicz, M.; Litwiniuk, M.",Polish Annals of Medicine,148,33

We describe our technique for THA via the HAA in hips with Crowe type-IV developmental dysplasia and report the mid-term outcomes of cases that were performed over 5 consecutive years. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated a continuous series of 8 hips (6 patients) with Crowe type-IV dysplasia; the patient ages ranged from 44 ± 20 years (range, 17 to 65 years) at the index THA. All of the patients received uncemented implants via the HAA on a traction table to restore the hip center of rotation to the true acetabulum. Femoral head autografts (FHAs) were used to increase acetabular coverage in 6 hips, and subtrochanteric shortening osteotomies (SSOs) were performed in 5 hips. Patients were assessed clinically and radiographically at a minimum follow-up of 2 years. RESULTS: There were no revisions, deaths, dislocations, or infections. Two hips (25%) had intraoperative complications, and 1 hip (13%) had a postoperative complication that required reoperation without implant removal. All of the hips were assessed clinically and radiographically at 4 ± 1 years (range, 2 to 6 years). The modified Harris hip score (mHHS) improved from 33 ± 7 to 90 ± 7, and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) improved from 53 ± 14 to 89 ± 6; the postoperative leg-length discrepancy was 3.2 mm (range, -10 to 20 mm). None of the hips had osteolysis or radiolucent lines of >2 mm. CONCLUSIONS: THA via the HAA on a traction table for hips with Crowe type-IV dysplasia yielded satisfactory mid-term outcomes. Both FHA and SSO can be adequately performed via the HAA to help restore the hip center of rotation to the true acetabulum. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level IV.

A thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) unit as an electron-deficient unit has been used to construct conjugated polymers for application in fullerene and non-fullerene based OSCs. TPD-based monomers can be simply prepared and TPD-polymers can be synthesized via environmentally friendly direct (hetero)arylation polymerization, providing a possibility for large quantity preparation. TPD-polymers usually have deep frontier energy levels, wide band gaps with absorption onset around 700 nm and good charge transport properties, showing the advantages of high open-circuit voltage, high fill-factor and excellent spectral matching with a small band gap non-fullerene acceptor. From the material design and synthesis and their optoelectrical properties, TPD-polymers have great potential applications in OSCs toward large-area devices. In this review, we provide an overview of TPD-polymers for OSCs in the last ten years, including the design and synthesis of TPD-polymers, and their application in fullerene and non-fullerene OSCs. We will also provide some perspective about the research of TPD-polymers that meet the requirement of OSCs. We hope that our universal summary can stimulate the study of TPD-polymers in the future, especially toward high performance, low cost and stable OSCs.","Zhao, Chaowei; Yang, Fan; Xia, Dongdong; Zhang, Zhou; Zhang, Yuefeng; Yan, Nanfu; You, Shengyong; Li, Weiwei",,148,29

Italy was the first Western country to impose a general lockdown to its citizens. Implications of these measures on several aspects of public health remain unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the lockdown on surgical emergencies volumes and care in a large, tertiary referral center. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Electronic medical records of all patients visited in our Emergency Department (ED) and admitted in a surgical ward from February 21st 2020 to May 3rd 2020 were collected, analyzed and compared with the same periods of 2019 and 2018 and a cross-sectional study was performed. RESULTS: Number of surgical admissions dropped significantly in 2020 with respect to the same periods of 2019 and 2018, by almost 50%. The percentage distribution of admissions in different surgical wards did not change over the three years. Time from triage to operating room significantly reduced in 2020 respect to 2019 and 2018 (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The lockdown in Italy due to SARS-CoV-2 pandemic arguably represents the largest social experiment in modern times. Data provided by our study provide useful information to health authorities and policymakers about the effects of activity restriction on surgical accesses and changing epidemiology due to an exceptional external event.","Rosa, F; Covino, M; Sabia, L; Quero, G; Fiorillo, C; Cozza, V; Sganga, G; Gasbarrini, A; Franceschi, F; Alfieri, S",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,148,16

Serologic tests could be complementary to PCR in these situations. The aim of our study was to analyze the diagnostic performance of one serologic rapid test in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We evaluated a lateral flow immunoassay (AllTest COVID-19 IgG/IgM) which detects IgG and IgM antibodies. We validated the serologic test using serum samples from 100 negative patients (group 1) and 90 patients with COVID-19 confirmed by PCR (group 2). Then, we prospectively evaluated the test in 61 patients with clinical diagnosis of pneumonia of unknown etiology that were negative for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR (group 3). RESULTS: All 100 patients from group 1 were negative for the serologic test (specificity = 100 %). Regarding group 2 (PCR-positive), the median time from their symptom onset until testing was 17 days. For these 90 group-2 patients, the test was positive for either IgM or IgG in 58 (overall sensitivity = 64.4 %), and in patients tested 14 days or more after the onset of symptoms, the sensitivity was 88.0 %. Regarding the 61 group-3 patients, median time after symptom onset was also 17 days, and the test was positive in 54 (88.5 % positivity). CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that Alltest lateral flow immunoassay is reliable as a complement of PCR to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection after 14 days from the onset of symptoms and in patients with pneumonia and negative PCR for SARS-CoV-2.","Pérez-García, Felipe; Pérez-Tanoira, Ramón; Romanyk, Juan; Arroyo, Teresa; Gómez-Herruz, Peña; Cuadros-González, Juan",J Clin Virol,148,24

In this review, we present the uptake of preprint server use in nephrology and discuss specific considerations regarding preprint server use in medicine. Distribution of kidney-related research on preprint servers is rising at an exponential rate. Survey of nephrology journals identified that 15 of 17 (88%) are publishing original research accepted submissions that have been uploaded to preprint servers. After reviewing 52 clinically impactful trials in nephrology discussed in the online Nephrology Journal Club (NephJC), an average lag of 300 days was found between study completion and publication, indicating an opportunity for faster research dissemination. Rapid review of papers discussing benefits and risks of preprint server use from the researcher, publisher, or end user perspective identified 53 papers that met criteria. Potential benefits of biomedical preprint servers included rapid dissemination, improved transparency of the peer review process, greater visibility and recognition, and collaboration. However, these benefits come at the risk of rapid spread of results not yet subjected to the rigors of peer review. Preprint servers shift the burden of critical appraisal to the reader. Media may be especially at risk due to their focus on ""late-breaking"" information. Preprint servers have played an even larger role when late-breaking research results are of special interest, such as during the global coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Coronavirus disease 2019 has brought both the benefits and risks of preprint servers to the forefront. Given the prominent online presence of the nephrology community, it is poised to lead the medicine community in appropriate use of preprint servers.","Vlasschaert, Caitlyn; Giles, Cameron; Hiremath, Swapnil; Lanktree, Matthew B",Clin. j. am. soc. nephrol,148,5

A panel dataset of daily stock market returns is analysed in this study, changes in COVID-19 cases, and government responses to 17 countries in the Pacific and South Asia from 1st January 2020 to 31st December 2020. Findings indicate that social distancing policies have a significant negative effect on stock returns but a substantial positive impact on market growth when new cases' growth rate declines after accounting for country characteristics and systematic risk due to foreign factors. A direct negative effect is seen almost immediately, and a subsequently indirect positive effect is noted. As expected, policies regarding social distancing have an immediate negative impact, attributed mainly to the expected negative effect on economic activity. Subsequently, we see an indirect positive effect on market return because social distancing measures reduced the growth of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Both awareness, containment, and health index (ACHI) and Income Support and Debt Relief Index (ISDRI) positively affect market growth, as they are perceived to support individuals' socio-economic well-being and mainly result in positive market returns. © 2021 The Author(s).

There is a crucial demand for rapid techniques such as antigen detection test. Considering the different diagnostic accuracy of tests with other respiratory viruses in adults and children, SARS-CoV-2 antigen test must be evaluated specifically in children. METHODS: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device (Abbott) as a point-of-care test for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to RT-qPCR in a pediatric population. RESULTS: Four hundred forty nasopharyngeal swabs were tested. Amongst the 18 positive RT-qPCR samples, 14 were detected by the rapid antigen test, given an overall sensitivity of 77.7%. All the samples detected positive with the antigen rapid test were also positive with RT-qPCR. CONCLUSION: The sensitivity of Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device is lower in children than in adults. Nevertheless, considering the good values of specificity, negative and positive predictive values this test could be used as a frontline test to obtain quick results, although the negative values with COVID-19 high clinical suspicion should be confirmed using RT-qPCR.","González-Donapetry, Patricia; García-Clemente, Paloma; Bloise, Iván; García-Sánchez, Consuelo; Sánchez Castellano, Miguel Ángel; Romero, María Pilar; Gutiérrez Arroyo, Almudena; Mingorance, Jesús; de Ceano-Vivas La Calle, María; García-Rodriguez, Julio",Pediatr Infect Dis J,148,16

Digital literacy and resilience are crucial for them to navigate the digital world as much as the real world; however, these remain under-researched subjects, especially in developing countries. In Vietnam, the education system has put considerable effort into teaching students these skills to promote quality education as part of the United Nations-defined Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG4). This issue has proven especially salient amid the COVID??19 pandemic lockdowns, which had obliged most schools to switch to online forms of teaching. This study, which utilizes a dataset of 1061 Vietnamese students taken from the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)'s ""Digital Kids Asia Pacific (DKAP)"" project, employs Bayesian statistics to explore the relationship between the students' background and their digital abilities. Results show that economic status and parents' level of education are positively correlated with digital literacy. Students from urban schools have only a slightly higher level of digital literacy than their rural counterparts, suggesting that school location may not be a defining explanatory element in the variation of digital literacy and resilience among Vietnamese students. Students' digital literacy and, especially resilience, also have associations with their gender. Moreover, as students are digitally literate, they are more likely to be digitally resilient. Following SDG4, i.e., Quality Education, it is advisable for schools, and especially parents, to seriously invest in creating a safe, educational environment to enhance digital literacy among students.","Tran, Trung; Ho, Manh-Toan; Pham, Thanh-Hang; Nguyen, Minh-Hoang; Nguyen, Khanh-Linh P.; Vuong, Thu-Trang; Nguyen, Thanh-Huyen T.; Nguyen, Thanh-Dung; Nguyen, Thi-Linh; Khuc, Quy; La, Viet-Phuong; Vuong, Quan-Hoang",Sustainability,148,6

Prior research has shown high levels of patient satisfaction and comparable quality of care. Video visits have been hypothesized to be one way to reduce burnout among clinicians, but there has been minimal research on physician views of virtual care. We sought to measure family physician experience with video visits at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We identified all faculty and resident physicians at a large academic department of family medicine who had conducted a video visit in the prior month and conducted an anonymous online 12-question survey about their experiences, satisfaction, and barriers with care. RESULTS: Most eligible physicians responded (102/109, 94%), of whom half (52%) reported this was their first month trying a video visit. There was very high satisfaction (91% very or somewhat satisfied). The majority of respondents felt that video visits were shorter (54%) or took the same amount of time (38%) as in-person visits. There was concern that many physicians had experienced a visit in which they felt video was not the appropriate platform given patient concerns. CONCLUSIONS: This study is among the first to assess physician experience with video visits. As the visits are perceived as shorter, they may offer a unique opportunity to address clinician burnout. There was a high level of satisfaction at our institution despite multiple technical challenges.","Gold, Katherine J; Laurie, Anna R; Kinney, Devon R; Harmes, Kathryn M; Serlin, David C",Fam Med,148,16

In this essay, we consider how leadership has been represented during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic in articles published in the business and general press. We show that, while images of heroic leadership are prevalent in this popular discourse - reminding us vividly of the romance of leadership - other elements, such as references to plural and decentred forms of leadership can be seen as also coexisting in this discourse, while not necessarily being explicitly acknowledged. Opting for a plural, relational and processual conception of leadership allows us to reveal these under-recognized elements. This leads us to propose that these elements are not specific to leadership in times of crises, but are always constitutive of leading in practice. We conclude by arguing that renewing understandings of leadership may require that we acknowledge simultaneously the inevitable presence of romance(s) in how we approach this phenomenon as well as its collective and relational accomplishment. Referring, in turn, to the central phenomenon as leading rather than as leadership may help us reach beyond the seductiveness of the romance(s) of leadership to capture its inherent relationality. MAD statement Our exploration of business press articles published early on during the COVID-19 crisis reveals that the traditional heroic model of leadership is still dominant. Yet, we also see signs of plural and decentred conceptions of leadership emerging between the lines. We suggest that changing the way we think and talk about leadership to refer more to the activity of leading may help counterbalance the romance(s) of the heroic leader. Without dismissing the need for figureheads who can help us make sense of difficult situations, we also need to acknowledge that what is done, in leadership, is always collectively done.

Men have higher plasma TAG and impaired TAG clearance compared to women, which may contribute to sex differences in risk of cardiovascular disease. Understanding mechanisms of sex differences in TAG metabolism may yield novel therapeutic targets to prevent cardiovascular disease. Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) is a lipid shuttling protein known for its effects on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. Although mice lack CETP, we previously demonstrated that transgenic CETP expression in female mice alters TAG metabolism. The impact of CETP on TAG metabolism in males, however, is not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that CETP expression increases plasma TAG in males, especially in very-low density lipoprotein (VLDL), by impairing postprandial plasma TAG clearance compared to wild-type (WT) males. Gonadal hormones were required for CETP to impair TAG clearance, suggesting a role for sex hormones for this effect. Testosterone replacement in the setting of gonadectomy was sufficient to restore the effect of CETP on TAG. Lastly, liver androgen receptor (AR) was required for CETP to increase plasma TAG. Thus, expression of CETP in males raises plasma TAG by impairing TAG clearance via testosterone signaling to AR. Further understanding of how CETP and androgen signaling impair TAG clearance may lead to novel approaches to reduce TAG and mitigate risk of cardiovascular disease.","Palmisano, Brian T; Anozie, Uche; Yu, Sophia; Neuman, Joshua C; Zhu, Lin; Edington, Emery M; Luu, Thao; Stafford, John M",Lipids,148,1

METHODS: Among 3 PPE kits (simple, Level D, and Level C), 30 participants conducted the first simulation in their adapted way and the second following enhanced protocols. After donning, participants performed a 1-minute simulation of direct care on a patient simulator covered with fluorescent powder. For tracking contamination routes between doffing processes, fluorescent powder contamination was examined with ultraviolet lamps in the darkened room. RESULTS: Participants were mostly registered nurses (Nâ¯=â¯27, 90%), female (87%), and on average 31.7 years old with 8.5 years of clinical experience. Among 61 total simulations, 32 had at least 1 contamination (52.5%); ""Noticeable"" level (40%) at the ""hands-fingers"" and ""shirt"" body areas were most frequent. For first and second simulations with identical PPE kits, compared to the first with adapted practice, the second with enhanced protocols showed a significant reduction in doffing contamination rates (72.7% vs 22.7%, P = .0009 for both Level C and D; 77.8% vs 27.8%, P = .0027 for Level D). CONCLUSIONS: Our enhanced protocols could significantly reduce contaminations.

However, the magnitude and determinants of MOV in the country are not known. Thus, this study seeks to assess the prevalence and determinants of MOV in the country. South Africa is sub-divided into nine administrative provinces. We used nationally representative data from the 2016 South African Demographic and Health Survey. We considered MOV to have occurred if a child aged 12-23 months old had not taken all scheduled basic vaccine doses despite having any of the following contacts with health services: delivery in a health facility; postnatal clinic visit; receipt of vitamin A; and any child-related treatment at a health facility. Multilevel logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with MOV. The national prevalence of MOV among children aged 12-23 months was 40.1%. Children whose mothers attended facility-based antenatal care were considerably less likely to experience MOV than those whose mothers did not attend antenatal care: odds ratio (OR) 0.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19 to 0.88. Conversely, the independent predictor of an increased MOV among children was residence in either the Gauteng province (OR 2.97, 95% CI 1.29 to 6.81) or Mpumalanga province (OR 2.32, 95%CI 1.04 to 5.18); compared to residence in the Free State province. Our findings suggest a high burden of MOV among children in South Africa and that MOV may be associated with individual and contextual factors. The findings also underscore the need for further exploration of the contextual factors contributing to MOV in South Africa.","Ndwandwe, Duduzile; Nnaji, Chukwudi A; Wiysonge, Charles S",,148,1

The acceptance of digital tools is high, and the need is growing. OBJECTIVE: Young adults (18-40 years) confronted with a cancer diagnosis present unique needs and require special care. They often have a strong affinity and are familiar with modern technology. On that account, we implemented a web-based symptom and quality of life (QoL) assessment to address patients' attitudes and willingness to use mHealth tools. The study also aims to evaluate sociodemographic parameters that could influence patients' opinions. METHODS: A total of 380 young patients aged 18-40 treated with radiotherapy between 2002 and 2017 were included in the trial. We assessed QoL via the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer-Core 30 (EORTC C30) questionnaire and added general questions about mHealth technology. The added questions inquired patients' opinions regarding general aspects, including technical advances in medicine, mobile and app assistance during cancer treatment, data transfer, and app-specific features. The survey was conducted for 12 months. Participation was voluntary and pseudonymized; prior written consent was obtained. RESULTS: We achieved a participation rate of 57.6% (219/380) and a completion rate of 50.2% (110/219). The median age was 33 years (range 18-40). Of all participants, 89.1% (98/110) considered new technologies in medicine as positive; 10.9% (12/110) answered with neutral. Nearly all patients (96.4%, 106/110) stated that they would send further data via a web-based platform. Of all, 96.4% (106/110) considered the provided pseudonymization of their data as safe. We further asked the patients if they would use a mobile app for symptom and QoL assessment similar to the present web-based system: 74.5% (82/110) answered with yes and 25.5% (28/110) said they would not use a mobile app in the future. We tested the willingness to use an app on several sociodemographic parameters, such as age, gender, education, health insurance status, and cancer-related parameters: tumor stage, time since radiation treatment, and treatment intention. None of these parameters correlated with app use in this group of young adults. Patients who were generally positive regarding using an app rated several possible functions of a future app. The 3 most requested features were appointment reminders (89.0%, 73/82), contact overview of all involved clinics and physicians (87%, 71/82), and making an appointment via app (78%, 64/82). CONCLUSIONS: eHealth and mHealth tools should be available as an integrated part of a comprehensive cancer care approach. It provides automated, thorough documentation of health parameters during therapy and follow-up for doctors, medical staff, and tumor patients to optimize treatment. With this study, we could show that young adults are the ideal patient population to use eHealth/mHealth tools. Such tools offer further digital support and improve the patients' need for constant QoL during cancer care.","Vogel, Marco M E; Eitz, Kerstin A; Combs, Stephanie E",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,148,22

This community-based survey assessed self-reported changes in medications including those stopped, started, or if access had been impacted. METHODS: A survey was collected via Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap). The survey was advertised in the community through social media, email lists, websites, and post-cards. Survey responses were collected between 5/21/2020 and 6/24/2020. Variables included demographic characteristics such as age, sex, race, marital status, education, employment, income, and community type. Questions related to medication changes included: ""Have you started any medication due to COVID-19?"", ""Have you stopped any medication due to COVID-19?"" and ""Have you had issues getting your prescription medications?"". Respondents aged 50 years or older were included. RESULTS: There were N = 1397 responses of which 1169 were older adults &#8805;50 years-old. Of these, 1141 responded to the medication changes survey questions and 28 had missing responses and were excluded from the survey sample for this analysis. Among these, 31 (2.7%) reported a medication change included 5 (0.4%) reported stopping a medication, 18 (1.6%) reported starting a medication, and 8 (0.7%) reported trouble obtaining medications. Medications started included mostly vitamins or other supplements including zinc (n = 9), vitamin C (6), and other supplements (3). Among prescription medications, antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications (4) were reported as well as aspirin (1), losartan (1), and low dose naltrexone (1). One respondent reported unidentified homeopathy. There were no significant differences between those with medication changes and those with none. CONCLUSIONS: In this community-based survey sample of over one thousand older adults, only a small percentage (2.7%; n = 31) reported any changes to medications during the pandemic. As essential workers during this crisis, pharmacists have played a critical role in providing medication information and continued access.","Brown, Joshua D; Vouri, Scott M; Manini, Todd M",Res. soc. adm. pharm,148,20

Some studies have identified obesity as a risk factor for severe disease in patients with COVID-19. The purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and its severity in patients who have undergone bariatric surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS: During the lockdown period (until May 2020), we contacted operated patients by phone and social networks (e.g., Facebook) to maintain constant contact with them; in addition, we gave the patients a dedicated phone number at which to call us for emergencies. We produced telemedicine and educational videos for obese and bariatric patients, and we submitted a questionnaire to patients who had undergone bariatric surgery in the past. RESULTS: A total of 2145 patients (313 male; 1832 female) replied to the questionnaire. Mean presurgical BMI: 44.5 ± 6.8 kg/m2. Mean age: 44.0 ± 10.0 year. Mean BMI after surgery: 29.3 ± 5.5 kg/m2 (p < 0.05). From February to May 2020, 8.4% of patients reported that they suffered from at least one symptom among those identified as related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thirteen patients (0.6%) tested positive for COVID-19. Six patients (0.3%) were admitted to the COVID Department, and 2 patients (0.1%) were admitted to the ICU. CONCLUSIONS: Although the reported rates of symptoms and fever were high, only 0.6% of patients tested positive for COVID-19. Among more than 2000 patients who underwent bariatric surgery analyzed in this study, only 0.1% needed ICU admission.","Uccelli, Matteo; Cesana, Giovanni Carlo; De Carli, Stefano Maria; Ciccarese, Francesca; Oldani, Alberto; Zanoni, Adelinda Angela Giulia; Giorgi, Riccardo; Villa, Roberta; Ismail, Ayman; Targa, Simone; D039,; Alessio, Andrea; Cesana, Giancarlo; Mantovani, Lorenzo; Olmi, Stefano",Obes. surg,148,30

by the SARS-CoV-2 virus on the level of interaction between functional systems of organism and pharmacological correction of organism hypoxic states arising in the complicated course of the disease In the present work the methods of mathematical modeling and theory of optimal control of moving objects were used The proposed integrated mathematical model consisted on the mathematical models of functional systems of respiration and blood circulation, thermoregulation, immune response, erythropoesis, and pharmacological correction Individual patient data were taken for this model, and the disturbing effect in the form of viral disease was simulated The reactions of functional respiratory and blood circulatory systems were predicted Partial pressures of respiratory gases in alveolar spaces and their tensions in lung capillaries blood, arterial and mixed venous blood, and tissue fluid were calculated Further the intravenous injection of antihypoxant was simulated and the values of the same parameters were calculated In such a way it was possible to choose the most optimal way of hypoxic state correction for any individual This model is theoretical only for today because the models of respiratory and blood circulation systems were designed for the average person and it does not suppose peculiarities of individual persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 In particular, this concerns the pequliarities of gas exchange in the alveolar space and characteristics of respiratory gases diffusion through the alveolar-capillary and capillary-tissue membranes However, it is one of possible directions for solving the complex tasks related to treatment of the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus In the result of the work the complex of information support for the imitation of viral

Patients with migraine were specifically vulnerable to inadequate medical care. We aimed to investigate the ""real-world"" impact of COVID-19 pandemic on migraine patients, and to identify risk factors for poor outcome. METHODS: We administered an online, self-reported survey that included demographic, migraine-related, COVID-19-specific and overall psychosocial variables between July 15 and July 30, 2020. We recruited a sample of patients with migraine from headache clinic registry and via social media to complete an anonymous survey. Outcomes included demographic variables, change in migraine frequency and severity during the lockdown period, communication with treating physician, compliance to migraine treatment, difficulty in getting medications, medication overuse, symptoms of anxiety and/or depression, sleep and eating habits disturbance, screen time exposure, work during pandemic, use of traditional medicine, effect of Botox injection cancellation, and overall worries and concerns during pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 1018 patients completed the survey. Of the respondents, 859 (84.3%) were females; 733 (71.9%) were aged 20 to 40 years, 630 (61.8%) were married, and 466 (45.7%) reported working during the pandemic. In comparison to pre-pandemic period, 607 respondents (59.6%) reported increase in migraine frequency, 163 (16%) reported decrease in frequency, and 105 (10.3%) transformed to chronic migraine. Severity was reported to increase by 653 (64.1%) respondents. The majority of respondents; 626 (61.5%) did not communicate with their neurologists, 477 (46.9%) reported compliance to treatment, and 597 (58.7%) reported overuse of analgesics. Botox injections cancellation had a negative impact on 150 respondents (66.1%) from those receiving it. Forty-one respondents (4%) were infected with COVID-19; 26 (63.4%) reported worsening of their headaches amid infection period. Sleep disturbance was reported by 794 (78.1%) of respondents, and 809 (79.5%) reported having symptoms of anxiety and/or depression. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: COVID-19 pandemic had an overall negative impact on patients with migraine. Several risk factors for poor outcome were identified. Long-term strategies should be validated and implemented to deliver quality care for patients with migraine, with emphasis on psychosocial well-being.","Al-Hashel, Jasem Y; Ismail, Ismail Ibrahim",J Headache Pain,148,15

NDV-HXP-S is an inactivated egg-based Newcastle disease virus vaccine expressing the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Its being developed in Thailand, Vietnam, and Brazil; herein are initial results from Thailand. MethodsThis phase 1 stage of a randomised, dose-escalation, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1/2 trial was conducted at the Vaccine Trial Centre, Mahidol University (Bangkok). Healthy adults aged 18-59 years, non-pregnant and negative for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were eligible. Participants were block randomised to receive one of six treatments by intramuscular injection twice, 28 days apart: 1 {micro}g{+/-}CpG1018 (a toll-like receptor 9 agonist), 3 {micro}g{+/-}CpG1018, 10 {micro}g, or placebo. Participants and personnel assessing outcomes were masked to treatment. The primary outcomes were solicited and spontaneously reported adverse events (AEs) during 7 and 28 days after each vaccination, respectively. Secondary outcomes were immunogenicity measures (anti-S IgG and pseudotyped virus neutralisation). An interim analysis assessed safety at day 57 in treatment-exposed individuals and immunogenicity through day 43 per protocol. ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04764422). FindingsBetween March 20 and April 23, 2021, 377 individuals were screened and 210 were enrolled (35 per group); all received dose one; five missed dose two. The most common solicited AEs among vaccinees, all predominantly mild, were injection site pain (<63%), fatigue (<35%), headache (<32%), and myalgia (<32%). The proportion reporting a vaccine-related AE ranged from 5{middle dot}7% to 17{middle dot}1% among vaccine groups and was 2{middle dot}9% in controls; there was no vaccine-related serious adverse event. The 10 {micro}g formulations immunogenicity ranked best, followed by 3 {micro}g+CpG1018, 3 {micro}g, 1 {micro}g+CpG1018, and 1 {micro}g formulations. On day 43, the geometric mean concentrations of 50% neutralising antibody ranged from 122{middle dot}23 IU/mL (1 {micro}g, 95% CI 86{middle dot}40-172{middle dot}91) to 474{middle dot}35 IU/mL (10 {micro}g, 95% CI 320{middle dot}90-701{middle dot}19), with 93{middle dot}9% to 100% of vaccine groups attaining a [≥]4-fold increase over baseline. InterpretationNDV-HXP-S had an acceptable safety profile and potent immunogenicity. The 3 {micro}g and 3 {micro}g+CpG1018 formulations advanced to phase 2.

To assess methods of service quality evaluation in setting benchmarks for comparison after the situation stabilized. To consider what proportion could be delayed based on national guidelines and varying vision parameters. Finally, to measure how many patients actually attended. METHOD: A retrospective analysis of data collected from our electronic medical record was performed. Age, sex, reason for injection, visual acuity (VA) for both treated and untreated eyes and number of injections were recorded. The proportion of patients and eyes with &#8805; 70 letters were calculated as an assessment of quality of service provision. The proportion of patients that could be delayed was estimated based on published guidelines and varying the parameters of difference between treated and untreated eyes. Finally, the number of patients who actually attended was recorded. RESULTS: About 3364 eyes (2229 neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), 427 diabetic macular oedema (DMO), 599 retinal vein occlusion (RVO) and 109 other) from 2924 patients were analysed. At the last appointment with injection, 64.4% of patients achieved &#8805; 70 letters in their better-seeing eye. Mean VA of the treated eye was 61.5 letters, and 36.9% achieved &#8805; 70. The mean number of injections was 16, 90% with aflibercept. Of the patients receiving treatment to one eye, 57.6% was receiving treatment to their worse seeing eye. In 18.2% this eye was > 20 letters worse and in 5.07% > 40 letters worse than the untreated eye. Using Royal College of Ophthalmologists (RCOphth) guidelines, (treat nAMD 8 weekly, delay majority of RVO and DMO) 24.8% would be delayed. From 2738 appointments during the first 4 weeks of lockdown (booked prior to lockdown), doctors rescheduled 1025 and patients did not attend 820, leaving 893 who were seen (33%). CONCLUSIONS: Assessing the treatment position of patients prior to COVID-19 lockdown enables objective stratification for prioritization for continued treatment. If RCOphth guidelines were followed 24.8% could be delayed and if treating the worse seeing eye up to 57.6%. Many scheduled patients elected not to attend, with 67% not seen in the first 4 weeks. The impact of non-attendance and delays may be evaluated later.","Stone, Lydia G; Devenport, Adele; Stratton, Irene M; Talks, James S",Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol,148,1

This paper presents the design and implementation of a novel Internet of Things (IoT) device, called MEIoT weather station, which incorporates an exogenous disturbance input, within the National Digital Observatory of Smart Environments (OBNiSE) architecture. The exogenous disturbance input involves a wind blower based on a DC brushless motor. It can be controlled, via Node-RED platform, manually through a sliding bar, or automatically via different predefined profile functions, modifying the wind speed and the wind vane sensor variables. An application to Engineering Education is presented with a case study that includes the instructional design for the least-squares regression topic for linear, quadratic, and cubic approximations within the Educational Mechatronics Conceptual Framework (EMCF) to show the relevance of this proposal. This work's main contribution to the state-of-the-art is to turn a weather monitoring system into a hybrid hands-on learning approach thanks to the integrated exogenous disturbance input.","Guerrero-Osuna, Héctor A; Luque-Vega, Luis F; Carlos-Mancilla, Miriam A; Ornelas-Vargas, Gerardo; Castañeda-Miranda, Víctor H; Carrasco-Navarro, Rocío",Sensors (Basel),148,26

The genomes of two closely related parvoviruses, namely peafowl parvovirus 1 (PePV1) and PePV2, were identified with size of 4428 bp and 4348 bp, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that both viruses are novel parvoviruses, belonging to the proposed genus Chapparvovirus of Parvoviridae. The transcriptional profile of PePV1 was analyzed by transfecting a nearly complete PePV1 genome into HEK-293T cells. Results revealed that PePV1 employs one promoter and two polyadenylation sites to start and terminate its transcriptions, with one donor site and two acceptor sites for pre-mRNA splicing.

We administered trial treatment per day for a maximum of 7 days until either death or hospital discharge. We measured zinc concentration at baseline and during treatment and observed patients for any significant side effects. For eligible patients, we randomized and administered treatment to 33 adult participants to either HDIVZn (n = 15) or placebo (n = 18). We observed no serious adverse events throughout the study for a total of 94 HDIVZn administrations. However, three participants in the HDIVZn group reported infusion site irritation. Mean serum zinc on Day 1 in the placebo, and the HDIVZn group was 6.9 ± 1.1 and 7.7 ± 1.6 µmol/l, respectively, consistent with zinc deficiency. HDIVZn, but not placebo, increased serum zinc levels above the deficiency cutoff of 10.7 µmol/l (p < .001) on Day 6. Our study did not reach its target enrollment because stringent public health measures markedly reduced patient hospitalizations. Hospitalized COVID-19 patients demonstrated zinc deficiency. This can be corrected with HDIVZn. Such treatment appears safe, feasible, and only associated with minimal peripheral infusion site irritation. This pilot study justifies further investigation of this treatment in COVID-19 patients.","Patel, Oneel; Chinni, Vidyasagar; El-Khoury, John; Perera, Marlon; Neto, Ary S; McDonald, Christine; See, Emily; Jones, Daryl; Bolton, Damien; Bellomo, Rinaldo; Trubiano, Jason; Ischia, Joseph",J Med Virol,148,28

The mortality rate of patients who suffer OHCA remains high despite extensive utilization of resources. OBJECTIVES: We aim to describe the current landscape of OHCA during the COVID-19 pandemic and provide an overview of the logistical challenges and resuscitation protocols amongst emergency medical service (EMS) personnel. DISCUSSION: Recent studies in Italy, New York City, and France characterized a significant increase in OHCA incidence in conjunction with the arrival of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The presence of the pandemic challenged existing protocols for field resuscitation of cardiac arrest patients as the pandemic necessitated prioritization of EMS personnel and other healthcare providers' safety through stringent personal protective equipment (PPE) requirements. Studies also characterized difficulties encountered by the first responder system during COVID-19, such as dispatcher overload, increased response times, and adherence to PPE requirements, superimposed on PPE shortages. The lack of guidance by governmental agencies and specialty organizations to provide unified safety protocols for resuscitation led to the development of different resuscitative protocols globally. CONCLUSIONS: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic modified the approach of first responders to OHCA. With the rise in OCHA during the pandemic in several geographic regions and the risks of disease transmission with superimposed equipment shortages, novel noninvasive, adjunct tools, such as point of care ultrasound, warrant consideration. Further prehospital studies should be considered to optimize OHCA and resource management while minimizing risk to personnel.","Ong, Justin; O039,; Connell, Francis; Mazer-Amirshahi, Maryann; Pourmand, Ali",Am J Emerg Med,148,1

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to document the change in diet quality and in food insecurity observed during the COVID-19-related early lockdown. We hypothesized that the lockdown was associated with a deterioration in overall diet quality and an increase in food insecurity. METHODS: Data are from a COVID-19 subsample of NutriQuébec, a web-based cohort destined to study temporal changes in dietary habits among adults in Quebec, Canada. Participants completed questionnaires before (between June 2019 and February 2020) and during (April to May 2020) early lockdown, including a validated web-based 24-h recall (n = 853) and a questionnaire on food security (n = 922). Primary study outcomes were temporal changes in diet quality measured by the Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2015 and in the prevalence of food insecurity. RESULTS: There was a small increase in the HEI-2015 during the COVID-19 early lockdown compared with baseline (+1.1 points; 95% CI: 0.6, 1.5), mostly due to small improvements in the intakes of whole grains, greens and beans, refined grains, total vegetables, total dairy, seafood and plant proteins, added sugar, and total protein subscores of the HEI-2015. Exploratory analyses suggested that individuals aged 18-29 y (+3.6 points; 95% CI: 2.4, 4.7), participants with lower education (+1.9 points; 95% CI: 1.3, 2.6), or with obesity (+3.8 points; 95% CI: 2.7, 4.8) showed particularly important increases in the HEI-2015. The prevalence of food insecurity was reduced from 3.8% at baseline to 1.0% during the early lockdown (prevalence ratio = 0.27; 95% CI: 0.08, 0.94). CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to our hypotheses, diet quality has slightly improved and prevalence of food insecurity was reduced in this sample of adults from Quebec during the COVID-19-related early lockdown. These results may be generalizable only to relatively healthy populations.","Lamarche, Benoît; Brassard, Didier; Lapointe, Annie; Laramée, Catherine; Kearney, Michèle; Côté, Mélina; Bélanger-Gravel, Ariane; Desroches, Sophie; Lemieux, Simone; Plante, Céline",Am. j. clin. nutr,148,24

OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to understand how communication between families, patients and the ICU team was enabled during the pandemic. Secondary objectives were to understand strategies used to facilitate virtual visiting and associated benefits and barriers. METHODS: Multi-centre, cross-sectional, self-administered electronic survey sent (June 2020) to all 217 UK hospitals with at least one ICU. RESULTS: Survey response rate was 54%; 117/217 hospitals (182 ICUs). All hospitals imposed visiting restrictions with visits not permitted under any circumstance in 16% of hospitals (28 ICUs); 63% (112 ICUs) permitted family presence at end of life. Responsibility for communicating with families shifted with decreased bedside nurse involvement. A dedicated ICU family liaison team was established in 50% (106 ICUs) of hospitals. All but three hospitals instituted virtual visiting, although there was substantial heterogeneity in the videoconferencing platform used. Unconscious or sedated ICU patients were deemed ineligible for virtual visits in 23% of ICUs. Patients at end of life were deemed ineligible for virtual visits in 7% of ICUs. Commonly reported benefits of virtual visiting were reducing patient psychological distress (78%), improving staff morale (68%) and reorientation of delirious patients (47%). Common barriers to virtual visiting related to insufficient staff time, rapid implementation of videoconferencing technology, and challenges associated with family member ability to use videoconferencing technology or have access to a device. CONCLUSIONS: Virtual visiting and dedicated communication teams were common COVID-19 innovations addressing restrictions to family ICU visiting, and resulting in valuable benefits in terms of patient recovery and staff morale. Enhancing access and developing a more consistent approach to family virtual ICU visiting could improve quality of care, both during and outside of pandemic conditions.","Rose, Louise; Yu, Lisa; Casey, Joseph; Cook, Amelia; Metaxa, Victoria; Pattison, Natalie; Rafferty, Anne Marie; Ramsay, Pam; Saha, Sian; Xyrichis, Andreas; Meyer, Joel",Ann.

Their residents also are at higher risk than the general population for morbidity and mortality associated with infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in light of the association of severe outcomes with older age and certain underlying medical conditions (1,3). CDC's National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) launched nationwide, facility-level COVID-19 nursing home surveillance on April 26, 2020. A federal mandate issued by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), required nursing homes to commence enrollment and routine reporting of COVID-19 cases among residents and staff members by May 25, 2020. This report uses the NHSN nursing home COVID-19 data reported during May 25-November 22, 2020, to describe COVID-19 rates among nursing home residents and staff members and compares these with rates in surrounding communities by corresponding U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) region.* COVID-19 cases among nursing home residents increased during June and July 2020, reaching 11.5 cases per 1,000 resident-weeks (calculated as the total number of occupied beds on the day that weekly data were reported) (week of July 26). By mid-September, rates had declined to 6.3 per 1,000 resident-weeks (week of September 13) before increasing again, reaching 23.2 cases per 1,000 resident-weeks by late November (week of November 22). COVID-19 cases among nursing home staff members also increased during June and July (week of July 26 = 10.9 cases per 1,000 resident-weeks) before declining during August-September (week of September 13 = 6.3 per 1,000 resident-weeks); rates increased by late November (week of November 22 = 21.3 cases per 1,000 resident-weeks). Rates of COVID-19 in the surrounding communities followed similar trends. Increases in community rates might be associated with increases in nursing home COVID-19 incidence, and nursing home mitigation strategies need to include a comprehensive plan to monitor local SARS-CoV-2 transmission and minimize high-risk exposures within facilities.","Bagchi, Suparna; Mak, Josephine; Li, Qunna; Sheriff, Edward; Mungai, Elisabeth; Anttila, Angela; Soe, Minn Minn; Edwards, Jonathan R; Benin, Andrea L; Pollock, Daniel A; Shulman, Evan; Ling, Shari; Moody-Williams, Jean; Fleisher, Lee A; Srinivasan, Arjun; Bell, Jeneita M",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,148,16

Currently, attempts to generate a vaccine against the coronavirus are ongoing. To understand SARS-CoV-2 immunoreactivity, we compared the IgG antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 in infected versus control patients by dot blot using recombinant viral particle proteins: N (Nucleocapsid), M (Membrane) and S (Spike). In addition, we used different protein fragments of the N and S protein to map immune epitopes. Most of the COVID-19 patients presented a specific immune response against the full length and fragments of the N protein and, to lesser extent, against a fragment containing amino acids 300-685 of the S protein. In contrast, immunoreactivity against other S protein fragments or the M protein was low. This response is specific for COVID-19 patients as very few of the control patients displayed immunoreactivity, likely reflecting an immune response against other coronaviruses. Altogether, our results may help develop method(s) for measuring COVID-19 antibody response, selectivity of methods detecting such SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and vaccine development.","Smits, Veronique A J; Hernández-Carralero, Esperanza; Paz-Cabrera, María Cristina; Cabrera, Elisa; Hernández-Reyes, Yeray; Hernández-Fernaud, Juan Ramón; Gillespie, David A; Salido, Eduardo; Hernández-Porto, Miriam; Freire, Raimundo",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,148,23

The virus has mostly affected elderly populations, but there may be corollary effects on young adults' psychosocial adjustment due to educational, economic, and occupational disruptions. Using latent class analysis, we examined unique typologies of coping in response to the pandemic among young adults. We used an expanded set of indicators including traditional measures of problem- and emotion-focused coping as well as measures of resilience and coping flexibility. We also examined whether class membership could be predicted by demographics, stress appraisal, and psychosocial characteristics including catastrophic thinking and impulsivity. The sample of 1,391 young adults (ages 18-35) was recruited via Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) and snowball methods from late-April to early-May 2020. Six classes were identified: (1) Resilient Flexible Problem-Focused Copers, (2) Resilient Inflexible Problem-Focused Copers, (3) Non-Resilient Flexible Problem-Focused Venters, (4) Non-Resilient Flexible Problem-Focused Copers, (5) Non-Resilient Flexible Non-Copers, and (6) Non-Resilient Inflexible Non-Copers. Using Class 1 as the reference class, we found perceived centrality and uncontrollability of the pandemic as well as catastrophic thinking and impulsivity were significant predictors of class membership. The mean levels of stress appraisal and psychosocial characteristics varied significantly between the classes, reinforcing the structural validity of these classes. The findings suggest the importance of training young adults to develop resilience and flexibility as well as specific coping skills that can help offset the psychological effects of dramatic lifestyle changes that may result from pandemics or other health crises in the future.","Shigeto, Aya; Laxman, Daniel J; Landy, Justin F; Scheier, Lawrence M",J Gen Psychol,148,24

Demographic data, the mental health scores, diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) data, and plasma metabolomics were collected and compared between the two groups. Tract-based spatial statistics and graph theory approaches were used for DTI data analysis. Untargeted metabolomics analysis of the plasma was performed. Correlation analyses were performed between these characteristics. Recovered COVID-19 patients showed decreased fractional anisotropy, increased mean diffusivity and radial diffusivity values in widespread brain regions, and significantly lower global efficiency, longer shortest path length, and less nodal local efficiency in superior occipital gyrus (all, P < 0.05, Bonferroni corrected). Our results also demonstrated significantly different plasma metabolic profiling in recovered COVID-19 patients even at 3 months after their hospital discharge, which was mainly related to purine pathways, amino acids, lipids, and amine metabolism. Certain regions with cerebral WM alterations in the recovered patients showed significant correlations with different metabolites and the mental health scores. We observed multiple alterations in both WM integrity and plasma metabolomics that may explain the deteriorated mental health of recovered COVID-19 patients. These findings may provide potential biomarkers for the mental health evaluation for the recovered COVID-19 patients and potential targets for novel therapeutics.","Yang, Lian; Zhou, Mei; Li, Lingli; Luo, Ping; Fan, Wenliang; Xu, Juanjuan; Chen, Qing; Pan, Feng; Lei, Ping; Zheng, Chuansheng; Jin, Yang",Transl Psychiatry,148,26

SLPs who recognize the potential application of telecommunications would profit from additional training and experience to take advantage of the benefits of this service delivery model. The purpose of this article is to explore the concept of telepractice as a service delivery model, and to answer the who, what, when, where, and why questions of school-based telepractice. Telepractice is one of several service delivery models that school-based SLPs can confidently utilize to provide effective speech and language therapy services to school-age students.","Grogan-Johnson, Sue",Semin Speech Lang,148,6

OBJECTIVE: Recent reviews have examined the role of digital health in controlling COVID-19 to identify the potential of digital health to fight against the disease. However, this study is aimed at reviewing and analyzing applied digital technology to control the COVID-19 pandemic in ten countries with the highest prevalence of the disease. METHODS: For this review, Google Scholar, PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were searched in August 2020 to retrieve publications from December 2019 to 15 March 2020. Furthermore, the Google search engine was also investigated to identify additional applications of digital health for COVID-19 pandemic control. RESULTS: 32 papers were included in this review reported 37 digital health applications for COVID-19 control. Most of the projects for COVID-19 fighting were telemedicine visit (N=11, 30%). Digital learning packages for informing about the disease (N=7, 19%), GIS and QR code application for real-time case tracking (N=7, 19%), as well as cloud /mobile based systems for self-care and patient tracking (N=7, 19%) were in the second rank of digital tool applications. projects deployed by collaboration of European countries, USA, Australia, and China. CONCLUSIONS: Having considered the potential of available information technologies across the world in the 21st century, particularly in developed countries, it seems that more digital health products with higher level of intelligence capability have remained to be applied for pandemic and health related crisis management.","R Niakan Kalhori, Sharareh; Bahaadinibeigy, Kambiz; Deldar, Kolsoum; Gholamzadeh, Marsa; Hajesmaeel-Gohari, Sadrieh; Ayyoubzadeh, Seyed Mohammad",J. med. internet res,148,25

STUDY DESIGN: This is a prospective cohort study. METHODS: Compound growth rates were calculated using cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases from January 21, 2020, to March 31, 2020, in all 3139 US counties. Compound growth was chosen as it gives a single number that can be used in machine learning to represent the speed of virus spread during defined time intervals. Statistical analyses and a random forest machine learning model were used to analyze the data for differences in counties with and without SIP orders. RESULTS: Statistical analyses revealed that the March 16 presidential recommendation (limiting gatherings to &#8804;10 people) lowered the compound growth rate of COVID-19 for all counties in the US by 6.6%, and the counties that implemented SIP after March 16 had a further reduction of 7.8% compared with the counties that did not implement SIP after March 16. A random forest machine learning model was built to predict compound growth rate after a SIP order and was found to have an accuracy of 92.3%. The random forest found that population, longitude, and population per square mile were the most important features when predicting the effect of SIP. CONCLUSIONS: SIP orders were found to be effective at reducing the growth rate of COVID-19 cases in the US. Counties with a large population or a high population density were found to benefit the most from a SIP order.","Cobb, J S; Seale, M A",Public Health,148,16

One such strategy was our community conference calls, implemented to disseminate information on the pandemic and allow community leaders to discuss struggles and successes. Over the first 6 weeks, we held 12 calls, averaging 125 (standard deviation 41) participants. Participants were primarily from congregations and faith-based organizations that had an established relationship with the hospital, but also included school leaders, elected officials, and representatives of housing associations. Issues discussed included reasons for quarantining, mental health, social isolation, health disparities, and ethical concerns regarding hospital resources. Concerns identified by the community leaders as barriers to effective quarantining and adherence to precautions included food access, housing density, and access to screening and testing. Through the calls, ways to solve such challenges were addressed, with novel strategies and resources reaching the community.

Outcomes of ICU and non-ICU patients were compared, and a simple nomogram for predicting the probability of ICU transfer after hospital admission was developed based on initial laboratory data using a Cox proportional hazards regression model. Differences in laboratory indices were observed between patients admitted to the ICU and those who were not admitted. Several independent predictors of ICU transfer in COVID-19 patients were identified including older age (&#8805;65 years) (hazard ratio [HR] = 4.02), hypertension (HR = 2.65), neutrophil count (HR = 1.11), procalcitonin level (HR = 3.67), prothrombin time (HR = 1.28), and D-dimer level (HR = 1.25). The lymphocyte count and albumin level were negatively associated with mortality (HR = 0.08 and 0.86, respectively). The developed model provides a means for identifying, at hospital admission, the subset of patients with COVID-19 who are at high risk of progression and would require transfer to the ICU within 3 and 7 days after hospitalization. This method of early patient triage allows a more effective allocation of limited medical resources.","Zeng, Zihang; Ma, Yiming; Zeng, Huihui; Huang, Peng; Liu, Wenlong; Jiang, Mingyan; Xiang, Xudong; Deng, Dingding; Liao, Xin; Chen, Ping; Chen, Yan",J Med Virol,148,3

Las predicciones incluyen, población total contagiada, mortalidad y necesidad de recursos hospitalarios. Segundo objetivo: modelar la mortalidad y la necesidad de recursos hospitalarios, estratificando por edad el escenario de contagio del 70% de la población. Métodos Para el primer objetivo, nos basamos en el número de casos confirmados en el país hasta marzo 18, 2020 (n=93). Como suposiciones para el modelo, incluimos un índice de contagio R0=2,5 y el índice de casos reales por cada caso confirmado. Para la proporción de pacientes que necesitarían cuidados intensivos u otros cuidados intrahospitalarios, nos basamos en datos aportados por el Imperial College of London. Para el segundo objetivo usamos como tasa de mortalidad por edad, datos aportados por el Instituto Superiore di Sanità en Italia. Resultados Basándonos en los 93 casos reportados al 18 de marzo, si no se aplicase ninguna medida de mitigación, para el 18 de abril el país tendría un total de 613 037 casos. Medidas de mitigación que reduzcan el R0 en un 10%, generan una reducción del 50% del número de casos. Sin embargo, a pesar de reducirse los casos a la mitad, todavía habría un déficit en el número de camas requeridas y sólo uno de cada dos pacientes tendría acceso a dicho recurso. Conclusión En nuestro modelo encontramos que las medidas de mitigación que han sido implementadas hasta la fecha por el gobierno colombiano, se fundamentan en evidencia suficiente para pensar que es posible reducir significativamente el número de casos contagiados y con esto, el número de pacientes que requerirán manejo hospitalario.(AU)","González-Jaramillo, Valentina; González-Jaramillo, Nathalia; Gómez-Restrepo, Carlos; Palacio-Acosta, Carlos A; Gómez-López, Arley; Franco, Oscar H",Rev. salud pública,148,16

The positivity of a molecular test cannot respond to the question regarding the viral capability to replicate, spread, and give different clinical effects. Despite the fact that some targets are covered by commercially-available assays, the identification of new biomarkers is desired in order to improve the quality of the information given by these assays. Therefore, since the subgenomic transcripts (sgN and sgE) are considered markers of viral activity, we evaluated these subgenomic transcripts in relation to the genomic amplification obtained using five different commercial CE-IVD tools. Methods: Five CE-IVD kits were compared in terms of their capability to detect both synthetic SARS-CoV-2 viral constructs (spiked in TMB or PBS medium) and targets (N, E, RdRp and Orf1ab genes) in twenty COVID-19-positive patients' swabs. The sgN and sgE were assayed by real-time RT-qPCR and digital PCR. Results: None of the diagnostic kits missed the viral target genes when they were applied to targets spiked in TMB or PBS (at dilutions ranging from 100 pg to 0.1 pg). Nevertheless, once they were applied to RNA extracted from the patients' swabs, the superimposability ranged from 50% to 100%, regardless of the extraction procedure. The sgN RNA transcript was detected only in samples with a higher viral load (Ct &#8804; 22.5), while sgE was within all of the Ct ranges. Conclusions: The five kits show variable performances depending on the assay layout. It is worthy of note that the detection of the sgN transcript is associated with a higher viral load, thus representing a new marker of early and more severe infection.","Zollo, Massimo; Ferrucci, Veronica; Izzo, Barbara; Quarantelli, Fabrizio; Domenico, Carmela Di; Comegna, Marika; Paolillo, Carmela; Amato, Felice; Siciliano, Roberto; Castaldo, Giuseppe; Capoluongo, Ettore",Diagnostics (Basel),148,3

Failing to comply with this regulation entails a fine enforced by the police. Still, while many passersby do wear a mask that covers both their mouth and nose, others wear a mask improperly around their chin or neck or walk the streets wearing no mask at all. We speculate that the former passersby prepare themselves for a possible encounter with a police officer, in which case they could lie and claim that their mask unnoticeably slipped down from its proper position. The present paper reports the results of a field experiment designed to examine the hypothesis that, given the opportunity, passersby who wear their mask around their chin or neck are more likely to lie than those who wear no mask at all, although intuition may suggest otherwise. Incentivizing passersby's dishonesty with the Die-Under-the-Cup (DUCT) task, the experiment results support our hypothesis.","Tobol, Yossef; Siniver, Erez; Yaniv, Gideon",Econ Lett,148,1

METHODS: All studies published in English that gave satisfactory data regarding the assessment of OF in patients with OSA were included in this review. First, a baseline assessment of OF in patients with OSA who had not received any treatment was examined. Second, the effect of PAP therapy on OF was assessed to be able to make before and after comparisons. The primary outcome of this study was the threshold-discrimination identification (TDI) scores, obtained from the Sniffin' Sticks test. RESULTS: The database search identified 552 articles. According to the exclusion criteria, 11 studies involving 557 patients diagnosed with OSA were included in this meta-analysis. The general rate of olfactory dysfunction was 73% (95% CI: 56.481-87.057) among the patients with OSA. The patients with OSA had lower TDI scores compared to the control group and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.001). PAP treatment significantly improved the TDI scores in patients with OSA (p < 0.001). There was a significant negative correlation between the severity of apnea-hypopnea index and TDI scores (p = 0.001, z = -3.377, r = -0.438) and between age and TDI scores (p = 0.007, z = -2.695, r = -0.236). CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis demonstrates that OSA impairs OF, while PAP treatment can reverse the olfactory performance of patients with OSA.","Binar, Murat; Gokgoz, Mert Cemal",Sleep breath,148,7

It is shown that at the beginning of the pandemic where most people were still not aware, the R0 was very high as seen by the steep increase of people got infected and admitted to the hospitals. Few weeks after the lockdown of the region was in place and people were obeying the regulation and observing safe distancing, the R0 values dropped significantly and converged to a steady value of about 3. Using the obtained model parameters, fitted on a daily basis, the maximum number of active cases converged to a certain value of about 2500 cases. It is expected that in the early June 2020 that the number of active cases will drop to a significantly low level.","Putra, Zulfan Adi; Abidin, Shahrul Azman Zainal",Indonesian Journal Of Science And Technology,148,16

There are two important uncertainties in the management of people with diabetes undergoing major surgery: (1) how to improve diabetes management in the weeks leading up to an elective procedure and (2) whether that improved management leads to better postoperative outcomes. We previously demonstrated the feasibility of delivering the Optimising Cardiac Surgery ouTcOmes in People with diabeteS (OCTOPuS) intervention, an outpatient intervention delivered by diabetes healthcare professionals for people with suboptimally managed diabetes over 8-12 weeks before elective cardiac surgery. The present study will assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the intervention in cardiothoracic centres across the UK. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A multicentre, parallel group, single-blinded 1:1 individually randomised trial comparing time from surgery until clinically fit for discharge in adults with suboptimally managed type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes undergoing elective surgery between the OCTOPuS intervention and usual care (primary endpoint). Secondary endpoints will include actual time from surgery to discharge from hospital; days alive and either out of hospital or judged as clinically fit for discharge; mortality; time on intensive therapy unit (ITU)/ventilator; infections; acute myocardial infarction; change in weight; effect on postoperative renal function and incidence of acute kidney injury; change in HbA1c; frequency and severity of self-reported hypoglycaemia; operations permanently cancelled for suboptimal glycaemic levels; cost-effectiveness; psychosocial questionnaires.

Therefore, in the future, it will be increasingly important to develop unobtrusive and transparent cardiac monitoring technologies for the population. The possible approaches are the development of wearable technologies or the integration of sensors in daily-life objects. We developed a smart bed for monitoring cardiorespiratory functions during the night or in the case of continuous monitoring of bedridden patients. The mattress includes three accelerometers for the estimation of the ballistocardiogram (BCG). BCG signal is generated due to the vibrational activity of the body in response to the cardiac ejection of blood. BCG is a promising technique but is usually replaced by electrocardiogram due to the difficulty involved in detecting and processing the BCG signals. In this work, we describe a new algorithm for heart parameter extraction from the BCG signal, based on a moving auto-correlation sliding-window. We tested our method on a group of volunteers with the simultaneous co-registration of electrocardiogram (ECG) using a single-lead configuration. Comparisons with ECG reference signals indicated that the algorithm performed satisfactorily. The results presented demonstrate that valuable cardiac information can be obtained from the BCG signal extracted by low cost sensors integrated in the mattress.

Animal models demonstrating end-organ protection in C3-deficient mice and evidence of complement activation in humans have led to the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 triggers complement-mediated endothelial damage, but the mechanism is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (subunit 1 and 2), but not the N protein, directly activates the alternative pathway of complement (APC). Complement-dependent killing using the modified Ham test is blocked by either C5 or factor D inhibition. C3 fragments and C5b-9 are deposited on TF1PIGAnull target cells, and complement factor Bb is increased in the supernatant from spike protein–treated cells. C5 inhibition prevents the accumulation of C5b-9 on cells, but not C3c; however, factor D inhibition prevents both C3c and C5b-9 accumulation. Addition of factor H mitigates the complement attack. In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins convert nonactivator surfaces to activator surfaces by preventing the inactivation of the cell-surface APC convertase. APC activation may explain many of the clinical manifestations (microangiopathy, thrombocytopenia, renal injury, and thrombophilia) of COVID-19 that are also observed in other complement-driven diseases such as atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome and catastrophic antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. C5 inhibition prevents accumulation of C5b-9 in vitro but does not prevent upstream complement activation in response to SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins.","Yu, Jia; Yuan, Xuan; Chen, Hang; Chaturvedi, Shruti; Braunstein, Evan M.; Brodsky, Robert A.",Blood,148,5

METHODS: A retrospective case series was undertaken investigating the incidence and causes of bacteraemia in an adult intensive care unit with a high proportion of postoperative cardiothoracic surgical and oncology patients. RESULTS: 405 eligible patients were admitted to the intensive care unit over the course of nine months. 12 of these patients developed a unit-acquired blood stream infection. The average Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score of patients who developed bacteraemia was greater than that of those who did not (19.8 versus 16.8, respectively). The risk of developing bacteraemia was associated with intubation and higher rates of invasive procedures. The mortality rate amongst the group of patients that developed bacteraemia was 33%; this is in contrast to the mortality rate in our unit as 27.2%. There was a higher proportion of Gram-negative bacteria isolated on blood cultures (9 out of 13 isolates) than in intensive care units reported in other studies. CONCLUSION: Critical-care patients are at risk of secondary bloodstream infection. This study highlights the importance of measures to reduce the risk of infection in the intensive-care setting, particularly in patients who have undergone invasive procedures.","Harte, Jeffrey; Soothill, Germander; Samuel, John Glynn David; Sharifi, Laurence; White, Mary",Crit Care Res Pract,148,33

This is especially true at the elite level, where it has disrupted training and competition. Concomitantly, restrictions have disrupted long-term event planning. Many elite athletes remain unsure when major events will occur and worry about further interruptions. Although some athletes have successfully adapted to the demands of the COVID-19 crisis, many have experienced difficulties adjusting. This has resulted in psychological complications including increased stress, anxiety, and depression. This article critically examines the extent to which non-cognitive skills training, in the form of increased awareness of Mental Toughness, can help elite athletes inoculate against and cope with negative psychological effects arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. Non-cognitive skills encompass intrapersonal (motivations, learning strategies, and self-regulation) and interpersonal (interactions with others) domains not directly affected by intellectual capacity. Previous research indicates that enhancement of these spheres can assist performance and enhance mental well-being. Moreover, it suggests that training in the form of increased awareness of Mental Toughness, can improve the ability to cope with COVID-19 related challenges. In this context, Mental Toughness encompasses a broad set of enabling attributes (i.e., inherent and evolved values, attitudes, emotions, and cognitions). Indeed, academics commonly regard Mental Toughness as a resistance resource that protects against stress. Accordingly, this article advocates the use of the 4/6Cs model of Mental Toughness (i.e., Challenge, Commitment, Control, and Confidence) to counter negative psychological effects arising from COVID-19.","Dagnall, Neil; Drinkwater, Kenneth Graham; Denovan, Andrew; Walsh, R.

In screening mammography, clinical audits are used to assess radiologists’ performance annually, however, the nature of these audits prevent robust data analysis due to the low prevalence of breast cancer and the long waiting periods for the audit results. Research-based evidence revealed a need for changes in the methods utilised to optimise the assessment of the efficacy of radiologists’ interpretations. METHODS: A cloud-based platform was developed to assess and enhance radiologists’ performance help reduce variability in medical image interpretations in a research environment; however, to address a number of limitations, the platform was commercialised to make it available worldwide. RESULTS: DetectED-X’s team have been able to make their cloud-based platform available worldwide, tailored to the needs of radiologists and accredited for continuing medical/professional education; thus, changing the continuous professional development practice globally. CONCLUSION: DetectED-X’s Rivelato, was developed to address a need for effective, available and affordable educational solutions for clinicians and health care workers wherever they are located. A true fusion of industry, academia, clinics and consumer to adapt to the growing needs of clinicians’ around the world, the latest being COVID-19 global pandemic. DetectED-X repurposed its platform to educate physicians around the world on the appearances of COVID-19 on Lung Computed Tomography scans, introducing CovED to clinicians worldwide free of charge as a multi-national consortium of collaboration to help fight COVID-19, showing how research-based evidence can create effective and scalable change globally.","Suleiman, M.E.; Rickard, M.; Brennan, P.C.",Radiography (Lond),148,18

Here, real-space urban life was modeled as a modified scale-free network with constraints. To date, the scale-free network has been adopted for modeling online communities in several studies. However, in the present study, it has been modified to represent the social behaviors of people where the generated communities are restricted and reflect spatiotemporal constraints in real life. Furthermore, the networks have been extended by introducing multiple cliques in the initial step of network construction and enabling people to contact hidden (zero-degree) as well as popular (large-degree) people. Consequently, four findings and a policy proposal were obtained. First, “second waves” were observed in some cases of the simulations even without external influence or constraints on people’s social contacts or the releasing of the constraints. These waves tend to be lower than the first wave and occur in “fresh” clusters, that is, via the infection of people who are connected in the network but have not been infected previously. This implies that the bridge between infected and fresh clusters may trigger a new spread of the virus. Second, if the network changes its structure on the way of infection spread or after its suppression, a second wave larger than the first can occur. Third, the peak height in the time series of the number of infected cases depends on the difference between the upper bound of the number of people each member actually meets and the number of people they choose to meet during the period of infection spread. This tendency is observed for the two kinds of artificial networks introduced here and implies the impact of bridges between communities on the virus spreading. Fourth, the release of a previously imposed constraint may trigger a second wave higher than the peak of the time series without introducing any constraint so far previously, if the release is introduced at a time close to the peak. Thus, overall, both the government and individuals should be careful in returning to society where people enjoy free inter-community contact.","Ohsawa, Yukio; Tsubokura, Masaharu",PLoS One,148,32

Our study shows that drug features and study keywords are most informative features, but all four types of features are essential for accurate trial prediction. By using predictive models, our approach achieves more than 0.87 AUC (Area Under the Curve) score and 0.81 balanced accuracy to correctly predict COVID-19 clinical trial completion vs. cessation. Our research shows that computational methods can deliver effective features to understand difference between completed vs. ceased COVID-19 trials.

Graphical and numerical illustrations are presented to visualize the behavior of different sundry parameters of interest on velocity and temperature. Outcomes reflect that volumetric fraction of nanoparticles causes to increase the thermal conductivity of the fluid and the temperature enhances due to blade type copper nanoparticles. The convergence analysis on the accuracy to solve the problem is investigated viably though the residual errors with different tolerances to prove the worth of the solver.

Surgical learning has been severely affected, and the impact on orthopedic surgery residency training has so far not been assessed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An online survey of 17 questions was sent via web link to orthopedic surgery residents throughout Spain between February 10, 2021 and February 28, 2021. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the care and training activities of residents were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 307 orthopedic surgery residents from all over Spain responded to the online survey. A total of 77.2% of the respondents had to suspend their rotations. Of these, 67.5% would like to resume the rotations they missed during the pandemic. A total of 69.7% of scheduled surgeries were suspended. Surgical activity was completely stopped for an average of 8 weeks. 66.8% of the residents consider that their surgical training has been affected and this will have repercussions on their future work. 49.5% considered the online training offered to be insufficient.

We determined the proportion of screening and surveillance colonoscopies appropriate for rescheduling to a future year through strict adoption of US Multi-Society Task Force (USMSTF) guidelines. METHODS: We conducted a single-center observational study of patients scheduled for “open-access colonoscopy”—ordered by a primary care provider without being seen in gastroenterology clinic—over a 6-week period during the COVID-19 pandemic. Each chart was reviewed to appropriately assign a surveillance year per USMSTF guidelines including demographics, colonoscopy history and family history. When guidelines recommended a range of colonoscopy intervals, both a “conservative” and “liberal” guideline adherence were assessed. RESULTS: We delayed 769 “open-access” screening or surveillance colonoscopies due to COVID-19. Between 14.8% (conservative) and 20.7% (liberal), colonoscopies were appropriate for rescheduling to a future year. Conversely, 415 (54.0%) patients were overdue for colonoscopy. Family history of CRC was associated with being scheduled too early for both screening (OR 3.9; CI 1.9–8.2) and surveillance colonoscopy (OR 2.6, CI 1.0–6.5). The most common reasons a colonoscopy was inappropriately scheduled this year were failure to use new surveillance colonoscopy intervals (28.9%), incorrectly applied family history guidelines (27.2%) and recommending early surveillance colonoscopy after recent normal colonoscopy (19.3%). CONCLUSION: Up to one-fifth of patients scheduled for “open-access” colonoscopy can be rescheduled into a future year based on USMSTF guidelines. Rigorously applying guidelines could judiciously allocate colonoscopy resources as we recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods This multicenter retrospective cohort study included all patients who were hospitalized due to COVID-19 from 21 hospitals in Hubei province, China between December 31, 2019 and April 21, 2020. Patients who were aged < 18 or ≥ 85 years old, in pregnancy, with acute lethal organ injury (e.g., acute myocardial infarction, severe acute pancreatitis, acute stroke), hypothyroidism, malignant diseases, severe malnutrition, and those with normal lipid profile under lipid-lowering medicines (e.g., statin, niacin, fenofibrate, gemfibrozil, and ezetimibe) were excluded. Propensity score matching (PSM) analysis at 1:1 ratio was performed to minimize baseline differences between patient groups of hyperlipidemia and non-hyperlipidemia. PSM analyses with the same strategies were further conducted for the parameters of hyperlipidemia in patients with increased triglyceride (TG), increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Mixed-effect Cox model analysis was performed to investigate the associations of the 28-days all-cause deaths of COVID-19 patients with hyperlipidemia and the abnormalities of lipid parameters. The results were verified in male, female patients, and in patients with pre-existing CVDs and type 2 diabetes. Results Of 10 945 inpatients confirmed as COVID-19, there were 9 822 inpatients included in the study, comprising 3513 (35.8%) cases without hyperlipidemia and 6309 (64.2%) cases with hyperlipidemia. Based on a mixed-effect Cox model after PSM at 1:1 ratio, hyperlipidemia was not associated with increased or decreased 28-day all-cause death [adjusted hazard ratio (HR), 1.17 (95% CI, 0.95-1.44), P =0.151]. We found that the parameters of hyperlipidemia were not associated with the risk of 28-day all-cause mortality [adjusted HR, 1.23 (95% CI, 0.98-1.55), P = 0.075 in TG increase group; 0.78 (95% CI, 0.57-1.07), P = 0.123 in LDL-C increase group; and 1.12 (95% CI, 0.9-1.39), P = 0.299 in HDL-C decrease group, respectively]. Hyperlipidemia was also not significantly associated with the increased mortality of COVID-19 in patients accompanied with CVDs or type 2 diabetes, and in both male and female cohorts. Conclusion Our study support that the imbalanced lipid profile is not significantly associated with the 28-day all-cause mortality of COVID-19 patients, even in those accompanied with CVDs or diabetes. Similar results were also obtained in subgroup analyses of abnormal lipid parameters. Therefore, hyperlipidemia might be not a major causative factor for poor outcome of COVID-19, which provides guidance for the intervention of inpatients during the epidemic of COVID-19.","Wu, Bin; Zhou, Jianghua; Wang, Wenxin; Yang, Huilin; Xia, Meng; Zhang, Binghong; She, Zhigang; Li, Hongliang",Chinese Medical Sciences Journal,148,1

The aim of this study was to illustrate the timeline of actions taken and to measure and analyze their impact on surgical patients. METHOD: This is a retrospective review of actions to limit Covid-19 spread and their impact on surgical activity in a Swiss tertiary referral center. Data on patient care, human resources and hospital logistics were collected. Impact on surgical activity was measured by comparing 6-week periods before and after the first measures were taken. RESULTS: After the first Swiss Covid-19 case appeared on February 25, progressively restrictive measures were taken over a period of 23 days. Covid-19 positive inpatients increased from 5 to 131, and ICU patients from 2 to 31, between days 10 and 30, respectively, without ever overloading resources. A 43% decrease of elective visceral surgical procedures was observed after Covid-19 (295 vs 165, p<0.01), while the urgent operations (all specialties) decreased by 39% (1476 vs 897, p<0.01). Fifty-two and 38 major oncological surgeries were performed, respectively, representing a 27% decrease (p = 0.316). Outpatient consultations dropped by 59%, from 728 to 296 (p<0.01).

DC activation reflects a balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory signals. One anti-inflammatory factor is prostaglandin D2 signaling through its cognate receptor, D-prostanoid receptor 1 (PTGDR), on myeloid cells. Loss of PTGDR signaling might be expected to enhance DC activation and EAE but here we show that PTGDR(−/)(−) mice developed only mild signs of MOG(35-55) peptide immunization-induced EAE. Compared to wild type mice, PTGDR(−/)(−) mice exhibited less demyelination, decreased leukocyte infiltration and diminished microglia activation. These effects resulted from increased pro-inflammatory responses in the lymph nodes, most notably in IL-1β production, with the unexpected consequence of increased activation-induced apoptosis of MOG(35-55) peptide-specific T cells. Conditional deletion of PTGDR on DCs, and not other myeloid cells ameliorated EAE. Together, these results demonstrate the indispensable role that PGD(2)/PTGDR signaling on DCs has in development of pathogenic T cells in autoimmune demyelination.","Zheng, Jian; Sariol, Alan; Meyerholz, David; Zhang, Qinran; Abrahante Lloréns, Juan E.; Narumiya, Shuh; Perlman, Stanley",J Autoimmun,148,16

The extraction and the elution can be performed with the entire set-up encapsulated in a transparent bag, minimizing the risk of infection for the operator. With 0.35 mL extraction buffer and six swabs, including a positive control swab, 43 ± 6% (n = 8) of the signal for an individual extraction of a positive control standard was obtained. Image analysis still showed a signal-to-noise ratio of approximately 2:1 at 32-fold dilution of the extract from a single positive control swab. The relative signal from the test line versus the control line was found to scale linearly upon dilution (R(2) = 0.98), indicating that other pooling regimes are conceivable. A pilot project involving 14 participants and 18 pooled tests in a laboratory course at our university did not give any false positives, and an individual case study confirmed the ability to detect a SARS-CoV-2 infection with five-fold or six-fold pooling, including one swab from a PCR-confirmed COVID patient. These findings suggest that pooling can make frequent testing more affordable for schools, universities, and similar institutions, without decreasing sensitivity to an unacceptable level.","Berking, Tim; Lorenz, Sabrina G.; Ulrich, Alexander B.; Greiner, Joachim; Kervio, Eric; Bremer, Jennifer; Wege, Christina; Kleinow, Tatjana; Richert, Clemens",Diagnostics (Basel),148,20

The purpose of this study was to examine the availability, target cell types and efficiency of RNAi in the mouse seminiferous epithelium. METHODS: The experimental model was based on transgenic mice expressing EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein). RNAi was induced by in vivo transfection of plasmid vectors encoding for short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting EGFP. shRNAs were transfected in vivo by microinjection into the seminiferous tubules via the rete testis followed by square wave electroporation. As a transfection reporter, expression of red fluorescent protein (HcRed 1) was used. Cell types, the efficiency of both transfections and RNAi were all evaluated. RESULTS: Sertoli cells were the main transfected cells. A reduction of about 40% in the level of EGFP protein was detected in cells successfully transfected both in vivo and in vitro. However, the efficiency of in vivo transfection was low. CONCLUSION: In adult seminiferous epithelial cells, in vivo post-transcriptional gene silencing mediated by RNAi via shRNA is efficient in Sertoli cells. Similar levels of RNAi were detected both in vivo and in vitro. This also indicates that Sertoli cells have the necessary silencing machinery to repress the expression of endogenous genes via RNAi.","González-González, Emilio; López-Casas, Pedro P; del Mazo, Jesús",Reprod Biol Endocrinol,148,24

Primary care services have seen an upheaval, and more and more patients are engaging in telephone consultations in order to maintain social distancing. In the present study, we seek to quantify the effect of the pandemic on primary care prescribing. DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the English Prescribing Dataset from January 2014 to November 2020, totalling 7 542 293 921 prescriptions. Data were separated into prepandemic and pandemic sets. A Holt-Winters predictive model was used to forecast individual drug prescribing based on historic trends. Observed data were compared with the forecast quantitatively and qualitatively. SETTING: All prescriptions signed in England and dispensed during the years 2014–2020. PARTICIPANTS: All residents of England who received a prescription from primary care facilities during 2014–2020. RESULTS: Prescribing of numerous health-critical medications was above predicted in March 2020, including salbutamol (53.0% (99% CI (41.2% to 66.9%))), insulin aspart (26.9% (99% CI (18.5% to 36.6%))) and tacrolimus (18.6% (99% CI (8.3% to 31.1%))). Medications for end-of-life symptom control increased in April, including levomepromazine hydrochloride (94.7% (99% CI (54.6% to 163.0%))). Medications requiring face-to-face visits decreased, including the local anaesthetic bupivacaine hydrochloride (86.6% (99% CI (89.3% to 82.0%))). There was no observed change in medications relating to type 2 diabetes, hypertension or mental health conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Significantly increased prescribing of several medications was observed, especially among those critical for health. A dramatic spike in end-of-life prescribing highlights the adversity faced by community practitioners during 2020. Medications involving face-to-face consultations declined, as did contraceptives, travel-related vaccines and drugs used in dementia and Parkinson’s disease.

Virus budding in general involves the distortion of a cellular membrane away from the cytoplasm, envelopment of the viral capsid by one or more lipid bilayers that are enriched in viral membrane glycoproteins, and a fission event that separates the enveloped virion from the cellular membrane. While it was initially thought that virus budding is always driven by viral transmembrane proteins interacting with the inner structural proteins, it is now clear that the driving force may be different depending on the virus. Research over the past years has shown that viral components specifically interact with host cell lipids and proteins, thereby adopting cellular functions and pathways to facilitate virus release. This review summarizes the current knowledge of the cellular membrane systems that serve as viral budding sites and of the viral and cellular factors involved in budding. One of the best studied cellular machineries required for virus egress is the ESCRT complex, which will be described in more detail.","Welsch, Sonja; Müller, Barbara; Kräusslich, Hans-Georg",FEBS Lett,148,30

Although it primarily involves the respiratory tract system, cardiovascular complications, particularly arterial and venous thrombosis, are frequently reported and are associated with adverse outcomes. CASE SUMMARY: We describe the case of a 57-year-old female who presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and shock. She was found to have left lower extremity deep vein thrombosis and a suspected pulmonary embolism. A large mobile right atrial mass was found on echocardiogram. Given the large thrombus burden that portended an extremely high risk for embolization to the pulmonary arteries, emergent percutaneous aspiration of an organized thrombus (rather than thrombolysis) was performed using the AngioVac system (Angiodynamics Inc., Latham, NY, USA) complicated by haemodynamic collapse due to acute right ventricular failure. An Impella RP (Abiomed, Danvers, MA, USA) was then placed, with rapid stabilization of haemodynamics. The patient tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). She was treated with antimicrobial and systemic anticoagulation therapy. She was successfully weaned off the Impella RP on post-operative day 4 and was extubated on day 5. She was discharged on day 16 in a stable condition. DISCUSSION: Incident venous thrombo-embolism is frequently encountered in COVID-19 patients.

A significant amount of ivermectin could deposit into sediments of the semi-closed Mediterranean Sea, where three European COVID-19 epicenters are located: Italy, Spain, and France. Meiobenthic nematodes were exposed to three ivermectin doses (1.8 ng.g(−1), 9 ng.g(−1), and 18 ng.g(−1)) for 10 days. Ivermectin caused a great reduction in abundance. However, the diversity indices decreased only at high doses. Ivermectin disadvantaged the 1B-Cr-Id functional type (non-selective deposit feeders and nematodes with circular or indistinct amphids) and benefited the 2A-REL-Sp type (epistrate feeders and nematodes with rounded or elongated loop amphids). Thus, Trophic Diversity and Amphideal Diversity index values increased with sedimentary ivermectin enrichment. Large amphideal foveas were more efficient for 2A-REL-Sp nematodes to avoid ivermectin. The responses of the functional type 2A-REL-Sp and corresponding taxa predict post-COVID-19 environmental concerns and the bioaccumulation of ivermectin in seafoods.","Essid, Naceur; Allouche, Mohamed; Lazzem, Mounira; Harrath, Abdel Halim; Mansour, Lamjed; Alwasel, Saleh; Mahmoudi, Ezzeddine; Beyrem, Hamouda; Boufahja, Fehmi",Mar Pollut Bull,148,1

Selenium has an ongoing history of reducing the incidence and severity of various viral infections; for example, a German study found selenium status to be significantly higher in serum samples from surviving than non-surviving COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, a significant, positive, linear association was found between the cure rate of Chinese patients with COVID-19 and regional selenium status. Moreover, the cure rate continued to rise beyond the selenium intake required to optimise selenoproteins, suggesting that selenoproteins are probably not the whole story. Nonetheless, the significantly reduced expression of a number of selenoproteins, including those involved in controlling ER stress, along with increased expression of IL-6 in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells in culture suggests a potential link between reduced selenoprotein expression and COVID-19-associated inflammation. In this comprehensive review, we describe the history of selenium in viral infections and then go on to assess the potential benefits of adequate and even supra-nutritional selenium status. We discuss the indispensable function of the selenoproteins in coordinating a successful immune response and follow by reviewing cytokine excess, a key mediator of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19, and its relationship to selenium status. We comment on the fact that the synthetic redox-active selenium compound, ebselen, has been found experimentally to be a strong inhibitor of the main SARS-CoV-2 protease that enables viral maturation within the host. That finding suggests that redox-active selenium species formed at high selenium intake might hypothetically inhibit SARS-CoV-2 proteases. We consider the tactics that SARS-CoV-2 could employ to evade an adequate host response by interfering with the human selenoprotein system. Recognition of the myriad mechanisms by which selenium might potentially benefit COVID-19 patients provides a rationale for randomised, controlled trials of selenium supplementation in SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Zhang, Jinsong; Saad, Ramy; Taylor, Ethan Will; Rayman, Margaret P.",Redox Biol,148,16

In Australia, the cruise ship Ruby Princess became the largest COVID-19 epicenter. When the Ruby Princess arrived at the Port of Sydney in New South Wales on March 19, 2020, approximately 2,700 passengers disembarked. By March 24, about 130 had tested positive for COVID-19, and by March 27, the number had increased to 162. The purpose of this study is to analyze the relationship between the cruise industry and the COVID-19 outbreak. We take two perspectives: the first analysis focuses on the relationship between the estimated number of cruise passengers landing and the number of COVID-19 cases. We tracked the movement of all ocean cruise ships around the world using automatic identification system data from January to March 2020. We found that countries with arrival and departure ports and with ports that continued to accept cruise ships until March have a higher COVID-19 infection rate than countries that did not. The second analysis focuses on the characteristics of cruise ships infected with COVID-19. For this purpose, we utilize the list named “Cruise ships affected by COVID-19” released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As a result, cruise ships infected with COVID-19 were large in size and operated regular cruises that sailed from the same port of arrival and departure to the same ports of call on a weekly basis.","Ito, Hirohito; Hanaoka, Shinya; Kawasaki, Tomoya",Transportation research interdisciplinary perspectives,148,24

Electrolyte disorders particularly potassium abnormalities have been repeatedly reported as common clinical manifestations of COVID-19. Here, we discuss how SARS-CoV-2 may affect potassium balance by impairing the activity of epithelial sodium channels (ENaC). The first hypothesis could justify the incidence of hypokalemia. SARS-CoV-2 cell entry through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) may enhance the activity of renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) classical axis and further leading to over production of aldosterone. Aldosterone is capable of enhancing the activity of ENaC and resulting in potassium loss from epithelial cells. However, type II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) is able to inhibit the ENaC, but it is utilized in the case of SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, therefore the ENaC remains activated. The second hypothesis describe the incidence of hyperkalemia based on the key role of furin. Furin is necessary for cleaving both SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and ENaC subunits. While the furin is hijacked by the virus, the decreased activity of ENaC would be expected, which causes retention of potassium ions and hyperkalemia. Given that the occurrence of hypokalemia is higher than hyperkalemia in COVID-19 patients, the first hypothesis may have greater impact on potassium levels. Further investigations are warranted to determine the exact role of ENaC in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.","Noori, Maryam; Nejadghaderi, Seyed Aria; Sullman, Mark J.

To inform medical teams regarding potential hazards and suggest mitigating measures. METHODS Qualitatively, real-time time videography assessed exhalation patterns from simulated patients under different clinical scenarios using propylene glycol from an e-cigarette. Quantitatively, high-speed Schlieren imaging was performed to enable high resolution recordings analysable by MATLAB technical computing software. RESULTS Without a face mask, the standard prior to COVID 19, vapour was observed exiting through the opening in the drape over the surgical field. The amount of vapour increased when a surgical mask was worn. With a taped face mask, the amount of vapour decreased and with inclusion of a continuous suction device, the least amount of vapour was seen. These results were equivocal when the patient was supine or sitting upright. High-speed Schlieren imaging corroborated these findings and in addition showed substantial increase in airflow egress during coughing and with ill-fitting face masks. CONCLUSION Advising patients to wear a surgical mask at the time of ophthalmic interventions potentially contaminants the ocular field with patient generated aerosol risking endophthalmitis. Surgeon safety can be maintained with personal protective equipment to mitigate the increased egress of vapour from the surgical drape and taping, with or without suction is advisable, whilst meticulous hygiene around lenses is required at the time of slit lamp examination.","Anguita, Rodrigo; Brennan, Nicholas; Ramsden, Conor M; Mehat, Manjit; Keegan, David; Cahill, Ronan; Nolan, Kevin; O'Toole, Louise; Wickham, Louisa",European journal of ophthalmology,148,16

The main contributions of the article are: (1) Extend to this setting some results which were previously known in the case when each individual has only one kind of interactions. (2) Find an explicit formula for the basic reproduction number $R_0$ which depends only on the probabilities of transmitting the disease along the different edges and the first two moments of the degree distributions of the associated graphs. (3) Motivated by the recent Covid-19 pandemic, we use the framework developed to compute the $R_0$ of a model disease spreading in populations whose trees and degree distributions are adjusted to several different countries.

METHODS: Prospective cohort study of patients with sudden chemosensory loss since February 2020 and confirmed COVID-19 infection via RT-PCR or serology testing. Olfactory function was tested extensively using the “Sniffin Sticks” test battery. In addition, we screened gustatory perception and nasal cooling sensations using psychophysical tests. RESULTS: Seventy-two patients completed the study. After a mean of 37 days, 37% of patients showed olfactory dysfunction, 7% were dysgeusic, and 48% showed signs of low sensitivity for cooling sensation. A longer duration of anosmia before smell improvement was correlated with lower olfactory function at 5 weeks. Odor threshold detection was more affected by COVID-19 compared to odor identification. CONCLUSION: Five weeks after developing sudden chemosensory loss due to COVID-19, a high proportion of patients were dysosmic and showed signs of low nasal cooling sensitivity, whereas most of them had normal taste function. SARS-CoV-2 affected mainly odor thresholds, possibly suggesting that the major cause of loss of smell lies at the level of the olfactory neuroepithelium, rather than in the central nervous system.","Le Bon, Serge-Daniel; Pisarski, Nathalie; Verbeke, Justine; Prunier, Léa; Cavelier, Gaëtan; Thill, Marie-Paule; Rodriguez, Alexandra; Dequanter, Didier; Lechien, Jérôme R.; Le Bon, Olivier; Hummel, Thomas; Horoi, Mihaela",Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,148,21

The emerging trends in SARS-CoV-2 genome data show specific mutation and genetic diversity, which could provide the basis to develop a cocktail of vaccine and may also be used to develop the region-specific diagnostic tool, thus decreasing the chances of testing failures in fields. Since the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is subject to the extent of human interaction, the insights from the correlation of genetic diversity with epidemiological parameter would give paramount information to tackle this transmission. Previously, studies have also correlated the epidemiological data with gut microbiome and its role in immunomodulation for maintaining health status, and such information could be generated from recovered individuals from different demographic regions. It will help in designing a probiotic-based diet for modulation of the gut microbiome, and that could be another plausible prophylactic treatment option. The genomics data suggest that a specific variant of SARS-CoV-2 gets enriched with the specific demographic region. Overall, demographic data suggests that host influences mutation and expression of the virus. Hence, the experiences from the clinical intervention for that region should be considered in control and treatment strategies.","Bajaj, Abhay; Purohit, Hemant J.",Indian J Microbiol,148,1

Currently, there are no clinically proven pharmacotherapies for coronavirus disease 2019, despite promising initial results obtained from drugs such as azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine. Therefore, the repurposing of clinically approved drugs for use against SARS-CoV-2 has become a viable strategy. Here, we searched for drugs that target SARS-CoV-2 3C-like protease (3CL(pro)) and viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) by in silico screening of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved drug library. Well-tolerated and widely used drugs were selected for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to evaluate drug-protein interactions and their persistence under physiological conditions. Tetracycline, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, dutasteride, nelfinavir, and paliperidone formed stable interactions with 3CL(pro) based on MD simulation results. Similar analysis with RdRp showed that eltrombopag, tipranavir, ergotamine, and conivaptan bound to the enzyme with high binding free energies. Docking results suggest that ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, bromocriptine, dutasteride, conivaptan, paliperidone, and tipranavir can bind to both enzymes with high affinity. As these drugs are well tolerated, cost-effective, and widely used, our study suggests that they could potentially to be used in clinical trials for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients.

SARS-CoV-2 infects the pancreas through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), where it is highly expressed compared to other organs, leading to pancreatic damage with subsequent impairment of insulin secretion and development of hyperglycemia even in non-DM patients. Thus, this review aims to provide an overview of the potential link between COVID-19 and hyperglycemia as a risk factor for DM development in relation to DM pharmacotherapy. For that, a systematic search was done in the database of MEDLINE through Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Biology Medicine (CBM), and Wanfang Data. Data obtained underline that SARS-CoV-2 infection in DM patients is more severe and associated with poor clinical outcomes due to preexistence of comorbidities and inflammation disorders. SARS-CoV-2 infection impairs glucose homeostasis and metabolism in DM and non-DM patients due to cytokine storm (CS) development, downregulation of ACE2, and direct injury of pancreatic β-cells. Therefore, the potent anti-inflammatory effect of diabetic pharmacotherapies such as metformin, pioglitazone, sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2Is), and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors may mitigate COVID-19 severity. In addition, some antidiabetic agents and also insulin may reduce SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and severity through the modulation of the ACE2 receptor expression. The findings presented here illustrate that insulin therapy might seem as more appropriate than other anti-DM pharmacotherapies in the management of COVID-19 patients with DM due to low risk of uncontrolled hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). From these findings, we could not give the final conclusion about the efficacy of diabetic pharmacotherapy in COVID-19; thus, clinical trial and prospective studies are warranted to confirm this finding and concern.","Al-kuraishy, Hayder M.; Al-Gareeb, Ali I.; Alblihed, M.; Guerreiro, Susana G.; Cruz-Martins, Natália; Batiha, Gaber El-Saber",Front Cardiovasc Med,148,28

DESIGN: Observational cohort study. SETTING: A total of 258 adult critical care units. PATIENTS: A total of 10,362 patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 with a start of critical care between March 1, 2020, and June 22, 2020, of whom 9,990 were eligible (excluding patients with a duration of critical care less than 24 hr or missing core variables). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The main outcome measure was time to death within 30 days of the start of critical care. Of 9,990 eligible patients (median age 60 yr, 70% male), 3,933 died within 30 days of the start of critical care. As of July 22, 2020, 189 patients were still receiving critical care and a further 446 were still in acute hospital. Data were missing for between 0.1% and 7.2% of patients across prognostic factors. We imputed missing data ten-fold, using fully conditional specification and continuous variables were modeled using restricted cubic splines. Associations between the candidate prognostic factors and time to death within 30 days of the start of critical care were determined after adjustment for multiple variables with Cox proportional hazards modeling. Significant associations were identified for age, ethnicity, deprivation, body mass index, prior dependency, immunocompromise, lowest systolic blood pressure, highest heart rate, highest respiratory rate, Pao(2)/Fio(2) ratio (and interaction with mechanical ventilation), highest blood lactate concentration, highest serum urea, and lowest platelet count over the first 24 hours of critical care. Nonsignificant associations were found for sex, sedation, highest temperature, and lowest hemoglobin concentration. CONCLUSIONS: We identified patient characteristics that predict an increased likelihood of death within 30 days of the start of critical care for patients with coronavirus disease 2019. These findings may support development of a prediction model for benchmarking critical care providers.","Ferrando-Vivas, Paloma; Doidge, James; Thomas, Karen; Gould, Doug W.; Mouncey, Paul; Shankar-Hari, Manu; Young, J.

These young people, however, are an often-neglected research population, due in part to perceived challenges associated with their inclusion as well as marginalized communities’ justifiable mistrust of research. OBJECTIVES: Based on our experience conducting a school-based randomized intervention trial in Baltimore, Maryland, we present strategies for conducting research with low-income, urban youth of color. We discuss strategies in three domains: university-community partnership development, participant recruitment, and participant retention. METHODS: We reviewed partnership building and recruitment strategies employed by our team across four years of trial implementation and evaluated success of participant retention at our final survey timepoint. RESULTS: Partnership building was facilitated by selecting a study design that maximized benefits for all participants, facilitation of capacity building at partner institutions, and attention to research staff hiring and training practices. Effective study recruitment strategies included personal contact with parents and close cooperation between school personnel and study staff. Providing incentives and collecting multiple types of participant contact information contributed to increased retention rates. On average, those who participated in the final survey timepoint were less likely to be male and Latinx and exhibited more favorable baseline mental health than those who did not, suggesting differential attrition based on youth characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Lessons learned from this school-based trial can be applied more broadly to research with low-income urban youth of color. Researchers should strive to maximize scientific rigor, minimize harm to vulnerable adolescents and their communities, promote positive research experiences for young people, and provide concrete benefits to those who participate.","Mendelson, Tamar; Sheridan, Steven C.; Clary, Laura K.",Res Social Adm Pharm,148,4

In Queensland, the highest number of H1N1 cases were admitted to the intensive care unit when compared with the other Australian states. While many recent studies examining the H1N1 pandemic have focussed on service delivery and disease epidemiology, few have explored the lived experiences of frontline health care workers caring for the patients in the intensive care unit. OBJECTIVES: The purposes of this study were to: document and describe the lived experiences of the nursing and medical staff caring for patients in the intensive care unit during the H1N1 pandemic; to validate the staffs’ experiences; and to assist in informing future pandemic planning by highlighting the collective experiences of these frontline health care workers. DESIGN: A phenomenological study method was used. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 34 staff from a tertiary referral hospital in Brisbane, Australia participated in the study. METHODS: Data was collected using an open ended questionnaire and focus groups. The resulting responses were analysed using Colaizzi's framework to discover regular patterns of meaning that emerged. RESULTS: Eight common themes emerged: the wearing of personal protective equipment; infection control procedures; the fear of contracting and transmitting the disease; adequate staffing levels within the intensive care unit; new roles for staff; morale levels; education regarding extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; and the challenges of patient care. These eight themes articulate the lived experience of the staff during the height of the H1N1 Influenza pandemic period. CONCLUSIONS: Planning for a pandemic situation is invariably difficult due to the unpredictable nature of the event itself. Recommendations for future pandemic planning which can be drawn from this study include the appointment of a dedicated infection control representative to provide information and support regarding infection control matters; the maintenance of effective communication channels is crucial; and the increased staffing requirements across nursing, medical, allied health and ancillary staff to cope with the higher patient numbers and acuity must be anticipated and planned for.","Corley, Amanda; Hammond, Naomi E.; Fraser, John F.",Int J Nurs Stud,148,3

We longitudinally studied CD4 T-cell responses to the M, N, and S structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 in 26 convalescent individuals. Within the first two months following symptom onset, a majority of individuals (81%) mounted at least one CD4 T-cell response, and 48% of individuals mounted detectable SARS-CoV-2-specific circulating T follicular helper cells (cTfh, defined as CXCR5(+)PD1(+) CD4 T cells). SARS-CoV-2-specific cTfh responses across all three protein specificities correlated with antibody neutralization with the strongest correlation observed for S protein-specific responses. When examined over time, cTfh responses, particularly to the M protein, increased in convalescence, and robust cTfh responses with magnitudes greater than 5% were detected at the second convalescent visit, a median of 38 days post-symptom onset. CD4 T-cell responses declined but persisted at low magnitudes three months and six months after symptom onset. These data deepen our understanding of antigen-specific cTfh responses in SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that in addition to S protein, M and N protein-specific cTfh may also assist in the development of neutralizing antibodies and that cTfh response formation may be delayed in SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Boppana, Sushma; Qin, Kai; Files, Jacob K.; Russell, Ronnie M.; Stoltz, Regina; Bibollet-Ruche, Frederic; Bansal, Anju; Erdmann, Nathan; Hahn, Beatrice H.; Goepfert, Paul A.",PLoS Pathog,148,16

The arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO(2)) is the most clinically used variable to assess such oxygenation, since it decisively influences the oxygen transported by hemoglobin (expressed by its percentage of saturation, SaO(2)). However, two recent studies conducted respectively in silico and using omic techniques in red blood cells of COVID-19 patients have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could decrease the affinity of oxygen for the hemoglobin (which would imply that PaO(2) would overestimate SaO(2)), and also reduce the amount of this carrier molecule. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate this hypothesis in blood samples from COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Blood gases of all COVID-19 patients performed in our laboratory in two months were included, as well as those from two control groups: synchronous patients with negative PCR for SARS-CoV-2 (SCG) and a historical group (HCG). Both SaO(2) and venous saturations (SvO(2)) measured by cooximetry (COX) were compared separately with those calculated using the Kelman (K), Severinghaus (SV) and Siggaard-Andersen (SA) equations in each group. RESULTS: Measured and calculated SaO(2) and SvO(2) were practically equivalent in all groups. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) for SaO(2) in COVID-19 were 0.993 for COX-K and 0.992 for both COX-SV and COX-SA; being 0.995 for SvO(2) for either COX-K, COX-SV or COX-SA. Hemoglobin and ferritin were slightly higher in COVID-19 compared to SCG and HCG (hemoglobin, p < 0.001 for both; ferritin, p < 0.05 for SCG and p < 0.001 for HCG). CONCLUSION: Under clinical conditions SARS-CoV-2 does not have an appreciable influence on the affinity of oxygen for the hemoglobin, nor on the levels of this carrier molecule. Therefore, PaO(2) is a good marker of blood oxygenation also in COVID-19.","Pascual-Guàrdia, Sergi; Ferrer, Antoni; Díaz, Óscar; Caguana, Antonio O.; Tejedor, Elvira; Bellido-Calduch, Salomé; Rodríguez-Chiaradia, Diego A.; Gea, Joaquim",Arch Bronconeumol,148,1

Concomitantly, with this increase in travel is the increase in post travel-related diseases, such as respiratory illnesses. Identifying the cause of the posttravel respiratory illness is a complex challenge for many healthcare professionals because similar presentations occur for both infectious and noninfectious causes. Not only is diagnosis important but also transmission prevention. In the last two decades, there have been several severe infectious respiratory syndromes that have spread through international travel causing epidemics in many countries. RECENT FINDINGS: A detailed travel history with the chronology of symptoms paired with the patient's medical risk factors and exposures along with some basic knowledge of infectious respiratory illnesses will help facilitate clinical decision making. This framework will help create a broad, but appropriate differential diagnosis to guide clinical workup, prevent delays in diagnosis, and implement the appropriate precautions to prevent transmission if appropriate. SUMMARY: The foundation to diagnosing a travel-related respiratory illness lies within integrating the patient's travel history, comorbid conditions, clinical presentation, exposures, and mode of transmission. A timely and accurate diagnosis benefits not only the patient but also the surrounding community to prevent further individual transmission, epidemics, and pandemics.","Duong, Theresa N.; Waldman, Sarah E.",Curr Emerg Hosp Med Rep,148,3

However, this is not to discredit CAD’s ability but to further encourage the adoption of artificial intelligence-based algorithms into the toolset of radiologists. Methods: This study will use Hologic (Marlborough, MA, USA) and General Electric (Boston, MA, USA) CAD read images provided by patients found to be Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) 6 from 2019 to 2020. In addition, patient information will be pulled from our institution’s emergency medical record to confirm the findings seen in the pathologist report and the radiology read. Results: Data from a total of 24 female breast cancer patients from January 31st 2019 to April 31st 2020, was gathered from our institution’s emergency medical record with restrictions in patient numbers due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Within our patient population, CAD imaging was shown to be statistically significant in misidentifying breast cancer, while radiologist interpretation still proves to be the most effective tool. Conclusion: Despite a low sample size due to COVID-19, this study found that CAD did have significant difficulty in differentiating benign vs. malignant lesions. CAD should not be ignored, but it is not specific enough. Although CAD often marks cancer, it also marks several areas that are not cancer. CAD is currently best used as an additional tool for the radiologist.","Saenz Rios, Florentino; Movva, Giri; Movva, Hari; Nguyen, Quan D",Cureus,148,0

In the present study, we conducted a literature review about the potential infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in different biological tissues and the influence of various tissue processing and sterilization procedures on viral inactivation. The search revealed that SARS-CoV-2 binds to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor to penetrate human cells. These receptors are present in skin cells, musculoskeletal tissue, amniotic membranes, cardiovascular tissue and ocular tissues, including the cornea. In general, we found that coronaviruses are stable at low temperatures, and inactivated upon exposure to extreme heat and pH. Notably, gamma irradiation, which has already been employed to inactivate SARS and MERS, could be useful for sterilizing skin, amnion and musculoskeletal tissues against SARS-CoV-2. We conclude that due to the limited information about the effects of physical and chemical tissue processing methods on viral neutralization, rigorous donor screening is still essential for tissue transplant recipient safety.","Paggiaro, André Oliveira; Carvalho, Viviane Fernandes; Gemperli, Rolf",Cell Tissue Bank,148,28

EWSs are model-independent methods that have grown in popularity to support evidence of disease emergence and disease elimination. Theoretical work has demonstrated their capability of detecting disease transitions in simple epidemic models, where elimination is reached through vaccination, to more complex vector transmission, age-structured and metapopulation models. However, the exact time evolution of EWSs depends on the transition; here we review the literature to provide guidance on what trends to expect and when. Recent advances include methods which detect when an EWS becomes significant; the earlier an upcoming disease transition is detected, the more valuable an EWS will be in practice. We suggest that future work should firstly validate detection methods with synthetic and historical datasets, before addressing their performance with real-time data which is accruing. A major challenge to overcome for the use of EWSs with disease transitions is to maintain the accuracy of EWSs in data-poor settings. We demonstrate how EWSs behave on reported cases for pertussis in the USA, to highlight some limitations when detecting disease transitions with real-world data.","Southall, Emma; Brett, Tobias S.; Tildesley, Michael J.; Dyson, Louise",J R Soc Interface,148,20

We conducted this prospective study of patients with cancer vaccinated with BNT162b2 and monitored for antibody response and safety. The aim was to evaluate the rate of seropositivity and define predictors for non-reactive immune response. Furthermore, we evaluated the frequency and the severity of adverse events. METHODS: The study included patients with solid tumours undergoing anticancer treatment and immunocompetent health-care workers serving as controls. Serum titres of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) immunoglobulin G (IgG) and neutralising antibodies were measured 2–4 weeks after each vaccine dose. RESULTS: The analysis included 129 patients, of which 70.5% patients were metastatic. Patients were treated with chemotherapy (55%), immunotherapy (34.1%), biological agents (24.8%), hormonal treatment (8.5%) and radiotherapy (4.6%), that were given either alone or in combinations.

RESULTS: 35% of participants were upper 30 years of age, 70.4% were female, 74.4% had no coronavirus infection among their relatives, and 54.7% of them were Ph.D. candidates. The relations between “unclear accountability of events by some officials” and age as well as “failure to provide dissenting viewpoints and critical comments” and age were statistically significant (p=0.027، p=0.014). Moreover the relation between coronavirus infected relative and “persistent beliefs” was statistically significant (p= 0.014).

Cities in China and India after 1 week of lockdown recorded an average drop in AQI(PM2.5) and AQI(NO2) of 11.32% and 48.61% and 20.21% and 59.26%, respectively. The results indicate that the drop in AQI(NO2) was instantaneous as compared with the gradual drop in AQI(PM2.5). The lockdown in China and India led to a final drop in AQI(PM2.5) of 45.25% and 64.65% and in AQI(NO2) of 37.42% and 65.80%, respectively. This study will assist the policymakers in devising a pathway to curb down air pollutant concentration in various urban cities by utilising the benchmark levels of air pollution.","Agarwal, Aviral; Kaushik, Aman; Kumar, Sankalp; Mishra, Rajeev Kumar",Air Qual Atmos Health,148,20

Aiming to discuss the impact of the COVID-19 on the economic resilience of urban agglomerations, the economic data of each quarter from June 2019 to September 2020 of the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei Urban Agglomeration are selected, and the economic development index (EDI) is calculated based on the entropy method. Combining the fundamental conditions of urban agglomerations and industrial policies during the COVID-19, urban economic resilience is discussed by the changing trend of the economic development index (EDI) and dividing into resistance and restoration. The results show that: (1) The economic development level of the urban agglomeration has been affected by the epidemic and has changed significantly. The change of endogenous power is the main cause of change; (2) During the outbreak of the COVID-19, the economic resilience of the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei urban agglomeration shows four different development types: high resistance and restoration, high resistance but low restoration, low resistance but high restoration, low resistance and restoration cities; (3) High resistance but low restoration, low resistance but high restoration, and low resistance and restoration cities influence each other, but the relationship between cities is mainly dependent; (4) The economic restoration within the urban agglomeration forms a synergy, which promotes the economic recovery and development of the urban agglomeration during the recovery period of the COVID-19. Urban agglomerations should enhance the combined effect of resistance and increase the impact of high resistance and restoration cities on surrounding cities in the future.","Zhang, Yaping; Zhang, Jianjun; Wang, Ke; Wu, Xia",Int J Environ Res Public Health,148,10

Publicly funded systems around the world are grappling with how to best integrate this more accurate but costly technology, as there is limited evidence about its incremental value in real-world conditions. The objectives of this study were to describe the population-based performance of Ontario’s prenatal screening program, which incorporates publicly funded cfDNA screening for specific indications, and the effect of cfDNA testing on the screening and diagnostic choices made by pregnant people. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, descriptive cohort study using routinely collected data from Better Outcomes & Registry Network (BORN) Ontario, which captures linked population data for prenatal and neonatal health encounters across Ontario. We included all singleton pregnancies with an estimated due date between Sept. 1, 2016, and Mar. 31, 2019, that underwent publicly funded prenatal screening in Ontario, and a comparison cohort from Apr. 1, 2012, and Mar. 31, 2013. We assessed performance of the screening program for the detection of T21 or T18 by calculating sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value against diagnostic cytogenetic results or birth outcomes. We assessed the impact of the program by calculating the proportion of T21 screen-positive pregnancies undergoing subsequent cfDNA screening and invasive prenatal diagnostic testing. RESULTS: The study cohort included 373 682 pregnancies. The prenatal screening program had an uptake of 69.9%, a screen-positive rate and sensitivity of 1.6% and 89.9% for T21, and 0.2% and 80.5% for T18, respectively. The test failure rate for cfDNA screening was 2.2%. Invasive prenatal diagnostic testing decreased from 4.4% in 2012–2013 to 2.4% over the study period; 65.2% of pregnant people who received a screen-positive result from cfDNA testing went on to have invasive prenatal diagnostic testing. INTERPRETATION: This publicly funded screening program, incorporating cfDNA analysis for common aneuploidies, showed robust performance, a substantial reduction in invasive prenatal diagnostic testing and that pregnant people exercise autonomy in their choices about prenatal screening and diagnosis.","Dougan, Shelley D.; Okun, Nan; Bellai-Dussault, Kara; Meng, Lynn; Howley, Heather E.; Huang, Tianhua; Reszel, Jessica; Lanes, Andrea; Walker, Mark C.; Armour, Christine M.",CMAJ,148,16

Although the primary tumours are surgically removed, the effects of perioperative hyperoxia exposure on distal micro-metastases and on circulating cancer cells can potentially play a role in cancer progression or recurrence. In clinical trials, hyperoxia seems to increase the rate of postoperative complications and, by delaying postoperative recovery, it can alter the return to intended oncological treatment. The effects of supplemental oxygen on the long-term mortality of surgical cancer patients offer, at this point, conflicting results. In experimental studies, hyperoxia effects on cancer biology were explored following multiple pathways. In cancer cell cultures and animal models, hyperoxia increases the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increases the oxidative stress. These can be followed by the induction of the expression of Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and other molecules involved in angiogenesis and by the promotion of various degrees of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT).","Ristescu, Anca Irina; Tiron, Crina Elena; Tiron, Adrian; Grigoras, Ioana",Biomedicines,148,20

La pandemia por la COVID-19 ha generado un descenso en las consultas a urgencias, pudiendo conllevar un retraso en la atención sanitaria y un aumento en la gravedad de las patologías. El objetivo es analizar la tasa de AA complicadas durante la pandemia, en comparación con el mismo periodo del año anterior. MATERIAL Y MÉTODOS: Estudio retrospectivo observacional de cohortes unicéntrico que incluyó a pacientes menores de 14 años atendidos en urgencias con diagnóstico de AA durante los meses de marzo a mayo de 2019 (no pandemia) y 2020 (pandemia). RESULTADOS: Se incluyeron 90 pacientes (41 en no pandemia y 49 en pandemia). No se encontraron diferencias en el tiempo desde el inicio de la clínica hasta la consulta en urgencias entre los dos períodos (37 h vs 38 h, p=0,881), pero sí en el tiempo desde la llegada a urgencias hasta la intervención quirúrgica (7:00 h vs 10:30 h; p=0,004). La diferencia se acentuó al comparar el mes de marzo con abril-mayo de 2020 (6h vs 12h; p=0,001). No se observaron diferencias significativas en la tasa de AA complicadas en el diagnóstico intraoperatorio (35% vs 33%; p=0,870) ni anatomopatólogico (35% vs 48%; p=0,222), ni tampoco en el número de complicaciones postoperatorias, duración de ingreso y reingresos. Se objetivó un aumento del diagnóstico anatomopatológico de AA con periapendicitis (47% vs 81%; p=0,001) CONCLUSIÓN: Durante la pandemia se observó una demora desde la llegada a urgencias hasta la intervención quirúrgica en niños diagnosticados de AA. Esta demora se tradujo en un incremento del diagnóstico de AA evolucionadas histológicamente, pero sin objetivarse un aumento de las complicaciones de la enfermedad. INTRODUCTION: Acute appendicitis (AA) is the most frequent urgent surgical pathology in pediatrics. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a decrease in emergency department (ED) visits, which can lead to a delay in health care and an increase in the severity of the pathologies. The objective is to analyze the rate of complicated AA during the pandemic, compared to the same period of the previous year. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective unicenter observational cohort study that included patients under 14 years of age seen in the ED with a diagnosis of AA during the months of March to May 2019 (non-pandemic) and 2020 (pandemic). RESULTS: 90 patients were included (41 in non-pandemic and 49 in pandemic). No difference was found between the two periods in the time from the clinic onset until the visit to the ED (37 h vs 38 h, p=0.881), but there was a difference in the time from arrival at the ED until the surgery (7:00 h vs 10:30 h, p=0.004). The difference was accentuated when comparing the month of March with April-May 2020 (6h vs 12h; p=0.001). No significant differences were observed in the rate of complicated AA in intraoperative diagnosis (35% vs 33%; p=0.870) or anatomopathology (35% vs 48%; p=0.222), nor in the number of postoperative complications, length of hospitalization and readmissions. An increase in the anatomopathological diagnosis of AA with periapendicitis was observed (47% vs 81%; p=0.001) CONCLUSION: During the pandemic, a delay from arrival at the ED until the surgery was observed in children diagnosed with AA. This delay resulted in an increase in the diagnosis of histologically evolved AA, but without an increase in the clinical complications of the disease.","Bonilla, Leire; Gálvez, Carmen; Medrano, Lara; Benito, Javier",An Pediatr (Barc),148,20

We aimed to provide COVID-19-specific guidance using the European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation/European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition guidelines for comparison. DESIGN: We convened a RAND appropriateness panel comprising 14 paediatric gastroenterologists and paediatric experts in surgery, rheumatology, respiratory and infectious diseases. Panellists rated the appropriateness of interventions for ASC in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results were discussed at a moderated meeting prior to a second survey. RESULTS: Panellists recommended patients with ASC have a SARS-CoV-2 swab and expedited biological screening on admission and should be isolated. A positive swab should trigger discussion with a COVID-19 specialist. Sigmoidoscopy was recommended prior to escalation to second-line therapy or colectomy. Methylprednisolone was considered appropriate first-line management in all, including those with symptomatic COVID-19. Thromboprophylaxis was also recommended in all. In patients requiring second-line therapy, infliximab was considered appropriate irrespective of SARS-CoV-2 status. Delaying colectomy due to SARS-CoV-2 infection was considered inappropriate. Corticosteroid tapering over 8–10 weeks was deemed appropriate for all. After successful corticosteroid rescue, thiopurine maintenance was rated appropriate in patients with negative SARS-CoV-2 swab and asymptomatic patients with positive swab but uncertain in symptomatic COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Our COVID-19-specific adaptations to paediatric ASC guidelines using a RAND panel generally support existing recommendations, particularly the use of corticosteroids and escalation to infliximab, irrespective of SARS-CoV-2 status. Consideration of routine prophylactic anticoagulation was recommended.","Hansen, Richard; Meade, Susanna; Beattie, R Mark; Auth, Marcus KH; Croft, Nick; Davies, Philip; Devadason, David; Docherty, Conor; Epstein, Jenny; Howarth, Lucy; Kiparissi, Fevronia; Muhammed, Rafeeq; Shivamurthy, Vinay; Spray, Christine; Stanton, Michael P; Torrente, Franco; Urs, Arun; Wilson, David; Irving, Peter M; Samaan, Mark; Kammermeier, Jochen",Gut,148,1

Several internal and external factors can affect acne occurrence and severity. Outdoor air pollution is an external factor discussed to trigger inflammation of the skin. The objective of this study was to find a link between the exposure to ambient air pollution and inflammatory acne occurrence in the Lebanese adult population. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted, using an online questionnaire to collect the required data from different Lebanese regions. The survey covered pollution exposure questions as well as queries on several factors known to have a role on acne occurrence. RESULTS: A total of 372 participants were included in the study, aged 18 to 55 years old. The results of a logistic regression taking the presence/absence of acne as the dependent variable, showed that female gender (aOR = 4.39), younger age (aOR = 1.05), using hydrating cream (aOR = 4.30), working near a power plant vs not (aOR = 3.07), having a severe NO2 exposure compared to none (aOR = 8.24), a higher number of family members with acne or history of acne (aOR = 1.48) were significantly associated with higher odds of having acne, whereas having a dry skin compared to normal (aOR = 0.20) was significantly associated with lower odds of having acne. CONCLUSION: The occurrence of inflammatory acne in Lebanese adults was found to be associated with ambient exposure to high levels of NO(2) and employment near a power plant known to emit CO(2), CO, SO(2), NO(2) and PM. Therefore, our findings can serve as a first step towards implementing awareness on a skin care routine suitable for highly polluted areas.

Methods Data of 43,995 Brazilian adults from a cross-sectional, nationwide behavior research were used. Participants reported the frequency on loneliness, sadness (feel sad, crestfallen or depressed) and anxiety (feel worried, anxious or nervous) feelings during the pandemic period. Frequency and duration of physical activity as well as duration of TV-viewing before and during the pandemic period were also reported. We created four categories of reported changes in physical activity (1-consistently active, 2-become active, 3-become inactive or 4-consistently inactive) and TV-viewing (1-consistently high, 2-become low, 3-become high or 4-consistently high). Participants also reported previous diagnoses of depression [yes (PD) or no (nPD). Logistic regression models separating people with and without depression were created. Results Compared to consistently active participants, to become inactive during the pandemic was associated with a higher odds for loneliness [nPD:OR:1.32 (95%CI,1.02–1.70); PD:2.22 (1.21–4.06)], sadness [nPD:1.34 (1.01–1.77); PD:2.88 (1.54–5.36)], and anxiety [nPD:1.71 (1.30–2.25); PD:2.55 (1.20–5.42)]. Also, people with depression and consistently physically inactive presented higher odds for loneliness and sadness. Compared to consistently low TV-viewing, participants that become with high TV-viewing showed higher odds for loneliness [nPD:1.59 (1.37–1.86)], sadness [nPD:1.68 (1.44–1.96); PD:1.61 (1.21 to 2.15)] and anxiety [nPD:1.73 (1.48–2.02); PD:1.58 (1.12–2.23)]. Conclusions Reported increases in physical inactivity and TV-viewing during the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with poorer mental health indicators.

Among the respondents, 42% of MCI, 54.3% of AD and 72.7% of DLB patients had a decline in MMSE scores and 54.4% of DLB patients had worsening Neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI) scores. Patients with DLB showed a more rapid decline of MMSE than those with AD. Diminished physical activity and social contact might have hastened the deterioration of cognition and the worsening of NPS. Conclusion: Social isolation and physical inactivity even after strict lockdown for at least 6 months were correlated with accelerated decline of cognitive function and NPS in patients with AD and DLB.","Chen, Zhi-Chao; Liu, Shuai; Gan, Jinghuan; Ma, Lingyun; Du, Xiaoshan; Zhu, Han; Han, Jiuyan; Xu, Junying; Wu, Hao; Fei, Min; Dou, Yuchao; Yang, Yaqi; Deng, Peng; Wang, Xiao-Dan; Ji, Yong",Front Psychiatry,148,16

Filamentous and pleomorphic viruses lack such global symmetry but their surface proteins may display locally ordered assemblies. Determining the structures of enveloped viruses, including the envelope proteins and their protein-protein interactions on the viral surface, is of paramount importance. These structures can reveal how the virions are assembled and released by budding from the infected host cell, how the progeny virions infect new cells by membrane fusion, and how antibodies bind surface epitopes to block infection.

Thus, we argue that properties of the Bitcoin market are mostly time dependent. We examine efficiency-related measures: the Hurst exponent, multifractal degree, and kurtosis.

Presentamos todos los casos de neumomediastino espontáneo hallados en nuestro hospital entre enero de 1996 y diciembre de 2004. Para ello, elaboramos un protocolo de recogida de datos que incluyó: antecedentes personales, desencadenantes, semiología, radiología, tratamiento, estancia y complicaciones. En este período diagnosticamos 36 casos —25 varones (69,4%) y 11 mujeres (27,5%)—, con una edad media de 36,8 años (rango: 11-90) y estancia media de 8,56 días (rango: 1-53). El cuadro clínico más habitual fue el dolor torácico, aislado (27%) o asociado a disnea (19,4%). En 14 pacientes (38,8%) hubo factor desencadenante. No hubo morbimortalidad asociada al proceso. Por todo ello, se concluye que el neumomediastino espontáneo es una entidad infrecuente, con gran variabilidad clínica, cuyo diagnóstico correcto exige un alto índice de sospecha, y la radiografía de tórax es la prueba idónea para ello. Spontaneous pneumomediastinum is defined as a primary process characterized by the presence of air or gas in the mediastinum. We report all the cases of spontaneous pneumomediastinum diagnosed in our hospital between January 1996 and December 2004. We developed a protocol for data collection that included the following: medical history, triggers, signs, radiology, treatment, hospital stay, and complications. During this period we diagnosed 36 cases—25 men (69.4%) and 11 women (27.5%)—with a mean age of 36.8 years (range, 11-90 years) and a mean hospital stay of 8.56 days (range, 1-53 days). The most common clinical presentation was chest pain, either isolated (27%) or with associated dyspnea (19.4%). A triggering factor was identified for 14 patients (38.8%). There was no associated morbidity or mortality. In view of our findings, we concluded that spontaneous pneumomediastinum is an uncommon entity with considerable clinical variability and that correct diagnosis requires a high level of suspicion. Radiography provides the best evidence for diagnosis.","Campillo-Soto, A.; Coll-Salinas, A.; Soria-Aledo, V.; Blanco-Barrio, A.; Flores-Pastor, B.; Candel-Arenas, M.; Aguayo-Albasini, J.

The doe needs to be properly vaccinated before kidding, be in proper body condition, and have good nutrition, including vitamins and minerals. A program to prevent caprine arthritis encephalitis must be instituted, which involves removal of the kid from the doe at birth, feeding heat treated colostrum the first day of life, and feeding with milk replacer, heat treated milk, or a mixture thereafter. Milk should be fed generously (3 times a day) to 2 weeks of life. Milk consumption can become limited by feeding 0.5 l per feeding, twice a day. More milk can be fed, by feeding 3 times a day or using acidified or cold milk procedures. A high-quality starter feed should be fed beginning the second week of life. A kid must be a minimum of 6 weeks of age to be weaned, weigh at least 10 kg, and have a starter intake of at least 250 g day(-1). Kids can be transitioned to weaning by reducing milk feeding to one time a day. After weaning, the kid should be fed 360 g of starter feed per day and all of the high-quality hay they can eat. The kid should gain 150 g day(-1) from birth and weigh 35 kg by 7 months of age when they can be bred. Kid health problems can be prevented by consumption of adequate colostrum, well-ventilated environment, avoiding crowding, and good sanitation.

Aggravation of COVID-19 is closely related to the secondary systemic inflammatory response. Glucocorticoids are used to control severe diseases caused by the cytokine storm, owing to their anti-inflammatory effects. However, glucocorticoids are a double-edged sword, as the use of large doses has the potential risk of secondary infection and long-term serious complications, and may prolong virus clearance time. Nonetheless, the risks and benefits of glucocorticoid adjuvant therapy for COVID-19 are inconclusive. AIM: To determine the effect of methylprednisolone in severe and critically ill patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This single-center retrospective study included 102 adult COVID-19 patients admitted to a ward of a designated hospital in Wuhan, Hubei Province from January to March 2020. All patients received general symptomatic treatment and organ function support, and were given different respiratory support measures according to their conditions. In case of deterioration, considering the hyperinflammatory state of the patients, methylprednisolone was intravenously administered at 0.75-1.5 mg/kg/d, usually for less than 14 d. Patient vital signs and oxygenation were closely monitored, in combination with imaging and routine blood tests such as C-reactive protein, biochemical indicators (liver and kidney function, myocardial enzymes, electrolytes, etc.), and coagulation function. Patient clinical outcomes were discharge or death. RESULTS: A total of 102 severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients were included in this study. They were divided into treatment (69, 67.6%) and control groups (33, 32.4%) according to methylprednisolone use. Comparison of baseline data between the two groups showed that the treatment group patients had higher aspartic acid aminotransferase, globulin, hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, and lactate dehydrogenase. There was no significant difference in other baseline data between the two groups. With regard to prognosis, 29 (78.4%) patients in the treatment group died as opposed to 40 (61.5%) in the control group. The mortality was higher in the treatment group than in the control group; however, according to the log-rank test and the Kaplan–Meier survival curve, the difference in mortality between both groups was insignificant (P = 0.655). The COX regression equation was used to correct the variables with differences, and the results showed that methylprednisolone treatment did not improve prognosis. CONCLUSION: Methylprednisolone treatment does not improve prognosis in severe and critical COVID-19 patients.","Zhu, Hong-Ming; Li, Yan; Li, Bang-Yi; Yang, Shuang; Peng, Ding; Yang, Xiaojiao; Sun, Xue-Lian; Zhang, Mei",World J Clin Cases,148,9

Chi square test was used to compare categorical variables, and univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were conducted.Of the 2045 participants,1136 (65.6%) were considered to have moderate and severe anxiety symptoms, and 865(42.3%) had moderate and severe depression symptoms. Based on the logistic regression models, the prevalence of anxiety was higher in the females than in the males (OR=1.4, 95% CI: 1.123-1.643, P=.002); the prevalence of anxiety was significantly higher in those aged 30-39 years than in other age groups (OR=1.6, 95% CI: 1.123-2.320, P=0.001); furthermore, the prevalence of anxiety and depression was significantly higher in doctors and nurses compared with other occupations (OR=1.9, 95% CI: 1.367-2.491, P< 0.001) and(OR=1.5, 95% CI: 1.154-2.021, P=0.003). In addition, the prevalence of anxiety symptoms in the likely-infected COVID-19 group was higher than in the noninfected COVID-19 group (OR=1.35, 95% CI: 1.093-1.654, P=0.005).A majority of health workers and general population have anxiety and depression symptoms. These symptoms are more widespread in doctors and nurses in comparison to other occupations, and psychological interventions might be conducive to reducing the negative symptoms.","Taghizadeh, F.; Hassannia, L.; Moosazadeh, M.; Zarghami, M.; Taghizadeh, H.; Fathi Dooki, A.; Alizadeh Navaei, R.; Hedayatizadeh-Omran, A.",,148,20

Using a discrete choice experiment, we invited participants to make a series of choices between policy scenarios aimed at relaxing the lockdown, which were specified not in terms of their nature (e.g. whether or not to allow schools to re-open) but in terms of their effects along seven dimensions. These included health-related effects, but also impacts on the economy, education, and personal income. From the observed choices, we were able to infer the implicit trade-offs made by the Dutch between these policy effects. For example, we find that the average citizen, in order to avoid one fatality directly or indirectly related to COVID-19, is willing to accept a lasting lag in the educational performance of 18 children, or a lasting (>3 years) and substantial (>15%) reduction in net income of 77 households. We explore heterogeneity across individuals in terms of these trade-offs by means of latent class analysis. Our results suggest that most citizens are willing to trade-off health-related and other effects of the lockdown, implying a consequentialist ethical perspective. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that the elderly, known to be at relatively high risk of being affected by the virus, are relatively reluctant to sacrifice economic pain and educational disadvantages for the younger generation, to avoid fatalities. We also identify a so-called taboo trade-off aversion amongst a substantial share of our sample, being an aversion to accept morally problematic policies that simultaneously imply higher fatality numbers and lower taxes. We explain various ways in which our results can be of value to policy makers in the context of the COVID-19 and future pandemics.","Chorus, Caspar; Sandorf, Erlend Dancke; Mouter, Niek",PLoS One,148,16

This has led to the postulation that administering BCG before unrelated vaccines may enhance responses to these vaccines. This might also model effects of BCG on unrelated infections. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: To test this hypothesis, we have designed a randomised controlled trial of BCG versus no BCG immunisation to determine the effect of BCG on subsequent unrelated vaccines, among 300 adolescents (aged 13–17 years) from a Ugandan birth cohort. Our schedule will comprise three main immunisation days (week 0, week 4 and week 28): BCG (or no BCG) revaccination at week 0; yellow fever (YF-17D), oral typhoid (Ty21a) and human papillomavirus (HPV) prime at week 4; and HPV boost and tetanus/diphtheria (Td) boost at week 28. Primary outcomes are anti-YF-17D neutralising antibody titres, Salmonella typhi lipopolysaccharide-specific IgG concentration, IgG specific for L1-proteins of HPV-16/HPV-18 and tetanus and diphtheria toxoid-specific IgG concentration, all assessed at 4 weeks after immunisation with YF, Ty21a, HPV and Td, respectively. Secondary analyses will determine effects on correlates of protective immunity (where recognised correlates exist), on vaccine response waning and on whether there are differential effects on priming versus boosting immunisations. We will also conduct exploratory immunology assays among subsets of participants to further characterise effects of BCG revaccination on vaccine responses. Further analyses will assess which life course exposures influence vaccine responses in adolescence. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval has been obtained from relevant Ugandan and UK ethics committees. Results will be shared with Uganda Ministry of Health, relevant district councils, community leaders and study participants. Further dissemination will be done through conference proceedings and publications.

Materials and Methods: This systematic review was carried out based on the Preferred Reporting Items for a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). Three databases were analyzed (Pubmed, Web of science and Scopus) by three independent researchers. From the 18 identified studies, 10 of them met the inclusion criteria. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 or its entry factors (angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2), transmembrane serine proteases (TMPRSS), and furin) was analyzed in these 10 studies during the pandemic. Results: ACE2 expression was analyzed in 9 of the 10 studies. ACE2 is expressed mainly in the tongue, oral mucosa, salivary glands and epithelial cells. The expression of the TMPRSS2 gene or protein was analyzed in 6 studies. These studies reported that the expression of TMPRSS2 was mainly in the salivary glands, tongue, sulcular epithelium and oral mucosa; as well as in cells of the salivary glands (ductal, acinar and myoepithelial cells) and the tongue (the spinous-based cell layer, horny layer and the epithelial surface). Other TMPRSS were also reported. The expression of TMPRSS3, TMPRSS4, TMPRSS5, TMPRSS7 and TMPRSS11D was reported mainly in salivary glands and in epithelial-type cells. Furan expression was analyzed in three studies. The expression of furin was detected mainly in epithelial cells of the tongue. A variety of methods were used to carry out the detection of SARS-CoV-2 or its input molecules. Conclusions: These results show that SARS-CoV-2 can infect a wide variety of oral tissues and cells, and that together with the theories dedicated to explaining the oral symptoms present in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, it provides us with a good scientific basis for understanding the virus infection in the oral cavity and its consequences.","Salas Orozco, Marco Felipe; Niño-Martínez, Nereyda; Martínez-Castañón, Gabriel-Alejandro; Patiño Marín, Nuria; Sámano Valencia, Carolina; Dipp Velázquez, Farid Alonso; Sosa Munguía, Paulina del Carmen; Casillas Santana, Miguel Angel",Medicina (Kaunas),148,26

We sought to determine the age-specific rates of COVID-19 mortality at the population level. METHODS: We obtained information regarding the total number of COVID-19 reported deaths for six consecutive weeks beginning at the 50th recorded death, among 16 countries that reported a relatively high number of COVID-19 cases as of April 12, 2020. We performed an ecological study to model COVID-19 mortality rates per week by age group (54 years or younger, 55–64 years, and 65 years or older) and sex using a Poisson mixed effects regression model. RESULTS: Over the six-week period of data, there were 178,568 COVID-19 deaths from a total population of approximately 2.4 billion people. Age and sex were associated with COVID-19 mortality. Compared with individuals ages 54 years or younger, the incident rate ratio (IRR) was 8.1, indicating that the mortality rate of COVID-19 was 8.1 times higher (95%CI = 7.7, 8.5) among those 55 to 64 years, and more than 62 times higher (IRR = 62.1; 95%CI = 59.7, 64.7) among those ages 65 or older. Mortality rates from COVID-19 were 77% higher in men than in women (IRR = 1.77, 95%CI = 1.74, 1.79).

Japan has faced three epidemic “waves” of COVID-19 from early 2020 through early 2021. Here we narratively review the three waves in Japan, describe the key epidemiologic features of COVID-19, and discuss lessons learned. METHODS: We assessed publicly available surveillance data, routine surveillance reports, and other relevant sources―multiple indicators were monitored to improve interpretation of surveillance data. Weekly trends for each wave were described based on the number of case notifications; number of tests performed; proportion of those tests that were positive for the novel coronavirus; the prevalent number of COVID-19 hospitalizations (total hospitalizations and those categorized as severe); and number of COVID-19 deaths. For each indicator and wave, we recorded the first calendar week to show an increase over two consecutive previous weeks, along with the peak week. RESULTS: The spring wave was characterized by detection of cases imported from China, followed by notifications of sporadic cases without travel history, clusters, and mild/asymptomatic cases. The summer wave saw a large increase in notifications and a younger age distribution, but in the context of increased testing with lower test positivity. The winter wave brought considerable morbidity and mortality, surpassing the cumulative case counts and fatalities from the earlier waves, with high peak values. Overall, relative to the first wave, the burden of severe outcomes was lower in the second and higher in the third wave, but varied by prefecture. In all three waves, severe outcomes peaked after notification counts and test positivity peaked; severe outcomes were also consistently skewed toward the elderly. CONCLUSIONS: Important lessons were learned from each wave and across waves―some aspects remained constant, while others changed over time. In order to rapidly detect an increase in incidence, continuous, timely, and sensitive surveillance―using multiple information sources with careful interpretations―will be key in COVID-19 control.","Arima, Yuzo; Kanou, Kazuhiko; Arashiro, Takeshi; K Ko, Yura; Otani, Kanako; Tsuchihashi, Yuuki; Takahashi, Takuri; Miyahara, Reiko; Sunagawa, Tomimasa; Suzuki, Motoi",JMA J,148,26

For this purpose we propose a scaling model that can have general applicability in the understanding of real data of epidemics. This is analogous to the finite-size scaling, a technique used in the literature of phase transition to identify universality classes. In the disease model, the size of a system is proportional to the volume of the population, within a geographical region, that have been infected at the death of the epidemic or are eventually going to be infected when an epidemic ends. Outcome of our study, for COVID-19, via application of this model, suggests that in most of the countries, after the `onset' of spread, the growths are described by rapid exponential function, for significantly long periods. In addition to accurately identifying this superuniversal feature, we point out that the model is helpful in grouping countries into universality classes, based on the late time behavior, characterized by physical distancing practices, in a natural way. This feature of the model can provide direct comparative understanding of the effectiveness of lockdown-like social measures adopted in different places.","Das, S. K.",,148,1

In early 2021, a quarter of people in England who believed they could work entirely from home reported attending their workplace. To inform interventions to reduce this, this study examined associated factors. Methods: Data from the ongoing CORSAIR survey series of nationally representative samples of people in the UK aged 16+ years in January-February 2021 were used. The study sample was 1422 respondents who reported that they could work completely from home. The outcome measure was self-reported workplace attendance at least once during the preceding week. Factors of interest were analysed in three blocks: 1) sociodemographic variables, 2) variables relating to circumstances of respondents, and 3) psychological variables. Results: 26.8% (95%CI=24.5%-29.1%) of respondents reported having attended their workplace at least once in the preceding week. Sociodemographic variables and living circumstances significantly independently predicted non-essential workplace attendance: male gender (OR=1.85,95%CI=1.33-2.58), dependent children in the household (OR=1.65,95%CI=1.17-2.32), financial hardship (OR=1.14,95%CI=1.08-1.21), socio-economic grade C2DE (OR=1.74, 95%CI=1.19-2.53), working in sectors such as health or social care (OR=4.18, 95%CI=2.56-6.81), education and childcare (OR=2.45, 95%CI=1.45-4.14) and key public service (OR=3.78, 95%CI=1.83-7.81), and having been vaccinated (OR=2.08,95%CI=1.33-3.24). Conclusions: Non-essential workplace attendance in the UK in early 2021 during the Covid-19 pandemic was significantly independently associated with a range of sociodemographic variables and personal circumstances. Having been vaccinated, financial hardship, socio-economic grade C2DE, having a dependent child at home, working in certain key sectors were associated with higher likelihood of workplace attendance.","Michie, S.; Potts, H.

While protective humoral and cellular immune responses are usually mounted against these betacoronaviruses, immune responses to SARS-CoV2 sometimes derail towards inflammatory tissue damage, leading to rapid admissions to intensive care units. The lack of knowledge on mechanisms that tilt the balance between these two opposite outcomes poses major threats to many ongoing clinical trials dealing with immunostimulatory or immunoregulatory therapeutics. This review will discuss innate and cognate immune responses underlying protective or deleterious immune reactions against these pathogenic coronaviruses.","Melenotte, Cléa; Silvin, Aymeric; Goubet, Anne-Gaëlle; Lahmar, Imran; Dubuisson, Agathe; Zumla, Alimuddin; Raoult, Didier; Merad, Mansouria; Gachot, Bertrand; Hénon, Clémence; Solary, Eric; Fontenay, Michaela; André, Fabrice; Maeurer, Markus; Ippolito, Giuseppe; Piacentini, Mauro; Wang, Fu-Sheng; Ginhoux, Florent; Marabelle, Aurélien; Kroemer, Guido; Derosa, Lisa; Zitvogel, Laurence",Oncoimmunology,148,1

Methods: To reveal predictors for humoral response to BNT162b2 vaccine among RTR, patients were divided to positive (N=42) and negative (N=78) response groups based on receptor-binding domain (RBD) IgG >= 1.1 and neutralizing antibodies (NA) >= 16 dilution versus RBD IgG < 1.1 or NA < 16 respectively. NA were detected using a SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-virus. Results: NA were detected in only 42/120 (35%) of RTR vs. 197/202 (97.5%) immunocompetent controls (p < 0.001). NA geometric mean titers (GMTs) in RTR were significantly lower vs. the control group [83.7 (95% CI 50.5-138.8) vs. 482 (95% CI 411-566), p < 0.001]. In a multivariable analysis, mycophenolic acid (MPA) dose and hemoglobin (Hb) level were found to be independent predictors for antibody response in RTR. A positive response rate of 27% vs. 63% was observed in patients on and off MPA, respectively. An increase in MPA dose by 1 mg/kg weight reduced the odds for a positive response by 17% (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.75-0.92, p<0.001). GMTs for RBD IgG were significantly reduced as MPA daily dose increased. Hb blood level < 13 g/dL reduced the antibody response by 63% (p=0.04). Pain at the injection site after the second vaccine dose was significantly higher in the responders vs. nonresponders (20.5% vs. 5.5%, p=0.01). Conclusions: Only 35% of RTR develop NA to the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. MPA is a major suppressor of antibody response in RTR.","Hod, Tammy; Ben-David, Aharon; Olmer, Liraz; Levy, Itzchak; Ghinea, Ronen; Mor, Eytan; Lustig, Yaniv; Rahav, Galia",Transplantation,148,1

The initial cellulose microfibers (CEL) were activated by (3-aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APTES), and then covalently modified by polyglutamic acid (PGA) and mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN), obtaining the microfibers CEL-PGA-MSN. Owing to the electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged components (i.e., PGA and MSN) and positively charged amino acids of the epitope of EV71 capsid protein VP2 (VP2-ep), the obtained microfibers strongly adsorbed the epitope, and exhibited high EV71-adsorption capacity.

However, early prophylactic or unreasonable use of antibiotics promotes drug resistance in bacteria and also delays optimum treatment. To explore genomic evidence of rational antibiotic use in intensive care units, we isolated Klebsiella pneumoniae from IPN samples that showed the highest positive-culture rate in 758 patients. Based on whole-genome sequencing from eight strains, 42 antibiotic-resistant genes were identified in the chromatin and 27 in the plasmid, which included classic resistance-mechanism factors such as β-lactamases [16.67% (7/42) in the chromatin and 25.93% (7/27) in the plasmid]. The K. pneumoniae isolates were identified to be resistant to multiple antibiotics used in clinics. In vivo and in vitro, ceftazidime-avibactam (CZA) plus aztreonam (ATM) (2.5:1) showed more significant antibacterial effectiveness than CZA alone. The isolated K. pneumoniae were of three different types according to the resistance phenotypes for CZA and ATM. Those co-harboring bla(NDM–5), bla(CTX–M–15), bla(OXA–1), and bla(SHV–187) showed higher resistance to CAZ than bla(NDM–5). Those co-harboring bla(CTX–M–65), bla(SHV–182), and bla(TEM–181) were significantly less resistant to β-lactam than to other extended-spectrum β-lactamases. However, β-lactamases were inhibited by avibactam (AVI), except for NDM-5. ATM plus AVI showed a significant inhibitory effect on K. pneumoniae, and the minimum dosage of ATM was < 1 mg/L. In conclusion, we propose that ATM plus AVI could be a major therapy for complex infectious diseases caused by multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae.","Hao, Haibin; Liu, Yang; Cao, Jin; Gao, Kun; Lu, Yingying; Wang, Weiping; Wang, Peng; Lu, Sida; Hu, Long; Tong, Zhihui; Li, Weiqin",Front Microbiol,148,20

Neurological manifestations are observed more frequently in patients with coronavirus disease. MAIN TEXT: The aim of the review is to seek evidence for infection of the nervous system by the human coronavirus and study the neurological manifestations of the coronavirus and its treatment. A search was done in PubMed, Google Scholar, CrossRef, and Scopus. There is evidence for the coronavirus infection of the nervous system from experimental studies, autopsy reports, and clinical studies. The virus can damage the nervous system either by direct viral damage to the neural cells or by immunopathology. Cerebral edema, neuronal degeneration, encephalitis, meningoencephalitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, Guillain–Barré Syndrome, Bickerstaff’s brainstem encephalitis, Miller Fisher syndrome, polyneuritis, toxic encephalopathy, and stroke can occur. The coronavirus has been demonstrated in the cerebrospinal fluid by polymerase chain reaction technique in infected patients. The abnormalities of the coagulation system increase the risk of cerebrovascular disease. Chloroquine analogs, lopinavir/ritonavir combination, remdesivir, dexamethasone, and immunoglobulin have been shown to be useful for the treatment. CONCLUSION: There is substantial evidence for infection of the nervous system by the different strains of the human coronavirus. The coronavirus enters the nervous system either by the blood or from the olfactory nerves. The neurological diseases correlate with the severity of the coronavirus disease. The treatment is mainly supportive. The reports of patients with encephalitis, encephalomyelitis, and brainstem encephalitis show slow recovery.

However, polio outbreaks, mainly caused by type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2), are increasing worldwide. Meanwhile, immunodeficiency-associated vaccine-derived poliovirus (iVDPV) is considered another risk factor during the final stage of global polio eradication. Patients with primary immunodeficiency diseases are associated with higher risks for long-term iVDPV infections. Although a limited number of chronic iVDPV excretors were reported, the recent identification of a chronic type 2 iVDPV (iVDPV2) excretor in the Philippines highlights the potential risk of inapparent iVDPV infection for expanding cVDPV outbreaks. Further research on the genetic characterizations and molecular evolution of iVDPV2, based on comprehensive iVDPV surveillance, will be critical for elucidating the remaining risk of iVDPV2 during the post-OPV era.","Kitamura, Kouichi; Shimizu, Hiroyuki",Viruses,148,17

The whole world is eagerly waiting for an effective antiviral therapy to combat COVID-19, but it is yet to get. The emergence of COVID-19 makes imperative the need for safe and potent antiviral drugs. Many metal nanoparticles exhibit significant antiviral potential against many viral diseases. The Ayurvedic system of medicine is the treasure of many metal nanoparticulate drugs termed as Bhasma. RECENT FINDINGS: Gold, silver, copper, zinc and iron oxide nanoparticles are effective against coronavirus. A possible mechanism of action of the metal nanoparticles against coronavirus is a disruption of outer layers of coronavirus. Swarna Bhasma, Rajata Bhasma, Tamra Bhasma and Yashada Bhasma are recommended for COVID-19 treatment due to the ability to reduce the plasma interleukins, interferons and TNFα levels. SUMMARY: The Ayurvedic Bhasma preparations are unique metal nanoparticles. These metal nanoparticles are safe, stable in solid state and are having excellent biological activities. Ayurvedic metal nanoparticles, Swarna Bhasma, Rajata Bhasma, Tamra Bhasma and Yashada Bhasma could be proved as novel antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2 for their anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antiviral and adjuvant activities.","Sarkar, Prasanta Kumar; Das Mukhopadhyay, Chitrangada",Int Nano Lett,148,16

In this study, we explored the epidemiological characteristics, clinical patterns, and laboratory and imaging findings of pediatric patients with COVID-19. Materials and Methods From March 7 to March 30, 2020, there were a total of 35 patients who had confirmed COVID-19 infection by laboratory virus nucleic acid test (RT-PCR) assay with throat swab samples or typical chest CT manifestation compatible with COVID-19, in addition to a history of close contact with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 in family members. Information recorded included demographic data, medical history, exposure history, underlying comorbidities, symptoms, signs, laboratory findings and radiologic assessments, severity of disease, treatment, and mortality. Results The median age of the patients was 7.5 years (IQR=4-11; range=4 months to 15 years). A total of 63% were male. Cough was present in 80% of the patients, followed by fever (77%), nausea or vomiting (29%), diarrhea (26%), shortness of breath (29%), headache (20%), and myalgia (14%). Lymphopenia was present in 43% of the patients, thrombocytopenia in 9%, neutopenia in 8%, and leucopenia in 26%. We reported severe pneumonia in 40% of the hospitalized patients and 18 (51%) had underlying diseases. Of 35 patients, 11 had positive RT-PCR results (31%). The chest CT images of 24 patients (69%) suggested COVID-19, while their RT-PCR assays from throat swab samples were negative. Conclusion This study demonstrates different clinical findings of pediatrics compared to the previous reports of children. Since a high rate of false negative RT-PCR test was observed, early detection of children with COVID-19 infection by CT is conducive to reasonable management and early treatment.","Mahmoudi, Shima; Mehdizadeh, Mehrzad; Shervin Badv, Reza; Navaeian, Amene; Pourakbari, Babak; Rostamyan, Maryam; Sharifzadeh Ekbatani, Meisam; Eshaghi, Hamid; Abdolsalehi, Mohammad Reza; Alimadadi, Hosein; Movahedi, Zahra; Mamishi, Setareh",Infection and drug resistance,148,1

The virus causing SARS was identified as a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and multiple genomic sequences have been revealed since mid-April, 2003. After a quiet summer and fall in 2003, the newly emerged SARS cases in Asia, particularly the latest cases in China, are reinforcing a wide-spread belief that the SARS epidemic would strike back. With the understanding that SARS-CoV might be with humans for years to come, knowledge of the evolutionary mechanism of the SARS-CoV, including its mutation rate and emergence time, is fundamental to battle this deadly pathogen. To date, the speed at which the deadly virus evolved in nature and the elapsed time before it was transmitted to humans remains poorly understood. RESULTS: Sixteen complete genomic sequences with available clinical histories during the SARS outbreak were analyzed. After careful examination of multiple-sequence alignment, 114 single nucleotide variations were identified. To minimize the effects of sequencing errors and additional mutations during the cell culture, three strategies were applied to estimate the mutation rate by 1) using the closely related sequences as background controls; 2) adjusting the divergence time for cell culture; or 3) using the common variants only. The mutation rate in the SARS-CoV genome was estimated to be 0.80 – 2.38 × 10(-3 )nucleotide substitution per site per year which is in the same order of magnitude as other RNA viruses. The non-synonymous and synonymous substitution rates were estimated to be 1.16 – 3.30 × 10(-3 )and 1.67 – 4.67 × 10(-3 )per site per year, respectively. The most recent common ancestor of the 16 sequences was inferred to be present as early as the spring of 2002. CONCLUSIONS: The estimated mutation rates in the SARS-CoV using multiple strategies were not unusual among coronaviruses and moderate compared to those in other RNA viruses. All estimates of mutation rates led to the inference that the SARS-CoV could have been with humans in the spring of 2002 without causing a severe epidemic.","Zhao, Zhongming; Li, Haipeng; Wu, Xiaozhuang; Zhong, Yixi; Zhang, Keqin; Zhang, Ya-Ping; Boerwinkle, Eric; Fu, Yun-Xin",BMC Evol Biol,148,16

The data set consists of MCF7 which is a human breast cancer cell line with estrogen, progesterone and glucocorticoid receptors. The cell lines treated with different quantities of Cissampelos pareira (Cipa). Cipa is a traditional medicinal plant which would possess an antiviral potency in preventing viral diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. METHODS: Utilizing Biobase, GEOquery, gplots packages in R studio, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. The gene ontology (GO) of pathway enrichments employed by utilizing DAVID and KEGG enrichment analyses were studied. We further constructed a human protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and performed, based upon that, a subnetwork module analysis for significant signaling pathways. RESULTS: The study identified 418 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using bioinformatics tools. The gene ontology of pathway enrichments employed by GO and KEGG enrichment analyses of down-regulated and up-regulated DEGs were studied. Gene expression analysis utilizing gene ontology and KEGG results uncovered biological and signaling pathways such as “cell adhesion molecules”, “plasma membrane adhesion molecules”, “synapse assembly”, and “Interleukin-3-mediated signaling” which are mostly linked to COVID-19.

A quantitative method was adopted asking participants who were engaged in physical activity or mindfulness to fill a battery of measures of depression and resilience and some demographic questions. The results showed that mindfulness practice strengthened the initial level of resilience of practitioners, suggesting that mindfulness meditation is a tool for coping with adversity during a potentially traumatic event. Conversely, physical activity practitioners maintained a stable resilience score over time, suggesting that exposure to adversity did not disrupt their state of biopsychospiritual homeostasis.

This fact has become evident in the ongoing research of the association between the environment and the evolution of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, in light of the hundreds of contradictory studies that have already been published on this issue in just a few months. In this paper, a COVID-19 dataset containing the number of daily cases registered in the regions of Catalonia (Spain) since the start of the pandemic to the end of August 2020 is analysed using statistical models of diverse levels of complexity. Specifically, the possible effect of several environmental variables (solar exposure, mean temperature, and wind speed) on the number of cases is assessed. Thus, the first objective of the paper is to show how the choice of a certain type of statistical model to conduct the analysis can have a severe impact on the associations that are inferred between the covariates and the response variable. Secondly, it is shown how the use of spatio-temporal models accounting for the nature of the data allows understanding the evolution of the pandemic in space and time.

The presence of underlying cardiovascular risk factors and established cardiovascular disease (CVD) may affect the severity and clinical management of patients with COVID-19. We conducted a review of the literature to summarize the cardiovascular pathophysiology, risk factors, clinical presentations, and treatment considerations of COVID-19 patients with underlying CVD. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as a functional receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and it is associated with the cardiovascular system. Hypertension, diabetes, and CVD are the most common comorbidities in COVID-19 patients, and these factors have been associated with the progression and severity of COVID-19. However, elderly populations, who develop more-severe COVID-19 complications, are naturally exposed to these comorbidities, underscoring the possible confounding of age. Observational data support international cardiovascular societies’ recommendations to not discontinue ACE inhibitor/angiotensin-receptor blocker therapy in patients with guideline indications for fear of the increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, severe disease, or death. In addition to the cardiotoxicity of experimental antivirals and potential interactions of experimental therapies with cardiovascular drugs, several strategies for cardiovascular protection have been recommended in COVID-19 patients with underlying CVD. Troponin elevation is associated with increased risk of in-hospital mortality and adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Cardiovascular care teams should have a high index of suspicion for fulminant myocarditis-like presentations being SARS-CoV-2 positive, and remain vigilant for cardiovascular complications in COVID-19 patients.","Levett, Jeremy Y.; Raparelli, Valeria; Mardigyan, Vartan; Eisenberg, Mark J.",CJC Open,148,19

As the COVID-19 pandemic plunged airlines into an unprecedented crisis, its impact on the mental health of flying cabin crews became the focus of a second survey. Methods: Flight attendants were surveyed online with DASS-21 in May 2019 (N = 105; sample 1) and April 2020 (N = 1119; sample 2), complemented with questions about working conditions (in 2019) and existential fears and fear of job loss (in 2020). Results: Sample 1 revealed that symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress highly correlated with the subjective assessment of working conditions, but not with objectifiable parameters. Sample 2 showed significant positive correlations between existential fears and fear of job loss with depression, anxiety and stress. Crew members, grounded in April 2020, showed significantly higher scores in depression and stress, while still flying individuals had more clinically relevant symptoms of anxiety. Mean value comparisons between sample 1 and 2 in DASS-21 revealed a significant increase in symptoms at the time of crisis with effect sizes of d = 0.63 for depression, d = 0.26 for anxiety, and d = 0.52 for stress. The incidence of clinically relevant symptoms among the respondents increased from 8 to 23% (depression), from 6 to 14% (anxiety), and from 8 to 24% (stress). Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic and associated work restrictions coincide with severe impairment of mental health of flying cabin crews, consistent with a mental health protecting function of labor.","Görlich, Yvonne; Stadelmann, Daniel",Front Psychol,148,16

Fortunately, Solar UV-C photons of this wavelength are filtered out by the Ozone layer of the upper Atmosphere, at around 35 km. Softer UV photons from the Sun with wavelengths in the range 290-320 nm (UV-B) and 320-400 nm (UV-A), however, do reach the Earth s surface. The effect of these photons on Single- and Double-Stranded RNA/DNA viruses and the possible role they play on the seasonality of epidemics, are nevertheless little studied and highly debated in alternative or complementarity to other environmental causes. Notably though, the effects of both direct and indirect radiation from the Sun needs to be considered in order to completely explain the effects of UV radiations in life processes (with e.g. the UV virucidal effect enhanced in combination to the concomitant process of water droplets depletion because of Solar heat). Herein we present a number of concurring circumstantial evidence suggesting that the evolution and strength of the recent Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-Cov-2) pandemics, might be have been modulated by the intensity of UV-B and UV-A Solar radiation hitting different regions of Earth during the diffusion of the outbreak between January and July 2020. Out findings, if confirmed by more in depth data analysis and modeling of the epidemics, which includes Solar modulation, could help in designing the social behaviors to be adopted depending on season and environmental conditions.","Nicastro, Fabrizio; Sironi, Giorgia; Antonello, Elio; Bianco, Andrea; Biasin, Mara; Brucato, John R; Ermolli, Ilaria; Pareschi, Giovanni; Salvati, Marta; Tozzi, Paolo; Trabattoni, Daria; Clerici, Mario",,148,5

These advances in telemedicine range from individual to population levels, allowing the exchange of patient information for diagnosis and management of health problems, primary care prevention, and education of physicians via distance learning. OBJECTIVE: This scientometric investigation aims to examine collaborative research networks, dominant research themes and disciplines, and seminal research studies that have contributed most to the field of telemedicine. This information is vital for scientists, institutions, and policy stakeholders to evaluate research areas where more infrastructural or scholarly contributions are required. METHODS: For analyses, we used CiteSpace (version 4.0 R5; Drexel University), which is a Java-based software that allows scientometric analysis, especially visualization of collaborative networks and research themes in a specific field. RESULTS: We found that scholarly activity has experienced a significant increase in the last decade. Most important works were conducted by institutions located in high-income countries. A discipline-specific shift from radiology to telestroke, teledermatology, telepsychiatry, and primary care was observed. The most important innovations that yielded a collaborative influence were reported in the following medical disciplines, in descending order: public environmental and occupational health, psychiatry, pediatrics, health policy and services, nursing, rehabilitation, radiology, pharmacology, surgery, respiratory medicine, neurosciences, obstetrics, and geriatrics. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a continuous rise in scholarly activity in telemedicine, we noticed several gaps in the literature. For instance, all the primary and secondary research central to telemedicine was conducted in the context of high-income countries, including the evidence synthesis approaches that pertained to implementation aspects of telemedicine. Furthermore, the research landscape and implementation of telemedicine infrastructure are expected to see exponential progress during and after the COVID-19 era.","Waqas, Ahmed; Teoh, Soo Huat; Lapão, Luís Velez; Messina, Luiz Ary; Correia, Jorge César",J Med Internet Res,148,33

In the current educational landscape, programs that meet these competencies are offered and attended in an ad hoc manner. During the COVID-19 pandemic and the accompanying switch to virtual learning, our team observed a surge in interest for our weekly nonsequential programs. In this study, we surveyed our learners to better understand motivators for attending these programs during the pandemic and to identify barriers for participating in such events before and during Work-from-Home. Our data indicate that conflict with research responsibilities, time spent to get to the event location, and planning time to attend are all significant barriers to engagement. Notably, feelings of being overwhelmed, which increased slightly during the pandemic, stood out as an identified barrier. Per our results, the virtual format was an attraction. While 58% of respondents would prefer to access professional development programs virtually in the future, almost 42% indicated a preference for in-person events when normalcy resumes, as the physical presence of an instructor and of peers result in a deeper engagement. Our collective analysis here suggests that learners will benefit from a hybrid or combination of synchronous and asynchronous career and professional development programming in the future, even postpandemic, to reduce identified barriers. Alongside hybrid learning engagements, we strongly recommend structured time for learners to enhance their professional competencies, enabled by a commitment from departments and faculty mentors to bring equity in professional skill building and foster a life-long growth mindset.","Gardner, Margery Evans; Bodiya, Elizabeth C.; Subramanian, Shoba",J Microbiol Biol Educ,148,16

The aim of this study was to assess the spread of dental aerosols on patients and dental providers during aerosol-generating dental procedures. METHODS: This pilot study was conducted with one volunteer. A dental unit used at the dental school for general dental care was the site of the experiment. Before the study, three measurement meters (DustTrak 8534, PTrak 8525 and AeroTrak 9306) were used to measure the ambient distribution of particles in the ambient air surrounding the dental chair. The volunteer wore a bouffant, goggles, and shoe covers and was seated in the dental chair in supine position, and covered with a surgical drape. The dentist and dental assistant donned bouffant, goggles, face shields, N95 masks, surgical gowns and shoe covers. The simulation was conducted by using a high-speed handpiece with a diamond bur operating in the oral cavity for 6 min without touching the teeth. A new set of measurement was obtained while using an ultrasonic scaler to clean all teeth of the volunteer. For both aerosol generating procedures, the aerosol particles were measured with the use of saliva ejector (SE) and high-speed suction (HSS) followed a separate set of measurement with the additional use of an extra oral high-volume suction (HVS) unit that was placed close to the mouth to capture the aerosol in addition to SE and HSS. The distribution of the air particles, including the size and concentration of aerosols, was measured around the patient, dentist, dental assistant, 3 feet above the patient, and the floor. RESULTS: Four locations were identified with elevated aerosol levels compared to the baseline, including the chest of the dentist, the chest of patient, the chest of assistant and 3 feet above the patient. The use of additional extra oral high volume suction reduced aerosol to or below the baseline level. CONCLUSIONS: The increase of the level of aerosol with size less than 10 µm was minimal during dental procedures when using SE and HSS. Use of HVS further reduced aerosol levels below the ambient levels.","Yang, Maobin; Chaghtai, Asad; Melendez, Marc; Hasson, Hana; Whitaker, Eugene; Badi, Mustafa; Sperrazza, Leona; Godel, Jeffrey; Yesilsoy, Cemil; Tellez, Marisol; Orrego, Santiago; Montoya, Carolina; Ismail, Amid",BMC Oral Health,148,16

Methods: A mixed methods study of consecutive Victorian suicide cases spanning 1 January 2015 to 31 January 2021. Interrupted time series analysis examined whether suicide frequency changed following the pandemic onset. Thematic analysis was undertaken of police reports in suicides linked with COVID‐19 to try to understand how COVID‐19 acted as a stressor. Results: The frequency of Victorian suicides did not change following the onset of COVID‐19. Sixty COVID‐linked suicides were identified, featuring three recurring themes: COVID‐19 as a disturbance in the self, in relationships with others and institutions. Conclusions: While COVID‐19 has not led to an increase in Victorian suicide frequency to date, it is an important background stressor that can erode one's wellbeing, sense of agency and connectedness to others. Implications for public health: Clinical interventions that serve to reconnect people with a sense of agency and seek to re‐establish contact with significant others are indicated. Clinicians should ensure they are familiar with pathways for their patients to access government social and economic supports.

Tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the interleukin-6 receptor, is being administered off-label to some patients with COVID-19, and although early small studies suggested a benefit, there are no conclusive data proving its usefulness. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 with or without treatment with Tocilizumab. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective study of 1,938 patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to hospitals within the Jefferson Health system in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, between March 25, 2020 and June 17, 2020, of which 307 received Tocilizumab. EXPOSURES: Confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcomes data related to length of stay, admission to intensive care unit (ICU), requirement of mechanical ventilation, and mortality were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: The average age was 65.2, with 47% women; 36.4% were African-American. The average length of stay was 22 days with 26.3% of patients requiring admission to the ICU and 14.9% requiring mechanical ventilation. The overall mortality was 15.3%. Older age, admission to an ICU, and requirement for mechanical ventilation were associated with higher mortality. Treatment with Tocilizumab was also associated with higher mortality, which was mainly observed in subjects not requiring care in an ICU with estimated odds ratio (OR) of 2.9 (p = 0.0004). Tocilizumab treatment was also associated with higher likelihood of admission to an ICU (OR = 4.8, p < 0.0001), progression to requiring mechanical ventilation (OR = 6.6, p < 0.0001), and increased length of stay (OR = 16.2, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Our retrospective analysis revealed an association between Tocilizumab administration and increased mortality, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and length of stay in subjects with COVID-19. Prospective trials are needed to evaluate the true effect of Tocilizumab in this condition.","Li, Michael; Yoo, Erika J.; Baram, Michael; McArthur, Melanie; Skeehan, Connor; Awsare, Bharat; George, Gautam; Summer, Ross; Zurlo, John; Jallo, Jack; Roman, Jesse",Am J Med Sci,148,17

Although recent studies have shown remdesivir and dexamethasone as treatment options, there is an urgent need to find a treatment to inhibit virus replication and to control the progression of the disease. Essential biometal zinc has generated a lot of excitement as one of the promising candidates to reduce the severity of COVID‐19 infection. Several published observations outlined in the review are the reasons why there is a global enthusiasm that zinc therapy could be a possible therapeutic option. However, the biggest challenge in realising the therapeutic value of zinc is lack of optimal treatment modalities such as dose, duration of zinc supplementation and the mode of delivery. In this review, we discuss the regulatory mechanism that hinges upon the bioavailability of zinc. Finally, we propose that intravenous zinc could circumvent the confounding factors affecting the bioavailability of zinc and allow zinc to achieve its therapeutic potential. If successful, due to advantages such as lack of toxicity, low cost and ease of availability, intravenous zinc could be rapidly implemented clinically.","Chinni, Vidyasagar; El‐Khoury, John; Perera, Marlon; Bellomo, Rinaldo; Jones, Daryl; Bolton, Damien; Ischia, Joseph; Patel, Oneel",Br J Clin Pharmacol,148,32

During the early months of the pandemic, when little was known about the virus, the acute hypoxemic respiratory failure it caused did not appear to fit conveniently or consistently into our classification of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This not only re-ignited a half-century's long simmering debate over taxonomy, but also fueled similar debates over how PEEP and lung-protective ventilation should be titrated, as well as the appropriate role of non-invasive ventilation in ARDS. Furthermore, COVID-19 ignited other debates on emerging concepts such as ARDS phenotypes and patient self-inflicted lung injury from vigorous spontaneous breathing. Over a year later these early perplexities have receded into the background without having been reviewed or resolved. With a full year of evidence having been published this narrative review systematically analyzes whether or not COVID-19 associated respiratory failure is essentially ARDS, with perhaps a somewhat different course of presentation. This includes a review of the severity of hypoxemia and derangements in pulmonary mechanics, PEEP requirements, recruitment potential, the ability to achieve lung-protective ventilation goals, duration of mechanical ventilation, associated mortality, and response to non-invasive ventilation. It also reviews the concepts of ARDS phenotypes and patient self-inflicted lung injury as these are crucial to understanding the contentious debate over the nature and management of COVID-19.","Kallet, Richard H",Respiratory care,148,26

Importantly, 15 furloughed HCWs subsequently became COVID-19 positive during their 14-day isolation period, showing the importance of the contact tracing process and the ability to remove workers from the workplace before they become infectious. CONCLUSIONS: A standardised, streamlined contact tracing procedure in healthcare settings ensures any impacts of COVID-19 positive cases are consistently managed.

Many have focused on the militaristic language used to report and explain this illness, a type of language that has permeated discourses of immunology, bacteriology and infection for at least a century. In this article, we examine how language and metaphor were used in the UK media's coverage of another previously unknown and severe infectious disease: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). SARS offers an opportunity to explore the cultural framing of a less extraordinary epidemic disease. It therefore provides an analytical counter-weight to the very extensive body of interpretation that has developed around HIV/AIDS. By analysing the total reporting on SARS of five major national newspapers during the epidemic of spring 2003, we investigate how the reporting of SARS in the UK press was framed, and how this related to media, public and governmental responses to the disease. We found that, surprisingly, militaristic language was largely absent, as was the judgemental discourse of plague. Rather, the main conceptual metaphor used was SARS as a killer. SARS as a killer was a single unified entity, not an army or force. We provide some tentative explanations for this shift in linguistic framing by relating it to local political concerns, media cultures, and spatial factors.","Wallis, Patrick; Nerlich, Brigitte",Soc Sci Med,148,26

The iLMT is a digital version of the standard school learning materials in Serbia, and is characterized by a high degree of interactivity and immediate feedback during the learning process. We conducted an experiment to explore whether iLMT influences student success in solving mathematical tasks that require different types of mathematical reasoning. Based on previous extensive research by Lithner, 4 types of tasks are discussed: high relatedness answer, high relatedness algorithm, local low relatedness, and global low relatedness. The study involved 633 students and 13 teachers of mathematics, equally distributed in control and test groups. The main findings indicate that student success on a knowledge test for high relatedness answer and local low relatedness tasks for the test group was significantly higher than for the control group. On the knowledge retention test, students in the test group outperformed students in the control group at high relatedness algorithm and local low relatedness tasks.

Notre objectif était de décrire la prévalence de l’hyposmie et de l’hypogueusie et de la comparer chez les patients COVID-19 hospitalisés et non hospitalisés pour évaluer l’association de ces symptômes avec la gravité de la maladie. Matériels et méthodes Nous avons réalisé une étude transversale pendant 5jours consécutifs en mars 2020, au sein d’un hôpital centre de référence, du secteur de consultation ambulatoire de ce même hôpital et de deux centres de santé rattachés dans la même ville. Tous les patients testés positifs pour le SARS-CoV-2 hospitalisés pendant la période d’étude et pouvant être interrogés (n =198), les patients vus en consultation externe testés positifs pour le SARS-CoV-2 au cours du mois précédent (n =129), et tous les patients hautement suspects de COVID-19 vus dans les deux centres de santé (n =63) ont été inclus. Résultats Les patients hospitalisés étaient significativement plus souvent de sexe masculin (64 % vs 40 %) et plus âgés (66 vs 43 ans en médiane) et avaient significativement plus de comorbidités que les patients ambulatoires.

Since then, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has been incorporated as part of the standard treatment algorithm in many centers for patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. Since the emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 in early 2020, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has been used effectively as rescue therapy and as a bridge to recovery in some patients with refractory respiratory failure.

University students (n = 924; 575 males; mean age = 25.29 years) completed an online survey during January to February 2021. The proposed expanded PMT model was examined using structural equation modeling (SEM). The results showed that perceived knowledge was significantly associated with coping appraisal (standardized coefficient (β) = 0.820; p < 0.001), and coping appraisal was significantly associated with adaptive response (β = 0.852; p < 0.001), maladaptive response (β = 0.300; p < 0.001) and intention (β = 0.533; p = 0.009). Moreover, maladaptive response (β = −0.173; p = 0.001) but not adaptive response (β = 0.148; p = 0.482) was significantly and negatively associated with intention. The present study’s results demonstrated a positive path between perceived knowledge, coping appraisal, and intention among university students. Therefore, improving knowledge among this population may increase the intention to uptake the vaccine.","Huang, Po-Ching; Hung, Ching-Hsia; Kuo, Yi-Jie; Chen, Yu-Pin; Ahorsu, Daniel Kwasi; Yen, Cheng-Fang; Lin, Chung-Ying; Griffiths, Mark D.; Pakpour, Amir H.",Vaccines (Basel),148,20

However, little is known about what factors influence people’s sharing of verified information about COVID-19. Thus, the purpose of this study was to explore the factors that influence people’s sharing of verified information about COVID-19 on social networking sites. Methods: Based on social exchange theory, we explore the factors that influence sharing of verified information about COVID-19 from two perspectives: benefits and costs. We employed the survey method to validate our hypothesized relationships. By using our developed measurement instruments, we collected 347 valid responses from SNS users and utilized the partial least squares method to analyze the data. Results: Among the benefits of sharing verified information about COVID-19, enjoyment in helping (β = 0.357, p = 0.000), altruism (β = 0.133, p = 0.029) and reputation (β = 0.202, p = 0.000) were significantly associated with verified information sharing about COVID-19. Regarding the costs of sharing verified information about COVID-19, both verification cost (β = −0.078, p = 0.046) and executional cost (β = −0.126, p = 0.011) also significantly affect verified information sharing about COVID-19. All the proposed hypotheses were supported. Conclusions: By exploring factors from both benefits and costs perspectives, we could understand users’ intention to share verified information about COVID-19 comprehensively. This study not only contributes to the literature on information sharing, but also has implications concerning users’ behaviors on SNS.","Xia, Jiabei; Wu, Tailai; Zhou, Liqin",Int J Environ Res Public Health,148,4

Among kidney disease, transplant patients are the most vulnerable group. Information on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in kidney transplant patients is very limited. METHODS: An observational study was conducted on 20 kidney transplant patients who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by polymerase chain reaction from April to June 2020. RESULTS: The majority of cases were males (85%). The median age of the patients was 50 years (interquartile range [IQR] 40.75–60.75). Diabetes and hypertension were present in 55% and 95% of patients, respectively. Coronary artery disease was present in three patients (15%). The median time from transplant to COVID-19 testing was 54 months (IQR 36–105). Chronic allograft nephropathy was found in 35% of patients. The mean baseline creatinine was 1.71 mg/dL. The most common symptom was fever (80%). Acute Kidney Injury was seen in 60% of patients with a mean creatinine of 2.60 mg/dL. Based on severity, 50% of patients had mild disease, 25% moderate disease, and the remaining 25% had severe disease. All 20 patients were on oral steroids, calcineurin inhibitors (18 on tacrolimus and two on cyclosporine), and antimetabolite (19 on mycophenolate mofetil and one on azathioprine). Antimetabolite agents were stopped in all patients and tacrolimus was stopped in severe cases (25%). Hydroxychloroquine was given in 15 patients (75%). Fifteen patients (75%) recovered while five (25%) died. CONCLUSION: Kidney transplant recipients infected with COVID-19 have high mortality.","Bhandari, Gaurav; Tiwari, Vaibhav; Gupta, Anurag; Bhargava, Vinant; Malik, Manish; Gupta, Ashwani; Bhalla, Anil Kumar; Rana, Devinder S.",Indian J Nephrol,148,24

So far, lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) and bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI) levels have not been evaluated as biomarkers for IPA. IL-8, previously introduced as a biomarker for IPA, was also included in this study. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of IPA patients and control patients with non-infectious lung disease was collected according to clinical indications. Measurements in BALF displayed significantly higher levels of LBP (p < 0.0001), BPI (p = 0.0002) and IL-8 (p < 0.0001) in IPA compared to control patients. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed higher AUC for LBP (0.98, 95% CI 0.95–1.00) than BPI (0.84, 95% CI 0.70–0.97; p = 0.0301). Although not significantly different, AUC of IL-8 (0.93, 95% CI 0.85–1.00) also tended to be higher than AUC for BPI (p = 0.0624). When the subgroup of non-hematological patients was analyzed, test performance of LBP (AUC 0.99, 95% CI 0.97–1.00), BPI (AUC 0.97, 95% CI 0.91–1.00) and IL-8 (AUC 0.96, 95% CI: 0.90–1.00) converged. In conclusion, LBP and—to a lesser extend—BPI displayed high AUCs that were comparable to those of IL-8 for diagnosis of IPA in BALF.

They are highly diversified and are the group of mammals with the second largest number of species. Such highly diversified cell types and receptors facilitate them to be potential hosts of a large variety of viruses. Bats are the only group of mammals capable of sustained flight, which enables them to disseminate the viruses they harbor and enhance the chance of interspecies transmission. This article aims at reviewing the various aspects of the global epidemiology of bat coronaviruses (CoVs). Before the SARS epidemic, bats were not known to be hosts for CoVs. In the last 15 years, bats have been found to be hosts of >30 CoVs with complete genomes sequenced, and many more if those without genome sequences are included. Among the four CoV genera, only alphaCoVs and betaCoVs have been found in bats. As a whole, both alphaCoVs and betaCoVs have been detected from bats in Asia, Europe, Africa, North and South America and Australasia; but alphaCoVs seem to be more widespread than betaCoVs, and their detection rate is also higher. For betaCoVs, only those from subgenera Sarbecovirus, Merbecovirus, Nobecovirus and Hibecovirus have been detected in bats. Most notably, horseshoe bats are the reservoir of SARS-CoV, and several betaCoVs from subgenus Merbecovirus are closely related to MERS-CoV. In addition to the interactions among various bat species themselves, bat–animal and bat–human interactions, such as the presence of live bats in wildlife wet markets and restaurants in Southern China, are important for interspecies transmission of CoVs and may lead to devastating global outbreaks.","Wong, Antonio C.

While robust SARS-CoV-2 serological assays were quickly developed, only limited information on applied serological testing is available. We describe the extent and nature of SARS-CoV-2 serological testing used in Europe and assess the links between epidemiology, mitigation strategies applied and seroprevalence. METHODS: An online questionnaire on SARS-CoV-2 serology was sent to the European Society of Clinical Virology and European Non-Polio Enterovirus Network members in September 2020. Data were analysed by comparing mitigation approaches, serological methods and seroprevalance studies performed. RESULTS: About 100 000 laboratory confirmed cases identified between March and June 2020 were reported by 36 participating laboratories from 20 countries. All responders experienced mitigation strategies including lockdowns and other closures. All except one participant had introduced serological testing; most had validated their assays (n = 29), but some had had difficulties in obtaining reference material. Most used commercial assays (n = 35), measuring IgG response against the spike antigen. Serology was used primarily for diagnostic purposes (n = 22) but also for convalescent plasma (n = 13) and research studies (n = 30). Seroprevalence studies targeted mainly health care workers (n = 20; seroprevalance 5% to 22%) and general population (n = 16; seroprevalance 0.88% to 5.6%). Basic demographic and clinical information were collected by most laboratories (n = 28), whereas data on long-term outcomes were rarely collected.

Additionally, it remains unclear whether the D-dimer measurement is useful for VTE risk stratification among COVID-19 patients. This study aimed to offer benchmark data on the incidence of VTE and to examine the difference in D-dimer levels among anticoagulated COVID-19 patients with and without VTE incident. Methods: A comprehensive literature review of PubMed from inception to May 2020 was performed for original studies that reported the frequency of VTE and death among COVID-19 patients who received thromboprophylaxis on hospitalization. The endpoints included VTE (a composite of pulmonary embolism (PE) or deep vein thrombosis (DVT)), PE, DVT, and mortality. Results: A total of 11 cohort studies were included. Among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 23.9% (95% confidence interval (CI), 16.2% to 33.7%; I(2) = 93%) developed VTE despite anticoagulation. PE and DVT were detected in 11.6% (95% CI, 7.5% to 17.5%; I(2) = 92%) and 11.9% (95% CI, 6.3% to 21.3%; I(2) = 93%) of patients, respectively. Patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) had a higher risk for VTE (30.4% )95% CI, 19.6% to 43.9%)) than those in the ward (13.0% (95% CI, 5.9% to 26.3%)). The mortality was estimated at 21.3% (95% CI, 17.0% to 26.4%; I(2) = 53%). COVID-19 patients who developed VTE had higher D-dimer levels than those who did not develop VTE (mean difference, 2.05 µg/mL; 95% CI, 0.30 to 3.80 µg/mL; P = 0.02). Conclusions: The heightened and heterogeneous risk of VTE in COVID-19 despite prophylactic anticoagulation calls into research on the pathogenesis of thromboembolic complications and strategy of thromboprophylaxis and risk stratification. Prominent elevation of D-dimer may be associated with VTE development and can be used to identify high-risk subsets.","Chi, Gerald; Lee, Jane J.; Jamil, Adeel; Gunnam, Vamsikrishna; Najafi, Homa; Memar Montazerin, Sahar; Shojaei, Fahimehalsadat; Marszalek, Jolanta",J Clin Med,148,13

METHODS: Using publicly available data (accessed April 13, 2020), predictors of COVID-19 cases and deaths were compared between disproportionately (>13%) black and all other (<13% black) counties. Rate ratios were calculated and population attributable fractions (PAF) were estimated using COVID-19 cases and deaths via zero-inflated negative binomial regression model. National maps with county-level data and an interactive scatterplot of COVID-19 cases were generated. RESULTS: Nearly ninety-seven percent of disproportionately black counties (656/677) reported a case and 49% (330/677) reported a death versus 81% (1987/2,465) and 28% (684/ 2465), respectively, for all other counties. Counties with higher proportions of black people have higher prevalence of comorbidities and greater air pollution. Counties with higher proportions of black residents had more COVID-19 diagnoses (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.17-1.33) and deaths (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.00-1.40), after adjusting for county-level characteristics such as age, poverty, comorbidities, and epidemic duration. COVID-19 deaths were higher in disproportionally black rural and small metro counties. The PAF of COVID-19 diagnosis due to lack of health insurance was 3.3% for counties with <13% black residents and 4.2% for counties with >13% black residents. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly twenty-two percent of US counties are disproportionately black and they accounted for 52% of COVID-19 diagnoses and 58% of COVID-19 deaths nationally. County-level comparisons can both inform COVID-19 responses and identify epidemic hot spots. Social conditions, structural racism, and other factors elevate risk for COVID-19 diagnoses and deaths in black communities.","Millett, Gregorio A.; Jones, Austin T.; Benkeser, David; Baral, Stefan; Mercer, Laina; Beyrer, Chris; Honermann, Brian; Lankiewicz, Elise; Mena, Leandro; Crowley, Jeffrey S.; Sherwood, Jennifer; Sullivan, Patrick",Ann Epidemiol,148,24

In view of the current COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 is being given special attention, with a thorough examination of all possible transmission pathways linked to the selected waste matrices. Despite the lack of works focused on landfill leachate, a systematic review method, based on cluster analysis, allows to analyze the available papers devoted to sewage sludge and wastewater, allowing to focalize the work on technologies able to detect and treat pathogens. In this work, great attention is also devoted to infectivity and transmission mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, the literature analysis shows that sewage sludge and landfill leachate seem to have a remote chance to act as a virus transmission route (pollution-to-human transmission) due to improper collection and treatment of municipal wastewater and solid waste. However due to the incertitude about virus infectivity, these possibilities cannot be excluded and need further investigation. As a conclusion, this paper shows that additional research is required not only on the coronavirus-specific disinfection, but also the regular surveillance or monitoring of viral loads in sewage sludge, wastewater, and landfill leachate. The disinfection strategies need to be optimized in terms of dosage and potential adverse impacts like antimicrobial resistance, among many other factors. Finally, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogenic microorganisms in sewage sludge, wastewater, and landfill leachate can hamper the possibility to ensure safe water and public health in economically marginalized countries and hinder the realization of the United Nations' sustainable development goals (SDGs).","Anand, Uttpal; Li, Xuan; Sunita, Kumari; Lokhandwala, Snehal; Gautam, Pratibha; Suresh, S.; Sarma, Hemen; Vellingiri, Balachandar; Dey, Abhijit; Bontempi, Elza; Jiang, Guangming",Environ Res,148,10

Using a newly developed data collection tool, inspired by the Experience Sampling Method, a total of 197 episodes were collected about children’s engagement with recorded music. Findings showed that while mothers utilized music to fulfill various emotional needs, they tended to use it to maintain or reinforce their child’s positive mood rather than to improve a negative mood. Also, mothers’ reports suggested various ways that young children engaged with music, being aligned with the multimodal nature of their musical experiences. Lastly, mothers reported that their strategic approaches to use recorded music seemed to help their children feel less distressed and happier, and this, in turn, aided in the reduction of some of the burdens associated with parenting.","Cho, Eun; Ilari, Beatriz Senoi",Front Psychol,148,16

Based on the clinical observation of low prevalence of smoking among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, we examined and identified a “toxin-like” amino acid (aa) sequence in the Receptor Binding Domain of the Spike Glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 (aa 375–390), which is homologous to a sequence of the Neurotoxin homolog NL1, one of the many snake venom toxins that are known to interact with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). We present the 3D structural location of this “toxin-like” sequence on the Spike Glycoprotein and the superposition of the modelled structure of the Neurotoxin homolog NL1 and the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein. We also performed computational molecular modelling and docking experiments using 3D structures of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein and the extracellular domain of the nAChR α9 subunit. We identified a main interaction between the aa 381–386 of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein and the aa 189–192 of the extracellular domain of the nAChR α9 subunit, a region which forms the core of the “toxin-binding site” of the nAChRs. The mode of interaction is very similar to the interaction between the α9 nAChR and α-bungarotoxin. A similar interaction was observed between the pentameric α7 AChR chimera and SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein. The findings raise the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 may interact with nAChRs, supporting the hypothesis of dysregulation of the nicotinic cholinergic system being implicated in the pathophysiology of COVID-19. Nicotine and other nicotinic cholinergic agonists may protect nAChRs and thus have therapeutic value in COVID-19 patients.","Farsalinos, Konstantinos; Eliopoulos, Elias; Leonidas, Demetres D.; Papadopoulos, Georgios E.; Tzartos, Socrates; Poulas, Konstantinos",Int J Mol Sci,148,20

To assess the risk of delayed management of TB, we analyzed the risk factors of prolonged delay in isolation of smear-positive TB patients in pulmonology/infectious diseases and other wards in a tertiary teaching hospital. Methods We enrolled smear-positive TB patients aged > 16 years with delayed respiratory isolation following hospitalization. Medical records were reviewed retrospectively. Time intervals between admission, order of sputum acid-fast staining, initiation of anti-tuberculous treatment and isolation were compared between pulmonology/infectious diseases wards (PIWs) and other wards. Risk factors were analyzed in patients with prolonged isolation delay of > 7 days in individual groups. Results Isolation was delayed in 191 (73.7%) of 259 hospitalized smear-positive TB patients. Median suspicion, treatment and isolation delays were 0, 3 and 4 days in PIWs and 1, 5 and 7 days in other wards. For patients admitted to non-PIWs, atypical chest radiographs, symptoms without dyspnea or not being admitted from the emergency department (ED) were risk factors for prolonged isolation delay exceeding 7 days. The only risk factor for delayed isolation in patients admitted to PIWs was age ≥ 70 years. Conclusion Delays in suspicion, treatment and isolation of TB patients were longer in non-PIWs.

OBJECTIVE: Our objective is to use real-world healthcare data to quantify the impact of demographic, clinical, and social determinants associated with adverse COVID-19 outcomes, to identify high-risk scenarios and dynamics of risk among racial and ethnic groups. DESIGN: A retrospective cohort of COVID-19 patients diagnosed between March 1 and August 20, 2020. Fully adjusted logistical regression models for hospitalization, severe disease and mortality outcomes across 1-the entire cohort and 2- within self-reported race/ethnicity groups. SETTING: Three sites of the NewYork-Presbyterian health care system serving all boroughs of New York City. Data was obtained through automated data abstraction from electronic medical records. PARTICIPANTS: During the study timeframe, 110,498 individuals were tested for SARS-CoV-2 in the NewYork-Presbyterian health care system; 11,930 patients were confirmed for COVID-19 by RT-PCR or covid-19 clinical diagnosis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The predictors of interest were patient race/ethnicity, and covariates included demographics, comorbidities, and census tract neighborhood socio-economic status. The outcomes of interest were COVID-19 hospitalization, severe disease, and death. RESULTS: Of confirmed COVID-19 patients, 4,895 were hospitalized, 1,070 developed severe disease and 1,654 suffered COVID-19 related death. Clinical factors had stronger impacts than social determinants and several showed race-group specificities, which varied among outcomes. The most significant factors in our all-patients models included: age over 80 (OR=5.78, p= 2.29x10(−24)) and hypertension (OR=1.89, p=1.26x10(−10)) having the highest impact on hospitalization, while Type 2 Diabetes was associated with all three outcomes (hospitalization: OR=1.48, p=1.39x10(−04); severe disease: OR=1.46, p=4.47x10(−09); mortality: OR=1.27, p=0.001). In race-specific models, COPD increased risk of hospitalization only in Non-Hispanics (NH)-Whites (OR=2.70, p=0.009). Obesity (BMI 30+) showed race-specific risk with severe disease NH-Whites (OR=1.48, p=0.038) and NH-Blacks (OR=1.77, p=0.025). For mortality, Cancer was the only risk factor in Hispanics (OR=1.97, p=0.043), and heart failure was only a risk in NH-Asians (OR=2.62, p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE.

Here we examine SARS-CoV-2 molecular-based test performance characteristics and summarize case-level data related to COVID-19 diagnosis. From January 11 through April 22, 2020, Public Health Ontario conducted SARS-CoV-2 testing of 86,942 specimens collected from 80,354 individuals, primarily using real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) methods. We analyzed test results across specimen types and for individuals with multiple same-day and multi-day collected specimens. Nasopharyngeal compared to throat swabs had a higher positivity (8.8% vs. 4.8%) and an adjusted estimate 2.9 C(t) lower (SE = 0.5, p<0.001). Same-day specimens showed high concordance (98.8%), and the median C(t) of multi-day specimens increased over time. Symptomatic cases had rRT-PCR results with an adjusted estimate 3.0 C(t) (SE = 0.5, p<0.001) lower than asymptomatic/pre-symptomatic cases. Overall test sensitivity was 84.6%, with a negative predictive value of 95.5%.

However, we have limited understanding of antibody-independent B cell functions, such as cytokine production and antigen presentation, in acute and chronic viral infections and their role in protection and/or immunopathogenesis. Here, we summarize the current literature on these antibody-independent B cell functions and identify remaining knowledge gaps. B cell subsets produce anti- and pro-inflammatory cytokines, which can have both beneficial and detrimental effects during viral clearance. As professional antigen presenting cells, B cells also play an important role in immune regulation/shaping of the developing adaptive immune responses. Since B cells primarily express TLR7 and TLR9, we specifically discuss the role of Toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated B cell responses to viral infections and their role in augmenting adaptive immunity through enhanced cytokine production and antigen presentation. However, viruses have evolved strategies to subvert TLR signaling and additional stimulation via B cell receptor (BCR) may be required to overcome the defective TLR response in B cells. To conclude, antibody-independent B cell functions seem to have an important role in regulating both acute and chronic viral infections and may form the basis for novel therapeutic approaches in treatment of viral infections in the future.","Upasani, Vinit; Rodenhuis-Zybert, Izabela; Cantaert, Tineke",PLoS Pathog,148,16

We have used a bioinformatic approach to aid in designing an epitope peptide-based vaccine against the spike protein of the virus. Five antigenic B cell epitopes with viable antigenicity and a total of 27 discontinuous B cell epitopes were mapped out structurally in the spike protein for antibody recognition. We identified eight CD8+ T cell 9-mers and 12 CD4+ T cell 14-15-mer as promising candidate epitopes putatively restricted by a large number of MHC I and II alleles, respectively. We used this information to construct an in silico chimeric peptide vaccine whose translational rate was highly expressed when cloned in pET28a (+) vector. With our In silico test, the vaccine construct was predicted to elicit high antigenicity and cell-mediated immunity when given as a homologous prime-boost, triggering of toll-like receptor 5 by the adjuvant linker. The vaccine was also characterized by an increase in IgM and IgG and an array of Th1 and Th2 cytokines. Upon in silico challenge with SARS-CoV-2, there was a decrease in antigen levels using our immune simulations. We, therefore, propose that potential vaccine designs consider this approach.","Chukwudozie, Onyeka S.; Gray, Clive M.; Fagbayi, Tawakalt A.; Chukwuanukwu, Rebecca C.; Oyebanji, Victor O.; Bankole, Taiwo T.; Adewole, Richard A.; Daniel, Eze M.",PLoS One,148,1

METHODS: Medline Ovid, CINAHL Plus and ProQuest Health and Medical Collection were searched using both key search terms and medical subject heading terms (MeSH) to identify potentially relevant studies. Eligible studies were those that involved a community-based intervention to reduce unscheduled admissions in adults with diabetes. Papers were initially screened by the primary researcher and then a secondary reviewer. Relevant data were then extracted from papers that met the inclusion criteria. RESULTS: The search produced 2226 results, with 1360 duplicates. Of the remaining 866 papers, 198 were deemed appropriate based on titles, 90 were excluded following abstract review. A total of 108 full papers were screened with 19 full papers included in the review. The sample size of the 19 papers ranged from n = 25 to n = 104,000. The average ages within the studies ranged from 41 to 74 years with females comprising 57% of the participants. The following community-based interventions were identified that explored reducing unscheduled hospital care in people with diabetes; telemedicine, education, integrated care pathways, enhanced primary care and care management teams. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review shows that a range of community-based interventions, requiring different levels of infrastructure, are effective in reducing unscheduled hospital care for hypoglycaemia in people with diabetes. Investment in effective community-based interventions such as integrated care and patient education must be a priority to shift the balance of care from secondary to primary care, thereby reducing hospital admissions.

Understanding the SARS‐CoV‐2 viral clearance profile is crucial to establish a re‐testing plan on discharge and ending isolation of patients. We aimed to evaluate the number of days that a patient needed to achieve undetectable levels of SARS‐CoV‐2 in upper respiratory tract specimens (nasopharyngeal swab and/or an oropharyngeal swab). The clearance and persistence of viral RNA was evaluated in two groups of positive patients: those who achieved two negative RT‐PCR tests and those who kept testing positive. Patients were organized thereafter in two subgroups, mild illness patients discharged home and inpatients who had moderate to severe illness. Results from RT‐PCR tests were then correlated with results from the evaluation of the immune response. The study evidenced that most patients tested positive for more than two weeks and that persistence of viral RNA is not necessarily associated with severe disease but may result from a weaker immune response instead.

Using semi-structured interviews conducted with fifteen midwives working in hospitals or practicing privately, we investigated the impact of the first COVID-19 wave on their work experience, the woman-midwife relationship, and midwife-perceived changes in quality of care. Findings include high levels of stress and insecurity related to the lack of resources and personal protective equipment, feelings of distrust from midwives towards the Belgian State and public health authorities, as well as structural and organizational challenges within maternity wards which negatively affected quality of care. Moreover, based on the midwives' experiences, we demonstrate the need to recognise the views of all stakeholders involved in maternal and newborn care provision, and share five essential lessons learned from this study: 1) it is crucial to acknowledge the central role of midwives for maintaining maternal and newborn care amidst the pandemic and beyond; 2) creating unified national guidelines could support ensuring best practice; 3) efforts must be put in place to diminish the climate of mistrust towards health authorities and to repair the relationship between midwives and decision-makers which was damaged during the pandemic; 4) caring for front-line healthcare workers' mental health is critical, and 5) quality of maternal care can be improved, even in the midst of a pandemic, through team effort and creative solutions tailored to the needs and demands of each setting.","Huysmans, E.; Audet, C.; Delvaux, T.; Galle, A.; Semaan, A.; Asefa, A.; Benova, L.",,148,5

Given the functional account of boredom as a call to action, we hypothesized that this urge to act may drive individuals towards outlets replete with symbolic value (e.g., ideology, identity). In addition, given the politicization of some social distancing rules (e.g., mask wearing), we explored whether those who adhere to strong political ideologies—particularly conservative ideologies—would be more likely to rule-break. Moderation analyses indicated that boredom proneness and social (but not fiscal) conservatism were indeed predictive of rule-breaking. These results highlight the need for both clear messaging emphasizing the strength of communal identity and action (i.e., that “We are all in this together”) and for interventions that emphasize shared collective values in contexts that appeal directly to social conservatives.","Brosowsky, Nicholaus P.; Van Tilburg, Wijnand; Scholer, Abigail A.; Boylan, James; Seli, Paul; Danckert, James",Motiv Emot,148,1

No data are available on the efficacy of caspofungin as PAP in this setting. METHODS: Here, we report our retrospective experience with 103 consecutive patients treated with caspofungin as PAP after Haplo‐SCT. Caspofungin was administered only during the pre‐engraftment phase. RESULTS: Hundred‐day cumulative incidence of proven‐probable IFI (PP‐IFI) was 8.7% and median day of onset was 19 post‐SCT. No patient died of PP‐IFI, and overall survival (OS) and non‐relapse mortality (NRM) hazard ratio (HR) for patients experiencing IFI were 1.02 (P = 0.9) and 0.7 (P = 0.7), respectively. Three‐year overall survival (OS) and 1‐year non‐relapse mortality (NRM) were 55% and 19%, respectively. By univariate analysis, duration of neutropenic phase and partial remission pre‐transplant disease status were associated with increased incidence of IFI, but were not confirmed by multivariate analysis.

Importantly, recent studies highlighted the severity of COVID-19 in MM. To date, however, the mechanism(s) underlying the lack of anti-viral immune response in MM are unclear. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) play a key role in both recognition of viral nucleic acid and initiating anti-viral activity via type 1 interferon (IFN) response signaling. We showed that interactions of dysfunctional pDCs with MM cells, T cells, and NK cells confer immune suppression in the host-MM bone marrow (BM) microenvironment (Chauhan et al, Cancer Cell 2009; 16: p309; Ray et al, Leukemia 2015; 29: p1441). Here, we analyzed the immune-pathway proteins implicated in Covid-19-host interactions [Gordon et al, Nature 2020; 583, p459] to assess whether pDC-MM interactions modulate these pathways to confer immune suppression and susceptibility to COVID-19. We identified the TLR pathway serine/threonine kinase TBK1 (TANK-binding kinase 1), involved in type I IFN induction, as a potential immunotherapeutic target in MM. Moreover, Covid-19 relies on host-Ubiquitin-proteasome-system for propagation, and we found that targeting ubiquitin receptor Rpn13 with a specific inhibitor RA190 restores TBK1 expression in MM. Methods For our studies, we examined SARS-CoV-2-human protein-protein interactions (PPIs) maps (Gordon et al, 2020). pDC-MM co-cultures, and RNAseq using next- generation sequencing (NGS): Purified MM patient pDCs were cocultured with autologous MM cells (1pDC/5MM) for 48h, followed by separation of MM cells from pDCs using FACS. Total RNA from MM cells was subjected to RNAseq analysis using Illumina NGS. Raw sequence data were analyzed to generate differential expression (DEseq2). Linear model (Limma) and its GUI (Glimma) were also used. Statistical significance: log2FC (fold change) values in coculture vs control, with a False Discovery Rate value of <0.05, was considered significant (CI > 95). The heatmap analysis was done using Morpheus software (Broad Institute, MIT). MM patient and pDCs data used for bioinformatics were from the NCBI GEO. Results A total of 41 genes involved in the Covid-19 host-pathogen immune interactions are also differentially expressed in MM after coculture with pDCs. (log2Fold change: ± 3.5-fold; p < 0.00001; pDC-MM vs MM alone). The gene expression widely varies in pDC-MM vs MM [Median (log10): -0.13 to 4.5; adj p < 0.001]. We identified 3 specific innate immunity-linked genes TBK1, IRF3 (Interferon regulatory factor 3), and RAE1 (interferon-inducible mRNA nuclear export factor) which are essential for IFN production in MM. Importantly, pDCs decrease TBK1 (Log2FC: -0.5) and RAE1 (Log2FC: -0.3) as well as induce IRF3 (Log2FC: 1.5) in MM (p < 0.0001). Analysis of publicly available gene profiling datasets on relapsed MM patient showed low levels of TBK1 and RAE1 and higher IRF3 (n = 50) [Log2FC: TBK1: -0.208; RAE1: -0.286; IRF3: 0.273; vs normal; p < 0.05). Of note, low TBK1 expression correlates with poor survival in MM patients (n = 350) and elevated TBK1 correlates with a better prognosis (p = 0.026). Similar analysis showed that most of 41 genes involved in the Covid-19 host-pathogen immune interactions are expressed in pDCs. In unstimulated pDCs, TBK1 expression is significantly lower than IRF3 and RAE1 (2-3-fold, p < 0.05). In functional studies, treatment of pDCs with IFN-α activating CpG-ODN type-A increases both TBK1 (adj P = 0.004) and RAE1 (adj P = 0.043), without significantly altering IRF3 expression. Taken together, we show that TBK1 is downregulated in pDCs, and pDCs-MM interactions further decreases TBK1 in MM, thereby attenuating IFN-mediated anti-viral immune response signaling in MM. Finally, we found that blockade of proteasome-mediated protein degradation via inhibition of Ubiquitin receptor Rpn13 upregulates TBK-1 expression, indicating potential clinical use of targeting Rpn13 in restoring anti-viral immune responses in MM. Conclusion We found that pDC-MM interactions downregulate TBK1, which in turn reduces IFN response signaling essential to generate an effective anti-viral immune response in the MM BM microenvironment. Our findings suggest that: 1) low levels of TBK1 may confer increased susceptibility of MM patients to COVID-19; and 2) targeting TBK1 may restore anti-viral immune response and reduce COVID-19 severity in MM.

Mixed or secondary pneumonia (coinfection) can be seen in viral pneumonia; however, its frequency in COVID-19 has only been investigated in a few studies of short duration, and its significance has not been fully elucidated. We investigated the frequency and significance of co-infection in patients with COVID-19 over a 1-year study period. Methods Coinfection was investigated via multiplex polymerase chain reaction, culture of respiratory samples, rapid diagnostic tests, and paired sera. We used logistic regression analysis to analyze the effect of coinfection on severity at admission and Cox proportional-hazards model analysis to analyze the effect of coinfection on need for high-flow nasal cannula, invasive mandatory ventilation use, and death, respectively. Patients We retrospectively investigated 298 patients who suffered CAP due to SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosed by PCR and were admitted to our institution from February 2020 to January 2021. Results Primary viral pneumonia, and mixed viral and bacterial pneumonia, accounted for 90.3% and 9.7%, respectively, of COVID-19-associated CAP, with viral coinfection found in 30.5% of patients with primary viral pneumonia. Influenza virus was the most common (9.4%). Multivariable analysis showed coinfection not to be an independent factor of severity on admission, need for high-flow nasal cannula or invasive mandatory ventilation, and mortality. Conclusions Viral coinfection was common in COVID-19-associated CAP. Severity on admission, need for high-flow oxygen therapy or invasive mandatory ventilation, and mortality were not affected by coinfection.","Ishiguro, Takashi; Kobayashi, Yasuhito; Shimizu, Yosuke; Uemura, Yukari; Isono, Taisuke; Takano, Kenji; Nishida, Takashi; Kobayashi, Yoichi; Hosoda, Chiaki; Takaku, Yotaro; Shimizu, Yoshihiko; Takayanagi, Noboru",Intern. med.

In the treatment of bone defects, materials based on calcium phosphates (CaPs) are used due to their high resemblance to bone mineral, their non-toxicity, and their affinity to ionic modifications and increasing osteogenic properties. Moreover, CaPs, especially hydroxyapatite (HA), can be successfully used as a vehicle for local drug delivery. Therefore, the aim of this work was to fabricate hydroxyapatite-based composite beads for potential use as local carriers for raloxifene. HA powder, modified with magnesium and silicon ions (Mg,Si-HA) (both of which play beneficial roles in bone formation), was used to prepare composite beads. As an organic matrix, sodium alginate with chondroitin sulphate and/or keratin was applied. Cross-linking of beads containing raloxifene hydrochloride (RAL) was carried out with Mg ions in order to additionally increase the concentration of this element on the material surface. The morphology and porosity of three different types of beads obtained in this work were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and mercury intrusion porosimetry, respectively. The Mg and Si released from the Mg,Si-HA powder and from the beads were measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). In vitro RAL release profiles were investigated for 12 weeks and studied using UV/Vis spectroscopy. The beads were also subjected to in vitro biological tests on osteoblast and osteosarcoma cell lines. All the obtained beads revealed a spherical shape with a rough, porous surface. The beads based on chondroitin sulphate and keratin (CS/KER-RAL) with the lowest porosity resulted in the highest resistance to crushing. Results revealed that these beads possessed the most sustained drug release and no burst release effect. Based on the results, it was possible to select the optimal bead composition, consisting of a mixture of chondroitin sulphate and keratin.","Szurkowska, Katarzyna; Kazimierczak, Paulina; Kolmas, Joanna",Int J Mol Sci,148,1

Survey evidence has documented skepticism in a diverse set of issues including climate change, vaccine hesitancy, and, most recently, COVID-19 risks. Less well understood is whether these beliefs alter high-stakes behavior. Combining GPS data for 2.7 million smartphone users in Florida and Texas with 2016 U.S. presidential election precinct-level results, we examine how conservative-media dismissals of hurricane advisories in 2017 influenced evacuation decisions. Likely Trump-voting Florida residents were 10 to 11 percentage points less likely to evacuate Hurricane Irma than Clinton voters (34% versus 45%), a gap not present in prior hurricanes. Results are robust to fine-grain geographic controls, which compare likely Clinton and Trump voters living within 150 m of each other. The rapid surge in media-led suspicion of hurricane forecasts—and the resulting divide in self-protective measures—illustrates a large behavioral consequence of science denialism.","Long, Elisa F.; Chen, M.

This review analyzes which methods of teledermatology patients prefer by categorizing how recent studies have defined satisfaction, conducted surveys and concluded patients respond to the different modalities of teledermatology. Using PubMed and Cochrane databases, we reviewed studies from April 5th, 2010 to April 5th, 2020 that included the search terms patient satisfaction and teledermatology. All studies that included patient satisfaction as an outcome were included, but studies not published in English were excluded. We examined domains of satisfaction, survey method, study characteristics (including patient population, country, age, study design and evidence score), findings and statistical comparisons. We thoroughly reviewed 23 studies. Definitions of satisfaction varied, but all concluded patients were satisfied with the live-interactive and store-and-forward modalities. The studies reveal that store-and-forward is appropriate for clinicians with established patients who require regular follow-up. Verified areas of care include treatment of chronic conditions, topical skin cancer therapy, wound monitoring, and post-procedural follow-up. Only four studies conducted statistical analyses. One of those studies compared patient preference for each modality of teledermatology with face-to-face dermatology. While this study reported high satisfaction with each mode of teledermatology, patients still preferred face-to-face. Favorable responses to remote diagnostic capabilities suggest that these offerings improve preference for teledermatology. With only one study evaluating preference between each modality and face-to-face dermatology, more studies should address the discrepancy. Surveys that cover all domains of satisfaction may improve assessments and identify where gaps in preference exist.","Hadeler, Edward; Gitlow, Howard; Nouri, Keyvan",Arch Dermatol Res,148,15

The study also addressed such variables as gender, age, length of service, and the reason for employment (voluntary vs. non-voluntary). The research was carried out in Poland in 2020 using the CATI method (a telephone interviewing technique), and it covered a sample of 200 workers (100 self-employed and 100 working under a mandate contract). Most of the respondents declared that their form of employment did not affect their health. However, the statistical analysis showed significant differences in health status between the self-employed and those working on a mandate contract. Self-employed respondents experienced mental health impacts more often, whereas those working under a mandate contract more frequently declared that their physical health was affected. The length of service was only important for mental health, having a negative impact on it. The respondents’ age and gender turned out to be statistically insignificant, which is in contradiction to many previous research findings. The inability to choose one’s form of employment resulted in worse physical health. These findings demonstrate the importance of certain variables that were not prioritized in previous studies and emphasize the need to clearly define what non-standard and precarious forms of employment are, as well as revealing new correlations between the studied categories and providing directions for further research.","Piwowar-Sulej, Katarzyna; Bąk-Grabowska, Dominika",Int J Environ Res Public Health,148,5

Torovirus infections are generally asymptomatic, however, their presence may worsen disease consequences in concurrent infections with other enteric pathogens. METHODS: A total of 872 diarrheic fecal samples from pigs of different ages were collected from 12 districts of Sichuan Province in the southwest of China. RT-PCR was done with PToV S gene specific primers to detect the presence of PToV positive samples. M gene specific primers were used with the PToV positive samples and the genes were sequenced. A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the M gene nucleotide sequences from the 19 selected novel Sichuan strains and 21 PToV and BToV M gene sequences from GenBank. RESULTS: A total of 331 (37.96%, 331/872) samples were found to be positive for PToV and the highest prevalence was observed in piglets aged from 1 to 3 weeks old. Through phylogenetic inference the 40 PToV M gene containing sequences were placed into two genotypes (I & II). The 19 novel Sichuan strains of genotype I showed strong correlations to two Korean gene sequences (GU-07-56-11 and GU-07-56-22). Amino-acid sequence analysis of the 40 PToV M gene strains revealed that the M gene protein was highly conserved. CONCLUSIONS: This study uncovered the presence of PToV in Sichuan Province, and demonstrated the need for continuous surveillance PToV of epidemiology.","Zhou, Lu; Wei, Haoche; Zhou, Yuancheng; Xu, Zhiwen; Zhu, Ling; Horne, Jim",Virol J,148,24

In 2004, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention office in Kenya (CDC Kenya) established the Global Disease Detection Division of which one core component was to support, with other partners, the One Health approach to public health science. After catalytic events such as the global expansion of highly pathogenic H5N1 and the 2006 East African multi-country outbreaks of Rift Valley Fever, CDC Kenya supported key Kenya government institutions including the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, and Fisheries to establish a framework for multi-sectoral collaboration at national and county level and a coordination office referred to as the Zoonotic Disease Unit (ZDU). The ZDU has provided Kenya with an institutional framework to highlight the public health importance of endemic and epidemic zoonoses including RVF, rabies, brucellosis, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus, anthrax and other emerging issues such as anti-microbial resistance through capacity building programs, surveillance, workforce development, research, coordinated investigation and outbreak response. This has led to improved outbreak response, and generated data (including discovery of new pathogens) that has informed disease control programs to reduce burden of and enhance preparedness for endemic and epidemic zoonotic diseases, thereby enhancing global health security. Since 2014, the Global Health Security Agenda implemented through CDC Kenya and other partners in the country has provided additional impetus to maintain this effort and Kenya’s achievement now serves as a model for other countries in the region.

A major concern for patients with penile cancer during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is how the enforced safety measures will affect their disease management. Delays in diagnosis and treatment initiation may have an impact on the extent of the primary lesion as well as the cancer-specific survival because of the development and progression of inguinal lymph node metastases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A review of the COVID-19 literature was conducted in conjunction with analysis of current international guidelines on the management of penile cancer. Results were presented to an international panel of experts on penile cancer and infection control by a virtual accelerated Delphi process using 4 survey rounds. Consensus opinion was defined as an agreement of ≥80%, which was used to reconfigure management pathways for penile cancer. RESULTS: Limited evidence is available for delaying penile cancer management. The consensus rate of agreement was 100% that penile cancer pathways should be reconfigured, and measures should be developed to prevent perioperative nosocomial transmission of COVID-19. The panel also reached a consensus on several statements aimed at reconfiguring the management of penile cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.

A new oropharyngeal/nasal (OP/N) sampling method was investigated using the more readily available throat swab. RESULTS: 35 patients were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 by means of either NP or OP/N sampling. The paired swabs were both positive in 31 patients. The one patient who tested negative on both NP and OP/N swab on admission, was ultimately diagnosed on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. A strong correlation was found between the viral RNA loads of the paired swabs (r = 0.76; P < 0.05).

YxxØ mutation, AP2M1 depletion, or disruption by ACA causes incorrect localization of viral proteins, which is exemplified by the failure of nuclear import of IAV nucleoprotein and diminished endoplasmic reticulum localization of ZIKV-NS3 and enterovirus-A71-2C proteins, thereby suppressing viral replication.

Here, we report the presence of 2A-like sequences in the genomes of a wide range of multicellular organisms and, as in the trypanosome genomes, within non-LTR retrotransposons (non-LTRs)—clustering in the Rex1, Crack, L2, L2A, and CR1 clades, in addition to Ingi. These 2A-like sequences were tested for translational recoding activity, and highly active sequences were found within the Rex1, L2, CR1, and Ingi clades. The presence of 2A-like sequences within non-LTRs may not only represent a method of controlling protein biogenesis but also shows some correlation with such apurinic/apyrimidinic DNA endonuclease-type non-LTRs encoding one, rather than two, open reading frames (ORFs). Interestingly, such non-LTRs cluster with closely related elements lacking 2A-like recoding elements but retaining ORF1.

Among these elements, zinc and vitamins C and D stand out for having immunomodulatory functions and for playing roles in preserving physical tissue barriers.

Thus, the present review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the roles of zinc and vitamins C and D in the immune response to viral infections, focusing on the synergistic action of these nutrients in the maintenance of physical tissue barriers, such as the skin and mucous membranes. The evidence found in the literature shows that deficiency of one or more of these three elements compromises the immune response, making an individual more vulnerable to viral infections and to a worse disease prognosis. Thus, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the adequate intake of zinc and vitamins C and D may represent a promising pharmacological tool due to the high demand for these nutrients in the case of contact with the virus and onset of the inflammatory process.

The multiple pathways of exposure included hand contact via contaminated surfaces and an HCW’s fingers with droplets, droplet spray, and inhalation of inspirable and respirable particles. We assumed a scenario of medium contact time (MCT) and long contact time (LCT) over 1 day of care by an HCW. SARS-CoV-2 in the particles emitted by coughing, breathing, and vocalization (only in the LCT scenario) by the patient were considered. The contribution of the risk of infection of an HCW by SARS-CoV-2 from each pathway to the sum of the risks from all pathways depended on virus concentration in the saliva of the patient. At a virus concentration in the saliva of 101–105 PFU mL−1 concentration in the MCT scenario and 101–104 PFU mL−1 concentration in the LCT scenario, droplet spraying was the major pathway (60%–86%) of infection, followed by hand contact via contaminated surfaces (9%–32%). At a high virus concentration in the saliva (106–108 PFU mL−1 in the MCT scenario and 105–108 PFU mL−1 in the LCT scenario), hand contact via contaminated surfaces was the main contributor (41%–83%) to infection. The contribution of inhalation of inspirable particles was 4%–10% in all assumed cases. The contribution of inhalation of respirable particles increased as the virus concentration in the saliva increased, and reached 5%–27% at the high saliva concentration (107 and 108 PFU mL−1) in the assumed scenarios using higher dose–response function parameter (0.246) and comparable to other pathways, although these were worst and rare cases. Regarding the effectiveness of nonpharmaceutical interventions, the relative risk (RR) of an overall risk for an HCW with an intervention vs. an HCW without intervention was 0.36–0.37, 0.02–0.03, and <4.0 × 10−4 for a face mask, a face shield, and a face mask plus shield, respectively, in the likely median virus concentration in the saliva (102–104 PFU mL−1), suggesting that personal protective equipment decreased the infection risk by 63%–>99.9%. In addition, the RR for a face mask worn by the patient, and a face mask worn by the patient plus increase of air change rate from 2 h−1 to 6 h−1 was <1.0 × 10−4 and <5.0 × 10−5, respectively in the same virus concentration in the saliva. Therefore, by modeling multiple pathways of exposure, the contribution of the infection risk from each pathway and the effectiveness of nonpharmaceutical interventions for COVID-19 were indicated quantitatively, and the importance of the use of a face mask and shield was confirmed.","Mizukoshi, Atsushi; Nakama, Chikako; Okumura, Jiro; Azuma, Kenichi",Environ Int,148,8

Entry processes are commonly analyzed by monitoring internalized virus particles via Western blotting, polymerase chain reaction, and imaging techniques that allow scientist to track the intracellular location of the pathogen. Such studies have provided abundant direct evidence on how viruses interact with receptor molecules on the cell surface, induce cell signaling at the point of initial contact with the cell to facilitate internalization, and exploit existing endocytic mechanisms of the cell for their ultimate infectious agenda. However, there is dearth of knowledge in regards to trafficking of a virus via endosomes. Herein, we describe an optimized laboratory procedure to isolate individual organelles during different stages of endocytosis by performing subcellular fractionation. This methodology is established using Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) infection of human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) cells as a model. With KSHV and other herpesviruses alike, envelope glycoproteins have been widely reported to physically engage target cell surface receptors, such as integrins, in interactions leading to entry and subsequent infection. RESULTS: Subcellular fractionation was used to isolate early and late endosomes (EEs and LEs) by performing a series of centrifugations steps. Specifically, a centrifugation step post-homogenization was utilized to obtain the post-nuclear supernatant containing intact intracellular organelles in suspension. Successive fractionation via sucrose density gradient centrifugation was performed to isolate specific organelles including EEs and LEs. Intracellular KSHV trafficking was directly traced in the isolated endosomal fractions. Additionally, the subcellular fractionation approach demonstrates a key role for integrins in the endosomal trafficking of KSHV. The results obtained from fractionation studies corroborated those obtained by traditional imaging studies. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first of its kind to employ a sucrose flotation gradient assay to map intracellular KSHV trafficking in HFF cells. We are confident that such an approach will serve as a powerful tool to directly study intracellular trafficking of a virus, signaling events occurring on endosomal membranes, and dynamics of molecular events within endosomes that are crucial for uncoating and virus escape into the cytosol.","Walker, Lia R.; Hussein, Hosni A.

The advantage of using cell lines in scientific research is their homogeneity and associated reproducibility in data generated. This chapter introduces the principles behind the setup of a cell culture lab and the guidelines that ensure safety of the lab personnel as well as the cultured cells. It also addresses potential microbiological contaminants and how they can be avoided but also detected early. Since the selection of a particular cell line and specific cell culture conditions depends on the readout of the desired assay, this chapter will present a generalized overview of common mammalian cell culture components and properties that contribute to a suitable cell culture microenvironment. Consequently, this chapter outlines several techniques that are crucial for cell propagation and can be easily adapted to a broad number of cell types and experimental procedures.","Segeritz, Charis-P.; Vallier, Ludovic",Basic Science Methods for Clinical Researchers,148,16

The clinical features and laboratory results of different age groups are different due to the general susceptibility of the disease. The laboratory findings of COVID-19 in pregnant women are also conflicting. Para-clinical investigations including laboratory tests and radiologic findings play an important role in early diagnosis and treatment monitoring of severe acute respiratory syndrome and coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The majority of previous reports on the SARS-CoV-2 laboratory results were based on data from the general population and limited information is available based on age difference and pregnancy status. This review aimed to describe the COVID-19 laboratory findings in neonates, children, adults, elderly and pregnant women altogether for the first time. The most attracting and reliable markers of COVID-19 in patients were: normal C-reactive protein (CRP) and very different and conflicting laboratory results regardless of clinical symptoms in neonates, normal or temporary elevated CRP, conflicting WBC count results and procalcitonin elevation in children, lymphopenia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in adult patients, lymphopenia and elevated CRP and LDH in the elderly people and high CRP, leukocytosis and elevated neutrophil ratio in pregnant women.","Vakili, S.; Savardashtaki, A.; jamalnia, S.; Tabrizi, R.; Nematollahi, M.

Some animal viral infections spread sporadically to human populations, posing a serious health risk. Particularly the emerging viral zoonotic diseases such as the novel, zoonotic coronavirus represent an actual challenge for the scientific and medical community. Besides human health risks, some animal viral infections, although still not zoonotic, represent important economic loses to the livestock industry. Viral infections pose a genuine concern for which there has been an increasing interest for new antiviral molecules. Among these novel compounds, antiviral peptides have been proposed as promising therapeutic options, not only for the growing body of evidence showing hopeful results but also due to the many adverse effects of chemical-based drugs. Here we review the current progress, key targets and considerations for the development of antiviral peptides (AVPs). The review summarizes the state of the art of the AVPs tested in zoonotic (coronaviruses, Rift Valley fever viruses, Eastern Equine Encephalitis Virus, Dengue and Junín virus) and also non-zoonotic farm animal viruses (avian and cattle viruses). Their molecular target, amino acid sequence and mechanism of action are summarized and reviewed. Antiviral peptides are currently on the cutting edge since they have been reported to display anti-coronavirus activity. Particularly, the review will discuss the specific mode of action of AVPs that specifically inhibit the fusion of viral and host-cell membranes for SARS-CoV-2, showing in detail some important features of the fusion inhibiting peptides that target the spike protein of these risky viruses.","Hollmann, Axel; Cardoso, Nancy P.; Espeche, Juan C.; Maffía, Paulo C.",Peptides,148,22

In most of these patients, uncontrolled local and systemic hyperinflammation induces severe and often lethal outcomes. The aging process is characterized by the gradual development of a chronic subclinical systemic inflammation (inflamm-aging) and by acquired immune system impairment (immune senescence). Here, we advance the hypothesis that four well-recognized features of aging contribute to the disproportionate SARS-CoV-2 mortality suffered by elderly men: i. the presence of subclinical systemic inflammation without overt disease, ii. a blunted acquired immune system and type I interferon response due to the chronic inflammation; iii. the downregulation of ACE2 (i.e. the SARS-CoV-2 receptor); and iv. accelerated biological aging. The high mortality rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection suggests that clarification of the mechanisms of inflamm-aging and immune senescence can help combat not only age-related disorders but also SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Bonafè, Massimiliano; Prattichizzo, Francesco; Giuliani, Angelica; Storci, Gianluca; Sabbatinelli, Jacopo; Olivieri, Fabiola",Cytokine Growth Factor Rev,148,24

The first nontravel-related U.S. case was confirmed on February 26 in a California resident who had become ill on February 13 (3). Two days later, on February 28, a second nontravel-related case was confirmed in the state of Washington (4,5). Examination of four lines of evidence provides insight into the timing of introduction and early transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, into the United States before the detection of these two cases. First, syndromic surveillance based on emergency department records from counties affected early by the pandemic did not show an increase in visits for COVID-19-like illness before February 28. Second, retrospective SARS-CoV-2 testing of approximately 11,000 respiratory specimens from several U.S. locations beginning January 1 identified no positive results before February 20. Third, analysis of viral RNA sequences from early cases suggested that a single lineage of virus imported directly or indirectly from China began circulating in the United States between January 18 and February 9, followed by several SARS-CoV-2 importations from Europe. Finally, the occurrence of three cases, one in a California resident who died on February 6, a second in another resident of the same county who died February 17, and a third in an unidentified passenger or crew member aboard a Pacific cruise ship that left San Francisco on February 11, confirms cryptic circulation of the virus by early February. These data indicate that sustained, community transmission had begun before detection of the first two nontravel-related U.S. cases, likely resulting from the importation of a single lineage of virus from China in late January or early February, followed by several importations from Europe. The widespread emergence of COVID-19 throughout the United States after February highlights the importance of robust public health systems to respond rapidly to emerging infectious threats.","Jorden, Michelle A.; Rudman, Sarah L.; Villarino, Elsa; Hoferka, Stacey; Patel, Megan T.; Bemis, Kelley; Simmons, Cristal R.; Jespersen, Megan; Iberg Johnson, Jenna; Mytty, Elizabeth; Arends, Katherine D.; Henderson, Justin J.; Mathes, Robert W.; Weng, Charlene X.; Duchin, Jeffrey; Lenahan, Jennifer; Close, Natasha; Bedford, Trevor; Boeckh, Michael; Chu, Helen Y.; Englund, Janet A.; Famulare, Michael; Nickerson, Deborah A.; Rieder, Mark J.; Shendure, Jay; Starita, Lea M.; Armstrong, Gregory L.; Butler, Jay C.; Coletta, Michael A.; Kite-Powell, Aaron; Bhatnagar, Julu; Reagan-Steiner, Sarah; Tong, Suxiang; Flannery, Brendan; Ferdinands, Jill M.; Chung, Jessie R.",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,148,20

Different analyses propose models to predict the evolution of this epidemic. These analyses propose models for specific geographical areas, specific countries, or create a global model. The models give us the possibility to predict the virus behavior, it could be used to make future response plans. This work presents an analysis of COVID-19 spread that shows a different angle for the whole world, through 6 geographic regions (continents). We propose to create a relationship between the countries, which are in the same geographical area to predict the advance of the virus. The countries in the same geographic region have variables with similar values (quantifiable and non-quantifiable), which affect the spread of the virus. We propose an algorithm to performed and evaluated the ARIMA model for 145 countries, which are distributed into 6 regions. Then, we construct a model for these regions using the ARIMA parameters, the population per 1M people, the number of cases, and polynomial functions. The proposal is able to predict the COVID-19 cases with a RMSE average of 144.81. The main outcome of this paper is showing a relation between COVID-19 behavior and population in a region, these results show us the opportunity to create more models to predict the COVID-19 behavior using variables as humidity, climate, culture, among others.","Hernandez-Matamoros, Andres; Fujita, Hamido; Hayashi, Toshitaka; Perez-Meana, Hector",Appl Soft Comput,148,1
