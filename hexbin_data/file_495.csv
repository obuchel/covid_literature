6046,"Abstracts: 11(th) European Congress of Trauma and Emergency Surgery May 15–18, 2010 Brussels, Belgium",2010,"Monitoring of organ function is one of the core tasks of intensive care medicine. Although various monitoring devices and parameters have already been established for some organs, there are no or only few conditionally useful parameters or scores available for the kidneys, liver, gastrointestinal tract, and blood coagulation. Therefore, specific biomarkers and scores as well as combinations of both are currently investigated for better monitoring of these organs. This article gives a critical overview of currently used as well as investigational biomarkers, tests and scores in general, and shows some examples of the implications for common diseases, clinical situations and constellations in the intensive care unit.","Lehner, G.F.; Pechlaner, C.; Graziadei, I.W.; Joannidis, M.",Med Klin Intensivmed Notfmed,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095894/,495
6494,Invasive Meningococcal Infection: Analysis of 110 cases from a Tertiary Care Centre in North East India,2012-07-22,"The review summarizes data on DNA/RNA aptamers, a novel class of molecular recognition elements. Special attention is paid to the aptamers to proteins involved into pathogenesis of wide spread human diseases. These include aptamers to serine proteases, cytokines, influenza viral proteins, immune deficiency virus protein and nucleic acid binding proteins. High affinity and specific binding of aptamers to particular protein targets make them attractive as direct protein inhibitors. They can inhibit pathogenic proteins and data presented here demonstrate that the idea that nucleic acid aptamers can regulate (inhibit) activity of protein targets has been transformed from the stage of basic developments into the stage of realization of practical tasks.","Spiridonova, V.

We present a case of anti-MDA5 antibody-associated RP-ILD in a patient with arthritis but with no other clinical signs suggestive of DM or CADM successfully treated with a combination of cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine and corticoids. A review of the literature was also done. Despite its rarity, anti-MDA5 antibody-associated ILD should be suspected in cases of RP-ILD even without other signs of DM or CADM as prompt and aggressive treatment could improve prognosis.","González-Moreno, Juan; Raya-Cruz, Manuel; Losada-Lopez, Ines; Cacheda, Ana Paula; Oliver, Cristina; Colom, Bartomeu",Rheumatol Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101732/,495
6775,Unusual and rare manifestations of dengue during a dengue outbreak in a tertiary care hospital in South India,2014-02-09,"Cystinuria is an autosomal recessive disorder of the tubular and intestinal resorption of cystine, ornithine, lysine and arginine leading to nephrolithiasis. Three cystinuria types can be distinguished by the mode of inheritance (true recessive or intermediate) and by the pattern of the intestinal amino acid transport. In the present study phenotypes were assessed by the urinary excretion of amino acids related to creatinine, the percentage tubular amino acid reabsorption and the urinary excretion of polyamines as a possible indicator of the intestinal transport defect. However, our thorough phenotyping did not reveal more than two cystinuria types. Genotypes were examined in linkage analyses and single-strand conformation polymorphism-based mutation identification. The SLC3A1 mutations M467T and T216M were disease causing in our homozygous patients of type I cystinuria. We can show the association of type I cystinuria with SLC3A1 and of non-type I cystinuria with a yet unidentified gene on chromosome 19q13.1. Our phenotype and genotype analyses provide evidence for only two types of cystinuria in the investigated patient cohort.","Langen, H.; von Kietzell, D.; Byrd, D.; Arslan-Kirchner, M.; Vester, U.; Stuhrmann, M.; Dörk, T.; Saar, K.; Reis, A.; Schmidtke, J.; Brodehl, J.",Pediatr Nephrol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102113/,495
7251,Relationship between microbiology of throat swab and clinical course among primary care patients with acute cough: a prospective cohort study,2019-12-17,"The calcium-sensing receptor (CaR) regulates transepithelial calcium transport into milk by mammary epithelial cells. Using a genome-wide screening strategy, we identified the plasma membrane calcium ATPase isoform 2 (PMCA2) as a potential downstream target of the CaR. We show that PMCA2 expression in the mouse mammary gland increases during lactation and that PMCA2 is localized solely to the apical plasma membrane of mammary epithelial cells. In milk from deafwaddler mice, which have mutations in the gene encoding PMCA2, calcium concentrations were reduced, confirming its importance in calcium transport into milk. Furthermore, in cultured primary and EpH4 mouse mammary epithelial cells, CaR stimulation up-regulated calcium-dependent ATPase activity in plasma membrane preparations. By small interfering RNA-mediated gene knockdown of PMCA2, we show that PMCA2 accounts for the preponderance of calcium-ATPase activity. We also show that reduction of CaR expression with small interfering RNA eliminates the ability of extracellular calcium to elicit an increase in calcium-dependent ATPase activity in EpH4 cell membranes. These results demonstrate that activation of the CaR increases PMCA2 activity in mouse mammary epithelial cells, providing a mechanism for the regulation of transepithelial calcium transport by calcium in the lactating mouse mammary gland.","VanHouten, Joshua N.; Neville, Margaret C.; Wysolmerski, John J.",Endocrinology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108505/,495
10034,Scalp Verruca from Barber Clippers: an Epidemiologic Assessment of a Common Fomite,2020-04-18,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the rate of specific pathogens and clinical syndromes associated with acute respiratory tract infections (ARTI) in frail older persons attending daycare. DESIGN: Prospective descriptive study, without intervention. SETTING: Two sites of a senior daycare program providing all‐inclusive care for the older persons in Rochester, New York. PARTICIPANTS: Staff members and participants of the daycare. MEASUREMENTS: Demographic, medical, and physical findings were collected from older subjects at baseline and while ill with respiratory illnesses. Nasopharyngeal specimens for viral and Chlamydia culture and sputum for bacterial culture were obtained from subjects when ill. Acute and convalescent sera were also collected with each illness and examined for viral, chlamydial, and mycoplasma infection. MAIN RESULTS: One hundred sixty‐five illnesses were documented in 165 older daycare participants as well as 113 illnesses among 67 staff members during the 15‐month study. The rate of ARTI in the elderly group was 10.8 per 100 person months. The most common etiologies in both the staff and elderly participants were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Influenza A, and coronavirus. The etiologies of illnesses in the staff compared with those in elderly group were similar except that bacterial infections were significantly more common among the elderly (7% vs. 0, P = 0.05). Multiple pathogens were found to cocirculate within centers, and no clear outbreak of a predominant organism was noted. Cough and nasal congestion characterized most illnesses. The elderly experienced significantly more cough, dyspnea, and sputum production than did the staff. There were 10 hospitalizations related to respiratory infections and four deaths during the acute illness among the elderly group and none in staff. CONCLUSIONS: Acute respiratory infections are a common occurrence in both the staff and participants of a senior daycare center and are the cause of substantial morbidity in frail older persons.","Falsey, Ann R.; McCann, Robert M.; Hall, William J.; Tanner, Martin A.; Criddle, Mary M.; Formica, Maria A.; Irvine, Carrie S.; Kolassa, John E.; Barker, William H.; Treanor, John J.",J Am Geriatr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7166334/,495

11006,Prolonged Outbreak of Candida krusei Candidemia in Paediatric Ward of Tertiary Care Hospital,2020-01-25,"BACKGROUND: The use of appropriate and relevant nurse-sensitive indicators provides an opportunity to demonstrate the unique contributions of nurses to patient outcomes. The aim of this work was to develop relevant metrics to assess the quality of nursing care in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where they are scarce. MAIN BODY: We conducted a scoping review using EMBASE, CINAHL and MEDLINE databases of studies published in English focused on quality nursing care and with identified measurement methods. Indicators identified were reviewed by a diverse panel of nursing stakeholders in Kenya to develop a contextually appropriate set of nurse-sensitive indicators for Kenyan hospitals specific to the five major inpatient disciplines. We extracted data on study characteristics, nursing indicators reported, location and the tools used. A total of 23 articles quantifying the quality of nursing care services met the inclusion criteria. All studies identified were from high-income countries. Pooled together, 159 indicators were reported in the reviewed studies with 25 identified as the most commonly reported. Through the stakeholder consultative process, 52 nurse-sensitive indicators were recommended for Kenyan hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: Although nurse-sensitive indicators are increasingly used in high-income countries to improve quality of care, there is a wide heterogeneity in the way indicators are defined and interpreted. Whilst some indicators were regarded as useful by a Kenyan expert panel, contextual differences prompted them to recommend additional new indicators to improve the evaluations of nursing care provision in Kenyan hospitals and potentially similar LMIC settings. Taken forward through implementation, refinement and adaptation, the proposed indicators could be more standardised and may provide a common base to establish national or regional professional learning networks with the common goal of achieving high-quality care through quality improvement and learning.","Gathara, David; Zosi, Mathias; Serem, George; Nzinga, Jacinta; Murphy, Georgina A.

11113,Parents’ acceptance and regret about end of life care for children who died due to malignancy,2019-05-01,"Worldwide, we observe an increasing focus on fostering well-being in adolescents. This is reflected in growing research in the field of care. However, empirical research is lacking that focuses on the relationship between components of care: receiving care, self-care and extending care. This lack of research is mirrored in the lack of valid measures for assessing care competencies in educational contexts. The present research, therefore, has four goals: 1) to create a valid and reliable scale assessing levels of care competencies based on the multifaceted and multidimensional concept of care; 2) to explore the relationship between socio-demographic characteristics and care competencies in adolescents; 3) to examine the psychological outcomes associated with different levels of care competencies in adolescents; 4) to explore the interaction of the three care dimensions in predicting adolescents’ well-being. Based on data from 742 adolescents, a reliable and valid scale could be developed with six subscales: Receiving care, self-care and extending care, with each of them falling apart in care competencies and care failures. Gender, age and academic achievement were related to care competencies/failures. Findings support the link between adolescents’ well-being and care competencies/failures. These results have implications for promoting adolescents’ well-being through school-based care-cultivation programs.","Tuong, Nguyen Phuoc Cat; Beyers, Wim; Valcke, Martin",Curr Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223108/,495
11154,ECTES Abstracts 2020,2020-05-11,"The antimicrobial functions of neutrophils are facilitated by a defensive armamentarium of proteins stored in granules, and by the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). However, the toxic nature of these structures poses a threat to highly vascularized tissues, such as the lungs. Here, we identified a cell-intrinsic program that modified the neutrophil proteome in the circulation and caused the progressive loss of granule content and reduction of the NET-forming capacity. This program was driven by the receptor CXCR2 and by regulators of circadian cycles. As a consequence, lungs were protected from inflammatory injury at times of day or in mouse mutants in which granule content was low. Changes in the proteome, granule content and NET formation also occurred in human neutrophils, and correlated with the incidence and severity of respiratory distress in pneumonia patients. Our findings unveil a ‘disarming’ strategy of neutrophils that depletes protein stores to reduce the magnitude of inflammation.","Adrover, Jose M.; Aroca-Crevillén, Alejandra; Crainiciuc, Georgiana; Ostos, Fernando; Rojas-Vega, Yeny; Rubio-Ponce, Andrea; Cilloniz, Catia; Bonzón-Kulichenko, Elena; Calvo, Enrique; Rico, Daniel; Moro, María A.; Weber, Christian; Lizasoaín, Ignacio; Torres, Antoni; Ruiz-Cabello, Jesús; Vázquez, Jesús; Hidalgo, Andrés",Nat Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223223/,495

A multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) was performed to identify diagnosis tools for VAP diagnosis. Priority factors were identified after literature review. An international, multidisciplinary expert panel reviewed variables and ranked diagnostic tools. Experts from ten European hospitals participated. Regarding bedside clinical practices, seven required chest X-ray use in all patients, whereas six reported the use of blood cultures and endotracheal aspirate in all patients. Invasive techniques were routinely performed in seven sites. CRP, PCT, and Gram stains were performed in all patients by 5, 2, and 8, respectively. Impact on patient outcomes, safety, and impact on the decision to start antibiotic therapy were ranked as the top three relevant concerns (7.7/10, 7/10, and 6.9/10, respectively). Chest X-ray was ranked as the most important imaging technique to diagnose VAP (score 251.7). Apart from blood cultures, endotracheal aspirate culture was identified as the main collection method for the microbiological testing (scores of 274.8 and 246.8, respectively). Mini-BAL was the preferred invasive technique with a score of 208. Top three biomarkers were CRP (score 184.3), PCT (181.3), and WBC (166.4). Gram stain (192.5) was prioritized among laboratory diagnostic techniques. Using MCDA, it is recommended to perform a combination of diagnostic techniques including images (chest X-ray), culture of clinical specimens (blood cultures and endotracheal aspirate), and biomarkers (CRP or PCT) for VAP diagnosis at the bedside. Gram stain was ranked as the preferred laboratory technique.

Recently isolated Vibrio parahaemolyticus strains have displayed multiple antibiotic resistance. Alternatives to conventional antibiotics are needed, especially for the multiple-antibiotic–resistant V. parahaemolyticus pandemic strain. Methods. A bacteriophage, designated pVp-1, showed effective infectivity for multiple-antibiotic–resistant V. parahaemolyticus and V. vulnificus, including V. parahaemolyticus pandemic strains. The therapeutic potential of the phage was studied in a mouse model of experimental infection using a multiple-antibiotic–resistant V. parahaemolyticus pandemic strain. We monitored the survivability and histopathological changes, quantified the bacterial and phage titers during phage therapy, and observed the immune response induced by phage induction. Results. Phage-treated mice displayed protection from a V. parahaemolyticus infection and survived lethal oral and intraperitoneal bacterial challenges. Conclusions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of phage therapy in a mouse model against a multiple-antibiotic–resistant V. parahaemolyticus pandemic strain infection.","Jun, Jin Woo; Shin, Tae Hoon; Kim, Ji Hyung; Shin, Sang Phil; Han, Jee Eun; Heo, Gang Joon; De Zoysa, Mahanama; Shin, Gee Wook; Chai, Ji Young; Park, Se Chang",J Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7314037/,495

METHODS: The retrospective study included 7 critical COVID-19 patients with acro-ischemia in an intensive care unit (ICU) in Wuhan, from Feb 4 to Feb 15, 2020. The clinical and laboratory data before and during the ICU stay were analyzed. RESULTS: The median age of 7 patients was 59 years and 4 of them were men. Three patients were associated with underlying comorbidities. Fever, cough, dyspnea and diarrhea were common clinical symptoms. All patients had acro-ischemia presentations including finger/toe cyanosis, skin bulla and dry gangrene. D-dimer, fibrinogen and fibrinogen degradation product (FDP) were significantly elevated in most patients. Prothrombin time was prolonged in 4 patients. D-dimer and FDP levels progressively elevated consistent with COVID-2019 exacerbation. Four patients were diagnosed with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) was administrated in 6 patients, which reduced D-dimer and FDP rather than improved clinical symptoms. Five patients died finally and the median time from acro-ischemia to death was 12 days. CONCLUSION: Coagulation parameters should be monitored closely in critical COVID-2019 patients.

Autophagy is tightly controlled at transcriptional and post-translational levels. Nuclear receptors (NRs) are a family of transcriptional factors that regulate the expression of gene sets involved in, for example, metabolic and immune homeostasis. Several NRs show promise as host-directed anti-infectives through the modulation of autophagy activities by their natural ligands or small molecules (agonists/antagonists). Here, we review the roles and mechanisms of NRs (vitamin D receptors, estrogen receptors, estrogen-related receptors, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors) in linking immunity and autophagy during infection. We also discuss the potential of emerging NRs (REV-ERBs, retinoic acid receptors, retinoic acid-related orphan receptors, liver X receptors, farnesoid X receptors, and thyroid hormone receptors) as candidate antimicrobials. The identification of novel roles and mechanisms for NRs will enable the development of autophagy-adjunctive therapeutics for emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases.","Silwal, Prashanta; Paik, Seungwha; Jeon, Sang Min; Jo, Eun-Kyeong",Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7563212/,495
14093,The Flame Retardancy of Polyethylene Composites: From Fundamental Concepts to Nanocomposites,2020-11-05,"Daily PM(2.5) (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 μm) samples were simultaneously collected at two background sites (Wajima Air Monitoring Station (WAMS) and Fukue-Jima Atmosphere and Aerosol Monitoring Station (FAMS)) in Japan in the East Asian winter and summer monsoon periods of 2017 and 2019, to compare the characteristics of air pollutants among different regions and to determine the possible variation during the long-range transport process. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), nitro-PAHs (NPAHs), and water-soluble inorganic ions (WSIIs) were analyzed. Despite the PM(2.5) concentrations at FAMS (8.90–78.5 µg/m(3)) being higher than those at WAMS (2.33–21.2 µg/m(3)) in the winter monsoon period, the average concentrations of ∑PAHs, ∑NPAHs, and ∑WSIIs were similar between the two sites. Diagnostic ratios indicated PAHs mainly originated from traffic emissions and mostly aged, whereas NPAHs were mostly secondarily formed during long-range transport. WSIIs at WAMS were mainly formed via the combustion process and secondary reactions, whereas those at FAMS mainly originated from sea salt and dust. Backward trajectories revealed the air masses could not only come from Asian continental coastal regions but also distant landlocked areas in the winter monsoon period, whereas most came from the ocean in the summer monsoon period. These findings can provide basic data for the establishment of prediction models of transboundary air pollutants in East Asia.","Yang, Lu; Zhang, Lulu; Zhang, Hao; Zhou, Quanyu; Zhang, Xuan; Xing, Wanli; Takami, Akinori; Sato, Kei; Shimizu, Atsushi; Yoshino, Ayako; Kaneyasu, Naoki; Matsuki, Atsushi; Hayakawa, Kazuichi; Toriba, Akira; Tang, Ning",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7664402/,495
14173,Cardio-Renal-Metabolic Care Models: Toward Achieving Effective Interdisciplinary Care,2020-11-12,"INTRODUCTION: Cardiovascular diseases are the world's most common causes of morbidity and mortality in the population, including Central Europe. Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is an effective preventive approach that includes several core components. Physical training is identified as an integral and essential part of CR. Training can positively influence several cardiovascular risk factors in people diagnosed with coronary heart disease and prevent them from clinical events. Our study aims to research the method of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) in a home environment using telerehabilitation. We assume that the HIIT form of telerehabilitation, using a heart rate monitor as a tool for backing up training data, can improve cardiorespiratory fitness and lead to higher peak oxygen uptake than the traditional moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT). METHODS: This study is designed as a monocentral randomized controlled trial at University Hospital Brno in the Czech Republic. After the coronary heart event, the suitable patients will be randomized (1:1 ratio) and separated into 2 groups: the experimental HIIT group and the control MICT group. Both groups undergo a 12-week telerehabilitation with a 1-year follow-up period. Study participants will be telemonitored during physical training in their home environment via a heart rate monitor and a web platform. Once a week, the patients will give their feedback and motivation by a telephone call. The primary outcome observed will be the effect of intervention expressed by changes in cardiorespiratory fitness. Secondary outcomes will be the health-related quality of life, anxiety, training adherence, body composition, safety, and satisfaction. DISCUSSION: The HIIT is widely researched predominantly in a center-based supervised form. Our study differs from others by the use of telemedicine and smart technologies in home-based settings. Previous home-based cardiac telerehabilitation studies have focused primarily on MICT, which has demonstrated feasibility, and results have shown similar improvements as center-based CR. There is a presumption that HIIT may be superior to MICT. However, it can be complicated to self-dose the method in the home environment. Investigators expect that HIIT research will provide insight into the possibilities of telemedicine feasibility, effect, and limitations of coronary heart disease patients’ use at low to moderate cardiovascular risk.","Dosbaba, Filip; Hartman, Martin; Hnatiak, Jakub; Batalik, Ladislav; Ludka, Ondrej",Medicine (Baltimore),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7676562/,495

Here, I review and discuss new work on the molecular picture of protein–lipid interactions that might govern the formation of the substrate–enzyme complex in fluid lipid membranes. Negatively charged PG-type lipids are of particular interest, because they are a major component of bacterial membranes. Atomistic computer simulations indicate POPG and DOPG lipids bridge remote parts of GlpG and might pre-occupy the substrate-docking site. Inhibition of catalytic activity by PG lipids could arise from ligand-like lipid binding at the active site, which could delay or prevent substrate docking. Dynamic protein–lipid H-bond networks, water access to the active site, and fluctuations in the orientation of GlpG suggest that GlpG has lipid-coupled dynamics that could shape the energy landscape of transmembrane substrate docking.

14422,An integrative systematic review of creative arts interventions for older informal caregivers of people with neurological conditions,2020-12-07,"PURPOSE: Age in severely injured patients has been increasing for decades. Older age is associated with increasing mortality. However, morbidity and mortality could possibly be reduced when accurate and aggressive treatment is provided. This study investigated age-related morbidity and mortality in polytrauma including age-related decisions in initial injury management and withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy (WLST). METHODS: A 6.5-year prospective cohort study included consecutive severely injured trauma patients admitted to a Level-1 Trauma Center ICU. Demographics, data on physiology, resuscitation, MODS/ARDS, and infectious complications were prospectively collected. Patients were divided into age subgroups (< 25, 25–49, 50–69, and ≥ 70 years) to make clinically relevant comparisons. RESULTS: 391 patients (70% males) were included with median ISS of 29 (22–36), 95% sustained blunt injuries. There was no difference in injury severity, resuscitation, urgent surgeries, nor in ventilator days, ICU-LOS, and H-LOS between age groups. Adjusted odds of MODS, ARDS and infectious complications were similar between age groups. 47% of patients ≥ 70 years died, compared to 10–16% in other age groups (P < 0.001). WLST increased with older age, contributing to more than half of deaths ≥ 70 years. TBI was the most common cause of death and decision for treatment withdrawal in all age groups. CONCLUSIONS: Patients ≥ 70 years had higher mortality risk even though injury severity and complication rates were similar to other age groups. WLST increased with age with the vast majority due to brain injury. More than half of patients ≥ 70 years survived suggesting geriatric polytrauma patients should not be excluded from aggressive injury treatment based on age alone.

14701,Effects of physical activity on the progression of diabetic nephropathy: a meta-analysis,2021-01-05,"BACKGROUND: The gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) is an important part of the immune system and compromised in HIV treatment-naïve as well as in HIV-seropositive patients on antiretroviral treatment (ART) due to HIV-induced changes. The influence of the impaired GALT on the postoperative complication rate after surgery for penetrating abdominal trauma has not been investigated and the hypothesis that the HIV-induced changes of the GALT contribute to septic complications postoperatively was tested. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This prospective study included patients who required a small bowel resection due to abdominal gunshot wounds. A bowel specimen was obtained in the index operation, and the T-lymphocytic quantity in the specimen was analyzed via immunohistochemistry to scrutinize whether these lymphocyte numbers had an impact on the postoperative outcome. Septic and postoperative complications were documented during the in-hospital course and the first month after discharge. RESULTS: In total, 62 patients were included in the study of which 38 patients were HIV-seronegative and 24 were HIV-seropositive. HIV-seropositive patients had a significantly lower quantity of CD4 + T cells in the GALT compared to the HIV-seronegative patients (p = 0.0001), which was also associated with a significantly higher rate of septic complications in the postoperative course. In the HIV-seropositive group, no significant differences were detected for T-lymphocytic quantity in the GALT between the HIV-treatment naïve and antiretroviral treatment groups. CONCLUSION: The compromised GALT in HIV-seropositive patients may predispose these patients to postoperative septic complications. Antiretroviral therapy does not result in an adequate immune reconstitution in this tissue.","Mauser, Martin; Kruger, Deirdré; Pather, Sugeshnee; Plani, Frank",World J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7802609/,495

This has resulted in a significant public health burden over the years, evident through increasing rates of hospitalization and AF-related clinical encounters. The resultant gap in health care outcomes is largely twinned with suboptimal rates of anticoagulation prescription and adherence, deficits in symptom identification and management, and insufficient comorbid cardiovascular risk factor investigation and modification. In view of these shortfalls in care, the establishment of integrated chronic care models serves as a road map to best clinical practice. The expansion of integrated chronic care programs, which include multidisciplinary team care, nurse-led AF clinics, and use of telemedicine, are expected to improve AF-related outcomes in the coming years.

In medical specialist departments, the use of telemonitoring increased from 11.2% (18/161) in 2014 to 19.6% (36/184) in 2019 (χ(2)(4)=12.3; P=.02). In 2019, telemonitoring was used by 5.8% (28/485) of people with chronic disease. This was 18.2% (41/225) in GP organizations and 40.4% (44/109), 38.0% (78/205), and 8.9% (29/325) in the organizations of nurses working in primary, secondary, and elderly care, respectively. Up to 10% of the targeted patient group such as diabetics were regarded by health care professionals as suitable for using telemonitoring. The main benefits mentioned by the patients were “comfort” (421/1043, 40.4%) and “living at home for longer/more comfortably” (334/1047, 31.9%). Health care professionals added “improvement of self-management” (63/176, 35.8% to 57/71, 80.3%), “better understanding of the patient’s condition” (47/176, 26.7% to 42/71, 59.2%), “reduction of workload” (53/134, 39.6% of nurses in elderly care), “better tailoring of care plan to the patient’s situation” (95/225, 42.2% of GPs), and “saves time for patients/caregivers” (61/176, 34.7% of medical specialists). Disadvantages mentioned by professionals were that “it takes time to monitor data” (13/130, 10% to 108/225, 48.0%), “it takes time to follow up alerts” (15/130, 11.5% to 117/225, 52.0%), and “it is difficult to estimate which patients can work with telemonitoring” (22/113, 19.5% to 94/225, 41.8%). CONCLUSIONS: The uptake of telemonitoring in Dutch chronic care remained stable during 2014-2019 but increased among medical specialists. According to both patients and professionals, telemonitoring improves the quality of life and quality of care. Skills for suitably including eligible patients and for allocating the tasks of data monitoring and follow-up care within the team would help to further increase the use of telemonitoring.","Huygens, Martine W J; Voogdt-Pruis, Helene R; Wouters, Myrah; Meurs, Maaike M; van Lettow, Britt; Kleijweg, Conchita; Friele, Roland D",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8129877/,495
18312,The effect of postoperative complications on health-related quality of life and survival 12 years after coronary artery bypass grafting – a prospective cohort study,2021-06-14,"Elemental composition of Gossypium hirsutum L. (cotton), Oryza sativa L. (Asian rice), Phaseolus vulgaris L. (common bean), Saccharum spp. L. (sugarcane), and Zea mays L. (corn) was used to calculate their empirical formulas (unit carbon formulas) and growth stoichiometry. The empirical formulas were used to find standard enthalpy of formation, standard molar entropy, standard Gibbs energy of formation, and standard molar heat capacity. A comparison was made between thermodynamic properties of live matter of the analyzed plants and other unicellular and multicellular organisms. Moreover, the growth process was analyzed through standard enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs energy of biosynthesis. The average standard Gibbs energy of biosynthesis was found to be +463.0 kJ/C-mol. Thus, photosynthesis provides energy and carbon for plant growth. The average intercepted photosynthetic energy was found to be 15.5 MJ/C-mol for the analyzed plants. However, due to inefficiency, a great fraction of the intercepted photosynthetic energy cannot be used by plants. The average usable photosynthetic energy was found to be –2.3 MJ/C-mol. The average thermodynamic driving force for growth is –1.9 MJ/C-mol. Driving forces of growth of C3 and C4 plants were compared. It was found that C4 plants have a greater driving force of growth than C3 plants, which reflects the greater efficiency of C4 photosynthesis. The relationship between the driving force and growth rates was analyzed by determining phenomenological L coefficients. The determined phenomenological coefficients span two orders of magnitude, depending on plant species and environmental conditions. The L coefficient of P. vulgaris was found to be lower than that of other plants, due to additional energy requirements of nitrogen fixation.","Popovic, Marko; Minceva, Mirjana",Front Plant Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8202407/,495
18780,Cohort profile: follow-up of a Berlin Aging Study II (BASE-II) subsample as part of the GendAge study,2021-06-23,"Nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-containing family protein 3 (NLRP3) regulated the maturation of inflammation-related cytokines by forming NLRP3 inflammasome, which plays pivotal roles in sepsis pathogenesis. In this study, we evaluated the genetic association of NLRP3 polymorphisms with sepsis (640 patients and 769 controls) and characterized the impact of NLRP3 polymorphisms on NLRP3 expression and inflammatory responses. No significant differences were observed in genotype/allelic frequencies of NLRP3 29940G>C between sepsis cases and controls. The G allele was significantly overrepresented in patients with septic shock than those in sepsis subgroup, and the GC/GG genetypes were related to the 28-day mortality of sepsis. Lipopolysaccharide challenge to peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed a significant suppression of NLRP3 mRNA expression and release of IL-1β and TNF-α in CC compared with the GC/GG genotype category. Functional experiments with luciferase reporter vectors containing the NLRP3 3′-UTR with the 29940 G-to-C variation in HUVECs and THP-1 cells showed a potential suppressive effect of miR-146a on NLRP3 transcription in the presence of the C allele. Taken together, these results demonstrated that the 29940 G-to-C mutation within the NLRP3 3′-UTR was a gain-of-function alteration that caused the suppression of NLRP3 expression and downstream inflammatory cytokine production via binding with miR-146a, which ultimately protected patients against susceptibility to sepsis progression and poor clinical outcome.","Lu, Furong; Chen, Hongpeng; Hong, Yuan; Lin, Yao; Liu, Lizhen; Wei, Ning; Wu, Qinyan; Liao, Shuanglin; Yang, Shuai; He, Junbing; Shao, Yiming",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8233413/,495
19208,The role of inflammation and metabolic risk factors in the pathogenesis of calcific aortic valve stenosis,2020-09-25,"Pandemics have been recognized as a serious global threat to humanity. To effectively prevent the spread and outbreak of the epidemic disease, theoretical models intended to depict the disease dynamics have served as the main tools to understand its underlying mechanisms and thus interrupt its transmission. Two commonly-used models are mean-field compartmental models and agent-based models (ABM). The former ones are analytically tractable for describing the dynamics of subpopulations by cannot explicitly consider the details of individual movements. The latter one is mainly used to the spread of epidemics at a microscopic level but have limited simulation scale for the randomness of the results. To overcome current limitations, a hierarchical hybrid modeling and simulation method, combining mean-field compartmental model and ABM, is proposed in this paper. Based on this method, we build a hybrid model, which takes both individual heterogeneity and the dynamics of sub-populations into account. The proposed model also investigates the impact of combined interventions (i. e. vaccination and pre-deployment training) for healthcare workers (HCWs) on the spread of disease. Taking the case of 2014-2015 Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in Sierra Leone as an example, we examine its spreading mechanism and evaluate the effect of prevention by our parameterized and validated hybrid model. According to our simulation results, an optimal combination of pre-job training and vaccination deployment strategy has been identified. To conclude, our hybrid model helps informing the synergistic disease control strategies and the corresponding hierarchical hybrid modeling and simulation method can further be used to understand the individual dynamics during epidemic spreading in large scale population and help inform disease control strategies for different infectious disease.","Chen, Peiyu; Fan, Wenhui; Guo, Xudong",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8259970/,495
19588,Examining the barriers of influenza vaccine hesitancy in persons with dementia: a literature review,2021-07-28,"BACKGROUND: Standardised checklists of items to be addressed in clinical study protocols and publications are promoting transparency in research. However, particular specifications for exceptional cases, such as children with minor parents are missing. This study aimed to examine the level of transparency regarding recruitment and informed consent approaches in publications of clinical trials recruiting children with minor parents in sub-Saharan Africa. We thereby focused particularly on the transparency about consenting persons (i.e. proxy decision-makers) and assessed the need to expand reporting guidelines for such exceptional cases. METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of clinical trial publications previously identified through a systematic review. Multiple scientific databases were searched up to March 2019. Clinical trial publications addressing consent and potentially recruiting children with minor parents in sub-Saharan Africa were included. 44 of the in total 4382 screened articles met our inclusion criteria. A descriptive analysis was performed. RESULTS: None of the included articles provided full evidence on whether any recruited children had minor parents and how consent was obtained for them. Four proxy decision-maker types were identified (parents; parents or guardians; guardians; or caregivers), with further descriptions provided rarely and mostly in referenced clinical trial registrations or protocols. Also, terminology describing proxy decision-makers was often used inconsistently. CONCLUSIONS: Reporting the minimum maternal age alongside maternal data provided in baseline demographics can increase transparency on the recruitment of children with minor mothers. The CONSORT checklist should require clinical trial publications to state or reference exceptional informed consent procedures applied for special population groups. A standardized definition of proxy decision-maker types in international clinical trial guidelines would facilitate correct and transparent informed consent for children and children with minor parents.

20008,The impact of Israel’s Front-of-Package labeling reform on consumers' behavior and intentions to change dietary habits,2021-08-11,"BACKGROUND: The HIV pandemic continues to cause a high burden of morbidity and mortality due to delayed diagnosis. Histoplasmosis is prevalent in Latin America and Colombia, is difficult to diagnose and has a high mortality. Here we determined the clinical characteristics and risk factors of histoplasmosis in people living with HIV (PLWH) in Pereira, Colombia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective cross-sectional study (2014–2019) involving two tertiary medical centers in Pereira, Colombia. People hospitalized with HIV were included. Histoplasma antigen detection was performed in urine samples. Probable histoplasmosis was defined according to European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group/National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Mycoses Study Group criteria. RESULTS: 172 HIV-infected patients were analyzed. Histoplasmosis was confirmed in 29% (n = 50/172) of patients. The logistic regression analysis showed that the risk factors for histoplasmosis were pancytopenia (OR 4.1, 95% CI 1.6–10.3, P = 0.002), < 50 CD4 + cells/μL (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.3–7.3, P = 0.006) and Aspartate transaminase (AST) levels > 46 IU/L (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.3–8, P = 0.010). CONCLUSIONS: Histoplasmosis is highly prevalent in hospitalized patients with HIV in Pereira, Colombia. The clinical findings are nonspecific, but there are some clinical abnormalities that can lead to suspicion of the disease, early diagnosis and prompt treatment. Urine antigen detection is useful for diagnosis, but is not widely available. An algorithmic approach is proposed for low-resource clinical settings.","Hoyos Pulgarin, Julián Andrés; Alzate Piedrahita, John Alexander; Moreno Gómez, German Alberto; Sierra Palacio, Juan Felipe; Ordoñez, Karen Melissa; Arias Ramos, Deving",AIDS Res Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8358261/,495
20048,Aetiology and severity of childhood pneumonia in primary care in Malawi: a cohort study,2021-07-29,"BACKGROUND: The decision to admit or refer a patient presenting with an obstetric emergency is extremely crucial. In rural India, such decisions are usually made by young physicians who are less experienced and often miss relevant data points required for appropriate decision making. In our setting, before the quality improvement (QI) initiative, this information was recorded on loose blank sheets (first information sheets (FIS)) where an initial clinical history, physical examination and investigations were recorded. The mean FIS completeness, at baseline, was 73.95% (1–5 January 2020) with none of the FIS being fully complete. Our objective was to increase the FIS completeness to >90% and to increase the number of FIS that were fully complete over a 9-month period. METHODS: With the help of a prioritisation matrix, the QI team decided to tackle the problem of incomplete FIS. The team then used fishbone analysis and identified that the main causes of incomplete FIS were that the interns did not know what to document and would often forget some data points. Change ideas to improve FIS completeness were implemented using Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles, and ultimately, a checklist (referred to as antenatal care (ANC) checklist) was implemented. The study was divided into six phases, and after every phase, a few FIS were conveniently sampled for completeness. RESULTS: FIS completeness improved to 86.34% (p<0.001) in the post implementation phase (1 Feb to 31 August 2020), and in this phase, 69.72% of the FIS were documented using the ANC checklist. The data points that saw the maximum improvement were relating to the physical examination. CONCLUSION: The use of ANC checklist increased FIS completeness. Interns with no prior clinical and QI experience can effectively lead and participate in QI initiatives. The ANC checklist is a scalable concept across similar healthcare settings in rural India.","Puntambekar, Varad; Sharma, Aparna K; Yadav, Kapil; Kumar, Rakesh",BMJ Open Qual,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8336185/,495

27301,Coping with pain: The impact of SARS visitation restrictions on patients' perception of nursing support,2004-04-08,"OBJECTIVES: Transmissible Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) strains have been described in CF and may be associated with a poorer prognosis. The “Prairie Epidemic Strain” (PES) has been recently identified in up to 30% of patients at prairie-based CF centres, however, its clinical impact remains to be determined. METHODS: A cohort study of adults with cystic fibrosis from 1981–2014 was conducted and all PA isolates from clinical visits were prospectively collected. PA strain typing at clinic enrolment, and most recent was conducted by PFGE. Patients were divided into one of four cohorts: no PA, transient PA, unique chronic PA, and chronic PES. Random effects and proportional Cox hazard models were conducted for outcome of death, transplantation and FEV1% decline. RESULTS: 204 patients (54% male) with CF were analysed: 38 no PA, 20 transient PA, 103 unique PA, 43 PES. Baseline FEV1% was lowest in the chronic PES group (p = 0.002). Overall rate of FEV1% decline was –1.19%/year (95% CI: –1.41 to –0.97, p<0.001); the chronic PES group had the greatest rate of decline at –1.24%/year (p<0.001). There were a total of 42 deaths and 37 transplants through 1862 and 2050 follow-up years, respectively. The age-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for death was not different for the PA groups compared to the no PA group. Relative to the no PA group, risk of transplant was increased in those with chronic PES (HR 9.13, CI 1.29–69, p = 0.032) compared to the no PA group. CONCLUSION: Chronic PES infection is significantly associated with a greater rate of FEV1% decline and risk of lung transplantation but not with increased risk of death compared to no PA infection.","Somayaji, R.; Lam, J.; Surette, M.; Waddell, B.; Purighalla, S.; Sibley, C.; Rabin, H.R.; Parkins, M.D.",J Cyst Fibros,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7129143/,495
27320,TOC,2004-04-02,"Annual influenza epidemics continue to cause worldwide morbidity, mortality and societal disruption, especially among the aged residents of residential care homes for the elderly (RCHEs). Vaccination remains the most effective measure to prevent influenza and its associated complications. The seasonal influenza vaccine uptake rates among RCHE staff were much lower than that among residents. In order to increase uptake of influenza vaccination among RCHE staff in Hong Kong, this study developed and evaluated amultimodal vaccine promotion program (VPP) based on identified factors affecting vaccination acceptance or refusal within the Hong Kong Chinese context. Vaccine acceptance was found to be significantly associated with belief in vaccine efficacy, duration of service, staff group and providing direct care to residents. The focus group study revealed that RCHE staff's belief in the efficacy and safety of the vaccine played a major role in vaccine acceptance. VPP effectiveness was evaluated with a cluster randomised controlled trial among RCHEs with staff vaccination rates below 50%. Compared with 2008/09, the 2009/10 mean staff vaccination rates increased significantly in both the intervention (39.4% to 59.6% (P < 0.001)) and control groups (36.3% to 47.6% (P = 0.008)). RCHE staff in the intervention group had a higher vaccination rate than in the control group (59.6% versus 47.6%, P = 0.072). This program reinforces the importance of a comprehensive and culturally sensitive approach to promote influenza vaccination for RCHE staff.","Chen, H.; Ng, Sammy; King, Mark E.; Fong, Carol; Ng, W.P.; Szeto, K.H.; Ho, Sara; Leung, Jane; Lam, C.K.; Chan, Shelley; Chan, W.M.; Wong, T.Y.",Healthc Infect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7129256/,495

The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of using meditative virtual reality to improve the hospital experience of ICU patients. DESIGN: Final report of prospective observational trial. SETTING: Surgical and trauma ICUs of the University of Florida Health, an academic hospital. PATIENTS: Fifty-nine nonintubated adult ICU patients without delirium at recruitment. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were exposed to sessions of commercially available meditative virtual reality applications focused on calmness and relaxation, performed once daily for up to 7 days. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Outcome measures included pain level, pain medication administration, anxiety, depression, sleep quality, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, delirium status, and patient ratings of the virtual reality system. Comparisons were made using paired t tests and mixed models. The virtual reality meditative intervention improved patients’ ICU experience with reduced levels of anxiety and depression; however, there was no evidence that virtual reality had significant effects on physiologic measures, pain, or sleep. CONCLUSIONS: The use of meditative virtual reality technology in the ICU was easily implemented and well-received by patients.","Ong, Triton L.; Ruppert, Matthew M.; Akbar, Maisha; Rashidi, Parisa; Ozrazgat-Baslanti, Tezcan; Bihorac, Azra; Suvajdzic, Marko",Crit Care Explor,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7314318/,495

38277,Implementing Telemedicine in Primary Care: Learning Lessons From Electronic Health Records,2020-08-27,"In this paper we employ SMT solvers to soundly synthesise Lyapunov functions that assert the stability of a given dynamical model. The search for a Lyapunov function is framed as the satisfiability of a second-order logical formula, asking whether there exists a function satisfying a desired specification (stability) for all possible initial conditions of the model. We synthesise Lyapunov functions for linear, non-linear (polynomial), and for parametric models. For non-linear models, the algorithm also determines a region of validity for the Lyapunov function. We exploit an inductive framework to synthesise Lyapunov functions, starting from parametric templates. The inductive framework comprises two elements: a learner proposes a Lyapunov function, and a verifier checks its validity - its lack is expressed via a counterexample (a point over the state space), for further use by the learner. Whilst the verifier uses the SMT solver Z3, thus ensuring the overall soundness of the procedure, we examine two alternatives for the learner: a numerical approach based on the optimisation tool Gurobi, and a sound approach based again on Z3. The overall technique is evaluated over a broad set of benchmarks, which shows that this methodology not only scales to 10-dimensional models within reasonable computational time, but also offers a novel soundness proof for the generated Lyapunov functions and their domains of validity.","Ahmed, Daniele; Peruffo, Andrea; Abate, Alessandro",Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7439753/,495

We aim to describe the past contributions, current efforts, and future directions of the TSRA within a conceptual framework of the TSRA mission. METHODS: Primary review of educational resources was performed to report goals and content of past contributions. TSRA Executive Committee input was utilized to describe current resources and activities, as well as the future goals of the TSRA. Podcast analytics were performed to report national and global usage. RESULTS: Since 2011, the TSRA has published 3 review textbooks, 5 reference guides, 3 test preparation textbooks, 1 supplementary publication, and 1 multiple choice question bank and mobile application, all written and developed by cardiothoracic surgery trainees. In total 108 podcasts have been recorded by mentored trainees, with over 175,000 unique listens. Most recently, the TSRA has begun facilitating trainee submissions to Young Surgeon’s Notes, fostered a trainee mentorship program, developed the monthly TSRA Newsletter, and established a wide-reaching presence on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to help disseminate educational resources and opportunities for trainees. CONCLUSIONS: The TSRA continues to be the leading cardiothoracic surgery resident organization in North America, providing educational resources and networking opportunities for all trainees. Future directions include development of an integrated disease-based resource and continued collaboration within and beyond our specialty to enhance the educational opportunities and career development of cardiothoracic trainees.","Brescia, Alexander A.; Lou, Xiaoying; Louis, Clauden; Blitzer, David; Coyan, Garrett N.; Han, Jason J.; Watson, Justin J.; Mehaffey, J.

METHODS: 3011 hospitalized elderly patients were enrolled from 13 national teaching hospitals between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2014 initiated by the CAP-China network. Risk factors for CF were screened by multivariable logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The incidence of CF in elderly CAP patients was 13.1%. CF patients were older, longer hospital stays and higher treatment costs than clinical success (CS) patients. The CF patients were more prone to present hyperglycemia, hyponatremia, hypoproteinemia, pleural effusion, respiratory failure and cardiovascular events. Inappropriate initial antimicrobial regimens in CF group were significantly higher than CS group. Undertreatment, CURB-65, PH < 7.3, PaO(2)/FiO(2) < 200 mmHg, sodium < 130 mmol/L, healthcare-associated pneumonia, white blood cells > 10,000/mm(3), pleural effusion and congestive heart failure were independent risk factors for CF in multivariable logistic regression analysis. Male and bronchiectasis were protective factors. CONCLUSIONS: Discordant therapy was a cause of CF.

During infection, influenza virus interacts extensively with the cellular PTMs system to aid in its successful infection and dissemination. The complex interplay between viruses and the PTMs system induces global changes in PTMs of the host proteome as well as modifications of specific host or viral proteins. The most common PTMs include phosphorylation, ubiquitination, SUMOylation, acetylation, methylation, NEDDylation, and glycosylation. Many PTMs directly support influenza virus infection, whereas others contribute to modulating antiviral responses. In this review, we describe current knowledge regarding the role of PTMs in different stages of the influenza virus replication cycle. We also discuss the concerted role of PTMs in antagonizing host antiviral responses, with an emphasis on their impact on viral pathogenicity and host range.","Hu, Jiao; Zhang, Lei; Liu, Xiufan",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7498822/,495

42821,An alternative application of tissue paper,2020-12-05,"BACKGROUND: Human Sapoviruses (SaVs) has been reported as one of the causative agents of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) worldwide. An outbreak of SaVs affected 482 primary school students during spring activities from February 24 to March 11, 2019 in Shenzhen City, China. Our study was aimed at determining the epidemiology of the outbreak, investigating its origins, and making a clear identification of the SaVs genetic diversity. METHODS: Epidemiological investigation was conducted for this AGE outbreak. Stool samples were collected for laboratory tests of causative agents. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and conventional RT-PCR were used for detecting and genotyping of SaVs. The nearly complete genome of GII.8 SaV strains were amplified and sequenced by using several primer sets designed in this study. Phylogenetic analysis was performed to characterize the genome of GII.8 SaV strains. RESULTS: The single factor analysis showed that the students who were less than 1.5 m away from the vomitus in classroom or playgroundwere susceptible (P < 0.05). Seven of 11 fecal samples from patients were positive for GII.8 SaV genotype. In this study, we obtained the genome sequence of a SaV GII.8 strain Hu/SaV/2019008Shenzhen/2019 /CHN (SZ08) and comprehensively analyzed the genetic diversity. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the GII.8 strain SZ08 formed an independent branch and became a novel variant of GII.8 genotype. Strain SZ08 harbored 11 specific amino acid variations compared with cluster A-D in full-length VP1. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified SaVs as the causative agents for the AGE outbreak. Strain Hu SZ08 was clustered as independent branch and there was no recombination occurred in this strain SZ08. Further, it might become the predominant strain in diarrhea cases in the near future. Constant surveillance is required to monitor the emerging variants which will improve our knowledge of the evolution of SaVs among humans.","Yan, Yuxiao; Li, Yuan; Shi, Wen; Kong, Xiangyu; Li, Huiying; Zhang, Qing; Pang, Lili; Jiang, Li; Liu, Junying; Jin, Miao; Li, Yuning; Duan, Zhaojun",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7706173/,495

Consequently, these reductions in dementia services and resources have added to existing challenges and (in)equities for this stigmatized population. The objectives of this study were to identify how community-based resources and services for people with dementia and their caregivers are impacted by public health emergency measures enacted during COVID-19 and other infectious pandemics and secondly, use an intersectional health equity perspective to explore how supports for people and families living with dementia are affected by social determinants of health. A scoping review using JBI methodology was conducted. Academic databases searched included Embase, Medline, CINAHL and PAIS. Grey literature was searched using the CADTH tool. English articles published after 2000 in high-income countries were included. Data was extracted by two reviewers using an adaptation of the Health Equity Impact Assessment tool to explore factors related to health equity. Findings included articles discussing the COVID-19 pandemic (N=15). Most alterations to dementia services included switching to telehealth platforms with some advantages/disadvantages of this method discussed. Limited information on how different populations experienced service changes was identified and more research is needed to address issues of (in)equities for people living with dementia and their caregivers during public health emergencies.

The histology and immunohistochemical profile of the two tumors were typical of prostate and lung cancers. The presence of the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion was demonstrated by next-generation sequencing on both malignancies, leading to the assumption that the lung nodule was a metastasis from the prostate cancer. The patient failed to respond to antiandrogen therapy, while chemotherapy for lung cancer led to a significant objective response.

Therefore, there is an increasing need to understand the disease mechanisms, identify drug targets and inflammatory processes associated with a SARS-CoV-2 infection. To address this need, we created a targeted mass spectrometry based multiplexed panel of 96 immune response associated proteins. We applied the multiplex assay to a cohort of serum samples from asymptomatic and moderately affected patients. All patients had tested positive for a SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR and were determined to be subsequently positive for antibodies. Even 40-60 days post-viral infection, we observed a significant remaining inflammatory response in all patients. Proteins that were still affected were associated with the anti-inflammatory response and mitochondrial stress. This indicates that biochemical and inflammatory pathways within the body can remain perturbed long after SARS-CoV-2 infections have subsided even in asymptomatic and moderately affected patients.","Doykov, Ivan; Hällqvist, Jenny; Gilmour, Kimberly C.; Grandjean, Louis; Mills, Kevin; Heywood, Wendy E.",F1000Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7745182/,495

To eliminate this procedure and to use the gram-positive nature of B. subtilis, YuaB, which is one of the major B. subtilis biofilm components and locates in the cell wall, based cell surface display system, is developed. P43 promoter driven overexpression of YuaB-His(6) tag does not hamper bacterial cell growth and promoted biofilm formation of recombinant strain. Flow cytometry of recombinant strain and its protoplast using FITC-Anti His(6) antibody, verified that YuaB locate in plasma membrane and protrude to the outside of cell wall, which means YuaB can be used as very efficient anchoring motif.

The density of each cell is optimized by changing the strut diameter and fillet-joint radius according to loading conditions. The equivalent material properties of MLS, such as elastic modulus and shear modulus, are calculated based on a computational homogenization method. Finite element analyses of the full-shape and homogenized lattice model under external compressive load are conducted to evaluate the equivalent material properties. We also designed an optimized three-point bending structure using the proposed method. Based on the results of the topology optimization, three types of lattices with different relative densities are designed in a local zone considering local deformation modes. The result of this work shows that multi-lattice bending structure has about 86.9 % higher strength than that of a uniform BCC lattice structure with the same weight.","Jeong, Ho Seung; Lyu, Sung-Ki; Park, Sang Hu",J Mech Sci Technol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7989720/,495

55179,Diabetes Update 2021: Pathophysiologie und Prävention des Typ‑2-Diabetes,2021-06-29,"BACKGROUND: During the COVID‐19 pandemic, in‐person cadaveric dissection to teach anatomy was often omitted. While knowledge‐based assessment can be evaluated via remote exams, soft skills (e.g., reflections on the topic of death) can often be overlooked. This study aims to quantitatively investigate how different anatomy course formats play a role in initiating students’ reflections on life's passing, during the COVID‐19 pandemic. METHOD: In the fall semester of 2020, 216 medical, dental, premedical undergraduate, and health sciences students from 14 international universities discussed (in small groups) differences in their anatomy courses as part of an online exchange program. Formats of anatomy education delivery in the 14 universities ranged from dissection, hybrid dissection‐prosection, and prosection only, to no laboratory exposure during the pandemic. Students’ responses to the question, “Did/does your Anatomy course initiate your thinking on life's passing?” were collected utilizing a multiple‐choice question and a short essay. Statistical analysis was performed using Chi‐square analysis. RESULTS: 105 students dissected (group 1), 21 had a hybrid dissection‐prosection class (group 2), and 79 had no dissection (group 3). 11 students did not have an anatomy course. Within the 3 groups, 149 students had exposure to human anatomical specimens and 52 students did not. A majority of students in groups 1 and 2 reported that the anatomy course helped them to initiate reflections on the topic of death, compared to those in group 3 (75% and 71% respectively, versus 36%, p<0.05). The majority of students who had exposure to human anatomical specimens thought that the course did initiate thoughts about life's passing, compared to students who did not have this exposure (p<0.05). Students who did not dissect during the time of the pandemic felt that talking with their peers who did dissect during this period (i.e., at schools that did offer dissection) resulted in initiating thoughts about the topic of death. DISCUSSION: Anatomy dissection courses and exposure to human anatomical specimens help initiate reflection on the topic of life's passing. During the COVID‐19 pandemic interactions between students who do not dissect and their peers who do dissect help initiate thoughts about the topic of death in the non‐dissecting students, as reflected by their essays. Without exposure to human bodies there is less chance that students will think about this subject. CONCLUSION: Anatomy dissection courses are important for the initiation of students’ feelings about the topic of death. During the COVID‐19 pandemic, dissecting students can help non‐dissecting students with initiating reflections about life's passing by discussing this subject with each other.","Wu, Anette; Utomo, Rachel; Gill Sagoo, Mandeep; Wingate, Richard; Brassett, Cecilia; Chien, Chung‐Liang; Traxler, Hannes; Waschke, Jens; Vielmuth, Franziska; Sakurai, Takeshi; Zeroual, Mina; Olsen, Jorgen; El Batti, Salma; Viranta‐Kovanen, Suvi; Yamada, Yukari; McWatt, Sean; Kitahara, Shuji; Keay, Kevin; Kellett, Anne; Skonieczny, Michael; Mao, Yinghui; Lang, Ariella; Kunzel, Carol; Bernd, Paulette; Kielstein, Heike; Noel, Geoffroy",FASEB J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239500/,495

Near-infrared spectroscopy has been described as a non-invasive, continuous method to monitor cerebral oxygen saturation. However, its impact on neurobehavioral outcome comparing different anesthesia regimens has been poorly described. METHODS In this prospective, assessor-blinded study, 90 patients undergoing shoulder surgery in beach chair position following general (G-group, n=45) or regional anesthesia (R-group; n=45) were enrolled to assess the prevalence of cerebral desaturation events comparing anesthesia regimens and their impact on neurobehavioral and neurological outcome. Anesthesiologists were blinded to regional cerebral oxygen saturation values. Baseline data assessed the day before surgery included neurological and neurobehavioral tests, which were repeated the day after surgery. The baseline data for regional cerebral oxygen saturation/bispectral index and invasive blood pressure both at heart and auditory meatus levels were taken prior to anesthesia, 5 min after induction of anesthesia, 5 min after beach chair positioning, after skin incision and thereafter all 20 min until discharge. RESULTS Patients in the R-group showed significantly less cerebral desaturation events (p<0.001), drops in regional cerebral oxygen saturation values (p<0.001), significantly better neurobehavioral test results the day after surgery (p<0.001) and showed a greater hemodynamic stability in the beach chair position compared to patients in the G-group. CONCLUSIONS The incidence of regional cerebral oxygen desaturations seems to influence the neurobehavioral outcome. Regional anesthesia offers more stable cardiovascular conditions for shoulder surgery in beach chair position influencing neurobehavioral test results at 24h.","Aguirre, J; Borgeat, A; Trachsel, T; Cobo Del Prado, I; De Andrés, J; Bühler, P",Revista espanola de anestesiologia y reanimacion,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.redar.2013.08.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24119783/,495

METHODS Retrospective study of a cohort of patients with influenza-like symptoms from 2016 to 2018 who participated in a clinical trial in thirteen urban primary centres in Catalonia. Different epidemiological data were collected. Patients rated the different symptoms and signs on a Likert scale (absent, little problem, moderate problem and severe problem) and self-reported the measure of health status with the EuroQol visual analogue scale. A nasopharyngeal swab was taken for microbiological isolation of influenza and other microorganisms. RESULTS A total of 427 patients were included. Microbiologically confirmed influenza was found in 240 patients (56.2%). The percentage of patients with moderate-to-severe cough, muscle aches, tiredness and dizziness was greater among patients with microbiologically confirmed influenza. The self-reported health status was significantly lower among patients with true flu infection (mean of 36.3 ± 18.2 vs 41.7 ± 17.8 in patients without influenza; p<0.001).

Method In an analytical cross-sectional design, the total number of cases of COVID-19 in Mexico from February 29 to July 24, 2020 was studied, and compared with sentinel cases calculated from the Rt. A descriptive and comparative analysis of prevalence, cumulative incidence and case fatality was performed to summarize the epidemiological data for Mexico and in relation to information for Italy, Spain, and the United States of North America. Results In Mexico, until July 24, 2020, there are a total of 390,516 cases of COVID-19 and 43,680 deaths from this disease; with the use of Rt to calculate the correction of cases and unidentified deaths, the figure increases to 3,780,195 cases (p = 0.0002) and 211,469 deaths (p = 0.001). This suggests underreporting in the identification of cases and deaths and is associated with one of the highest case fatality rates in the world for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusions In Mexico, the sentinel model presents a significant loss of unquantified information.

65063,[Between intensive care and palliative care at the time of CoViD-19.],2020-04-01,"OBJECTIVE This study aimed to describe parents' perceptions of the factors that facilitate or are barriers to their involvement in children's type 1 diabetes (T1D) management among African American and Latino parents. METHODS African American and Latino parents (N = 28) of 5- to 9-year-old children with T1D completed audio-recorded, semi-structured interviews that were transcribed and analyzed using thematic analysis. Themes were identified that aligned with the theoretically-derived Capability-Opportunity-Motivation-Behavior (COM-B) framework. RESULTS Parents described Capability-based facilitators of parent involvement, including positive stress management, religious/spiritual coping, organizational/planning skills, and diabetes knowledge. Capability-based barriers included child and parent distress. Interpersonal relationships, degree of flexibility in work environments, and access to diabetes technologies were both Opportunity-based facilitators and barriers; and Opportunity-based barriers consisted of food insecurity/low financial resources. Parents' desire for their child to have a ""normal"" life was described as both a Motivation-based facilitator and barrier. CONCLUSIONS African American and Latino families described helpful and unhelpful factors that spanned all aspects of the COM-B model. Reinforcing or targeting families' unique psychological, interpersonal, and environmental strengths and challenges in multilevel interventions has potential to maximize parental involvement in children's diabetes management.","Butler, Ashley M; Hilliard, Marisa E; Titus, Courtney; Rodriguez, Evadne; Al-Gadi, Iman; Cole-Lewis, Yasmin; Thompson, Deborah",Journal of pediatric psychology,https://doi.org/10.1093/jpepsy/jsz103; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31995219/,495

A nested mixed-methods approach was used to examine aged care leaders' opinions about the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of aged care residents and staff. METHODS A total of 288 senior staff of Australian residential aged care facilities (care managers, clinical care coordinators, and lifestyle team leaders; mean age = 52.7 years, SD = 10.3) completed an online survey between 10th September and 31st October 2020. RESULTS On average, nearly half of their residents experienced loneliness (41%) and a third experienced anxiety in response to COVID-19 (33%). The most frequently noted contributors to poor mental health among residents were restrictions to recreational outings and watching news coverage relating to COVID-19. Participants emphasized the need for increased access to counseling services and improved mental health training amongst staff. Residential care staff were similarly impacted by the pandemic. More than a third of staff were reported as anxious (36%) and 20% depressed, in response to COVID-19. Staff were worried about introducing COVID-19 into their facility and were impacted by news coverage of COVID-19. Staff would feel supported by financial assistance and by increased staff-resident ratios. CONCLUSIONS Senior staff perceive that the mental health of Australian aged care residents and staff was negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The most noted contributors were identified, as was the mental health support for aged care communities. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS This study provides government and policymakers with clear intervention targets for supporting the sector. Clinicians can support residential aged care communities by providing on-site or telehealth counseling, and upskill and train residential aged care staff on how to respond to the emotional needs of residents in response to COVID-19.","Brydon, Aida; Bhar, Sunil; Doyle, Colleen; Batchelor, Frances; Lovelock, Harry; Almond, Helen; Mitchell, Leander; Nedeljkovic, Maja; Savvas, Steven; Wuthrich, Viviana",Clinical gerontologist,https://doi.org/10.1080/07317115.2021.1985671; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34634217/,495

New OM episodes are usually coincident with a viral upper respiratory tract infection (vURTI), but there are conflicting data regarding the association between specific viruses and OM. DESIGN Longitudinal (October-March), prospective follow-up of children for coldlike illness (CLI) by diary, middle ear status by pneumatic otoscopy, and vURTI by PCR. SETTING Academic medical centers. PARTICIPANTS A total of 102 families with at least 2 children aged between 1 and 5 years (213 children; mean [SD] age, 3.7 [1.5] years; 110 male; and 176 white) were recruited from the local communities at 2 study sites by advertisement. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES New OM and CLI episodes and nasopharyngeal virus detections. RESULTS A total of 176 children (81%) had isolated PCR detection of at least 1 virus. The OM coincidence rates were 62 of 144 (44%) for rhinovirus, 15 of 27 (56%) for respiratory syncytial virus, 8 of 11 (73%) and 1 of 5 (20%) for influenza A and B, respectively, 6 of 12 (50%) for adenovirus, 7 of 18 (39%) for coronavirus, and 4 of 11 (36%) for parainfluenza virus detections (P = .37). For rhinovirus, new OM occurred in 50% of children with and 32% without a concurrent CLI (P = .15), and OM risk was predicted by OM and breastfeeding histories and by daily environment outside the home. CONCLUSIONS New OM was associated with nasopharyngeal detection of all assayed viruses irrespective of the presence or absence of a concurrent CLI. Differences among viruses were noted, but statistical significance was not achieved, possibly because of the low power associated with the small number of nonrhinovirus detections.","Alper, Cuneyt M; Winther, Birgit; Mandel, Ellen M; Hendley, J Owen; Doyle, William J",Archives of otolaryngology--head & neck surgery,https://doi.org/10.1001/archotol.135.1.17; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19153302/,495

AIMS To assess length of treatment persistence of first anti-TNF therapy and influencing factors used in the standard care of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases. METHODS Single-centre, retrospective study from a register including patients who received anti-TNF therapy in the last 20 years at the study centre. Kaplan-Meier analysis with log-rank test was used to describe treatment persistence. With multivariable Cox regression analysis, risk factors for treatment failure were investigated. RESULTS Five hundred thirty-eight patients (CD, Crohn's disease: 367, UC, ulcerative colitis: 147, inflammatory bowel disease unclassified: 24) with a median follow-up of 8.1 years were included. Median (95% confidence interval) treatment persistence in the total cohort was 2.3 years (28 [22, 38] months), and nearly half of patients withdrew from treatment within 2 years. Male patients were treated longer than females (male: 37 [25, 48] months, female: 23 [14, 33] months, P = 0.002). Treatment persistence was longer in CD compared to UC (CD: 39 [30, 50] months, UC: 13 [9, 19] months, P < 0.001), and patients with CD remained longer on adalimumab than on infliximab treatment (adalimumab: 67 [55, 95] months, infliximab: 19 [14, 31] months, P < 0.001). Treatment failure (52%) and side effects (25%) were the most common reasons for withdrawal from therapy; 14% withdrew due to remission. Female sex was identified as independent predictor for treatment failure in UC (hazard ratio [CI]: 1.73 [1.02-2.92], P = 0.04). CONCLUSION Long-term treatment persistence of first anti-TNF therapy was limited in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases, primarily due to treatment failure and side effects.","Blesl, Andreas; Binder, Lukas; Högenauer, Christoph; Wenzl, Heimo; Borenich, Andrea; Pregartner, Gudrun; Berghold, Andrea; Mestel, Sigrid; Kump, Patrizia; Baumann-Durchschein, Franziska; Petritsch, Wolfgang",Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1111/apt.16478; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34151449/,495

METHOD All patients treated between 2004 and 2011 were identified. Relevant patient characteristics were gathered. A questionnaire concerning disease-related symptoms as well as the Cleveland Clinic Incontinence Score (CCIS) and Cleveland Clinic Constipation Score (CCCS) was sent to all patients. RESULTS A total of 245 patients underwent operation. Twelve patients (5%) died during follow-up and were excluded. The remaining patients (224 women, nine men) were sent a questionnaire. Indications for LVR were external RP (n = 36), internal RP or symptomatic rectocele (n = 157) or a combination of symptomatic rectocele and enterocele (n = 40). Mean age and follow-up were 62 years (range 22-89) and 30 months (range 5-83), respectively. Response rate was 64% (150 patients). The complication rate was 4.6% (11 complications). A significant reduction in symptoms of constipation or obstructed defaecation syndrome was reported (53% of patients before vs 19% after surgery, P < 0.001). Mean CCCS during follow-up was 8.1 points (range 0-23, SD ± 4.3). Incontinence was reported in 138 (59%) of the patients before surgery and in 32 (14%) of the patients after surgery, indicating a significant reduction (P < 0.001). Mean CCIS was 6.7 (range 0-19, SD ± 5.2) after surgery. CONCLUSION A significant reduction of incontinence and constipation or obstructed defaecation syndrome after LVR was observed in this large retrospective study. LVR therefore appears a suitable treatment for RP and rectocele with and without associated enterocele.","Formijne Jonkers, H A; Poierrié, N; Draaisma, W A; Broeders, I A M J; Consten, E C J",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,https://doi.org/10.1111/codi.12113; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23406289/,495

The crystal structure is monoclinic, but its lattice is metrically strongly pseudo-orthorhombic and underpins a strongly pseudo-hexagonal sublattice. Several possible twin laws are compatible with these metric specializations, among which the one found experimentally corresponds to a trichromatic point group. Twinning is by reticular pseudo-merohedry with twin index 2 and zero obliquity but a non-zero twin misfit. The twin lattice coincides with the pseudo-hexagonal sublattice of the individual domain, which justifies the adoption of the unconventional setting B21 of the space group.","Nespolo, Massimo; Smaha, Rebecca W; Parkin, Sean","Acta crystallographica Section B, Structural science, crystal engineering and materials",https://doi.org/10.1107/s2052520620008021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32831282/,495

MATERIALS AND METHODS The role of the fixation of the mesh is especially important in regard to the endoscopic technique. The fixation of mesh through penetrating techniques using staples, clips, or screws is associated with a significantly increased risk of developing a chronic post-herniotomy inguinal pain syndrome (CPIP). In order to answer the question ""fixation or no fixation of the mesh,"" the use of self-adhesive mesh is an optimal compromise. CONCLUSION With the authors own operative technique consisting also of a standard pre- and post-operative management, the self-adhesive mesh was proven to be extremely reliable. As no specific materials to fix the mesh were needed, the method was fast, simple, and economical. We could also reduce the incidences of chronic inguinal pain in our patient population by using the self-adhesive mesh, without the risk of an increased recurrence rate in the observation period.","Klobusicky, Pavol; Feyerherd, Peter",Frontiers in surgery,https://doi.org/10.3389/fsurg.2015.00028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26161386/,495

Whole mixtures collected from locations upgradient and downgradient of multiple fuel release sites were tested using (1) in vitro screening assays for human genotoxicity (the gamma-h2ax assay) and estrogenic effects (estrogen receptor transcriptional activation assay) and (2) chronic aquatic toxicity tests in 3 species (Ceriodaphnia dubia, Raphidocelis subcapitata, and Pimephales promelas). In vitro screening assay results demonstrated that the mixtures did not cause genotoxic or estrogenic effects. No OCOC-related aquatic toxicity was observed and, when aquatic toxicity did occur, upgradient samples typically had the same response as samples downgradient of the release, indicating that background water quality was impacting the results. This information provides additional support for previous work that focused on the individual compounds and, taken together, indicates that OCOCs from petroleum degradation at fuel release sites are unlikely to cause toxicity to human or freshwater receptors at the concentrations present.

72568,Staying Apart During a Pandemic.,2020-06-29,"PURPOSE Preoperative progressive pneumoperitoneum (PPP) has not been reported in the management of parastomal hernias; therefore, the present study evaluated its effectiveness in the surgical management of large parastomal hernias. PATIENTS AND METHODS This prospective, observational study included 23 consecutive patients with large parastomal hernias who underwent PPP between January 2016 and September 2018. The volume of parastomal hernia (VPH), volume of the abdominal cavity (VAC), and the VPH/VAC ratio were measured before and after PPP using abdominal computed tomography scan data. All the hernias were repaired by a laparoscopic or laparoscopic-open-laparoscopic approach using the intraperitoneal Sugarbaker technique. RESULTS Before and after PPP, the mean VPH was 1442 and 1581 mL (P<0.01), and the mean VAC was 5667 and 9194 mL (P<0.01). The VAC increased by 3527 mL (P<0.01) and was greater than the mean VPH before PPP. The VPH/VAC ratio after PPP was reduced at an average of 8.1% (P<0.01). Fascial closure was achieved in all patients, with no clinical evidence of elevated intra-abdominal pressures. The mean follow-up was 24 months (13 to 40 mo), and, to date, no hernia recurrences have been reported in these patients. CONCLUSIONS PPP is a feasible and useful tool in the surgical management of large parastomal hernias. It passively expands the abdominal volumes, thereby resulting in respiratory adaptation to elevated intra-abdominal pressures.","Tang, Fuxin; Ma, Ning; Li, Ying-Ru; Gan, Wen-Chang; Zong, Zhen; Zhou, Tai-Cheng; Chen, Shuang","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",https://doi.org/10.1097/sle.0000000000000759; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31985570/,495

There is substantial debate on which anastomotic technique is the best for patients undergoing Ivor Lewis esophagectomy. Our standardized technique is a circular stapled anastomosis with either a 25 or 28 mm anvil. The aim of this study was to retrospectively analyze whether the stapler diameter had an impact on postoperative anastomotic leak rates during a 4-year time frame from 2016 to 2020. A total of 632 patients (open, hybrid, and totally minimally invasive esophagectomy) met the inclusion criteria. A total of 214 patients underwent an anastomosis with a 25 mm stapler vs. 418 patients with a 28 mm stapler. Anastomotic leak rates were 15.4% vs. 10.8%, respectively (p = 0.0925). Stapler size should be chosen according to the individual anatomical situation of the patient.

We explored the patients treated by thrombectomy to investigate the association between a favorable clinical outcome of EVMT in intracranial internal carotid artery occlusion (iICAO) and a set of predictors. METHODS A total of 38 iICAO patients treated by EVMTs were analyzed. Primary collateral grades (PCG) at baseline based on the integrity of Willis' circle were categorized into three degrees. The favorable outcomes, measured by modified Rankin scale (mRS), were defined as ≤2 at 90 days. The reperfusion was one of the most important confounders, defined as modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (mTICI) ≥ 2b. The other risk factors included demographic characteristics, vascular risk factors, stroke severity, procedural EVMT, and PCG at baseline was adjusted to reveal the association with favorable outcomes. RESULTS Of 38 iICAO patients, 65.8% (25 in 38) achieved reperfusion. However, only 31.6% (12/38) achieved favorable outcomes at 90 days. With a PCG3, 61.5% of them achieved favorable outcomes, while only 37.5% of those with PCG2 and PCG1 achieved favorable outcomes (p = .003). In multivariable logistic regression, PCG was revealed as a predictor for favorable outcomes (OR 5.278, p = .019) after adjusting the reperfusion and other factors. CONCLUSIONS The PCG based on the integrity of Willis' circle might be an underlying predictor of the prognosis of AIS in patients with iICAO after EVMT. The function of intact anterior communicating artery (AcoA) and ipsilateral posterior communicating artery (PcoA) in favoring prognosis of the iICAO patients might need to be validation in future study.","Zhao, Hongchen; Wang, Baolin; Xu, Ganggang; Dong, Yi; Dong, Qiang; Cao, Wenjie",Brain and behavior,https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.1452; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696661/,495

Little data exists on COVID-19 incidences and risk mitigation strategies in youth club sports. OBJECTIVE To determine the reported incidence of COVID-19 cases among youth club sport athletes and the information sources used to develop COVID-19 risk mitigation procedures. DESIGN Cross-sectional study. SETTING Online surveys. PATIENTS Soccer and volleyball youth club directors. INTERVENTION A survey was completed by directors of youth volleyball and soccer clubs across the country in October 2020. Surveys included self-reported date of re-initiation, number of players, player COVID-19 cases, sources of infection, COVID-19 mitigation strategies, and information sources for the development of COVID-19 mitigation strategies. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Total number of cases reported, number of players, and days since club re-initiation were used to calculate an incidence rate of cases per 100,000 player-days. To compare reported incidence rates between soccer and volleyball, a negative binomial model was developed to predict player cases with sport and state incidence as covariates and log(player-days) as an offset. Estimates were exponentiated to yield a reported incidence rate ratio (IRR) with Wald confidence intervals. RESULTS A total of 205,136 athletes (soccer=165,580; volleyball=39,556) were represented by 437 clubs (soccer=159; volleyball=278). Club organizers reported 673 COVID-19 cases (soccer=322; volleyball=351), for a reported incidence rate of 2.8 cases per 100,000 player-days (soccer=1.7, volleyball=7.9). Volleyball had a significantly higher reported COVID-19 incidence rate compared to soccer (reported IRR = 3.06 [2.0-4.6], p<0.001). Out of 11 possible mitigation strategies, the median number of strategies used by all clubs was 7 with an interquartile range of 2. CONCLUSIONS The incidence of self-reported cases of COVID-19 was lower in soccer clubs than volleyball clubs.

77293,Brachial Flow-Mediated Dilation and Risk of Atrial Fibrillation in Older Adults: The Cardiovascular Health Study.,2021,"BACKGROUND Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can be detected indirectly by measuring the host immune response. For some viruses, antibody concentrations correlate with host protection and viral neutralization, but in rare cases, antiviral antibodies can promote disease progression. Elucidation of the kinetics and magnitude of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response is essential to understand the pathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and identify potential therapeutic targets. METHODS Sera (n = 533) from patients with real-time polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 (n = 94 with acute infections and n = 59 convalescent patients) were tested using a high-throughput quantitative immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) assay that detects antibodies to the spike protein receptor binding domain and nucleocapsid protein. Individual and serial samples covered the time of initial diagnosis, during the disease course, and following recovery. We evaluated antibody kinetics and correlation between magnitude of the response and disease severity. RESULTS Patterns of SARS-CoV-2 antibody production varied considerably. Among 52 patients with 3 or more serial specimens, 44 (84.6%) and 42 (80.8%) had observed IgM and IgG seroconversion at a median of 8 and 10 days, respectively. Compared to those with milder disease, peak measurements were significantly higher for patients admitted to the intensive care unit for all time intervals between 6 and 20 days for IgM, and all intervals after 5 days for IgG. CONCLUSIONS High-sensitivity assays with a robust dynamic range provide a comprehensive picture of host antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. IgM and IgG responses were significantly higher in patients with severe than mild disease. These differences may affect strategies for seroprevalence studies, therapeutics, and vaccine development.","Lynch, Kara L; Whitman, Jeffrey D; Lacanienta, Noreen P; Beckerdite, Erica W; Kastner, Shannon A; Shy, Brian R; Goldgof, Gregory M; Levine, Andrew G; Bapat, Sagar P; Stramer, Susan L; Esensten, Jonathan H; Hightower, Allen W; Bern, Caryn; Wu, Alan H B",Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa979; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33543254/,495
77752,Continuous Glucose Monitors and Automated Insulin Dosing Systems in the Hospital Consensus Guideline.,2020-09-28,"SUMMARY Hospital and health system leaders alike are increasing their efforts to implement an ambulatory care strategy. The move is understandable: Innovative and well-funded competitors are entering their markets, payers are demanding lower-cost options, and patients are seeking affordability and convenience.Healthcare organizations must consider several imperatives when identifying a long-term ambulatory strategy that is both successful and sustainable. The rise of value-based care and emerging market and competitive trends are among the important considerations that call for a strategy that is affordable, responds to consumer expectations, and ensures that care is coordinated and optimal.Penn Medicine Lancaster General Health (LG Health) strategically transformed its ambulatory services over three decades. Early on, the system focused on providing services in and around its urban flagship hospital. Increased competition, new technologies, market growth, and other influences eventually led the system to expand its depth and breadth while aggregating many of its ambulatory services in a single suburban location designed to optimize efficiency, prioritize clinical coordination, and enhance patient and physician satisfaction.The system built on that foundation by creating a network of ambulatory locations featuring four service delivery models. Each features distinct facility sizes, physician types, patient groups, and services. In addition, LG Health continues to build the technological and operational capabilities to deliver telehealth services that have become more established in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.The investments made, experiences studied, and lessons learned by LG Health since 1990 and during the uncertain course of the current pandemic continue to guide its ambulatory strategy.","Bergen, Jan L; Wynne, Susan",Frontiers of health services management,https://doi.org/10.1097/hap.0000000000000098; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33555813/,495

Good (moderate) outcome was defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 2 (0-3) assessed after at least 3 months (median time to follow-up = 120 days). RESULTS Thirty-four percent had good and 42% had moderate clinical outcome; mortality was 35%. TICI 2b-3 recanalization was achieved by 79%. Age, hypertension, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores, collateral status, and the use of magnetic resonance imaging prior to EVT predicted clinical outcome, the latter 3 remaining independent predictors in multivariate analysis. Independent predictors of recanalization were better collateral status and the use of a stent retriever. However, recanalization did not significantly predict clinical outcome. INTERPRETATION Beside initial stroke severity, the collateral status predicts clinical outcome and recanalization in BA occlusion. Our data suggest that the use of a stent retriever is associated with high recanalization rates, but recanalization on its own does not predict outcome. The role of other modifiable factors, including the choice of pretreatment imaging modality and time issues, warrants further investigation.","Singer, Oliver C; Berkefeld, Joachim; Nolte, Christian H; Bohner, Georg; Haring, Hans-Peter; Trenkler, Johannes; Gröschel, Klaus; Müller-Forell, Wibke; Niederkorn, Kurt; Deutschmann, Hannes; Neumann-Haefelin, Tobias; Hohmann, Carina; Bussmeyer, Matthias; Mpotsaris, Anastasios; Stoll, Anett; Bormann, Albrecht; Brenck, Johannes; Schlamann, Marc U; Jander, Sebastian; Turowski, Bernd; Petzold, Gabor C; Urbach, Horst; Liebeskind, David S",Annals of neurology,https://doi.org/10.1002/ana.24336; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25516154/,495
77838,Survey of Dental Clinicians for Attitude and Use of Torque-Limiting Devices.,2021,"OBJECTIVES Acute Recanalization of Thrombo-Embolic Ischemic Stroke with pREset (ARTESp) is a prospective multicenter study assessing the efficacy and safety of the pREset stent retriever for the treatment of intracranial vessel occlusion. Determination of the effect of transfer status on clinical outcome was a secondary objective. METHODS Efficacy was measured by recanalization success (Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score ≥2b) and favorable clinical outcome at 90 days (modified Rankin Scale 0-2). Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and death at 90 days were safety measures. The outcome of directly admitted (DAP) and transferred (TP) patients was investigated using multivariable regression models. RESULTS Four study centers included 100 patients (mean age 68.3 years, median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score 15). Recanalization success was achieved in 84.4% after a mean of 1.7 passes. ICH was detected in 14.0%, with 2.0% being symptomatic. At 90 days, 62.5% of the patients had a favorable outcome and 7.3% died. TP had longer occlusion times (289 vs 180 minutes, p<0.001) and a lower rate of favorable outcome (58.0% vs 78.4%, p=0.046) than DAP. Multivariable regression revealed occlusion time as the critical determinant (OR=0.963, 95% CI 0.931 to 0.997, p=0.032), whereas transfer status itself showed no significant association (OR=0.565, CI 0.133 to 2.393, p=0.438). CONCLUSIONS pREset proved to be safe and effective for the treatment of acute intracranial vessel occlusion. Increased occlusion time impaired clinical outcome in TP.

METHODS Cross-sectional study conducted using an instrument made available in social networks with 1,106 health professionals. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and compared, considering pvalue < 0.05. RESULTS There was a prevalence of 69.4% for pressure injuries related to the use of personal protective equipment, with an average of 2.4 injuries per professional. The significant factors were: under 35 years of age, working and wearing personal protective equipment for more than six hours a day, in hospital units, and without the use of inputs for protection. CONCLUSION Pressure injuries related to the use of medical devices showed a high prevalence in this population.

79842,Perspectives on Pediatric Redeployment During COVID-19 From an Emergency Department in New York City.,2020-07-13,"BACKGROUND Arthroplasty payment traditionally includes 118 minutes for postoperative rounds and 69 minutes for postoperative office visits, amounting to 187 minutes and 7 work relative value units. Rapid recovery, ambulatory procedures, and bundled payments have altered the burden of care, with multiple studies showing an increase in physician work. Policy changes during the COVID-19 pandemic allow for precise documentation of patient touchpoints. We analyzed the duration of video, telephone, and text messaging to quantify modern arthroplasty work. METHODS Consecutive primary hip, knee, and partial knee arthroplasties, performed 30 days before March 15, 2020 (date of practice closure), were included from a single institution, yielding 47 cases. We retrospectively quantified the duration of video telehealth documentation, telephone logs, and text messages over 90 days to calculate the postoperative work required in modern arthroplasty using descriptive statistics. RESULTS An average of 9.4 touchpoints (2-14) by the surgeons occurred during the global period for this cohort, totaling 219 minutes (51-247 minutes). This included an average of 21 minutes of day-0 calls to family, 117 minutes for video visits, 52 minutes for phone calls, and 29 minutes for text messaging and wound photos. CONCLUSION We found an undervaluation of 32 minutes of work. AAHKS leadership advocates for the fair payment of modern arthroplasty work. Cell phones have opened channels of contact that did not exist before, including phone accessibility, text messaging, and video calls.

81661,Infection Control and Vaccine Hesitancy in the Emergency Department.,2020-11-01,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among the world, while the advance of TBI management is rather limited in recent years. The deregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been widely reported in TBI patients and animal models, and certain miRNAs have been identified as the emerging biomarkers of TBI. However, the role of miRNAs in the regulatory mechanism of TBI remains unclear. To demonstrate the effect of miR-146a mimic on TBI-induced neural damages, TBI mouse model was constructed by cortical impact injury (CCI). The chemokine levels were examined by ELISA assays. Behavioral experiments were used to estimate the impact of miR-146a mimics on neurological functions in mice. Western blot assays were performed to demonstrate the protein levels. qRT-PCR assays were utilized to investigate the expression alteration of RNA levels. It was found that miR-146a was upregulated both in brain and serum in TBI mice. miR-146a mimic downregulated inflammatory cytokines secretion in mouse brain. The NF-κB signaling pathway was inhibited by miR-146a mimic. miR-146a treatment attenuated the impact caused by TBI to mouse brain and improve the long-term neurological function. In conclusion, miR-146a mimics ameliorate TBI-related injuries via JNK and NF-κB signaling pathway.","Zhang, Lei; Zhao, Li; Zhu, Wei; Ding, Yuexia; Chen, Hongguang; Chi, Nan",Neuromolecular medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12017-020-08599-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388802/,495

82758,Caring for the Caregivers During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-08-25,"OBJECTIVE We sought to compare outcomes after two surgical approaches for the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF): a minimally invasive, staged hybrid approach combining surgery with catheter ablation, [Hybrid Maze (HM)] and the classic cut and sew Maze (CM). METHODS From April 2004 to March 2010, 63 stand-alone AF procedures were performed by two surgeons at a single center and followed up for ≥6 months. CM was offered to all patients. After July 2007, patients were also prospectively offered a two-stage HM: stage 1 = a beating heart bipolar radiofrequency pulmonary vein isolation and left atrial appendage ligation; stage 2 = transvenous catheter ablation connecting the pulmonary veins to each other and the mitral annulus when AF was present after stage 1. Outcomes were compared between 25 HM and 38 CM using χ or Fisher exact test analysis. RESULTS Postoperatively, there was no difference in 30-day mortality (0%), complications (4% HM vs. 18% CM), or median length of stay (5 days). At last follow-up, 88% of HM and 95% of CM were free from AF; 80% of HM and 90% of CM were free from AF and antiarrhythmic medication (P ≥ 0.3). Twenty-nine percent of HM required a subsequent catheter ablation (stage 2) when compared with 8% of the CM patients (P = 0.04). Freedom from AF and antiarrhythmic medication at 1 year was 52% for the HM and 87.5% for the CM (P = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS In AF patients reluctant to undergo a CM but willing to undergo subsequent catheter ablation, a minimally invasive approach is a reasonable strategy. Because pulmonary vein isolation alone may be sufficient in two-thirds of patients and delayed reconnection is common, an interval two-stage hybrid approach may prove preferable over a one-stage combined hybrid approach; however, successful sinus restoration may take longer with this approach.","Lee, Richard; McCarthy, Patrick M; Passman, Rod S; Kruse, Jane; Malaisrie, S Chris; McGee, Edwin C; Lapin, Brittany; Jacobson, Jason T; Goldberger, Jeffrey; Knight, Bradley P",Innovations,https://doi.org/10.1097/imi.0b013e318248f3f4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22436772/,495

PURPOSE This case report describes utilization of thromboelastography (TEG) in the setting of an acute major bleed in a patient on dabigatran who had concomitant acute kidney injury. SUMMARY An 80-year-old female presented to the emergency department after a fall with complaints of pain in her knee, shoulder, and hip. Her medical history was significant for coronary artery disease, for which she took clopidogrel 75 mg daily, and atrial fibrillation, for which she took dabigatran 150 mg twice daily. The physical exam was remarkable for pain within the shoulder, hip, and knee, which had swelling and ecchymosis that extended into the right thigh. Given the possibility of compartment syndrome with multiple possible etiologies of coagulopathy, TEG and computed tomography angiography (CTa) of the right lower extremity were performed. The initial TEG showed prolonged R time and activated clotting time, indicating clotting factor dysfunction with no additional coagulopathy noted, including antiplatelet effects. On the basis of the TEG and CTa findings, it was decided to reverse dabigatran with 5 grams of idarucizumab. Approximately 1 hour after administration of idarucizumab, the patient was taken to interventional radiology where a limited angiogram of the right lower extremity showed no active extravasation. Because of the patient's renal dysfunction and the possibility of rebound hypercoaguability, repeat TEG tests were ordered at 4 and 8 hours after the initial reversal to ensure clearance of idarucizumab-dabigatran complexes. The repeat TEG values showed complete reversal of the initial coagulopathy noted. During the admission, the patient required no blood transfusions or surgical interventions and all her initial laboratory results improved. CONCLUSION Serial TEG testing was successful at managing multiple coagulopathies in a patient at risk for trauma-induced compartment syndrome.","Gilbert, Brian W; Ott, Jacob M; Philip, George J",American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists,https://doi.org/10.1093/ajhp/zxab182; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33895798/,495
83338,Repeat-dose steady-state pharmacokinetic evaluation of once-daily hydromorphone extended-release (OROS(®) hydromorphone ER) in patients with chronic pain.,2012,"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic adrenalectomy has become the standard procedure for treating patents with adrenal masses. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of the LigaSure vessel closure system during laparoscopic adrenalectomy. METHODS The LigaSure device was used in 32 patients undergoing laparoscopic adrenalectomy for adrenal masses. Adrenalectomy was carried out without the use of clips or sutures for vessel closure. In 1 patient the adrenal tumor had invaded the ipsilateral kidney, so laparoscopic nephrectomy was also carried out during the same operation. In another patient, a renal cell carcinoma in the left kidney had metastasized to the right adrenal gland. Both the kidney and the contralateral adrenal gland were removed laparoscopically during the same operation. RESULTS Adrenal masses had a mean greatest diameter of 3.48 cm (range 2 to 11 cm). Mean operative time was 83.2 minutes (range 30 to 190 min). Mean blood loss was 36.2 mL (range 10 to 140 mL). No conversions to open surgery were necessary. No patients experienced major bleeding intraoperatively or postoperatively. Adrenal tumor types included adrenocortical adenoma (16 patients), pheochromocytoma (13 patients), malignant pheochromocytoma (1 patient), chromophobic carcinoma (1 patient), and metastasis from a renal cell carcinoma (1 patient). CONCLUSIONS For vessel closure during laparoscopic adrenalectomy, the LigaSure device seems to be safe and effective. For patients with conditions such as renal cell carcinoma combined with metastasis to the contralateral adrenal gland, nephrectomy, and contralateral adrenalectomy can be carried out during the same laparoscopic operation.","Surgit, Onder","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",https://doi.org/10.1097/sle.0b013e3181ced190; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20393338/,495

Single-dose administration may cause elevated blood glucose levels in obese adults. No data are available for children. OBJECTIVE The aim was to evaluate perioperative blood glucose changes related to body weight in children who received dexamethasone. PATIENTS AND METHODS This prospective observational study included 62 children. All patients received total intravenous anesthesia and a single dose of dexamethasone (0.15 mg/kg, maximum 8 mg). Blood glucose levels were measured up to 6 h. Standard deviation scores (SDS) were calculated using age- and gender-specific body mass index (BMI) percentiles, p<0.05. RESULTS A total of 62 children (11.5±2.9 years, median SDS 0.43, 29% overweight/obese) were included. Blood glucose levels increased from 5.52±0.52 to 6.74±0.84 mmol/L 6 h after dexamethasone without correlation to the BMI-SDS. CONCLUSIONS This study showed an increase of perioperative blood glucose (normoglycemic ranges) after single dose of dexamethasone, but no BMI-dependent effect was observed in children. Therefore, low-dose dexamethasone may be used in obese children for PONV prophylaxis.","Gnatzy, Richard; Hempel, Gunther; Kaisers, Udo X; Höhne, Claudia",Journal of pediatric endocrinology & metabolism : JPEM,https://doi.org/10.1515/jpem-2014-0529; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26197463/,495
83911,"COVID-19, Prison Visits, and the Value of a Cup of Coffee.",2020-06-02,"BACKGROUND Conventional open procedures have been supplanted in part by less invasive approaches, such as laparoscopic surgery developed for treating gastrointestinal malignancies. However, it is unclear whether laparoscopy-assisted gastric tube reconstruction (LAGT) can attenuate the postoperative systemic inflammatory response after esophagectomy for esophageal cancer. METHODS We investigated the postoperative clinical course of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) in patients who underwent an esophagectomy for esophageal cancer by LAGT (LAGT group) and gastric tube reconstruction by conventional open surgery (Open group). RESULTS Compared with the Open group, the LAGT group had a significantly shorter operative time (539.6 min vs. 639.8 min), shorter duration of postoperative mechanical ventilation (1.1 days vs. 2.8 days), and shorter length of stay in the intensive care unit (2.1 days vs. 4.4 days). The LAGT group also had a significantly shorter SIRS duration (1.4 days vs. 2.7 days), a significantly lower incidence of SIRS, and a smaller number of positive SIRS criteria. Throughout the investigation period, the postoperative white blood cell count was lower in the LAGT group than in the Open group. Additionally, in the LAGT group, the heart rate was lower on each postoperative day (POD), and the respiratory rate was significantly lower on postoperative days (PODs) 1 and 4. There was no difference in postoperative oxygenation, morbidity, and mortality between the groups. The C-reactive protein level on PODs 3 and 4 was significantly lower in the LAGT group than in the Open group. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopy-assisted gastric tube reconstruction significantly attenuates postoperative SIRS, and it is therefore a potentially less invasive surgical procedure.","Tsujimoto, Hironori; Ono, Satoshi; Sugasawa, Hidekazu; Ichikura, Takashi; Yamamoto, Junji; Hase, Kazuo",World journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-010-0757-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20703457/,495

This study aimed to investigate the association between insomnia, academic performance, self-reported health, physical activity, school start time, and substance use among adolescents. METHODS A survey with a cross-sectional design was completed by adolescents (15-17 years old; n = 1504) in southern Sweden. The Minimal Insomnia Symptoms Scale (MISS) was used to operationalize insomnia. A multiple logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the relationship between insomnia and self-reported health, failed school courses, substance use, school start time, family financial situation, screen time, and gender. RESULTS Insomnia (MISS ≥ 6) was associated with poor self-reported health (OR: 4.35), failed school courses (OR: 1.47), and use of alcohol and/or cigarettes (OR: 1.43). When the combined effect of self-reported health and physical activity were investigated, a combination of low physical activity (≤1 time/week) and poor self-reported health was strongly associated with insomnia (OR: 18.87). CONCLUSIONS Insomnia was associated with other problems that in themselves are risk factors for poor health. This highlights the need for a holistic health-promoting approach to prevent insomnia, such as efforts to promote physical activity, school success, and the reduction of alcohol/cigarette use.","Hedin, Gita; Norell-Clarke, Annika; Hagell, Peter; Tønnesen, Hanne; Westergren, Albert; Garmy, Pernilla",International journal of environmental research and public health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17176433; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32899407/,495

This review examines the literature on influenza and noninfluenza viruses in the SOT recipient. RECENT FINDINGS Advances in immunosuppression and antimicrobial prophylaxis have led to improved patient and graft survival, yet respiratory viruses continue to be a common cause of disease in this population. Influenza viruses have received top priority regarding prevention and treatment, whereas advances in molecular diagnostic tests detecting an array of other respiratory viruses have expanded our knowledge about the epidemiology and impact of these viruses in both the general population and SOT patients. Effective treatment and prevention for noninfluenza respiratory viruses are only emerging. SUMMARY Respiratory viruses can contribute to a wide array of symptoms in SOT, particularly in lung transplant recipients. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment options for influenza and noninfluenza viruses in SOT patients are reviewed. PCR and related molecular techniques represent the most sensitive diagnostic modalities for detection of respiratory viruses. Early therapy is associated with improved outcomes. Newer classes of antivirals and antibodies are under continuous development for many of these community acquired respiratory viruses.","Nam, Hannah H; Ison, Michael G",Current opinion in organ transplantation,https://doi.org/10.1097/mot.0000000000000663; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31145157/,495

87079,Annals for Hospitalists Inpatient Notes - Remdesivir-Making Sense of Emerging Evidence.,2020-12-15,"The cannabinoid signaling system regulates intraocular pressure (IOP) in the mouse via a complex system that includes three receptors: CB1, GPR18 and GPR119. In each case, activating the receptor lowers IOP, but CB1 receptors are found both at sites of aqueous humor inflow and outflow. As such, knockout mice for any of these receptors would be expected to have higher-than average, or at least unchanged, intraocular pressure. The current study investigates the unexpected observation that CB1 knockout mice have lower pressure than wild type counterparts by testing various regulators of cannabinoid signaling in murine models of IOP. We now report that a CB1 antagonist has differential effects on IOP: SR141716 raises IOP in standard light cycle (SLC) but lowers IOP in reverse light cycle (RLC). This is mimicked by ABD1085, a negative allosteric modulator of CB1. CB1 inhibitors lower IOP in both normotensive and hypertensive mouse eyes. The pressure-lowering effect is absent in CB1 knockout mice. IOP rebounds after the end of treatment but shows no sign of desensitization with daily treatment for a week. Unlike the positive cannabinoid effect, antagonist effects are not sex-dependent. We propose that there are two mechanisms of action for CB1, one that lowers IOP upon activation and a second with inverse sign that lowers IOP when CB1 is antagonized. The relatively lower pressure in CB1 knockout mouse eyes suggests that this second negative regulation of IOP is dominant.","Miller, Sally; Daily, Laura; Ploss, Maya; Greig, Iain; Ross, Ruth; Rayana, Naga Pradeep; Dai, Jiannong; Sugali, Chenna Kesavulu; Mao, Weiming; Straiker, Alex",Experimental eye research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exer.2020.108241; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32941875/,495

87835,Prognostic factors for persistent symptoms in adults with mild traumatic brain injury: protocol for an overview of systematic reviews.,2021-09-23,"BACKGROUND Wound closure is one of the crucial aspects of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) for patients who perform high-flexion activities of daily living, because the joint capsule is highly stretched and integrity of the arthrotomy closure must be maintained. Watertightness of the knee joint is a different aspect of the repair integrity of arthrotomy closure and is being noticed with increasing usage of the drain clamp method for blood management after TKA. Recently, the barbed knotless suture has been growing in popularity as a strong, secure closure appropriate for high-tension areas, such as the fascia and joint capsule. The purpose of this study was to compare the barbed knotless suture with simple interrupted suture in cadaveric knees. METHODS Nine fresh-frozen cadaveric lower extremities were used. After placing a parapatellar incision and setting a closed suction drain, arthrotomies were closed randomly using three suture materials: simple interrupted absorbable suture (No. 0 PDS, group C); or a single running knotless barbed suture Stratafix with 8N (group BS-8N) or 15N (group BS-15N) of tension. After arthrotomy closure, saline was injected in a retrograde manner into the joint through a drain until saline started to leak from the joint. Peak values for intra-articular pressure and infusion volume in each group were recorded and compared. RESULTS Mean infusion volumes were 13.0 ± 7.2 ml, 38.6 ± 10.7 ml, and 5.1 ± 2.5 ml in groups BS-8N, BS-15N, and C, respectively. Mean intra-articular pressures were 0.67 ± 0.47 kPa, 9.44 ± 4.55 kPa, and 0.56 ± 0.44 kPa in groups BS-8N, BS-15N, and C, respectively. Infusion volume and joint internal pressure were significantly higher in group BS-15N than in groups BS-8N (p = 0.008) or C (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS Barbed suture with 15N appears appropriate for maintaining maximal watertightness after knee joint capsule closure, offering successful drain clamping, higher resistance to early mobilization protocols, and subsequent achievement of early deep knee flexion after TKA.","Kobayashi, Shu; Niki, Yasuo; Harato, Kengo; Udagawa, Kazuhiko; Matsumoto, Morio; Nakamura, Masaya",Journal of orthopaedic surgery and research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13018-018-1035-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30572958/,495

While different containment policies using nonpharmaceutical interventions have been applied, their time evolution and efficiency are not known quantitatively. We show here that the measure of the doubling time Td(t) is a reliable tool for early predictions of epidemic spread time evolution following mitigation, which is needed for planning methods to overcome critical health care need. The doubling time Td(t) curves over the epidemic dome full time width provide a quantitative measure of the success of different containment measures. The efficiency of the Lockdown case Finding mobile Tracing (LFT) policy using modern technologies is found to be much higher than the traditional Lockdown Stop and Go (LSG) policy using the success s factor. A low s factor, the characteristic time of the exponential growing Td(t) in the arrested regime, was reached by LFT policy giving the lowest number of deaths and the shorter time width of the epidemic dome. The record for the largest number of fatalities in USA is correlated with the largest s factor in the near threshold regime when any containment measures were enforced by government in due time. LFT policy has been able to reduce both intensity and time width of the Covid-19 pandemic dome achieving both a low number of fatalities and lower economic losses.","Bianconi, Antonio; Marcelli, Augusto; Campi, Gaetano; Perali, Andrea",Physical biology,https://doi.org/10.1088/1478-3975/abac51; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32750685/,495

Various modified procedures for the IEJS have been devised, but an optimal method has not yet been standardized. A total of 32 consecutive patients (23 men and 9 women) underwent TLTGs for gastric cancer, between December of 2009 and December of 2014 at the Iwate Medical University Hospital, and were enrolled in this study. Here, we report our institution's experience with TLTGs, with changes in the IEJS. The study participants had a mean age of 66.8 years and a body mass index of 22.8 kg/m2. The mean operation time and blood loss were 356.1 min and 61.2 mL, respectively. According to the IEJS, there were 6 circular stapler (CS) (single and double stapling techniques) and 26 linear stapler (LS) (overlap technique and functional end-to-end anastomosis) procedures performed. Two patients, who had undergone IEJS by double stapling technique, developed anastomotic stenosis and required endoscopic balloon dilatations of the anastomotic sites. Therefore, we changed to LS to secure the abundant anastomotic diameter. In our institute, some problematic complications in the IEJS procedure occurred at the introduction of the TLTG. We have overcome these complications by changing and standardizing the IEJS techniques, and by cultivating the laparoscopic techniques.","Umemura, Akira; Koeda, Keisuke; Fujiwara, Hisataka; Chiba, Takehiro; Otsuka, Koki; Sasaki, Akira",The Indian journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12262-016-1471-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27358526/,495

89903,The Role of Telehealth in Sideline Management of Sports-Related Injuries.,2021-02-01,"AIMS Fluid congestion is a leading cause of hospital admission, readmission, and mortality in heart failure (HF). We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the effectiveness of an advanced fluid management programme (AFMP). The AFMP was defined as an intervention providing tailored diuretic therapy guided by intravascular volume assessment, in hospitalized patients or after discharge. The AFMP group was compared with patients who received standard care treatment. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine the effectiveness of an AFMP in improving patient outcomes. METHODS AND RESULTS A systematic review of randomized controlled trials, case-control studies, and crossover studies using the terms 'heart failure', 'fluid management', and 'readmission' was conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, and Scopus up until November 2020. Studies reporting the association of an AFMP on readmission and/or mortality were included in our meta-analyses. Risk of bias was assessed in non-randomized studies using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. From 232 retrieved studies, 12 were included in the data synthesis. The 6040 patients in the included studies had a mean age of 72 ± 4 years and mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 39 ± 8%, there were slightly more men (n = 3022) than women, and the follow-up period was a mean of 4.8 ± 3.1 months. Readmission data were available in 5362 patients; of these, 1629 were readmitted. Mortality data were available in 5787 patients; of these, 584 died. HF patients who had an AFMP in hospital and/or after discharge had lower odds of all-cause readmission (odds ratio-OR 0.64 [95% confidence interval-CI 0.44, 0.92], P = 0.02) with moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 46.5) and lower odds of all-cause mortality (OR 0.82 [95% CI 0.69, 0.98], P = 0.03) with low heterogeneity (I2 = 0). The use of an AFMP was equally effective in reducing readmission and mortality regardless of age and follow-up duration. Effective pre-discharge diuresis was associated with significantly lower readmission odds (OR 0.43 [95% CI 0.26, 0.71], P = 0.001) compared with a fluid management plan as part of post-discharge follow-up. CONCLUSIONS An effective AFMP is associated with improving readmission and mortality in HF. Our results encourage attainment of optimal volume status at discharge and prescription of optimal diuretic dose. Ongoing support to maintain euvolaemia and effective collaboration between healthcare teams, along with effective patient education and engagement, may help to reduce adverse outcomes in HF patients.","Zisis, Georgios; Halabi, Amera; Huynh, Quan; Neil, Christopher; Carrington, Melinda; Marwick, Thomas H",ESC heart failure,https://doi.org/10.1002/ehf2.13510; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34296530/,495
90675,Interventions for improving self-direction in people with dementia: a systematic review.,2021-03-20,"OBJECTIVES Lobectomies done by video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) result in fewer complications and less pain and save total costs compared with the traditional approach. However, the majority of procedures are still performed via open thoracotomies, because VATS lobectomy is considered difficult to learn, requiring experience in open surgery, and causing complications in the initial phase of the learning curve. The aim of this study was to describe a training model appreciating patient safety during training and to explore the initial learning curve for a trainee rather inexperienced in open surgery. METHODS A trainee who had performed 14 lobectomies by thoracotomy was enrolled in a training programme at a high-volume VATS centre. The training model included courses and simulations followed by the selection of suitable patients operated on during close expert supervision. Data regarding time, a variety of quality indicators and complications were collected prospectively and compared with experts' performance. RESULTS Over 12 months, 29 of 214 VATS lobectomies were performed by the trainee. Twice, the supervisor had to finish the procedure due to technical difficulties. None of the operations were converted to open thoracotomy. Compared with experts, the trainee operated significantly slower [median 120 (range 74-160) vs 100 (range 42-255) min, P = 0.04]; had similar perioperative bleeding [median 100 (range 10-500) vs 50 (range 5-2500) ml, P = 0.79]; had earlier chest tube removal [median 1 (range 1-6) vs 2 (range 1-32) postoperative days, P < 0.001]; and reduced hospital stay [median 3 (range 1-10) vs 4 (range 1-41) days, P < 0.001]. Twenty-three (79%) patients had no complications, while 2 had atrial fibrillation. Pneumothorax after chest tube removal, incisional infection, prolonged pain and need for pleuracentesis were each seen once. CONCLUSIONS With thorough preparation of trainees and training on selected patients under close supervision, the learning curve can be overcome with good results even if the trainee has limited prior experience in open surgery.","Konge, Lars; Petersen, René Horsleben; Hansen, Henrik Jessen; Ringsted, Charlotte",Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1093/icvts/ivs405; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22968956/,495

Surgical thrombectomy was once the only option in severe cases in which limbs were threatened, but thrombus removal is no longer restricted to emergency cases. Interventional radiologists are now using advanced endovascular techniques to achieve thrombus removal in a minimally invasive manner in a very short treatment time, thereby quickly restoring patency, relieving acute symptoms, and potentially limiting the subsequent development of postthrombotic syndrome when followed with anticoagulation and compression regimens.

91694,Battlefield Endocrinology.,2020-06-02,"Nrf2 is an important transcription factor involved in the antioxidant response and is widely expressed in animal tissues. The function of Nrf2 is regulated by its negative regulator Keap1 by inducing its cytoplasmic degradation. Recent studies have suggested that Nrf2 is also regulated post-transcriptionally via miRNAs. However, to date, how miRNAs regulate Nrf2 in fish skeletal muscles is unknown. In this study, the full-length cDNAs with 2398 bp of the Nrf2 was firstly cloned by SMART RACE amplification tools from Chinese perch. The Nrf2 gene structure and its 3'-UTR region for possible miRNA binding sites, as well as its spatial expression profile were assayed. Then, we employed TargetScan Fish tool MiRNAnome to predict putative sites for five miRNAs including miR-181a-5p, MiR-194a, MiR-216a, miR-459-5p, and miR-724. Using qRT-PCR assay, we found that Nrf2 mRNA levels have negative correlation with all five miRNAs expression in muscle of nutritionally deprived fish, and that ectopic expression of miR-181a-5p alone reduces Nrf2 mRNA levels. Luciferase reporter assay in a heterologous cell system revealed that each of the five miRNAs reduced Nrf2 expression, suggesting a direct regulatory mechanism. Moreover, the miR-181a-5p suppression using specific antagomir led to a significant increase in Nrf2 expression in vivo. At the same time, the expression levels of the antioxidant enzymes CAT, ZnSOD, GPx, GSTA, and GSTA genes increased significantly after injecting miR-181a-5p antagomir. Taken together, these findings provide evidence that miRNAs are involved in the Nrf2 signaling networks in regulation of oxidative stress in fish, at least in Chinese perch muscle.","Wu, Ping; Chen, Lin; Cheng, Jia; Pan, Yaxiong; Guo, Xinhong; Chu, Wuying; Zhang, Jianshe; Liu, Xuanming",Marine biotechnology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10126-020-09982-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839828/,495

SUMMARY INTRODUCTION The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused global public health and economic crises. OBJECTIVE The aim of this observation study was to estimate the effectiveness, safety and elicited immune response of the BNT162b2 mRNA Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in healthcare workers of the Buda Hospital of the Hospitaller Order of St. John of God. METHOD After vaccination, the infection rate, adverse events and the kinetics of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein antibodies were evaluated. RESULTS Before vaccination, from the 295 healthcare workers 36 recovered from prior COVID-19 infection (COVID-19-positive group). After the second vaccination, there was no COVID-19 infection during the three-month follow-up period. The adverse events were mild. In the COVID-19-positive group, the median cut-off index of anti-N antibodies measured at 4 weeks after the first vaccination were significantly (p<0.0001) higher (28.37) than in the COVID-19-negative group (0.085). After the first vaccine, the median titer of anti-S antibodies was significantly higher (p<0.0001) in the COVID-19-positive group (8015 U/ml) compared to the COVID-19-negative group (23.18 U/ml). In the COVID-19-negative group, the median titer of anti-S antibodies increased significantly (p<0.0001) after the second vaccine (from 23.18 U/ml to 1173 U/ml), showing an increase of 500×. CONCLUSIONS After the second vaccination, there was no COVID-19 infection during the follow-up. In the COVID-19-negative group, the anti-S antibody titer is moderate after the first vaccination and increases significantly after the second vaccine. In the COVID-19-positive group, the first vaccine induces significant anti-S antibody production.

BMS-791325 inhibits recombinant NS5B proteins from HCV genotypes 1, 3, 4, and 5 at 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) below 28 nM. In cell culture, BMS-791325 inhibited replication of HCV subgenomic replicons representing genotypes 1a and 1b at 50% effective concentrations (EC50s) of 3 nM and 6 nM, respectively, with similar (3 to 18 nM) values for genotypes 3a, 4a, and 5a. Potency against genotype 6a showed more variability (9 to 125 nM), and activity was weaker against genotype 2 (EC50, 87 to 925 nM). Specificity was demonstrated by the absence of activity (EC50s of >4 μM) against a panel of mammalian viruses, and cytotoxic concentrations (50%) were >3,000-fold above the HCV EC50. Resistance substitutions selected by BMS-791325 in genotype 1 replicons mostly mapped to a single site, NS5B amino acid 495 (P495A/S/L/T). Additive or synergistic activity was observed in combination studies using BMS-791325 with alfa interferon plus ribavirin, inhibitors of NS3 protease or NS5A, and other classes of NS5B inhibitor (palm site 2-binding or nucleoside analogs). Plasma and liver exposures in vivo in several animal species indicated that BMS-791325 has a hepatotropic disposition (liver-to-plasma ratios ranging from 1.6- to 60-fold across species). Twenty-four hours postdose, liver exposures across all species tested were ≥ 10-fold above the inhibitor EC50s observed with HCV genotype 1 replicons.

93462,"Translation, Cross-Cultural Adaptation, and Validation of the Pain Sensitivity Questionnaire in Dutch Healthy Volunteers.",2020,"BACKGROUND Impacts of early childhood development (ECD) interventions (such as fostering attachment and responsiveness through communication, play and stimulation) are well known. Globally, there is increasing recognition of the importance of the 'golden' minutes, hours and days after birth for infant health and development. However, only one systematic review has examined ECD interventions implemented in the neonatal period (0-27 days), and this review only assessed interventions implemented by specialised providers. Primary care providers have many potential contacts with mothers and infants throughout the neonatal period. However, it is unclear how many research studies or programmes have examined the effectiveness of ECD interventions commencing in the neonatal period and which methods were used. To date, there has been no systematic review of the effect of ECD interventions delivered by primary care providers commencing in the neonatal period. METHODS Our overall aim is to conduct a systematic review of the effect of ECD interventions implemented by primary care providers in the neonatal period. We will assess effects by timing and number ('dose') of contacts with primary care providers. Subgroup assessment will include effects in disadvantaged infants such as those born with low birth weight and to mothers with mental health disorders. We will also assess effects in low- and high-income countries and by type of care provider. The primary outcome is cognitive status in children aged 0-23 months as measured using standardised scales. Secondary outcomes include other child neurodevelopment domains (speech, language, fine motor, gross motor, social, emotional, behaviour, executive functioning, adaptive functioning) in children aged 0-23 months. Effects on maternal mental health will also be assessed between 0-23 months postpartum. Databases such as MEDLINE (OVID), PsycINFO (OVID), EMBASE (OVID), CINAHL, Cochrane Library, WHO databases and reference lists of papers will be searched for relevant articles. Only randomised controlled trials will be included. A narrative synthesis for all outcomes will be reported. Meta-analyses will be performed where exposures and outcomes are sufficiently homogeneous. Guidelines for PRISMA-P (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols) will be followed. DISCUSSION This review appears to be the first to be conducted in this area. The findings will be an important resource for policymakers, primary care providers and researchers who work with young infants in primary care settings.

95307,"Improving Surgical Cancer Care: A Rising Tide May Lift All Boats, Yet Inequity Persists.",2020-12-01,"International medical school graduates (IMGs) play a vital role in the health care system of the United States. They constitute roughly one-quarter of the physician workforce, comprising a significant proportion of the primary care providers in high-need rural and urban areas, where they provide equal and, in some instances, better care than U.S. graduates. Nonetheless, they face a series of hurdles in entering U.S. residency programs and throughout their training experiences.IMGs must expend significant resources to obtain Education Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG) certification, which includes Steps 1, 2 Clinical Knowledge (CK), and 2 Clinical Skills (CS) of the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE). They encounter the uncertainty of matching and, if successful, obtaining a visa to enter the U.S. Once here, they need to adapt to the complexities of the health care system and familiarize themselves with the cultural nuances, professional behaviors, and communication skills of another country. They encounter biases and microaggressions and lack support groups and mentors. Those who choose an academic career are less likely to obtain leadership positions.This Perspective provides an overview of these challenges and highlights opportunities for change at local and national levels. Specifically, it identifies strategies that would assist IMGs before entry, at entry, during training, at the transition to practice, and in practice. The current COVID-19 pandemic highlights the shortage of physicians in the U.S. and illustrates the importance of ensuring that IMGs, who are essential health care workers, feel welcome, valued, and recognized for their contributions.","Zaidi, Zareen; Dewan, Mantosh; Norcini, John",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,https://doi.org/10.1097/acm.0000000000003694; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32889932/,495

To better understand the role of bats in its origin, we examined the molecular epidemiology and evolution of lineage C betacoronaviruses among bats. Ty-BatCoV HKU4 and Pi-BatCoV HKU5 were detected in 29% and 25% of alimentary samples from lesser bamboo bat (Tylonycteris pachypus) and Japanese pipistrelle (Pipistrellus abramus), respectively. Sequencing of their RNA polymerase (RdRp), spike (S), and nucleocapsid (N) genes revealed that MERS-CoV is more closely related to Pi-BatCoV HKU5 in RdRp (92.1% to 92.3% amino acid [aa] identity) but is more closely related to Ty-BatCoV HKU4 in S (66.8% to 67.4% aa identity) and N (71.9% to 72.3% aa identity). Although both viruses were under purifying selection, the S of Pi-BatCoV HKU5 displayed marked sequence polymorphisms and more positively selected sites than that of Ty-BatCoV HKU4, suggesting that Pi-BatCoV HKU5 may generate variants to occupy new ecological niches along with its host in diverse habitats. Molecular clock analysis showed that they diverged from a common ancestor with MERS-CoV at least several centuries ago. Although MERS-CoV may have diverged from potential lineage C betacoronaviruses in European bats more recently, these bat viruses were unlikely to be the direct ancestor of MERS-CoV. Intensive surveillance for lineage C betaCoVs in Pipistrellus and related bats with diverse habitats and other animals in the Middle East may fill the evolutionary gap.","Lau, Susanna K P; Li, Kenneth S M; Tsang, Alan K L; Lam, Carol S F; Ahmed, Shakeel; Chen, Honglin; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Woo, Patrick C Y; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01055-13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23720729/,495

We report here our experience and long-term outcome of such patients. METHODS Subjects intubated for management of ARDS from Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus pneumonia and ARDS during the April-May 2014 outbreak were included. Their characteristics, ICU course, management, and outcome were evaluated. RESULTS Fourteen subjects, including 3 health-care workers, met study criteria. Besides 2 health-care workers, all subjects had comorbidities. Predominant symptoms were fever, cough, and dyspnea. The worst median PaO2 /FIO2 ratio of 118 post-intubation was seen on the third day, and median APACHE II score was 27. All subjects received lung-protective ventilation and 1 mg/kg/d methylprednisolone infusion for ARDS. Eleven subjects received ribavirin and peginterferon α-2a. Subjects had a critical ICU course and required neuromuscular blockade (n = 11; 79%), required rescue therapy for respiratory failure (n = 8; 57%), developed shock (n = 10; 71%), and required renal replacement therapy (n = 8; 57%). Declining C-reactive protein levels correlated with clinical improvement despite continued positive real-time polymerase chain reaction results. Nine subjects died in ICU. Five subjects, including 3 health-care workers, were discharged from hospital and were alive after 1 y. CONCLUSIONS Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus pneumonia with ARDS has high mortality in subjects with comorbidities. The mainstay of treatment is meticulous ARDS management. Those who survived the acute infection and its complications remained well after 1 y in our study. The role of ribavirin and interferon warrants urgent further evaluation.","Khalid, Imran; Alraddadi, Basem M; Dairi, Youssef; Khalid, Tabindeh J; Kadri, Mazen; Alshukairi, Abeer N; Qushmaq, Ismael A",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.04325; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26701365/,495

The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of commonly used antimicrobial agents in decontamination of multispecies mature oral biofilm on sandblasted, large-grit, acid-etched (SLA) titanium implants. METHODS SLA titanium disks were inoculated with dental plaque and cultured anaerobically for 21 days. The disks were rinsed with 0.9% NaCl, exposed for 2 min. to tetracycline paste, 1% Chlorhexidine gel (CHX), 35% phosphoric acid gel (Etch) or a novel chemical formula (0.3% cetrimide, 0.1% CHX and 0.5% EDTA) and then rinsed again with 0.9% NaCl. Bacteria were quantified from scanning electron micrographs of the implant surfaces. Living bacteria were quantified with confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS Rinsing the surfaces with 0.9% NaCl removed the majority of the biofilm. However, bacteria persisted in all specimens and none of the disinfectants was superior to the double saline rinse group. CLSM analysis showed that CHX and Etch groups had a statistically significant reduction of viable bacteria, although small. Overall the results show that many disinfection agents used in the clinic are ineffective in biofilm removal and leave live bacteria on the surface.","Dostie, Sebastien; Alkadi, Lubna T; Owen, Gethin; Bi, Jiarui; Shen, Ya; Haapasalo, Markus; Larjava, Hannu S",Journal of clinical periodontology,https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpe.12699; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28117914/,495

Understanding the physiological responses of Pyrrhulina aff. brevis to the climatic scenarios proposed by the IPCC (2014) for the next 100 years is of fundamental importance to determine its susceptibility. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate the effects of the predicted climatic scenarios for the year 2100 on the metabolic adjustments of P. aff. brevis . Specifically, the rate of oxygen uptake, electron transport system capacity, glycogen and lactate content and the role of Na+K+-ATPases and H+-ATPase were evaluated. P. aff. brevis individuals were exposed for 15 days to the simulated climatic scenarios in climate scenario rooms, where temperature and CO2 in the air were controlled. Two rooms were used to simulate the climatic scenarios predicted by the IPCC (2014): moderate (RCP 6; 2.5 °C and 400 μatm CO2 above current levels) and extreme (RCP 8.5; 4.5 °C and 900 μatm CO2 above current levels), in addition to the ""control room"" that represents the current scenario. There was an increase in the metabolic rate (MO2) in the animals acclimated to the climate change scenarios (RCP 6 and RCP 8.5) compared to the current scenario. These responses showed a typical effect of temperature on energy demand in relation to the increase in temperature and CO2. Our data showed an increase in O2 consumption (MO2), lactate levels and H+-ATPase activity of the animals acclimated to the moderate and extreme climate change scenarios. Such adjustments presented a clear metabolic imbalance, an alteration that may imply challenges for survival, growth, distribution and reproduction in the face of the expected environmental changes for the year 2100.","Almeida-Silva, J; Campos, D F; Almeida-Val, V M F",Journal of thermal biology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102657; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32888561/,495
99307,Simultaneous Inhibition of Peripheral CB1R and iNOS Mitigates Obesity-Related Dyslipidemia Through Distinct Mechanisms.,2020-07-17,"The aim of this work was to determine a minimal tumor perfusion and receptor density for 177Lu-DOTATATE therapy using physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling considering 1) a desired tumor control probability (TCP) of 99% and 2) a maximal tolerated biologically effective dose (BEDmax) for organs at risk (OARs) in the treatment of neuroendocrine tumors and meningioma. Methods: A recently developed PBPK model was employed. Nine virtual patients (i.e. individualized PBPK models) were used to perform simulations of pharmacokinetics for different combinations of perfusion (0.001-0.1 mL/g/min) and receptor density (1-100 nmol/L). The TCP for each combination was determined for three different treatment strategies: 1) for a standard treatment (4 cycles of 7.4 GBq and 105 nmol), 2) maximizing the number of cycles based on BEDmax for red marrow and kidneys and 3) for 4 cycles with optimized ligand amount and activity. The red marrow and the kidneys (BEDmax of 2 Gy15 and 40 Gy2.5, respectively) were assumed to be OARs. Additionally, the influence of varying glomerular filtration rates, kidney somatostatin receptor densities, tumor volumes and release rates was investigated. Results: To achieve a TCP ≥99% in the standard treatment, a minimal tumor perfusion of 0.036±0.023 mL/g/min and receptor density of 34±20 nmol/L were determined for the nine virtual patients. With the optimization of the number of cycles, the minimum values of perfusion and receptor density were considerably lower with 0.022±0.012 mL/g/min and 21±11 nmol/L, respectively. However, even better results (perfusion = 0.018±0.009 mL/g/min and receptor density = 18±10 nmol/L) were obtained for strategy 3. The release rate of 177Lu (or labelled metabolites) from the cells had the strongest effect on the minimal perfusion and receptor density for standard and optimized treatments. Conclusion: PBPK modeling and simulations represent an elegant approach to individually determine the minimal tumor perfusion and minimal receptor density required to achieve an adequate TCP. This computational method can be employed in the radiopharmaceutical development process for ligand and target selection for specific types of tumors. In addition, this method could be used to optimize clinical trials.","Jiménez-Franco, Luis David; Glatting, Gerhard; Prasad, Vikas; Weber, Wolfgang Andreas; Beer, Ambros J; Kletting, Peter","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",https://doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.120.245068; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32646878/,495
99470,Responding to COVID-19: Agile Use of Information Technology to Serve Patients With Diabetes.,2020-06-01,"Bone-seeking radionuclides, such as Sr-89, Sm-153, and Re-186, have been shown to have an effect on pain from bone metastasis in prostate cancer. The effect on bone pain in other cancer types, including breast cancer, remains unclear. The purpose of the study was to perform a systematic review of the use of radioisotopes for pain relief in metastatic breast cancer. A literature search was performed in PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science (1970 to September 2009) for clinical studies with a primary outcome of pain, performance status, or quality of life. Eligibility criteria were the following: (1) the trial must include at least 10 breast cancer patients with painful bone metastasis, (2) the radionuclide has been approved by regulatory authorities in Europe or the United States and is commercially available (Sr-89, Sm-153, and Re-186), (3) the dose of radionuclides must be clinically effective, (4) the primary endpoint must be pain, performance status or quality of life, and (5) separate reporting of efficacy should be available for breast cancer patients provided the trial included patients with various types of cancer. The literature search identified 189 individual studies of which 19 trials fulfilled the eligibility criteria. There were three randomized controlled trials of which two trials compared two different radionuclides, and one trial compared two doses of Sm-153. In addition, there were 16 uncontrolled trials. Reporting of trial research methodology in the randomized as well as the uncontrolled trials was low (median Jadad score of 1, range 1-2). Key trial details, such as patient recruitment, description of prior palliative therapies, baseline characteristics, follow up, and reporting of outcome was insufficient in a large proportion of the trials. According to Center of Evidence-based Medicine criteria, there is level 4 documentation for the effect of radionuclides in painful bone metastasis in breast cancer. It has been concluded that there is limited clinical evidence supporting the clinical effect of radionuclides in relieving pain from bone metastasis in breast cancer. Large, randomized controlled trials are needed to establish the utility of bone-seeking radionuclides in the palliative care of breast cancer patients.","Christensen, Mette H; Petersen, Lars J",Cancer treatment reviews,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ctrv.2011.05.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21683530/,495

With STIs among male youth on the rise, behavioral interventions that target risky sex among male youth are needed. PURPOSE A randomized controlled pilot study was conducted to examine the feasibility and acceptability of two manualized behavioral interventions for sexually active male youth. METHODS Sexually active at-risk male youth (N = 27) were recruited and randomized to receive one session of motivational interviewing (MI) or didactic educational counseling (DEC). Assessment interviews were conducted prior to and 3 months following the intervention session. RESULTS Support for the feasibility and acceptability of delivering behavioral interventions to reduce risky sexual behaviors among at-risk male youth was found. Compared to participants in DEC at follow-up, participants in MI reported having significantly fewer sexual encounters with casual partners, used substances at the time of sex significantly less often with all partners and casual partners, and reported fewer incidents of using substances at the time of sex without a condom with all partners. Conversely, participants who received MI used substances at the time of sex with main partners and used substances at the time of sex without a condom more often with main partners at follow-up compared to participants who received DEC.

The purpose of this study was to assess whether the stress related to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic affected disease activity in patients with Crohn's disease. BASIC METHODS An anonymous survey was distributed to patients through gastroenterology clinics and networks. Patients were asked to report their Crohn's disease symptoms in the months prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and again during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic using the Manitoba inflammatory bowel disease index in addition to questions about stress, perception of reasons for symptom change and personal impact. MAIN RESULTS Out of 243 individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of Crohn's disease, there was a 24% relative increase in active symptoms between the pre-COVID-19 period to the during-COVID-19 period (P < 0.0001) reflecting an absolute change from 45 to 56%, respectively. The most frequent reported reason for a change in symptoms was 'Increased stress/and or feeling overwhelmed' (118/236), and personal impact of the pandemic was, 'I'm worrying a lot about the future' (113/236), both reported by approximately half of respondents. PRINCIPAL CONCLUSIONS This study serves as a 'proof of concept' demonstrating the impact of a significant and uniquely uniform stressor as a natural experiment on Crohn's disease activity. The severity of symptoms of Crohn's disease increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary reported reason for symptom change was an increase in stress, not a change in diet, exercise or other lifestyle behaviours, corroborating the hypothesis that stress affects Crohn's disease activity.","Goodday, Sarah M; Travis, Simon; Walsh, Alissa; Friend, Stephen H",European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology,https://doi.org/10.1097/meg.0000000000002081; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33512845/,495

What has occurred in this year and a half goes beyond anything we have dealt with, as humankind, in the past two centuries, perhaps obscured only by war. An incredible number of articles, whether scientific or in the press, have been published, making it impossible to discern between what is biological and what is social in nature. Here, we aim to reflect on the basic structure of the virus and associate its behavior to that of determining factors of the human condition that may be modifiable soon.

Many objective measures of gland distortion were previously proposed allowing for user-independent classification of acquired gland images. However, due to the complicated nature of gland deformation, none of the single-valued parameters can fully describe the analyzed gland images. There is a need to increase the number of descriptive factors, selectively sensitive to different gland features. Here we show that global 2D Fourier transform analysis of infra-red gland images provides values of two new such parameters: mean gland frequency and anisotropy in gland periodicity. We show that their values correlate with gland dysfunction and can be used to automatically categorize the images into the three subjective classes (healthy, intermediate and unhealthy). We also demonstrated that classification performance can be improved by dimensionality reduction approach using principal component analysis.","Ciężar, K; Pochylski, M",The ocular surface,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtos.2020.09.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32916252/,495

Methods Our pilot, observational study included 15 patients (30 eyes) with severe POAG. Visual acuity, intraocular pressure, number of anti-glaucoma drugs, visual fields, and SPARCS score were recorded at first visit and at 12 and 24 months. Results We observed changes in mean deviation (MD) from -19.37 ± 5.04 to -20.63 ± 4.07, mean pattern standard deviation (PSD) from 11.49 ± 2.61 to 11.35 ± 2.01, and mean SPARCS score from 54.97 ± 15.66 to 53.50 ± 16.42. We found no statistically significant difference between visual field parameters and SPARCS scores associated with the number or type of prescribed anti-glaucoma drugs. Spearman's correlation coefficient of SPARCS at baseline (SPARCS1) versus MD at baseline (MD1) was 0.274 (p = 0.142) and SPARCS1 versus PSD at baseline (PSD1) was -0.163 (p = 0.389). The correlation coefficient between SPARCS at 12 months (SPARCS2) versus MD (MD2) at the same time point was computed to be 0.391 (p = 0.03), whereas SPARCS2 versus PSD at 12 months was -0.212 (p = 0.262). Similarly, we found the coefficient to be 0.336 (p = 0.069) for SPARCS3 (SPARCS at 24 months) versus MD3 (MD at 24 months) and -0.242 (p = 0.197) for SPARCS3 versus PSD3 (PSD at 24 months). Correlation coefficients between SPARCS1/2, SPARCS1/3, MD1/2, MD1/3 PSD1/2, and PSD1/3 were 0.856, 0.865, 0.748, 0.722, 0.497, and 0.562, respectively (p < 0.001).

Follistatin neutralizes the TGFβ ligands, myostatin and activin A, by forming a nearly irreversible non-signaling complex by surrounding the ligand and preventing interaction with TGFβ receptors. The FS288-ligand complex has higher affinity than unbound FS288 for heparin/HS, which accelerates ligand internalization and lysosomal degradation; however, limited information is available for how FS288 interactions with heparin affect ligand binding. Using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) we show that preincubation of FS288 with heparin/HS significantly decreased the association kinetics for both myostatin and activin A with seemingly no effect on the dissociation rate. This observation is dependent on the heparin/HS chain length where small chain lengths less than degree of polymerization 10 (dp10) did not alter association rates but chain lengths >dp10 decreased association rates. In an attempt to understand the mechanism for this observation, we uncovered that heparin induced dimerization of follistatin. Consistent with our SPR results, we found that dimerization only occurs with heparin molecules >dp10. Small-angle X-ray scattering of the FS288 heparin complex supports that FS288 adopts a dimeric configuration that is similar to the FS288 dimer in the ligand-bound state. These results indicate that heparin mediates dimerization of FS288 in a chain-length-dependent manner that reduces the ligand association rate, but not the dissociation rate or antagonistic activity of FS288.","Walker, Ryan G; Kattamuri, Chandramohan; Goebel, Erich J; Zhang, Fuming; Hammel, Michal; Tainer, John A; Linhardt, Robert J; Thompson, Thomas B",Experimental biology and medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/1535370220966296; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33197333/,495
101330,Factors that influence the implementation of health and social care Standards: a systematic review and meta-summary protocol.,2021,"BACKGROUND COVID-19 is rapidly transmitted and has aroused enormous concern globally. This study aimed to investigate the effect of hydrocolloid dressing combined with 3M Cavilon No-Sting Barrier Film on the prevention of facial pressure injury in medical staff tasked with preventing and controlling COVID-19. METHODS This was a self-controlled study. Medical staff who treated patients with COVID-19 infection in isolation wards from 6 January to 2 February, 2020, were selected to participate. Phase I was defined as the first 2 weeks of medical personnel entering the isolation ward, with phase II being the following 2 weeks. In phase I, medical workers only used hydrocolloid dressing on their faces, and in phase II, they used both hydrocolloid dressing and 3M Cavilon No-Sting Barrier Film. RESULTS A total of 116 medical workers were selected as research subjects. The average facial local temperature in phase I was higher than that in phase II from the baseline (day 1) to the end of the study (day 14); however, there was no statistically significant difference (P>0.05). The incidence of facial pressure injury in phase II was lower than that in phase I (P<0.05); the facial skin comfort level among medical staff in phase II was higher than that in phase I (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS Hydrocolloid dressing combined with 3M Cavilon No-Sting Barrier Film for facial skin care can effectively reduce the incidence of facial pressure injury and can improve skin comfort level while ensuring isolation and a protective effect.","Zhang, Shuanghong; Hu, Shidong; Chen, Hezhen; Jia, Xiaohui",Annals of palliative medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/apm-20-1615; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33474960/,495

Russelioside B is a steroidal glycoside isolated from several Caralluma species. No study tested the ulcer healing potential of the compound. The current study aimed to assess the protective effect of russelioside B against ethanol-induced gastric mucosal injury in rats. Ulcer was induced on rats by a single intragastric dose of absolute ethanol (5 mL/kg). Rats were randomly assorted into four groups (n=8) and given treatments (Antodine, 20 mg/kg or russelioside B, 50 mg/kg) by oral gavage 1 h before ulcer induction. Pretreatment with russelioside B (50 mg/kg) attenuated the gastric mucosal injury as proved by a decrease of ulcer index, and histological scores. It suppressed the gastric inflammation by a significant lowering the tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6 levels with myeloperoxidase activity (which are also aggravating factors in the case of Covid-19 infection). In addition, administration of russelioside B halted the gastric oxidative stress via inhibition of lipid peroxides by maintaining reduced glutathione and by decreasing malondialdehyde. It was able also to restore the sharp drop in the levels of heat shock protein-70, vascular endothelial growth factor and prostaglandin E2 induced by ethanol. Additionally, it showed carbonic anhydrase inhibition activity. The gastroprotective action of russelioside B was umpired through multi mechanistic actions; suppression of gastric oxidative stress, inflammation, anti-apoptotic activities and enhanced gastric mucosal protection by up-regulation of endothelial growth factor, normalization of heat shock protein-70 and prostaglandin E2. These actions were comparable in part to some classical antiulcer drugs such as famotidine.","El-Shiekh, Riham A; Salama, Abeer; Al-Mokaddem, Asmaa K; Bader, Ammar; Abdel-Sattar, Essam A",Steroids,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.steroids.2020.108759; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33181144/,495

102638,Why Do People With Diabetes Have a High Risk for Severe COVID-19 Disease?-A Dental Hypothesis and Possible Prevention Strategy.,2020-06-07,"BACKGROUND A highly positive intraoperative fluid balance should be prevented as it negatively impacts patient outcome. Analysis of volume-kinetics has identified an increase in interstitial fluid volume after crystalloid fluid loading during isoflurane anesthesia. Isoflurane has also been associated with postoperative hypoxemia and may be associated with an increase in alveolar epithelial permeability, edema formation, and hindered oxygen exchange. In this article, the authors compare fluid extravasation rates before and during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) with isoflurane- versus propofol-based anesthesia. METHODS Fourteen pigs underwent 2 h of tepid CPB with propofol (P-group; n = 7) or isoflurane anesthesia (I-group; n = 7). Fluid requirements, plasma volume, colloid osmotic pressures in plasma and interstitial fluid, hematocrit levels, and total tissue water content were recorded, and fluid extravasation rates calculated. RESULTS Fluid extravasation rates increased in the I-group from the pre-CPB level of 0.27 (0.13) to 0.92 (0.36) ml·kg·min, but remained essentially unchanged in the P-group with significant between-group differences during CPB (pb = 0.002). The results are supported by corresponding changes in interstitial colloid osmotic pressure and total tissue water content. CONCLUSIONS During CPB, isoflurane, in contrast to propofol, significantly contributes to a general increase in fluid shifts from the intravascular to the interstitial space with edema formation and a possible negative impact on postoperative organ function.","Brekke, Hege Kristin; Hammersborg, Stig Morten; Lundemoen, Steinar; Mongstad, Arve; Kvalheim, Venny Lise; Haugen, Oddbjørn; Husby, Paul",Anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aln.0b013e31829ab018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23719612/,495
102968,"Physical therapy interventions for older people with vertigo, dizziness and balance disorders addressing mobility and participation: a systematic review.",2020-11-23,"BACKGROUND COVID-19 pandemic has affected worldwide sports competitions and training in both amateur and professional leagues. We thus aimed to investigate changes in different training modalities in elite and amateur football players following COVID-19 lockdown in March 2020. METHODS In this cross-sectional study we applied a Likert scale-based questionnaire with 20 items to quantify and classify time spent at standard training methods in 47 professional and 54 amateur football players from 12 Austrian clubs before and during lockdown. Additionally, McLean score was calculated to assess perceived training fatigue. RESULTS Weekly amount of training time at endurance exercises (cycling) increased in both professional (37.5 [IQR 46.5] min/week vs. 187.5 [IQR 127.5] min/week, p<0.001), and amateur players (0.0 [IQR 45.0] min/week vs. 37.5 [IQR 112.5] min/week, p=0.015) during COVID-19 lockdown. Time on diverse muscle strengthening workouts was significantly elevated in both cohorts. Total training time at ball declined for professionals (from 472.5 [IQR 150] min/week to 15.0 [IQR 112.5] min/week, p<0.001) and amateurs (from 337.5 [IQR 285] min/week to 0.0 [IQR 37.5] min/week, p<0.001). Videoguided training was intensified in both groups (p<0.001 each). Location shifted from football fields and gyms to home and outdoors. Overall McLean score remained unchanged in amateurs (p=0.42) while elite players showed a trend towards an increase (p=0.056). CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 lockdown compromised football training, especially training concepts with ball. Consequently, resulting changes in exercise loads and muscular burden might impact susceptibility for injuries and impair performances especially in amateur players, especially as they lacked training supervision and professional training plans. Minimum effective dose of training workload in order to maintain endurance- and neuromuscular-related performance parameters should be prescribed.","Schüttler, Dominik; Hamm, Wolfgang; Krammer, Simone; Steffen, Julius; Deuster, Eileen; Lauseker, Michael; Egger, Florian; Meyer, Tim; Brunner, Stefan",The Journal of sports medicine and physical fitness,https://doi.org/10.23736/s0022-4707.21.12256-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33871243/,495

As populations age, the global burden of AF is expected to rise. AF is associated with stroke and thromboembolic complications, which contribute to significant morbidity and mortality. As a result, it remains paramount to identify patients at elevated risk of thromboembolism and to determine who will benefit from thromboembolic prophylaxis. Conventional practice advocates the use of clinical risk scoring criteria to identify patients at risk of thromboembolic complications. These risk scores have modest discriminatory ability in many sub-populations of patients with AF, highlighting the need for improved risk stratification tools. New insights have been gained on the utility of biomarkers and imaging modalities, and there is emerging data on the importance of the identification and treatment of subclinical AF. Finally, the advent of wearable devices to detect cardiac arrhythmias pose a new and evolving challenge in the practice of cardiology. This review aims to address strategies to enhance thromboembolic risk stratification and identify challenges with current and future practice.","Wan, Darryl; Andrade, Jason; Laksman, Zachary",Reviews in cardiovascular medicine,https://doi.org/10.31083/j.rcm2202042; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34258903/,495

To explore vaccine acceptance decisions, we conducted a national survey of 1,000 people from all US states in August of 2020 and a replication in December of 2020. Using a 3 × 3 × 3 factorial experimental design, we estimated the impact of three factors: probability of 1) protection against COVID-19, 2) minor side effects, and 3) a serious adverse reactions. The outcome was respondents' reported likelihood of receiving a vaccine for the coronavirus. Probability of vaccine efficacy (50%, 70%, or 90%) had the largest effect among the three factors. The probability of minor side effects (50%, 75%, 90%) including fever and sore arm, did not significantly influence likelihood of receiving the vaccine. The chances of a serious adverse reaction, such as temporary or permanent paralysis, had a small but significant effect. A serious adverse reaction rate of 1/100,000 was more likely to discourage vaccine use in comparison to rates of 1/million or 1/100 million. All interactions between the factors were nonsignificant. A replication following the announcement that vaccines were 95% effective showed small, but significant increases in the likelihood of taking a vaccine. The main effects and interactions in the model remained unchanged. Expected benefit was more influential in respondents' decision making than expected side effects. The absence of interaction effects suggests that respondents consider the side effects and benefits independently.","Kaplan, Robert M; Milstein, Arnold",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2021726118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33619178/,495

Travel bans-herein defined as the complete restriction of travel from at least one geographic region to at least one other international geographic region-are a potential policy solution to control the global spread of disease. The social, economic, and health-related consequences of travel bans, as well as the available evidence on the effectiveness of travel restrictions in preventing the global spread of influenza, have been previously described. However, the effectiveness of travel bans in reducing the spread of noninfluenza EIDs, characterized by different rates and modes of transmission, is less well understood. This study employs an integrative review approach to summarize the minimal evidence on effectiveness of travel bans to decrease the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS), Ebola virus disease (EVD), and Zika virus disease (ZVD). We describe and qualify the evidence presented in six modeling studies that assess the effectiveness of travel bans in controlling these noninfluenza EID events. We conclude that there is an urgent need for additional research to inform policy decisions on the use of travel bans and other control measures to control noninfluenza EIDs in advance of the next outbreak.","Errett, Nicole A; Sauer, Lauren M; Rutkow, Lainie",Journal of emergency management,https://doi.org/10.5055/jem.2020.0446; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32031668/,495

As such, continuous antibiotic prophylaxis (CAP) is empirically recommended until age of toilet training; however, there are limited data to support this. The objective of this systematic review was to summarize the existing data and compare UTI rates in infants with asymptomatic VUR on CAP during the first year of life, to those not on CAP. Secondary objectives were to determine associated risk factors with UTI development. METHODS A systematic search of all relevant studies and abstracts was conducted using 4 electronic databases by utilizing appropriate key words by an expert hospital librarian. Eligible studies included children with prenatal hydronephrosis, asymptomatic VUR with or without CAP, and reported on development of UTI in the first year. RESULTS Of 6903 citations screened, 18 were selected, giving a total population of 829 (69.4% male, median age 57 days) who met the inclusion criteria. Most studies were retrospective and of low-quality evidence. Overall, 15.4% of patients developed at least one breakthrough UTI and females had a higher risk of UTI (odds ratio (OR) 2.3, 95% CI 1.1-4.7). Comparison with children not taking CAP was not readily reported, and meta-analysis could not be completed.

Yet surprisingly little is known about how this diagnostic skill is learned or how it should be taught. Some authors have pointed to a dual-process model, suggesting that assessments of illness severity are driven by two distinct types of processing: an intuitive, fast, pattern recognition-like process (Type 1) that depends on many prior patient encounters and outcomes being stored in memory; and a deliberate, slow, analytic process (Type 2) characterized by additional data gathering, data scrutiny, or recollection of rules. But prior studies have supported a dual-process model for the assessment of illness severity only insofar as experienced clinicians chiefly displayed what was presumed to be Type 1 processing. Here we further explored a dual-process model by examining whether less experienced clinicians displayed both types of processing when assessing illness severity across a series of cases. Consistent with the model, a dissociation between Type 1 and Type 2 processing was observed through resident reports of deliberation, response times, and three eye tracking metrics associated with diagnostic expertise. We conclude by discussing potential implications for the training of this enigmatic diagnostic skill.","LoGiudice, Andrew B; Sherbino, Jonathan; Norman, Geoffrey; Monteiro, Sandra; Sibbald, Matthew",Advances in health sciences education : theory and practice,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10459-020-10023-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423154/,495

AIM To asses efficacy of ablation for PAF in a middle-volume EP center over last years. METHODS Retrospective analysis of 1 year efficacy and safety of ablation for PAF in three cohorts of patients treated between 2011 and 2014 (period I), 2015-2017 (period II), and 2018-2019 (period III). RESULTS Of 234 patients (mean age 57 ± 9 years, 165 males), 81 (35%) were treated in period I, 84 (36%) in period II, and 69 (29%) in period III. The overall efficacy of ablation during all analyzed periods was 67%. The overall efficacy of ablation increased over time-from 56% in period I to 68% in period II and 81% in period III. Significant improvement was achieved using radiofrequency ablation (RF) (53% in period I vs 82% in period III, and 55% in period II vs 82% in period III, p = 0.003 and 0.0012, respectively) whereas positive trend in the improvement of cryoballoon efficacy was NS. The rate of peri-procedural complications was 9% and it did not change significantly over time. CONCLUSIONS This real-life observational study from a medium volume EP center shows that progress in PAF ablation, especially RF, reported by highly-skilled centers, can be reproduced in real life by less experienced operators.","Kulakowski, Piotr; Sikorska, Agnieszka; Piotrowski, Roman; Kryński, Tomasz; Baran, Jakub",Journal of interventional cardiac electrophysiology : an international journal of arrhythmias and pacing,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10840-020-00937-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423186/,495
109325,Impact of frailty metabolic phenotypes on the management of older people with type 2 diabetes mellitus.,2021-06-20,"Obesity is associated with an increase prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms and diseases, such as depression. Based on the facts that pro-inflammatory cytokines are able to modulate behavior, and that obesity is characterized by a chronic low-grade inflammatory state, inflammation has been hypothesized to contribute to the neuropsychiatric comorbidity in obese individuals. However, a causal link between inflammation and the development of neuropsychiatric symptoms is hard to establish in humans. Here, we used an inflammatory stimulus, i.e. the intravenous injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), in a double-blind placebo-controlled design to determine the vulnerability of obese individuals to inflammation-induced behavioral changes. The hypothesis was that obese individuals would show heightened behavioral response compared to normal-weight subjects for the same inflammatory stimulus, reflecting an increased sensitivity to the behavioral effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines. LPS (dose 0.8 ng/kg body weight, adjusted for blood volume in obese subjects) and placebo (saline) were intravenously injected in 14 obese healthy subjects and 23 normal-weight healthy subjects in a within-subject, randomized, crossover design. LPS administration induced, in both groups, an acute increase in blood concentrations of cytokines (interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α and IL-10), as well as in body temperature, cortisol, norepinephrine, sickness symptoms, fatigue, negative mood and state anxiety. There were little differences in the immune and behavioral responses to LPS between obese and normal-weight subjects, but the cortisol response to LPS was strongly attenuated in obese individuals. Higher percentage of body fat was related to a lower cortisol response to LPS. Taken together, the population of young and healthy obese individuals in this study did not exhibit an increased behavioral sensitivity to cytokines, but an attenuated cortisol response to the immune challenge.

Geriatric patients face more challenges with video visit access compared to younger patients due to discomfort with technology and less access to devices and internet. Medical students at the University of Michigan created an initiative to improve access to and comfort with video visits for geriatric patients. The program's goals were to (a) explore options for the delivery of personalized training to older adults, (b) create materials for volunteers to successfully navigate conversations with patients and caregivers, (c) provide patients one-to-one remote guidance while identifying and overcoming barriers-with practice sessions to increase comfort, (d) share with the larger health system, and (e) ensure program sustainability. Over a 10-week evaluation period, providers whose patients worked with our geriatric education on telehealth access volunteers had a video visit rate of 43% compared to 19.2% prior to participation in the program (adjusted odds ratio = 3.38, 95% confidence interval = 2.49, 4.59), ultimately providing a platform for geriatric patients to foster stronger connections with their providers, while increasing Michigan Medicine's overall proportion of video telehealth visits.","Pichan, Cayla M; Anderson, Clare E; Min, Lillian C; Blazek, Mary C",Journal of telemedicine and telecare,https://doi.org/10.1177/1357633x211023924; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34152885/,495

109850,[Human Resources for Intensive Care Medicine in Portugal in the Post-COVID Era].,2020-07-23,"OBJECTIVE To assess the long-term impact of early COVID-19 lockdown phase on emergency psychiatric consultations in two psychiatric emergency departments located in Italy. METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional study comparing the number and characteristics of emergency psychiatric consultations during post-lockdown with respect to the lockdown period. Sociodemographic data, clinical characteristics, referred symptoms, diagnosis, information on multiple psychiatric consultations and hospitalisation were collected. RESULTS A rise of almost 60% in emergency psychiatric consultations during the post-lockdown compared to the lockdown period was observed. Emergency psychiatric consultations in the post-lockdown period were associated with lower rates of cannabis (aOR = 0.42, p = 0.011) and cocaine use (aOR = 0.39, p = 0.011). Despite a lower occurrence of two or more psychiatric consultations was observed during post-lockdown phase (aOR = 0.44, p = 0.008), subjects who had anxiety disorders (aOR = 3.91, p = 0.000) and substance intoxication or withdrawal (aOR = 6.89, p = 0.000) were more likely to present to emergency psychiatric consultations during post-lockdown period compared to the lockdown one. CONCLUSIONS Substance intoxication or withdrawal and anxiety disorders increased after the COVID-19 lockdown. The findings of this study suggest to address more economic and professional sources to the mental health areas potentially more affected by the different phases of a pandemic.KEYPOINTSCOVID-19 pandemic and lockdown measures increased mental health unmet needs.According to our findings, a rise in emergency psychiatric consultations during the post-lockdown compared to the lockdown period was observed.Patients with substance intoxication or withdrawal syndrome and anxiety disorders were significantly more likely to present to emergency psychiatric consultations during post-lockdown.Lockdown was associated with higher rates of both cannabis and cocaine use disorders as well as of multiple psychiatric consultations.Alternative strategies to improve mental health such as e-health technologies should be promoted.","Capuzzi, Enrico; Caldiroli, Alice; Di Brita, Carmen; Colmegna, Fabrizia; Nava, Roberto; Colzani, Lia Chiara; Sibilla, Matteo; Prodi, Tiziano; Buoli, Massimiliano; Clerici, Massimo",International journal of psychiatry in clinical practice,https://doi.org/10.1080/13651501.2021.1939385; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34151680/,495

Here, we obtained data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study between 1990 and 2019, to model how pancreatic cancer will affect the 27 countries of the European Union (EU) plus the United Kingdom (the pre-Brexit EU-28) until 2039 by conducting the Bayesian age-period-cohort analysis. The number of new pancreatic cancer cases in the EU-28 was 59,000 in 1990, 109,000 in 2019, and projected to be 147,000 in 2039. This corresponded to 60,000, 109,000, and 155,000 for deaths, and a loss of 1.3 million, 2.0 million, and 2.7 million for disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), respectively. The most pronounced increase of the crude incidence rate was observed and projected to be in the population older than 80 years. The age-standardized rate (ASR) of incidence, however, increased from 8.6 to 10.1 per 100,000 person-years during 1990-2019 but was projected to remain stable during 2019-2039. At the same time, our models only predicted a mild increase for the ASR of mortality until 2039. The fraction of pancreatic cancer mortality attributable to tobacco consumption decreased during 1990-2019, but we found upward trends for the attributable fractions for high fasting plasma glucose and high body-mass index. In conclusion, a substantial increase in counts of incidence, mortality, and DALYs lost of pancreatic cancer in the EU-28 is projected over the next two decades, which indicates the need for future health policies and interventions.

Recent guidelines from the AUA/CUA/SUFU and advancements in the field reflect a paradigm shift for clinician and patients, steering away from empiric antibiotic therapy towards judicious antibiotic use. RECENT FINDINGS Antibiotic stewardship, including increasing awareness of the collateral damage of antibiotics and the risks of bacterial resistance are a major focus of the new guidelines. Accurate diagnosis of rUTIs is imperative. Urine cultures are necessary to document rUTI and should be obtained prior to any treatment. First line treatment options (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, nitrofurantoin, and fosfomycin) should be used whenever possible. Asymptomatic bacteriuria should not be treated in these patients with rUTI. Although antibiotic prophylaxis methods are effective, nonantibiotic regimens show promise. SUMMARY The management of rUTIs has evolved significantly with the goals of antibiotic stewardship. It is increasingly important to ensure the accuracy of diagnosis with a positive urine culture in the setting of cystitis symptoms, and standardize treatment with first-line therapies to minimize antibiotic side effects.","Taich, Lior; Zhao, Hanson; Cordero, Camila; Anger, Jennifer T",Current opinion in urology,https://doi.org/10.1097/mou.0000000000000823; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32941258/,495

General confinement measures imposed by governments have had a strong impact on cultural practices, including within dance schools. This article describes the actions implemented by the Dance Department of the Lyon National Conservatory of Music and Dance (CNSMDL, France) in order to ensure pedagogical continuity during the confinement period. The study focused on the 12 preparatory-year students in contemporary dance. Despite numerous constraints-primarily small workspaces, unstable Internet connections, and the difficulty of correcting technical dance moves at a distance-all students and teachers were able to maintain pedagogical follow-up through a series of constructed activities. Students appreciated the social aspect (the relationship with their teachers and fellow students) and day-structuring component of the scheduling. The online activities helped to avoid student isolation, and motivation seemed unaffected. While online exercises can never replace ""in the flesh"" dance classes, this crisis provided an opportunity to develop pedagogical innovations and tools that could be reused in face-to-face dance instruction in other contexts such as injuries and intermittent work conditions.","Bruyneel, Anne-Violette; Beauviche, Juliette; Caussé, Benoit; Walters, Kylie",Journal of dance medicine & science : official publication of the International Association for Dance Medicine & Science,https://doi.org/10.12678/1089-313x.24.4.147; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33218367/,495

However, most of the published studies are small case series, and only two randomized trials exist in literature. AIM Aim of this systematic review is to describe trends in VV ECMO treatment outcomes according to large studies only. METHODS We searched and included studies with more than 100 VV ECMO cases dated up to August 1st, 2019. RESULTS Thirty-three studies published in the period 2011-2019 met inclusion criteria, for a total of 12,860 patients (age 46.3 ± 17.4 years). ARDS was mainly by pneumonia, in 3126 (37%) cases; further 401(7%) patients had H1N1 Influenza A infection. Cannulation-related complications occurred in 502 (7%) cases. Weighted mean (95% confidence interval) of VV ECMO duration was 8.9 (8.7-9.1) days, and ICU stay was 23.6 (22.4-24.8) days. Mortality at the longest follow up available was 40%. Data collection in 70% of the studies had a duration of >5 years.

112604,Advance care planning: A systematic review about experiences of patients with a life-threatening or life-limiting illness.,2018,"OBJECTIVE Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has now been declared as a worldwide pandemic. Currently, no drugs have been endorsed for its treatment; in this manner, a pressing need has been developed for any antiviral drugs that will treat COVID-19. Coronaviruses require the SARS-CoV-2 3CL-Protease (3CL-protease) for cleavage of its polyprotein to yield a single useful protein and assume a basic role in the disease progression. In this study, we demonstrated that punicalagin, the fundamental active element of pomegranate in addition to the combination of punicalagin with zinc (Zn) II, appear to show powerful inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2. MATERIALS AND METHODS The 3CL protease assay kit was used to quantify 3CL protease action. The tetrazolium dye, MTS, was used to evaluate cytotoxicity. RESULTS Punicalagin showed inhibitory action against the 3CL-protease in a dose-dependent manner, and IC50 was found to be 6.192 μg/ml for punicalagin. Punicalagin (10 µg/mL) demonstrated a significant inhibitory activity toward 3CL-protease activity (p < 0.001), yet when punicalagin is combined with zinc sulfate monohydrate (punicalagin/Zn-II) extremely strong 3CL-protease activity (p < 0.001) was obtained. The action of 3CL-protease with punicalagin/Zn-II was decreased by approximately 4.4-fold in contrast to only punicalagin (10 µg/mL). Likewise, we did not notice any significant cytotoxicity caused by punicalagin, Zn-II, or punicalagin/Zn-II. CONCLUSIONS We suggest that these compounds could be used as potential antiviral drugs against COVID-19.","Saadh, M J; Almaaytah, A M; Alaraj, M; Dababneh, M F; Sa'adeh, I; Aldalaen, S M; Kharshid, A M; Alboghdadly, A; Hailat, M; Khaleel, A; Al-Hamaideh, K D; Abu Dayyih, W",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202105_25958; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34109605/,495

However, serious and possibly fatal duodenal stump perforation can develop in extremely rare cases. We describe a case of subtotal gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y reconstruction followed by repeated duodenal stump perforations. A 79-year-old man with a long history of diabetes and hypertension was admitted to our institution with epigastralgia and right hypochondralgia. Computed tomography and an upper gastrointestinal imaging series revealed remarkable wall thickening of the gastric antrum and corpus. Upper endoscopy also showed a giant ulcerative lesion in the same area. The lesion was confirmed by histology to be poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. The patient underwent open subtotal gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y reconstruction. However, duodenal stump perforation occurred repeatedly on postoperative days 1, 3, and 19, which caused peritonitis. The patient was kept alive through duodenal stump repair, an additional resection using a stapling device, and repeated drainage treatments; but he suffered considerable morbidity due to these complications. We report a case of a life-threatening duodenal stump perforation after subtotal gastrectomy, highlighting lessons learned from the profile and clinical course. Abdominal surgeons should be aware of the possibility of this serious complication of duodenal stump perforation, and be able to perform immediate interventions, including life-saving reoperation.","Furihata, Tadashi; Furihata, Makoto; Satoh, Naoki; Kosaka, Masato; Ishikawa, Kunibumi; Kubota, Keiichi",International surgery,https://doi.org/10.9738/intsurg-d-14-00266.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25875557/,495

We discuss in detail the transmission dynamics, vaccination strategies and, importantly, the 'shadow pandemic', encompassing underappreciated indirect impacts of the pandemic on children. The indirect effects of COVID-19 will have a long-term impact beyond the immediate pandemic period. These include the mental health and wellbeing risks, disruption to family income and attendant stressors including increased family violence, delayed medical attention and the critical issue of prolonged loss of face-to-face learning in a normal school environment. Amplification of existing inequities and creation of new disadvantage are likely additional sequelae, with children from vulnerable families disproportionately affected.

Due to their ability to readily spread and colonize patients in healthcare environments, preventing the transmission of these organisms is a major public health initiative and coordinated international effort are needed. Central to the treatment and control of carbapenemase-producing organisms (CPOs) are phenotypic (growth-/biochemical-dependent) and nucleic acid-based carbapenemase detection tests that identify carbapenemase activity directly or their associated molecular determinants. Importantly, bacterial isolates harboring carbapenemases are often resistant to multiple antibiotic classes, resulting in limited therapy options. Emerging agents, novel antibiotic combinations and treatment regimens offer promise for management of these infections.

The insidious onset of type 2 diabetes delays diagnosis and increases morbidity2. Given the multifactorial vascular effects of diabetes, we hypothesized that smartphone-based photoplethysmography could provide a widely accessible digital biomarker for diabetes. Here we developed a deep neural network (DNN) to detect prevalent diabetes using smartphone-based photoplethysmography from an initial cohort of 53,870 individuals (the 'primary cohort'), which we then validated in a separate cohort of 7,806 individuals (the 'contemporary cohort') and a cohort of 181 prospectively enrolled individuals from three clinics (the 'clinic cohort'). The DNN achieved an area under the curve for prevalent diabetes of 0.766 in the primary cohort (95% confidence interval: 0.750-0.782; sensitivity 75%, specificity 65%) and 0.740 in the contemporary cohort (95% confidence interval: 0.723-0.758; sensitivity 81%, specificity 54%). When the output of the DNN, called the DNN score, was included in a regression analysis alongside age, gender, race/ethnicity and body mass index, the area under the curve was 0.830 and the DNN score remained independently predictive of diabetes. The performance of the DNN in the clinic cohort was similar to that in other validation datasets. There was a significant and positive association between the continuous DNN score and hemoglobin A1c (P ≤ 0.001) among those with hemoglobin A1c data. These findings demonstrate that smartphone-based photoplethysmography provides a readily attainable, non-invasive digital biomarker of prevalent diabetes.","Avram, Robert; Olgin, Jeffrey E; Kuhar, Peter; Hughes, J Weston; Marcus, Gregory M; Pletcher, Mark J; Aschbacher, Kirstin; Tison, Geoffrey H",Nature medicine,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-020-1010-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32807931/,495
113994,Accelerating climate action: the role of health professionals.,2021-10-06,"Recent work has provided evidence for the occurrence of N-hydroxypipecolic acid (NHP) in Arabidopsis thaliana, characterized its pathogen-inducible biosynthesis by a three-step metabolic sequence from l-lysine, and established a central role for NHP in the regulation of systemic acquired resistance. Here, we show that NHP is biosynthesized in several other plant species in response to microbial attack, generally together with its direct metabolic precursor pipecolic acid and the phenolic immune signal salicylic acid. For example, NHP accumulates locally in inoculated leaves and systemically in distant leaves of cucumber in response to Pseudomonas syringae attack, in Pseudomonas-challenged tobacco and soybean leaves, in tomato inoculated with the oomycete Phytophthora infestans, in leaves of the monocot Brachypodium distachyon infected with bacterial (Xanthomonas translucens) and fungal (Magnaporthe oryzae) pathogens, and in M. oryzae-inoculated barley. Notably, resistance assays indicate that NHP acts as a potent inducer of acquired resistance to bacterial and fungal infection in distinct monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous species. Pronounced systemic accumulation of NHP in leaf phloem sap of locally inoculated cucumber supports a function for NHP as a phloem-mobile immune signal. Our study thus generalizes the existence and function of an NHP resistance pathway in plant systemic acquired resistance.","Schnake, Anika; Hartmann, Michael; Schreiber, Stefan; Malik, Jana; Brahmann, Lisa; Yildiz, Ipek; von Dahlen, Janina; Rose, Laura E; Schaffrath, Ulrich; Zeier, Jürgen",Journal of experimental botany,https://doi.org/10.1093/jxb/eraa317; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32725118/,495

In recent years, concern about the use of HES has been raised because of serious adverse events, including acute kidney injury, bleeding and even increased mortality with its use. In the outlined systematic review, we aim to assess if the adverse effects of HES 130/0.38-0.45 in patients with sepsis could have been discovered earlier. METHODS We will conduct a systematic review with meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials in animals and patients and observational studies in patients comparing HES 130/0.38-0.45 vs any crystalloid in sepsis. The primary outcome will be all-cause mortality at longest follow-up. We will systematically search EMBASE, MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library for relevant literature. We will follow the recommendations by the Cochrane Handbook, the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statements and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. DISCUSSION With the outlined systematic review, we aim to assess whether the adverse effects of HES 130/0.38-0.45 could have been discovered earlier by comparing summary effect estimates of harm from observational studies in patients and randomised trials in animals and patients.

However, clear clinical benefit is yet to be shown in large clinical trials. In this review, the major studies in different types of endovascular treatments including intra-arterial thrombolysis, aspiration devices, mechanical clot retrievers and the new stent retrievers are discussed. First-generation mechanical thrombectomy devices such as the MERCI Retriever (Stryker, Kalamazoo, MI, USA) and Penumbra aspiration device (Penumbra Inc., Alameda, CA, USA) demonstrated safety and higher rates of recanalisation in the MERCI and Penumbra Pivotal Stroke Trial; however, there was no significant improvement in clinical outcome. Second-generation endovascular stent retrieval devices Solitaire (ev3 Neurovascular, Irvine, CA, USA) and Trevo (Stryker) have shown promising results. In preliminary trials, SOLITAIRE with the Intention for Thrombectomy (SWIFT) and Thrombectomy Revascularization of Large Vessel Occlusions (TREVO), both showed rates of recanalisation close to 90% and significantly improved clinical outcomes compared with the MERCI study, but the recent landmark studies for endovascular treatment (Interventional Management of Stroke (IMS III), Mechanical Retrieval and Recanalisation of Stroke Clots Using Embolectomy (MR-RESCUE) and SYNTHESIS) did not show any clinical benefit from endovascular treatment compared with standard intravenous therapy. However, moving forward, the recent Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischaemic Stroke in the Netherlands (MR-CLEAN) study results have shown marked improvements in recanalisation, reperfusion and functional outcome in patients receiving endovascular treatment (97% using stent retrievers) within 6 h in addition to standard medical care. Overall, although evidence regarding the efficacy of endovascular treatment in acute stroke has been equivocal, recent publications of large multicentre randomised controlled trials indicate benefit of intra-arterial stent retriever reperfusion in patients selected by appropriate imaging and treated early by experienced operators, and it will likely remain an important adjunct to established medical treatment with intravenous tPA.","Asadi, H; Dowling, R; Yan, B; Wong, S; Mitchell, P",Internal medicine journal,https://doi.org/10.1111/imj.12652; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25443686/,495

117253,COVID-19: Considerations of Diabetes and Cardiovascular Disease Management.,2020-05-30,"UNLABELLED The droplets exhaled by an index patient with infectious disease such as influenza or tuberculosis may be the carriers of contagious agents. Indoor environments such as the airliner cabins may be susceptible to infection from such airborne contagious agents. The present investigation computed the transport of the droplets exhaled by the index patient seated in the middle of a seven-row, twin-aisle, fully occupied cabin using the CFD simulations. The droplets exhaled were from a single cough, a single breath, and a 15-s talk of the index patient. The expiratory droplets were tracked by using Lagrangian method, and their evaporation was modeled. It was found that the bulk airflow pattern in the cabin played the most important role on the droplet transport. The droplets were contained in the row before, at, and after the index patient within 30 s and dispersed uniformly to all the seven rows in 4 minutes. The total airborne droplet fraction reduced to 48, 32, 20, and 12% after they entered the cabin for 1, 2, 3, and 4 min, respectively, because of the ventilation from the environmental control system. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS It is critical to predict the risk of airborne infection to take appropriate measures to control and mitigate the risk. Most of the studies in past either assume a homogenous distribution of contaminants or use steady-state conditions. The present study instead provides information on the transient movement of the droplets exhaled by an index passenger in an aircraft cabin. These droplets may contain active contagious agents and can be potent enough to cause infection. The findings can be used by medical professionals to estimate the spatial and temporal distribution of risk of infection to various passengers in the cabin.","Gupta, Jitendra K; Lin, Chao-Hsin; Chen, Qingyan",Indoor air,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0668.2010.00676.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21208287/,495

METHODS The short-term outcomes of robotic sphincter-preserving surgery (n = 130) were retrospectively compared to open (n = 234) and laparoscopic surgery (n = 318) by a propensity score analysis. RESULTS Robotic surgery was performed more frequently for patients with lower rectal cancer (55%) than open (30%, p < 0.0001) or laparoscopic surgery (36%, p < 0.0001). None of the robotic surgery cases were converted to open surgery. After propensity score matching, robotic surgery was found to be associated with a longer operation time (342 vs. 230 min, p < 0.0001) and less blood loss (7 vs. 420 mL, p < 0.0001) than open surgery. The overall complication rate of robotic surgery was lower than that of open surgery (13 vs. 28%, p = 0.032). Robotic surgery was associated with a lower incidence of surgical site infections (SSIs) than laparoscopic surgery (0 vs. 7%, p = 0.028). There were no cases of anastomotic leakage after robotic surgery. The circumferential resection margin was involved in 0.8% of the patients who underwent robotic surgery; the incidence did not differ among the treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS Although robotic surgery for rectal cancer was associated with a longer operation time, it was associated with a very low incidence of SSIs. The degree of safety was comparable to both open and laparoscopic surgery.","Ishihara, Soichiro; Kiyomatsu, Tomomichi; Kawai, Kazushige; Tanaka, Toshiaki; Hata, Keisuke; Kazama, Shinsuke; Sunami, Eiji; Nozawa, Hiroaki; Watanabe, Toshiaki",International journal of colorectal disease,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00384-018-3056-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29687373/,495

METHODS Sixty-seven patients with 76 IDAs were consecutively enrolled in the study from December 2011 to May 2013. DSA was performed to diagnose an IDA and to categorize its angiography patterns into either aneurysmal dilation, steno-occlusive, combined, or unclassifiable. Images of 3T high-resolution MRI were used to evaluate arterial wall imaging features of each lesion. Chi-squared tests were used for statistical analyses. RESULTS Aneurysmal dilation (51 of 76, [67%]) was the most common angiography pattern of IDAs, followed by the combined pattern (20 of 76, [26%]). Seven percent (five of 76) of IDAs showed steno-occlusive (n = 3) and unclassifiable (n = 2) angiography patterns, in which intramural hematomas were detected in the arterial wall without luminal connection. Intimal flaps (32 of 76, [42%]), double-lumen sign (38 of 76, [50%]) and intramural hematomas (46 of 76, [61%]) were recognized as the characteristic features of dissection by high-resolution MRI. Intramural hematomas occurred more frequently in the combined patterns group (16 of 20, [80 %]) than in the aneurysmal dilation group (25 of 51, [49%]) (P = .017), while the occurrence of intimal flaps and double-lumen sign did not differ between angiographic patterns (P > .05). CONCLUSIONS 3T high-resolution MRI combined with DSA offered clear visualization of vessel wall features and accurate assessment of the vessel lumen in IDAs. This combined approach would be highly useful for understanding the underlying pathological status of IDAs and in guiding treatment choices.","Wang, Yanmin; Lou, Xin; Li, Youxiang; Sui, Binbin; Sun, Shengjun; Li, Chuanhui; Jiang, Peng; Siddiqui, Adnan; Yang, Xinjian",Acta neurochirurgica,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00701-013-1989-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24420008/,495

METHODS Using in-depth interviews (N = 14) and framework analysis, we describe how policymakers developed, adopted, and implemented regulations governing services for substance use disorders during COVID-19, and how policymakers' perceived the impacts of these regulations in New York State. RESULTS During the COVID-19 pandemic, policymakers shifted to more inclusive approaches of knowledge generation and co-production of recommendations. Barriers to adoption and implementation of new regulations included medication/services supply, lack of integration, stigma, and overcriminalization. CONCLUSION Findings from this study highlight the potential feasibility and benefits of co-produced policies for substance use services and the need for consistent service supply, better integration with health care services, reduced stigma, improved funding structures, best practice guidelines, criminal justice reform, and harm reduction support.

Methods Anti-EBOV antibody was measured by 2 neutralization and 2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) in convalescent plasma (ECP) from 100 EVD survivor donors in Liberia. Viral load was assessed repetitively in patients with EVD participating in a clinical trial of enhanced standard of care plus ECP. Results All 4 anti-EBOV assays were highly concordant for detection of EBOV antibody. Antibodies were not detected in plasma specimens obtained from 15 of 100 donors, including 7 with documented EBOV-positive reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction during EVD. Viral load was reduced following each dose in the 2 clinical trial participants who received ECP with higher antibody levels but not in the 2 who received ECP with lower antibody levels. Conclusions Recovery from EVD can occur with absence of detectable anti-EBOV antibody several months after disease onset. ELISAs may be useful to select ECP donors or identify ECP units that contain neutralizing antibody. ECP with higher anti-EBOV antibody levels may have greater effect on EBOV load-an observation that requires further investigation.

121916,Parenting Interventions in Pediatric Primary Care: A Systematic Review.,2020-06-24,"BACKGROUND Although pertussis cases globally have been controlled through the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI), the incidence of pertussis has increased significantly in recent years, with a ""resurgence"" of pertussis occurring in developed countries with high immunization coverage. Attracted by its fast-developing economy, the population of Shenzhen has reached 14 million and has become one of the top five largest cities by population size in China. The incidence of pertussis here was about 2.02/100,000, far exceeding that of the whole province and the whole country (both < 1/100,000). There are increasing numbers of reports demonstrating variation in Bordetella pertussis antigens and genes, which may be associated with the increased incidence. Fifty strains of Bordetella pertussis isolated from 387 suspected cases were collected in Shenzhen in 2018 for genotypic and molecular epidemiological analysis. METHODS There were 387 suspected cases of pertussis enrolled at surveillance sites in Shenzhen from June to August 2018. Nasopharyngeal swabs from suspected pertussis cases were collected for bacterial culture and the identity of putative Bordetella pertussis isolates was confirmed by real-time PCR. The immunization history of each patient was taken. The acellular pertussis vaccine (APV) antigen genes for pertussis toxin (ptxA, ptxC), pertactin (prn) and fimbriae (fim2 and fim3) together with the pertussis toxin promoter region (ptxP) were analyzed by second-generation sequencing. Genetic and phylogenetic analysis was performed using sequences publicly available from GenBank, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/ ). The antimicrobial susceptibility was test by Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion. RESULTS Fifty strains of Bordetella pertussis were successfully isolated from nasopharyngeal swabs of 387 suspected cases, with a positivity rate of 16.79%, including 28 males and 22 females, accounting for 56.0% and 44.0% respectively. Thirty-eight of the 50 (76%) patients were found to be positive for B. pertussis by culture. Among the positive cases with a history of vaccination, 30 of 42 (71.4%) cases had an incomplete pertussis vaccination history according to the national recommendation. Three phylogenetic groups (PG1-PG3) were identified each containing a predominant genotype. The two vaccines strains, CS and Tohama I, were distantly related to these three groups. Thirty-one out of fifty (62%) isolates belonged to genotype PG1, with the allelic profile prn2/ptxC2/ptxP3/ptxA1/fim3-1/fim2-1. Eighteen out of fifty (36%) isolates contained the A2047G mutation and were highly resistant to erythromycin, and all belonged to genotype PG3 (prn1/ptxA1/ptxP1/ptxC1/fim3-1/fim2-1), which is closely related to the recent epidemic strains found in northern China. CONCLUSIONS The positive rate of cases under one-year-old was significantly higher than that of other age groups and should be monitored. The dominant antigen genotypes of 50 Shenzhen isolates are closely related to the epidemic strains in the United States, Australia and many countries in Europe. Despite high rates of immunization with APV, epidemics of pertussis have recently occurred in these countries. Therefore, genomic analysis of circulating isolates of B. pertussis should be continued, for it will benefit the control of whooping cough and development of improved vaccines and therapeutic strategies.","Wu, Shuang; Hu, Qinghua; Yang, Chao; Zhou, Haijian; Chen, Hongyu; Zhang, Yanwei; Jiang, Min; He, Yuxiang; Shi, Xiaolu",Annals of clinical microbiology and antimicrobials,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12941-021-00458-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34407803/,495

123168,"The Relationship Between Physical Fitness Qualities and Sport-Specific Technical Skills in Female, Team-Based Ball Players: A Systematic Review.",2020-04-15,"BACKGROUND Orthopaedic surgery training programs have lagged behind other surgical specialties in increasing their representation of women and people from under-represented minority (URM) groups. Comparative data between orthopaedic surgery and other specialties are needed to help identify solutions to closing the diversity gap. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES (1) Which surgical specialties have the greatest representation of women residents and residents from URM groups? (2) How have the proportions of women residents and residents from URM groups changed across the surgical specialties during the past decade? METHODS This was a retrospective evaluation of a large, longitudinally maintained survey database. Resident data by gender and ethnicity were retrieved from the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education Data Resource Books for the 2011 to 2012 through 2019 to 2020 academic years. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education database is updated annually; thus, it is the most up-to-date and complete database available for gender and ethnicity data for all surgical residents. Data were obtained and analyzed for seven different surgical specialties: orthopaedic surgery, neurosurgery, ophthalmology, otolaryngology, plastic surgery, general surgery, and urology. No sampling was necessary, and thus descriptive statistics of the data were completed. Because the entire population of residents was included for the period of time in question, no statistical comparisons were made, and the reported differences represent absolute differences between the groups for these periods. Linear regression analyses were performed to estimate the annual growth rates of women residents and residents from URM groups in each specialty. RESULTS Among the seven surgical specialties, representation of women residents increased from 28% (4640 of 16,854) or residents in 2012 to 33% (6879 of 20,788) in 2020. Orthopaedic surgery had the lowest representation of women residents every year, with women residents comprising 16% of residents (700 of 4342) in 2020. Among the seven surgical specialties, representation of residents from URM groups increased from 8.1% (1362 of 16,854) in 2012 to 9.7% (2013 of 20,788) in 2020. In 2020, the representation of residents from URM groups in orthopaedic surgery was 7.7% (333 of 4342). In 2020, general surgery had the highest representation of women residents (42%; 3696 of 8809) as well as residents from URM groups (12%; 1065 of 8809). Plastic surgery (1.46% per year) and general surgery (0.95% per year) had larger annual growth rates of women residents than the other specialties did. In each surgical specialty, the annual growth rate of residents from URM groups was insignificant. CONCLUSION During the past decade, there was only a small increase in the representation of women in orthopaedic surgery, while the representation of people from URM groups did not change. In contrast, by 2020, general surgery had become the most diverse among the seven surgical specialties. To increase diversity in our field, we need to evaluate and implement some of the effective interventions that have helped general surgery become the diverse surgical specialty that it is today. CLINICAL RELEVANCE General surgery has substantially reduced gender and ethnic disparities that existed in the past, while those in orthopaedic surgery still persist. General surgery residencies have implemented a holistic review of resident applications and longitudinal mentoring programs to successfully address these disparities. Orthopaedic surgery programs should consider placing less emphasis on United States Medical Licensing Examination score thresholds and more weight on applicants' non-academic attributes, and put more efforts into targeted longitudinal mentorship programs, some of which should be led by non-minority faculty.","Haffner, Max R; Van, Benjamin W; Wick, Joseph B; Le, Hai V",Clinical orthopaedics and related research,https://doi.org/10.1097/corr.0000000000001881; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34180873/,495

This study aimed to explore the impact of bacterial colonization on the severity of virus-induced wheezing, and accompanying airway inflammation. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) from 68 hospitalized children with bronchiolitis and 85 children with recurrent wheezing were obtained. Eleven common respiratory viruses were sought by PCR and/or direct fluorescence assay. Bacteria were isolated from NPAs by routine culture methods. Cell numbers and concentrations of cytokines/chemokines in the NPAs were measured, and nucleated cells were characterized. The frequency of bacterial colonization in children with recurrent wheezing was significantly higher than in children with an initial attack of bronchiolitis. Bacterial colonization accompanying virus infection had no effect on clinical manifestations, duration of hospitalization, concentrations of cytokines/chemokines (except interleukin-10 (IL-10)) or cellularity in the children with bronchiolitis; however, among the children with recurrent wheezing, those who had coexistent non-invasive bacterial colonization and virus infection presented more frequent cyanosis, longer duration of hospitalization, a higher concentration of IL-10 and a higher percentage of neutrophils in NPAs than those with virus infection but without bacterial colonization. Bacterial colonization was common in children with virus-induced wheezing, particularly in the situation of recurrent wheezing. To some extent, bacterial colonization accompanying virus infection may contribute to the severity of the wheezing because of its impact on airway inflammation.","Yu, D; Wei, L; Zhengxiu, L; Jian, L; Lijia, W; Xiqiang, Y; Xiaodong, Z; Zhou, F; Enmei, L",Clinical microbiology and infection : the official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-0691.2009.03147.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20041894/,495

Currently, therapeutic options for COVID-19 are limited. Historically, metal compounds have found use as antimicrobial agents, but their antiviral activities have rarely been explored. Here, we test a set of metallodrugs and related compounds, and identify ranitidine bismuth citrate, a commonly used drug for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection, as a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent, both in vitro and in vivo. Ranitidine bismuth citrate exhibited low cytotoxicity and protected SARS-CoV-2-infected cells with a high selectivity index of 975. Importantly, ranitidine bismuth citrate suppressed SARS-CoV-2 replication, leading to decreased viral loads in both upper and lower respiratory tracts, and relieved virus-associated pneumonia in a golden Syrian hamster model. In vitro studies showed that ranitidine bismuth citrate and its related compounds exhibited inhibition towards both the ATPase (IC50 = 0.69 µM) and DNA-unwinding (IC50 = 0.70 µM) activities of the SARS-CoV-2 helicase via an irreversible displacement of zinc(II) ions from the enzyme by bismuth(III) ions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective review was performed of seven consecutive patients (six men and one woman; mean age, 64 y ± 8) with unilateral periacetabular tumors (mean size, 4.2 cm ± 1.4) treated with cryoablation and balloon-assisted osteoplasty for fracture prevention. Cortical defects were seen in six (86%) tumors, and additional pathologic fractures occurred in five (71%) tumors before treatment. The cohort included six (86%) Harrington class I defects and one (14%) class II defect. Procedures were performed with computed tomography fluoroscopic guidance and general anesthesia. Vertebral augmentation balloons (mean, 2; range, 1-4) were inflated within the ablation cavity immediately before or during cement injection. RESULTS All procedures were technically successful. Median percentage tumor fill was 63% (range, 17%-96%). Minor cement leakage occurred in two (29%) patients with no symptomatic or intraarticular extravasation. A new nondisplaced fracture occurred in one patient and was conservatively managed. No major complications occurred. Local tumor progression occurred in one (20%) of five patients with imaging follow-up.

Unlike crises in the more recent past, such as the bombing of the Twin Towers and Pentagon on 9/11, COVID-19 is an ongoing global pandemic, affecting nearly every person on the planet in some shape or form. It is not only the physical effects of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that are lethal; the mental health effects are also taking their toll. The impact of physical distancing, stay-at-home orders, job loss, isolation, and fear have resulted in a considerably greater number of people's experiencing symptoms of anxiety disorder and depressive disorder in the United States. Accessing health care services has been a particular challenge given concerns about exposure to the virus and an overwhelmed health care delivery system. In response, policymakers at the federal and state levels implemented changes aimed at addressing access to essential care to include telehealth services. As the public experiences firsthand the struggles of coping with mental health issues in a fragmented dysfunctional health system, there is an opportunity is to use this crisis as a springboard to advocate for permanent changes to promote telehealth, to elevate the importance of integrated behavioral health, and to support the destigmatization of mental illness.

IR and Raman spectroscopic analyses confirmed the monoclinic structure of SmAl3(BO3)4. Under 532.1 nm excitation, luminescence spectra exhibit bands assignable to the transitions from 4G5/2 to 6H5/2, 6H7/2, 6H9/2 and 6H11/2. The similarity of the luminescence spectra of the trigonal and monoclinic polymorphs is explained by the minor role of Sm-O bond distortion and the primary role of rotational distortion of SmO6 octahedra. The smaller covalency of the Sm-O bond in alumoborates is deduced in comparison with galloborates.

Twenty beef calves were randomly assigned to either group 1 and vaccinated intranasally with a MLV vaccine containing bovine alphaherpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), and bovine parainfluenza virus 3 (BPIV-3), or to group 2 and vaccinated subcutaneously with a MLV vaccine containing bovine viral diarrhea virus 1 and 2 (BVDV-1, -2), BoHV-1, BRSV, and BPIV-3. Deep nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and transtracheal washes (TTW) were collected from all calves, and whole blood was collected from group 2 calves and tested by PCR. In group 1, the proportions of calves that tested PCR-positive to BVDV, BoHV-1, BRSV, and BPIV-3 on any sample at any time were 0%, 100%, 100%, and 10%, respectively. In group 1 calves, 100% of calves became PCR-positive for BoHV-1 by day 3 post-vaccination and 100% of calves became PCR-positive for BRSV by day 7 post-vaccination. In group 2, the proportions of calves that tested positive to BVDV, BoHV-1, BRSV, and BPIV-3 on any sample at any time were 50%, 40%, 10%, and 0%, respectively. All threshold cycle (Ct) values were >30 in group 2 calves, irrespective of virus; however, Ct values <25 were observed in group 1 calves from PCR-positive results for BoHV-1 and BRSV. All calves were PCR-negative for all viruses after day 28. Following intranasal MLV viral vaccination, PCR results and Ct values for BRSV and BoHV-1 suggest that attempts to differentiate vaccine virus from natural infection is unreliable.","Walz, Paul H; Newcomer, Benjamin W; Riddell, Kay P; Scruggs, Daniel W; Cortese, Victor S","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",https://doi.org/10.1177/1040638717709039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28545321/,495
130356,Neuroleptic malignant syndrome following COVID-19 vaccination.,2021-02-20,"BACKGROUND Proliferative scars in nude mice have demonstrated morphologic and histologic similarities to human hypertrophic scar. Gene knockout technology provides the opportunity to study the effect of deleting immune cells in various disease processes. The authors' objective was to test whether grafting human skin onto T-cell receptor (TCR) αβ-/-γδ-/-, recombination activating gene (RAG)-1-/-, and RAG-2γ-/-c-/- mice results in proliferative scars consistent with human hypertrophic scar and to characterize the morphologic, histologic, and cellular changes that occur after removing immune cells. METHODS Nude TCRαβ-/-γδ-/-, RAG-1-/-, and RAG-2-/-γc-/- mice (n = 20 per strain) were grafted with human skin and euthanized at 30, 60, 120, and 180 days. Controls (n = 5 per strain) were autografted with mouse skin. Scars and normal skin were harvested at each time point. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, Masson's trichrome, and immunohistochemistry for anti-human leukocyte antigen-ABC, α-smooth muscle actin, decorin, and biglycan. RESULTS TCRαβ-/-γδ-/-, RAG-1-/-, and RAG-2-/-γc-/- mice grafted with human skin developed firm, elevated scars with histologic and immunohistochemical similarities to human hypertrophic scar. Autografted controls showed no evidence of pathologic scarring. Knockout animals demonstrated a capacity for scar remodeling not observed in nude mice where reductions in α-smooth muscle actin staining pattern and scar thickness occurred over time. CONCLUSIONS Human skin transplanted onto TCRαβ-/-γδ-/-, RAG-1-/-, and RAG-2-/-γc-/- mice results in proliferative scars with morphologic and histologic features of human hypertrophic scar. Remodeling of proliferative scars generated in knockout animals is analogous to changes in human hypertrophic scar. These animal models may better represent the natural history of human hypertrophic scar.","Momtazi, Moein; Ding, Jie; Kwan, Peter; Anderson, Colin C; Honardoust, Dariush; Goekjian, Serge; Tredget, Edward E",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/prs.0000000000001782; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26595016/,495

131672,RevManHAL: towards automatic text generation in systematic reviews.,2017,"Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is an emerging swine enteropathogenic coronavirus (CoV) that poses economic and public health burdens. Currently, there are no effective antiviral agents against PDCoV. Cryptoporus volvatus often serves as an antimicrobial agent in Traditional Chinese Medicines. This study aimed to evaluate the antiviral activities of ergosterol peroxide (EP) from C. volvatus against PDCoV infection. The inhibitory activity of EP against PDCoV was assessed by using virus titration and performing Quantitative Reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR), Western blotting and immunofluorescence assays in LLC-PK1 cells. The mechanism of EP against PDCoV was analyzed by flow cytometry, RT-qPCR and Western blotting. We found that EP treatment inhibited PDCoV infection in LLC-PK1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Subsequently, we demonstrated that EP blocked virus attachment and entry using RT-qPCR. Time-of-addition assays indicated that EP mainly exerted its inhibitory effect at the early and middle stages in the PDCoV replication cycle. EP also inactivated PDCoV infectivity directly as well as suppressed PDCoV-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, EP treatment decreased the phosphorylation of IκBα and p38 MAPK induced by PDCoV infection as well as the mRNA levels of cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, TNF-α, IFN-α, IFN-β, Mx1 and PKR). These results imply that EP can inhibit PDCoV infection and regulate host immune responses by downregulating the activation of the NF-κB and p38/MAPK signaling pathways in vitro. EP can be used as a potential candidate for the development of a new anti-PDCoV therapy.","Duan, Cong; Ge, Xinna; Wang, Junchi; Wei, Zhanyong; Feng, Wen-Hai; Wang, Jiufeng",International immunopharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2020.107317; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33493866/,495

The best reactor operational conditions to obtain high yield and productivity of 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PDO) as the main product and the role of the polyurethane foam in the growth and retention of suspended and attached biomass in the reactors were investigated. In the experiment at 30 °C with a batch reactor (700 mL), biomass growth was mostly as immobilized attached cells, and the achieved 1,3-PDO yield was up to 0.58 mol mol-gly-1. In the experiment (30 °C) with an upflow anaerobic reactor (717 mL), glycerol loading rates (gly-LR) ranging from 6.94 to 15.47 g gly L-1 day-1 were applied during a 102-day period. During the operation, average 1,3-PDO yield was 0.47 mol mol-gly-1, reaching a maximum of 0.51 mol mol-gly-1 at gly-LR of 13.57 g gly L-1 day-1. High 1,3-PDO productivity (5.35 to 5.44 g L-1 day-1) was obtained when gly-LR was 13.57 to 15.47 g gly L-1 day-1. Comparing the close yield values in both batch and continuous reactors and based on microbial evaluation, it is concluded that most of the 1,3-PDO generated in the continuous reactor was due to the suspended biomass retained by the foam cubes. The Clostridium genus was the predominant 1,3-PDO producer. Good yields and productivities with packed reactors were attributed to polyurethane foam used for mixed culture growth and retention. Consequently, they are worth considering for 1,3-PDO production from pure glycerol.","Veras, Shyrlane T S; Rojas, Patricia; Florencio, Lourdinha; Kato, Mario T; Sanz, José Luis",Environmental science and pollution research international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-10404-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803577/,495

Current techniques require an abdominal incision, albeit smaller than an open laparotomy incision, which increases pain and complication rates such as infection, hernia development, and a less pleasing cosmetic result. The ability to perform a totally intracorporeal anastomosis will be an initial step to allow surgeons to perform natural orifice colon surgery in the future. One benefit of the intracorporeal anastomosis technique is that the only incision needed is for trocar placement. By combining the 2 techniques of totally intracorporeal anastomosis and transvaginal extraction of the specimen, surgeons will have the option to perform a totally laparoscopic colectomy on female patients. This case study describes a patient with a transvaginal route of specimen extraction after an oncologic laparoscopic right colon resection with intracorporeal anastomosis. It is the intent to further advance the technical options in the field of natural orifice surgery with the description of this technique.

The mucin proteins MUC5AC and MUC5B are the major glycoprotein components of mucus and have critical roles in airway defense. Despite the biomedical importance of these two proteins, the loci that regulate them in the context of natural genetic variation have not been studied. To identify genes that underlie variation in airway mucin levels, we performed genetic analyses in founder strains and incipient lines of the Collaborative Cross (CC) in a house dust mite mouse model of asthma. CC founder strains exhibited significant differences in MUC5AC and MUC5B, providing evidence of heritability. Analysis of gene and protein expression of Muc5ac and Muc5b in incipient CC lines (n = 154) suggested that post-transcriptional events were important regulators of mucin protein content in the airways. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping identified distinct, trans protein QTL for MUC5AC (chromosome 13) and MUC5B (chromosome 2). These two QTL explained 18 and 20% of phenotypic variance, respectively. Examination of the MUC5B QTL allele effects and subsequent phylogenetic analysis allowed us to narrow the MUC5B QTL and identify Bpifb1 as a candidate gene. Bpifb1 mRNA and protein expression were upregulated in parallel to MUC5B after allergen challenge, and Bpifb1 knockout mice exhibited higher MUC5B expression. Thus, BPIFB1 is a novel regulator of MUC5B.","Donoghue, Lauren J; Livraghi-Butrico, Alessandra; McFadden, Kathryn M; Thomas, Joseph M; Chen, Gang; Grubb, Barbara R; O'Neal, Wanda K; Boucher, Richard C; Kelada, Samir N P",Genetics,https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.117.300211; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28851744/,495

CASE SUMMARY A 60-year-old man was diagnosed with left UC and was given azathioprine 2.5 mg/kg to control UC symptoms and decrease corticosteroid patient dependence. Four years later, he developed adverse reaction to azathioprine and began treatment with mercaptopurine 1.5 mg/kg/day. Despite this treatment, he developed a severe relapse (Truelove-Witts modified: 15 points). Treatment with IFX 5 mg/kg at weeks 0, 2, 6, and every 8 weeks was started. After 1 year in clinical remission, the patient developed an infusion reaction to IFX, and IFX was suspended. The patient started treatment with ADA 40 mg every other week. After 2 years in clinical remission, ADA was suspended. 20 months after ADA discontinuation, the patient developed an acute episode of UC with a Truelove-Witts modified score of 16 points. ADA plus corticosteroid therapy was restarted. Despite these treatments, the patient's clinical condition did not improved. ADA 40 mg per week was started with not clinical improvement and with corticosteroid dependence after 4 months of ADA intensive therapy. The patient denied surgery, and cyclosporine was discarded because of its inability to be used as a maintenance drug. The patient started GLB with an induction dosage regimen of 200 mg subcutaneous at week 0, followed by 100 mg at week 2, and then maintenance therapy with 100 mg every 4 weeks (patient's weight = 84 kg), combined with mercaptopurine and corticosteroids. After 6 weeks of treatment, the patient achieved clinical remission, with just three non-bleeding stools per day, without stomach ache, apyretic, and no urgency or tenesmus rectal symptoms. One year later, the patient continued to be asymptomatic with a Truelove-Witts modified score of 2 points, corticoid-free treatment, and a complete clinical and endoscopic remission and normal calprotectin levels (< 15 µg/g). We decided to suspend mercaptopurine in order to avoid side effects derived from the combined treatment. After 1 year on GLB therapy, the patient continued in clinical remission. CONCLUSIONS Based on our case, GLB could be selected as an effective approach for patients with UC refractory to IFX and ADA. However, further studies need to be performed to evaluate the efficacy of GLB therapy as a rescue treatment.","Cortes, Xavier; Borrás-Blasco, Joaquín; Flor, Laura; Antequera, Beatríz; Fernandez-Martinez, Sergio; Molés, Jose Ramón; Casterá, Elvira",International journal of clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.5414/cp202621; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33261721/,495

MATERIALS AND METHODS Blinded reviewers retrospectively analyzed 16-MDCT scans of 64 patients who had endoscopic findings of giant gastric folds. Thirty of these patients had histopathologic results showing scirrhous carcinoma; 15, large B-cell lymphoma; 14, acute gastric mucosal lesions; and five, Ménétrier disease. Unenhanced transparent volume-rendered images were assessed to determine the morphologic features of the whole stomach. Contrast-enhanced images were used to analyze wall thickness, stratification, enhancement pattern, and perigastric conditions. We used the Cramer phi-prime correlation coefficient to calculate the overall diagnostic accuracy of MDCT in several gastric disorders. Scatterplot analysis was used for overall diagnostic score, and analysis of the receiver operator characteristic curves of the neighboring two diseases was used to locate the cutoff values for best diagnostic accuracy. We used exact logistic regression to identify which MDCT image features were most predictive of the presence of malignant gastric disease. RESULTS The gastric wall was found to be significantly thicker in large B-cell lymphoma than in other disorders (p < 0.001). The overall diagnostic accuracy of MDCT in the four diseases was 100%. Loss of wall stratification was deemed the best MDCT predictor of the presence of malignancy. CONCLUSION MDCT may be a reliable means of noninvasive diagnosis in the care of patients with endoscopically detected giant gastric folds and may be useful for differentiating benign from malignant disease.","Chen, Chiao-Yun; Jaw, Twei-Shiun; Wu, Deng-Chyang; Kuo, Yu-Ting; Lee, Chien-Hung; Huang, Wan-Ting; Liu, Gin-Chung",AJR.

As many of the controversies of ISBCS are underpinned by ethical dilemmas, the aim of this work was to explore the ethical perspectives of ISBCS from a variety of stakeholder viewpoints. METHOD A semi-structured independent stakeholder meeting was convened at the Royal College of Ophthalmologists London headquarters in June 2018. In total, 29 stakeholders attended the meeting. The professional characteristics of stakeholders included but were not limited to: ophthalmologists (9), patients (5), religious leaders (4), ethicists (2), lawyers (2) and commissioners (1). Thematic qualitative analysis using methodology proposed by Braun and Clarke was conducted on the resultant transcript of the discussion. RESULTS Themes identified include: (1) beneficence and non-maleficence (patient benefits, patient risks, the uncertainties of risk, patient interpretation of the risk-benefit analysis); (2) autonomy (informed consent, the barriers to communication); (3) distributive justice (the allocation of resources: the individual vs the collective). CONCLUSION This analysis provides a reference point for the ethical factors surrounding ISBCS. The stakeholders concluded that this approach was an ethical undertaking provided patient autonomy was appropriately attained. This requires a patient's interpretation of the risk-benefit balance, which must include an understanding of the low but unquantifiable risk of severe complications. A surgeon must aim to minimise risks through the adaption of accepted surgical protocols and by performing appropriate patient selection. Currently, cost savings to healthcare that may occur following the implementation of ISBCS should be considered a secondary benefit of the protocol.","Quinn, Matthew; Gray, Daniel; Bardan, Ahmed Shalaby; Zarei, Mehran; Sparrow, John; Liu, Christopher",Journal of medical ethics,https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2020-106412; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32958695/,495

Methods: The time sequence transmission map and the cases travel track table were drawn, according to the time of incidence, age, sex, number of close contacts and their interrelations. Results: At the end of February 10, 2020, 63 COVID-19 cases were reported in the research area. Among them, 57 cases were confirmed (1 deaths) and 6 cases were asymptomatic, 57 cases were imported cases (90.48%), 36 cases were reported by cluster epidemic (57.14%) among friends and relatives. Cases have been spread to the fourth generation. Conclusion: The time sequence transmission map and the cases travel track showed that, in the research area, the epidemic situation of COVID-19 was mainly caused by imported case, and the clustering transmission was the major spread model. The time sequence transmission map and the cases travel track are worth popularizing in the prevention and control of major infectious diseases.","Cao, L; Zhou, Y J; Zhang, F; Liu, Y R; Wang, X D; Yi, C; Xu, Q J; Xiao, S; Wang, L",Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20200305-00257; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33297638/,495
141720,The Relationship between Depression and Metabolic Control Parameters in Type 2 Diabetic Patients: A Cross-sectional and Feasibility Interventional Study.,2020-10-23,"PURPOSE This study used meta-analytical techniques to compare the recurrence of granulomatous vs nongranulomatous Crohn disease. METHODS Comparative studies published between 1954 and 2007 of granulomatous vs nongranulomatous Crohn disease were included. Using a random effects model, end points evaluated were the number of recurrences and reoperations, and the time to recurrence and reoperation, of granulomatous vs nongranulomatous Crohn disease. Heterogeneity was assessed and sensitivity analysis was performed to account for bias in patient selection. RESULTS Twenty-one studies (14 nonrandomized retrospective, 7 nonrandomized prospective) reported on 2236 patients with Crohn disease, of whom 1050 (47.0%) had granulomas (granulomatous group) and 1186 (53.0%) had no granulomas (nongranulomatous group). The number of recurrences and reoperations was found to be significantly higher in the granulomatous group compared to the nongranulomatous group (odds ratio 1.37, P = .04; odds ratio 2.38, P < .001; respectively), with significant heterogeneity between studies (P = .06; P < .001; respectively). The time to recurrence and reoperation was significantly shorter in the granulomatous group compared with the nongranulomatous group (hazard ratio 1.63, P = .001; hazard ratio 1.62, P = .002; respectively), with no significant heterogeneity between studies. The number of recurrences and reoperations remained significantly higher in the granulomatous group compared to the nongranulomatous group during sensitivity analysis of higher-quality studies, more recent studies, and studies with a larger group of patients. CONCLUSIONS Granulomatous Crohn disease appears to be associated with a higher number of recurrences and reoperations and a shorter time to recurrence and reoperation compared to nongranulomatous Crohn disease. Because of significant heterogeneity between studies, further studies should be undertaken to confirm these findings.","Simillis, Constantinos; Jacovides, Michael; Reese, George E; Yamamoto, Takayuki; Tekkis, Paris P",Diseases of the colon and rectum,https://doi.org/10.1007/dcr.0b013e3181b7bfb0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20087093/,495
142939,What is the risk of prostate cancer mortality following negative systematic TRUS-guided biopsies? A systematic review.,2020-12-18,"BACKGROUND/AIMS Age, educational experiences, language and culture can affect linguistic-cognitive performance. This is the first systematic study investigating linguistic-cognitive aging in Greek Cypriot adults focusing on executive functioning (EF) and oral naming performance. METHOD Three hundred and fifty-nine participants were included, a group of young-old, aged 60-75 years (n = 231), and a group of old-old participants, aged 76 years and older (n = 128). Participants in each age group were divided into three education groups: 0-4 years (n = 50), 5-9 years (n = 198), and 10 years of education and higher (n = 111). Participants were administered 5 measures of EF along with measures of receptive vocabulary and confrontational naming. RESULTS There was a significant relationship between the EF composite score and all language measures. MANOVA (α = 0.05) indicated significant age and education effects on most measures of EF and language. Performance on receptive vocabulary and cognitive shift remained stable across age groups, but was mediated by education. CONCLUSION Education plays a significant role on all measures requiring semantic organization, speed of information processing, cognitive shift, mental flexibility, receptive vocabulary and confrontational naming. Furthermore, strategic thinking has a role in semantic knowledge, word retrieval and semantic access in healthy aging. We conclude with clinical implications and assessment considerations in aphasia.","Constantinidou, Fofi; Christodoulou, Marianna; Prokopiou, Juliana",Folia phoniatrica et logopaedica : official organ of the International Association of Logopedics and Phoniatrics,https://doi.org/10.1159/000340015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23108448/,495

We report our experience of performing SILC for patients with cholecystitis requiring percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage (PTGBD). METHODS We performed SILC via an SILS-Port with additional 5-mm forceps through an umbilical incision in ten patients with cholecystitis requiring PTGBD. RESULTS All procedures were completed successfully. The mean operative time was 124 min (range 78-169 min) and there were no intraoperative or postoperative complications. The mean postoperative hospital stay was 2.7 days. All patients were satisfied with the cosmetic results. CONCLUSIONS Our procedure may represent an alternative to conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy (CLC) for patients who fervently demand the cosmetic advantages, despite cholecystitis requiring PTGBD. SILC should be performed carefully to avoid bile duct injury because the only advantage of SILC over CLC is cosmetic.","Igami, Tsuyoshi; Aoba, Taro; Ebata, Tomoki; Yokoyama, Yukihiro; Sugawara, Gen; Nagino, Masato",Surgery today,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00595-014-1003-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25139210/,495

STUDY DESIGN Retrospective case series. ANIMALS Donor (n=31) and recipient (n=30) cats that underwent kidney harvest and transplantation using ureteral papilla implantation technique for neoureterocystostomy. METHODS Medical records for donor and recipient cats presented to the University of Wisconsin Veterinary Teaching Hospital from January 2003 to December 2014 were reviewed. Data recorded included complete blood count, serum chemistry panel, surgical technique, diagnostic imaging results, short- and long-term complications, and anesthetic survival. RESULTS All 30 recipients recovered from anesthesia. Four died within 24 hours and 26 survived to hospital discharge. Serum creatinine was within the reference interval by 72 hours in 22/26 cats (85%). Complications related to the ureteral papilla implantation technique were seen in only 1 cat (3%). Uroabdomen diagnosed on day 3 ultimately resolved over the following 24 hours without surgical intervention. All 31 donor cats survived to discharge. Four donors (13%) experienced mild, transiently increased serum creatinine. CONCLUSION Ureteral papilla implantation is a viable technique for neoureterocystostomy in cats undergoing kidney transplantation. Proposed benefits for the recipient include a less technically challenging anastomosis, decreased risk of ureteral obstruction at the anastomosis site, and reduced risk of leakage compared to previous reports. Benefits for recipients should be weighed against risks to donors, including a more complex ureteral harvest, increased surgical time, and potential injury or obstruction of the contralateral ureteral papilla.","Sutherland, Brian J; McAnulty, Jonathan F; Hardie, Robert J",Veterinary surgery : VS,https://doi.org/10.1111/vsu.12476; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27120269/,495

The SCENARIO model is an example of a thermoregulatory model that predicts heat strain including body core temperature (Tc) from individual characteristics, physical activity, clothing properties and environmental conditions. This paper presents work to optimize and enhance the SCENARIO model for prediction of Tc during high intensity load carriage tasks under predominantly tropical climate conditions. Data for model optimization (in-sample analysis) and model external validation were derived from four and two load carriage studies respectively. A total of four parameters characterizing metabolic heat production, sweat evaporation and ice ingestion for hydration were identified for model optimization based on physiological reasoning. The accuracy of Tc estimates was evaluated based on bias, root mean square deviation (RMSD), RMSD based on mean values (RMSD-Mean), and standard deviation fall-in percentage (SDP). Under in-sample analysis, the optimized model achieved bias, RMSD, RMSD-Mean and SDP of 0.01°C, 0.39°C, 0.14°C and 99%, respectively. When externally validated against two sets of unseen data, the model achieved comparable bias, RMSD, RMSD-Mean and SDP values of 0.06°C, 0.32°C, 0.13°C, 92% and 0.08°C, 0.39°C, 0.19°C, 92%, respectively. Overall, the results indicate the robustness of the optimized SCENARIO model for predicting the Tc responses during prolonged, high-intensity physical tasks under hot and humid environments. Future work to further validate the model against data beyond the range of the present study's experimental data and enhancing it for more accurate simulations of other heat strain markers including heart rate is recommended.","Tan, Alvin Pengshi; Cheong, Chee Hoong; Lee, Tong; Seng, Kok Yong; Teo, Chiang Juay",Computers in biology and medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2021.104530; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34118753/,495

145827,Prevalence of mental health problems among children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,2021-06-18,"BACKGROUND There is notable heterogeneity in the clinical presentation of patients with COPD. To characterise this heterogeneity, we sought to identify subgroups of smokers by applying cluster analysis to data from the COPDGene study. METHODS We applied a clustering method, k-means, to data from 10 192 smokers in the COPDGene study. After splitting the sample into a training and validation set, we evaluated three sets of input features across a range of k (user-specified number of clusters). Stable solutions were tested for association with four COPD-related measures and five genetic variants previously associated with COPD at genome-wide significance. The results were confirmed in the validation set. FINDINGS We identified four clusters that can be characterised as (1) relatively resistant smokers (ie, no/mild obstruction and minimal emphysema despite heavy smoking), (2) mild upper zone emphysema-predominant, (3) airway disease-predominant and (4) severe emphysema. All clusters are strongly associated with COPD-related clinical characteristics, including exacerbations and dyspnoea (p<0.001). We found strong genetic associations between the mild upper zone emphysema group and rs1980057 near HHIP, and between the severe emphysema group and rs8034191 in the chromosome 15q region (p<0.001). All significant associations were replicated at p<0.05 in the validation sample (12/12 associations with clinical measures and 2/2 genetic associations). INTERPRETATION Cluster analysis identifies four subgroups of smokers that show robust associations with clinical characteristics of COPD and known COPD-associated genetic variants.","Castaldi, Peter J; Dy, Jennifer; Ross, James; Chang, Yale; Washko, George R; Curran-Everett, Douglas; Williams, Andre; Lynch, David A; Make, Barry J; Crapo, James D; Bowler, Russ P; Regan, Elizabeth A; Hokanson, John E; Kinney, Greg L; Han, Meilan K; Soler, Xavier; Ramsdell, Joseph W; Barr, R Graham; Foreman, Marilyn; van Beek, Edwin; Casaburi, Richard; Criner, Gerald J; Lutz, Sharon M; Rennard, Steven I; Santorico, Stephanie; Sciurba, Frank C; DeMeo, Dawn L; Hersh, Craig P; Silverman, Edwin K; Cho, Michael H",Thorax,https://doi.org/10.1136/thoraxjnl-2013-203601; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24563194/,495
146025,"Protecting Pregnant Women and Their Infants From COVID-19: Clues From Maternal Viral Loads, Antibody Responses, and Placentas.",2020-12-01,"INTRODUCTION The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by symptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, has wreaked havoc globally, challenging the healthcare, economical, technological and social status quo of developing but also developed countries. For instance, the COVID-19 scare has reduced timely hospital admissions for ST-elevation myocardial infarction in Europe and the USA, causing unnecessary deaths and disabilities. While the emergency is still ongoing, enough efforts have been put to study and tackle this condition such that a comprehensive perspective and synthesis on the potential role of breakthrough healthcare technologies is possible. Indeed, current state-of-the-art information technologies can provide a unique opportunity to adapt and adjust to the current healthcare needs associated with COVID-19, either directly or indirectly, and in particular those of cardiovascular patients and practitioners. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION We searched several biomedical databases, websites and social media, including PubMed, Medscape, and Twitter, for smartcare approaches suitable for application in the COVID-19 pandemic. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS We retrieved details on several promising avenues for present and future healthcare technologies, capable of substantially reduce the mortality, morbidity, and resource use burden of COVID-19 as well as that of cardiovascular disease. In particular, we have found data supporting the importance of data sharing, model sharing, preprint archiving, social media, medical case sharing, distance learning and continuous medical education, smartphone apps, telemedicine, robotics, big data analysis, machine learning, and deep learning, with the ultimate goal of optimization of individual prevention, diagnosis, tracing, risk-stratification, treatment and rehabilitation. CONCLUSIONS We are confident that refinement and command of smartcare technologies will prove extremely beneficial in the short-term, but also dramatically reshape cardiovascular practice and healthcare delivery in the long-term future.","Nudi, Raffaele; Campagna, Marco; Parma, Alessio; Nudi, Andrea; Biondi-Zoccai, Giuseppe",Panminerva medica,https://doi.org/10.23736/s0031-0808.20.04188-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33165308/,495

When the standards that review boards use to evaluate research proposals are applied to review board practices, it is clear that review boards do not respect researchers or each other, lack merit and integrity, are not just and are not beneficent. The few benefits of mandatory ethical review come at a much greater, but mainly hidden, social cost.

Here we describe two self-copying (or active) guide RNA-only genetic elements, called e-CHACRs and ERACRs. These elements use Cas9 produced in trans by a gene drive either to inactivate the cas9 transgene (e-CHACRs) or to delete and replace the gene drive (ERACRs). e-CHACRs can be inserted at various genomic locations and carry two or more gRNAs, the first copying the e-CHACR and the second mutating and inactivating the cas9 transgene. Alternatively, ERACRs are inserted at the same genomic location as a gene drive, carrying two gRNAs that cut on either side of the gene drive to excise it. e-CHACRs efficiently inactivate Cas9 and can drive to completion in cage experiments. Similarly, ERACRs, particularly those carrying a recoded cDNA-restoring endogenous gene activity, can drive reliably to fully replace a gene drive. We compare the strengths of these two systems.","Xu, Xiang-Ru Shannon; Bulger, Emily A; Gantz, Valentino M; Klanseck, Carissa; Heimler, Stephanie R; Auradkar, Ankush; Bennett, Jared B; Miller, Lauren Ashley; Leahy, Sarah; Juste, Sara Sanz; Buchman, Anna; Akbari, Omar S; Marshall, John M; Bier, Ethan",Molecular cell,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2020.09.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32949493/,495

148260,Will Improvements in Patient Experience With Care Impact Clinical and Quality of Care Outcomes?: A Systematic Review.,2021-06-23,"BACKGROUND The travel screen was implemented by emergency departments (EDs) across the country in 2014 to detect patients exposed to Ebola early and prevent local outbreaks. It remains part of the triage protocol in many EDs to detect communicable disease from abroad and has become a defacto screen for other travel-related illness. Its utility has not been studied in the pediatric ED. METHODS This was a retrospective review of electronic medical records across 3 EDs from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2016. The screening question reads, ""Has the child or a close contact of the child traveled outside the United States in the past 21 days?"" A follow-up question requesting travel details is included for positive screens. We compared length of stay, return-visit rates, and differences in disposition between patients with positive and negative travel screens using generalized linear regression. Matched regression estimates, 95% confidence intervals, and P values were reported. RESULTS The study population included 152,945 patients with a total of 322,229 encounters in 2016, of which 232,787 encounters had a travel screen documented during triage. There were 2258 patient encounters that had positive travel screens. Only 201 (8.9%) of these encounters had further description of the travel in the comments box. The odds of hospital admission for patients with positive travel screens were 1.76 (95% confidence interval, 1.54-2.01; P < 0.001) times the odds of hospital admission for patients screened negative. The significance of this finding was largely driven by general hospital admission. Other metrics did not differ significantly between the groups. CONCLUSIONS Although a positive travel screen was mildly predictive of inpatient admission, information is not available to providers about travel-related risk. Recent literature suggests integrating a travel history with presenting symptoms and region of travel and could produce a more specific travel screen. A revised travel screen should be implemented and studied in the pediatric ED.","Greenky, David; Gillespie, Scott; Levine, Aly; Murray, Brittany",Pediatric emergency care,https://doi.org/10.1097/pec.0000000000002116; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32384394/,495

METHODS We analyzed data from the Healthy Minds Study (Fall Semester Cohort 2020), a non-probability sample of students across multiple colleges who completed an online survey between September - December 2020. Using multivariable logistic regression, we examined the associations between COVID-19 dimensions (concern, racial/ethnic discrimination, financial distress, infection, illness of loved one, death of loved one, caregiving) and mental health outcomes (depression, anxiety), adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, and international student status. RESULTS Nearly a fifth of the sample reported moderately severe or severe depression, and nearly a third reported moderately severe or severe anxiety over the past two weeks. When accounting for all COVID-19 dimensions in the same model, COVID-19 concern, racial/ethnic discrimination, financial distress, and infection were significantly associated with moderately severe or severe depression; COVID-19 concern, financial distress, and infection were significantly associated with moderately severe or severe anxiety. CONCLUSIONS This study showed that the COVID-19 pandemic may have shaped mental health through a range of potential social and environmental dimensions. Interventions are required that consider multiple dimensions of COVID-19 to improve mental health during and after the pandemic.","Oh, Hans; Marinovich, Caitlin; Rajkumar, Ravi; Besecker, Megan; Zhou, Sasha; Jacob, Louis; Koyanagi, Ai; Smith, Lee",Journal of affective disorders,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.05.121; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34134025/,495

CD4 memory T cells from individuals older than 65 y displayed increased and sustained transcription of the dual-specific phosphatase 4 (DUSP4) that shortened expression of CD40-ligand (CD40L) and inducible T-cell costimulator (ICOS) (both P < 0.001) and decreased production of IL-4, IL-17A, and IL-21 (all P < 0.001) after in vitro activation. In vivo after influenza vaccination, activated CD4 T cells from elderly individuals had increased DUSP4 transcription (P = 0.002), which inversely correlated with the expression of CD40L (r = 0.65, P = 0.002), ICOS (r = 0.57, P = 0.008), and IL-4 (r = 0.66, P = 0.001). In CD4 KO mice reconstituted with DUSP4 OT-II T cells, DUSP4 had a negative effect on the expansion of antigen-specific B cells (P = 0.003) and the production of ova-specific antibodies (P = 0.03) after immunization. Silencing of DUSP4 in memory CD4 T cells improved CD40L (P < 0.001), IL-4 (P = 0.007), and IL-21 (P = 0.04) expression significantly more in the elderly than young adults. Consequently, the ability of CD4 memory T cells to support B-cell differentiation that was impaired in the elderly (P = 0.004) was restored. Our data suggest that increased DUSP4 expression in activated T cells in the elderly in part accounts for defective adaptive immune responses.","Yu, Mingcan; Li, Guangjin; Lee, Won-Woo; Yuan, Ming; Cui, Dapeng; Weyand, Cornelia M; Goronzy, Jörg J",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1109797109; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22434910/,495

Nine of ten procedures were performed successfully, without the use of additional trocars, or conversion to laparotomy. One patient underwent conversion to multiport laparoscopic surgery, to get simultaneous cholecystectomy safely. The mean operating time was 66.5 minutes (range, 24~132 minutes), and the mean postoperative hospital stay was 5 days (range, 4~7 days). No serious perioperative complications were observed. Of the 10 submucosal tumors, the final pathologic report revealed 5 gastrointestinal stromal tumors, 4 schwannomas, and 1 heterotopic pancreas. CONCLUSIONS Single-incision laparoscopic gastric wedge resection for gastric submucosal tumors is feasible and safe, when performed by experienced laparoscopic surgeons. This technique provides favorable cosmetic results, and also short hospital stay and low morbidity, in carefully selected candidates.","Park, Ji Yeon; Eom, Bang Wool; Yoon, Hongman; Ryu, Keun Won; Kim, Young-Woo; Lee, Jun Ho",Journal of gastric cancer,https://doi.org/10.5230/jgc.2012.12.3.173; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23094229/,495
153987,Guideline Recommendations for Oral Care After Acquired Brain Injury: Protocol for a Systematic Review.,2020-07-01,"INTRODUCTION In Taiwan, severe enteroviral infections must be reported to the government within 24 hours to ensure that severe enterovirus 71 (EV71) infections can be detected early. The objective of this research was to ascertain whether over-reporting is a problem in mandatory disease-reporting systems. METHODOLOGY A multiyear cross-sectional study methodology was applied based on secondary data analyses. Data from the national notifiable communicable disease surveillance system of Taiwan Centers for Disease Control were analyzed to assess the trends and factors influencing reporting accuracy. RESULTS From July 1999 to December 2008, 2,611 cases of severe enteroviral infection were reported in Taiwan. Among these cases, 1,516 were confirmed to be EV71 cases, and the remaining 1,095 were confirmed to be non-EV71 infections. The overall accuracy rate was 58%. The accuracy rate was 60%-70% higher during epidemics (2000-2002, 2005, and 2008) and high seasons than it was in other seasons. The accuracy rate was highest among medical centers and lowest among district hospitals. CONCLUSIONS The results indicated that reports are more accurate during high seasons and peak years than during other periods. This might be attributable to the adequate level of specific educational programs for professionals when more cases occur, which could facilitate identification. Based on experiences in Taiwan, optimal training can ensure that surveillance systems are not inundated by false-positive reports.","Chu-Chun, Tseng; Che-Ming, Yang",Journal of infection in developing countries,https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.4623; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25313606/,495
155039,Geographical information systems and tropical medicine.,2010,"BACKGROUND Bordetella pertussis is the causative agent of pertussis, a respiratory tract infectious disease. Efficient techniques for detection of B. pertussis isolates are important for clinical diagnosis. Multiple cross displacement amplification (MCDA), a novel isothermal amplification based molecular detection method, has been developed to overcome the technical drawback of the current methods in recent years. This aim of this study is to develop a MCDA with Nanoparticles-based Lateral Flow Biosensor (MCDA-LFB) for the detection of B. pertussis. RESULTS A set of 10 primers based on the pertussis toxin (PT) promoter region sequence of B. pertussis was designed. The B. pertussis-MCDA-LFB assay was successfully established and optimized at 64 °C for reaction of 40 min. The detection limit was determined as 10 fg/reaction of pure DNA, and no cross-reactions to non-B. pertussis strains were observed, based on the specificity validation. The whole operation, ranging from template preparation to result reporting, could be completed within 70 min without requirement of costly equipment. The B. pertussis-MCDA-LFB in clinic sample detection yielded identical positive rates with traditional culture and showed higher sensitivity than conventional PCR. The results of MCDA-LFB are easier to read due to the usage of LFB. CONCLUSIONS The isothermal amplification based MCDA-LFB established in the present study is a specific, sensitive, rapid and economical technique for the detection of B. pertussis.","Li, Shijun; Liu, Chunting; Liu, Ying; Ma, Qing; Wang, Yue; Wang, Yi",BMC microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12866-020-01945-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32831029/,495
155721,The Impact of Prior Use of Corticosteroid to Dental Extraction on Oral Health-Related Quality of Life and Clinical Outcomes: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,2020-08-15,"Background Subxiphoid approach for mediastinal tumor resection was reported to provide a better view and less postoperative pain. Non-intubated video-assisted thoracic surgery (NI-VATS) without muscle relaxant would decrease the possibility of postoperative airway collapse for anterior mediastinal mass operation. Herein, we sought to describe the use of NI-VATS through subxiphoid approach for anterior mediastinal tumor resection. Methods In this retrospective cohort study, patients that underwent subxiphoid VATS resection for anterior mediastinal tumor between December 2015 and September 2019 were divided into two groups: NI-VATS and intubated VATS (I-VATS). Intraoperative and postoperative variables were compared. Results A total of 40 patients were included. Among them, 21 patients received NI-VATS (52.5%) and 19 were treated with I-VATS (47.5%). In total, intraoperative (4/21 vs. 2/19; P=0.446) and postoperative complications (5/21 vs. 7/19; P=0.369) were similar between NI-VATS and I-VATS group. The anesthesia time (231.76 vs. 244.71 min; P=0.218), the operation time (152.35 vs. 143.64 min; P=0.980), chest tube duration (1.81 vs. 1.84 days; P=0.08), the total volume (351.95 vs. 348.00 mL; P=0.223), post-operative pain scores (2.79 vs. 2.93, P=0.413), and the length of stay (9.47 vs. 10.57 days; P=0.970) were all comparable between two groups. Conclusions NI-VATS for mediastinal tumor resection via subxiphoid approach is a safe and technically feasible option in selected patients, which leads to comparable perioperative clinical outcomes when compared with I-VATS via the subxiphoid approach. This technique could be used as an alteration when intubation is not available.","Mao, Yong; Liang, Hengrui; Deng, Shiqi; Qiu, Yuan; Zhou, Yanran; Chen, Hanzhang; Jiang, Long; He, Jianxing",Annals of translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/atm-20-6125; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33842624/,495

The study uses the numbers of active cases for each county in Romania, as well as Bucharest and the whole country, reported daily by the Romanian Ministry of Health (https://datelazi.ro) between April 2nd, 2020 and January 25th, 2021. We compared the disease's evolution in Suceava county (the first outbreak of spread) with other counties in Romania in order to highlight the gaps between them. We calculated the cross-correlations between counties, interpreted as time series. The recorded lags varied between 1-15 days, the most counties having a lag of 6-7 days compared with Suceava. Therefore, on long term there are no important discrepancies between the regions in Romania regarding the evolution of the disease, which shows that the intervention efforts of the medical staff were uniform in efficiency. The existence of a lag of only one day between Suceava and the whole country shows that on long term, even in this county the situation is not very discrepant, belonging to the general evolution.","Dascalu, Cristina Gena; Antohe, Magda Ecaterina; Purcarea, Victor Lorin",Studies in health technology and informatics,https://doi.org/10.3233/shti210269; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34042673/,495

BACKGROUND SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of severe coronavirus disease, a significant public health concern that quickly led to a pandemic. Contamination of environmental surface materials is of concern, with previous studies identifying long-term detection of infectious particles on surfaces. These contaminated surfaces create an increased risk for contact transmission. METHODS Surface materials were inoculated with 10,000 plaque forming units and samples were collected 4, 8, 12, 24, 30, 48, and 168 hours post infection (hpi). Viral titers were determined for each sample and time point using plaque assays. Nonparametric modeling utilized the Turnbull algorithm for interval-censored data. Maximum likelihood estimates for the survival curve were calculated. Parametric proportional hazards regression models for interval censored data were used to explore survival time across the surface materials. RESULTS There was a sharp decline in recoverable virus after 4 hpi for all tested surfaces. By 12 hpi, infectious SARS-CoV-2 was recoverable from only four surfaces; and by 30 hr, the virus was recoverable from only one surface. There were differences in survival curves based on the materials although some groups of materials are similar, both statistically and practically. CONCLUSIONS While very low amounts of infectious SARS-CoV-2 are recoverable over time, there remains a risk of viral transmission by surface contamination in indoor environments. Individuals and institutions must follow appropriate procedures to decontaminate indoor environment and increase diligence for hand hygiene and personal protective equipment.","Ronca, Shannon E; Sturdivant, Rodney X; Barr, Kelli L; Harris, Debra",HERD,https://doi.org/10.1177/1937586721991535; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33618545/,495

Technological solutions are needed to support the early discharge of the patients just after the primary hospital treatments, by still providing an adequate level of rehabilitation. The DoMoMEA Project proposes a fully-wearable m-health solution able to administer a neurorehabilitation therapy in the patient's home or every other place established by the patient for a rehabilitation session. The exploitation of magneto-inertial measurement units only, wirelessly connected to an Android-operated device, provides robustness to different operating conditions and immunity to optical occlusion problems, compared to RGB-D cameras. Patients' engagement is fostered by the exploitation of the exergame version of the ten rehabilitation exercises, implemented in Unity 3D. Store-and-forward telemonitoring features, supported by cloud-based storage and by a web application accessible from anywhere by medical personnel and patients, enable constant transparent monitoring of the rehabilitation progresses. The clinical trial of the DoMoMEA telerehabilitation system will involve 40 post-stroke patients with mild impairment and will start as soon as the restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic will allow to enroll patients.","Zedda, A; Gusai, E; Caruso, M; Bertuletti, S; Baldazzi, G; Spanu, S; Riboni, D; Pibiri, A; Monticone, M; Cereatti, A; Pani, D",Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

The SAP-E addresses the entire chain of care from primary prevention through to life after stroke. Within this document digital health tools are suggested for their potential to facilitate greater access to stroke care. In this review, we searched for digital health solutions for every domain of the SAP-E. RECENT FINDINGS Currently available digital health solutions for the cerebrovascular disease have been designed to support professionals and patients in healthcare settings at all stages. Telemedicine in acute settings has notably increased the access to tissue plasminogen activator and thrombectomy whereas in poststroke settings it has improved access to rehabilitation. Moreover, numerous applications aim to monitor vital signs and prescribed treatment adherence. SUMMARY SAP-E with its seven domains covers the whole continuum of stroke care, where digital health solutions have been considered to provide utility at a low cost. These technologies are progressively being used in all phases of stroke care, allowing them to overcome geographical and organizational barriers. The commercially available applications may also be used by patients and their careers in various context to facilitate accessibility to health improvement strategies.","Antonenko, Kateryna; Paciaroni, Maurizio; Sokolova, Larysa; Pezzella, Francesca R",Current opinion in neurology,https://doi.org/10.1097/wco.0000000000000891; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33278145/,495

In this IMR Dispatch, we argue that the impact of policies initially implemented to halt movement and curb the spread of the disease will nonetheless have medium- and longer term consequences for international migration. Specifically, we argue that these initial border restrictions have set in motion demographic and sociological processes that are likely to culminate in greater support for restricting future migration. Based on demographic evidence, we posit that after extended suppression of migration, OECD countries and Russia will see a migration spike, akin to a “baby boom” for fertility rebounds. Drawing on sociological theory and research, we hypothesize that these spikes in migration will increase anti-immigrant sentiment among native-born residents in destination countries and mobilize political support for reintroducing restrictive migration policies — triggering a feedback loop. In an effort to help facilitate future research and empirical tests of our model, we identify key concepts, processes, and data sources for the analysis of the pandemic’s impact on international migration over time.","O’Brien Michelle, L.; Eger, Maureen A.",The International Migration Review,https://doi.org/10.1177/0197918320968754,495

The current report is an analysis of the 5’UTRs from 48 sequences deposited in GenBank representing the seven described genotypes, five in Africa and two in the Americas. The YFV 5’UTRs consist of 118-120 nucleotides, 92% (110/119) of which are constant in all sequences. The constancy is impressive and suggests that many participate in significant viral functions. Remarkably, analysis of the non-constant nucleotides revealed that in some instances the non-constant nucleotide changes persisted in one or a restricted number of related genotypes and were from sequences isolated over a considerable span of years. This constant feature of non-constant nucleotides is consistent with the concept that the changes were in response to different environmental features such as changes in mosquito hosts or animal reservoirs, particularly as a consequence of spread of YFV from Africa to the New World. Constancy of 5’UTR in general may be helpful in distinction of viral species. Lastly, the presence of sequences of constant nucleotides greater than 19 nucleotides suggests regions of the 5’UTR that may be exploited for use as non-codon RNA as treatment and diagnostic agents in a variety of viral diseases. Importance The 5’UTR is arguably the most neglected portion of the viral genome. It is frequently incomplete in the sequences deposited as otherwise complete sequences in GenBank. The current report is an analysis of complete 5’UTR sequences selected from those deposited in GenBank and indicates that the 5’UTR is 92% conserved confirming that it is a highly conserved portion of the viral genome and suggesting that each conserved nucleotide may be functionally significant. Repeated occurrences of even non-constant nucleotides belong to a restricted number of genotypes raising the possibility that adaptation to new mosquito hosts and animal reservoirs such as those that accompanied spread of yellow fever virus from Africa to the Western Hemisphere are relevant. Knowledge of prolonged strings of invariable nucleotides in the 5’UTR has been used in designing a method for detecting YFV and may also be relevant for designing sequences for viral control of a variety of viruses.","Seligman, Stephen J.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.17.207902,495

The framework incorporates attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control and a very crucial construct, i.e. perceived risk, as per the current critical scenario of COVID-19. Design/methodology/approach - Data was collected using a survey instrument on the internet by posting the questionnaire link over social network web pages of online traveling websites. The data was analyzed using structural equations modeling with AMOS 22.0 and SPSS software, and the proposed hypotheses were statistically tested. The sample under consideration constitutes 417 responses. Findings - Empirical findings suggest that attitude, perceived behavioral control and perceived risk are significant for predicting behavioral intention while subjective norms do not. And these variables explained about 35 percent of the variance in behavioral intention of traveling in the period of coronavirus. Research limitations/implications - This study can benefit travelers, tourism and hospitality industry, governments, aviation industry and other relevant organizations as this paper offers the latest updates and essential information regarding traveler`s intention of traveling in the period of coronavirus. The study mainly focuses on India, so the generalizations of results to other countries are unwanted. Originality/value - The primary value of this paper is that it tested the theory of planned behavior by incorporating perceived risk in the context of COVID-19. To the best of authors' knowledge, in Indian context, there is no study which has tested the TPB by adding perceived risk in explaining the Indian citizens' behavioral intention of traveling in the period of Coronavirus.","Sujood, Hamid S.; Bano, N.",International Journal of Tourism Cities,https://doi.org/10.1108/ijtc-09-2020-0183,495

However, barriers to training availability and accessibility have left many life scientists under-prepared. To address these challenges, we developed a workshop series led by graduate students to cover topics relevant to research needs among life scientists. Our workshops incorporated guided practice to facilitate a student-centered learning environment. Further, in response to changes mandated by the COVID-19 pandemic, the workshop series was converted to a virtual format and extended to life science researchers beyond our home institution. We highlight how to effectively structure workshops to develop computational skills and adapt in-person activities to the virtual environment. Survey data shows our workshops reached a highly diverse group of scientists, representing more than eight departments, in both in-person and virtual renditions. Further, we demonstrate an increase in self-reported confidence in student abilities to apply concepts to their own research following content delivery. This increase was facilitated in both virtual and in-person environments, showing that adapting content for online delivery is capable of supporting student learning gains. The success of this workshop series shows the importance of hands-on, guided practice in developing computational skills to fill gaps in training in the agricultural and natural sciences.","LaTourrette, Katherine Stengel Ashley Clarke Jennifer",Natural Sciences Education,https://doi.org/10.1002/nse2.20052,495

Macromolecules adopt several favored conformations in solution depending on their structure and shape, determining their dynamics and function. Integrated methods combining the lowest-frequency movements obtained by Normal Mode Analysis (NMA), and the faster movements from Molecular Dynamics (MD), and data from biophysical techniques, are necessary to establish the correlation between complex structural dynamics of macromolecules and their function. In this article, we used a hybrid simulation method to sample the conformational space to characterize the structural dynamics and global motions of WT SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and 48 mutants, including several mutations that appear in P.1, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, B.1.525 and B.1.429+B.1.427 variants. Integrated Hybrid methods combining NMA and MD have been useful to study the correlation between the complex structural dynamics of macromolecules and their functioning mechanisms. Here, we applied this hybrid approach to elucidate the effects of mutation in the structural dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, considering their flexibility, solvent accessible surface area analyses, global movements, and catalytic dyad distance. Furthermore, some mutants showed significant changes in their structural dynamics and conformation, which could lead to distinct functional properties. Highlights Single surface mutations lead to changes in Mpro structural dynamics. Mutants can be more stable than WT according to the structural dynamics properties.

174011,Classifying chronic pain using multidimensional pain-agnostic symptom assessments and clustering analysis,2021-04-22,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had impactful and possibly long-term effects on the lives of college students. This may be particularly challenging for food insecure students, who are at a higher risk for negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of COVID-19 on the health behaviors and mental health of food insecure college students. A mixed-methods study design was used to determine the changes in mental and health behaviors in food insecure college students. Students completed 2 surveys over 6 months, pre and post COVID-19. Surveys were composed of validated measures and open-ended questions. Participants were asked to describe their demographics, food security, fruit and vegetable intake, stress, and life satisfaction. Food insecure students (n = 41) were recruited from Florida International University. Participants were female (92.5%), White Caucasian (42.5%), and Hispanic (60%), and of normal BMI (52.5%). Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS v26. Descriptive statistics, frequencies, and t tests were performed on validated measures. Diet and physical activity open response questions were categorized into positive, negative or neutral changes due to COVID-19. Overall changes went through a thematic review and were categorized into themes. Post COVID-19, participants significantly decreased their fruit and vegetable intake (t = -2.12, P = 0.04). Participants indicated both positive and negative changes in diet and physical activity. Participants also increased their perceived stress (t = 2.37, P = 0.02) and decreased life satisfaction (t = -3.03, P &lt; 0.01) but indicated positive changes including getting closer to family and friends, improved work, school, and finances, and had increased time to enjoy activities. COVID-19 had both positive and detrimental effects on diet, physical activity, stress and life satisfaction of food insecure students. While overall measures declined, students indicated that quarantine gave them an opportunity to work on personal relationships and mental health. None.

Animal models that faithfully recapitulate human disease are critical for assessing SARS-CoV-2 viral and immune dynamics, for understanding mechanisms of disease, and for testing vaccines and therapeutics. Pigtail macaques (PTM, Macaca nemestrina) demonstrate a rapid and severe disease course when infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), including the development of severe cardiovascular symptoms that are pertinent to COVID-19 manifestations in humans. We thus proposed this species may likewise exhibit severe COVID-19 disease upon infection with SARS-CoV-2. Here, we extensively studied a cohort of SARS-CoV-2-infected PTM euthanized either 6- or 21-days after respiratory viral challenge. We show that PTM demonstrate largely mild-to-moderate COVID-19 disease. Pulmonary infiltrates were dominated by T cells, including CD4+ T cells that upregulate CD8 and express cytotoxic molecules, as well as virus-targeting T cells that were predominantly CD4+. We also noted increases in inflammatory and coagulation markers in blood, pulmonary pathologic lesions, and the development of neutralizing antibodies. Together, our data demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection of PTM recapitulates important features of COVID-19 and reveals new immune and viral dynamics and thus may serve as a useful animal model for studying pathogenesis and testing vaccines and therapeutics.","Melton, Alexandra; Doyle-Meyers, Lara A; Blair, Robert V; Midkiff, Cecily; Melton, Hunter J; Russell-Lodrigue, Kasi; Aye, Pyone P; Schiro, Faith; Fahlberg, Marissa; Szeltner, Dawn; Spencer, Skye; Beddingfield, Brandon J; Goff, Kelly; Golden, Nadia; Penney, Toni; Picou, Breanna; Hensley, Krystle; Chandler, Kristin E; Plante, Jessica A; Plante, Kenneth S; Weaver, Scott C; Roy, Chad J; Hoxie, James A; Gao, Hongmei; Montefiori, David C; Mankowski, Joseph L; Bohm, Rudolf P; Rappaport, Jay; Maness, Nicholas J",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.28.458047,495
175234,Dengue and COVID-19: Double burden for Indonesia health system,2021,"The recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has required the adoption of precautionary health behaviours to reduce the risk of infection. This study examines adherence, as well as changes in adherence, to four key precautionary behaviours among Canadian adults: wearing face masks, social distancing, hand washing, and avoiding large crowds. Data are drawn from Series 3 and 4 of the nationally representative Canadian Perspectives Survey Series, administered by Statistics Canada in June and July 2020. We calculate overall adherence levels as well as changes over time. Logistic regression models estimate each behaviour as a function of demographic and socio-economic characteristics to identify adherence disparities across population segments. We find a nearly universal increase in precautionary behaviours from June to July in mask wearing (67.3 percent to 83.6 percent), social distancing (82.4 percent to 89.2 percent), and avoiding crowds (84.1 percent to 88.9 percent);no significant change occurred in the frequency of hand washing. We observe significant disparities in adherence to precautionary behaviours, especially for mask wearing, in June;female, older, immigrant, urban, and highly educated adults were significantly more likely to adhere to precautionary behaviours than male, younger, Canadian-born, rural, and low-educated adults. By July 2020, these disparities persisted or were slightly attenuated;women, however, had consistently higher adherence to all behaviours at both time points. These findings have substantial implications for policy and potential public health interventions.","Jehn, A.; Stackhouse, M.; Zajacova, A.",Canadian Public Policy-Analyse De Politiques,https://doi.org/10.3138/cpp.2020-138,495

Following encouraging clinical results of subunit vaccination and revaccination with Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), it has been suggested to combine BCG and subunit vaccines for increased efficacy. Current subunit vaccines are almost exclusively designed as BCG boosters. The goal of this study was to design a subunit vaccine that does not share antigens with BCG and explore the advantages of a BCG+subunit vaccine co-administration strategy, where the two vaccines do not cross-react. Eight protective antigens were selected to create a Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)-specific subunit vaccine, named H107. Whereas subunit vaccines with BCG-shared antigens displayed cross-reactivity to BCG in vivo in both mice and humans, H107 showed no cross-reactivity and did not inhibit BCG colonization in mice. Encouragingly, co-administering H107 with BCG (BCG+H107) led to increased adaptive immune responses against both H107 and BCG leading to improved BCG-mediated immunity. In contrast to subunit vaccines with BCG-shared antigens, ‘boosting’ BCG with H107 led to substantial expansion of clonal diversity in the T cell repertoire, and BCG+H107 co-administration conferred significantly increased Th17 responses and less differentiated CD4 T cells. CD4 T cells induced by BCG+H107 maintained functional superiority after Mtb infection, and BCG+H107 provided significantly increased long-term protection compared to both BCG and H107 alone, as well as, BCG co-administered with a subunit vaccine composed of antigens shared with BCG. Overall, we identify several advantages of combining an Mtb-specific subunit vaccine with BCG and introduce H107 as a BCG-complementing vaccine with distinctive value for co-administration with BCG.","Woodworth, Joshua S.; Clemmensen, Helena Strand; Battey, Hannah; Dijkman, Karin; Lindenstrøm, Thomas; Laureano, Raquel Salvador; Taplitz, Randy; Morgan, Jeffrey; Aagaard, Claus; Rosenkrands, Ida; Lindestam Arlehamn, Cecilia S.; Andersen, Peter; Mortensen, Rasmus",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.18.435784,495

The unpredictable outbreak of this disease and the pandemic situation are causing severe depression, anxiety and other mental as physical health related problems among the human beings. This deadly disease has put social, economic condition of the entire world into an enormous challenge. To combat against this disease, vaccination is essential as it will boost the immune system of human beings while being in the contact with the infected people. The vaccination process is thus necessary to confront the outbreak of COVID-19. The worldwide vaccination progress should be tracked to identify how fast the entire economic as well as social life will be stabilized. The monitor of the vaccination progress, a machine learning based Regressor model is approached in this study. This vaccination tracking process has been applied on the data starting from 14th December, 2020 to 24th April, 2021. A couple of ensemble based machine learning Regressor models such as Random Forest, Extra Trees, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost and Extreme Gradient Boosting are implemented and their predictive performance are compared. The comparative study reveals that the Extra trees Regressor outperforms with minimized mean absolute error (MAE) of 6.465 and root mean squared error (RMSE) of 8.127. The uniqueness of this study relies on assessing as well as predicting vaccination intake progress by utilizing automated process offered by machine learning techniques. The innovative idea of the method is that the vaccination process and their priority are considered in the paper. Among several existing machine learning approaches, the ensemble based learning paradigms are employed in this study so that improved prediction efficiency can be delivered.","Dutta, S.; Mukherjee, U.; Bandyopadhyay, S.

179239,Interventions designed to improve vaccination uptake: Scoping review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses - protocol (version 1),2021-08-22,"To control the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, CoronaVac (Sinovac), an inactivated vaccine, has been granted emergency use authorization by many countries. However, the underlying mechanisms of the inactivated COVID-19 vaccine-induced immune response remain unclear, and little is known about its features compared to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we implemented single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to profile longitudinally collected PBMCs (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) in six individuals immunized with CoronaVac and compared these to the profiles of COVID-19 infected patients from a Single Cell Consortium. Both inactivated vaccines and SARS-CoV-2 infection drove changes in immune cell type proportions, caused B cell activation and differentiation, and induced the expression of genes associated with antibody production in the plasma. The inactivated vaccine and SARS-COV-2 infection also caused alterations in peripheral immune activity such as interferon response, inflammatory cytokine expression, innate immune cell apoptosis and migration, effector T cell exhaustion and cytotoxicity, however, the magnitude of change was greater in COVID-19 patients, especially those with severe disease, than in immunized individuals. Further analyses revealed a distinct peripheral immune cell phenotype associated with CoronaVac immunization (HLA class II upregulation and IL21R upregulation in naive B cells) versus SARS-CoV-2 infection (HLA class II downregulation and IL21R downregulation in naive B cells severe disease). There were also differences in the expression of important genes associated with proinflammatory cytokines and thrombosis. In conclusion, this study provides a single-cell atlas of the systemic immune response to CoronaVac immunization and reveals distinct immune responses between inactivated vaccines and SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Wang, Y.; Wang, X.; Luu, L.

The Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) proposed a reporting language for CT findings related to COVID-19 and defined four CT categories: typical, indeterminate, atypical, and negative. Objectives: To retrospectively evaluate the chest CT characteristics of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Patients and Methods: A total of 115 hospitalized laboratory-verified COVID-19 cases, underdoing chest CT scan, were included in this study from April 30 to May 15, 2020. Of 115 cases, 53 were discharged from the hospital, and 62 expired. The initial clinical features and chest CT scans were assessed for the type, pattern, distribution, and frequency of lesions. Moreover, the findings were compared between ward-hospitalized, ICU-admitted, and non-surviving (expired) patients. Results: Of four CT categories, typical CT findings for COVID-19 were more frequent in the expired group (77.4%), compared to the ward-admitted (44.8%) and ICU-admitted (70.8%) groups (P = 0.017). However, no significant difference was observed in the prevalence of intermediate or atypical CT findings between the groups. Negative CT scans for the diagnosis of COVID-19 were significantly fewer in the expired group (0%) as compared to the ward-admitted (10.3%) and ICU-admitted (8.3%) groups (P = 0.0180). Also, the mean number of involved lung lobes and segments was significantly higher in the expired group compared to the other two groups (P = 0.032 and 0.010, respectively). The right upper lobe involvement, right middle lobe involvement, bilateral involvement, central lesion, air bronchogram, and pleural effusion were among CT scan findings with a significantly higher prevalence in non-surviving cases (P &lt; 0.0001, 0.047, 0.01, 0.036, 0.038, and 0.047, respectively). Conclusion: The increased number of involved lung lobes and segments, bilateral and central distribution patterns, air bronchogram, and severe pleural effusion in the initial chest CT scan can be related to the increased severity and poor prognosis of COVID-19.","Besharat, S.; Rahimi, F.; Afaghi, S.; Tarki, F.

PBDEs may act as risk factors for autism spectrum disorders (ASD), characterized by abnormal psychosocial functioning, although direct evidence is currently lacking. Using a translational exposure model, we tested the hypothesis that maternal transfer of a commercial mixture of PBDEs, DE-71, produces ASD-relevant behavioral and neurochemical deficits in female offspring. C57Bl6/N mouse dams (F0) were exposed to DE-71 via oral administration of 0 (VEH/CON), 0.1 (L-DE-71) or 0.4 (H-DE-71) mg/kg bw/d from 3 wk prior to gestation through lactation. Mass spectrometry analysis indicated in utero and lactational transfer of PBDEs (ppb) to F1 female offspring brain tissue at postnatal day (PND) 15 which was reduced by PND 110. Neurobehavioral testing of social novelty preference (SNP) and social recognition memory (SRM) revealed that adult L-DE-71 F1 offspring display altered short- and long-term SRM, in the absence of reduced sociability, and increased repetitive behavior. These effects were concomitant with reduced olfactory discrimination of social odors. Additionally, L-DE-71 exposure also altered short-term novel object recognition memory but not anxiety or depressive-like behavior. Moreover, F1 L-DE-71 displayed downregulated mRNA transcripts for oxytocin (Oxt) in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and supraoptic nucleus, vasopressin (Avp) in the BNST and upregulated Avp1ar in BNST, and Oxtr in the paraventricular nucleus. Our work demonstrates that developmental PBDE exposure produces ASD-relevant neurochemical, olfactory processing and behavioral phenotypes that may result from early neurodevelopmental reprogramming within central social and memory networks.","Kozlova, Elena V.; Valdez, Matthew C.; Denys, Maximillian E.; Bishay, Anthony E.; Krum, Julia M.; Rabbani, Kayhon M.; Carrillo, Valeria; Gonzalez, Gwendolyn M.; Lampel, Gregory; Tran, Jasmin D.; Vazquez, Brigitte M.; Anchondo, Laura M.; Uddin, Syed A.; Huffman, Nicole M.; Monarrez, Eduardo; Olomi, Duraan S.; Chinthirla, Bhuvaneswari D.; Hartman, Richard E.; Rao Kodavanti, Prasada S.; Chompre, Gladys; Phillips, Allison L.; Stapleton, Heather M.; Henkelmann, Bernhard; Schramm, Karl-Werner; Curras-Collazo, Margarita C.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.08.451690,495

Instead, I will argue that those who end up following the SHO, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, can rationalize following the SHO by learning from the Benedictine vow of stability. First, stability in a physical space reimagined as a kind of retreat from society might be beneficial for rejuvenating oneself and pursuing what one values. Second, stability negatively discourages people from escaping a difficult reality and positively encourages them to overcome challenges in the institutions in which they belong.

Serologic data were analyzed for annual variation in seroconversions to assess whether these pathogens are epidemic or endemic in cougars, and to determine whether family membership, age, sex, or location influence risk of exposure. FIV and FPV were clearly endemic in the studied populations, whereas exposure to FCoV, FCV, CDV, and Y. pestis was more sporadic. No evidence was found for FHV. Age was the most consistent predictor of increased exposure risk, often with no other important factors emerging. Evidence for transmission within family groups was limited to FIV and FCoV, whereas some indication for host sex affecting exposure probability was found for FIV and Y. pestis. Overall, cougar populations exhibited few differences in terms of pathogen presence and prevalence, suggesting the presence of similar risk factors throughout the study region.","Biek, Roman; Ruth, Toni K; Murphy, Kerry M; Anderson, Charles R; Johnson, Mark; DeSimone, Richard; Gray, Rachel; Hornocker, Maurice G; Gillin, Colin M; Poss, Mary",Journal of wildlife diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17092891/,495

The effect of this therapy on circulating tumor cells (CTCs) is unknown. As far as we are aware of, this is the first study to evaluate the effects of RFA on CTCs in patients with malignant lung tumors immediately post-treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS Nine patients with primary or metastatic lung tumors underwent RFA therapy from June to November 2013. Blood samples were taken before and after RFA, and filtered through the ScreenCell CTC capture device. RESULTS A general increase in CTCs in 7 out of the 9 cases was found, the largest increases were seen in the metastatic group. CONCLUSION This study demonstrates that the manipulation and ablative procedure of lung tumors leads to immediate dissemination of tumor cells, the effects of which are unknown and require further investigation.","Chudasama, Dimple; Rice, Alexandra; Anikin, Vladimir; Soppa, Gopal; Dalal, Paras",Anticancer research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25964562/,495

During 3 investigations carried out in 3 week intervals salmonella-positive animals were separated immediately from the stock. At the first examination 3 of 52, and at the second 2 of 49 samples were found to be salmonella-positive. At the third series all of the remaining 47 animals proved to be salmonella-negative. All isolates were identified as S. infantis. Feeding of contaminated, dried prawns was suspected as the most probable source of infection. A simultaneous examination of 96 of the stool specimens revealed Y. enterocolitica in 4 samples. Additionally, electron-microscopy of pooled fecal samples (3 to 4 animals each) led to demonstration of corona-, adenovirus and small round virus-like particles in one pool each.

Here we explore the use of dynamic bipartite graphs to model the physical contact patterns that result from movements of individuals between specific locations. The graphs are generated by large-scale individual-based urban traffic simulations built on actual census, land-use and population-mobility data. We find that the contact network among people is a strongly connected small-world-like graph with a well-defined scale for the degree distribution. However, the locations graph is scale-free, which allows highly efficient outbreak detection by placing sensors in the hubs of the locations network. Within this large-scale simulation framework, we then analyse the relative merits of several proposed mitigation strategies for smallpox spread. Our results suggest that outbreaks can be contained by a strategy of targeted vaccination combined with early detection without resorting to mass vaccination of a population.","Eubank, Stephen; Guclu, Hasan; Kumar, V S Anil; Marathe, Madhav V; Srinivasan, Aravind; Toroczkai, Zoltán; Wang, Nan",Nature,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15141212/,495

We find that the worldwide air transportation network is a scale-free small-world network. In contrast to the prediction of scale-free network models, however, we find that the most connected cities are not necessarily the most central, resulting in anomalous values of the centrality. We demonstrate that these anomalies arise because of the multicommunity structure of the network. We identify the communities in the air transportation network and show that the community structure cannot be explained solely based on geographical constraints and that geopolitical considerations have to be taken into account. We identify each city's global role based on its pattern of intercommunity and intracommunity connections, which enables us to obtain scale-specific representations of the network.","Guimerà, R; Mossa, S; Turtschi, A; Amaral, L A N",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15911778/,495

To test whether abrogation of this H-2Db-restricted epitope, located within the spike glycoprotein at residues S510 to 518 (S510), resulted in delayed virus clearance and/or virus persistence we selected isogenic recombinants which express either the wild-type JHM spike protein (RJHM) or spike containing the N514S mutation (RJHM(N514S)), which abrogates the response to S510. In contrast to observations in suckling mice in which viruses encoding inactivating mutations within the S510 epitope (epitope escape mutants) were associated with persistent virus and increased neurovirulence (Pewe et al., J Virol. 72:5912-5918, 1998), RJHM(N514S) was not more virulent than the parental, RJHM, in 4-week-old C57BL/6 (H-2b) mice after intracranial injection. Recombinant viruses expressing the JHM spike, wild type or encoding the N514S substitution, were also selected in which background genes were derived from the neuroattenuated A59 strain of MHV. Whereas recombinants expressing the wild-type JHM spike (SJHM/RA59) were highly neurovirulent, A59 recombinants containing the N514S mutation (SJHM(N514S)/RA59) were attenuated, replicated less efficiently, and exhibited reduced virus spread in the brain at 5 days postinfection (peak of infectious virus titers in the central nervous system) compared to parental virus encoding wild-type spike. Virulence assays in BALB/c mice (H-2d), which do not recognize the S510 epitope, revealed that attenuation of the epitope escape mutants was not due to the loss of a pathogenic immune response directed against the S510 epitope. Thus, an intact immunodominant S510 epitope is not essential for virus clearance from the CNS, the S510 inactivating mutation results in decreased virulence in weanling mice but not in suckling mice, suggesting that specific host conditions are required for epitope escape mutants to display increased virulence, and the N514S mutation causes increased attenuation in the context of A59 background genes, demonstrating that genes other than that for the spike are also important in determining neurovirulence.","MacNamara, Katherine C; Chua, Ming Ming; Phillips, Joanna J; Weiss, Susan R",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15994805/,495
197980,COVID 19: Diabetes and Obesity API-ICP Recommendations.,2020-05-01,"Murine coronavirus MHV-A59 normally infects only murine cells in vitro and causes transmissible infection only in mice. In the 17 C1 1 line of murine cells, the receptor for MHV-A59 is MHVR, a biliary glycoprotein in the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family of glycoproteins. We found that virus released from the 600th passage of 17 C1 1 cells persistently infected with MHV-A59 (MHV/pi600) replicated in hamster (BHK-21) cells. The virus was passaged and plaque-purified in BHK-21 cells, yielding the MHV/BHK strain. Because murine cells persistently infected with MHV-A59 express a markedly reduced level of MHVR (Sawicki, et al., 1995), we tested whether virus with altered receptor interactions was selected in the persistently infected culture. Infection of 17 C1 1 cells by MHV-A59 can be blocked by treating the cells with anti-MHVR MAb-CC1, while infection by MHV/BHK was only partially blocked by MAb-CC1. MHV/BHK virus was also more resistant than wild-type MHV-A59 to neutralization by purified, recombinant, soluble MHVR glycoprotein (sMHVR). Cells in the persistently infected culture may also express reduced levels of and have altered interactions with some of the Bgp-related glycoproteins that can serve as alternative receptors for MHV-A59. Unlike the parental MHV-A59 which only infects murine cells, MHV/BHK virus was able to infect cell lines derived from mice, hamsters, rats, cats, cows, monkeys and humans. However, MHV/BHK was not able to infect all mammalian species, because a pig (ST) cell line and a dog cell line (MDCK I) were not susceptible to infection. MHV/pi600 and MHV/BHK replicated in murine cells more slowly than MHV-A59 and formed smaller plaques. Thus, in the persistently infected murine cells which expressed a markedly reduced level of MHVR, virus variants were selected that have altered interactions with MHVR and an extended host range. In vivo, in mice infected with coronavirus, virus variants with altered receptor recognition and extended host range might be selected in tissues that have low levels of receptors. Depending upon the tissue in which such a virus variant was selected, it might be shed from the infected animal or eaten by a predator, thus presenting a possible means for initiating the transition of a variant virus into a new host as a model for an emerging virus disease.","Schickli, J H; Wentworth, D E; Zelus, B D; Holmes, K V; Sawicki, S G",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9782352/,495

However, a few tick species transmit several (e.g. Ixodes ricinus, Amblyomma variegatum) or many (I. uriae) tick-borne viruses. Tick-borne viruses are found in six different virus families (Asfarviridae, Reoviridae, Rhabdoviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Bunyaviridae, Flaviviridae) and at least 9 genera. Some as yet unassigned tick-borne viruses may belong to a seventh family, the Arenaviridae. With only one exception (African swine fever virus, family Asfarviridae) all tick-borne viruses (as well as all other arboviruses) are RNA viruses. Tick-borne viruses are found in all the RNA virus families in which insect-borne members are found, with the exception of the family Togaviridae. Some tick-borne viruses pose a significant threat to the health of humans (Tick-borne encephalitis virus, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus) or livestock (African swine fever virus, Nairobi sheep disease virus). Key challenges are to determine the molecular adaptations that allow tick-borne viruses to infect and replicate in both tick and vertebrate cells, and to identify the principal ecological determinants of tick-borne virus survival.","Labuda, M; Nuttall, P A",Parasitology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15938513/,495

Currently, many drug discovery approaches follow the typical protein structure-function paradigm, designing drugs to bind to fixed three-dimensional structures. However, in recent years such approaches have failed to address drug resistance and limit the set of possible drug targets and candidates. For these reasons we instead focus on targeting protein regions that lack a stable structure, known as intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). Such regions are essential to numerous biological pathways that contribute to the virulence of various viruses. In this work, we discover eleven new SARS-CoV-2 drug candidates targeting IDRs and provide further evidence for the involvement of IDRs in viral processes such as enzymatic peptide cleavage while demonstrating the efficacy of our unique docking approach.","Mudide, Anish; Alterovitz, Gil",Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing.

BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by coronavirusis emerged as the major healthcare challenge globally. The mainstay approach to limit this virus spread is an early and accurate diagnosis of the viral infection and appropriate quarantine of patients with coronavirus infection. RESULTS: Real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) offers a quick detection of the disease in either symptomatic or asymptomatic patients. In literature, there are numerous studies that underline the importance of CT as the first-step diagnostic tool in COVID-19 diagnosis. Even in asymptomatic patients, COVID-19 pneumonia may manifest with chest CT imaging abnormalities.

AIM: To describe characteristics of patients who died and the care they received, and to examine how patient characteristics, setting and visiting restrictions are related to provided care and evaluation of the dying process. DESIGN: An open observational online survey among healthcare professionals about their experience of end-of-life care that was provided to a patient with or without COVID-19 who died between March and July 2020. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Healthcare professionals (nurses, physicians and others) in the Netherlands from all settings: home (n = 163), hospital (n = 249), nursing home (n = 192), hospice (n = 89) or elsewhere (n = 68). RESULTS: Of patients reported on, 56% had COVID-19. Among these patients, 358 (84.4%) also had a serious chronic illness. Having COVID-19 was negatively, and having a serious chronic illness was positively associated with healthcare staff's favourable appreciation of end-of-life care. Often there had been visiting restrictions in the last 2 days of life (75.8%). This was negatively associated with appreciation of care at the end of life and the dying process. Finally, care at the end of life was less favourably appreciated in hospitals and especially nursing homes, and more favourably in home settings and especially hospices.

We developed a framework to assess various populations with unstable housing in terms of socio-economic consequences of COVID-19, risk of COVID-19 infection and progression, existing/urgent measures, and remaining challenges. Within the framework, nine groups vulnerable to homelessness in Japan were classified into (i) ""people without accommodation,"" (ii) ""people living in temporary or crisis accommodation,"" and (iii) populations that include ""people living in severely inadequate and insecure accommodation."" The assessment revealed that ""staying at home"" was physically and practically unattainable across groups. The study identified specific institutional, social, and cultural challenges apart from the common economic crisis, whereas the utilization of social welfare was low. Findings suggest that the rapid increase of groups classified as ""(i)"" and ""(ii)"" should be addressed by engaging stakeholders to enhance the availability and accessibility of social welfare and rescue measures, and to ensure safe and private accommodations for all groups. It is critical to enhance multi-sectoral collaboration in responding to the common and specific vulnerabilities of these population groups from health, socio-economic, and humanitarian perspectives. Under the pandemic, homelessness should be regarded less as a peculiar problem for specific populations but an extension of daily life. The framework can be a reference when planning the comprehensive yet concise assessment of populations with unstable housing in other countries to inform responses to the pandemic.","Fujita, Masami; Matsuoka, Sadatoshi; Kiyohara, Hiroyuki; Kumakura, Yousuke; Takeda, Yuko; Goishi, Norimichi; Tarui, Masayoshi; Inaba, Masaki; Nagai, Mari; Hachiya, Masahiko; Fujita, Noriko",Trop Med Health,,495

According to the results of multivariable regression adjusted for potential confounders, elevated BMI (OR = 2.49; 95% CI = 1.15-5.41), higher CRP levels (OR = 2.28; 95% CI = 1.08-4.78), increased FBS levels (OR = 2.88; 95% CI = 1.35-6.17), higher levels of total cholestrol (OR = 2.55; 95% CI = 1.19-5.45) and LDL (OR = 2.27; 95% CI = 1.07-4.79), elevated triglyceride (OR = 5.14; 95% CI = 2.28-11.56), and raised levels of D-dimer (OR = 5.68; 95% CI = 2.22-14.49) were identified as independent risk factors of COVID-19 mortality. No significant association was detected regarding HDL level, QTc interval or heart size, and COVID-19 fatality odds. CONCLUSION: The present findings demonstrated that obesity, higher levels of CRP, blood sugar, D-dimer, and lipid markers were likely to be predictive factors of COVID-19-related mortality odds.","Salari, Arsalan; Mahdavi-Roshan, Marjan; Ghorbani, Zeinab; Mortazavi, Seyede Sahere; Naghshbandi, Mona; Faraghnia, Farsima; Rahbar Taramsari, Morteza; Ahmadnia, Zahra",Ir. j. med. sci,,495

Methodology/results: di-18:1 BMP was extracted by liquid-liquid extraction using n-butanol and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. The qualified method was selective, precise, robust and accurate across the linearity range (0.2-250 ng/ml). Qualified method was then used to assess chloroquine-induced phospholipidosis in rats dosed at 120 mg/kg for 5 days. A fivefold increase in di-18:1 BMP was observed on Day 5 compared with predose. Conclusion: Di-18:1 BMP can be used as a noninvasive biomarker to assess/screen compounds that could cause drug-induced phospholipidosis in rats.","Murali, Bokka Venkata; Kurawattimath, Vishwanath; Bhutani, Priyadeep; Onorato, Joelle; Naikodi, Sangmesh B; Kole, Prashant; Rajanna, Prabhakar K",Bioanal.

This study aimed to investigate the effect of selected disinfection products and methods on the inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 in the laboratory. We used quantitative suspension testing to evaluate the effectiveness of the disinfectant/method. Available chlorine of 250 mg/L, 500 mg/L, and 1000 mg/L required 20 min, 5 min, and 0.5 min to inactivate SARS-CoV-2, respectively. A 600-fold dilution of 17% concentration of di-N-decyl dimethyl ammonium bromide (283 mg/L) and the same concentration of di-N-decyl dimethyl ammonium chloride required only 0.5 min to inactivate the virus efficiently. At 30% concentration for 1 min and 40% and above for 0.5 min, ethanol could efficiently inactivate SARS-CoV-2. Heat takes approximately 30 min at 56 °C, 10 min above 70 °C, or 5 min above 90 °C to inactivate the virus. The chlorinated disinfectants, Di-N-decyl dimethyl ammonium bromide/chloride, ethanol, and heat could effectively inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in the laboratory test.

However, that is rarely feasible due to the constraints imposed by standardized measures of reading ability which require test administration by trained clinicians or researchers. Here we explore whether a simple, two-alternative forced choice, time limited lexical decision task (LDT), self-delivered through the web-browser, can serve as an accurate and reliable measure of reading ability. We found that performance on the LDT is highly correlated with scores on standardized measures of reading ability such as the Woodcock-Johnson Letter Word Identification test (r = 0.91, disattenuated r = 0.94). Importantly, the LDT reading ability measure is highly reliable (r = 0.97). After optimizing the list of words and pseudowords based on item response theory, we found that a short experiment with 76 trials (2-3 min) provides a reliable (r = 0.95) measure of reading ability.

Oncology social workers (OSWs) are essential providers of psychosocial support to parents with advanced cancer. Yet, little is known about the experiences and approaches of OSWs in addressing these patients' unique needs. The purpose of this study was to characterize the attitudes, practice behaviors, and training experiences of OSWs who provide psychosocial care for advanced cancer patients with minor children. METHOD: Forty-one OSWs participated in a cross-sectional survey addressing multiple facets of their psychosocial care for parents with advanced cancer. The five assessed domains of psychosocial support were communication support, emotional support, household support, illness and treatment decision-making support, and end-of-life planning. RESULTS: Participants reported greatest confidence in counseling patients on communication with children about illness and providing support to co-parents about parenting concerns. OSWs reported less confidence in counseling parents on end-of-life issues and assisting families with non-traditional household structures. The majority of participants reported needing more time in their clinical practice to sufficiently address parents' psychosocial needs. Nearly 90% of participants were interested in receiving further training on the care of parents with advanced cancer. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: To improve the care of parents with advanced cancer, it is critical to understand how the psychosocial oncology workforce perceives its clinical practice needs. Study findings suggest an opportunity for enhanced training, particularly with respect to end-of-life needs and in response to the changing household structure of American families.","Quillen, Laura J; Borstelmann, Nancy A; Stanton, Kate E; Nelson, Courtney A; Chien, Stephanie A; Bowers, Savannah M; Swift, Catherine L; Gonzalez, Yulissa; Yi, Samantha M; Park, Eliza M",Palliat Support Care,,495

METHODS: Participants (n=3207, aged 2-90 years), enrolled from a previously established nationwide serosurveillance study, provided a self-collected fingerstick blood sample and completed a questionnaire (median inclusion date 3 April 2020). IgG antibodies targeted against the spike S1-protein of SARS-CoV-2 were quantified using a validated multiplex-immunoassay. Seroprevalence was estimated controlling for survey design, individual pre-pandemic concentration, and test performance. Random-effects logistic regression identified risk factors for seropositivity. RESULTS: Overall seroprevalence in the Netherlands was 2.8% (95% CI 2.1 to 3.7), with no differences between sexes or ethnic background, and regionally ranging between 1.3 and 4.0%. Estimates were highest among 18-39 year-olds (4.9%), and lowest in children 2-17 years (1.7%). Multivariable analysis revealed that persons taking immunosuppressants and those from the Orthodox-Reformed Protestant community had over four times higher odds of being seropositive compared to others. Anosmia/ageusia was the most discriminative symptom between seropositive (53%) and seronegative persons (4%, p<0.0001). Antibody concentrations in seropositive persons were significantly higher in those with fever or dyspnoea in contrast to those without (p=0.01 and p=0.04, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In the midst of the first epidemic wave, 2.8% of the Dutch population was estimated to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, that is, 30 times higher than reported. This study identified independent groups with increased odds for seropositivity that may require specific surveillance measures to guide future protective interventions internationally, including vaccination once available.","Vos, Eric R A; den Hartog, Gerco; Schepp, Rutger M; Kaaijk, Patricia; van Vliet, Jeffrey; Helm, Kina; Smits, Gaby; Wijmenga-Monsuur, Alienke; Verberk, Janneke D M; van Boven, Michiel; van Binnendijk, Rob S; de Melker, Hester E; Mollema, Liesbeth; van der Klis, Fiona R M",J. epidemiol. community health (1979),,495

221425,COVID-19 in pregnancy and the puerperium: A review for emergency physicians,2020,"Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) are RNA sensor molecules that play essential roles in innate antiviral immunity. Among the three RLRs encoded by the human genome, RIG-I and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5, which contain N-terminal caspase recruitment domains, are activated upon the detection of viral RNAs in the cytoplasm of virus-infected cells. Activated RLRs induce downstream signaling via their interactions with mitochondrial antiviral signaling proteins and activate the production of type I and III interferons and inflammatory cytokines. Recent studies have shown that RLR-mediated signaling is regulated by interactions with endogenous RNAs and host proteins, such as those involved in stress responses and posttranslational modifications. Since RLR-mediated cytokine production is also involved in the regulation of acquired immunity, the deregulation of RLR-mediated signaling is associated with autoimmune and autoinflammatory disorders. Moreover, RLR-mediated signaling might be involved in the aberrant cytokine production observed in coronavirus disease 2019. Since the discovery of RLRs in 2004, significant progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms underlying the activation and regulation of RLR-mediated signaling pathways. Here, we review the recent advances in the understanding of regulated RNA recognition and signal activation by RLRs, focusing on the interactions between various host and viral factors.","Onomoto, Koji; Onoguchi, Kazuhide; Yoneyama, Mitsutoshi",Cell. mol. immunol.

While many surveys have been conducted, most are focused on drinking changes in the general population and validation with biological markers is lacking. METHOD: We performed a retrospective cohort study among patients with AUD attending a urine drug screening program. With mixed-effects logistic regression models, we assessed the probability of screening positive for ethyl glucuronide according to patients' main clinical characteristics and time of analysis (either prior to or after a lockdown was implemented in Spain). RESULTS: A total of 362 patients provided 2,040 urine samples (1,295 prior to lockdown, 745 during lockdown). The mean age of participants was 52.0 years (SD 12.6), and 69.2% were men. Of the 43% of patients tested for other drugs 22% screened positive. After adjusting for all covariates, the odds of screening positive for ethyl glucuronide during lockdown almost doubled (OR = 1.99, 95% CI 1.20 to 3.33, p = 0.008). Other significant covariates included testing positive for other drugs (OR = 10.79, 95% CI 4.60 to 26.97) and length of treatment (OR = 0.59, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.74). CONCLUSIONS: Our data support an association between the lockdown due to COVID-19 and increased alcohol use in patients with AUD. Thus, addiction healthcare systems could face significant challenges ahead. In light of these findings, it is essential to evaluate prospectively how patients with AUD are affected by the pandemic and how health systems respond to their needs.","Barrio, Pablo; Baldaquí, Nuria; Andreu, Magalí; Kilian, Carolin; Rehm, Jürgen; Gual, Antoni; Manthey, Jakob",Alcohol Clin Exp Res,,495

RESULTS: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, 208 out of 736 patients (28.9 per cent) admitted to our institution with SARS-CoV-2 were referred for swallow assessment. Of the 208 patients, 102 were admitted to the intensive treatment unit for mechanical ventilation support, of which 82 were tracheostomised. The majority of patients regained near normal swallow function prior to discharge, regardless of intubation duration or tracheostomy status.

As the data changes, the y-axis may need to be rescaled as the domain of the data changes. Each axis rescaling potentially improves the readability of the current chart, but may also disorient the user. In contrast to static visualizations, where there is considerable literature to help choose the appropriate y-axis scale, there is a lack of guidance about how and when rescaling should be used in dynamic visualizations. Existing visualization systems and libraries adapt a fixed global y-axis, or rescale every time the data changes. Yet, professional visualizations, such as in data journalism, do not adopt either strategy. They instead carefully and manually choose when to rescale based on the analysis task and data. To this end, we conduct a series of Mechanical Turk experiments to study the potential of dynamic axis rescaling and the factors that affect its effectiveness. We find that the appropriate rescaling policy is both task- and data-dependent, and we do not find one clear policy choice for all situations.","Fisher, Jacob; Chang, Remco; Wu, Eugene",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.09618v1.pdf,495
235189,Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Pediatric Emergency Department Utilization for Asthma,2020,"We study the impact of endogenous longevity on optimal tax progressivity and inequality in an overlapping generations model with skill heterogeneity. Higher tax progressivity decreases both the longevity gap and net income inequality, but at the expense of lower average lifetime and income. We find that the welfare-maximizing income tax is less progressive in our model with endogenous longevity than in our model with exogenous longevity. In a highly stylized calibration of the US economy, we show that optimal tax progressivity is less than what prevails under the current US tax system. Our results are robust to the range of empirical labor supply elasticity and the assumptions of missing annuity markets and stochastic health. Our conclusion for the optimal progressivity of the US tax system can be altered by the adoption of a more egalitarian welfare function or by increases in prevailing levels of wage inequality.","Heer, Burkhard; Rohrbacher, Stefan",J Health Econ,,495
235190,Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Pediatric Emergency Department Utilization for Asthma,2020,"We developed and applied a computational approach to simulate functional effects of the global circulating mutation D614G of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations are combined with deep mutational scanning and analysis of the residue interaction networks to investigate conformational landscapes and energetics of the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins in different functional states of the D614G mutant. The results of conformational dynamics and analysis of collective motions demonstrated that the D614 site plays a key regulatory role in governing functional transitions between open and closed states. Using mutational scanning and sensitivity analysis of protein residues, we identified the stability hotspots in the SARS-CoV-2 spike structures of the mutant trimers. The results suggest that the D614G mutation can induce the increased stability of the open form acting as a driver of conformational changes, which may result in the increased exposure to the host receptor and promote infectivity of the virus. The network community analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins showed that the D614G mutation can enhance long-range couplings between domains and strengthen the interdomain interactions in the open form, supporting the reduced shedding mechanism. This study provides the landscape-based perspective and atomistic view of the allosteric interactions and stability hotspots in the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, offering a useful insight into the molecular mechanisms underpinning functional effects of the global circulating mutations.","Verkhivker, G.

METHODS: In this retrospective cross-sectional study, 2988 (82%) of 3620 healthcare workers in a university hospital participated. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) antibody was investigated using serum from healthcare workers who underwent COVID-19 antibody testing. The antibody test results of the participants were evaluated based on their work campus, their profession and their workplace. The statistical significance level was p < 0.05 in all analyses. RESULTS: Of the participants in this study, 108 (3.6%) were antibody positive, and 2880 (96.4%) were negative. Antibody positivity rates were greater in nurses compared with other healthcare workers (p < 0.001). Regarding workplace, antibody positivity was greater in those working in intensive care compared to those working in other locations (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare workers are at the highest risk of being infected with COVID-19. Those who have a higher risk of infection among healthcare workers and those working in high-risk areas should be vaccinated early and use personal protective equipment during the pandemic.

The model is based upon ensemble or population dynamics that generate outcomes, like new cases and deaths over time. The purpose of this model is to quantify the uncertainty that attends predictions of relevant outcomes. By assuming suitable conditional dependencies, one can model the effects of interventions (e.g., social distancing) and differences among populations (e.g., herd immunity) to predict what might happen in different circumstances. Technically, this model leverages state-of-the-art variational (Bayesian) model inversion and comparison procedures, originally developed to characterise the responses of neuronal ensembles to perturbations. Here, this modelling is applied to epidemiological populations-to illustrate the kind of inferences that are supported and how the model per se can be optimised given timeseries data. Although the purpose of this paper is to describe a modelling protocol, the results illustrate some interesting perspectives on the current pandemic; for example, the nonlinear effects of herd immunity that speak to a self-organised mitigation process.","Friston, Karl J; Parr, Thomas; Zeidman, Peter; Razi, Adeel; Flandin, Guillaume; Daunizeau, Jean; Hulme, Ollie J; Billig, Alexander J; Litvak, Vladimir; Moran, Rosalyn J; Price, Cathy J; Lambert, Christian",Wellcome Open Res,,495

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all COVID-19 patients diagnosed with UGB in 62 Spanish EDs (20% of Spanish EDs, case group) during the first 2 months of the COVID-19 outbreak. We formed 2 control groups: COVID-19 patients without UGB (control group A) and non-COVID-19 patients with UGB (control group B). Fifty-three independent variables and 4 outcomes were compared between cases and controls. RESULTS: We identified 83 UGB in 74,814 patients with COVID-19 who were attending EDs (1.11%, 95% CI=0.88-1.38). This incidence was lower compared with non-COVID-19 patients [2474/1,388,879, 1.78%, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.71-1.85; odds ratio (OR)=0.62; 95% CI=0.50-0.77]. Clinical characteristics associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 patients presenting with UGB were abdominal pain, vomiting, hematemesis, dyspnea, expectoration, melena, fever, cough, chest pain, and dysgeusia. Compared with non-COVID-19 patients with UGB, COVID-19 patients with UGB more frequently had fever, cough, expectoration, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, interstitial lung infiltrates, and ground-glass lung opacities. They underwent fewer endoscopies in the ED (although diagnoses did not differ between cases and control group B) and less endoscopic treatment. After adjustment for age and sex, cases showed a higher in-hospital all-cause mortality than control group B (OR=2.05, 95% CI=1.09-3.86) but not control group A (OR=1.14, 95% CI=0.59-2.19) patients. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of UGB in COVID-19 patients attending EDs was lower compared with non-COVID-19 patients. Digestive symptoms predominated over respiratory symptoms, and COVID-19 patients with UGB underwent fewer gastroscopies and endoscopic treatments than the general population with UGB. In-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients with UGB was increased compared with non-COVID patients with UGB, but not compared with the remaining COVID-19 patients.","González González, Rebeca; Jacob, Javier; Miró, Òscar; Llorens, Pere; Jiménez, Sònia; González Del Castillo, Juan; Burillo-Putze, Guillermo; Martín, Alfonso; Martín-Sánchez, Francisco J; Lamberechts, Jorge G; Alquézar-Arbé, Aitor; Higa-Sansone, Leopoldo; Gayoso Martín, Sara; Carbajosa, Virginia; Beddar Chaib, Fahd; Salido, Manuel; Marchena González, María J; Calvo López, Ricardo; González Martínez, Félix; Pavón Monzo, José; Velarde Herrera, Desiré M; Niembro Valdés, Ana P; Quero Motto, Eva; Ferreras Amez, José M; Piñera-Salmerón, Pascual",J. clin. gastroenterol,,495
239475,Quality and methodology of clinical practice guidelines on antiviral pharmacotherapy for COVID­19 during the early phase of the pandemic,2021,"One of the difficulties in monitoring an ongoing pandemic is deciding on the metric that best describes its status when multiple highly inter-correlated measurements are available. Having a single measure, such as whether the effective reproduction number R, has been useful in tracking whether the epidemic is on the incline or the decline and for imposing policy interventions to curb the increase. We propose an additional metric for tracking the UK epidemic across all four nations, that can capture the different spatial scales. This paper illustrates how to derive the principal scores from a weighted Principal Component Analysis using publicly available data. We show the detectable impact of interventions on the state of the epidemic and suggest that there is a single dominant trend observable through the principal score, but this is different across nations and waves. For example, the epidemic status can be tracked by cases in Scotland at a countrywide scale, whereas across waves and disjoint nations, hospitalisations are the dominant contributor to principal scores. Thus, our results suggest that hospitalisations may be an additional useful metric for ongoing tracking of the epidemic status across the UK nations alongside R and growth rate.","Swallow, Ben; Xiang, Wen; Panovska-Griffiths, Jasmina",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.03626v1.pdf,495

Our purpose is to report findings from a survey on the crisis impact among members of the Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology (SIRM). METHODS: All members were invited to a 42-question online survey about the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on personal and family life, professional activity, socioeconomic and psychological condition. Participants were classified based on working in the most severely affected Italian regions (""hot regions"") or elsewhere. RESULTS: A total of 2150 radiologists joined the survey. More than 60% of respondents estimated a workload reduction greater than 50%, with a higher prevalence among private workers in hot regions (72.7% vs 66.5% elsewhere, p = 0.1010). Most respondents were concerned that the COVID-19 outbreak could impact the management of non-COVID-19 patients and expected a work overload after the crisis. More than 40% were moderately or severely worried that their professional activity could be damaged, and most residents believed that their training had been affected. More than 50% of respondents had increased emotional stress at work, including moderate or severe symptoms due to sleep disturbances, feeling like living in slow motion and having negative thoughts, those latter being more likely in single-living respondents from hot regions [log OR 0.7108 (CI95% 0.3445 ÷ 1.0770), p = 0.0001]. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 outbreak has had a sensible impact on the working and personal life of SIRM members, with more specific criticalities in hot regions. Our findings could aid preserving the radiologists' wellbeing after the crisis.","Coppola, Francesca; Faggioni, Lorenzo; Neri, Emanuele; Grassi, Roberto; Miele, Vittorio",Insights Imaging,,495

The management of a lung transplantation (LTx) program and the therapeutic strategies to adapt the immunosuppressive regimen and antiviral measures is a major issue in the COVID-19 era, but little is known about worldwide practice. We sent out to 180 LTx centers worldwide in June 2020 a survey with 63 questions, both regarding the management of a LTx program in the COVID-19 era and the therapeutic strategies to treat COVID-19 LTx recipients. We received a total of 78 responses from 15 countries. Among participants, 81% declared a reduction of the activity and 47% restricted LTx for urgent cases only. Sixteen centers observed deaths on waiting listed patients and eight centers performed LTx for COVID-19 disease. In 62% of the centers, COVID-19 was diagnosed in LTx recipients, most of them not severe cases. The most common immunosuppressive management included a decreased dose or pausing of the cell cycle inhibitors. Remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, and azithromycin were the most proposed antiviral strategies. Most of the centers have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and proposed an active therapeutic strategy to treat LTx recipients with COVID-19.","Coiffard, Benjamin; Lepper, Philipp M; Prud039,; Homme, Eloi; Daviet, Florence; Cassir, Nadim; Wilkens, Heinrike; Hraiech, Sami; Langer, Frank; Thomas, Pascal A; Reynaud-Gaubert, Martine; Bals, Robert; Schäfers, Hans-Joachim; Papazian, Laurent; Seiler, Frederik",Am. j. transplant,,495

In this retrospective study, data were collected from 662 patients with severe/critical COVID-19 who were admitted to a designated hospital to treat patients with severe COVID-19 in Wuhan before March 20, 2020. All patients were divided into an exposed group (CHM users) and a control group (non-users). After propensity score matching in a 1:1 ratio, 156 CHM users were matched by propensity score to 156 non-users. No significant differences in seven baseline clinical variables were found between the two groups of patients. All-cause mortality was reported in 13 CHM users who died and 36 non-users who died. After multivariate adjustment, the mortality risk of CHM users was reduced by 82.2% (odds ratio 0.178, 95% CI 0.076-0.418; P < 0.001) compared with the non-users. Secondly, age (odds ratio 1.053, 95% CI 1.023-1.084; P < 0.001) and the proportion of severe/critical patients (odds ratio 0.063, 95% CI 0.028-0.143; P < 0.001) were the risk factors of mortality.

249486,Factors Associated with Mortality in Hospitalized Older Adults with COVID-19: A Large Retrospective Cohort Study,2021,"BACKGROUND: Skilled nursing facility (SNF) patients are medically complex with multiple, advanced chronic conditions. They are dependent on caregivers and have experienced recent acute illnesses. Among SNF patients, the rate of mortality or acute care use is over 50% within 90 days of discharge, yet these patients and their caregivers often do not receive the quality of transitional care that prepares them to manage serious illnesses at home. METHODS: The study will test the efficacy of Connect-Home, a successfully piloted transitional care intervention targeting seriously ill SNF patients discharged to home and their caregivers. The study setting will be SNFs in North Carolina, USA, and, following discharge, in patients' home. Using a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial design, six SNFs will transition at randomly assigned intervals from standard discharge planning to the Connect-Home intervention. The SNFs will contribute data for patients (N = 360) and their caregivers (N = 360), during both the standard discharge planning and Connect-Home time periods. Connect-Home is a two-step intervention: (a) SNF staff create an individualized Transition Plan of Care to manage the patient's illness at home; and (b) a Connect-Home Activation RN visits the patient's home to implement the written Transition Plan of Care. A key feature of the trial includes training of the SNF and Home Care Agency staff to complete the transition plan rather than using study interventionists. The primary outcomes will be patient preparedness for discharge and caregiver preparedness for caregiving role. With the proposed sample and using a two-sided test at the 5% significance level, we have 80% power to detect a 18% increase in the patient's preparedness for discharge score. We will employ linear mixed models to compare observations between intervention and usual care periods to assess primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes include (a) patients' quality of life, functional status, and days of acute care use and (b) caregivers' burden and distress. DISCUSSION: Study results will determine the efficacy of an intervention using existing clinical staff to (a) improve transitional care for seriously ill SNF patients and their caregivers, (b) prevent avoidable days of acute care use in a population with persistent risks from chronic conditions, and (c) advance the science of transitional care within end-of-life and palliative care trajectories of SNF patients and their caregivers. While this study protocol was being implemented, the COVID-19 pandemic occurred and this protocol was revised to mitigate COVID-related risks of patients, their caregivers, SNF staff, and the study team. Thus, this paper includes additional material describing these modifications. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03810534 .

Evidence is building that its origin as a zoonotic spillover occurred prior to the officially accepted timing of early December, 2019. Here we provide novel methods to date the origin of COVID-19 cases. We show that six countries had exceptionally early cases, unlikely to represent part of their main case series. The model suggests a likely timing of the first case of COVID-19 in China as November 17 (95% CI October 4). Origination dates are discussed for the first five countries outside China and each continent. Results infer that SARS-CoV-2 emerged in China in early October to mid-November, and by January, had spread globally. This suggests an earlier and more rapid timeline of spread.

257767,COVID-19 and diabetes: A bidirectional relationship./ COVID-19 y diabetes mellitus: una relación bidireccional,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) belongs to the single-stranded positive-sense RNA family. The virus contains a large genome that encodes four structural proteins, small envelope (E), matrix (M), nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N), spike (S), and 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp1-16) that together, ensure replication of the virus in the host cell. Among these proteins, the interactions of N and Nsp3 are essential that links the viral genome for processing. The N proteins reside at CoV RNA synthesis sites known as the replication-transcription complexes (RTCs). The N-terminal of N has RNA-binding domain (N-NTD), capturing the RNA genome while the C-terminal domain (N-CTD) anchors the viral Nsp3, a component of RTCs. Although the structural information has been recently released, the residues involved in contacts between N-CTD with Nsp3 are still unknown. To find the residues involved in interactions between two proteins, three-dimensional structures of both proteins were retrieved and docked using HADDOCK. Residues at N-CTD were detected in interaction with L499, R500, K501, V502, P503, T504, D505, N506, Y507, I508, T509, K529, K530K532, S533 of Nsp3 and N-NTD to synthesize SARS-CoV-2 RNA.

This level of uncertainty is mostly due to the complex dynamics of epidemics and their time-variant parameters. However, real transactional data can reduce uncertainty and provide a less noisy picture of the effectiveness of social distancing. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to integrate multiple transactional data sets (GPS mobility data from Google and Apple as well as disease statistics from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control) to study the role of social distancing policies in 26 countries and analyze the transmission rate of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic over the course of 5 weeks. METHODS: Relying on the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model and official COVID-19 reports, we first calculated the weekly transmission rate (ß) of COVID-19 in 26 countries for 5 consecutive weeks. Then, we integrated these data with the Google and Apple mobility data sets for the same time frame and used a machine learning approach to investigate the relationship between the mobility factors and ß values. RESULTS: Gradient boosted trees regression analysis showed that changes in mobility patterns resulting from social distancing policies explain approximately 47% of the variation in the disease transmission rates. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with simulation-based studies, real cross-national transactional data confirms the effectiveness of social distancing interventions in slowing the spread of COVID-19. In addition to providing less noisy and more generalizable support for the idea of social distancing, we provide specific insights for public health policy makers regarding locations that should be given higher priority for enforcing social distancing measures.","Delen, Dursun; Eryarsoy, Enes; Davazdahemami, Behrooz",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,495

However, the role of social media use in depression and suicidal ideation of the general public remains unclear. Related empirical studies were limited and reported inconsistent findings. Little is known about the potential underlying mechanisms that may illustrate the relationship between social media use and depression and suicidal ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study tested the mediation effects of social loneliness and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms on the relationship between social media use and depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation, as well as the moderation effect of age on the mediation models. METHODS: We administered a population-based random telephone survey in May and June 2020, when infection control measures were being vigorously implemented in Hong Kong. A total of 1070 adults (658 social media users and 412 nonusers) completed the survey. Structural equation modeling (SEM) and multigroup SEM were conducted to test the mediation and moderation effects. RESULTS: The weighted prevalence of probable depression was 11.6%; 1.6% had suicidal ideation in the past 2 weeks. Both moderated mediation models of depressive symptoms (&#967;262=335.3; P<.05; comparative fit index [CFI]=0.94; nonnormed fit index [NNFI]=0.92; root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA]=0.06) and suicidal ideation (&#967;234=50.8; P<.05; CFI=0.99; NNFI=0.99; RMSEA=0.02) showed acceptable model fit. There was a significantly negative direct effect of social media use on depressive symptoms among older people (ß=-.07; P=.04) but not among younger people (ß=.04; P=.55). The indirect effect via PTSD symptoms was significantly positive among both younger people (ß=.09; P=.02) and older people (ß=.10; P=.01). The indirect effect via social loneliness was significant among older people (ß=-.01; P=.04) but not among younger people (ß=.01; P=.31).

METHODS: We used the generalized linear model to examine the associations between non-pharmaceutical measures adopted by China and South Korea and the number of confirmed cases. Policy disparities were also discussed between these two countries. RESULTS: The results show that the following factors influence the number of confirmed cases in China: lockdown of Wuhan city (LWC); establishment of a Leading Group by the Central Government; raising the public health emergency response to the highest level in all localities; classifying management of ""four categories of personnel""; makeshift hospitals in operation (MHIO); pairing assistance (PA); launching massive community screening (LMCS). In South Korea, these following factors were the key influencing factors of the cumulative confirmed cases: raising the public alert level to orange (three out of four levels); raising the public alert to the highest level; launching drive-through screening centers (LDSC); screening all members of Shincheonji religious group; launching Community Treatment Center (LCTC); distributing public face masks nationwide and quarantining all travelers from overseas countries for 14 days.

259072,Double-edged sword of limiting healthcare provision for children in times of COVID-19: the hidden price we pay,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic is impacting HIV care globally, with gaps in HIV treatment expected to increase HIV transmission and HIV-related mortality. We estimated how COVID-19-related disruptions could impact HIV transmission and mortality among men who have sex with men (MSM) in four cities in China, over a one- and five-year time horizon. METHODS: Regional data from China indicated that the number of MSM undergoing facility-based HIV testing reduced by 59% during the COVID-19 pandemic, alongside reductions in ART initiation (34%), numbers of all sexual partners (62%) and consistency of condom use (25%), but initial data indicated no change in viral suppression. A mathematical model of HIV transmission/treatment among MSM was used to estimate the impact of disruptions on HIV infections/HIV-related deaths. Disruption scenarios were assessed for their individual and combined impact over one and five years for 3/4/6-month disruption periods, starting from 1 January 2020. RESULTS: Our model predicted new HIV infections and HIV-related deaths would be increased most by disruptions to viral suppression, with 25% reductions (25% virally suppressed MSM stop taking ART) for a three-month period increasing HIV infections by 5% to 14% over one year and deaths by 7% to 12%. Observed reductions in condom use increased HIV infections by 5% to 14% but had minimal impact (<1%) on deaths. Smaller impacts on infections and deaths (<3%) were seen for disruptions to facility HIV testing and ART initiation, but reduced partner numbers resulted in 11% to 23% fewer infections and 0.4% to 1.0% fewer deaths. Longer disruption periods (4/6 months) amplified the impact of disruption scenarios. When realistic disruptions were modelled simultaneously, an overall decrease in new HIV infections occurred over one year (3% to 17%), but not for five years (1% increase to 4% decrease), whereas deaths mostly increased over one year (1% to 2%) and five years (1.2 increase to 0.3 decrease). CONCLUSIONS: The overall impact of COVID-19 on new HIV infections and HIV-related deaths is dependent on the nature, scale and length of the various disruptions. Resources should be directed to ensuring levels of viral suppression and condom use are maintained to mitigate any adverse effects of COVID-19-related disruption on HIV transmission and control among MSM in China.","Booton, Ross D; Fu, Gengfeng; MacGregor, Louis; Li, Jianjun; Ong, Jason J; Tucker, Joseph D; Turner, Katherine Me; Tang, Weiming; Vickerman, Peter; Mitchell, Kate M",J Int AIDS Soc,,495

259890,Where Have All the Children Gone? Pediatric Perspectives on COVID-19 in New York City,2020,"Our knowledge of the evolution and the role of untranslated region (UTR) in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity is very limited. Leader sequence, originated from UTR, is found at the 5' ends of all encoded SARS-CoV-2 transcripts, highlighting its importance. Here, evolution of leader sequence was compared between human pathogenic and non-pathogenic coronaviruses. Then, profiling of microRNAs that can inactivate the key UTR regions of coronaviruses was carried out. A distinguished pattern of evolution in leader sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was found. Mining all available microRNA families against leader sequences of coronaviruses resulted in discovery of 39 microRNAs with a stable thermodynamic binding energy. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 had a lower binding stability against microRNAs. hsa-MIR-5004-3p was the only human microRNA able to target the leader sequence of SARS and to a lesser extent, also SARS-CoV-2. However, its binding stability decreased remarkably in SARS-COV-2. We found some plant microRNAs with low and stable binding energy against SARS-COV-2. Meta-analysis documented a significant (p < 0.01) decline in the expression of MIR-5004-3p after SARS-COV-2 infection in trachea, lung biopsy, and bronchial organoids as well as lung-derived Calu-3 and A549 cells. The paucity of the innate human inhibitory microRNAs to bind to leader sequence of SARS-CoV-2 can contribute to its high replication in infected human cells.","Mohammadi-Dehcheshmeh, Manijeh; Moghbeli, Sadrollah Molaei; Rahimirad, Samira; Alanazi, Ibrahim O; Shehri, Zafer Saad Al; Ebrahimie, Esmaeil",,,495
260970,Possible role of hypothyroidism in the prognosis of COVID-19,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the entire world and catapulted the United States into one of the deepest recessions in history. While this pandemic rages, the opioid crisis worsens. During this period, the pandemic has resulted in the decimation of most conventional medical services, including those of chronic pain management, with the exception of virtual care and telehealth. Many chronic pain patients have been impacted in numerous ways, with increases in cardiovascular disease, mental health problems, cognitive dysfunction, and early death. The epidemic has also resulted in severe economic and physiological consequences for providers. Drug deaths in America, which fell for the first time in 25 years in 2018, rose to record numbers in 2019 and are continuing to climb, worsened by the coronavirus pandemic. The opioid epidemic was already resurfacing with a 5% increase in overall deaths from 2018; however, the preliminary data show that prescription opioid deaths continued to decline, while at the same time deaths due to fentanyl, methamphetamine, and cocaine climbed, with some reductions in heroin deaths. The health tracker data also showed that along with an almost 88% decline in elective surgeries, pain-related prescriptions declined 15.1%. Despite increases in telehealth, outpatient services declined and only began returning towards normal at an extremely slow pace, accompanied by reduced productivity and increased practice costs. This review, therefore, emphasizes the devastating consequences of concurrent epidemics on chronic pain management and the need to develop best practice efforts to preserve access to treatment for chronic pain.","Manchikanti, Laxmaiah; Vanaparthy, Rachana; Atluri, Sairam; Sachdeva, Harsh; Kaye, Alan D; Hirsch, Joshua A",Pain Ther,,495

We compare health-related net benefit (HRNB) and GDP losses associated with government responses of the UK, Ireland, Germany, Spain, and Sweden from UK healthcare payer perspective. METHODS: We compared observed cases, hospitalisations, and deaths under ""mitigation"" to modelled events under ""no mitigation"" to 20th July 2020. We thus calculated healthcare costs, quality adjusted life years (QALYs), and HRNB at £20,000/QALY saved by each country. On per population (i.e. per capita) basis, we compared HRNB with forecast reductions in 2020 GDP growth (overall or compared to Sweden as minimal mitigation country) and qualitatively and quantitatively described government responses. RESULTS: The UK saved 3.17 (0.32-3.65) million QALYs, £33 (8-38) billion healthcare costs, and £1416 (220-1637) HRNB per capita at £20,000/QALY. Per capita, this is comparable to £1,455 GDP loss using Sweden as comparator and offsets 46.1 (7.1-53.2)% of total £3075 GDP loss.Germany, Spain, and Sweden had greater HRNB per capita. These also offset a greater percentage of total GDP losses per capita. Ireland fared worst on both measures. Countries with more mask wearing, testing, and population susceptibility had better outcomes. Highest stringency responses did not appear to have best outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Our exploratory analysis indicates the benefit of government covid-19 responses may outweigh their economic costs. The extent that HRNB offset economic losses appears to relate to population characteristics, testing levels, and mask wearing, rather than response stringency.","Thom, Howard; Walker, Josephine; Vickerman, Peter; Hollingworth, Will",Eur. j. public health,,495

263195,Telehealth and humanism: unexpected partnership forged during COVID-19,2020,"Introduction: The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) have changed into a global crisis. Psychologically, this process of alteration can lead to feelings of fear, insecurity, and anxiety. This fear and anxiety can be caused by a variety of factors. However, due to the lack of extensive studies at this time, there are little data on these conditions related to COVID-19. Therefore, in this narrative review, we have tried to identify the most important possible causes of anxiety and fear due to this disease, based on logical shreds of evidence. Then we tried to discuss the consequences and ways to manage and prevent them. Methods: The current focus was on three major axes of corona-phobia, fear and anxiety. PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Google Scholar and authoritative news and information sources were considered as the data sources. Results: Findings from the analysis of the results revealed that, in addition to the real and the logical reasons which belong to the intrinsic properties of SARS-CoV-2, some misleadings and misconceptions induced by media, governmental policies, public awareness level, and non-scientific speculations and contradictory data expressed by experts, researchers and scientific societies, could provide the way for the development of corona-phobia, and fear. Conclusions: Each of these causal components, in its place, leads to some degrees of psychological disorders and subsequent consequences and complications. Finally, here we reviewed, summarized the previous research findings on how to prevent and manage this type of psychological disorder, and made comparisons.","Heiat, M; Heiat, F; Halaji, M; Ranjbar, R; Tavangar Marvasti, Z; Yaali-Jahromi, E; Azizi, M M; Morteza Hosseini, S; Badri, T",Ann Ig,,495
263400,Streamlining Care in Crisis: Rapid Creation and Implementation of a Digital Support Tool for COVID-19,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate patient satisfaction after integration of audio-only virtual visits into a pre-existing prenatal care schedule within a large, county-based system during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. METHODS: We implemented audio-only prenatal virtual visits in response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic within a large, county-based prenatal care system serving predominantly women with low socioeconomic status and limited resources. Using a four-question telephone survey, we surveyed a cross-section of patients who had opted to participate in virtual visits to assess their level of satisfaction surrounding audio-only visits. In addition, average clinic wait times and attendance rates by visit type were examined. RESULTS: From March 17 to May 31, 2020, more than 4,000 audio-only virtual prenatal visits were completed in our system. After implementation, the percentage of visits conducted through the virtual platform gradually rose, with nearly 25% of weekly prenatal visits being performed through the virtual platform by the month of May. Clinic wait times trended downward after implementation of virtual visits (P<.001). On average, 88% of virtual prenatal visits were completed as scheduled, whereas only 82% of in-person visits were attended (P<.001). Hospital administration attempted to contact 431 patients who had participated in at least one virtual visit to assess patient satisfaction; 283 patients were reached and agreed to participate (65%). Ninety-nine percent of respondents reported that their needs were met during their audio-only virtual visits. The majority of patients preferred a combination of in-person and virtual visits for prenatal care, and patients reported many benefits with virtual visits.

265923,Implementation of a fetal ultrasound telemedicine service: women's views and family costs,2021,"Japan's government has taken a number of measures, including declaring a state of emergency, to combat the spread COVID-19. We examine the mechanisms through which the government's policies have led to changes in people's behavior. Using smartphone location data, we construct a daily prefecture-level stay-at-home measure to identify the following two effects: (1) the effect that citizens refrained from going out in line with the government's request, and (2) the effect that government announcements reinforced awareness with regard to the seriousness of the pandemic and people voluntarily refrained from going out. Our main findings are as follows. First, the declaration of the state of emergency reduced the number of people leaving their homes by 8.5% through the first channel, which is of the same order of magnitude as the estimates obtained for lockdowns in the United States. Second, a 1% increase in new infections in a prefecture reduces people's outings in that prefecture by 0.027%. Third, the government's requests are responsible for about one quarter of the decrease in outings in Tokyo, while the remaining three quarters are the result of citizens obtaining new information through government announcements and the daily release of the number of infections. The findings suggest that what mattered for containing the spread of COVID-19 was not strong, legally binding measures but the provision of appropriate information that encouraged people to change their behavior.","Watanabe, Tsutomu; Yabu, Tomoyoshi",PLoS One,,495

The DFT method at B3LYP/6-31 + G (d,p) level of theory was used. Reactivity indices, transition structures theory, IGM and ELF analysis were employed to reveal the mechanism of the reaction. The addition of DZM to PSH takes place through a one-step mechanism and an asynchronous transition states. Eight possible addition channels of reaction were investigated (addition of C (sp2) to Diazomethane at C4, C5, C6 or C7). The addition of C (sp2) at C5 leading to P1 product is the preferred channel. The addition of ether does not affect the chemo-, regio- and stereo-selectivity of the reaction. Analysis of transfer of charges along the IRC path associated with the P1 product shows a polar character for the studied reaction. We have also used the noncovalent interaction (NCI) which is very helpful to reveal the most favored addition channel of the reaction, by analyzing the weak interactions in different TSs.

Since then, the virus has claimed millions of lives worldwide. In 29th April 2020, there were more than 5,000 outbreak cases in Malaysia as reported by the Ministry of Health Malaysia (MOHE). This study aims to evaluate the trend analysis of the COVID-19 outbreak using Mann-Kendall test, and predict the future cases of COVID-19 in Malaysia using Recurrent Forecasting-Singular Spectrum Analysis (RF-SSA) model. The RF-SSA model was developed to measure and predict daily COVID-19 cases in Malaysia for the coming 10 days using previously-confi rmed cases. A Singular Spectrum Analysis-based forecasting model that discriminates noise in a time series trend is introduced. The RF-SSA model assessment is based on the World Health Organization (WHO) offi cial COVID-19 data to predict the daily confi rmed cases after 29th April until 9th May, 2020. The preliminary results of Mann-Kendall test showed a declining trend pattern for new cases during Restricted Movement Order (RMO) 3 compared to RMO1, RMO2 and RMO4, with a dramatic increase in the COVID-19 outbreak during RMO1. Overall, the RF-SSA has over-forecasted the cases by 0.36%. This indicates RF-SSA s competence to predict the impending number of COVID-19 cases. The proposed model predicted that Malaysia would hit single digit in daily confirmed cased of COVID-19 by early-June 2020. These findings have proven the capability of RF-SSA model in apprehending the trend and predict the cases of COVID-19 with high accuracy. Nevertheless, enhanced RF-SSA algorithm should to be developed for higher effectivity in capturing any extreme data changes. © 2021 Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty patients who underwent FDG PET-CT for assessment of a SPN were identified. Seven reporters with varied experience at four centres graded FDG uptake visually using the British Thoracic Society (BTS) four-point scale. Five reporters also scored SPNs according to three- and five-point visual assessment scales and using semi-quantitative assessment (maximum standardised uptake value [SUVmax]). Interobserver reliability was assessed with the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and weighted Cohen's kappa (&#954;). Diagnostic performance was evaluated by receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: Good interobserver reliability was demonstrated with the BTS scale (ICC=0.78, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.69-0.85) and five-point scale (ICC=0.78, 95 CI 0.68-0.86), whilst the three-point scale demonstrated moderate reliability (ICC=0.70, 95% CI: 0.59-0.80). Almost perfect agreement was achieved between two consultants (&#954;=0.85), and substantial agreement between two other consultants (&#954;=0.78) using the BTS scale. ROC curves for the BTS and five-point scales demonstrated equivalent accuracy (BTS area under the ROC curve [AUC]=0.768; five-point AUC=0.768). SUVmax was no more accurate compared to the BTS scale (SUVmax AUC=0.794; BTS AUC=0.768, p=0.43). CONCLUSIONS: The BTS scale can be applied reliably by reporters with varied levels of PET-CT reporting experience, across different centres and has a diagnostic performance that is not surpassed by alternative scales.","Fatania, K; Brown, P J; Xie, C; McDermott, G; Callister, M E J; Graham, R; Subesinghe, M; Gleeson, F V; Scarsbrook, A F",Clin. radiol,,495

The aim of this study was to describe the role of gender on clinical features and 28-day mortality in Covid-19 patients. METHODS: Observational study of Covid-19 patients hospitalized in Bergamo, Italy, during the first three weeks of the outbreak. Medical records, clinical, radiological and laboratory findings upon admission and treatment have been collected. Primary outcome was 28-day mortality since hospitalization. RESULTS: 431 consecutive adult patients were admitted. Female patients were 119 (27.6%) with a mean age of 67.0 ± 14.5 years (vs 67.8 ± 12.5 for males, p = 0.54). Previous history of myocardial infarction, vasculopathy and former smoking habits were more common for males. At the time of admission PaO2/FiO2 was similar between men and women (228 [IQR, 134-273] vs 238 mmHg [150-281], p = 0.28). Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) assistance was needed in the first 24 h more frequently in male patients (25.7% vs 13.0%; p = 0.006). Overall 28-day mortality was 26.1% in women and 38.1% in men (p = 0.018). Gender did not result an independent predictor of death once the parameters related to disease severity at presentation were included in the multivariable analysis (p = 0.898). Accordingly, the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis in female and male patients requiring CPAP or non-invasive ventilation in the first 24 h did not find a significant difference (p = 0.687). CONCLUSION: Hospitalized women are less likely to die from Covid-19; however, once severe disease occurs, the risk of dying is similar to men. Further studies are needed to better investigate the role of gender in clinical course and outcome of Covid-19.","Raimondi, Federico; Novelli, Luca; Ghirardi, Arianna; Russo, Filippo Maria; Pellegrini, Dario; Biza, Roberta; Trapasso, Roberta; Giuliani, Lisa; Anelli, Marisa; Amoroso, Mariangela; Allegri, Chiara; Imeri, Gianluca; Sanfilippo, Claudia; Comandini, Sofia; Hila, England; Manesso, Leonardo; Gandini, Lucia; Mandelli, Pietro; Monti, Martina; Gori, Mauro; Senni, Michele; Lorini, Ferdinando Luca; Rizzi, Marco; Barbui, Tiziano; Paris, Laura; Rambaldi, Alessandro; Cosentini, Roberto; Guagliumi, Giulio; Cesa, Simonetta; Colledan, Michele; Sessa, Maria; Masciulli, Arianna; Gavazzi, Antonello; Buoro, Sabrina; Remuzzi, Giuseppe; Ruggenenti, Piero; Callegaro, Annapaola; Gianatti, Andrea; Farina, Claudio; Bellasi, Antonio; Sironi, Sandro; Fagiuoli, Stefano; Di Marco, Fabiano",BMC Pulm Med,,495

This study analyzed the change in columnar nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM2.5, aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 µm) in five megacities of South Asian countries (Delhi, Dhaka, Kathmandu, Kolkata, and Lahore) from April 1-May 31 over the previous three years (2018-2020). The Dutch-Finnish Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) provided satellite-based daily tropospheric columnar NO2 values for this study. Ground-based hourly PM2.5 data were collected from the World's Air Pollution: Real-time Air Quality Index Project. The study observed a decrease of tropospheric columnar NO2 in selected cities in 2020 compared to 2018 and 2019 from April 1-May 31. The mean daily reading of PM2.5 was 36.56% and 45.44% less in Delhi;12.67% and 23.46% less in Dhaka;in Kathmandu 28.32% and 37.42% less;in Kolkata 41.02% less in 2020 than 2018 and 34.08% less in 2019 during April 1-May 31. The PM2.5 was 44.26% less in 2020 than in 2019 during April 9-May 31 in Lahore. The daily mean difference in concentration during April 1-May 31, 2018-2020 was significantly lower at α=0.01 level for both pollutants.

OBJECTIVE: To find out how children in residential care perceived the influence of the COVID-19 lockdown in their everyday life, relationships and subjective well-being. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: 856 children from 10 to 17 years old (Mage = 15.5, males = 71.2%, females = 28.8%) living in residential centres in Catalonia. METHODS: Cross-sectional study. Children responded to an on-line questionnaire administered between June and July 2020. Bivariate analysis and multiple linear regression were used comparing the answers by sex. RESULTS: Better relationships with caregivers (ß = 9.156, [4.089-14.22], r2 = 0.244, p < .01) and having a person of trust (ß = 4.588, [2.041-7.134], r2 = 0.244, p < .01) were found to be relevant for children's subjective well-being. For girls, improving their grades (ß = 14.86, [8.560-21.15], r2 = 0.234, p < .01) were relevant while boys' subjective well-being was significantly affected by an increase in use of social networks (ß = 8.917, [2.733-15.10], r2 = 0.234, p < .01).

The descriptors' performance is hereby illustrated for nucleotide analogue drugs that inhibit the ribonucleic acid-dependent ribonucleic acid polymerase, key to viral transcription and genome replication. The COSMO-RS-based descriptors account for both chemical reactivity and structure, and are more effective for ML-based screening than fingerprints based on molecular structure and simple physical/chemical properties. The descriptors are evaluated using principal component analysis, an unsupervised ML technique. Our results correlate with the active monophosphate forms of the leading drug remdesivir and the prospective drug EIDD-2801 with nucleotides, followed by other promising drugs, and are superior to those from molecular structure-based descriptors and molecular docking.

Lockdown measures, shown to be effective in reducing the number of new cases, may not have been effective in the same way for all, failing to protect the most vulnerable populations. This survey aims to assess social inequalities in the trends in COVID-19 infections following lockdown. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey conducted among the general population in France in April 2020, during COVID-19 lockdown. Ten thousand one hundred one participants aged 18-64, from a national cohort who lived in the three metropolitan French regions most affected by the first wave of COVID-19. The main outcome was occurrence of possible COVID-19 symptoms, defined as the occurrence of sudden onset of cough, fever, dyspnea, ageusia and/or anosmia, that lasted more than 3 days in the 15 days before the survey. We used multinomial regression models to identify social and health factors related to possible COVID-19 before and during the lockdown. RESULTS: In all, 1304 (13.0%; 95% CI: 12.0-14.0%) reported cases of possible COVID-19. The effect of lockdown on the occurrence of possible COVID-19 was different across social hierarchies. The most privileged class individuals saw a significant decline in possible COVID-19 infections between the period prior to lockdown and during the lockdown (from 8.8 to 4.3%, P = 0.0001) while the decline was less pronounced among working class individuals (6.9% before lockdown and 5.5% during lockdown, P = 0.03). This differential effect of lockdown remained significant after adjusting for other factors including history of chronic disease. The odds of being infected during lockdown as opposed to the prior period increased by 57% among working class individuals (OR = 1.57; 95% CI: 1.00-2.48). The same was true for those engaged in in-person professional activities during lockdown (OR = 1.53; 95% CI: 1.03-2.29). CONCLUSIONS: Lockdown was associated with social inequalities in the decline in COVID-19 infections, calling for the adoption of preventive policies to account for living and working conditions. Such adoptions are critical to reduce social inequalities related to COVID-19, as working-class individuals also have the highest COVID-19 related mortality, due to higher prevalence of comorbidities.","Bajos, Nathalie; Jusot, Florence; Pailhé, Ariane; Spire, Alexis; Martin, Claude; Meyer, Laurence; Lydié, Nathalie; Franck, Jeanna-Eve; Zins, Marie; Carrat, Fabrice",BMC Public Health,,495

ARMC5-inactivating variants cause adrenal tumors and possibly other neoplasms. OBJECTIVE: To investigate a large cohort spNETs or MEN1 patients for changes in the ARMC5 gene. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 111 patients, 94 with spNET and 17 with MEN1 were screened for ARMC5 germline alterations. 36 tumors (18 spNETs and 18 MEN1-related) were collected from 20 patients. Blood and tumor DNA samples were genotyped using Sanger sequencing and microsatellite markers for chromosomes. ARMC5 and MEN1 expression were assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). RESULTS: In 76/111 (68.4%) patients, we identified 16 different ARMC5 germline variants; two predicted as damaging. No differences on the prevalence of ARMC5 variants depending on the MEN1 status adrenal lesions. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at chromosome 16p and ARMC5 germline variants were present together in 23/34 (67.6%) tumors; in 7/23 (30.4%) their presence led to biallelic inactivation of the ARMC5 gene. The latter was more prevalent in MEN1-related tumors than in spNETs (88.9% vs 38.9%; p=0.0045). LOH at the chromosome 16p (ARMC5) and 11q (MEN1) loci coexisted in 16/18 MEN1-related tumors, which also expressed lower ARMC5 (p=0.017) and MEN1 (p=0.011) proteins compared to peri-tumorous tissues. CONCLUSION: Germline ARMC5 variants are common among spNET and MEN1 patients. ARMC5 haploinsufficiency or biallelic inactivation in spNETs and MEN1-related tumors suggests that ARMC5 may have a role in modifying the phenotype of patients with spNETs and/or MEN1 beyond its known role in macronodular adrenocortical hyperplasia.","Damjanovic, Svetozar S; Antic, Jadranka A; Elezovic-Kovacevic, Valentina I; Dundjerovic, Dusko M; Milicevic, Ivana T; Beleslin-Cokic, Bojana B; Ilic, Bojana B; Rodic, Gordana S; Berthon, Annabel; Maria, Andrea Gutierrez; Faucz, Fabio R; Stratakis, Constantine A",J. clin. endocrinol. metab,,495

We describe the organizational process in setting up a coronavirus disease 2019 triage unit in a Swiss tertiary care hospital. Methods: Our triage unit was set-up outside of the main hospital building and consists of three areas: 1. Pre-triage, 2. Triage, and 3. Triage plus. The Pre-triage check-points identify any potential COVID-19-infected patients and re-direct them to the main Triage area where trained medical staff screen which patients undergo diagnostic testing. If testing is indicated, nasopharyngeal swabs are performed. If patients require further investigations, they are referred to Triage plus. At this stage, patients are then discharged home after additional testing or admitted to the hospital for management. Observations: A total of 1265 patients were screened between 10 March 2020 and 12 April 2020 at our Triage unit. Of these, 112 (8.9%) tested positive. 73 (65%) of the positively-tested patients were female and 39 (35%) were male. The mean age for all patients was 43.8 years (SD 16.3 years). Distinguishing between genders, mean age for females was 41.1 (SD 16.5) and mean age for males was 48.6 (SD 14.9), with females being significantly younger than males (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Our triage unit was set-up as part of a large-scale restructuring process. Current challenges include low sensitivity for test results as well as limited staff and resources. We hope that our experience will help other health care institutions develop similar triage systems.","Peros, Georgios; Gronki, Ferda; Molitor, Nadine; Streit, Michael; Sugimoto, Kiyoshi; Karrer, Urs; Lunger, Fabian; Adamina, Michel; Breitenstein, Stefan; Lamdark, Tenzin",Emerg Microbes Infect,,495

This study aims to assess the effect of unintended delays in anti-VEGF treatment during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. This retrospective case series identified patients receiving regularly scheduled anti-VEGF intravitreal injections based on current procedural terminology (CPT) code at two practices in Minnesota. Diagnoses were limited to nAMD, diabetic macular edema (DME), proliferative diabetic retinopathy, and RVO. Patients were divided into two groups based on whether they maintained or delayed their follow-up visit by more than two weeks beyond the recommended treatment interval during the COVID-19 lockdown. The 'COVID-19 lockdown' was defined as the period after March, 28th, 2020, when a lockdown was declared in Minnesota. We then compared the visual acuity and structural changes to the retina using ocular coherence tomography (OCT) to assess whether delayed treatment resulted in worse visual outcomes. A total of 167 eyes from 117 patients met criteria for inclusion in this study. In the delayed group, the average BCVA at the pre- and post-lockdown visits were 0.614 and 0.715 (logMAR) respectively (p = 0.007).

295315,"Reply to: ""A multifaceted virus. Non-reducible and strangulated effects of COVID-19""",2021,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) has emerged as an invasive fungal disease, often affecting previously immunocompetent, mechanically ventilated, intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Incidence rates of 3.8%-33.3% have been reported depending on the geographic area, with high (47%) mortality. OBJECTIVES: Here, we describe a single-centre prospective case series with CAPA cases from both the first (March-May, n = 5/33) and second (mid-September through mid-December, n = 8/33) COVID-19 wave at a 500-bed teaching hospital in the Netherlands. PATIENTS/METHODS: In the first COVID-19 wave, a total of 265 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive patients were admitted to our hospital of whom 33 needed intubation and mechanical ventilation. In the second wave, 508 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive patients were admitted of whom 33 needed mechanical ventilation. Data were prospectively collected. RESULTS: We found a significant decrease in COVID-19 patients needing mechanical ventilation in the ICU in the second wave (p < .01). From these patients, however, a higher percentage were diagnosed with CAPA (24.2% vs 15.2%), although not significant (p = .36). All CAPA patients encountered in the second wave received dexamethasone. Mortality between both groups was similarly high (40%-50%). Moreover, we found environmental TR34 /L98H azole-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus isolates in two separate patients. CONCLUSIONS: In this series, 19.7% (n = 13/66) of mechanically ventilated SARS-CoV-2 patients were diagnosed with CAPA. In addition, we found a significant reduction in COVID-19 patients needing mechanical ventilation on the ICU in the second wave. Numbers are too small to determine whether there is a true difference in CAPA incidence in mechanically ventilated patients between the two waves, and whether it could be attributed to dexamethasone SARS-CoV-2 therapy.","Meijer, Eelco F J; Dofferhoff, Anton S M; Hoiting, Oscar; Meis, Jacques F",Mycoses,,495

As troponin, a biomarker of cardiac injury, often rises in hospitalized patients, its interpretation and actionability require careful consideration. Fulminant myocarditis due to direct viral infection can certainly occur, but in patients with increased oxygen demands due to tachycardia and fever and reduced oxygen delivery due to hypotension and hypoxemia, COVID-19 disease can cause myocardial injury indirectly. Cytokines released during the acute infection can elicit activation of cells within pre-existing atherosclerotic lesions, augmenting thrombotic risk and risk of ischemic syndromes. Moreover, microvascular activation by cytokines can cause not only myocardial injury but can also harm other organ systems commonly involved in COVID-19 infections including the kidneys. Dealing with the immense challenge of COVID-19, confronted with severely ill patients in dire straits with virtually no rigorous evidence base to guide our therapy, we must call on our clinical skills and judgment. These touchstones can help guide us in selecting patients who might benefit from the advanced imaging and invasive procedures that present enormous logistical challenges in the current context. Lacking a robust evidence base, pathophysiologic reasoning can help guide our choices of therapy for individual clinical scenarios. We must exercise caution and extreme humility, as often plausible interventions fail when tested rigorously. But act today we must, and understanding the multiplicity of mechanisms of myocardial injury in COVID-19 infection will help us meet our mission unsupported by the comfort of strong data.","Libby, Peter",JACC Basic Transl Sci,,495

Exacerbated inflammation and dysregulated immune responses involving T and myeloid cells occur in COVID-19 patients with severe clinical progression. However, the differential contribution of specific subsets of dendritic cells and monocytes to ARDS is still poorly understood. In addition, the role of CD8+ T cells present in the lung of COVID-19 patients and relevant for viral control has not been characterized. Here, we have studied the frequencies and activation profiles of dendritic cells and monocytes present in the blood and lung of COVID-19 patients with different clinical severity in comparison with healthy individuals. Furthermore, these subpopulations and their association with antiviral effector CD8+ T cell subsets were also characterized in lung infiltrates from critical COVID-19 patients. Our results indicate that inflammatory transitional and nonclassical monocytes and CD1c+ conventional dendritic cells preferentially migrate from blood to lungs in patients with severe COVID-19. Thus, this study increases the knowledge of specific myeloid subsets involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 disease and could be useful for the design of therapeutic strategies for fighting SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Sánchez-Cerrillo, Ildefonso; Landete, Pedro; Aldave, Beatriz; Sánchez-Alonso, Santiago; Sánchez-Azofra, Ana; Marcos-Jiménez, Ana; Ávalos, Elena; Alcaraz-Serna, Ana; de Los Santos, Ignacio; Mateu-Albero, Tamara; Esparcia, Laura; López-Sanz, Celia; Martínez-Fleta, Pedro; Gabrie, Ligia; Del Campo Guerola, Luciana; de la Fuente, Hortensia; Calzada, María J; González-Álvaro, Isidoro; Alfranca, Arantzazu; Sánchez-Madrid, Francisco; Muñoz-Calleja, Cecilia; Soriano, Joan B; Ancochea, Julio; Martín-Gayo, Enrique",J. clin. invest,,495
297226,Emergency department visits for pediatric traumatic injuries during general confinement: A single-center study in an urban setting,2021,"BACKGROUND: The risks from potential exposure to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and resource reallocation that has occurred to combat the pandemic, have altered the balance of benefits and harms that informed current (pre-COVID-19) guideline recommendations for lung cancer screening and lung nodule evaluation. Consensus statements were developed to guide clinicians managing lung cancer screening programs and patients with lung nodules during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An expert panel of 24 members, including pulmonologists (n = 17), thoracic radiologists (n = 5), and thoracic surgeons (n = 2), was formed. The panel was provided with an overview of current evidence, summarized by recent guidelines related to lung cancer screening and lung nodule evaluation. The panel was convened by video teleconference to discuss and then vote on statements related to 12 common clinical scenarios. A predefined threshold of 70% of panel members voting agree or strongly agree was used to determine if there was a consensus for each statement. Items that may influence decisions were listed as notes to be considered for each scenario. RESULTS: Twelve statements related to baseline and annual lung cancer screening (n = 2), surveillance of a previously detected lung nodule (n = 5), evaluation of intermediate and high-risk lung nodules (n = 4), and management of clinical stage I non-small-cell lung cancer (n = 1) were developed and modified. All 12 statements were confirmed as consensus statements according to the voting results. The consensus statements provide guidance about situations in which it was believed to be appropriate to delay screening, defer surveillance imaging of lung nodules, and minimize nonurgent interventions during the evaluation of lung nodules and stage I non-small-cell lung cancer. CONCLUSIONS: There was consensus that during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is appropriate to defer enrollment in lung cancer screening and modify the evaluation of lung nodules due to the added risks from potential exposure and the need for resource reallocation. There are multiple local, regional, and patient-related factors that should be considered when applying these statements to individual patient care.","Mazzone, Peter J; Gould, Michael K; Arenberg, Douglas A; Chen, Alexander C; Choi, Humberto K; Detterbeck, Frank C; Farjah, Farhood; Fong, Kwun M; Iaccarino, Jonathan M; Janes, Samuel M; Kanne, Jeffrey P; Kazerooni, Ella A; MacMahon, Heber; Naidich, David P; Powell, Charles A; Raoof, Suhail; Rivera, M Patricia; Tanner, Nichole T; Tanoue, Lynn K; Tremblay, Alain; Vachani, Anil; White, Charles S; Wiener, Renda Soylemez; Silvestri, Gerard A",J Am Coll Radiol,,495

Understanding smokers' responses to the pandemic will help assess its public health impact and inform future public health and provider messages to smokers. OBJECTIVE: To assess risk perceptions and change in tobacco use among current and former smokers during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey conducted in May-July 2020 (55% response rate) PARTICIPANTS: 694 current and former daily smokers (mean age 53, 40% male, 78% white) who had been hospitalized pre-COVID-19 and enrolled into a smoking cessation clinical trial at hospitals in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee. MAIN MEASURES: Perceived risk of COVID-19 due to tobacco use; changes in tobacco consumption and interest in quitting tobacco use; self-reported quitting and relapse since January 2020. KEY RESULTS: 68% (95% CI, 65-72%) of respondents believed that smoking increases the risk of contracting COVID-19 or having a more severe case. In adjusted analyses, perceived risk was higher in Massachusetts where COVID-19 had already surged than in Pennsylvania and Tennessee which were pre-surge during survey administration (AOR 1.56, 95% CI, 1.07-2.28). Higher perceived COVID-19 risk was associated with increased interest in quitting smoking (AOR 1.72, 95% CI 1.01-2.92). During the pandemic, 32% (95% CI, 27-37%) of smokers increased, 37% (95% CI, 33-42%) decreased, and 31% (95% CI, 26-35%) did not change their cigarette consumption. Increased smoking was associated with higher perceived stress (AOR 1.49, 95% CI 1.16-1.91). Overall, 11% (95% CI, 8-14%) of respondents who smoked in January 2020 (pre-COVID-19) had quit smoking at survey (mean, 6 months later) while 28% (95% CI, 22-34%) of former smokers relapsed. Higher perceived COVID-19 risk was associated with higher odds of quitting and lower odds of relapse. CONCLUSIONS: Most smokers believed that smoking increased COVID-19 risk. Smokers' responses to the pandemic varied, with increased smoking related to stress and increased quitting associated with perceived COVID-19 vulnerability.","Rigotti, Nancy A; Chang, Yuchiao; Regan, Susan; Lee, Scott; Kelley, Jennifer H K; Davis, Esa; Levy, Douglas E; Singer, Daniel E; Tindle, Hilary A",J. gen. intern. med,,495

The figures of violence against women, and child sexual abuse are increasingly being reported during the lockdown and thereafter. To mitigate this, a response against VAWG should not be a missing agenda. This commentary focuses on the situation of VAWG during COVID-19 induced restrictions in Nepal and offers a way forward for addressing the issue.","Dahal, Minakshi; Khanal, Pratik; Maharjan, Sajana; Panthi, Bindu; Nepal, Sushil",Global Health,,495

Constrained by the macrocyclic molecular structure, the separations between the N atoms in this bifurcated hydrogen bond are about 2.6 Å, considerably shorter than those typically observed for hydrogen bonded systems in the condensed phases. As such, TAPH exhibits significantly elongated N-H lengths in its hydrogen bond and a downfield 1H NMR chemical shift of 22.1 ppm. In this work, we carry out ab initio molecular dynamics and ab initio path integral molecular dynamics simulations of TAPH in the acetonitrile solution to reveal the geometry and proton sharing conditions of the bifurcated short hydrogen bond and uncover how the interplay of electronic and nuclear quantum effects gives rise to its far downfield 1H chemical shift. Taking a linear short hydrogen bond as a reference, we demonstrate the distinct features of competing quantum effects and electronic shielding effects in the bifurcated hydrogen bond of TAPH. We further use the degree of deshielding on the proton as a measure of the hydrogen bonding interactions and evaluate the strength of the bifurcated short hydrogen bond as compared to its linear counterpart.","Zhou, Shengmin; Wang, Lu",J Chem Phys,,495

The prompt outbreak of COVID-19 and its quick spread without any controllable measure defines the severity of the situation. In this crisis, a collective pool of knowledge about the advancement of clinical diagnostic and management for COVID-19 is a prerequisite. Here, we summarize all the available updates on the multidisciplinary approaches for the advancement of diagnosis and proposed therapeutic strategies for COVID-19. Moreover, the review discusses different aspects of the COVID-19, including its epidemiology; incubation period; the general clinical features of patients; the clinical features of intensive care unit (ICU) patients; SARS-CoV-2 infection in the presence of co-morbid diseases and the clinical features of pediatric patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2. Advances in various diagnostic approaches, such as the use of real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), chest radiography, and computed tomography (CT) imaging; and other modern diagnostic methods, for this infection have been highlighted. However, due to the unavailability of adequate evidence, presently there are no officially approved drugs or vaccines available against SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, we have discussed various therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 under different categories, like the possible treatment plans with drug (antiviral drugs and anti-cytokines) therapy for disease prevention. Lastly, potentials candidates for the vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infection have been described. Collectively, the review provides an overview of the SARS-CoV-2 infection outbreak along with the recent advancements and strategies for diagnosis and therapy of COVID-19.","Chakraborty, C; Sharma, A R; Sharma, G; Bhattacharya, M; Lee, S S",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,495

In a cohort of 647 SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects, we found that both the magnitude of Ab responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and nucleoprotein and nAb titers correlate with clinical scores. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) is immunodominant and the target of 90% of the neutralizing activity present in SARS-CoV-2 immune sera. Whereas overall RBD-specific serum IgG titers waned with a half-life of 49 days, nAb titers and avidity increased over time for some individuals, consistent with affinity maturation. We structurally defined an RBD antigenic map and serologically quantified serum Abs specific for distinct RBD epitopes leading to the identification of two major receptor-binding motif antigenic sites. Our results explain the immunodominance of the receptor-binding motif and will guide the design of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics.","Piccoli, Luca; Park, Young-Jun; Tortorici, M Alejandra; Czudnochowski, Nadine; Walls, Alexandra C; Beltramello, Martina; Silacci-Fregni, Chiara; Pinto, Dora; Rosen, Laura E; Bowen, John E; Acton, Oliver J; Jaconi, Stefano; Guarino, Barbara; Minola, Andrea; Zatta, Fabrizia; Sprugasci, Nicole; Bassi, Jessica; Peter, Alessia; De Marco, Anna; Nix, Jay C; Mele, Federico; Jovic, Sandra; Rodriguez, Blanca Fernandez; Gupta, Sneha V; Jin, Feng; Piumatti, Giovanni; Lo Presti, Giorgia; Pellanda, Alessandra Franzetti; Biggiogero, Maira; Tarkowski, Maciej; Pizzuto, Matteo S; Cameroni, Elisabetta; Havenar-Daughton, Colin; Smithey, Megan; Hong, David; Lepori, Valentino; Albanese, Emiliano; Ceschi, Alessandro; Bernasconi, Enos; Elzi, Luigia; Ferrari, Paolo; Garzoni, Christian; Riva, Agostino; Snell, Gyorgy; Sallusto, Federica; Fink, Katja; Virgin, Herbert W; Lanzavecchia, Antonio; Corti, Davide; Veesler, David",Cell,,495

METHODS: Daily isolation data, obtained through geolocation information by mobile phone, were evaluated together with the number of daily infections and deaths by COVID-19 in the state of Sao Paulo. The study was conducted from February 26 to May 19, 2020. The data were modeled through the vector autoregression (VAR) model. RESULTS: The isolation index has an effect of approximately 5% in variation in the number of infections, and 7% in the number of deaths. The impulse response function (IRF) caused a drop of 0.15% in the number of new cases/day, and 0.17% in the number of deaths/day following a shock in the isolation index. For both cases, this effect occurred 1 day after the shock and stabilized after 10 periods. An increase of 1% in the isolation index led to a reduction of 6.91% in new cases and 6.90% in the number of deaths. The 30 cumulative day reduction reached 22.72% in terms of transmission and 35.39% for deaths. CONCLUSIONS: The social isolation index is related to deaths and infections from SARS-CoV-2. Although distancing measures are accompanied with impacts on the economy and the emergence of other morbidities, the benefits caused by the reduction in the speed of contagion are significant. The adoption of distancing measures has a substantial impact on the number of infected individuals and deaths by COVID-19.","de Souza Melo, A.; da Penha Sobral, A. I. G.; Marinho, M. L.

In the last years, navitoclax has emerged as a possible treatment for TNBC. Nevertheless, rapid navitoclax resistance onset has been observed thorough Mcl-1 overexpression. As a strategy to overcome Mcl-1-mediated resistance, herein we present a controlled drug co-delivery system based on mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) targeted to TNBC cells. The nanocarrier is loaded with navitoclax and the Mcl-1 inhibitor S63845 and capped with a MUC1-targeting aptamer (apMUC1-MSNs(Nav/S63845)). The apMUC1-capped nanoparticles effectively target TNBC cell lines and successfully induce apoptosis, overcoming navitoclax resistance. Moreover, navitoclax encapsulation protects platelets against apoptosis. These results point apMUC1-gated MSNs as suitable BH3 mimetics nanocarriers in the targeted treatment of MUC1-expressing TNBC.","Vivo-Llorca, Gema; Candela-Noguera, Vicente; Alfonso-Navarro, Maria; García-Fernández, Alba; Orzáez, Mar; Sancenón, Félix; Martínez-Máñez, Ramón",Chemistry,,495

We sought to use deep learning (DL) to study the biology of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity by identifying transcriptomic patterns and cell types associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity. To do this, we developed a new approach to generating self-supervised edge features. We propose a model that builds on Graph Attention Networks (GAT), creates edge features using self-supervised learning, and ingests these edge features via a Set Transformer. This model achieves significant improvements in predicting the disease state of individual cells, given their transcriptome. We apply our model to single-cell RNA sequencing datasets of SARS-CoV-2 infected lung organoids and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples of patients with COVID-19, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both datasets with our model. We then borrow from the field of explainable AI (XAI) to identify the features (genes) and cell types that discriminate bystander vs. infected cells across time and moderate vs. severe COVID-19 disease. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first application of DL to identifying the molecular and cellular determinants of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity using single-cell omics data.","Sehanobish, A.; Ravindra, N.; Van Dijk, D.; Assoc Advancement Artificial, Intelligence",35th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence / 33rd Conference on Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence / 11th Symposium on Educational Advances in Artificial Intelligence,,495

So far, this growth scheme has achieved a great success in the growth of III-nitride LEDs on c-plane substrates, but has not yet been applied in the growth of any other orientated III-nitride LEDs. In this paper, we have applied this growth scheme in the growth of semi-polar (11-22) green LEDs, and have investigated the impact of the SLS pre-layer on the optical performance of semi-polar (11-22) green LEDs grown on patterned (113) silicon substrates. Our results demonstrate that the semi-polar LEDs with the SLS pre-layer exhibit an improvement in both internal quantum efficiency and light output, which is similar to their c-plane counterparts. However, the performance improvement is not so significant as in the c-plane case. This is because the SLS pre-layer also introduces extra misfit dislocations for the semi-polar, but not the c-plane case, which act as non-radiative recombination centres.","Zhao, X; Huang, K; Bruckbauer, J; Shen, S; Zhu, C; Fletcher, P; Feng, P; Cai, Y; Bai, J; Trager-Cowan, C; Martin, R W; Wang, T",Sci Rep,,495

METHODS: A rapid review was undertaken in PubMed, Europe PubMed Central and EMBASE from 1 January 2020 to 26 August 2020. RESULTS: We identified 15 relevant studies, including 13 virus culture and 2 contact tracing studies. For 5 virus culture studies, the last day on which SARS-CoV-2 was isolated occurred within 10 days of symptom onset. For another 5 studies, SARS-CoV-2 was isolated beyond day 10 for approximately 3% of included patients. The remaining 3 virus culture studies included patients with severe or critical disease; SARS-CoV-2 was isolated up to day 32 in one study. Two studies identified immunocompromised patients from whom SARS-CoV-2 was isolated for up to 20 days. Both contact tracing studies, when close contacts were first exposed greater than 5 days after symptom onset in the index case, found no evidence of laboratory-confirmed onward transmission of SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients with mild-to-moderate illness are highly unlikely to be infectious beyond 10 days of symptoms. However, evidence from a limited number of studies indicates that patients with severe-to-critical illness or who are immunocompromised, may shed infectious virus for longer.","Walsh, Kieran A; Spillane, Susan; Comber, Laura; Cardwell, Karen; Harrington, Patricia; Connell, Jeff; Teljeur, Conor; Broderick, Natasha; de Gascun, Cillian F; Smith, Susan M; Ryan, Máirín; O039,; Neill, Michelle",J Infect,,495

315199,"Filtration Efficiency, Effectiveness, and Availability of N95 Face Masks for COVID-19 Prevention",2020,"Introduction and Objectives The COVID-19 pandemic brought new challenges to the healthcare system, with every patient contact a potential risk to staff This required rapid changes to traditional working methods in order to protect healthcare staff from virus exposure, reduce staff anxiety, and manage limited Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) supplies We aimed to rapidly implement a new strategy for ward working, which would maintain high-quality patient care while reducing staff virus exposure and PPE consumption Methods We developed an integrated team working concept called SPACES (Shared Patient Assessments Cuts Exposure for Staff) to gain maximum benefit from every staff-patient contact, regardless of the individual's team role For example, a doctor undertaking a ward round would also perform observations, deliver meals, drinks and medication, and undertake procedures such as venesection, at one single visit saving patient contacts by other healthcare colleagues All staff applied the same principle for each patient contact We recorded individual staff entries into each bay (n=5) and side room (n=7) over 24 hours using the SPACES approach, and compared this to pre-SPACES estimates We also reviewed Ward patient and staff feedback pre- A nd post-SPACES Results We estimated that pre-SPACES there were 97 individual staff entries into a bay of 4 patients, and 36 into each side room, per 24 hours Using SPACES, we reduced this to a median [IQR] of 20 [12-22] entries per bay and 11 [10-16] entries per side room (p=0 06 and 0 02 respectively) This decreased PPE consumption by approximately 75% Patient satisfaction survey responses before and after implementing SPACES were unchanged Staff feedback on SPACES reflected high levels of satisfaction, increased sense of teamwork, and reduced anxiety of contracting COVID-19 Conclusions We showed that using the SPACES initiative in a COVID-19 ward decreased staff exposure to highly infectious patients, with resultant PPE use reductions, while maintaining a high standard of patient care and strengthening team spirit and staff morale Following our successful trial period, SPACES received support from the British Thoracic Society and the Royal Colleges of Physicians and Nursing It has been adopted throughout our trust, and by many centres internationally","Poudel, A.; Essalmi, Y.; Desai, K.; Rehal, A.; Russell, R.; Shaw, S.; Bennett, J.",Thorax,,495

316133,The prevalence of common and stress-related mental health disorders in healthcare workers based in pandemic-affected hospitals: a rapid systematic review and meta-analysis,2020,"CONTEXT: Pediatric family-centered rounds (FCRs) have been shown to have benefits in staff satisfaction, teaching, and rounding efficiency, but no systematic review has been conducted to explicitly examine the humanistic impact of FCRs. OBJECTIVE: The objective with this review is to determine if FCRs promote the core values of humanism in medicine by answering the question, ""Do FCRs promote humanistic pediatric care?"" DATA SOURCES: Using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we conducted a search of PubMed, Web of Science, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Dissertation Abstracts for peer-reviewed pediatric studies through January 1, 2020. We used search terms including FCRs, communication, humanism, and the specific descriptors in the Gold Foundation's definition of humanism. STUDY SELECTION: Abstracts (n = 1003) were assessed for 5 primary outcomes: empathy, enhanced communication, partnership, respect, and satisfaction and service. We evaluated 158 full-text articles for inclusion, reconciling discrepancies through an iterative process. DATA EXTRACTION: Data abstraction, thematic analysis, and conceptual synthesis were conducted on 29 studies. RESULTS: Pediatric family-centered rounds (FCRs) improved humanistic outcomes within all 5 identified themes. Not all studies revealed improvement within every category. The humanistic benefits of FCRs are enhanced through interventions targeted toward provider-family barriers, such as health literacy. Patients with limited English proficiency or disabilities or who were receiving intensive care gained additional benefits. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric FCRs promote humanistic outcomes including increased empathy, partnership, respect, service, and communication. Limitations included difficulty in defining humanism, variable implementation, and inconsistent reporting of humanistic outcomes. Future efforts should include highlighting FCR's humanistic benefits, universal implementation, and adapting FCRs to pandemics such as coronavirus disease 2019.","Fernandes, Ashley K; Wilson, Sheria; Nalin, Ansel P; Philip, Andrew; Gruber, Laura; Kwizera, Elise; Sydelko, Bette S; Forbis, Shalini G; Lauden, Stephanie",Hosp. pediatr.

316873,Novel coronavirus and trauma surgery: successful infection control from a level I trauma centre,2020,"OBJECTIVE: During the first months of 2020, the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) spread rapidly and soon reached a pandemic level. With the increasing number of hospitalizations, medical and nursing personnel resources were soon inadequate. As a consequence, medical volunteers became a key human resource and young medical residents in any specialty were hired on a voluntary basis to contribute to take care of patients with COVID-19. This study reports on the lived experience of residents in child neuropsychiatry who volunteered in Italian hotspot COVID-19-designated hospitals during the epidemic outbreak. METHODS: A phenomenological, qualitative approach using semi-structured interviews with open-ended questions was used to obtain in-depth narratives of the experience of residents in child neuropsychiatry volunteering in North Italy COVID-19-designated hospitals. All residents (n = 8) participated in the study. Interviews were conducted by an expert researcher trained in qualitative methods. Data analysis was performed by independent coders. RESULTS: Five core themes could be identified from the interviews: acting as mediators on two fronts, facing the shock of COVID-19 reality, capitalizing from specialty education, growing as persons and professionals, and humanizing medical care. CONCLUSIONS: This study is unique in providing an in-depth understanding of the experience of young residents in child neuropsychiatry volunteering in general hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic in Northern Italy. The findings suggest that this experience may be highly beneficial for both the residents and the hospital quality of care. Insights for an accurate planning of residents' engagement in future healthcare emergencies are provided.","Parravicini, Stefano; Provenzi, Livio; Barello, Serena; Nania, Tiziana; Grumi, Serena; Rinaldi, Elisa; Orcesi, Simona; Borgatti, Renato",Acad. psychiatry,,495

320017,The Clinical Characteristics of Leukopenia in Patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus of Han Ethnicity in China: A Cross-Sectional Study,2021,"Introduction: In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, governments have implemented lockdown measures with large impact on lifestyle behaviors and well-being of children (including adolescents). The impact on children with severe obesity has not yet been described. These vulnerable children are plausibly at even larger risk for these adverse effects. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown measures on eating behaviors, physical activity, screen time and quality of life (QoL) of children with severe obesity. Methods: In this mixed-methods study, questionnaires and semi-structured telephone interviews were used to investigate the impact of COVID-19 (April 2020) on children with severe obesity (adult BMIequivalent ≥35kg/m2) under treatment at our obesity center. Three questionnaires, the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire-Child version, Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory, and Dutch Physical Activity Questionnaire, were filled out by their families pre-pandemic and during lockdown. Changes over time in percentile scores, time spent on physical activity and screen time were assessed. Qualitative analyses were performed according to the Grounded Theory. Results: In total, 83 families were included, of which 75 participated in telephone interviews. Their children's characteristics were mean age 11.5 years (SD 4.6), 52% female, mean BMI SD score 3.8 (SD 1.0). On group level, no changes in scores for emotional, restrained, external eating, and QoL as well as screen time were observed (δ scores +9.2, +3.9, +0.3;and +3.0, respectively;-0.3 hr/wk;all p-values &gt;0.05). Time spent on physical activity decreased (δ-1.9 hr/wk, p=0.02). We identified subgroups whose questionnaire scores improved or deteriorated during lockdown, which were associated with age, pre-existent psychosocial problems and pre-pandemic questionnaire scores. For example, children who did not fulfill WHO physical activity criteria pre-pandemic showed a further decline (from 2.8 to 0.7 h/wk, p=0.001). Children with high emotional and external eating scores during lockdown had the lowest QoL (p-values &lt;0.01). Qualitative data revealed that an increased demand for food by the child was frequently observed (n=21), mostly in children aged &lt;10 years (19/21). This was attributed to loss of daily structure, increased stress, or emotional eating. Families who reported no changes (n=15) or improved eating behaviors (n=11) attributed this to already existing strict eating schemes that they kept adhering to during lockdown. Conclusion: This study shows differential response profiles to the COVID-19 lockdown in children with severe obesity. Although on group level lifestyle scores tend to average out, a clinically relevant part of families reported a deterioration in physical activity and eating behaviors. Children with pre-existent psychosocial problems and high external or emotional eating scores were most at risk for the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Health care professionals should target these vulnerable children to minimize short-and long-term negative physical and mental health consequences.","Welling, M.

There is currently no proven effective drug treatment or prophylaxis for this coronavirus infection. While developing safe and effective vaccines is one of the key focuses, a number of existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for their potency and efficiency against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and in the clinic. Here, we review the significant potential of nitazoxanide (NTZ) as an antiviral agent that can be repurposed as a treatment for COVID-19. Originally, NTZ was developed as an antiparasitic agent especially against Cryptosporidium spp.; it was later shown to possess potent activity against a broad range of both RNA and DNA viruses, including influenza A, hepatitis B and C, and coronaviruses. Recent in vitro assessment of NTZ has confirmed its promising activity against SARS-CoV-2 with an EC50 of 2.12 µM. Here we examine its drug properties, antiviral activity against different viruses, clinical trials outcomes, and mechanisms of antiviral action from the literature in order to highlight the therapeutic potential for the treatment of COVID-19. Furthermore, in preliminary PK/PD analyses using clinical data reported in the literature, comparison of simulated TIZ (active metabolite of NTZ) exposures at two doses with the in vitro potency of NTZ against SARS-CoV-2 gives further support for drug repurposing with potential in combination chemotherapy approaches. The review concludes with details of second generation thiazolides under development that could lead to improved antiviral therapies for future indications.","Stachulski, Andrew V; Taujanskas, Joshua; Pate, Sophie L; Rajoli, Rajith K R; Aljayyoussi, Ghaith; Pennington, Shaun H; Ward, Stephen A; Hong, Weiqian David; Biagini, Giancarlo A; Owen, Andrew; Nixon, Gemma L; Leung, Suet C; O039,; Neill, Paul M",ACS infect. dis,,495

321437,Convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin for people with COVID-19: a living systematic review,2021,"Amelioration of immune overactivity during sepsis is key to restoring hemodynamics, microvascular blood flow, and tissue oxygenation, and in preventing multi-organ dysfunction syndrome. The systemic inflammatory response syndrome that results from sepsis ultimately leads to degradation of the endothelial glycocalyx and subsequently increased vascular leakage. Current fluid resuscitation techniques only transiently improve outcomes in sepsis, and can cause edema. Nitric oxide (NO) treatment for sepsis has shown promise in the past, but implementation is difficult due to the challenges associated with delivery and the transient nature of NO. To address this, we tested the anti-inflammatory efficacy of sustained delivery of exogenous NO using i.v. infused NO releasing nanoparticles (NO-np). The impact of NO-np on microhemodynamics and immune response in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced endotoxemia mouse model was evaluated. NO-np treatment significantly attenuated the pro-inflammatory response by promoting M2 macrophage repolarization, which reduced the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the serum and slowed vascular extravasation. Combined, this resulted in significantly improved microvascular blood flow and 72-h survival of animals treated with NO-np. The results from this study suggest that sustained supplementation of endogenous NO ameliorates and may prevent the morbidities of acute systemic inflammatory conditions. Given that endothelial dysfunction is a common denominator in many acute inflammatory conditions, it is likely that NO enhancement strategies may be useful for the treatment of sepsis and other acute inflammatory insults that trigger severe systemic pro-inflammatory responses and often result in a cytokine storm, as seen in COVID-19.","Williams, Alexander T; Muller, Cynthia R; Govender, Krianthan; Navati, Mahantesh S; Friedman, Adam J; Friedman, Joel M; Cabrales, Pedro",Free Radic Biol Med,,495
321884,The Uncertain Role of Corticosteroids in the Treatment of COVID-19,2020,"To control the spread of COVID-19, governments in different countries and regions implemented various types of lockdown and outdoor restrictions. The research aimed to describe and compare the health status of Chinese people both domestically and abroad in this global health crisis. An online questionnaire survey was distributed to Chinese mainland citizens living in Hubei (the lockdown province), outside Hubei, and those living abroad in 2020. A total of 1000 respondents were recruited and reported worse health status compared with Chinese population norms. People living in Hubei reported worse health status than those living outside Hubei but revealed better health status than overseas respondents. It was clear that the pandemic as well as strict lockdown and outdoor restriction policies affected Chinese people's health. It is important for the Chinese government to be aware of the negative impact of such strict policies and to take measures to reduce the panic of society when implementing similar policies in the future. It also implies that governments in other countries should promote social support for those who live far from home and actively call for support for non-discriminatory attitudes toward ethnic minorities.","Mao, Zhuxin; Chen, Bohao; Wang, Wei; Kind, Paul; Wang, Pei",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,495

Methods: An analytical study comparing clinical outcome of confirmed COVID-19 with suspected COVID-19 pregnant women was carried out during three-month period from 1st July to 30th September 2020 at COVID-19 ward on pregnant women of Sir Ganga Ram Hospital Lahore. Information including clinical features, obstetrical outcome, ventilatory support and mortality was collected on a predesigned Proforma. The data were analyzed by using SPSS version 24. Qualitative data were expressed as frequency, percentages and chi-square, While quantitative variables as mean +/- SD. Results: Eighty-three patients were enrolled, including 41 confirmed and 42 suspected COVID-19 cases. The mean age was 28.59 years +/- 4.9. The mean gestational age on admission was 31.98 weeks. Obstetrical complications included miscarriage in 5 (11.6%) cases, preterm labor in 5 (11.6%), PPROM in 1 (2.3%) and IUD in 2 (4.7%) in COVID-19 suspect group. A total of 17/41 confirmed and 19/42 suspected COVID-19 were delivered during the study mostly through caesarean section.

324405,Effectiveness of ozone therapy in addition to conventional treatment on mortality in patients with COVID-19,2021,"Abstract: SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus responsible for the pandemic that developed in China in late 2019. Transmission of the virus is predominantly direct, through exposure to infected respiratory secretions. As far as we know, arthropods play a key role in the transmission and spread of several viruses, and thus their role in the spread of COVID-19 deserves to be studied. The biological transmission of viral agents through insects is very complex. While mechanical transmission is more likely to happen, biological transmission is possible via blood-sucking arthropods, but this requires a high grade of compatibility between the vector and the pathogen. If the biological and mechanical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by blood-sucking arthropods is excluded, a mechanical transmission by urban pests could take place. This risk is very low but it could be important in isolated environmental conditions, where other means of transmission are not possible. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in non-blood-sucking arthropods in infected buildings, like hospitals and retirement homes, should be investigated.","Dutto, M; Lauria, G; Drago, A; Martini, S; Gorrasi, I; Gilli, G",Ann. ig,,495

325796,Clinical analysis of second-trimester pregnancy termination after previous caesarean delivery in 51 patients with placenta previa and placenta accreta spectrum: a retrospective study,2021,"Purpose: Knee injury has been established as a risk factor for developing osteoarthritis. It is not known if post-traumatic osteoarthritis can be prevented or delayed following a knee injury. It has been established that symptoms (e.g., knee-related pain, stiffness, locking etc.) and functional deficits (i.e., quadriceps weakness, balance, hopping performance) can persist for years following an intra-articular knee injury. We hypothesized that a neuromuscular training program that targets quadriceps strength and frontal plane knee control could improve knee-related symptoms in young adults 3 to 15 years after an injury. Furthermore, it is possible that improved function could reduce the risk or delay the onset of osteoarthritis, the illness. The purpose of this study was to describe the effect of pilot 8-week physiotherapist-led neuromuscular training intervention on self-reported knee symptoms in individuals with a 3 to 15-year history of a youth sport-related intra- articular knee injury. Methods: This is a preliminary analysis of a pilot stepped-wedge randomized controlled trial. Participants include a sub-sample of the Alberta Youth Prevention of Early Osteoarthritis (PrE-OA) historical cohort who experienced a time-loss, medical attention youth sport-related intra-articular injury 3-15 years previously. The present study is limited to the participants who completed their baseline testing before the in-person testing and exercise intervention were cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic. After providing informed consent and completing a baseline Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) questionnaire, participants were randomly assigned to immediate (intervention) and 8-week delayed (control) groups in permuted blocks of varying size and stratified during randomization by sex. To ensure allocation concealment, the trial biostatistician, who was not involved in participant recruitment or the intervention, generated the randomization sequence. The allocation was concealed in a computer file only accessible by the biostatistician and a designated research assistant. Once the baseline KOOS was completed, the physiotherapist leading the intervention contacted the research assistant who provided the randomization information. As a result, the study physiotherapist (AMR) was not blinded to group status. The KOOS was repeated at 8-weeks. The 8-week intervention consisted of twice weekly 60-minute physiotherapist-led group exercise classes and once weekly 30-minute independent home exercise session. Exercise classes were delivered in a multi-purpose room at the University of Calgary using standard exercise equipment (e.g., step boards, mats, 5-15 pound dumbbells). Each class consisted of a warm-up, three sets of seven exercises (i.e., squats, single-leg squats, lunges, jumping and landing, hip adductor strength, hamstring strength, trunk control), followed by five minutes of exercises addressing additional functional movement patterns (e.g. lateral movements, deceleration). Each exercise had 4 to 6 levels of progression. Decision to progress to the next level was shared between the physiotherapist and the participant. Knee-related pain was monitored at the beginning and end of each class and 24 hours following the class. The primary outcome was the change in KOOS Symptoms subscale score from baseline to 8-week intervention/delay. This subscale is comprised of 7 questions, each scored on 5-point Likert scale, ranging from no problems to extreme problems. The scores were totalled and the total was transformed to a 0-100 scale with higher scores indicating better outcome. Between-group differences in KOOS symptoms change were assessed with the Mann-Whitney U test (p &lt; 0.05). Results: Nineteen participants were recruited and randomized to immediate (n=10) and delayed (n=9) exercise program delivery. One participant dropped out of the immediate delivery and three participants in the delayed delivery group were unable to participate in the follow-up testing due to COVID-19-related restrictions. Fifteen participant were included in the analysis. Nine participants (6 women, 3 men;age 27.6±3.2 years;height 170.2±9.6 cm;weight 86.5±17.7 kg;body mass index 30.1±7.2) completed the 8-week intervention and 6 participants (3 women, 3 men;age 25.7±2.2 years;height 176.1±8.3 cm;weight 82.2±11.2 kg;body mass index 26.5±2.3) in the delayed group served as controls. Scores for the KOOS subscales are presented in Table 1. The median change in symptoms from baseline to 8-week follow-up was -3.6 (range -10.7 to 3.6) in the immediate and -1.8 (range -3.6 to 3.6) in the delayed group. There was no statistically significant difference (p=0.22, Z= -1.33) in the change in the symptom score between those completing the intervention and the delayed group over the 8-week period. The change in the KOOS Symptom subscale for each participant is presented in Figure 1. Conclusions: There were no differences found between groups when comparing change in knee-related symptoms in individuals 3-15 following an intra-articular knee injury after an 8-week exercise intervention, compared to those waiting for the intervention. Some individuals reported more knee-related symptoms after the intervention, even though the exercises were adapted for individual needs and pain was monitored. It is important to bear in mind that the change in the KOOS symptoms score in both groups is less than the Minimal Detectable Change that previous studies have reported to be 5 to 8.5 points in populations with knee injury. It is possible that the increased focus on the knee during the study leads to decreased scores in knee-related symptoms at follow-up. It should also be taken into consideration that it is possible that the 8-week intervention is too short to elicit positive changes in knee-related symptoms. In the future, the impact of an exercise intervention on knee-related symptoms will be explored in a larger group to allow for more robust analysis in which potentially confounding factors can be considered (e.g., time since injury, sex).

As a complimentary tool, chest CT has been shown to be able to reveal visual patterns characteristic for COVID-19, which has definite value at several stages during the disease course. To facilitate CT analysis, recent efforts have focused on computer-aided characterization and diagnosis, which has shown promising results. However, domain shift of data across clinical data centers poses a serious challenge when deploying learning-based models. In this work, we attempt to find a solution for this challenge via federated and semi-supervised learning. A multi-national database consisting of 1704 scans from three countries is adopted to study the performance gap, when training a model with one dataset and applying it to another. Expert radiologists manually delineated 945 scans for COVID-19 findings. In handling the variability in both the data and annotations, a novel federated semi-supervised learning technique is proposed to fully utilize all available data (with or without annotations). Federated learning avoids the need for sensitive data-sharing, which makes it favorable for institutions and nations with strict regulatory policy on data privacy. Moreover, semi-supervision potentially reduces the annotation burden under a distributed setting. The proposed framework is shown to be effective compared to fully supervised scenarios with conventional data sharing instead of model weight sharing.","Yang, Dong; Xu, Ziyue; Li, Wenqi; Myronenko, Andriy; Roth, Holger R.; Harmon, Stephanie; Xu, Sheng; Turkbey, Baris; Turkbey, Evrim; Wang, Xiaosong; Zhu, Wentao; Carrafiello, Gianpaolo; Patella, Francesca; Cariati, Maurizio; Obinata, Hirofumi; Mori, Hitoshi; Tamura, Kaku; An, Peng; Wood, Bradford J.; Xu, Daguang",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.11750v1.pdf,495

329081,Advances in Neurostimulation for Chronic Pain Disorders,2020,"The emergence and rapid global spread of SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates the importance of infectious disease surveillance, particularly during the early stages. Viral genomes can provide key insights into transmission chains and pathogenicity. Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from thirty-two of the first SARS-CoV-2 positive cases (March 18-30) in Kingston Ontario, Canada. Viral genomes were sequenced using Ion Torrent (n = 24) and MinION (n = 27) sequencing platforms. SARS-CoV-2 genomes carried forty-six polymorphic sites including two missense and three synonymous variants in the spike protein gene. The D614G point mutation was the predominate viral strain in our cohort (92.6%). A heterozygous variant (C9994A) was detected by both sequencing platforms but filtered by the ARTIC network bioinformatic pipeline suggesting that heterozygous variants may be underreported in the SARS-CoV-2 literature. Phylogenetic analysis with 87,738 genomes in the GISAID database identified global origins and transmission events including multiple, international introductions as well as community spread. Reported travel history validated viral introduction and transmission inferred by phylogenetic analysis. Molecular epidemiology and evolutionary phylogenetics may complement contact tracing and help reconstruct transmission chains of emerging diseases. Earlier detection and screening in this way could improve the effectiveness of regional public health interventions to limit future pandemics.","Sjaarda, Calvin P; Rustom, Nazneen; Evans, Gerald A; Huang, David; Perez-Patrigeon, Santiago; Hudson, Melissa L; Wong, Henry; Sun, Zhengxin; Guan, T Hugh; Ayub, Muhammad; Soares, Claudio N; Colautti, Robert I; Sheth, Prameet M",Sci Rep,,495

However, little is known about the impact of these measures on the population as expressed on social media from different cultural contexts. OBJECTIVE: To assess and compare the evolution of the topics discussed on Chinese and French social media during the COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS: We extracted posts containing ""COVID-19""- or ""lockdown""-related keywords in the most commonly used micro-blogging social media platforms, i.e., Weibo (China) and Twitter (France), from one week before to the lifting of the lockdown. A topic model was applied independently for three periods: pre-lockdown, early lockdown and mid-to-late lockdown, to assess the evolution of the topics discussed on Chinese and French social media. RESULTS: 6 395, 23 422 and 141 643 Chinese Weibo messages, and 34 327, 119 919, and 282 965 French tweets were extracted in the pre-lockdown, early lockdown and mid-to-late lockdown periods in China and France, respectively. Four categories of topics were discussed in a continuously evolving way in all three periods: epidemic news and everyday life, scientific information, public measures and solidarity & encouragement. The most represented category over all periods in both countries was epidemic news and everyday life. Scientific information was far more discussed on Weibo than in French tweets. Misinformation circulated through social media in both countries; however, it was more concerned with the virus and epidemic in China, whereas it was more concerned with the lockdown measures in France. Regarding public measures, more criticisms were identified in French tweets than on Weibo. Advantages and data privacy concerns regarding tracing apps were also addressed in French tweets. All these differences were explained by the different use of social media, the different timeline of the epidemic and the different cultural context in these two countries. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to compare the social media content in Eastern and Western countries during the unprecedented COVID-19 lockdown. Using general COVID-19-related social media data, our results describe common and different public reactions, behaviors and concerns in China and France, covering even the fine topics identified in prior studies focusing on specific interests. We believe our study can help characterize country-specific public needs and appropriately address them during an outbreak.","Schück, Stéphane; Foulquié, Pierre; Mebarki, Adel; Faviez, Carole; Khadhar, Mickaïl; Texier, Nathalie; Katsahian, Sandrine; Burgun, Anita; Chen, Xiaoyi",,,495

332617,Telehealth in COVID-19 and Cardiovascular Disease-Ensuring Equitable Care,2020,"COVID-19 has created significant strain on the supply of healthcare resources and, during the spring surge in New York City, many hospitals prepared resource allocation policies should the demand for ventilators exceed supply. In such circumstances, resources should remain allocated to patients most likely to survive. Understanding how these guidelines perform is an important consideration in disaster planning. Numerous allocation guidelines exist however nearly all utilize a Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. We sought to evaluate the performance of ventilator reallocation by applying the New York State Ventilator Allocation Guidelines (NYVAG) to a large cohort of COVID-19 patients. Our retrospective cohort included 895 intubated COVID-19 patients admitted to an academic system in New York City. SOFA scores were calculated for every day of mechanical ventilation. Per NYVAG, patients would have their ventilator reallocated at 48 hours if their interval SOFA score increased, did not change from an initial SOFA of 8-11, or was greater than 11. At 120 hours it would be reallocated if their SOFA score worsened or was greater than 7. At 168 hours and every subsequent 48 hours it would be reallocated if their SOFA score worsened. Ventilator reallocation was simulated and no reallocation was made for any patient. The average SOFA (n=895) at the time of intubation was 7.1 ± 3.6. At the 48-hour reassessment (average SOFA 8.2 ± 3.6, n=759), 436 (57%) patients would have their ventilator reallocated, 145 (33%) of whom would later survive to discharge. At the 120-hour reassessment (average SOFA 7.8 ± 3.6, n=264) 173 (66%) of the 264 remaining simulated ventilated patients would have their ventilators reallocated, 83 (48%) of whom would later survive to discharge. At the 168-hour reassessment (average SOFA 7.8 ± 3.6, n=80) 66 (83%) of the 80 simulated remaining ventilated patients would have their ventilators reallocated. Overall, 685 patients (77%) of the starting cohort would have had their ventilator reallocated at some time during the first 168 hours of mechanical ventilation, 268 (40%) of whom survived to discharge. Our simulated study found that the application of NYVAG to the COVID-19 surge at one academic system would have resulted in a significant portion of ventilated patients having had their ventilators reallocated. This may be deeply concerning as a significant portion of patients ultimately survived to discharge. These results call for further confirmatory studies and have implications for optimal resource allocation strategies during pandemics.","Walsh, B.

334015,Onsite telemedicine strategy for coronavirus (COVID-19) screening to limit exposure in ED,2020,"BACKGROUND: Infectious diseases are a leading cause of hospitalization during childhood. The various mitigation strategies implemented to control the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic could have additional, unintended benefits for limiting the spread of other infectious diseases and their associated burden on the health care system. METHODS: We conducted an interrupted time-series analysis using population-wide hospitalization data for the state of Victoria, Australia. Infection-related hospitalizations for children and adolescents (aged <18 years, total source population â¼1.4 million) were extracted using pre-defined International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision Australian Modification (ICD-10-AM) codes. The change in weekly hospitalization rates (incidence rate ratio, IRR) for all infections following the introduction of pandemic-related restrictions from 15 March 2020 was estimated. RESULTS: Over 2015-19, the mean annual incidence of hospitalization with infection among children less than 18 years was 37 per 1000 population. There was an estimated 65% (95% CI 62-67%) reduction in the incidence of overall infection-related hospitalizations associated with the introduction of pandemic restrictions. The reduction was most marked in younger children (at least 66% in those less than 5 years of age) and for lower respiratory tract infections (relative reduction 85%, 95% CI 85-86%). CONCLUSIONS: The wider impacts of pandemic mitigation strategies on non-COVID-19 infection-related hospitalizations are poorly understood. We observed marked and rapid decreases in hospitalized childhood infection. In tandem with broader consequences, sustainable measures, such as improved hand hygiene, could reduce the burden of severe childhood infection post-pandemic and the social and economic costs of hospitalization.","Todd, Isobel M F; Miller, Jessica E; Rowe, Stacey L; Burgner, David P; Sullivan, Sheena G",Int. j. epidemiol,,495

The severity and mortality of the disease is associated with a high level of release of cytokine in the patients which is known as CRS (cytokine release syndrome) or cytokine storm syndrome. IL-6 is a type of pro-inflammatory cytokine which release in the severe COVID-19 patients. This cytokine initiates CRS the JAK-STAT or MAPK/NF-&#954;B-IL-6 pathway. Tocilizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, is designed to bind both mIL-6R (membrane bound receptor for IL-6) and sIL-6R (soluble receptor for IL-6) and inhibit the JAK-STAT or MAPK/NF-&#954;B-IL-6 signaling pathway. It finally stops the cytokine storm syndrome. However, we need to understand that how tocilizumab is bound with mIL-6R or sIL-6R. Similarly, we also need to understand more about the real molecular mechanism of activity of tocilizumab.","Saha, Abinit; Sharma, Ashish Ranjan; Bhattacharya, Manojit; Sharma, Garima; Lee, Sang-Soo; Chakraborty, Chiranjib",Arch Med Res,,495
334394,Factors Contributing to Missing COVID-19 Cases During Contact Tracing,2021,"COVID-19 has emerged as a global pandemic. It is mainly manifested as pneumonia which may deteriorate into severe respiratory failure. The major hallmark of the disease is the systemic inflammatory immune response characterized by Cytokine Storm (CS). CS is marked by elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines, mainly interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, IL-10, tumour necrosis factor-&#945; (TNF-&#945;) and interferon-Î³ (IFN-Î³). Of these, IL-6 is found to be significantly associated with higher mortality. IL-6 is also a robust marker for predicting disease prognosis and deterioration of clinical profile. In this review, the pivotal role played by IL-6 in the immuno-pathology of COVID-19 has been illustrated. The role of IL-6 as a pleiotropic cytokine executing both pro and anti-inflammatory activities has been reviewed. ADAM 10, a metalloproteinase switches the anti-inflammatory pathway of IL-6 to pro inflammatory hence blocking the action of ADAM 10 could be a new therapeutic strategy to mitigate the proinflammatory action of IL-6. Furthermore, we explore the role of anti-IL6 agents, IL-6 receptor antibodies which were being used for autoimmune diseases but now are being repurposed for the therapy of COVID-19.","Shekhawat, Jyoti; Gauba, Kavya; Gupta, Shruti; Purohit, Purvi; Mitra, Prasenjit; Garg, Mahendra; Misra, Sanjeev; Sharma, Praveen; Banerjee, Mithu",Indian J Clin Biochem,,495

Here, we tested the hypothesis that changes in fixation stability induced by peripheral viewing contribute to crowding in peripheral vision by increasing positional uncertainty. We first assessed whether fixation was less stable during peripheral versus central (foveal) viewing for both crowded and uncrowded stimuli. We then tested whether fixation stability during peripheral viewing was associated with the extent of crowding. Fourteen participants performed a tumbling E orientation discrimination task at three different eccentricities (0°, 5°, 10°). The target was presented with or without flankers. Fixational eye movements were measured using an infrared video-based eyetracker. A central fixation cross was provided for the two peripheral viewing conditions, and optotype size was scaled for each eccentricity. Discrimination of appropriately scaled uncrowded stimuli was unaffected by eccentricity, whereas discrimination of crowded stimuli deteriorated dramatically with eccentricity, despite scaling. Both crowded and uncrowded peripheral stimuli were associated with reduced fixation stability, increased microsaccadic amplitude, and a greater proportion of horizontal microsaccades relative to centrally presented stimuli. However, these effects were not associated with the magnitude of crowding. This suggests that reduced fixation stability due to peripheral viewing does not contribute to crowding in peripheral vision.","Raveendran, Rajkumar Nallour; Krishnan, Arun Kumar; Thompson, Benjamin",J Vis,,495

Whilst the number of infection-induced deaths in Ghana, West Africa are minimal when compared with the rest of the world, the impact on the local health service is still significant. Compartmental models are a useful framework for investigating transmission of diseases in societies. To understand how the infection will spread and how to limit the outbreak. We have developed a modified SEIR compartmental model with nine compartments (CoVCom9) to describe the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Ghana. We have carried out a detailed mathematical analysis of the CoVCom9, including the derivation of the basic reproduction number, $\mathcal{R}_{0}$. In particular, we have shown that the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable when $\mathcal{R}_{0}<1$ via a candidate Lyapunov function. Using the SARS-CoV-2 reported data for confirmed-positive cases and deaths from March 13 to August 10, 2020, we have parametrised the CoVCom9 model. The results of this fit show good agreement with data. We used Latin hypercube sampling-rank correlation coefficient (LHS-PRCC) to investigate the uncertainty and sensitivity of $\mathcal{R}_{0}$ since the results derived are significant in controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2. We estimate that over this five month period, the basic reproduction number is given by $\mathcal{R}_{0} = 3.110$, with the 95\% confidence interval being $2.042 \leq \mathcal{R}_0 \leq 3.240$, and the mean value being $\mathcal{R}_{0}=2.623$. Of the 32 parameters in the model, we find that just six have a significant influence on $\mathcal{R}_{0}$, these include the rate of testing, where an increasing testing rate contributes to the reduction of $\mathcal{R}_{0}$.","Acheampong, Edward; Okyere, Eric; Iddi, Samuel; Bonney, Joseph H.

The purpose of this study is to compile all the available literature and published guideline to facilitate the patient management. Materials and methods: PubMed, Scopus, and Google scholar database were systematically searched using the search terms “COVID-19” AND “pediatric” AND “urology”. All published papers retrieved from this search were considered for this review based on PRISMA guidelines. In addition to this, World Wide Web search was conducted for guidelines, and recommendations published by scientific societies and their websites were searched for the desired information. Results: Total eight articles and society recommendations met the inclusion criteria and included in the study. The general level of agreement was found on need to postpone the elective cases and ensuring the safety of hospital staff. The organ and life-threatening conditions like acute and symptomatic obstructive uropathy and testicular torsion should be treated on an emergent basis irrespective of COVID status. There is no evidence that any modality either open or laparoscopic has any advantage over the other. The protocols need to be modified based on stage of pandemic, availability of resources, and local guidelines. The restart of work once the pandemic is over should also be prioritised.

This raises important questions such as ""Whether there are differences based on gender in risk and severity of infection or mortality rate?"" and ""What are the biological explanation and mechanisms underlying these differences?"" Emerging evidences have proposed sex-based immunological, genetic, and hormonal differences to explain this ambiguity. Besides biological differences, women have also faced social inequities and economic hardships due to this pandemic. Several recent studies have shown that independent of age males are at higher risk for severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Although susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 was found to be similar across both genders in several disease cohorts, a disproportionate death ratio in men can be partly explained by the higher burden of pre-existing diseases and occupational exposures among men. At immunological point of view, females can engage a more active immune response, which may protect them and counter infectious diseases as compared to men. This attribute of better immune responses towards pathogens is thought to be due to high estrogen levels in females. Here we review the current knowledge about sex differences in susceptibility, the severity of infection and mortality, host immune responses, and the role of sex hormones in COVID-19 disease.","Patil, Ashlesh; Tripathy, Jaya Prasad; Deshmukh, Vishwajit; Sontakke, Bharat; Tripathi, Satyendra C",Monaldi arch. chest dis,,495

DESIGN: National survey. SETTING: UK maternity services during the COVID-19 pandemic. POPULATION OR SAMPLE: Healthcare professionals working within maternity services. METHODS: A national electronic survey was developed to investigate local modifications to general and specialist maternity care during the COVID-19 pandemic, in the context of the contemporaneous national pandemic guidance. After a pilot phase, the survey was distributed through professional networks by the RCOG and co-authors. The survey results were presented descriptively in tabular and graphic formats, with proportions compared using chi-squared tests. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Service modifications made during the pandemic. RESULTS: 81 respondent sites, 42% of 194 obstetric units in the UK, were included. They reported substantial and heterogeneous maternity service modifications. 70% of units reported a reduction in antenatal appointments and 56% in postnatal appointments; 89% reported using remote consultation methods. 70% reported a change to screening pathways for gestational diabetes mellitus. 59% had temporarily removed the offer of births at home or in a midwife-led unit. 86% of units experienced a reduction in emergency antenatal presentations. CONCLUSIONS: This national survey documents the extensive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on maternity services in the UK. More research is needed to understand the impact on maternity outcomes and experience.","Jardine, Jennifer; Relph, Sophie; Magee, Laura A; von Dadelszen, Peter; Morris, Edward; Ross-Davie, Mary; Draycott, Tim; Khalil, Asma",BJOG,,495
342379,Advocate for regional anesthesia in the corona pandemic?,2020,"Biochemical and structural analyses suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is well-adapted to infecting humans and the presence of four residues (PRRA) at the S1/S2 site within the spike (S) protein, which may lead to unexpected tissue or host tropism. Here we report that SARS-CoV-2 efficiently utilized ACE2 of 9 species to infect 293T cells. Similarly, pseudoviruses bearing S protein derived from either the bat RaTG13 or pangolin GX, two closely related animal coronaviruses, utilized ACE2 of a diverse range of animal species to gain entry. Removal of PRRA from SARS-CoV-2 S protein displayed distinct effects on pseudoviral entry into different cell types. Unexpectedly, insertion of PRRA into the RaTG13 S protein selectively abrogated the usage of horseshoe bat and pangolin ACE2 but enhanced the usage of mouse ACE2 by the relevant pseudovirus to enter cells. Together, our findings identified a previously unrecognized effect of the PRRA insert on SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 S proteins.ImportanceThe four-residue insert (PRRA) at the boundary between the S1and S2 subunits of SARS-CoV-2 has been widely recognized since day 1 for its role in SARS-CoV-2 S protein processing and activation. As this PRRA insert is unique to SARS-CoV-2 among group b betacoronaviruses, it is thought to affect the tissue and species tropism of SARS-CoV-2. We compared the usage of 10 ACE2 orthologs and found that the presence of PRRA not only affects the cellular tropism of SARS-CoV-2 but also modulates the usage of ACE2 orthologs by the closely related bat RaTG13 S protein. The binding of pseudovirions carrying RaTG13 S with a PRRA insert to mouse ACE2 was nearly 2-fold higher than that of pseudovirions carrying RaTG13 S.","Liu, Shufeng; Selvaraj, Prabhuanand; Lien, Christopher Z; Nunez, Ivette A; Wu, Wells W; Chou, Chao-Kai; Wang, Tony T",J. virol,,495

Here, we hypothesize that a single large dose of vitamin D (Vit D) could be an option for trial in COVID-19. Vit D deficiency or insufficiency is very common in the general population as well as in patients with COVID-19. It has been shown that low Vit D level is associated with viral infection, and Vit D supplementation is beneficial for people infected with viruses, such as HIV and hepatitis C virus. Although COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, the morbidity and mortality of this disease are driven by coagulopathy. Clinical studies have shown that Vit D can exert anticoagulant effects. Vit D, a lipid-soluble vitamin, can be administered as a draught. Vit D supplementation is safe and has rare toxic events. In addition, the cost of Vit D is fairly low. Based on these observations, we speculate that a single dose of 300,000 IU Vit D may have a role in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.","Liu, Guoqiang; Hong, Tianpei; Yang, Jin",Drug Des Devel Ther,,495

This research aimed to compare the performance of 2 antinucleocapsid assays. METHODS: Serum from 49 HCWs was analysed at baseline and 6 months using the Abbott diagnostics SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay and the Roche Diagnostics Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 total antibody assay. RESULTS: At baseline, 14/49 participants (29%) demonstrated antibody reactivity using the Abbott assay. At 6 months, 4/14 participants (29%) continued to demonstrate reactivity. A total of 14/49 (29%) participants had detectable antibodies at baseline using the Roche assay. In total, 13/14 (93%) of participants demonstrated antibody reactivity at 6 months. The Abbott assay showed a statistically significant difference in the signal-to-threshold values of baseline reactive samples when repeated at 6 months (p = 0.001). This was not seen with the Roche assay (p = 0.51). CONCLUSION: In this small study, the Roche Diagnostics Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 total antibody assay appears superior in performance to the Abbott diagnostics SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay in accurately detecting participants with a history of confirmed COVID-19 disease at 6 months follow-up. This finding should be born in mind in the planning of future seroprevalence studies, especially when considering the use of anti-nucleocapsid assays.","Kerr, Colm; Allen, Niamh; Hughes, Gerry; Kelly, Martina; O039,; Rourke, Fiona; Lynagh, Yvonne; Dunne, Jean; Crowley, Brendan; Conlon, Niall; Bergin, Colm",Ir. j. med. sci,,495

To address that issue, we performed a meta-analysis following The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Searches of the Embase, MEDLINE, PubMed, and Cochrane Library databases identified 16 case-control studies examining the effect of ACEI/ARB on the incidence of COVID-19 and its severity. ACEI/ARB usage was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 morbidity (odds ratio (OR) 1.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07-1.33, P=0.001) among the general population but not in a hypertensive population (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.90-1.21, P=0.553). ACEI/ARB usage was not associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 morbidity (coefficient 1.00, 95% CI 1.00-1.00, P=0.660) when we adjusted for hypertension in the general population. ACEI/ARB usage was also not associated with an increased risk of severe illness (OR 0.90, 95%CI 0.55-1.47, P=0.664) or mortality (OR 1.43, 95%CI 0.972.10, P=0.070) in COVID-19 patients.

This is particularly challenging for less-represented disciplines, such as ophthalmology. We designed a red eye clinical reasoning case for preclinical medical students, which can be delivered virtually, using video conference software. Methods: We developed a 90-minute red eye/clinical reasoning workshop for which prereading was assigned to students. We then delivered a virtual development session to nonophthalmologist copreceptors and provided a session faculty guide. The entire first-year medical student class (No. = 140) participated in one of four identical workshops, which included virtual small- and large-group discussions. Students completed a knowledge pre- and posttest, and an optional session postsurvey. Results: Knowledge gains from pretest (No. = 94) to posttest (No. = 73) were statistically significant (p < .05), with average scores improving from 57% to 70%. Overall, students were satisfied, rating the following items 4 or 5 out of 5: session (86%, No. = 31), virtual format (83%, No. = 30), and if they recommended future use (69%, No. = 35). Discussion: This novel, virtual clinical reasoning case simulated small- and large-group learning, achieved knowledge gains, and was well received by students. Minor technical challenges were encountered but successfully remedied, without apparent disruption to learning. This virtual medical education model can be used to enhance ophthalmology education in preclinical medical students and can be adapted for virtual design of other curricular content.","Chadha, Nisha; Fredrick, Douglas; Malbari, Alefiyah; Hojsak, Joanne",MedEdPORTAL,,495

As this human pandemic virus has spread across the world, the potential impacts of SARS-CoV-2 on native North American bat populations are unknown, as is the ability of North American bats to serve as reservoirs or intermediate hosts able to transmit the virus to humans or to other animal species. To help determine the impacts of the pandemic virus on North American bat populations, we experimentally challenged big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) with SARS-CoV-2 under BSL-3 conditions. We inoculated the bats both oropharyngeally and nasally, and over the ensuing three weeks we measured infectivity, pathology, virus concentrations in tissues, oral and rectal virus excretion, virus transmission, and clinical signs of disease. We found no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in any examined bat, including no viral excretion, no transmission, no detectable virus in tissues, and no signs of disease or pathology. Based on our findings it appears that big brown bats are resistant to infection with the SARS-CoV-2. The potential susceptibility of other North American bat species to SARS-CoV-2 remains to be investigated.","Hall, Jeffrey S; Knowles, Susan; Nashold, Sean W; Ip, Hon S; Leon, Ariel E; Rocke, Tonie; Keller, Saskia; Carossino, Mariano; Balasuriya, Udeni; Hofmeister, Erik",Transbound. emerg. dis.

Self-transcendence values, emphasizing care for close others, society, and nature, decreased by late 2020. These changes were amplified among individuals worrying about the pandemic. The results support psychological theory of values as usually stable, but also an adaptive system that responds to significant changes in environmental conditions.

The health department of the fourth largest city in the U.S. recognized that sound estimates of viral impact were needed to inform decision-making. METHODS: Adapting standardized disaster research methodology in September 2020, the city was divided into high and low strata based on RT-PCR positivity rates, and census block groups within each stratum were randomly selected with probability proportional to size, followed by random selection of households within each group. Using two immunoassays, the proportion of infected individuals was estimated for the city, as well as by positivity rate and by sociodemographic and other characteristics. The degree of under ascertainment of seroprevalence was estimated based on RT-PCR positive cases. RESULTS: Seroprevalence was estimated to be 14% with a near two-fold difference in areas with high (18%) versus low (10%) RT-PCR positivity rates and was four times higher compared to case-based surveillance data. CONCLUSIONS: Seroprevalence was higher than previously reported and is greater than that estimated from RT-PCR data. Results will be used to inform public health decisions about testing, outreach, and vaccine rollout.","Symanski, Elaine; Ensor, Katherine B; Piedra, Pedro A; Sheth, Komal; Caton, Kelsey; Williams, Stephen L; Persse, David; Banerjee, Deborah; Hopkins, Loren",J. infect. dis,,495

The network based on progressive upsampling for COVID-CT super-resolution increases the reconstruction error. This paper proposes a progressive back-projection network (PBPN) for COVID-CT super-resolution to solve this problem. METHODS: In this paper, we propose a progressive back-projection network (PBPN) for COVID-CT super-resolution. PBPN is divided into two stages, and each stage consists of back-projection, deep feature extraction and upscaling. We design an up-projection and down-projection residual module to minimize the reconstruction error and construct a residual attention module to extract deep features. In each stage, firstly, PBPN performs back-projection to extract shallow features by two up-projection and down-projection residual modules; then, PBPN extracts deep features from the shallow features by two residual attention modules; finally, PBPN upsamples the deep features through sub-pixel convolution. RESULTS: The proposed method achieves the improvements of about 0.14~0.47 dB/0.0012~0.0060 for × 2 scale factor, 0.02~0.08 dB/0.0024~0.0059 for × 3 scale factor, and 0.08~0.41 dB/ 0.0040~0.0147 for × 4 scale factor than state-of-the-art methods (Bicubic, SRCNN, FSRCNN, VDSR, LapSRN, DRCN and DSRN) in terms of PSNR/SSIM on benchmark datasets. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed mehtod obtains better performance for COVID-CT super-resolution and reconstructs high-quality high-resolution COVID-CT images that contain more details and edges.","Song, Zhaoyang; Zhao, Xiaoqiang; Hui, Yongyong; Jiang, Hongmei",Comput Methods Programs Biomed,,495

Population-level dynamics of COVID-19 can generally be described using a set of ordinary differential equations, but these deterministic equations are insufficient for modeling the observed case rates, which can vary due to local testing and case reporting policies and non-homogeneous behavior among individuals. To assess the impact of population mobility on the spread of COVID-19, we have developed a novel Bayesian time-varying coefficient state-space model for infectious disease transmission. The foundation of this model is a time-varying coefficient compartment model to recapitulate the dynamics among susceptible, exposed, undetected infectious, detected infectious, undetected removed, detected non-infectious, detected recovered, and detected deceased individuals. The infectiousness and detection parameters are modeled to vary by time, and the infectiousness component in the model incorporates information on multiple sources of population mobility. Along with this compartment model, a multiplicative process model is introduced to allow for deviation from the deterministic dynamics. We apply this model to observed COVID-19 cases and deaths in several US states and Colorado counties. We find that population mobility measures are highly correlated with transmission rates and can explain complicated temporal variation in infectiousness in these regions. Additionally, the inferred connections between mobility and epidemiological parameters, varying across locations, have revealed the heterogeneous effects of different policies on the dynamics of COVID-19.","Keller, Joshua P.; Zhou, Tianjian; Kaplan, Andee; Anderson, G.

Further, rigorous assessment of interventions prior to widespread dissemination is crucial. OBJECTIVE: This study assesses the effectiveness and implementation fidelity of the ACT Out! Social Issue Theater program, a 1-hour psychodramatic intervention by professional actors; it also measures students' receptiveness to the intervention. METHODS: This study is a 2-arm cluster randomized control trial with 1:1 allocation that randomized either to the ACT Out! intervention or control (treatment as usual) at the classroom level (n=76 classrooms in 12 schools across 5 counties in Indiana, comprised of 1571 students at pretest in fourth, seventh, and tenth grades). The primary outcomes were self-reported social-emotional competence, bullying perpetration, and bullying victimization; the secondary outcomes were receptiveness to the intervention, implementation fidelity (independent observer observation), and prespecified subanalyses of social-emotional competence for seventh- and tenth-grade students. All outcomes were collected at baseline and 2-week posttest, with planned 3-months posttest data collection prevented due to the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Intervention fidelity was uniformly excellent (>96% adherence), and students were highly receptive to the program. However, trial results did not support the hypothesis that the intervention would increase participants' social-emotional competence. The intervention's impact on bullying was complicated to interpret and included some evidence of small interaction effects (reduced cyberbullying victimization and increased physical bullying perpetration). Additionally, pooled within-group reductions were also observed and discussed but were not appropriate for causal attribution. CONCLUSIONS: This study found no superiority for a 1-hour ACT Out! intervention compared to treatment as usual for social-emotional competence or offline bullying, but some evidence of a small effect for cyberbullying. On the basis of these results and the within-group effects, as a next step, we encourage research into whether the ACT Out! intervention may engender a bystander effect not amenable to randomization by classroom. Therefore, we recommend a larger trial of the ACT Out! intervention that focuses specifically on cyberbullying, measures bystander behavior, is randomized by school, and is controlled for extant bullying prevention efforts at each school.

355371,Factors related to preventive COVID-19 infection behaviors among people with mental illness,2020,"Since December 2019, the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread worldwide. Although the majority of patients show mild symptoms, the disease can rapidly progress in severe cases and develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that may lead to therapeutic interventions, including oxygenation, tracheal intubation, and mechanical ventilation. It is suggested that the new coronavirus spreads mostly via droplets, surface contact, and natural aerosols. Hence, high-risk aerosol-producing pro-cedures, such as endotracheal intubation, may put the healthcare workers at a high risk of infection. In the course of managing patients with COVID-19, it is essential to prioritize the safety of healthcare workers. Hence, this review study aimed to summarize new guidelines and proper airway management in adult and pediatric COVID-19 patients.","Rahmani, F.; Mahmoodpoor, A.; Salmasi, S.; Bakhtavar, H.

357557,A consensus statement for the management and rehabilitation of communication and swallowing function in the ICU: A global response to COVID-19,2020,"Research Summary: The onset of extreme social distancing measures is expected to have a dramatic impact on crime. Here, we examine the impact of mandated, city-wide social distancing orders aimed at limiting the spread of COVID-19 on gang-related crime in Los Angeles. We hypothesize that the unique subcultural processes surrounding gangs may supersede calls to shelter in place and allow gang-related crime to persist. If the normal guardianship of people and property is also disrupted by social distancing, then we expect gang violence to increase. Using autoregressive time series models, we show that gang-related crime remained stable and crime hot spots largely stationary following the onset of shelter in place. Policy Implications: In responding to disruptions to social and economic life on the scale of the present pandemic, both police and civilian organizations need to anticipate continued demand, all while managing potential reductions to workforce. Police are faced with this challenge across a wide array of crime types. Civilian interventionists tasked with responding to gang-related crime need to be prepared for continued peacekeeping and violence interruption activities, but also an expansion of responsibilities to deal with ""frontline"" or ""street-level"" management of public health needs.","Jeffrey Brantingham, Paul; Tita, George E; Mohler, George",,,495
358287,Oral mucosal lesions in patients with COVID-19: a systematic review,2021,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has had a devastating impact and efforts are being made to speed up vaccinations. The growing problem of vaccine hesitancy may affect the uptake of COVID-19 vaccine. We examined the individual, communication and social determinants associated with vaccines uptake. METHODS: Data come from a nationwide online probability-based panel of 1012 representative adults in the United States and the survey was conducted before the vaccines were available. People under the federal poverty level and racial and ethnic minorities were oversampled. Our outcome variables of interest were likelihood of vaccinating self and likelihood of vaccinating people under one's care (such as children) measuring behavioral intentions. Independent variables included perceptions of risk, exposure to different media for COVID-19 news, political party identification, confidence in scientists and social determinants of health. Logistic regression analysis was used to ascertain the effects of independent variables on the two outcome variables. RESULTS: The results indicated that 68 and 65% agreed to get the vaccine for themselves and people under their care, respectively. Risk perceptions (severity of and susceptibility to COVID-19) were significantly associated with vaccine uptake. People who relied on ""conservative"" news outlets, Republicans, and who had low confidence in scientists are least likely to vaccinate self or children. Non-Hispanic Blacks and those with least schooling were also less likely to receive vaccine for themselves or people in their care. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified race/ethnicity, risk perceptions, exposure to different media for COVID-19 news, party identification and confidence in scientists as factors that would be affecting COVID-19 vaccine uptake. The good news is that these are addressable through strategic public health communications, but a lot of work remains to be done with some urgency.","Viswanath, K; Bekalu, Mesfin; Dhawan, Dhriti; Pinnamaneni, Ramya; Lang, Jenna; McLoud, Rachel",BMC Public Health,,495

Such a fund would help ensure the strong health systems required to prevent disease outbreaks from becoming devastating global pandemics, while ensuring genuinely universal health coverage that would encompass even the most marginalized populations. The R2HCF's mission would be to promote inclusive participation, equality, and accountability for advancing the right to health. The fund would focus its resources on civil society organizations, supporting their advocacy and strengthening mechanisms for accountability and participation. We propose an initial annual target of US$500 million for the fund, adjusted based on needs assessments. Such a financing level would be both achievable and transformative, given the limited right to health funding presently and the demonstrated potential of right to health initiatives to strengthen health systems and meet the health needs of marginalized populations-and enable these populations to be treated with dignity.

Moreover, timely medical rehabilitation reduces the frequency of disability retirement. We developed and investigated the effectiveness of the telemedicine platform ""COVIDREHAB"" in order to enhance the effectiveness of the recovery period during self-isolation, as well as to provide access to rehabilitation for patients residing in remote areas or unable to undergo in-person medical rehabilitation. This pilot open clinical study includes 178 patients (108 women and 70 men) aged 32 to 82 years [mean age 50 (33-56) years] who had a moderate disease of COVID-19. We used the specialised platform COVIDREHAB for remote monitoring of the rehabilitation efficiency of patients who suffered from COVID-19. During the study, the supervising doctor assigned the patient a set of specialised questionnaires, which were filled in online. The questionnaires distributed to the patient included questions specifically designed for the COVIDREHAB remote platform as well as the mMRC (Modified Medical Research Council) questionnaire. Patients who completed the remote rehabilitation programme were found to have positive dynamics of indicators of the respiratory system functional state, and complaints.Pulmonary rehabilitation is an important part of case management for patients with respiratory diseases and plays an active role in improving lung function and general well-being of patients. Patients who completed the comprehensive medical rehabilitation program using the information and analytical system COVIDREHAB, were found to have positive dynamics of indicators of the respiratory system functional state, and complaints. Hence, at the end of the course the shortness of breath severity decreased (from 34.8% to 12.4%, as well as the feeling of lack of oxygen from 32% to 17.4%, p <0.05).

The sudden reorganization of work practices and the emotional impact of the large number of the victims had many consequences on the well-being of the healthcare professionals (HCPs) involved in managing the crisis. In the available literature, most studies have focused on the risk aspects while only few studies also take into account protective factors. For this reason, it was decided to conduct, within psycho-sociological perspective, a qualitative study with the aim to explore in depth the protective and risk factors as experienced by HCPs who worked in the Italian healthcare system during the COVID-19 outbreak. A total of 19 semi-structured interviews were conducted with HCPs-9 nurses and 10 physicians (7M and 12F) with an average age of 43 (SD = 13.4)-selected using snowball sampling. Considering three different levels of analysis the results highlight the protective and risk factors: personal history level (intrinsic/ethical motivation and flexible role versus extrinsic motivation and static role), interpersonal level (perception of supportive relationships with colleagues, patients, and family versus bad relationships), and organizational level (good leadership and sustainable work purpose versus absence of support from management and undefined or confused tasks).","De Leo, Amalia; Cianci, Eloisa; Mastore, Paolo; Gozzoli, Caterina",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,495

365512,Influence Of Grit And Lifestyle On Mental Health In College Students During The COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"OBJECTIVES: We comparatively evaluated two HIV and syphilis blood sampling kits (dried blood spot (DBS) and mini tube (MT)) as part of an online STI postal sampling service that included tests for chlamydia and gonorrhoea. We aimed to see how the blood collection systems compared regarding sample return rates and result rates. Additionally, we aimed to observe differences in false-positive results and describe a request-to-result ratio (RRR)-the required number of kit requests needed to obtain one successful result. METHODS: We reviewed data from an online postal STI kit requesting service for a client transitioning from MT to DBS blood collection systems. We described service user baseline characteristics and compared kit requests, kit and blood sample return rates, and the successful resulting rates for HIV and syphilis for MT and DBS. Pearson's &#967;2 and Fisher's exact test were used to determine statistical differences, and statistical formulae were applied to produce CIs for differences in proportions. RESULTS: 5670 STI postal kit requests from a Midlands region were reviewed from 6 September 2016-2 January 2019 (1515 MT and 4155 DBS). Baseline characteristics between the two groups were comparable (68.0% female, 74.0% white British and 87.5% heterosexual, median age 26 years). Successful processing rates for DBS were 94.6% and 54.4% for MT (p<0.001) with a percentage difference of 40.2% (95% CI 36.9% to 43.4%). The RRR for MT was 2.9 cf. 1.6 for DBS. False-positive results for MT samples were 5.2% (HIV) and 0.4% (syphilis), and those for DBS were 0.4% (HIV) and 0.0% (syphilis). CONCLUSIONS: This comparative analysis demonstrated the superior successful processing rates for postal DBS collection systems compared with MT. Reasons for this included insufficient volumes, high false-positive rates and degradation of blood quality in MT samples. A postal sampling service using DBS to screen for HIV, syphilis and other blood-borne viruses could be a viable alternative.","Page, Matthew; Atabani, Sowsan; Arumainayagam, Joseph; Wilson, Steven; Hartland, Daniel; Taylor, Stephen",Sex. transm. infect,,495

MATERIAL AND METHODS: An anonymous survey was emailed to applicants to our institution from the 2019 and 2020 urology matches prior to issuance of professional organization guidelines. The survey inquired about attitudes toward the residency interview process in the era of COVID-19 and which interview elements could be replicated virtually. Descriptive statistics were utilized. RESULTS: Eighty percent of urology applicants from the 2019 and 2020 matches received our survey. One hundred fifty-six people (24% of recipients) responded. Thirty-four percent preferred virtual interviews, while 41% in-person interviews at each program, and 25% regional/centralized interviews. Sixty-four percent said that interactions with residents (pre/postinterview social and informal time) were the most important interview day component and 81% said it could not be replicated virtually. Conversely, 81% believed faculty interviews could be replicated virtually. Eighty-seven percent believed that city visits could not be accomplished virtually. A plurality felt that away rotations and second-looks should be allowed (both 45%). COMMENT: Applicants feel that faculty interviews can be replicated virtually, while resident interactions cannot. Steps such as a low-stakes second looks after programs submit rank lists (potentially extending this window) and small virtual encounters with residents could ease applicant concerns. CONCLUSION: Applicants have concerns about changes to the match processes. Programs can adopt virtual best practices to address these issues.","Kenigsberg, Alexander P; Khouri, Roger K; Kuprasertkul, Amy; Wong, Daniel; Ganesan, Vishnu; Lemack, Gary E",Urology,,495

Thus, the aims of this study were to (1) explore the presence of symptoms of anxiety, depression and acute stress among people with a mental disorder (MD); (2) evaluate the rate of COVID-19 infection between MD and non-MD, and (3) study the relationship between the emotional state of people with a mental disorder and some environmental variables. A cross-sectional study starting on March 29 to April 5, 2020 based on a national online survey using snowball sampling techniques was conducted. Symptoms of anxiety (Hamilton Anxiety Scale), depression (Beck Depression Inventory) and acute stress (Acute Stress Disorder Inventory) were compared in MD and non-MD. The rate of COVID-19 confirmed cases among MD and non-MD was compared as well as the relationship between some environmental variables and the emotional state within MD. Up to 1839 [201 (10.9%) MD] participants completed the survey. MD showed significant higher mean (SD) in anxiety [24.7 (11.8) vs. 17 (10.3); p = 0.001], depression [7.9 (6.0) vs. 4.2 (4.2); p = 0.001] and acute stress [6.3 (3.2) vs. 4.4 (3.1); p = 0.001] scores than non-MD. The COVID-19 confirmed cases rate was higher in MD participants than in non-MD (3.5% vs. 0.4%; p < 0.001). Among the MD group, being a COVID-19 confirmed case, the lack in basic needs coverage, the rpesence of violence, drug use and the absence of physical excercise were associated with more severe depressive symptoms. Findings suggest that the COVID-19 has an impact on the emotional state of people with mental disorders.","García-Fernández, Lorena; Romero-Ferreiro, Veronica; Padilla, Sergio; López-Roldán, Pedro David; Monzó-García, María; Rodriguez-Jimenez, Roberto",J Psychiatr Res,,495

The virus has spread globally and the infection was declared pandemic in March 2020. Although most cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are mild, some of them rapidly develop acute respiratory distress syndrome. In the clinical management, chest X-rays (CXR) are essential, but the evaluation of COVID-19 CXR could be a challenge. In this context, we developed COVID-19 TRAINING, a free Web application for training on the evaluation of COVID-19 CXR. The application included 196 CXR belonging to three categories: non-pathological, pathological compatible with COVID-19, and pathological non-compatible with COVID-19. On the training screen, images were shown to the users and they chose a diagnosis among those three possibilities. At any time, users could finish the training session and be evaluated through the estimation of their diagnostic accuracy values: sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and global accuracy. Images were hand-labeled by four thoracic radiologists. Average values for sensitivity, specificity, and global accuracy were .72, .64, and .68. Users who achieved better sensitivity registered less specificity (p < .0001) and those with higher specificity decreased their sensitivity (p < .0001). Users who sent more answers achieved better accuracy (p = .0002). The application COVID-19 TRAINING provides a revolutionary tool to learn the necessary skills to evaluate COVID-19 on CXR. Diagnosis training applications could provide a new original manner of evaluation for medical professionals based on their diagnostic accuracy values, and an efficient method to collect valuable data for research purposes.","Fernández-Miranda, P Menéndez; Bellón, P Sanz; Del Barrio, A Pérez; Iglesias, L Lloret; García, P Solís; Aguilar-Gómez, F; González, D Rodríguez; Vega, J A",J. digit. imaging,,495

A broad group of delegates of scientific professional societies and cancer organisations endorse the principles of the WHO call to eliminate cervical cancer as a public health problem, also in Europe. All European nations should, by 2030, reach at least 90% HPV vaccine coverage among girls by the age of 15 years and also boys, if cost-effective; they should introduce organised population-based HPV-based screening and achieve 70% of screening coverage in the target age group, providing also HPV testing on self-samples for nonscreened or underscreened women; and to manage 90% of screen-positive women. To guide member states, a group of scientific professional societies and cancer organisations engage to assist in the rollout of a series of concerted evidence-based actions. European health authorities are requested to mandate a group of experts to develop the third edition of European Guidelines for Quality Assurance of Cervical Cancer prevention based on integrated HPV vaccination and screening and to monitor the progress towards the elimination goal.

378273,Rapid implementation of a mobile prone team during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Various measures have been taken by healthcare to limit spread of SARS-Cov-2 during the re-opening phase of endoscopy Given the risk of transmission due to aerosol generation during upper endoscopy and surface contamination we decided to pretest patients with the COVID- 19 nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) prior to their procedures in our endoscopy unit We report our results of the pretesting approach METHODS: Patients who were scheduled for endoscopic procedures were instructed to get tested for COVID 19 prior to their procedure so that results would be back by their procedure date They were also asked to quarantine themselves after the test until their procedure If positive, the procedure would be cancelled by the physician and rescheduled in 14 days They were asked additional questions on the day of the procedure and the data was recorded in Excel The data was analyzed using SPSS version 26 RESULTS: A total of 109 patients were scheduled between 5/18/20 and 6/2/20 Mean age was 52 years (SD 13) and 48 6% were male Forty-nine (45%) out of 109 patients were scheduled for a colonoscopy, 40 (37%) for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy, 17 (15 6%) for a bidirectional endoscopy, 2 (1 8%) for a flexible sigmoidoscopy and 1 (0 9%) for a video capsule endoscopy Eighty-two (75%) got tested while 27 (25%) patients did not Four patients (4 9%) tested positive for COVID 19 while the remaining 78 (95 1%) all tested negative Of those who did not get tested, 41% cancelled or no showed for their procedure Reasons for patients not getting NPS included, transportation issues (11 1%), previous COVID infection (11 1%) and fear of coming to the hospital during the pandemic (11 1%) Fifty-three (49%) patients quarantined themselves after the test as instructed, and 14 (13%) did not Quarantine status was unknown for 42 (38%) patients who got tested One patient out of the 4 who tested positive had previous exposure to COVID Of those who tested negative,±(8%) cancelled their procedure CONCLUSION: Considering the number of patients who complied with pretesting and the number of positive cases we were able to detect, pretesting could be beneficial","Wajid, M.; Fatima, H.",American Journal of Gastroenterology,,495
379837,Comparison of Reported Deaths From COVID-19 and Increase in Total Mortality in Italy,2020,"A disproportionate number of older adult residents of U.S. nursing homes have died during the COVID-19 pandemic. The novelty of the virus spurred frequently changing guidance as nursing facilities navigated response efforts. In May 2020, the 6-month COVID-19 Rapid Response Network for Nursing Homes (RRN) was launched to leverage the concept of huddles across U.S. nursing homes to reduce COVID-19-related morbidity, mortality, and transmission by identifying best practices to rapidly implement, fostering connections between nursing homes, and refocusing the national narrative on optimism for nursing home care response efforts. Daily 20-min huddles transitioned to twice weekly in the program’s final two months. A total of 93 huddles featured 103 speakers with 1960 participants engaging in both live huddles and asynchronous learning. 90.33% of participants said they learned at least two new ideas by participating and 89.17% strongly agreed or agreed that participating improved their ability to lead change in their organization. Qualitative data echoed gratitude for a centralized source of information and best practices and the sense of positivity and community the RRN provided. Leveraging nursing home huddles at the national, regional, local, system, or facility level may serve as a guidepost for future pandemics or work where guidance is new or quickly evolving.","Brandes, Rebecca Miranda Elias Bonner Alice Baehrend Joelle Fulmer Terry Lenoci-Edwards Jennifer",Geriatrics,,495
380651,Using ink to highlight follicular ostia when performing trichoscopy,2020,"OBJECTIVE: In this brief report, we characterize pediatric primary care service utilization in metropolitan Chicago over the first 24 weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic response in relation to the comparable time period in 2019. METHODS: We examined retrospective visit and billing data, regardless of payer, from 16 independent pediatric practices that utilize a common electronic medical record platform within an Accountable Care Organization of 252 pediatricians in 71 offices throughout metropolitan Chicago. We categorized visits as Well-Child and Immunization-Only (WC-IO) or Other types and identified visits with a telemedicine billing modifier. Diagnoses for Other visits were tallied and categorized using the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Clinical Classification System. We summarized counts of visits and the proportion of visits with a telemedicine billing modifier in one-week epochs for 2020 compared with 2019. RESULTS: There were 102 942 total visits (72 030 WC-IO; 30 912 Other) in 2020 and 144 672 visits (80 578 WC-IO; 64 094 Other) in 2019. WC-IO visits in 2020 were half of 2019 visits at the start of the Illinois Stay-at-Home Order and returned greater than 90% of 2019 visits in 8 weeks. Other visit types have remained below 70% of 2019 visits. A telemedicine billing modifier peaked in mid-April (21% of all visits) and declined to <10% of all visits in June (Phase 2 reopening). The top 10 most common diagnoses differed between years. CONCLUSIONS: Recovery of well child and immunization visits suggests that practice-level efforts and policy change can ensure children receive recommended care as the pandemic evolves.","Macy, Michelle L; Huetteman, Patricia; Kan, Kristin",J Prim Care Community Health,,495

Design/methodology/approach A review of the available resources and existing literature on COVID-19 and crisis management in Brunei is conducted, consequently drawing lessons on effective measures of Brunei experience in combating the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings The main key lessons of Brunei's success factors in tackling the COVID-19 outbreak are the ""Whole of Government Approach"" and ""Whole of Nation Approach"". It is to be noted that the approach would not be successful without the approval and full support of the monarch himself and, more importantly, the public's cooperation. Engaging in constant updates with the government's willingness to have themselves be led by recognised experts has gained public trust, which leads to the success of containing COVID-19, which resulted Brunei not needing to opt for a lockdown, which in turn did not lead Brunei to succumb to the second wave of COVID-19. Research limitations/implications Brunei experiences in containing novel coronavirus will help international scholars, especially in Muslim countries, to understand the lessons and develop a robust pandemic leadership model. Practical implications The lessons and strategies used by Brunei can be used as an exemplary approach to prepare for any future uncertainties by other countries. Originality/value The literature on pandemic leadership during COVID-19 in Brunei is scarce. This study might be considered as the first attempt to exhibit strong crisis leadership capacity in Brunei which resulted in the success of containing COVID-19.","Basir, K. H.; Rahman, U. F.

384032,Clinical characteristics and outcome of hospitalized children and adolescent patients with type 1 diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic: data from a single center surveillance study in Egypt,2021,"The shift to online learning that occurred in March of 2020 created an unprecedented period of intense work for faculty and sessional instructors at the postsecondary level. This shift necessitated courses be adapted under short timelines, new technology be integrated into course design, and teaching strategies and assessment methods be adapted for an online environment (Van Nuland et al., 2020). This study examines how sessional instructors, referred to in this article as contract faculty, and continuing full-time faculty members delivering the same online courses experienced this shift. While the demands of a continuing faculty position call for balancing of teaching, research, and service responsibilities, contract instructors have their own unique stressors (Karram Stephenson et al., 2020). Contract faculty lack job security, are paid by the course, and often receive their teaching assignments with short notice. By examining their perspectives on delivering the same courses online, we learn that the shift to online teaching resulted in additional work in order to adapt courses to the online environment, with faculty describing the challenges of balancing the additional work with other responsibilities of their position. Concerns of participants focused on a perceived inability to develop relationships with students in an online environment.","Danyluk, Patricia Burns Amy",Brock Education: A Journal of Educational Research and Practice,,495

METHODS: We merged by county CDC's SVI and the New York Times data on coronavirus cases. We estimated the association between the SVI and risk of death from COVID-19 per 100,000 people in counties with confirmed cases (n=2,755 U.S. counties) using multivariable Poisson regression. RESULTS: The adjusted risk of COVID-19-related death followed a non-linear pattern, with the lowest risk among SVIs from 0.05 to 0.55 (roughly 3.1 to 3.5/100,000 people) and highest risk corresponding to SVI=0.95 (6.5/100,000). Compared with a SVI=0.35, SVIs of 0.85 and 0.95 were associated with 2.3 (2.1, 2.5) and 3.4 (3.1, 3.7) excess deaths per 100,000, respectively.

Objective: To compare the change in the rate of memory decline after CABG vs PCI. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective cohort study of community-dwelling participants in the Health and Retirement Study, who underwent CABG or PCI between 1998 and 2015 at age 65 years or older. Data were modeled for up to 5 years preceding and 10 years following revascularization or until death, drop out, or the 2016-2017 interview wave. The date of final follow-up was November 2017. Exposures: CABG (including on and off pump) or PCI, ascertained from Medicare fee-for-service billing records. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was a summary measure of cognitive test scores and proxy cognition reports that were performed biennially in the Health and Retirement Study, referred to as memory score, normalized as a z score (ie, mean of 0, SD of 1 in a reference population of adults aged &#8805;72 years). Memory score was analyzed using multivariable linear mixed-effects models, with a prespecified subgroup analysis of on-pump and off-pump CABG. The minimum clinically important difference was a change of 1 SD of the population-level rate of memory decline (0.048 memory units/y). Results: Of 1680 participants (mean age at procedure, 75 years; 41% female), 665 underwent CABG (168 off pump) and 1015 underwent PCI. In the PCI group, the mean rate of memory decline was 0.064 memory units/y (95% CI, 0.052 to 0.078) before the procedure and 0.060 memory units/y (95% CI, 0.048 to 0.071) after the procedure (within-group change, 0.004 memory units/y [95% CI, -0.010 to 0.018]). In the CABG group, the mean rate of memory decline was 0.049 memory units/y (95% CI, 0.033 to 0.065) before the procedure and 0.059 memory units/y (95% CI, 0.047 to 0.072) after the procedure (within-group change, -0.011 memory units/y [95% CI, -0.029 to 0.008]). The between-group difference-in-differences estimate for memory decline for PCI vs CABG was 0.015 memory units/y (95% CI, -0.008 to 0.038; P = .21). There was statistically significant increase in the rate of memory decline after off-pump CABG compared with after PCI (difference-in-differences: mean increase in the rate of decline of 0.046 memory units/y [95% CI, 0.008 to 0.084] after off-pump CABG), but not after on-pump CABG compared with PCI (difference-in-differences: mean slowing of decline of 0.003 memory units/y [95% CI, -0.024 to 0.031] after on-pump CABG). Conclusions and Relevance: Among older adults undergoing coronary revascularization with CABG or PCI, the type of revascularization procedure was not significantly associated with differences in the change of rate of memory decline.","Whitlock, Elizabeth L; Diaz-Ramirez, L Grisell; Smith, Alexander K; Boscardin, W John; Covinsky, Kenneth E; Avidan, Michael S; Glymour, M Maria",JAMA,,495

396229,Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 disease,2020,"PURPOSE: We investigated the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine for empirical treatment of outpatients with confirmed COVID-19. METHODS: In this prospective, single-center study, we enrolled ambulatory outpatients with COVID-19 confirmed by a molecular method who received hydroxychloroquine. The patients were divided into low- and moderate-risk groups based on the Tisdale risk score for drug-associated QT prolongation, and the QT interval was corrected for heart rate using the Bazett formula (QTc). The QTc interval was measured by electrocardiography both pretreatment (QTc1) and 4 h after the administration of hydroxychloroquine (QTc2). The difference between the QTc1 and QTc2 intervals was defined as the &#916;QTc. The QTc1 and QTc2 intervals and &#916;QTc values were compared between the two risk groups. RESULTS: The median and interquartile range (IQR) age of the patients was 47.0 (36.2-62) years, and there were 78 men and 74 women. The median (IQR) QTc1 interval lengthened from 425.0 (407.2-425.0) to 430.0 (QTc2; 412.0-443.0) milliseconds (ms). However, this was not considered an increased risk of ventricular tachycardia associated with a prolonged QTc interval requiring drug discontinuation, because none of the patients had a &#916;QTc of >60 ms or a QTc2 of >500 ms. Moreover, the median (quartiles; minimum-maximum) &#916;QTc value was higher in patients in the moderate-risk group than those in the low-risk group (10.0 [-4.0-18.0; -75.0-51.0] vs. 7.0 [-10.5-23.5; -53.0-59.0 ms]) (p = 0.996). Clinical improvement was noted in 91.4% of the patients, the exceptions being 13 patients who presented with non-serious adverse drug reactions or who had severe COVID-19 and were hospitalized. Adverse effects related to hydroxychloroquine were non-serious and occurred in 52.8% (n = 80) of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that hydroxychloroquine is safe for COVID-19 and not associated with a risk of ventricular arrhythmia due to drug-induced QTc interval prolongation. Additionally, hydroxychloroquine was well tolerated, and there were no drug-related non-serious adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation in the majority of patients who were stable and did not require hospitalization.","Sogut, Ozgur; Can, Mehmet Mustafa; Guven, Ramazan; Kaplan, Onur; Ergenc, Hüseyin; Umit, Tuba Betül; Demir, Olgun; Kaya, Murat; Akdemir, Tarik; Cakmak, Sümeyye",Am J Emerg Med,,495
396624,"Design and rationale of the COVID-19 Critical Care Consortium international, multicentre, observational study",2020,"Confirmed cases in Australia notified up to 26 April 2020: notifications = 6,711; deaths = 77. The reduction in international travel and domestic movement, social distancing measures and public health action have likely slowed the spread of COVID-19 in Australia. Notifications in Australia remain predominantly among people with recent overseas travel, with some locally-acquired cases being detected. Most locally-acquired cases can be linked back to a confirmed case, with a small portion unable to be epidemiologically linked to another case. The ratio of overseas-acquired cases to locally-acquired cases varies by jurisdiction. The crude case fatality rate (CFR) in Australia remains low (1.1%) compared to the World Health Organization's globally-reported rate (6.9%) and to other comparable high-income countries such as the United States of America (5.1%) and the United Kingdom (13.7%). The lower CFR in Australia is likely reflective of high case ascertainment including detection of mild cases. High case ascertainment and prompt identification of contacts enables an effective public health response and a reduction of disease transmission. Internationally, cases continue to increase. The rates of increase have started to slow in several regions, although it is too soon to tell whether this trend will be sustained. Interpretation of international epidemiology should be conducted with caution as it differs from country to country depending not only on the disease dynamics, but also on differences in case detection, testing and implemented public health measures.",,,,495

AIMS: To investigate associations between clozapine treatment and increased risk of COVID-19 infection in patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders who are receiving antipsychotic medications in a geographically defined population in London, UK. METHOD: Using information from South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (SLAM) clinical records, via the Clinical Record Interactive Search system, we identified 6309 individuals who had an ICD-10 diagnosis of schizophrenia-spectrum disorders and were taking antipsychotics at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic onset in the UK. People who were on clozapine treatment were compared with those on any other antipsychotic treatment for risk of contracting COVID-19 between 1 March and 18 May 2020. We tested associations between clozapine treatment and COVID-19 infection, adjusting for gender, age, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), smoking status and SLAM service use.

Individuals who were on clozapine had increased risk of COVID-19 infection compared with those who were on other antipsychotic medication (unadjusted hazard ratio HR = 2.62, 95% CI 1.73-3.96), which was attenuated after adjusting for potential confounders, including clinical contact (adjusted HR = 1.76, 95% CI 1.14-2.72). CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide support for the hypothesis that clozapine treatment is associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 infection. Further research will be needed in other samples to confirm this association. Potential clinical implications are discussed.","Govind, Risha; Fonseca de Freitas, Daniela; Pritchard, Megan; Hayes, Richard D; MacCabe, James H",Br J Psychiatry,,495

397788,COVID 19 and the Patient with Obesity - The Editors Speak Out,2020,"Background: Pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema and pneumothorax are not rarely observed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Such complications can worsen gas exchange and the overall prognosis in critical patients. The aim of this study is to investigate what predisposing factors are related to pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax in SARS-CoV2-Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), what symptoms may predict a severe and potentially fatal complication and what therapeutical approach may provide a better outcome. Methods: In this single center cohort study, we recorded data from 45 critically ill COVID-19 patients who developed one or more complicating events among pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema and pneumothorax. All patients showed ARDS and underwent non-invasive ventilation (NIV) at baseline. Patients with mild to moderate ARDS and pneumomediastinum/pneumothorax (n = 25) received High Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC), while patients with severe ARDS and pneumomediastinum/pneumothorax underwent HFNC (n = 10) or invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) (n = 10). Results: Pneumomediastinum/pneumothorax developed in 10.5% of subjects affected by SARS-coV2-ARDS. Dyspnea affected 40% and cough affected 37% of subjects. High resolution computed tomography of the chest showed bilateral diffuse ground glass opacities (GGO) in 100% of subjects. Traction bronchiolectasis, reticulation, crazy paving and distortion were observed in 64%. Furthermore, 36% showed subcutaneous emphysema. Non-severe ARDS cases received HFNC, and 76% patients recovered from pneumomediastinum/pneumothorax over a median follow up of 5 days. Among severe ARDS cases the recovery rate of pneumomediastinum/pneumothorax was 70% with the HFNC approach, and 10% with IMV. Conclusion: HFNC is a safe and effective ventilatory approach for critical COVID-19 and has a positive role in associated complications such as pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax.","Simioli, Francesca Annunziata Anna Polistina Giorgio Emanuele Coppola Antonietta Di Spirito Valentina Fiorentino Giuseppe",Healthcare,,495

METHODS: In this 1.5-year, multicenter, prospective study, we investigated the usefulness of mNGS of BALF for identifying pathogens of SCAP in hospitalized adults, comparing it with other laboratory methods. RESULTS: Of 329 SCAP adults, a microbial etiology was established in 304 cases (92.4%). The overall microbial yield was 90.3% for mNGS versus 39.5% for other methods (P < 0.05). The most frequently detected pathogens in immunocompetent patients were Streptococcus pneumoniae (14.8%), rhinovirus (9.8%), Haemophilus influenzae (9.1%), Staphylococcus aureus (8.7%), and Chlamydia psittaci (8.0%), while in immunocompromised patients they were Pneumocystis jirovecii (44.6%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (18.5%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (15.4%), Haemophilus influenzae (13.8%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13.8%). Notably, novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified from two patients solely by mNGS in January 2020; uncommon pathogens including Orientia tsutsugamushi and Nocardia otitidiscaviarum were identified from one patient, respectively. Furthermore, mixed infections were detected in 56.8% of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: A high microbial detection rate was achieved in SCAP adults using mNGS testing of BALF. The most frequently detected pathogens of SCAP differed between immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. mNGS testing may be an powerful tool for early identification of potential pathogens for SCAP to initiate a precise antimicrobial therapy.","Wu, Xiaodong; Li, Yuanyuan; Zhang, Ming; Li, Miaomiao; Zhang, Rong; Lu, Xin; Gao, Wei; Li, Qin; Xia, Yang; Pan, Pinhua; Li, Qiang",Infect Dis Ther,,495

We analysed whether anosmia predicts in-hospital mortality; and if patients with anosmia have a different clinical presentation, inflammatory response, or disease severity. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study including all consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed Covid-19 from March 8th to April 11th, 2020. We determined all-cause mortality and need of intensive care unit (ICU) admission. We registered the first and worst laboratory parameters. Statistical analysis was done by multivariate logistic and linear regression. RESULTS: We included 576 patients, 43.3% female, and aged 67.2 years in mean. Anosmia was present in 146 (25.3%) patients. Patients with anosmia were more frequently females, younger and less disabled and had less frequently hypertension, diabetes, smoking habit, cardiac and neurological comorbidities. Anosmia was independently associated with lower mortality (OR: 0.180, 95% CI: 0.069-0.472) and ICU admission (OR: 0.438, 95% CI: 0.229-0.838, p = 0.013). In the multivariate analysis, patients with anosmia had a higher frequency of cough (OR: 1.96, 95%CI: 1.18-3.28), headache (OR: 2.58, 95% CI: 1.66-4.03), and myalgia (OR: 1.74, 95% CI: 1.12-2.71). They had higher adjusted values of hemoglobin (+0.87, 95% CI: 0.40-1.34), lymphocytes (+849.24, 95% CI: 157.45-1541.04), glomerular filtration rate (+6.42, 95% CI: 2.14-10.71), and lower D-dimer (-4886.52, 95% CI: -8655.29-(-1117.75)), and C-reactive protein (-24.92, 95% CI: -47.35-(-2.48)). CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalized Covid-19 patients with anosmia had a lower adjusted mortality rate and less severe course of the disease.

399713,"In adults hospitalized with COVID-19, the quick COVID-19 Severity Index predicted 24-h respiratory decompensation",2021,"Contact tracing is a public health measure implemented to control the spread and break the chains of transmission of an infectious disease. It is done by identifying, assessing, and managing people who have been exposed to an infectious disease to prevent onward transmission. We summarize findings from a rapid Cochrane review that included cohort and modelling studies to assess the benefits and harms of digital solutions for identifying contacts of confirmed positive cases of an infectious disease. The review included 12 studies, which assessed digital contact tracing for the following infectious diseases: Ebola, tuberculosis, pertussis and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This review revealed low-certainty evidence of a decrease in secondary cases of the targeted infectious disease, if digital contact tracing was used. However, it is uncertain from the currently available evidence whether digital contact tracing would produce more reliable counts of contacts and reduce the time taken to complete contact tracing. Therefore, implementation of digital contact tracing in the context of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic in African countries should be accompanied by a robust monitoring and evaluation framework. There should be an evaluation and documentation of the benefits, cost-effectiveness, acceptability, feasibility, equity impacts, and unintended consequences of the intervention.","Jaca, Anelisa; Iwu, Chinwe Juliana; Wiysonge, Charles Shey",Pan Afr Med J,,495

Postviral olfactory dysfunction (PVOD) can be prolonged and clinically challenging to treat. Olfactory training (OT) has demonstrated potential benefit for patients with nonspecific olfactory dysfunction. We sought to evaluate the efficacy of OT specifically for PVOD by pooled analysis of the existing evidence. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science. REVIEW METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines, PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases were queried and abstracts screened independently by 2 investigators. We included studies evaluating the efficacy of OT for PVOD and excluded studies evaluating pharmacologic interventions or olfactory loss from other causes. RESULTS: Of the initial 1981 abstracts reviewed, 16 full-text articles were included. Sniffin' Sticks olfactory testing results were reported in 15 (93%) studies as threshold (T), discrimination (D), and identification (I) subscores and TDI total scores. All studies reported clinically significant results after OT, defined as a score improvement of TDI >5.5. Four studies were included in the meta-analysis, in which pooled estimates revealed that patients with PVOD who received OT had a 2.77 (95% confidence interval, 1.67-4.58) higher odds of achieving a clinically important difference in TDI scores compared to controls. CONCLUSION: Meta-analysis of existing data demonstrates clinically significant improvements in PVOD associated with OT. Variability exists among OT protocols and may benefit from further optimization. Existing data supports the use of OT for the treatment of existing and newly emerging cases of PVOD.","Kattar, Nrusheel; Do, Triet M; Unis, Graham D; Migneron, Matthew R; Thomas, Andrew J; McCoul, Edward D",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,,495

METHODS: We collected biological samples from 10% of the rhesus macaque population for systematic testing to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus by RT-PCR and host antibody response by ELISA. Testing required the development and validation of new assays and an algorithm using in laboratory-developed and commercially available reagents and protocols. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: No SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antibody was detected in this study; therefore, we have proposed a modified testing algorithm for sentinel surveillance to monitor for any future transmissions. As additional reagents and controls become available, assay development and validation will continue, leading to the enhanced sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and efficiency of testing.","Yee, JoAnn L; Van Rompay, Koen K A; Carpenter, Amanda B; Nham, Peter B; Halley, Bryson M; Iyer, Smita S; Hartigan-O039,; Connor, Dennis J; Miller, Christopher J; Roberts, Jeffrey A",J Med Primatol,,495

The study adopted the survey design to select 128 respondents using the convenience sampling technique with a response rate of 68.75 per cent. The study found that most respondents were competent health information literates. Moreover, most users look for health information to gain a better understanding of the causes, severity, and prognosis of a disease. Again, most respondents demonstrated that their main source of health information during the COVID-19 pandemic was the internet followed by medical databases. The findings also indicated that major challenges encountered in seeking health information by most respondents were internet connectivity followed by lack of time and inadequate library resources. Earlier studies have focused on health information and there is relatively little research on health information provided during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, this study provides insights into the information needs and information-seeking behaviour among library users during the pandemic in a developing country setting.","Ankamah, Samuel Amegashie Prosper Yeboah Francis Amofah-Serwaa Naomi",Library Philosophy and Practice,,495

The present study examined change in loneliness in response to the social restriction measures taken to control the coronavirus spread. A nationwide sample of American adults (N = 1,545; 45% women; ages 18 to 98, M = 53.68, SD = 15.63) was assessed on three occasions: in late January/early February 2020 (before the outbreak), in late March (during the President's initial ""15 Days to Slow the Spread"" campaign), and in late April (during the ""stay-at-home"" policies of most states). Contrary to expectations, there were no significant mean-level changes in loneliness across the three assessments (d = .04, p > .05). In fact, respondents perceived increased support from others over the follow-up period (d = .19, p < .01). Older adults reported less loneliness overall compared to younger age groups but had an increase in loneliness during the acute phase of the outbreak (d = .14, p < .05). Their loneliness, however, leveled off after the issuance of stay-at-home orders. Individuals living alone and those with at least one chronic condition reported feeling lonelier at baseline but did not increase in loneliness during the implementation of social distancing measures. Despite some detrimental impact on vulnerable individuals, in the present sample, there was no large increase in loneliness but remarkable resilience in response to COVID-19.

409198,COVID-19 and late-onset hypertension with hyporeninaemic hypoaldosteronism,2021,"CONTEXT.­: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Coagulation dysfunction is a hallmark in patients with COVID-19. Fulminant thrombotic complications emerge as critical issues in patients with severe COVID-19. OBJECTIVE.­: To present a review of the literature and discuss the mechanisms of COVID-19 underlying coagulation activation and the implications for anticoagulant and thrombolytic treatment in the management of COVID-19. DATA SOURCES.­: We performed a systemic review of scientific papers on the topic of COVID-19, available online via the PubMed NCBI, medRxiv, and Preprints as of May 15, 2020. We also shared our experience on the management of thrombotic events in patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS.­: COVID-19-associated coagulopathy ranges from mild laboratory alterations to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with a predominant phenotype of thrombotic/multiple organ failure. Characteristically, high D-dimer levels on admission and/or continuously increasing concentrations of D-dimer are associated with disease progression and poor overall survival. SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers the immune-hemostatic response. Drastic inflammatory responses including, but not limited to, cytokine storm, vasculopathy, and NETosis may contribute to an overwhelming activation of coagulation. Hypercoagulability and systemic thrombotic complications necessitate anticoagulant and thrombolytic interventions, which provide opportunities to prevent or reduce ""excessive"" thrombin generation while preserving ""adaptive"" hemostasis and bring additional benefit via their anti-inflammatory effect in the setting of COVID-19.","Fei, Yang; Tang, Ning; Liu, Hefei; Cao, Wenjing",Arch Pathol Lab Med,,495
409256,Fast-track pathway for diabetic foot ulceration during COVID-19 crisis: A document from International Diabetic Foot Care Group and D-Foot International,2020,"Immune thrombocytopenia, also known as immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), has been reported as an important complication related to COVID-19.We present a 49-year-old male patient with systemic lupus erythematosus with lupus nephritis, antiphospholipid syndrome and history of ITP who developed an ITP flare in the context of COVID-19. He had no bleeding manifestations and had a good response to prednisone treatment.We review the characteristics of the cases reported to date in the literature, with an analysis of 57 patients. Mean age was 56 years (±19.6 SD), and 50.9% were male. This was the first episode of ITP in most of the patients (86.05%), with SARS-CoV-2 acting as the initial trigger. We found that ITP flares may appear in both mild and severe COVID-19 cases. They also appeared at any time during the course of the disease, 48.2% of patients developed it during hospitalization, while it was diagnosed at admission in the rest of the cases. Platelet counts were significantly lower than other ITP series, with a median nadir platelet count of 8 × 109/L (IQR 2-17.75 × 109/L). These patients show a higher bleeding rate (61.4%) compared with other ITP series. They also show a better response to treatment, with good response to the first line therapies in 76.9% of them. The most common first-line treatment was intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), used alone or combined with corticosteroids in 40.4% and 32.7% of cases respectively, while 25% of patients received only corticosteroids.Our review suggests that COVID-19-related ITP can be seen even in previously healthy patients. Clinicians must be aware that ITP may appear both in mild and severe COVID-19, at any time during its course. Given that this kind of ITP seems to be associated with a higher bleeding risk, its diagnosis in a clinical scenario such as COVID-19, where anticoagulant therapy is frequently used, may be critical. Treatment with IVIG and/or corticoids is often effective.","Alonso-Beato, Rubén; Morales-Ortega, Alejandro; Fernández, Francisco Javier De la Hera; Morón, Ana Isabel Parejo; Ríos-Fernández, Raquel; Rubio, José Luis Callejas; Centeno, Norberto Ortego",Lupus,,495

410923,From the Cochrane library: Teledermatology for diagnosing skin cancer in adults,2021,"Microbial iron reduction (MIR) is an important and ubiquitous natural process in the biogeochemical cycling of iron and carbon in anaerobic sedimentary and subsurface environments. The objectives of this study were (1) to determine if the MIR process can enhance the inactivation of Escherichia coli cells under anaerobic conditions and (2) to identify potential inactivation mechanisms. Laboratory microcosm experiments showed that the presence of MIR activity significantly enhanced E. coli inactivation, and the inactivation rate under the MIR condition was significantly larger than those under other anaerobic redox conditions. Under anoxic condition, higher Fe2+concentrations exhibited a linear function to larger E. coli inactivation rates, indicating that the production of Fe2+by MIR was one of the important roles in E. coli inactivation. When E. coli cells were amended as the sole electron source to the MIR process, increased Fe2+ production was observed, which corresponded to decreasing TOC concentration. Together, the results suggest that MIR enhanced E. coli inactivation through the production of Fe2+ as metabolic waste, and the inactivation benefited the MIR process as the inactivated cells were used as an electron source, which represents a potential new mechanism for bacterial inter-species competition. This knowledge could further improve our understanding of the fate of fecal bacteria in natural environments where the MIR process is prevalent, and may also be explored for enhanced removal of bacterial pathogens in engineering processes.","Kim, Lavane; Yan, Tao; Pham, Van Toan",,,495

411986,Utility of Emergency Medical Dispatch (EMD) Telephone Screening in Identifying COVID-19 Positive Patients,2021,"AIM: The aim of this study was to compare the vitamin D levels between the group of patients diagnosed with COVID- 19 and healthy controls, and to investigate the relationship between vitamin D levels and various clinical findings. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 262 COVID-19-confirmed patients and 157 healthy controls were included in the study. RESULTS: The mean vitamin D level in the COVID-19 group (12.8±8.9 ng/mL) was significantly lower than the control group (15.2±12.1 ng/mL) (p=0.015). The rate of those with vitamin D levels below 10 ng/mL in the COVID- 19 group (49.6%) was significantly higher than the control group (39.5%) (p=0.044). In the logistic regression analysis, it was found that those with a vitamin D level below 10 ng/mL had a 1.508-fold increased risk of COVID-19 compared to those who had 10 ng/mL and above (Odds ratio: 1.01-2.252). According to the risk analysis, those who have vitamin D levels below 20 ng/mL are 1,224 times higher than those who have 20 ng/mL and above; those under 30 ng/mL were found to have an increased risk of 2.01 times compared to those of 30 ng/mL and above. CONCLUSIONS: From the point of view of the literature data, we think that the findings we obtained may support researches that vitamin D level is significantly associated with both COVID-19 and other infections and many serious autoimmune and malignant diseases. As a result, rehabilitation programs on vitamin D deficiency should be organized and the society should be raised.

METHODS: This is a county-level population-based study using a panel data regression analysis of the proportion of in-person learning to evaluate an association with community-wide daily new SARS-CoV-2 cases. The study period was July 12-October 6, 2020. We included 73 out of 92 (79.3%) Indiana counties in the analysis, accounting for 85.7% of school corporations and 90.6% of student enrollment statewide. The primary exposure was the proportion of students returning to in-person instruction. The primary outcome was the daily new SARS-CoV-2 cases per 100,000 residents at the county level. RESULTS: There is a statistically significant relationship between the proportion of students attending K-12 schools in-person and the county level daily cases of SARS-CoV-2 28 days later. For all ages, the coefficient of interest (ß) is estimated at 3.36 (95% CI: 1.91-4.81; p < 0.001). This coefficient represents the effect of a change the proportion of students attending in-person on new daily cases 28 days later. For example, a 10 percentage point increase in K-12 students attending school in-person is associated with a daily increase in SARS-CoV-2 cases in the county equal to 0.336 cases/100,000 residents of all ages. CONCLUSION: In-person primary and secondary school is associated with a statistically significant but proportionally small increase in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 cases.","Bosslet, Gabriel T; Pollak, Micah; Jang, Jeong Hoon; Roll, Rebekah; Sperling, Mark; Khan, Babar",Clin. infect. dis,,495
412293,Self-reported immunity and opinions on vaccination of hospital personnel among paediatric healthcare workers in Denmark,2020,"Northern Italy has been one of the European regions reporting the highest number of COVID-19 cases and deaths. The pandemic spread has challenged the National Health System, requiring reallocation of most of the available health care resources to treat COVID-19-positive patients, generating a competition with other health care needs, including cancer. Patients with cancer are at higher risk of developing critical illness after COVID-19 infection. Thus, mitigation strategies should be adopted to reduce the likelihood of infection in all patients with cancer. At the same time, suboptimal care and treatments may result in worse cancer-related outcome. In this article, we attempt to estimate the individual risk-benefit balance to define personalized strategies for optimal breast cancer management, avoiding as much as possible a general untailored approach. We discuss and report the strategies our Breast Unit adopted from the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak to ensure the continuum of the best possible cancer care for our patients while mitigating the risk of infection, despite limited health care resources. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Managing patients with breast cancer during the COVID-19 outbreak is challenging. The present work highlights the need to estimate the individual patient risk of infection, which depends on both epidemiological considerations and individual clinical characteristics. The management of patients with breast cancer should be adapted and personalized according to the balance between COVID-19-related risk and the expected benefit of treatments. This work also provides useful suggestions on the modality of patient triage, the conduct of clinical trials, the management of an oncologic team, and the approach to patients' and health workers' psychological distress.","Viale, Giulia; Licata, Luca; Sica, Lorenzo; Zambelli, Stefania; Zucchinelli, Patrizia; Rognone, Alessia; Aldrighetti, Daniela; Di Micco, Rosa; Zuber, Veronica; Pasetti, Marcella; Di Muzio, Nadia; Rodighiero, Mariagrazia; Panizza, Pietro; Sassi, Isabella; Petrella, Giovanna; Cascinu, Stefano; Gentilini, Oreste Davide; Bianchini, Giampaolo",Oncologist,,495

The disease is highly communicable and produces mild to severe symptoms, generating a high demand for intensive care and thousands of deaths. In March 2020, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic and has already surpassed five million cases and 300,000 deaths in the world. The natural history of the disease has still not been fully established, hindering the elaboration of effective clinical protocols and preventive measures. Nevertheless, the disease requires a systemic approach, since there is evidence of acute and chronic complications, in addition to the catastrophic effects on the population's mental health. This highlights the need for a methodology that more effectively captures the effect of COVID-19, considering such aspects as severity, duration, and the potential to generate chronic complications that will increase the demands on Brazilian Unified National Health System (SUS). DALYs, or disability-adjusted life years, are thus an extremely useful indictor that adds mortality, an estimate of years of life lost (YLLs), and morbidity, an estimate of years of life lived with disability (YLDs). This article discusses the relevance and difficulties of studying the burden of COVID-19 and its complications in the Brazilian context, highlighting the natural history of the disease and estimating indicators such as YLDs, considering the high burden of disease in planning strategies to deal with the consequences of COVID-19 after the pandemic. The article also discusses the future challenges to deal with the disease in the SUS and the effects on the calculation of DALYs.","Campos, Mônica Rodrigues; Schramm, Joyce Mendes de Andrade; Emmerick, Isabel Cristina Martins; Rodrigues, Jéssica Muzy; Avelar, Fernando Genovez de; Pimentel, Thiago Goes",Cad Saude Publica,,495

415317,COVID-19: patient characteristics in the first phase of post-intensive care rehabilitation,2021,"The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has changed our lives in unprecedented ways. In the face of the projected catastrophic consequences, most countries have enacted social distancing measures in an attempt to limit the spread of the virus. Under these conditions, the Web has become an indispensable medium for information acquisition, communication, and entertainment. At the same time, unfortunately, the Web is being exploited for the dissemination of potentially harmful and disturbing content, such as the spread of conspiracy theories and hateful speech towards specific ethnic groups, in particular towards Chinese people and people of Asian descent since COVID-19 is believed to have originated from China. In this paper, we make a first attempt to study the emergence of Sinophobic behavior on the Web during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. We collect two large datasets from Twitter and 4chan's Politically Incorrect board (/pol/) over a time period of approximately five months and analyze them to investigate whether there is a rise or important differences with regard to the dissemination of Sinophobic content. We find that COVID-19 indeed drives the rise of Sinophobia on the Web and that the dissemination of Sinophobic content is a cross-platform phenomenon: it exists on fringe Web communities like /pol/, and to a lesser extent on mainstream ones like Twitter. Using word embeddings over time, we characterize the evolution of Sinophobic slurs on both Twitter and /pol/. Finally, we find interesting differences in the context in which words related to Chinese people are used on the Web before and after the COVID-19 outbreak: on Twitter we observe a shift towards blaming China for the situation, while on /pol/ we find a shift towards using more (and new) Sinophobic slurs.

415501,Clinical Trials of COVID-19 Therapies Should Account for Diabetes and Hyperglycemia,2021,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Testing represents one of the main pillars of public health response to SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic. This paper shows how accuracy and utility of testing programs depend not just on the type of tests, but on the context as well. METHODS: We describe the testing methods that have been developed and the possible testing strategies; then, we focus on two possible methods of population-wide testing, i.e., pooled testing and testing with rapid antigen tests. We show the accuracy of split-pooling method and how, in different pre-test probability scenarios, the positive and negative predictive values vary using rapid antigen tests. RESULTS: Split-pooling, followed by retesting of negative results, shows a higher sensitivity than individual testing and requires fewer tests. In case of low pre-test probability, a negative result with antigen test could allow to rule out the infection, while, in case of a positive result, a confirmatory molecular test would be necessary. CONCLUSIONS: Test performance alone is not enough to properly choose which test to use; goals and context of the testing program are essential. We advocate the use of pooled strategies when planning population-wide screening, and the weekly use of rapid tests for close periodic monitoring in low-prevalence populations.","Reno, Chiara; Lenzi, Jacopo; Golinelli, Davide; Gori, Davide; Signorelli, Carlo; Kraemer, John; Stoto, Michael A; Avitabile, Elisa; Landini, Maria Paola; Lazzarotto, Tiziana; Re, Maria Carla; Rucci, Paola; Taliani, Gloria; Trerè, Davide; Vocale, Caterina; Fantini, Maria Pia",Acta Biomed,,495

In addition to affecting mainly the respiratory tract, there have been many reported cutaneous manifestations of the disease. A retrospective case series based on history and clinical findings was performed across six hospitals in the UAE, including two field hospitals. A total of 324 patients with COVID-19 were identified and divided into three groups based on the severity of the disease. Forty-five (12.5%) patients had clearly identifiable cutaneous manifestation of COVID-19. Two patients each with alopecia areata and sclerosis of the extremities, respectively, were identified in the second group. Cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 have been well reported across the literature. The experience in the UAE is similar to that of published reports. The occurrence of other cutaneous manifestations with an underlying autoimmune pathogenesis should raise the possibility of such conditions in those with COVID-19.

In this work we aimed to evaluate a possible association between the severity of clinical manifestations and viral load over time during the epidemiological transition from high-to low-transmission settings. METHODS: We reviewed the cases of COVID-19 diagnosed at the emergency room of our hospital, retrieving the proportion of patients admitted to the intensive care unit. A raw estimation of the viral load was done evaluating the Ct (cycle threshold) trend obtained from our diagnostic reverse transcriptase real-time PCR test. RESULTS: The proportion of patients requiring intensive care significantly decreased from 6.7% (19/281) in March to 1.1% (1/86) in April, and to none in May (Fisher's test p 0.0067). As for viral load, we observed a trend of Ct increasing from a median value of 24 (IQR 19-29) to 34 (IQR 29-37) between March and May, with a statistically significant difference between March and April (pairwise Wilcoxon test with stepdown Bonferroni adjustment for multiple testing, p 0.0003). CONCLUSIONS: We observed a reduction over time in the proportion of patients with COVID-19 requiring intensive care, along with decreasing median values of viral load. As the epidemiological context changes from high-to low-transmission settings, people are presumably exposed to a lower viral load which has been previously associated with less severe clinical manifestations.","Piubelli, Chiara; Deiana, Michela; Pomari, Elena; Silva, Ronaldo; Bisoffi, Zeno; Formenti, Fabio; Perandin, Francesca; Gobbi, Federico; Buonfrate, Dora",Clin Microbiol Infect,,495

Studies have shown conflicting response to different vaccines in persons receiving immune suppressors or biologics. The aim of this study is to evaluate humoral and cellular response to Covid-19 vaccines in patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) using biologic and/or immunomodulatory (IMM) therapies. MethodsParticipants are adults with IBD receiving biologics or IMM planning to receive a Covid 19 vaccine. Cellular immunity (CD4+ and CD8+ T cell levels) with flow cytometry are measured at baseline and 2 weeks after each vaccine dose. Humoral immunity (antibody titers and neutralizing capacity,VNT%) is analyzed by ELISA at baseline, 2 weeks after each dose, and 6 and 12 months after vaccine. We present the early results of the first 19 subjects. The study is approved by the IRB. Results19 subjects (18 in biologics and 1 in IMM) who received 2 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine are included. Total IgG antibodies increased 21.13 times after the first dose and 90 times after the second dose. VTN% increased 11.92 times after the first dose and 53.79 times after the second dose. When compared with a healthy control cohort, total IgG antibodies and VTN% were lower in the subjects after the first dose. After the second dose, IgG antibodies increased but remained lower than controls, but VTN% were similar to controls. CD4 and CD8 mean levels had an upward trend after vaccination. ConclusionsNeutralizing capacity response to the vaccine in subjects was similar to a healthy cohort in spite of lower increases in total IgG antibodies. The CD4 and CD8 results observed may support the capacity to mount an effective cellular response in patients on biologics. Larger studies are needed to determine vaccine efficacy in these patients.","Rodriguez-Marrtino, Esteban; Medina-Prieto, Rafael; Santana-Bagur, Jorge; Sante, Maria; Pantoja, Petraleigh; Espino, Ana M; Sariol, Carlos A; Torres, Esther A",,,495

Until a vaccine is developed, they are the community's bulwark against the pandemic. It is vital that they be protected to the maximum extent possible. This entails the need for implementation of effective and compassionate protocols to keep their workplace as safe as possible for them, their colleagues and their patients in a context of much as yet not being known about the virus and awareness that some persons infected by it are for a time at least asymptomatic and that others test negative for it when they are prodromal or even already displaying some symptomatology. This has repercussions both for the liability of hospitals and multi-practitioner centres for negligence and also under occupational health and safety legislation. With the commencement of the roll out of biosecurity and disaster/emergency measures by government and escalating levels of anxiety in the general population, it is important to reflect upon the measures that most effectively can be adopted practically and ethically to protect the health and safety of those whose task it is to care for us if we become infected by COVID-19.","Freckelton, Ian",J Law Med,,495

Diagnostic testing remained one of the limiting factors for early identification and isolation of infected patients. This study aimed to evaluate posterior oropharyngeal saliva (POPS) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detection among patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. METHODS: The laboratory information system was searched retrospectively for all respiratory specimens and POPS requested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection between Feb 1, 2020 and Apr 15, 2020. The agreement and diagnostic performance of POPS against NPsp were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 13772 specimens were identified during the study period, including 2130 POPS and 8438 NPsp. Two hundred and twenty-nine same-day POPS-NPsp paired were identified with POPS and NPsp positivity of 61.5% (95% CI [55.1-67.6%]) and 53.3% (95% CI [46.8-59.6%]). The overall, negative and positive percent agreement were 76.0% (95% CI [70.2-80.9%]), 65.4% (95% CI [55.5-74.2%]), 85.2% (95% CI [77.4-90.8%]). Better positive percent agreement was observed in POPS-NPsp obtained within seven days (96.6%, 95% CI [87.3-99.4%]) compared with after seven days of symptom onset (75.0%, 95% CI [61.4-85.2%)). Among the 104 positive pairs, the mean difference in Cp value was 0.26 (range: 12.63 to -14.74), with an overall higher Cp value in NPsp (Pearson coefficient 0.579). No significant temporal variation was noted between the two specimen types.

Correlation tests were chosen for data analysis. Results: The average temperature and AQI showed significant association with the mortality rate of COVID-19. The mortality rate was not correlated with wind speed, relative humidity or precipitation. Meanwhile, higher average temperatures and more precipitation were beneficial for the recovery rate of COVID-19, but the recovery rate was not correlated with wind speed, relative humidity or AQI.

The search identified seven major targets (spike protein, envelop protein, membrane protein, protease, nucleocapsid protein, hemagglutinin esterase, and helicase) for which drug design can be considered. There are other 16 nonstructural proteins (NSPs), which can also be considered from the drug design perspective. The major structural proteins and NSPs may serve an important role from drug design perspectives.

427029,Mortality and morbidity in COVID-19 orthopedic trauma patients: is early surgery the keystone?,2021,"Assuming that there is no other solution than herd immunity in front of the current pandemic, on which groups of citizens should we build this herd immunity? Given the fact that young people face a mortality rate which is at least a thousand times smaller than people aged 70 years and more, there is a simple rational to build it on these younger generations. The transfer of some mortality risk from the elderly to younger people raises difficult ethical issues. However, none of the familiar moral or operational guidelines (equality of rights, VSL, QALY, ...) that have been used in the Western world over the last century weights the value of young lives 1000 times or more than the lives of the elders. This suggests that Society could offer covid protection to the elders by recommending them to remain confined as long as this herd immunity has not been attained by the younger generations. This would be a potent demonstration of intergenerational solidarity towards the most vulnerable people in our community. The welfare gain of this age-specific deconfinement strategy is huge, as it can reduce the global death toll by more than 80% as compared to a strategy of non-targeted herd immunity.","Gollier, Christian",Environ Resour Econ (Dordr),,495

The results show that older generations, motivated by a higher perceived severity of the disease, were more likely to take the precautionary actions recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) than younger generations. This thus suggests that persuasive health messages addressing the severity of COVID-19 might reduce the generational gap and promote preventive behaviors among young people, to protect themselves and the elderly.","Luo, Yunjuan; Cheng, Yang; Sui, Mingxiao",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,495

428033,Impact of COVID-19 on medical education and the challenges: how prepared is Nigeria?,2020,"AIMS: People with chronic pain may be particularly vulnerable to the impact of the pandemic COVID-19, and psychological flexibility may protect them. This study investigates psychological functioning in the context of COVID-19, including fear and avoidance in the context of COVID-19, specifically its association with daily functioning, and the role of psychological flexibility, among people with chronic pain. METHODS: Responses from 555 adults with chronic pain were collected through a cross-sectional online survey and analyzed. RESULTS: Eight out of 10 participants reported significant depression and nearly 9 out of 10 reported significant functional impairment. COVID-19-related fear and avoidance significantly correlated with pain, pain-related disability, depression, and work and social adjustment (râ¯=â¯18-.32), as well as psychological flexibility processes, including pain acceptance, self-as-context, and committed action, |r|=.13-.30. COVID-19-related fear and avoidance and COVID-19-related interference were significant predictors of some measures of daily functioning beyond demographics and pain, ßâ¯=â¯.09-.14. However, these associations weakened when psychological flexibility processes were factored into the models, with fear of COVID-19 no longer being a significant predictor of pain-related disability or depression, and COVID-19 avoidance no longer a significant predictor of depression. CONCLUSIONS: The psychological functioning in the context of COVID-19 appears to be negatively associated with daily functioning in people with chronic pain, and is statistically significant in this regard. Psychological flexibility may have a role in these associations for people with chronic pain in the pandemic. PERSPECTIVE: This article demonstrates the psychological implication of COVID-19 and its association with broader emotional and daily functioning in people with chronic pain. It also demonstrates that Psychological flexibility may have a role in these associations for people with chronic pain in the pandemic.","Yu, Lin; Kioskli, Kitty; McCracken, Lance M",J. pain,,495

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to analyze the imaging findings of pulmonary COVID-19 in a large pediatric series. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Children with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by either quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction from nasopharyngeal swabs or presence of circulating immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies and who underwent chest radiograph or CT or both were included in this retrospective multicenter study. Three pediatric radiologists independently reviewed radiographs and CTs to identify the presence, localization, distribution and extension of pulmonary lesions. RESULTS: We included 140 children (71 female; median age 6.3 years, interquartile range 1.6-12.1 years) in the study. Peribronchial thickening (93%), ground-glass opacities (79%) and vascular engorgement (63%) were the most frequent findings on 131 radiographs. Ground-glass opacities (91%), vascular engorgement (84%) and peribronchial thickening (72%) were the most frequent findings on 32 CTs. Peribronchial thickening (100%), ground-glass opacities (83%) and pulmonary vascular engorgement (79%) were common radiograph findings in asymptomatic children (n=25). Ground-glass opacity and consolidation were significantly higher in children who needed intensive care admission or died (92% and 48%), in contrast with children with a favorable outcome (71% and 24%, respectively; P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Asymptomatic children and those with mild symptoms of COVID-19 showed mainly peribronchial thickening, ground-glass opacities and pulmonary vascular engorgement on radiographs. Ground-glass opacity and consolidation were more common in children who required intensive care admission or died.","Ugas-Charcape, Carlos F; Ucar, María Elena; Almanza-Aranda, Judith; Rizo-Patrón, Emiliana; Lazarte-Rantes, Claudia; Caro-Domínguez, Pablo; Cadavid, Lina; Pérez-Marrero, Lizbet; Fazecas, Tatiana; Gomez, Lucía; Sánchez Curiel, Mariana; Pacheco, Walter; Rizzi, Ana; García-Bayce, Andrés; Bendeck, Efigenia; Montaño, Mario; Daltro, Pedro; Arce-V, José D",Pediatr. radiol,,495

Aim of this study is to determine the prevalence and severity of these symptoms among laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients. Secondary objective is to determine their onset/recovery time. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted from March 10 to 30, 2020 at Novara University Hospital during the COVID-19 Italian outbreak. The 355 enrolled patients answered a questionnaire at 14th (or more) days after proven infection. RESULTS: The overall population prevalence of both smell/taste or one of the two disorders was 70%. They were first symptoms in 31 (8,7%) patients. Most patients reported a complete loss that in half of the cases (49.5%) was fully recovered after 14 days, with a median recovery time of 10 days. CONCLUSION: This study confirms a high prevalence of smell/taste disorders in COVID-19 infection with self-recovery for half cases after about 2 weeks.","Dell039,; Era, Valeria; Farri, Filippo; Garzaro, Giacomo; Gatto, Miriam; Aluffi Valletti, Paolo; Garzaro, Massimiliano",Head Neck,,495

Paper-based toehold reaction, a recently emerged colorimetric POC nucleic acid diagnostic test, has been widely used for pathogen detection and microbiome profiling. Here, we introduce an amplification method called reverse transcription loop-mediated amplification (RT-LAMP) prior to the toehold reaction and modify it to enable more sensitive and faster colorimetric detection of RNA viruses. We show that incorporating the modified RT-LAMP to the toehold reaction detects as few as 120 copies of coronavirus RNA in 70 min. Cross-reactivity test against other coronaviruses indicates this toehold reaction with the modified RT-LAMP is highly specific to the target RNA. Overall, the paper-based toehold switch sensors with the modified RT-LAMP allow fast, sensitive, specific and colorimetric coronavirus detection.","Park, Soan; Lee, Jeong Wook",Int. j. mol. sci.

Moreover, it examined the impact of COVID-19 on audiology practice, and audiologist's knowledge of telehealth as an alternative. DESIGN: A web-based cross-sectional study using a questionnaire consisting of four sections. STUDY SAMPLE: This study engaged 164 audiologists practicing in Jordan and Arab countries. RESULTS: Fever, cough, difficulty in breathing, and fatigue were identified as COVID-19 characteristics by over 80% of the audiologists. Other symptoms were identified by less than half of the audiologists. The audiologists showed limited knowledge regarding measures against COVID-19 transmission. This study revealed the limited availability of infection control measures in many audiologists' workplace. The majority of audiologists stopped working due to the COVID-19 crisis and only 61.6% of the audiologists were familiar with the concepts of tele-audiology and its related aspects. However, most participants were keen to learn more. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed limited knowledge among audiologists regarding some of the COVID-19 characteristics, and limited compliance with the infection control policies.

435833,Respiratory protection among healthcare workers during cardiopulmonary resuscitation in COVID-19 patients,2020,"Breiman's classic paper casts data analysis as a choice between two cultures: data modelers and algorithmic modelers. Stated broadly, data modelers use simple, interpretable models with well-understood theoretical properties to analyze data. Algorithmic modelers prioritize predictive accuracy and use more flexible function approximations to analyze data. This dichotomy overlooks a third set of models $-$ mechanistic models derived from scientific theories (e.g., ODE/SDE simulators). Mechanistic models encode application-specific scientific knowledge about the data. And while these categories represent extreme points in model space, modern computational and algorithmic tools enable us to interpolate between these points, producing flexible, interpretable, and scientifically-informed hybrids that can enjoy accurate and robust predictions, and resolve issues with data analysis that Breiman describes, such as the Rashomon effect and Occam's dilemma. Challenges still remain in finding an appropriate point in model space, with many choices on how to compose model components and the degree to which each component informs inferences.","Miller, Andrew C.; Foti, Nicholas J.; Fox, Emily B.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.12219v1.pdf,495

The history and legacy of racial injustices and negative experiences within a culturally insensitive healthcare system have greatly contributed to vaccine hesitancy among ethnic minorities. COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy will impact vaccine uptake in the US, subsequently hindering the establishment of herd immunity (75–85% of the population vaccinated) to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission. Information targeting underserved racial/ethnic minorities in the US in a culturally competent manner has been lacking. This information is crucial for educating these communities about COVID-19 vaccines and their distribution as well as dispelling misinformation regarding vaccine trials, safety, and efficacy. This lack of education has greatly contributed to COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and will increase disparities in vaccine uptake. Moreover, timely vaccinations are also essential to curtailing virus transmission and the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants that may evade the immune response produced by the three existing COVID-19 vaccines.","Hildreth, James E.

441354,Epidemiology of Candidemia: Three-Year Results from a Croatian Tertiary Care Hospital,2021,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by massive inflammation, increased vascular permeability and pulmonary edema. Mortality due to ARDS remains very high and even in the case of survival, acute lung injury can lead to pulmonary fibrosis. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a significant role in these processes. The activities of RAS molecules are subject to dynamic changes in response to an injury. Initially, increased levels of angiotensin (Ang) II and des-Arg9-bradykinin (DABK), are necessary for an effective defense. Later, augmented angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 activity supposedly helps to attenuate inflammation. Appropriate ACE2 activity might be decisive in preventing immune-induced damage and ensuring tissue repair. ACE2 has been identified as a common target for different pathogens. Some Coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, also use ACE2 to infiltrate the cells. A number of questions remain unresolved. The importance of ACE2 shedding, associated with the release of soluble ACE2 and ADAM17-mediated activation of tumor necrosis factor-&#945; (TNF-&#945;)-signaling is unclear. The roles of other non-classical RAS-associated molecules, e.g., alamandine, Ang A or Ang 1-9, also deserve attention. In addition, the impact of established RAS-inhibiting drugs on the pulmonary RAS is to be elucidated. The unfavorable prognosis of ARDS and the lack of effective treatment urge the search for novel therapeutic strategies. In the context of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and considering the involvement of humoral disbalance in the pathogenesis of ARDS, targeting the renin-angiotensin system and reducing the pathogen's cell entry could be a promising therapeutic strategy in the struggle against COVID-19.","Hrenak, Jaroslav; Simko, Fedor",Int. j. mol. sci.

We report the case of a COVID-19 patient developing laryngo-tracheal stenosis secondary to an open surgical tracheotomy in the ICU. A conservative endoscopic management was not successful and we performed a laryngo-tracheal resection. The specimen was negative for COVID-19 but the pathological examination revealed how the virus damaged the trachea. This case is, as far as we are aware, the first case of laryngo-tracheal surgery in a COVID-19 patient and provides an insight to justify the higher rate of tracheal injuries occurring in intubated COVID-19 patients.","Lucchi, Marco; Ambrogi, Marcello; Aprile, Vittorio; Ribechini, Alessandro; Fontanini, Gabriella",,,495

A Google Trends study,2020,"BACKGROUND: The comparative performance of different clinical sampling methods for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR among populations with suspected infection remains unclear. This meta-analysis aims to systematically compare the diagnostic performance of different clinical specimen collection methods. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we systematically searched PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, Web of Science, medRxiv, bioRxiv, SSRN, and Research Square from Jan 1, 2000, to Nov 16, 2020. We included original clinical studies that examined the performance of nasopharyngeal swabs and any additional respiratory specimens for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection among individuals presenting in ambulatory care. Studies without data on paired samples, or those that only examined different samples from confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases were not useful for examining diagnostic performance of a test and were excluded. Diagnostic performance, including sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value, was examined using random effects models and double arcsine transformation. FINDINGS: Of the 5577 studies identified in our search, 23 studies including 7973 participants with 16 762 respiratory samples were included. Respiratory specimens examined in these studies included 7973 nasopharyngeal swabs, 1622 nasal swabs, 6110 saliva samples, 338 throat swabs, and 719 pooled nasal and throat swabs. Using nasopharyngeal swabs as the gold standard, pooled nasal and throat swabs gave the highest sensitivity of 97% (95% CI 93-100), whereas lower sensitivities were achieved by saliva (85%, 75-93) and nasal swabs (86%, 77-93) and a much lower sensitivity by throat swabs (68%, 35-94). A comparably high positive predictive value was obtained by pooled nasal and throat (97%, 90-100) and nasal swabs (96%, 87-100) and a slightly lower positive predictive value by saliva (93%, 88-97). Throat swabs have the lowest positive predictive value of 75% (95% CI 45-96). Comparably high specificities (range 97-99%) and negative predictive value (range 95-99%) were observed among different clinical specimens. Comparison between health-care-worker collection and self-collection for pooled nasal and throat swabs and nasal swabs showed comparable diagnostic performance. No significant heterogeneity was observed in the analysis of pooled nasal and throat swabs and throat swabs, whereas moderate to substantial heterogeneity (I2 &#8805;30%) was observed in studies on saliva and nasal swabs. INTERPRETATION: Our review suggests that, compared with the gold standard of nasopharyngeal swabs, pooled nasal and throat swabs offered the best diagnostic performance of the alternative sampling approaches for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in ambulatory care. Saliva and nasal swabs gave comparable and very good diagnostic performance and are clinically acceptable alternative specimen collection methods. Throat swabs gave a much lower sensitivity and positive predictive value and should not be recommended. Self-collection for pooled nasal and throat swabs and nasal swabs was not associated with any significant impairment of diagnostic accuracy. Our results also provide a useful reference framework for the proper interpretation of SARS-CoV-2 testing results using different clinical specimens.

Accordingly, hospitals have had to implement strategies to profoundly reorganize activities, which have affected procedures such as primary percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs). This study aimed to describe changes in PCI practices during the health emergency at the national level. The Japanese Association of Cardiovascular Intervention and Therapeutics performed provided serial surveys of institutions throughout Japan during the pandemic. The data obtained on December, 2020 and February 2021 (during the 2nd wave of pandemic) were compared with the data obtained on August 2020 (1st wave). Primary PCI for STEMI was performed as usual in 99.1%, 98.7%, and 97.5% of institutions in mid-August, mid-December, 2020 and mid-February, 2021, respectively. The COVID-19 screening tests rates in patients were significantly higher during the third wave than during the second wave (54.0% in mid-August, 2020 and 64.6% in mid-February, 2021, P = 0.002). In addition, hospitals reported that personal protective equipment was more available over time (66.4% in mid-August, 2020 and 83.8% in mid-February, 2021, P < 0.001). In conclusion, most institutions surveyed in Japan continued to perform primary PCI as usual for STEMI patients during the second and third waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the COVID-19 screening tests were more frequently performed over time.","Ishii, Hideki; Amano, Tetsuya; Kohsaka, Shun; Morino, Yoshihiro; Yokoi, Hiroyoshi; Ikari, Yuji",Cardiovasc. interv. ther.

Especially, automated severity assessment of COVID-19 in CT images plays an essential role in identifying cases that are in great need of intensive clinical care. However, it is often challenging to accurately assess the severity of this disease in CT images, due to variable infection regions in the lungs, similar imaging biomarkers, and large inter-case variations. To this end, we propose a synergistic learning framework for automated severity assessment of COVID-19 in 3D CT images, by jointly performing lung lobe segmentation and multi-instance classification. Considering that only a few infection regions in a CT image are related to the severity assessment, we first represent each input image by a bag that contains a set of 2D image patches (with each cropped from a specific slice). A multi-task multi-instance deep network (called M$^2$UNet) is then developed to assess the severity of COVID-19 patients and also segment the lung lobe simultaneously. Our M$^2$UNet consists of a patch-level encoder, a segmentation sub-network for lung lobe segmentation, and a classification sub-network for severity assessment (with a unique hierarchical multi-instance learning strategy). Here, the context information provided by segmentation can be implicitly employed to improve the performance of severity assessment. Extensive experiments were performed on a real COVID-19 CT image dataset consisting of 666 chest CT images, with results suggesting the effectiveness of our proposed method compared to several state-of-the-art methods.","He, Kelei; Zhao, Wei; Xie, Xingzhi; Ji, Wen; Liu, Mingxia; Tang, Zhenyu; Shi, Feng; Gao, Yang; Liu, Jun; Zhang, Junfeng; Shen, Dinggang",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.03832v2.pdf,495

456323,Novel techniques for wearing an ear-looped mask to reduce pressure on the ear,2020,"The only efficacious way to provide people with herd immunity against the novel corona virus [nCoV] is to administer an appropriate vaccine and help check the current pandemic. With the genetic sequence data of the nCoV already available since January 10, 2020, leading pharmaceutical companies, world over, in turn, have started working on the clinical trials to produce vaccines against this nCoV. In fact, many vaccines under the Phase III trial have claimed to demonstrate their efficacy to be as high as 95% against the nCoV. In January, the central drugs standard control organization, India had granted the emergency-use authorization [EUA] to two vaccines namely, Covishield (live vaccine, Oxford-AstraZeneca, United Kingdom being manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, Pune) and Covaxin (inactivated vaccine, Bharat Biotech, India). Although, most of the countries offer no deferral period for the donors who have been administered an inactivated vaccine against this nCoV. However, the national blood transfusion council of India has recently recommended a donor deferral period of 28 days from the last dose of vaccination. This could essentially lead to a massive loss of eligible blood donors and jeopardize the already disrupted blood supply management due to the COVID-19 outbreak. The authors, herein, propose a thorough redefining of this deferral period post-vaccination amongst the Indian blood donors.","Bansal, N; Raturi, M",Transfus. clin. biol,,495

But we have limited understanding of how local businesses adjust and adapt to these transportation-related supply disruptions. The objectives of this study are: (1) to examine the economic impact of local supply chain disruption due to transportation loss;and (2) to examine actions taken by local businesses to maintain supply chain continuity in the face of transportation loss. The study will be conducted in two interlinked phases. The first phase involves integrating results from three popularly used models (HAZUS, the Wasatch Front Travel Demand Model, and REMI PI+) to identify industrial sectors expected to be most impacted by transportation loss in a M7.0 earthquake scenario within the Wasatch Front. The second phase involves a random sample telephone survey of 380-400 local businesses (95% CI, 5% error) of the Wasatch Front from within the high-impact sectors to assess their behaviors to manage supply in the face of the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic and the recent M5.7 Magna UT earthquake as well as their earthquake risk awareness in general. The Intellectual Merit of the study lies in its creation of a new, integrated and easily replicated framework to analyze the connection between transportation and economic resilience and its focus on small businesses, a typically understudied group. The Broad Impact of this study lies in its ability to improve transportation and supply chain resilience planning in the Wasatch Region—an issue that the State and region have identified as being critical to its overall disaster resilience—but also in other at-risk communities.","Chandrasekhar, Divya",,,495

458095,Collateral damage of the COVID-19 outbreak: expression of concern,2020,"We develop a simple 3-dimensional iterative map model to forecast the global spread of the coronavirus disease. Our model contains at most two fitting parameters, which we determine from the data supplied by the world health organisation for the total number of cases and new cases each day. We find that our model provides a surprisingly good fit to the currently-available data, which exhibits a cross-over from exponential to power-law growth, as lock-down measures begin to take effect. Before these measures, our model predicts exponential growth from day 30 to 69, starting from the date on which the world health organisation provided the first `Situation report' (21 January 2020 $-$ day 1). Based on this initial data the disease may be expected to infect approximately 23% of the global population, i.e. about 1.76 billion people, taking approximately 83 million lives. Under this scenario, the global number of new cases is predicted to peak on day 133 (about the middle of May 2020), with an estimated 60 million new cases per day. If current lock-down measures can be maintained, our model predicts power law growth from day 69 onward. Such growth is comparatively slow and would have to continue for several decades before a sufficient number of people (at least 23% of the global population) have developed immunity to the disease through being infected. Lock-down measures appear to be very effective in postponing the unimaginably large peak in the daily number of new cases that would occur in the absence of any interventions. However, should these measure be relaxed, the spread of the disease will most likely revert back to its original exponential growth pattern. As such, the duration and severity of the lock-down measures should be carefully timed against their potentially devastating impact on the world economy.","Botha, Andr'e E.; Dednam, Wynand",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.10532v3.pdf,495

464684,"Comment on: ""The growth of teledermatology: Expanding to reach the underserved""",2021,"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 is a highly transmissible respiratory virus that has affected millions of people worldwide in the span of months. The burden of disease among healthcare workers (HCW) has not been well studied despite reports of infectivity and transmission around the world. Two HCW in Hospital Teluk Intan (HTI) contracted COVID-19 while attending a social event. They were in close proximity with colleagues upon returning to work, resulting in the spread of infection among other HCW in HTI. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this paper are to gain a better understanding of the key presenting symptoms of COVID-19 in HCWs in a district specialist hospital, to establish the proportion of symptomatic COVID-19 cases among HCWs and its severity and to determine the time taken from onset of symptoms or perceived exposure to diagnostic testing. METHODOLOGY: This is a retrospective descriptive analysis of clinical characteristics of subjects infected with COVID-19 among HCW in HTI. Their demography and clinical characteristics were recorded. RESULTS: There were 47 HCW in HTI who tested positive for COVID-19. The mean age of the patients was 37.5 years old. 7 patients (15.2%) had at least more than one comorbidity. Average duration of time from perceived close contact to onset of symptom was 4.5 days, while the mean duration of time from symptoms to first positive RT-PCR result was 3.4 days. Six patients (13.0%) were asymptomatic throughout, whereas 40 (87.0%) had at least one symptom prior to hospitalization. The most commonly reported symptoms were fever (65.2%), sore throat (39.1%) and cough (37.0%). In terms of severity of symptoms, the majority of patients experienced mild symptoms (Group 2, 52.2%). Two patients (4.3%) with multiple comorbidities had severe disease requiring ICU admission and mechanical ventilation. There were no mortalities, and the longest staying patient was hospitalized for 18 days. The high rates of infectivity among HCW in HTI can be attributed to working in close proximity while in the asymptomatic incubation phase, while no HCW directly involved in the care of COVID-19 positive patients were tested positive. CONCLUSION: We report that HCW share similar clinical characteristics of COVID-19 infection as those of non HCW patients in earlier studies. The infection can spread rapidly within healthcare settings via close contacts among infected HCWs. As such, we advocate distancing when working and usage of personal protective equipment when treating patients with respiratory illness to reduce transmission of COVID-19.","Tan-Loh, J; Cheong, B M K",Med J Malaysia,,495

Contradictory data is observed in the literature. Objective: To study the relation, the number of confluent veins for the right contour and the distance of the retro-hepatic segment of inferior cava vein. Methods: The study was made on 38 human livers, between 13 and 98 years old of both sexes. Obtained the anatomical piece, the inferior cava vein was dissected, being observed it relation with the hepatic tissue. Inferior cava vein was measured. The retro-hepatic segment and the number of confluent veins for the right lateral contour of the inferior cava vein were measured. Statistic study was accomplished comparing the data in relation to the sex. Results: The lobe caudate and inferior cava vein relation was determined as incomplete in 37 (97,4%) cases. The total distance of the inferior cava vein in retro-hepatic segment was 59,66 mm. The number of confluent veins was of 3,44 larger significantily in the masculine sex (p = 0,027). Conclusions: The incomplete relation of the caudate lobe is found in most of the cases, this fact facilitates the surgical access the inferior cava vein when exposed by right contour.

We propose to intensify future efforts for tracing the origins of HCoV-19, which is a very important scientific question for the control and prevention of the pandemic.","Wong, Gary; Bi, Yu-Hai; Wang, Qi-Hui; Chen, Xin-Wen; Zhang, Zhi-Gang; Yao, Yong-Gang",Zool Res,,495
471002,COVID-19 and diabetes cutaneous comorbidity,2020,"Compared to the traditional teaching (TT) method where students are lectured during class time, the flipped teaching (FT) design shifts lecture out of the classroom, as homework, and uses the class time to engage students in discussion, peer collaboration, and knowledge application. The COVID-19 pandemic displaced students and teachers from classrooms around the world. In response to these alterations, universities emergently transitioned to online course offerings. In this study, the perceptions and attitudes towards emergency remote teaching for faculty using the FT method were compared to those practicing the TT method, A survey instrument was used to collect the experiences of both FT educators (FTEs;n=23) and TT educators (TTEs;n=18) during their transition to mandatory online teaching. It was hypothesized that the FTEs would experience a smoother transition to online teaching compared to TTEs because FTEs had access to previously developed resources such as lecture videos and engaging resources for students to utilize outside the classroom. Three researchers coded the participants? responses to the survey questions and extracted common and recurring themes. It was found that 47% of FTEs reported a smooth transition to online teaching whereas only 17% of TTEs made a similar claim. Conversely, only 4% of FTEs reported having a difficult transition to online teaching compared to 33% of TTEs. Moreover, 100% of FTEs felt that at least one aspect of their flipped classroom helped them transition their course to the online platform. FTEs generally reported higher levels of confidence and experience with online teaching. These findings suggest that FTEs were more experienced with online teaching, had greater confidence in their skillset, and FT strategies supported their transition to emergency remote learning. Thus, the FT model could be one of the remote teaching methods to be used.","Gopalan, Chaya Serrano Charles Dickey Paige Bracey Georgia Fickas Julie Bartels Lynn Locke Sharon",The FASEB Journal,,495

These have been used for studying the prevalence and spread of infection in different populations, helping establish a recent diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and will likely be used to confirm humoral immunity after infection or vaccination. However, nearly all lab-based high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 serological assays require a serum sample from venous blood draw, limiting their applications and scalability. Here, we present a method that enables large scale SARS-CoV-2 serological studies by combining self or office collection of fingerprick blood with a volumetric absorptive microsampling device (Mitra, Neoteryx, LLC) with a high-throughput electrochemiluminescence-based SARS-CoV-2 total antibody assay (Roche Elecsys, Roche Diagnostics, Inc.) that is emergency use authorization (EUA) approved for use on serum samples and widely used by clinical laboratories around the world. We found that the Roche Elecsys assay has a high dynamic range that allows for accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in serum samples diluted 1:20 as well as contrived dried blood extracts. Extracts of dried blood from Mitra devices acquired in a community seroprevalence study showed near identical sensitivity and specificity in detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as compared to neat sera using predefined thresholds for each specimen type. Overall, this study affirms the use of Mitra dried blood collection device with the Roche Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 total antibody assay for remote or at-home testing as well as large-scale community seroprevalence studies.","Garcia-Beltran, Wilfredo F; Miller, Tyler E; Kirkpatrick, Grace; Nixon, Andrea; Astudillo, Michael G; Yang, Diane; Mahanta, Lisa M; Murali, Mandakolathur; Dighe, Anand S; Lennerz, Jochen; Thierauf, Julia; Naranbhai, Vivek; Iafrate, A John",Arch. pathol. lab. med.

Cities, just like people, need to protect themselves from pandemics. Therefore, the existing urban and spatial practices should be reconsidered. The aim of the study is to explore, by observation and literature review, the cities' readiness for possible pandemics or emergencies within the framework of the concept of urban immunity. Based on the elements necessary for the provision of immunity in humans, the requirements for urban immunity, the health of the infrastructure and superstructure of the soil, the resources and sustainability of a city, its resilience and growth control are discussed within the framework of urban management. In addition, the study identifies three indispensable actors for urban immunity: i) central governments, ii) local governments, and iii) citizens. Immunized cities can be defined as cities with healthy infrastructure and superstructure factors of urban soil aiming at economic and ecological sustainability that have achieved a planned and controlled growth momentum, governed by public policies created with the understanding of local welfare and democracy in cooperation with local governments, citizens, and the central government. The study is purely theoretical and focuses on universal urban immunity rather than on any country example, which constitutes the strength of the study.","Negiz, N.; Sava-Yavuzcehre, P.",Central European Public Administration Review,,495

A search was carried out in nine databases and virtual libraries in June and July 2020. Results: twenty-five articles were selected that answered the guiding question, demonstrating that the neoplasm most affected by the infection was the lung, and the main clinical manifestations were fever, cough, dyspnea, diarrhea, and fatigue. Regarding treatment, antivirals and antibiotics were the most mentioned. All articles cite the vulnerability of patients with cancer diagnosed with COVID-19, with a mortality rate of 21-30% in most articles and a prognosis for progression to severe forms of the disease. Still, most patients were cured, although in severe cases they worsened, compared to the general population.

SARS-CoV-2 is primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets and by contact. We speculated that precautions against droplet and contact transmission should be the proper way to preserve ward from COVID-19. The essence of our protocol involves: triage outside of the ward, identification of risk zones, traffic control, surveillance of all the involved subjects. Whoever attends the ward must follow the general risk prevention and mitigation measures. The application of this practical strategy can contribute to breaking the cycle of community-hospital-community transmission.","Dalu, Davide; Rota, Selene; Cona, Maria Silvia; Brambilla, Anna Maria; Ferrario, Sabrina; Gambaro, Anna; Meroni, Luca; Merli, Stefania; Farina, Gabriella; La Verde, Nicla",Crit Rev Oncol Hematol,,495

The study population comprised all COVID-19 cases confirmed in Sweden by mid-September 2020 (68,575 non-hospitalized, 2494 ICU hospitalized, and 13,589 non-ICU hospitalized) and 434,081 randomly sampled general-population controls. Older age was the strongest risk factor for hospitalization, although the odds of ICU hospitalization decreased after 60-69 years and, after controlling for other risk factors, the odds of non-ICU hospitalization showed no trend after 40-49 years. Residence in a long-term care facility was associated with non-ICU hospitalization. Male sex and the presence of at least one investigated comorbidity or prescription medication were associated with both ICU and non-ICU hospitalization. Three comorbidities associated with both ICU and non-ICU hospitalization were asthma, hypertension, and Down syndrome. History of cancer was not associated with COVID-19 hospitalization, but cancer in the past year was associated with non-ICU hospitalization, after controlling for other risk factors. Cardiovascular disease was weakly associated with non-ICU hospitalization for COVID-19, but not with ICU hospitalization, after adjustment for other risk factors. Excess mortality was observed in both hospitalized and non-hospitalized COVID-19 cases. These results confirm that severe COVID-19 is related to age, sex, and comorbidity in general.

Periodontitis, the most prevalent disease that leads to tooth loss, is caused by infection by periodontopathic bacteria. Periodontitis is also a risk factor for pneumonia and the exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, presumably because of the aspiration of saliva contaminated with periodontopathic bacteria into the lower respiratory tract. Patients with these diseases have increased rates of COVID-19 aggravation and mortality. Because periodontopathic bacteria have been isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with COVID-19, periodontitis may be a risk factor for COVID-19 aggravation. However, the molecular links between periodontitis and COVID-19 have not been clarified. In this study, we found that the culture supernatant of the periodontopathic bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum (CSF) upregulated the SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in A549 alveolar epithelial cells. In addition, CSF induced interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 production by both A549 and primary alveolar epithelial cells. CSF also strongly induced IL-6 and IL-8 expression by BEAS-2B bronchial epithelial cells and Detroit 562 pharyngeal epithelial cells. These results suggest that when patients with mild COVID-19 frequently aspirate periodontopathic bacteria, SARS-CoV-2 infection is promoted, and inflammation in the lower respiratory tract may become severe in the presence of viral pneumonia.","Takahashi, Yuwa; Watanabe, Norihisa; Kamio, Noriaki; Yokoe, Sho; Suzuki, Ryuta; Sato, Shuichi; Iinuma, Toshimitsu; Imai, Kenichi",Int. j. mol. sci.

In this study, chlorhexidine gluconate was investigated as a topical antimicrobial agent against SARS-CoV-2. This was a randomized, prospective cohort study using chlorhexidine as an oral rinse and posterior oropharyngeal spray in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The primary outcome was presence or absence of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 in the oral and oropharyngeal cavities after 4 days of chlorhexidine use and standard of care (study group) or standard of care only (control group). SARS-CoV-2 was eliminated from the oropharynx in 62.1% of patients who used chlorhexidine as an oral rinse, versus 5.5% of the control group patients. Among patients who used a combination of oral rinse and oropharyngeal spray, 86.0% eliminated oropharyngeal SARS-CoV-2, versus 6.3% of control patients.

492598,Sedation in mechanically ventilated covid-19 patients: A narrative review for emergency medicine providers,2021,"BackgroundAs at end of July 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic has been less severe in sub-Saharan Africa than elsewhere. In Malawi, there have been two subsequent epidemic waves. We therefore aimed to describe the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 exposure in Malawi. MethodsWe measured the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among randomly selected blood donor sera in Malawi from January 2020 to February 2021. In a subset, we also assesed in vitro neutralisation against the original variant (D614G WT) and the Beta variant. FindingsA total of 3586 samples were selected from the blood donor database, of which 2685 (74.9%) were male and 3132 (87.3%) were aged 20-49 years. Of the total, 469 (13.1%) were seropositive. Seropositivity was highest in October 2020 (15.7%) and February 2021 (49.7%) reflecting the two epidemic waves. Unlike the first wave, both urban and rural areas had high seropositivity by February 2021, Balaka (rural, 37.5%), Blantyre (urban, 54.8%), Lilongwe (urban, 54.5%) and Mzuzu (urban, 57.5%). First wave sera showed potent in vitro neutralisation activity against the original variant (78%[7/9]) but not the Beta variant (22% [2/9]). Second wave sera potently neutralised the Beta variant (73% [8/11]). InterpretationThe findings confirm extensive SARS-CoV-2 exposure in Malawi over two epidemic waves with likely poor cross-protection to reinfection from the first on the second wave. Since prior exposure augments COVID-19 vaccine immunity, prioritising administration of the first dose in high SARS-CoV-2 exposure settings could maximise the benefit of the limited available vaccines in Malawi and the region. Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed on August 16, 2021, with no language restrictions, for titles and abstracts published between Jan 1, 2020, and August 16, 2021, using the search terms: ""SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in Africa""[Title/Abstract]) OR ""SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in blood donors"" [Title/Abstract] OR ""SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in Malawi"", and found 15 records. There are limited SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence studies in sub Saharan Africa, however the few that are available report high seroprevalence than can be deduced from the respective national reported COVID-19 cases and deaths. Only two published SARS-CoV-2 serosurveys were done on blood donors, from Kenya and Madagascar. Blood donor serosurveys have been recommended by the WHO as an important tool for assessing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and estimating the burden of COVID-19 pandemic. Added value of this studyUnlike previous SARS-CoV-2 blood donor serosurveys in African populations that were conducted for a maximum period of 9 months, our study covers a full year from January 2020 to February 2021, capturing potential introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into Malawi as well as the two epidemic waves. This study provides evidence against the speculation that SARS-CoV-2 had been circulating more widely in sub-Saharan Africa before the first detected cases. It also provides supporting evidence suggesting that the Beta variant was the likely driver of the second wave that resulted in high SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in January to February 2021 in Malawi. Implications of all the available evidenceOur results show extensive community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Malawi as reflected in the blood donors serosurvey, with almost half the sample population being seropositive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by February 2021. This has implications for COVID-19 vaccination policy in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where there are limited available vaccine doses. Considering that prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2 augments COVID-19 vaccine immunity, strategies to maximise administration of the first vaccine dose, while waiting for more vaccines to become available, could maximise the benefits of the limited available vaccines in high SARS-CoV-2 exposure settings in SSA such as Malawi.","Mandolo, Jonathan; Msefula, Jacquline; Henrion, Marc YR; Brown, Comfort; Moyo, Brewster; Samon, Aubrey; Moyo-Gwete, Thandeka; Makhado, Zanele; Ayres, Frances; Motlou, Thopisang; Mzindle, Nonkululeko; Kalata, Newton; Muula, Adamson S; Kwatra, Guarav; Msamala, Natasha; Likaka, Andrew; Mfune, Thom; Moore, Penelope L; Mbaya, Bridon; French, Neil; Heyderman, Robert S; Swarthout, Todd D; Jambo, Kondwani C",,,495

The standard theory of its anthelmintic and insecticidal mode of action is that it is a selective positive allosteric modulator of glutamate-gated chloride channels found in nematodes and insects. At higher concentrations, ivermectin also acts as an allosteric modulator of ion channels found in host central nervous systems. In addition, in tissue culture, at concentrations higher than anthelmintic concentrations, ivermectin shows antiviral, antimalarial, antimetabolic, and anticancer effects. Caution is required before extrapolating from these preliminary repositioning experiments to clinical use, particularly for Covid-19 treatment, because of the high concentrations of ivermectin used in tissue-culture experiments.","Martin, Richard J; Robertson, Alan P; Choudhary, Shivani",Trends parasitol,,495

SARS-CoV-2 mainly affects the tissues expressing angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 is used as a receptor for the virus to enter the cells. Once SARS-CoV-2 enters the cells, it leads to further events through signaling pathways. This pathophysiological condition can appear as changes in laboratory tests. METHOD: However, the lack of studies in this area is strongly felt. The present study was conducted to review the most common abnormalities in laboratory tests caused by COVID-19 and their related molecular pathways and outcomes. RESULTS: It showed that the levels of IL-6, CRP, PCT, AST/ALT, bilirubin, ALP, GGT, LDH, ferritin, D-dimer, and neutrophils increased. Conversely, the levels of albumin and lymphocytes decreased. Since most of these parameters were related to hepatic function, their alterations indicated liver injury. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the parameters CRP, D-dimer, and CBC are more important in diagnosis. Moreover, it seems that MAPK and NF-&#954;B are the most frequent signaling pathways in which alterations may contribute to the pathogenesis of the virus. Altogether, our review encourages researchers to study signaling pathways as potential molecular targets to achieve effective treatment.","Saberiyan, Mohammadreza; Safi, Amir; Kamel, Ali; Movahhed-Abbasabad, Parvaneh; Miralimalek, Mahdiye; Afkhami, Hamed; Khaledi, Mansoor; Teimori, Hossein",Clin. lab,,495

The experiences, information needs, decision-making and support needs of children and young adult (CYA) patients or their parents during this period is not well known. METHODS: A UK-wide online survey co-produced with patients was conducted in May 2020 amongst CYA aged 12-30, or parents of children aged < 18 years with any long-term kidney condition. Participants answered qualitative open text alongside quantitative closed questions. Thematic content analysis using a three-stage coding process was conducted. RESULTS: One-hundred and eighteen CYA (median age 21) and 197 parents of children (median age 10) responded. Predominant concerns from CYA were heightened vigilance about viral (68%) and kidney symptoms (77%) and detrimental impact on education or work opportunities (70%). Parents feared the virus more than CYA (71% vs. 40%), and had concerns that their child would catch the virus from them (64%) and would have an adverse impact on other children at home (65%). CYA thematic analysis revealed strong belief of becoming seriously ill if they contracted COVID-19; lost educational opportunities, socialisation and career development; and frustration with the public for not following social distancing rules. Positive outcomes included improved family relationships and community cohesion. Only a minority (14-21% CYA and 20-31% parents, merged questions) desired more support. Subgroup analysis identified greater negative psychological impact in the shielded group. CONCLUSIONS: This survey demonstrates substantial concern and need for accurate tailored advice for CYA based on individualised risks to improve shared decision making.","Tse, Yincent; Darlington, Anne-Sophie E; Tyerman, Kay; Wallace, Dean; Pankhurst, Tanya; Chantziara, Sofia; Culliford, David; Recio-Saucedo, Alejandra; Nagra, Arvind",Pediatr. nephrol,,495

A single-institute, retrospective cohort study",2021,"INTRODUCTION: An effective vaccine may help us to exit the COVID-19 pandemic. General Practitioners/Family Doctors (GPs/FDs) play a vital role in public vaccination in most countries and they also serve as role models. However, they may not always follow national vaccination policies. This study was carried out in order to ascertain the degree of vaccine hesitancy of GPs and GP trainees in Malta vis-à-vis influenza vaccination and a putative novel COVID-19 vaccine. METHODS: A short, anonymous questionnaire was emailed via the Malta College of Family Doctors. RESULTS: There were 123 responses from 288 GPs (33.3%) and 62 trainees (43.5%). Significantly more will take the influenza vaccine, at all ages. Almost two thirds of GPs are likely to take the COVID-19 vaccine but significantly less (a third) of trainees will. Older doctors were likelier to take this vaccine. The likelihood of taking influenza vaccination was significantly associated with that of taking COVID-19 vaccine. The majority of COVID-19 concerns pertained to insufficient knowledge and concern regarding potential long-term side effects. DISCUSSION: The vaccination rates for COVID-19 are somewhat less than those for influenza uptake. Vaccine hesitancy in the young, and here in young doctors, is a seemingly global youth phenomenon, an unwise insouchance when the possibility of long-term viral complications is considered. An information drive should be mounted with regard to COVID-19 vaccination as well as a campaign to heavily promote annual influenza vaccination.","Grech, Victor; Bonnici, Jason; Zammit, Dorothy",Early Hum Dev,,495

Here we analyze impressive successes by McClellan et al., 2020, in stabilizing their original S2P vaccine to Hexapro. Hexapro has expanded the two proline mutations of S2P, 2017, to six combined proline mutations in S2. Their four new mutations are the result of surveying 100 possibilities in their detailed structure-based context Our analysis, based on only sparse publicly available data, suggests new proline mutations could improve the Hexapro combination to Octapro or beyond.","Moret, Marcelo A.; Zebende, Gilney F.; Phillips, J.

The allergy/immunology community has quickly responded by mobilizing practice adjustments and embracing new paradigms of care to protect patients and staff from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 exposure. Social distancing is key to slowing contagion but adds to complexity of care and increases isolation and anxiety. Uncertainty exists across a new COVID-19 reality, and clinician well-being may be an underappreciated priority. Wellness incorporates mental, physical, and spiritual health to protect against burnout, which impairs both coping and caregiving abilities. Understanding the stressors that COVID-19 is placing on clinicians can assist in recognizing what is needed to return to a point of wellness. Clinicians can leverage easily accessible tools, including the Strength-Focused and Meaning-Oriented Approach to Resilience and Transformation approach, wellness apps, mindfulness, and gratitude. Realizing early warning signs of anxiety, depression, substance abuse, and posttraumatic stress disorder is important to access safe and confidential resources. Implementing wellness strategies can improve flexibility, resilience, and outlook. Historical parallels demonstrate that perseverance is as inevitable as pandemics and that we need not navigate this unprecedented time alone.","Bansal, Priya; Bingemann, Theresa A; Greenhawt, Matthew; Mosnaim, Giselle; Nanda, Anil; Oppenheimer, John; Sharma, Hemant; Stukus, David; Shaker, Marcus",J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract,,495

508870,COVID-19 Infection and Corrected QT Interval Prolongation-Collateral Damage From Our Newest Enemy,2021,"Segmentation of COVID-19 lesions from chest CT scans is of great importance for better diagnosing the disease and investigating its extent. However, manual segmentation can be very time consuming and subjective, given the lesions' large variation in shape, size and position. On the other hand, we still lack large manually segmented datasets that could be used for training machine learning-based models for fully automatic segmentation. In this work, we propose a new interactive and user-friendly tool for COVID-19 lesion segmentation, which works by alternating automatic steps (based on level-set segmentation and statistical shape modeling) with manual correction steps. The present software was tested by two different expertise groups: one group of three radiologists and one of three users with an engineering background. Promising segmentation results were obtained by both groups, which achieved satisfactory agreement both between- and within-group. Moreover, our interactive tool was shown to significantly speed up the lesion segmentation process, when compared to fully manual segmentation. Finally, we investigated inter-observer variability and how it is strongly influenced by several subjective factors, showing the importance for AI researchers and clinical doctors to be aware of the uncertainty in lesion segmentation results.","Bendazzoli, Simone; Brusini, Irene; Astaraki, Mehdi; Persson, Mats; Yu, Jimmy; Connolly, Bryan; Nyr'en, Sven; Strand, Fredrik; Smedby, Orjan; Wang, Chunliang",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.14752v2.pdf,495

METHODS: Synthesizing data from various government and nonprofit institutions for all 3142 United States (US) counties, we studied county-level characteristics that were associated with cumulative and weekly case and death rates through 12/21/2020. We used generalized linear mixed models to model cumulative and weekly (40 repeated measures per county) cases and deaths. Cumulative and weekly models included state fixed effects and county-specific random effects. Weekly models additionally allowed covariate effects to vary by season and included US Census region-specific B-splines to adjust for temporal trends. RESULTS: Rural counties, counties with more minorities and white/non-white segregation, and counties with more people with no high school diploma and with medical comorbidities were associated with higher cumulative COVID-19 case and death rates. In the spring, urban counties and counties with more minorities and white/non-white segregation were associated with increased weekly case and death rates. In the fall, rural counties were associated with larger weekly case and death rates. In the spring, summer, and fall, counties with more residents with socioeconomic disadvantage and medical comorbidities were associated greater weekly case and death rates. CONCLUSIONS: These county-level associations are based off complete data from the entire country, come from a single modeling framework that longitudinally analyzes the US COVID-19 pandemic at the county-level, and are applicable to guiding government resource allocation policies to different US counties.","Li, Daniel; Gaynor, Sheila M; Quick, Corbin; Chen, Jarvis T; Stephenson, Briana J K; Coull, Brent A; Lin, Xihong",BMC Public Health,,495

While not standardized, these practices can be roughly divided into two categories, namely heat inactivation and solvent-detergent treatments. These routine procedures should also apply to samples intended for Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) analysis. Assessing the impact of virus-inactivating pre-treatments is therefore of pivotal importance, given the well-known variability introduced by different pre-analytical steps on downstream EVs isolation and analysis. Arguably, shared guidelines on inactivation protocols tailored to best address EVs-specific requirements will be needed among the analytical community, yet deep investigations in this direction have not yet been reported. We here provide insights into SARS-CoV-2 inactivation practices to be adopted prior to serum EVs analysis by comparing solvent/detergent treatment vs. heat inactivation. Our analysis entails the evaluation of EVs recovery and purity along with biochemical, biophysical and biomolecular profiling by means of a set of complementary analytical techniques: Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis, Western Blotting, Atomic Force Microscopy, miRNA content (digital droplet PCR) and tetraspanin assessment by microarrays. Our data suggest an increase in ultracentrifugation (UC) recovery following heat treatment; however, it is accompanied by a marked enrichment in EVs-associated contaminants. On the other hand, solvent/detergent treatment is promising for small EVs (<150 nm range), yet a depletion of larger vesicular entities was detected. This work represents a first step towards the identification of optimal serum inactivation protocols targeted to EVs analysis.","Frigerio, Roberto; Musicò, Angelo; Brucale, Marco; Ridolfi, Andrea; Galbiati, Silvia; Vago, Riccardo; Bergamaschi, Greta; Ferretti, Anna Maria; Chiari, Marcella; Valle, Francesco; Gori, Alessandro; Cretich, Marina",,,495

In this study, we evaluated the negative predictive value (NPV) of a home-based 7-day infection control strategy. METHODS: HCWs advised by their infection control or occupational health officer to self-isolate due to a high-risk SARS-CoV-2 exposure were enrolled between May and October 2020. The strategy consisted of symptom-triggered nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing from day 0 to day 7 after exposure and standardized home-based nasopharyngeal swab and saliva testing on day 7. The NPV of this strategy was calculated for (1) clinical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnosis from day 8-14 after exposure, and for (2) asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 detected by standardized nasopharyngeal swab and saliva specimens collected at days 9, 10, and 14 after exposure. Interim results are reported in the context of a second wave threatening this essential workforce. RESULTS: Among 30 HCWs enrolled, the mean age was 31 years (SD, ±9), and 24 (80%) were female. Moreover, 3 were diagnosed with COVID-19 by day 14 after exposure (secondary attack rate, 10.0%), and all cases were detected using the 7-day infection control strategy: the NPV for subsequent clinical COVID-19 or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 detection by day 14 was 100.0% (95% CI, 93.1%-100.0%). CONCLUSIONS: Among HCWs with high-risk exposure to SARS-CoV-2, a home-based 7-day infection control strategy may have a high NPV for subsequent COVID-19 and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 detection. Ongoing data collection and data sharing are needed to improve the precision of the estimated NPV, and here we report interim results to inform infection control strategies in light of a second wave threatening this essential workforce.","Benea, Carla; Rendon, Laura; Papenburg, Jesse; Frenette, Charles; Imacoudene, Ahmed; McDonald, Emily G; Nguyen, Quoc D; Rajda, Ewa; Tran, Estelle; Vameghestahbanati, Motahareh; Benedetti, Andrea; Behr, Marcel A; Smith, Benjamin M",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,,495

METHODS: The medical records of patients who underwent adjustable graded augmentation of SRT with or without adjustable medial rectus recession (MRc) from February 2017 to December 2019 were reviewed retrospectively. A Mendez ring was used to monitor torsional change after transposition of the superior rectus muscle to the lateral rectus muscle and after sequential placement of 2 or 3 augmentation sutures by superior rectus-lateral rectus loop myopexy. If excessive mechanical intorsion was induced, the responsible augmentation suture was severed intraoperatively. If torsional or vertical diplopia was noted after recovery, the distal-most augmentation suture was cut. Exotropia was managed by severing the distal-most augmentation suture or by medial rectus adjustment. RESULTS: A total of 8 patients who underwent adjustable graded augmentation of SRT were included (6 using the 3-suture technique): 3 for esotropic Duane syndrome, 2 for abducens nerve palsy, 1 for Moebius syndrome, and 2 for combined trochlear and abducens nerve palsies. Of the 8 patients, 4 had prior strabismus surgery, and 1 patient had previously undergone treatment with botulinum toxin. Severing one augmentation suture in 3 cases resolved vertical (n = 2) or torsional (n = 1) diplopia and consecutive exotropia (n = 1), resulting in excellent alignment and reduction of torticollis to <4° in 7 cases. The technique proved insufficient in 1 patient, who had undergone 3 prior strabismus procedures.

The mechanisms mediating these processes remain unclear. METHODS: We performed multicolor staining for SARS-CoV-2 proteins and lineage markers to define viral tropism and lung pathobiology in 5 autopsy cases. RESULTS: Lung parenchyma showed severe DAD with thromboemboli. Viral infection was found in an extensive range of cells including pneumocyte type II, ciliated, goblet, club-like and endothelial cells. Over 90% infiltrating immune cells were positive for viral proteins including macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, and natural killer (NK), B and T cells. Most but not all infected cells were ACE2-positive. The numbers of infected and ACE2-positive cells are associated with extensive tissue damage. Infected tissues exhibited high inflammatory cells including macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils and NK cells, and low B- but abundant T-cells consisting of mainly T helper cells, few cytotoxic T cells, and no T regulatory cell. Robust interleukin-6 expression was present in most cells, with or without infection. CONCLUSIONS: In fatal COVID-19 lungs, there are broad SARS-CoV-2 cell tropisms, extensive infiltrated innate immune cells, and activation and depletion of adaptive immune cells, contributing to severe tissue damage, thromboemboli, excess inflammation and compromised immune responses.","Ramos da Silva, Suzane; Ju, Enguo; Meng, Wen; Paniz Mondolfi, Alberto E; Dacic, Sanja; Green, Anthony; Bryce, Clare; Grimes, Zachary; Fowkes, Mary; Sordillo, Emilia M; Cordon-Cardo, Carlos; Guo, Haitao; Gao, Shou-Jiang",J. infect. dis,,495

METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 13 adult long COVID patients who complained for at least one persistent symptom for >30 days after infection recovery. A group of 26 melanoma patients with negative PET/CT matched for sex/age was used as controls (2:1 control to case ratio). Qualitative and semi-quantitative analysis of whole-body images was performed. Fisher exact and Mann-Whitney tests were applied to test differences between the two groups. Voxel-based analysis was performed to compare brain metabolism in cases and controls. Cases were further grouped according to prevalent symptoms and analysed accordingly. RESULTS: In 4/13 long COVID patients, CT images showed lung abnormalities presenting mild [18F]FDG uptake. Many healthy organs/parenchyma SUVs and SUV ratios significantly differed between the two groups (p &#8804; 0.05). Long COVID patients exhibited brain hypometabolism in the right parahippocampal gyrus and thalamus (uncorrected p < 0.001 at voxel level). Specific area(s) of hypometabolism characterised patients with persistent anosmia/ageusia, fatigue, and vascular uptake (uncorrected p < 0.005 at voxel level). CONCLUSION: [18F]FDG PET/CT acknowledged the multi-organ nature of long COVID, supporting the hypothesis of underlying systemic inflammation. Whole-body images showed increased [18F]FDG uptake in several ""target"" and ""non-target"" tissues. We found a typical pattern of brain hypometabolism associated with persistent complaints at the PET time, suggesting a different temporal sequence for brain and whole-body inflammatory changes.

The contribution of forest carbon sink is well-known, but the carbon sink function of mariculture is rarely known. Based on the statistics of China's fishery department and the quality assessment method, this paper constructed a preliminary accounting system for the removable carbon sink of mariculture shellfish and algae, and estimated its capacity in China from 2005 to 2017. On this basis, the logarithmic mean Divisia index was used to analyze the effects of structure and scale factors on the removable carbon sink of mariculture shellfish and algae. The results showed that the annual average removable carbon sink of shellfish and algae in China's mariculture reached 92.7 ten thousand tons, and the overall trend was upward. The total removable carbon sink of shellfish was greater than that of algae. Among them, Grassastrea gigas was the main source of removable carbon sink in China's mariculture, followed by Ruditapes philippinarum. The economic value of annual removable carbon sink of mariculture shellfish and algae in China was equivalent to 139-556 million dollars. Furthermore, the scale factor plays a leading role in the removable carbon sink capacity of mariculture in China, while the structure factor plays a minor role.","Ren, Wenhan",,,495

However, studies from other viral infections have shown that females can mount stronger immune responses against viruses than males.

Yet, the accuracy is often hindered by Soft Tissue Artifact (STA). This is a major issue in clinical gait analysis where kinematic results are used for decision-making. It also has a considerable influence on the results of rigid body and Finite Element (FE) musculoskeletal models that rely on SM-based kinematics to estimate muscle, contact and ligament forces. Current techniques devised to compensate for STA, in particular multi-body optimization methods, often consider simplified joint models. Although joint personalization with anatomical constraints has improved kinematic estimation, these models yet don't represent a fully reliable solution to the STA problem, thus allowing us to envisage an alternative approach. In this perspective, we propose to develop a conceptual FE-based model of the lower limb for STA compensation and evaluate it for 66 healthy subjects under level walking motor task. Both hip and knee joint kinematics were analyzed, considering both rotational and translational joint motion. Results showed that STA caused underestimation of the hip joint kinematics (up to 2.2°) for all rotational DoF, and overestimation of knee joint kinematics (up to 12°) except in flexion/extension. Joint kinematics, in particular the knee joint, appeared to be sensitive to soft tissue stiffness parameters (rotational and translational mean difference up to 1.5° and 3.4 mm). Analysis of the results using alternative joint representations highlighted the versatility of the proposed modeling approach. This work paves the way for using personalized models to compensate for STA in healthy subjects and different activities.","Lahkar, Bhrigu K; Rohan, Pierre-Yves; Assi, Ayman; Pillet, Helene; Bonnet, Xavier; Thoreux, Patricia; Skalli, Wafa",J Biomech,,495

Clinical evidence suggests that the intestine is another high-risk organ for SARS-CoV-2 infection besides the lungs. However, a model that can accurately reflect the response of the human intestine to the virus is still lacking. Here, we created an intestinal infection model on a chip that allows the recapitulation of human relevant intestinal pathophysiology induced by SARS-CoV-2 at organ level. This microengineered gut-on-chip reconstitutes the key features of the intestinal epithelium-vascular endothelium barrier through the three-dimensional (3D) co-culture of human intestinal epithelial, mucin-secreting, and vascular endothelial cells under physiological fluid flow. The intestinal epithelium showed permissiveness for viral infection and obvious morphological changes with injury of intestinal villi, dispersed distribution of mucus-secreting cells, and reduced expression of tight junction (E-cadherin), indicating the destruction of the intestinal barrier integrity caused by virus. Moreover, the vascular endothelium exhibited abnormal cell morphology, with disrupted adherent junctions. Transcriptional analysis revealed abnormal RNA and protein metabolism, as well as activated immune responses in both epithelial and endothelial cells after viral infection (e.g., upregulated cytokine genes), which may contribute to the injury of the intestinal barrier associated with gastrointestinal symptoms. This human organ system can partially mirror intestinal barrier injury and the human response to viral infection, which is not possible in existing in vitro culture models. It provides a unique and rapid platform to accelerate COVID-19 research and develop novel therapies.","Guo, Yaqiong; Luo, Ronghua; Wang, Yaqing; Deng, Pengwei; Song, Tianzhang; Zhang, Min; Wang, Peng; Zhang, Xu; Cui, Kangli; Tao, Tingting; Li, Zhongyu; Chen, Wenwen; Zheng, Yongtang; Qin, Jianhua",,,495

METHODS: We performed an anonymized cross-sectional survey, conducted from April 16 to May 18, 2020, of VA rheumatology providers. We assessed provider perspective on COVID-19 issues and resilience. RESULTS: Of the 153 eligible VA rheumatologists, 103 (67%) completed the survey. A significant proportion of providers reported &#8805;50% increase related to COVID-19 in visits by: (1) telephone, 53%; (2) video-based VA video connect (VVC), 44%; and (3) clinical video telehealth (CVT) with a facilitator, 29%. A majority of the responders were somewhat or very comfortable with technology for providing healthcare to established patients during COVID-19 pandemic using: (1) telephone, 87%; (2) VA video connect (VVC), 64%; and (3) in-person visits, 54%. A smaller proportion were comfortable with technology providing healthcare to new patients. At least 65% of rheumatologists considered telephone visits appropriate for established patients with gout, osteoporosis, polymyalgia rheumatica, stable rheumatoid arthritis, stable spondyloarthritis, or osteoarthritis; 32% reported a rheumatology medication shortage. Adjusted for age, sex and ethnicity, high provider resilience was associated with significantly higher odds ratio (OR) of comfort with technology for telephone (OR, 3.1 (95% CI, 1.1-9.7)) and VVC visits for new patients (OR, 4.7 (95% CI, 1.4-15.7)).

Here, we developed a trimeric SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) subunit vaccine candidate that simulates the natural structure of the spike (S) trimer glycoprotein. Immunization with the RBD-trimer induced robust humoral and cellular immune responses, and a high level of neutralizing antibodies was maintained for at least 4.5 months. Moreover, the antibodies that were produced in response to the vaccine effectively cross-neutralized the SARS-CoV-2 501Y.V2 variant (B.1.351). Of note, when the vaccine-induced antibodies dropped to a sufficiently low level, only one boost quickly activated the anamnestic immune response, conferring full protection against a SARS-CoV-2 challenge in rhesus macaques without typical histopathological changes in the lung tissues. These results demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 RBD-trimer vaccine candidate is highly immunogenic and safe, providing long-lasting, broad, and significant immunity protection in nonhuman primates, thereby offering an optimal vaccination strategy against COVID-19.","Yang, Limin; Tian, Deyu; Han, Jian-bao; Fan, Wenhui; Zhang, Yuan; Li, Yunlong; Sun, Wenqiang; Wei, Yanqiu; Tian, Xiaodong; Yu, Dan-dan; Feng, Xiao-li; Cheng, Gong; Bi, Yuhai; Zheng, Yong-tang; Liu, Wenjun",Innovation (N Y),https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xinn.2021.100140; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666675821000655?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666675821000655; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34179862/,495

Clinical methods alone can result in the under-recognition of this heterogeneous syndrome. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the role that big data and machine learning (ML) have played in understanding the heterogeneity of the disease and the development of various prediction algorithms. Most of the work in the field of ML in ARDS has been in the development of prediction models that have comparable efficacies to that of traditional models. Prediction algorithms have been useful in identifying new variables that may be important to consider in the future, supplementing the unknown information with the help of available noninvasive parameters, as well as predicting mortality. Phenotype identification using an unsupervised ML algorithm has been pivotal in classifying the heterogeneous population into more homogenous classes. Big data generated from ventilators in the form of ventilator waveform analysis and images in the form of radiomics have also been leveraged for the identification of the syndrome and can be incorporated into a clinical decision support system. Although the results are promising, lack of generalizability, “black box” nature of algorithms and concerns about “alarm fatigue” should be addressed for more mainstream adoption of these models.","Bhattarai, Sanket; Gupta, Ashish; Ali, Eiman; Ali, Moeez; Riad, Mohamed; Adhikari, Prakash; Mostafa, Jihan A",Cureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33786236/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.13529,495

The biology and infectivity of the virus has been intensively studied in order to gain a better understanding of the molecular basis of virus-host cell interactions during infection. It is known that SARS-CoV-2 binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) via its spike protein. Priming of the virus by specific proteases leads to viral entry via endocytosis and to the subsequent steps in the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2. Sphingosine and ceramide belong to the sphingolipid family and are abundantly present in cell membranes. These lipids were recently shown to interfere with the uptake of virus particles of SARS-CoV-2 into epithelial cell lines and primary human nasal cells in culture. The mechanisms of action were partly different, as sphingosine blocked, whilst ceramide facilitated viral entry. Acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) is vital for the generation of ceramide and functional inhibition of ASM by drugs like amitriptyline reduced SARS-CoV-2 entry into the epithelial cells. Recent data indicates that serum level of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a prognostic factor for COVID-2 severity. Further, stimulation of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1) might also constrain the hyper-inflammatory conditions linked to SARS-CoV-2. Here, we review recent exciting findings regarding sphingolipids in the uptake of SARS-CoV-2 and in the course of COVID-19 disease. More studies are required on the mechanisms of action and the potential use of antidepressant drugs and sphingolipid modifiers in SARS-CoV-2 infections and in the treatment of the more serious and fatal consequences of the disease.","Törnquist, Kid; Asghar, Muhammad Yasir; Srinivasan, Vignesh; Korhonen, Laura; Lindholm, Dan",Front Cell Dev Biol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2021.689854; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34222257/,495

Measurement of neoadjuvant drug effects has also enabled the identification of patients with high risk of distant recurrence and has justified development of additional adjuvant approaches to improve outcomes. Neoadjuvant evaluation of new drugs was significantly improved by the introduction of pathologic complete response (pCR) rate as a quantitative surrogate endpoint for distant disease-free survival (DDFS) and event free survival (EFS). The neoadjuvant phase 2 platform trial I-SPY 2 simultaneously tests multiple drugs across multiple breast cancer subtypes using Bayesian methods of adaptive randomization for assessment of drug efficacy. In addition to the pCR endpoint, the I-SPY 2 trial has demonstrated that the residual cancer burden (RCB) score measures gradations of tumor response that correlate with DDFS and EFS across treatments and subtypes. For HER2-positive and triple-negative breast cancers that have failed to attain pCR with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), effective modifications of adjuvant treatment have improved outcomes and changed the standard of care for these subtypes. Neoadjuvant therapy is therefore preferred for stage II and III, as well as some stage I, HER2-positive and triple-negative tumors. Neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET) strategies have also emerged from innovative trials for stage II and III estrogen receptor (ER)-positive/HER2-negative tumors, as in the ALTERNATE trial. From neoadjuvant trials, opportunities have emerged to de-escalate therapy on the basis of metrics of response to chemotherapy or hormonal therapy. Neoadjuvant therapy for early breast cancer is therefore emerging as a promising approach to accelerate new drug development, optimize treatment strategies, and (where appropriate) de-escalate neoadjuvant therapy.","Potter, David A; Herrera-Ponzanelli, César A; Hinojosa, Diego; Castillo, Rafael; Hernandez-Cruz, Irwin; Arrieta, Victor A; Franklin, Michael J; Yee, Douglas",Fac Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33659921/; https://doi.org/10.12703/r/10-2,495

Stakeholders, governments, and national authorities have mounted responses to contain the pandemic. This study aimed to catalogue the risk communication and community engagement (RCCE) strategies as well as the challenges facing RCCE in 13 African countries. Methods: We conducted a narrative review of evidence to answer the aim of the study. The search was conducted in March 2021 and evidence published between December 2019 and February 2021 were included. Data reported in this article were obtained from reports, literature in peer-reviewed journals, grey literature and other data sources in 13 African countries. The 13 countries include Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Algeria, Angola, Cote d’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mauritius, Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia. The authors also snowball further data to gather information for this review. Results: Most of the priority African countries have RCCE strategies to contain the transmission and spread of the coronavirus. Our findings revealed RCCE strategies in the 13 African countries focused on training and capacity building, risk communication systems, internal and partners’ coordination, community engagement, public communication, contending uncertainty, addressing misperceptions and managing misinformation. However, the RCCE response activities were not without challenges, which included distrust in government, cultural, social, and religious resistance, and inertia among others. Conclusion: With the similar RCCE approaches and interventions seen across the countries, it is clear that countries are learning from each other and from global health organizations to develop COVID-19 RCCE programs. It is important for African countries to address the challenges facing RCCE in order to effectively contain the pandemic and to prepare for future public health emergencies.","Adebisi, Yusuff Adebayo; Rabe, Adrian; Lucero-Prisno III, Don Eliseo",Health Promot Perspect,https://doi.org/10.34172/hpp.2021.18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34195037/,495

During the last years, changed treatment regimens for non-transplanted patients with hematological malignancies have had potential to increase the incidence of viral infections in this group. In this study, we have prospectively investigated the prevalence of a broad range of respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) as well as viruses that commonly reactivate after allogeneic HSCT. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Patients with hematological malignancies and therapy induced neutropenia (n = 159) were screened regarding a broad range of common respiratory viruses in the nasopharynx and for viruses commonly detected in severely immunosuppressed patients in peripheral blood. Quantitative PCR was used for detection of viruses. A viral pathogen was detected in 35% of the patients. The detection rate was rather similar in blood (22%) and NPA (18%) with polyoma BK virus and rhinovirus as dominating pathogens in blood and NPA, respectively. Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (p<0.01) and patients with fever (p<0.001) were overrepresented in the virus-positive group. Furthermore, viral findings in NPA were associated with upper respiratory symptoms (URTS) (p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Both respiratory viral infections and low titers of viruses in blood from patients with neutropenia were common. Patients with CLL and patients with fever were independently associated to these infections, and viral findings in NPA were associated to URTS indicating active infection. These findings motivate further studies on viruses' impact on this patient category and their potential role as causative agents of fever during neutropenia.","Öhrmalm, Lars; Wong, Michelle; Aust, Carl; Ljungman, Per; Norbeck, Oscar; Broliden, Kristina; Tolfvenstam, Thomas",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0036543; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22570724/,495

In particular, the ingestion of hyperimmune bovine colostrum has been proposed as an alternative preventive approach against human rotavirus gastroenteritis. Although the immunization of pregnant cows with human rotavirus boosts the release of specific immunoglobulin G in bovine colostrum, it raises regulatory and safety issues. In this study, we demonstrated that the conventional bovine rotavirus vaccine is sufficient to enhance the anti-human rotavirus protective efficacy of bovine colostrum, thus providing a conservative approach to produce hyperimmune bovine colostrum, making it exploitable as a functional food.","Civra, Andrea; Altomare, Alessandra; Francese, Rachele; Donalisio, Manuela; Aldini, Giancarlo; Lembo, David",J Dairy Sci,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022030219303443; https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2018-16016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981494/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022030219303443,495

This feasibility study looks at one such technology, upper-room ultraviolet (UV) air disinfection, that can be safely used while humans are present in the room space, and which has already proven its efficacy as an intervention to inhibit the transmission of airborne diseases such as measles and tuberculosis. Using published data from various sources, it is shown that the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the causative agent of COVID-19, is highly likely to be susceptible to UV-C damage when suspended in air, with a UV susceptibility constant likely to be in the region 0.377–0.590 m(2)/J, similar to that for other aerosolised coronaviruses. As such, the UV-C flux required to disinfect the virus is expected to be acceptable and safe for upper-room applications. Through analysis of expected and worst-case scenarios, the efficacy of the upper-room UV-C approach for reducing COVID-19 transmission in confined spaces (with moderate but sufficient ceiling height) is demonstrated.

This study aimed to examine the livelihoods, coping strategies, and access to healthcare among SR based on registration status and accompanying formal assistance. A mixed-method approach with more emphasis on the qualitative design was adopted. A purposive convenient sampling approach was used to recruit SR from informal tented settlements (ITS) in the Beqaa region in Lebanon. Data collection included 19 focus group discussions (FGDs) that were conducted with participants, who were further divided into three groups: registered refugees with assistance, registered without assistance and unregistered. Twelve in-depth interviews were conducted with key informants from humanitarian organizations. All interviews and FGDs were audio recorded, transcribed, and thematically analyzed. SR were highly dependent on formal assistance when received, albeit being insufficient. Regardless of registration status, refugees resorted to informal livelihood strategies, including informal employment, child labor, early marriage, and accruing debt. Poor living conditions and food insecurity were reported among all SR. Limited healthcare access and high out-of-pocket costs led to limited use of antenatal care services, prioritizing life-threatening conditions, and resorting to alternative sources of healthcare. Severity of these conditions and their adverse health consequences were especially pronounced among unregistered refugees. Our findings shed light on the economic and health disparities among marginalized SR, with the lack of registration and formal assistance increasing their vulnerability. More tailored and sustainable humanitarian programs are needed to target the most vulnerable and hard-to-reach groups.","Nabulsi, Dana; Ismail, Hussein; Abou Hassan, Fida; Sacca, Lea; Honein-AbouHaidar, Gladys; Jomaa, Lamis",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33264293/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0242421,495

This overstretched situation has been greatly aggravated since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of the study is to analyse the prevalence of burnout among primary care physicians and to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on burnout. Methods: This was a multicentre longitudinal descriptive study of occupational factors and burnout before and since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to assess the impact of the pandemic on burnout in primary care physicians, two paired groups of physicians were compared using Wilcoxon’s and McNemar’s tests. Results: In January 2019, 10% of primary care physicians scored high on all burnout domains. Seven months into the COVID-19 pandemic (October 2020), this percentage increased to 50%. Paired groups analysis showed unprecedented worsening due to the pandemic: emotional exhaustion, which already affected 55% of primary care physicians, jumped to 77%. Conclusions: Burnout is endemic among primary care physicians. It has been associated with lower patient satisfaction, reduced health outcomes, and increased costs.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to detect the accuracy and effectiveness of telemedicine as an assessment tool for triage compared to physical assessment. METHODS: In a random sample of 1,086 COVID-19 positive cases during the pandemic in Dubai, all the patients were initially assessed by trained staff using telemedicine following a standardized guidelines and accordingly action was taken by sending the patient to an isolation facility or for hospital admission; the second phase of assessment was conducted physically at the facility. We compared the accuracy of assessment by telemedicine encounter versus physical assessment by detecting any changes of the initial action within 12 h. RESULTS: Telemedicine was accurate in 1,080 out of 1,086 screened patients (99.4%). DISCUSSION: Telemedicine offers fast and convenient response to patients needs with standardization of triage guidelines. Telemedicine has reduced exposure of the medical workers which reduced the possibility of infection as well as reduction of crowds at the medical centers. RECOMMENDATIONS: Telemedicine is very useful during the COVID-19 pandemic for following up the positive and suspected cases as well as cases with history of close contact with a confirmed positive case.","Elhennawy, Amr; Alsalem, Fateh Almohammed; Bahri, Salah; Alarfaj, Noor",Dubai Medical Journal,https://doi.org/10.1159/000514024,495

The objectives of this study were to identify the mechanisms used by MHV type 3 to modulate the production of IFN-γ by NK cells during the acute hepatitis in susceptible C57BL/6 mice. Ex vivo and in vitro experiments revealed that NK cells, expressing carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules (CEACAM) 1a (the MHV receptor), can produce a higher level of IFN-γ in the presence of both L2-MHV3 and interleukin-12 (IL-12)/IL-18. The synergistic production of IFN-γ by NK cells depends on viral replication rather than viral fixation only, because it is inhibited or not induced in cells infected with ultraviolet-inactivated viruses and in cells from Ceacam1a(−/−) mice infected with virulent viruses. The synergistic IFN-γ production involves the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) rather than the extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 MAPK signalling pathway. However, the signal triggered through the engagement of CEACAM1a decreases the production of IFN-γ, when these molecules are cross-linked using specific monoclonal antibodies. These results suggest that control of acute hepatitis by IFN-γ-producing NK cells may depend on both production of IL-12 and IL-18 in the liver environment and viral infection of NK cells.","Jacques, Alexandre; Bleau, Christian; Turbide, Claire; Beauchemin, Nicole; Lamontagne, Lucie",Immunology,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2567.2008.03030.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19740316/,495

It plays a key role in the access of the virus into the cell to produce the final infection. In the present study we investigated in silico the basic mechanism of ACE2 in the lung and provided evidences for new potentially effective drugs for Covid-19. Specifically, we used the gene expression profiles from public datasets including The Cancer Genome Atlas, Gene Expression Omnibus and Genotype-Tissue Expression, Gene Ontology and pathway enrichment analysis to investigate the main functions of ACE2-correlated genes. We constructed a protein-protein interaction network containing the genes co-expressed with ACE2. Finally, we focused on the genes in the network that are already associated with known drugs and evaluated their role for a potential treatment of Covid-19. Our results demonstrate that the genes correlated with ACE2 are mainly enriched in the sterol biosynthetic process, Aryldialkylphosphatase activity, adenosylhomocysteinase activity, trialkylsulfonium hydrolase activity, acetate-CoA and CoA ligase activity. We identified a network of 193 genes, 222 interactions and 36 potential drugs that could have a crucial role.

And the high expression of SLY was required for the epidemic strain to cause NLRP3 hyperactivation, which is essential for the induction of cytokines storm, dysfunction of multiple organs, and a high incidence of mortality, the characters of streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome (STSLS). However, it remains to be elucidated whether acquiring high SLY expression due to genome evolution was sufficient for the non-epidemic strain to cause STSLS. Here, we found that the overexpression of SLY in ST1 strain (P1/7-SLY) could obviously increase the inflammasome activation, which was dependent on NLRP3 signalling. In contrast, the strain (P1/7-mSLY) overexpressing the mutant SLY (protein without hemolytic activity) could not significantly increase the inflammasome activation. Furthermore, similar to the epidemic strain, P1/7-SLY could cause STSLS in nlrp3(+/+) mice but not in nlrp3(−/−) mice. In contrast, P1/7-mSLY could not cause STSLS in both nlrp3 (+/+) mice and nlrp3(−/−) mice. In summary, we demonstrate that genetic evolution enabling S. suis strain to express high level of SLY may be an essential and sufficient condition for NLRP3 inflammasome hyperactivation, which could further cause cytokines storm and STSLS.","Xu, Lei; Lin, Lan; Lu, Xi; Xiao, Peng; Liu, Ran; Wu, Meizhou; Jin, Meilin; Zhang, Anding",Emerging microbes & infections,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33792531/; https://doi.org/10.1080/22221751.2021.1908098,495

Our primary aim was to study the relationship between adolescents’ resilience and their participation in online sports programs during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown period. Our secondary aims were to assess the associations between the organized sports programs’ determinants and resilience. Methods: Online surveys designed to examine resilience, lifestyle, psychosocial health and characteristics of the organized sports programs were administered to 473 adolescents who were enrolled in organized sports programs before the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Adolescents who continued to participate in online structured programs during the lockdown period were significantly more resilient and physically active, had higher self-related health, satisfaction with life, and ability to cope during the pandemic, compared to those who did not participate.

607767,Orchestration of dreams: a possible tool for enhancement of mental productivity and efficiency,2021-01-27,"BACKGROUND: To date, influenza epidemics have been considered suitable for use as a model for the COVID-19 epidemic, given that they are respiratory diseases with similar modes of transmission. However, data directly comparing the two diseases are scarce. METHODS: We did a nationwide retrospective cohort study using the French national administrative database (PMSI), which includes discharge summaries for all hospital admissions in France. All patients hospitalised for COVID-19 from March 1 to April 30, 2020, and all patients hospitalised for influenza between Dec 1, 2018, and Feb 28, 2019, were included. The diagnosis of COVID-19 (International Classification of Diseases [10th edition] codes U07.10, U07.11, U07.12, U07.14, or U07.15) or influenza (J09, J10, or J11) comprised primary, related, or associated diagnosis. Comparisons of risk factors, clinical characteristics, and outcomes between patients hospitalised for COVID-19 and influenza were done, with data also stratified by age group. FINDINGS: 89 530 patients with COVID-19 and 45 819 patients with influenza were hospitalised in France during the respective study periods. The median age of patients was 68 years (IQR 52–82) for COVID-19 and 71 years (34–84) for influenza. Patients with COVID-19 were more frequently obese or overweight, and more frequently had diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidaemia than patients with influenza, whereas those with influenza more frequently had heart failure, chronic respiratory disease, cirrhosis, and deficiency anaemia. Patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 more frequently developed acute respiratory failure, pulmonary embolism, septic shock, or haemorrhagic stroke than patients with influenza, but less frequently developed myocardial infarction or atrial fibrillation. In-hospital mortality was higher in patients with COVID-19 than in patients with influenza (15 104 [16·9%] of 89 530 vs 2640 [5·8%] of 45 819), with a relative risk of death of 2·9 (95% CI 2·8–3·0) and an age-standardised mortality ratio of 2·82. Of the patients hospitalised, the proportion of paediatric patients (<18 years) was smaller for COVID-19 than for influenza (1227 [1·4%] vs 8942 [19·5%]), but a larger proportion of patients younger than 5 years needed intensive care support for COVID-19 than for influenza (14 [2·3%] of 613 vs 65 [0·9%] of 6973). In adolescents (11–17 years), the in-hospital mortality was ten-times higher for COVID-19 than for influenza (five [1·1% of 458 vs one [0·1%] of 804), and patients with COVID-19 were more frequently obese or overweight. INTERPRETATION: The presentation of patients with COVID-19 and seasonal influenza requiring hospitalisation differs considerably. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is likely to have a higher potential for respiratory pathogenicity, leading to more respiratory complications and to higher mortality. In children, although the rate of hospitalisation for COVID-19 appears to be lower than for influenza, in-hospital mortality is higher; however, low patient numbers limit this finding. These findings highlight the importance of appropriate preventive measures for COVID-19, as well as the need for a specific vaccine and treatment.

It is a competence that can improve self-care, adherence and overall health. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the need for information and has also reduced the number of visits to health centers. Nurses have had to adapt in order to continue offering quality care in different environments such as the digital world, but this entails assessing the level of their patients’ empowerment and adapting material and educational messages to new realities. The aim of this study is, on the one hand, to assess nurses’ use of digital resources to provide reinforcing information to their patients and, on the other hand, to evaluate how they assess the level of empowerment of their patients. To perform the study, 850 nurses answered 21 questions related to their own digital literacy and patients’ empowerment. The ability to make decisions is the characteristic most selected by nurses (70%) as useful in measuring patient empowerment, whereas 9.19% do not measure it in any way. Printed material is most often used by nurses to offer additional information to patients (71.93%), mobile applications are the least used option (21.58%), and elder nurses are those who most recommend digital resources. In this study, younger nurses make little or no use of technology as a resource for training and monitoring patients. In spite of some limitations concerning the study, digital health needs to be promoted as an indisputable tool in the nurse’s briefcase in the future to ensure that older patients can manage electronic resources in different fields.","Navarro Martínez, Olga; Igual García, Jorge; Traver Salcedo, Vicente",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34574766/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18189844,495

METHODS: A total of 128 BE neonates and 128 normal neonates were included. The serum samples of the BE children and controls were collected, and the levels of IL-1β and TGF-β were examined. Moreover, the correlation between the level of bilirubin and serum expression of IL-1β or TGF-β in BE patients was analyzed. Finally, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to determine the diagnostic value of the cytokines. RESULTS: IL-1β and TGF-β levels were higher in the serum of BE patients than those in non-BE patients, and the expression of either IL-1β or TGF-β showed a strong positive correlation with the serum expression of bilirubin in BE patients. Moreover, the results of ROC analysis showed that either IL-1β or TGF-β could distinguish BE patients from healthy controls. CONCLUSION: IL-1β and TGF-β levels were upregulated in BE and might function as potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets for BE patients.","Guan, Hanzhou; Wang, Chenghu; Zhang, Xinhua",Clinics (Sao Paulo),https://doi.org/10.6061/clinics/2020/e1868; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33263631/,495

Materials and methods The UK Neurointerventional Group (UKNG) and the British Society of Neuroradiologists (BSNR) sent out a national survey on 1 May 2020 to all 28 UK neuroscience centres that have the potential capability to perform MT. Results Responses were received from 27/28 MT-capable centres (96%). Three of the 27 centres do not currently provide MT services. There was a 27.7% reduction in MTs performed during April 2020 compared with the first 3 months of the year. All MT patients in 20/24 centres that responded were considered as COVID-19 suspicious/positive unless or until proven otherwise. Twenty-two of the 24 centres reported delays to the patient pathway. Seventeen of the 24 centres reported that the COVID-19 pandemic had reduced training opportunities for specialist registrars (SpR). Fourteen of the 24 centres reported that the pandemic had hampered their development plans for their local or regional MT service. Conclusion The present survey has highlighted a trend of decreasing cases and delays in the patient pathway during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic across UK centres.","McConachie, D.; McConachie, N.; White, P.; Crossley, R.; Izzath, W.",Clin Radiol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009926020302658?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crad.2020.07.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32682524/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0009926020302658,495
609658,COVID-19 and ear endoscopy in otologic practices,2020-09-02,"In February 2020 a substitution at the interface between SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein subunits, Spike D614G, was observed in public databases. The Spike 614G variant subsequently increased in frequency in many locations throughout the world. Global patterns of dispersal of Spike 614G are suggestive of a selective advantage of this variant, however the origin of Spike 614G is associated with early colonization events in Europe and subsequent radiations to the rest of the world. Increasing frequency of 614G may therefore be due to a random founder effect. We investigate the hypothesis for positive selection of Spike 614G at the level of an individual country, the United Kingdom, using more than 25,000 whole genome SARS-CoV-2 sequences collected by COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium. Using phylogenetic analysis, we identify Spike 614G and 614D clades with unique origins in the UK and from these we extrapolate and compare growth rates of co-circulating transmission clusters. We find that Spike 614G clusters are introduced in the UK later on average than 614D clusters and grow to larger size after adjusting for time of introduction. Phylodynamic analysis does not show a significant increase in growth rates for clusters with the 614G variant, but population genetic modelling indicates that 614G increases in frequency relative to 614D in a manner consistent with a selective advantage. We also investigate the potential influence of Spike 614D versus G on virulence by matching a subset of records to clinical data on patient outcomes. We do not find any indication that patients infected with the Spike 614G variant have higher COVID-19 mortality, but younger patients have slightly increased odds of 614G carriage. Despite the availability of a very large data set, well represented by both Spike 614 variants, not all approaches showed a conclusive signal of higher transmission rate for 614G, but significant differences in growth, size, and composition of these lineages indicate a need for continued study.","Volz, Erik M; Hill, Verity; McCrone, John T; Price, Anna; Jorgensen, David; O039, Aine; Toole,; Southgate, Joel Alexander; Johnson, Robert; Jackson, Ben; Nascimento, Fabricia F.; Rey, Sara M.; Nicholls, Samuel M.; Colquhoun, Rachel M.; Filipe, Ana da Silva; Shepherd, James G; Pascall, David J; Shah, Rajiv; Jesudason, Natasha; Li, Kathy; Jarrett, Ruth; Pacchiarini, Nicole; Bull, Matthew; Geidelberg, Lily; Siveroni, Igor; Goodfellow, Ian G.; Loman, Nicholas James; Pybus, Oliver; Robertson, David L; Thomson, Emma C; Rambaut, Andrew; Connor, Thomas R; Consortium, - The COVID-19 Genomics UK",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.31.20166082; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.31.20166082v1?rss=1,495

Even though the peptide drugs are known since 1920 in association with the clinical use of insulin, only a limited number of peptides are currently used for therapeutics due to various disadvantages associated with them such as limited serum and blood stability, oral bioavailability, and permeability. Since, through chemical modifications and structure tuning, many of these limitations can be overcome, peptide-based drugs are gaining attention in pharmaceutical research. As of today, there are more than 60 peptide-based drugs approved by FDA, and over 150 peptides are in the advanced clinical studies.

610349,Variation in approaches to antimicrobial use surveillance in high-income secondary care settings: a systematic review,2021-04-24,"Viral fitness is determined by replication within hosts and transmission between them. We examine how pleiotropic mutations that have antagonistic effects (i.e., antibody evasion vs. receptor binding) on viral replication within hosts can impact viral immune escape in the host population. When the host population is vaccinated, the virus escapes from passive immunity by mutations in the antibody-binding region on the surface of the target protein. However, the reduced ability of the antibody to bind the virus is often accompanied by a reduced ability of the virus to bind the cell receptor because the antibody-binding region overlaps with the receptor-binding domain (RBD). The types of permitted mutations are limited. To investigate the causal relation between a mutation in a viral genome and adaptive evolution of a viral population, we developed a mathematical model that describes the population dynamics of viruses, antibodies, and normal/infected cells within a host. The coefficients describe the binding affinity between the virus and the induced antibody and that between the virus and its receptor. Our knowledge-based index enables us to estimate the effect of a mutation in a binding region on the binding affinity. Using population genetic theory, we evaluated the probability that a mutant is fixed in a host population. The mutations that can be fixed with high probabilities may determine how long a vaccine remains effective. We simulate the adaptive evolution of coronavirus, the etiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome, and show that some of mutations in the RBD may have high fixation probabilities in the vaccinated host population.","Watabe, Teruaki; Kishino, Hirohisa",Mol Biol Evol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20194425/; https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msq056,495
610569,The burnout and workload impact on recurrent COVID‐19: Analysis of two healthcare professionals,2021-07-06,"BACKGROUND: Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an emerging virus that infects humans and camels with no approved antiviral therapy or vaccine. Some vaccines are in development for camels as a one-health intervention where vaccinating camels is proposed to reduce human viral exposure. This intervention will require an understanding of the prior exposure of camels to the virus and appropriate vaccine efficacy studies in camels. METHODS: We conducted a cross sectional seroprevalence study in young dromedary camels to determine the rate of MERS-CoV seropositivity in young camels. Next, we utilised naturally infected camels as a natural challenge model that can be used by co-housing these camels with healthy naive camels in a ratio of 1 to 2. This model is aimed to support studies on natural virus transmission as well as evaluating drug and vaccine efficacy. RESULTS: We found that 90% of the screened camels have pre-existing antibodies for MERS-CoV. In addition, the challenge model resulted in MERS-CoV transmission within 48 h with infections that continued for 14 days post challenge. CONCLUSIONS: Our finding suggests that the majority of young dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia are seropositive and that naturally infected camels can serve as a challenge model to assess transmission, therapeutics, and vaccine efficacy.","Alharbi, Naif Khalaf; Ibrahim, Osman H.; Alhafufi, Ali; Kasem, Samy; Aldowerij, Ali; Albrahim, Raed; Abu-obaidah, Ali; Alkarar, Ali; Bayoumi, Faisal Altaib; Almansour, Ali Mohammed; Aldubaib, Musaad; Al-Abdely, Hail M.; Balkhy, Hanan H.; Qasim, Ibrahim",Virol J,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-020-01347-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32552831/,495

While these treatments can improve patient's recovery and survival, these therapeutic strategies do not lead to unequivocal restoration of the lung damage inflicted by this disease. Stem cell therapies and, more recently, their secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs), are emerging as new promising treatments, which could attenuate inflammation but also regenerate the lung damage caused by COVID-19. Stem cells exert their immunomodulatory, anti-oxidant, and reparative therapeutic effects likely through their EVs, and therefore, could be beneficial, alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents, in people with COVID-19. In this review article, we outline the mechanisms of cytokine storm and lung damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus leading to COVID-19 disease and how mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and their secreted EVs can be utilized to tackle this damage by harnessing their regenerative properties, which gives them potential enhanced clinical utility compared to other investigated pharmacological treatments.

Legionellosis incidence is on the rise and is expected to keep increasing as global challenges become a reality. This puts great emphasis on prevention, which must be grounded in strengthened Legionella management practices. Herein, an overview of field-based studies (the system as a test rig) is provided to unravel the common roots of research and the main contributions to Legionella’s understanding. The perpetuation of a water-focused monitoring approach and the importance of protozoa and biofilms will then be discussed as bottom-line questions for reliable Legionella real-field surveillance. Finally, an integrated monitoring model is proposed to study and control Legionella in water systems by combining discrete and continuous information about water and biofilm. Although the successful implementation of such a model requires a broader discussion across the scientific community and practitioners, this might be a starting point to build more consistent Legionella management strategies that can effectively mitigate legionellosis risks by reinforcing a pro-active Legionella prevention philosophy.","Pereira, Ana; Silva, Ana Rosa; Melo, Luis F.",Microorganisms,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34205095/; https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms9061212,495

Antibiotic prescriptions were analyzed and quantified, using Defined Daily Doses (DDD) per admission and per 100 bed days. Possible drivers of antibiotic prescribing were identified by means of mixed effects logistic modelling analysis with backwards selection. Of all included admissions (n = 429), 39% (n = 171) were prescribed antibiotics for (presumed) respiratory tract superinfection (3.6 DDD/admission; 31.5 DDD/100 bed days). Consumption of beta-lactamase inhibitor–penicillin combinations was the highest (2.55 DDD/admission; 23.3 DDD/100 bed days). Four drivers were identified: fever on admission (OR 2.97; 95% CI 1.42–6.22), lower SpO(2)/FiO(2) ratio on admission (OR 0.96; 95% CI 0.92–0.99), underlying pulmonary disease (OR 3.04; 95% CI 1.12–8.27) and longer hospital stay (OR 1.09; 95% CI 1.03–1.16). We present detailed quantitative antibiotic data for presumed respiratory tract superinfections in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. In addition to knowledge on antibiotic consumption, we hope antimicrobial stewardship programs will be able to use the drivers identified in this study to optimize their interventions in COVID-19 wards.

The consequences of initial exposure to SARS-CoV-2 go beyond pulmonary damage, with a particular impact on lipid metabolism. Decreased levels in HDL-C were reported in COVID-19 patients. Since HDL particles display antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and potential anti-infectious properties, we aimed at characterizing HDL proteome and functionality during COVID-19 relative to healthy subjects. HDLs were isolated from plasma of 8 severe COVID-19 patients sampled at admission to intensive care unit (Day 1, D1) at D3 and D7, and from 16 sex- and age-matched healthy subjects. Proteomic analysis was performed by LC-MS/MS. The relative amounts of proteins identified in HDLs were compared between COVID-19 and controls. apolipoprotein A-I and paraoxonase 1 were confirmed by Western-blot analysis to be less abundant in COVID-19 versus controls, whereas serum amyloid A and alpha-1 antitrypsin were higher. HDLs from patients were less protective in endothelial cells stiumalted by TNFα (permeability, VE-cadherin disorganization and apoptosis). In these conditions, HDL inhibition of apoptosis was blunted in COVID-19 relative to controls. In conclusion, we show major changes in HDL proteome and decreased functionality in severe COVID-19 patients.","Begue, Floran; Tanaka, Sébastien; Mouktadi, Zarouki; Rondeau, Philippe; Veeren, Bryan; Diotel, Nicolas; Tran-Dinh, Alexy; Robert, Tiphaine; Vélia, Erick; Mavingui, Patrick; Lagrange-Xélot, Marie; Montravers, Philippe; Couret, David; Meilhac, Olivier",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33504824/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-81638-1,495

However, in some infected individuals, this can progress to severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to multi-organ failure and death. The purpose of this study is to explore the proteomic differences between mild, severe and critical COVID-19 positive patients. Blood protein profiling was performed on 59 COVID-19 mild (n=26), severe (n=9) or critical (n=24) cases and 28 controls using the OLINK inflammation, autoimmune, cardiovascular and neurology panels. Differential expression analysis was performed within and between disease groups to generate nine different analyses. From the 368 proteins measured per individual, more than 75% were observed to be significantly perturbed in COVID-19 cases. Six proteins (IL6, CKAP4, Gal-9, IL-1ra, LILRB4 and PD-L1) were identified to be associated with disease severity. The results have been made readily available through an interactive web-based application for instant data exploration and visualization, and can be accessed at https://phidatalab-shiny.rosalind.kcl.ac.uk/COVID19/. Our results demonstrate that dynamic changes in blood proteins that associate with disease severity can potentially be used as early biomarkers to monitor disease severity in COVID-19 and serve as potential therapeutic targets.","Patel, H.; Ashton, N.

Interstitial pneumonitis is a rare adverse event of imatinib therapy. It is clinically difficult to distinguish from infectious pneumonia, which can frequently occur due to the underlying disease. The standard treatment for imatinib-induced pneumonitis is to discontinue the medication and optionally administer corticosteroids. However, there are a few cases of successful retrial with imatinib.

The individual response to MSCs treatment is heterogeneous. During the treatment of infectious pathology, the effectiveness of the treatment may vary based on the disease scenario. Interestingly, when transplanted in vivo, MSCs are governed by the locally regulated microenvironment, suggesting that the restorative variability could be tailored by choosing a priming regimen to specifically correct a given pathology.

Dental education programmes and academic activities have suffered from the ramifications of the pandemic. This study aimed to depict the impacts of the COVID‐19 epidemic on the clinical services and academic activities in the department of stomatology of a tertiary hospital in Wuhan, China. METHODS: We obtained historical data of the Department of Stomatology from the Health Information System of the General Hospital of Central Theater Command, Wuhan, China between January 2018 and June 2020. Mean, standard deviation and median with interquartile range were used to summarize the variables. Line plots were used to illustrate the temporal trend. The Kruskal‐Wallis equality‐of‐populations rank test was used to compare the difference between groups. RESULTS: A significant decrease was noted in the monthly average number of patients seeking outpatient services for the year 2020, which were decreased by two‐thirds from 2018 to 2020. The number of emergency cases also decreased significantly by 57.6% in 2020. The monthly number of teaching hours decreased from 3.8 ± 1.5 in 2018 and 4.7 ± 1.4 in 2019 to 1.7 ± 1.9 in 2020. The number of interns also decreased by more than 77.0% in 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The impacts of COVID‐19 in the stomatology clinic were significant with notable decreases in clinical services and education offered to the stomatology students.

This study aims to understand to impact of COVID-19 on PHC delivery and antibiotic prescribing at community level in the rural areas of central China. Methods Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 PHC practitioners and seven patients recruited from two township health centres (THCs) and nine village clinics (VCs) in two rural residential areas of Anhui province. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed. Results Practitioners' and patients' views and perspectives on COVID-19 impacts on PHC services and antibiotic prescribing are organised into four broad themes: switch from PHC to epidemic prevention and control, concerns and challenges faced by those delivering PHC, diminished PHC, and COVID-19 as a different class of illness. Conclusion The COVID-19 epidemic has had a considerable impact on the roles of rural PHC clinics in China that shifted to public health from principal medical, and highlighted the difficulties in rural PHC including inadequately trained practitioners, additional work and financial pressure, particularly in VCs. Antibiotic prescribing practices for non-COVID-19 respiratory tract infections remained unchanged since the knowledge of COVID-19 was not seen as relevant to practitioners' antibiotic treatment practices, although overall rates were reduced because fewer patients were attending rural PHC clinics. Since COVID-19 epidemic control work has been designated as a long-term task in China, rural PHC clinics now face the challenge of how to balance their principal clinical and public health roles and, in the case of the VCs, remain financially viable.

620742,Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on management of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases in Morocco,2020-11-16,"PURPOSE: High-resolution free-breathing late gadolinium enhancement (HR-LGE) was shown valuable for the diagnosis of acute coronary syndromes with non-obstructed coronary arteries. The method may be useful to detect COVID-related myocardial injuries but is hampered by prolonged acquisition times. We aimed to introduce an accelerated HR-LGE technique for the diagnosis of COVID-related myocardial injuries. METHOD: An undersampled navigator-gated HR-LGE (acquired resolution of 1.25mm(3)) sequence combined with advanced patch-based low-rank reconstruction was developed and validated in a phantom and in 23 patients with structural heart disease (test cohort; 15 men; 55±16 years). Twenty patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection associated with troponin rise (COVID cohort; 15 men; 46±24 years) prospectively underwent cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) with the proposed sequence in our center. Image sharpness, quality, signal intensity differences and diagnostic value of free-breathing HR-LGE were compared against conventional breath-held low-resolution LGE (LR-LGE, voxel size 1.8x1.4x6mm). RESULTS: Structures sharpness in the phantom showed no differences with the fully sampled image up to an undersampling factor of x3.8 (P>0.5). In patients (N=43), this acceleration allowed for acquisition times of 7min21s±1min12s at 1.25mm(3) resolution. Compared with LR-LGE, HR-LGE showed higher image quality (P=0.03) and comparable signal intensity differences (P>0.5). In patients with structural heart disease, all LGE-positive segments on LR-LGE were also detected on HR-LGE (80/391) with 21 additional enhanced segments visible only on HR-LGE (101/391, P<0.001). In 4 patients with COVID-19 history, HR-LGE was definitely positive while LR-LGE was either definitely negative (1 microinfarction and 1 myocarditis) or inconclusive (2 myocarditis). CONCLUSIONS: Undersampled free-breathing isotropic HR-LGE can detect additional areas of late enhancement as compared to conventional breath-held LR-LGE. In patients with history of COVID-19 infection associated with troponin rise, the method allows for detailed characterization of myocardial injuries in acceptable scan times and without the need for repeated breath holds.","Bustin, Aurélien; Sridi, Soumaya; Gravinay, Pierre; Legghe, Benoit; Gosse, Philippe; Ouattara, Alexandre; Rozé, Hadrien; Coste, Pierre; Gerbaud, Edouard; Desclaux, Arnaud; Boyer, Alexandre; Prevel, Renaud; Gruson, Didier; Bonnet, Fabrice; Issa, Nahema; Montaudon, Michel; Laurent, Francois; Stuber, Matthias; Camou, Fabrice; Cochet, Hubert",Eur J Radiol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0720048X21004411; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34600236/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0720048X21004411?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrad.2021.109960,495

Bangladesh has been sufferring from dengue outbreaks almost annually since 2000, and in 2019, Bangladesh faced the worst outbreak of dengue to date. This study aimed to provide clinical and biochemical profiles of Bangladesh's dengue-infected patients. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted from August through December 2019 in three tertiary private hospitals in Dhaka, Bangladesh. We collected information on demographic data, clinical characteristics, and laboratory profiles for 542 confirmed hospitalized acute dengue cases using a structured questionnaire. RESULTS: The average age of the enrolled patients was 26.15 years, and about 50% of patients belonged to the age group of 20–40 years. The most frequent among the prevalent clinical symptoms were fever (93.1%), abdominal pain (29.5%), skin rash (25.3%), and diarrhea (19.7%). 316 patients had some complications, such as breathing problems (41.4%), pleural effusion (38.9%), gum bleeding (11.1%), etc. More than 90% of the patients showed seropositivity for the DENV-NS1 antigen. CONCLUSIONS: Over the last couple of years, dengue fever has become a major health issue for Bangladesh. To reduce the burden of this disease, timely diagnosis and prompt treatment are necessary. This analysis thus yields the clinical features, laboratory profiles, and seropositivity test results of dengue patients from Bangladesh. The research results may help clinicians understand the circumstantial diagnosis of dengue patients and facilitate early intervention.","Mahmood, Rudbar; Benzadid, Md.

Study objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of BNT162b2 vaccine in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related hospitalization and mortality. METHODS: This historical cohort study included members of a large health provider in Israel that were vaccinated with at least one dose of BNT162b2. The primary outcome was incidence rate of a SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed with rt-PCR, between 7 to 27 days after second dose (protection-period), as compared to days 1 to 7 after the first dose, where no protection by the vaccine is assumed (reference-period). RESULTS: Data of 1,178,597 individuals vaccinated with BNT162b2 were analyzed (mean age 47.7 years [SD=18.1], 48.4% males) of whom 872,454 (74.0%) reached the protection period. Overall, 4514 infections occurred during the reference period compared to 728 during the protection period, yielding a weighted mean daily incidence of 54.8 per 100,000 (95%CI: 26.1-115.0 per 100,000) and 5.4 per 100,000 (95%CI: 3.5-8.4 per 100,000), respectively. The vaccine effectiveness in preventing infection was 90% (95%CI:79%- 95%) and 94% (95%CI:88%-97%) against COVID-19. Among immunosuppressed patients, vaccine effectiveness against infection was 71% (95%CI:37%-87%).

METHODS: We have performed an extensive literature search for articles in PubMed, EMBASE and Google Scholar databases till April 25, 2020, with the following keywords: “COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV-2”, “diabetes”, “diabetes mellitus”, “SARS”, “infection” and “management of diabetes mellitus” with interposition of the Boolean operator “AND”. RESULTS: Compromised innate immunity, pro-inflammatory cytokine milieu, reduced expression of ACE2 and use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system antagonists in people with DM contribute to poor prognosis in COVID-19. On the contrary, direct β-cell damage, cytokine-induced insulin resistance, hypokalemia and drugs used in the treatment of COVID-19 (like corticosteroids, lopinavir/ritonavir) can contribute to worsening of glucose control in people with diabetes mellitus. CONCLUSIONS: The two-way interaction between COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus sets up a vicious cycle wherein COVID-19 leads to worsening of dysglycemia and diabetes mellitus, in turn, exacerbates the severity of COVID-19.

This study aims to explore the work situation of physicians and residents in internal medical rheumatology, considering the impact of the coronavirus pandemic COVID-19. METHODS: A questionnaire-based online survey was conducted in early 2021 at the Hannover Medical School, supported by the German Society of Rheumatology. Target groups were all rheumatology physicians and residents in Germany. The main areas of investigation included work hours, task delegation, and collaboration; workload and mental health issues; discrimination and sexual harassment experiences; and the impact of COVID-19. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed for the standardized items and qualitative content analysis for the free-text information. RESULTS: The respondents (n = 101) expressed positive attitudes towards cooperation and task delegation to medical assistants, especially those specialized in rheumatology, while attitudes towards cooperation with GPs pointed to blockades. There was a strong mismatch between actual and desired work hours both in the group of women and in the group of men. 81% rated their workload as high or very high; every sixth rheumatologist has suffered from stress or burnout syndromes at least once in the past. Experiences of gender discrimination and sexual harassment/violence were frequently reported, mostly by women. COVID-19 was an amplifier of stress, with major stressors being digitalization and increased demand for communication and patient education.

Cases of rhabdomyolysis as the initial presentation of SLE are rare, and there are no reported cases of SLE presenting hyponatremia-associated rhabdomyolysis as the first manifestation. Herein, we report a case of SLE with lupus nephritis in a patient with acute hyponatremia-associated rhabdomyolysis. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 44-year-old woman was admitted with complaints of altered consciousness, myalgia, and red-brownish urine that first appeared three days prior. Peripheral blood tests revealed elevated creatine kinase (19,013 IU/L) and myoglobin (5099 U/L) levels and severe hyponatremia (111 mEq/L) with no azotemia. Urinalysis showed nephritic sediments.

Serological evaluation revealed the presence of anti-nuclear (speckled pattern, 1:640), anti-double stranded DNA, and anti-Smith antibodies and absence of anti-Jo-1 antibody. A kidney biopsy demonstrated mesangial proliferative (class II) lupus nephritis. INTERVENTIONS: Fluid therapy, including intravenous administration of 3% NaCl, was initiated. After three consecutive days of intravenous methylprednisolone (1 g/d), oral prednisolone (1 mg/kg/d), mycophenolate mofetil, and hydroxychloroquine were administered. OUTCOMES: On day 28, the patient was discharged with marked resolution of SLE-associated symptoms and laboratory findings. Lupus reactivation was not present during the subsequent six-month follow-up. LESSONS: Hyponatremia-associated rhabdomyolysis can be the first manifestation of SLE. Moreover, prompt fluid therapy and timely administration of immunosuppressive agents in SLE patients presenting with hyponatremia and rhabdomyolysis can significantly help alleviate disease activity and improve clinical outcomes.","Lee, In Hee; Cho, Seong; Ahn, Dong Jik; Kim, Min-Kyung",Medicine (Baltimore),https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000027390; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34596163/,495
624571,Trends in mortality of hospitalised COVID-19 patients: a single centre observational cohort study from Spain,2021-01-24,"Phylogenetic analyses have provided strong evidence that amino acid changes in spike (S) protein of animal and human SARS coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) during and between two zoonotic transfers (2002/03 and 2003/04) are the result of positive selection. While several studies support that some amino acid changes between animal and human viruses are the result of inter-species adaptation, the role of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) in driving SARS-CoV evolution, particularly during intra-species transmission, is unknown. A detailed examination of SARS-CoV infected animal and human convalescent sera could provide evidence of nAb pressure which, if found, may lead to strategies to effectively block virus evolution pathways by broadening the activity of nAbs. Here we show, by focusing on a dominant neutralization epitope, that contemporaneous- and cross-strain nAb responses against SARS-CoV spike protein exist during natural infection. In vitro immune pressure on this epitope using 2002/03 strain-specific nAb 80R recapitulated a dominant escape mutation that was present in all 2003/04 animal and human viruses. Strategies to block this nAb escape/naturally occurring evolution pathway by generating broad nAbs (BnAbs) with activity against 80R escape mutants and both 2002/03 and 2003/04 strains were explored. Structure-based amino acid changes in an activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) “hot spot” in a light chain CDR (complementarity determining region) alone, introduced through shuffling of naturally occurring non-immune human VL chain repertoire or by targeted mutagenesis, were successful in generating these BnAbs. These results demonstrate that nAb-mediated immune pressure is likely a driving force for positive selection during intra-species transmission of SARS-CoV. Somatic hypermutation (SHM) of a single VL CDR can markedly broaden the activity of a strain-specific nAb. The strategies investigated in this study, in particular the use of structural information in combination of chain-shuffling as well as hot-spot CDR mutagenesis, can be exploited to broaden neutralization activity, to improve anti-viral nAb therapies, and directly manipulate virus evolution.","Sui, Jianhua; Aird, Daniel R.; Tamin, Azaibi; Murakami, Akikazu; Yan, Meiying; Yammanuru, Anuradha; Jing, Huaiqi; Kan, Biao; Liu, Xin; Zhu, Quan; Yuan, Qing-an; Adams, Gregory P.; Bellini, William J.; Xu, Jianguo; Anderson, Larry J.; Marasco, Wayne A.",PLoS Pathog,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1000197; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18989460/,495

The disease has been referred to as COVID-19, and the causative agent has been labelled SARS-CoV-2 due to its genetic similarities to the virus (SARS-CoV-1) responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic nearly 20 years earlier. The spike proteins of both viruses dictate tissue tropism using the angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 (ACE-2) receptor to bind to cells. The ACE-2 receptor can be found in nervous system tissue and endothelial cells among the tissues of many other organs. Neurological complications have been observed with COVID-19. Myalgia and headache are relatively common, but serious neurological disease appears to be rare. No part of the neuraxis is spared. The neurological disorders occurring with COVID-19 may have many pathophysiological underpinnings. Some appear to be the consequence of direct viral invasion of the nervous system tissue, others arise as a postviral autoimmune process, and still others are the result of metabolic and systemic complications due to the associated critical illness. This review addresses the preliminary observations regarding the neurological disorders reported with COVID-19 to date and describes some of the disorders that are anticipated from prior experience with similar coronaviruses.","Berger, Joseph R.",J Neurovirol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32447630/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s13365-020-00840-5,495

The coherence wavelet method and the wavelet-based Granger causality tests applied to US recent daily data unveil the unprecedented impact of COVID-19 and oil price shocks on the geopolitical risk levels, economic policy uncertainty and stock market volatility over the low frequency bands. The effect of the COVID-19 on the geopolitical risk substantially higher than on the US economic uncertainty. The COVID-19 risk is perceived differently over the short and the long-run and may be firstly viewed as an economic crisis.

Many technology and intelligent algorithms have been developed to set the boundary in its incremental growth. This paper proposed a concept to set the boundary on spreading of this disease among the medic people, who are directly exposed to the COVID-19 patient. To reduce their risk to be infected, we have designed the theoretical model of the medic robot to provide medical services to the confirmed case patient. This paper explains the deployment and execution of assigned work of medic robot for patient carrying, delivering food, medications and handling the emergency health services. The medic robots are divided into various group based on their works. The COVID-19 area is considered as a multi-robot environment, where multiple medic robots will work simultaneously. To achieve the multi-robot cooperation and collision avoidance we have implemented the simplest reinforcement learning approach i.e. the Q-learning approach. We have compared the result with respect to the improved-Q-learning approach. A comparative analysis based on parameters like simplicity, objective, deployed robot category and cooperation has been done with some other approaches mentioned in the literature. For simplicity as well as the time and space complexity purpose the results reveal that Q-learning approach is a better consideration. The proposed approach reduces the mortality rate by 2%.","Sahu, Bandita; Das, Pradipta Kumar; Kabat, Manas Ranjan; Kumar, Raghvendra",Qual Quant,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11135-021-01155-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33972809/,495

Further, the rate of growth of infections in India is very close to that in Washington and California. Exponential and classic susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) models based on available data are used to make short and long-term predictions on a daily basis. Based on the SIR model, it is estimated that India will enter equilibrium by the end of May 2020 with the final epidemic size of approximately 13,000. However, this estimation will be invalid if India enters the stage of community transmission. The impact of social distancing, again with the assumption of no community transmission, is also assessed by comparing data from different geographical locations.","Ranjan, Rajesh",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.02.20051466,495

Early detection can improve CRC outcomes, but recent national screening rates (62%) remain below the 80% goal set by the National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable. Multiple options are endorsed for average-risk CRC screening, including the multi-target stool DNA (mt-sDNA) test. We evaluated cross-sectional mt-sDNA test completion in a population of commercially and Medicare-insured patients. METHODS: Participants included individuals ages 50 years and older with commercial insurance or Medicare, with a valid mt-sDNA test shipped by Exact Sciences Laboratories LLC between January 1, 2018, and December 31, 2018 (n = 1,420,460). In 2020, we analyzed cross-sectional adherence, as the percent of successfully completed tests within 365 days of shipment date. RESULTS: Overall cross-sectional adherence was 66.8%. Adherence was 72.1% in participants with Traditional Medicare, 69.1% in participants with Medicare Advantage, and 61.9% in participants with commercial insurance. Adherence increased with age: 60.8% for ages 50–64, 71.3% for ages 65–75, and 74.7% for ages 76 + years. Participants with mt-sDNA tests ordered by gastroenterologists had a higher adherence rate (78.3%) than those with orders by primary care clinicians (67.2%). Geographically, adherence rates were highest among highly rural patients (70.8%) and ordering providers in the Pacific region (71.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Data from this large, national sample of insured patients demonstrate high cross-sectional adherence with the mt-sDNA test, supporting its role as an accepted, noninvasive option for average-risk CRC screening. Attributes of mt-sDNA screening, including home-based convenience and accompanying navigation support, likely contributed to high completion rates.","Miller-Wilson, Lesley-Ann; Rutten, Lila J Finney; Van Thomme, Jack; Ozbay, A Burak; Limburg, Paul J",Int J Colorectal Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34019124/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00384-021-03956-0,495

631602,"Global trend of diabetes mortality attributed to vascular complications, 2000–2016",2020-10-20,"OBJECTIVE: Obesity rates in the United Kingdom are some of the highest in Western Europe, with considerable clinical and societal impacts. Obesity is associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D), osteoarthritis, cardiovascular disease, and increased mortality; however, relatively few studies have examined the occurrence of multiple obesity‐related outcomes in the same patient population. This study was designed to examine the associations between body mass index (BMI) and a broad range of obesity‐related conditions in the same large cohort from a UK‐representative primary care database. METHODS: Demographic data and diagnosis codes were extracted from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD database in January 2019. Adults registered for ≥ 3 years were grouped by BMI, with BMI 18.5–24.9 kg/m(2) as reference group. Associations between BMI and 12 obesity‐related outcomes were estimated using Cox proportional hazard models, adjusted for age, sex, and smoking. RESULTS: More than 2.9 million individuals were included in the analyses and were followed up for occurrence of relevant outcomes for a median of 11.4 years during the study period. Generally, there was a stepwise increase in risk of all outcomes with higher BMI. Individuals with BMI 40.0–45.0 kg/m(2) were at particularly high risk of sleep apnea (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval] vs. reference group: 19.8 [18.9–20.8]), T2D (12.4 [12.1–12.7]), heart failure (3.46 [3.35–3.57]), and hypertension (3.21 [3.15–3.26]). CONCLUSIONS: This study substantiates evidence linking higher BMI to higher risk of a range of serious health conditions, in a large, representative UK cohort. By focusing on obesity‐related conditions, this demonstrates the wider clinical impact and the healthcare burden of obesity, and highlights the vital importance of management, treatment approaches, and public health programs to mitigate the impact of this disease.","Haase, Christiane L.; Eriksen, Kirsten T.; Lopes, Sandra; Satylganova, Altynai; Schnecke, Volker; McEwan, Phil",Obes Sci Pract,https://doi.org/10.1002/osp4.474; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33841883/,495

This study analyzes hospitalization rates for 37 emergency-sensitive conditions in the largest German-wide hospital network during different pandemic phases. Methods: Using claims data of 80 hospitals, consecutive cases between January 1 and November 17, 2020 were analyzed and compared to a corresponding period in 2019. Incidence-rate ratios (IRR) comparing the both periods were calculated using Poisson regression to model the number of hospitalizations per day. Results: There was a hospitalization deficit between March 12 and June 13, 2020 (coinciding with the 1st pandemic wave) with 32,807 hospitalizations as opposed to 39,379 in 2019 (IRR 0.83, 95% CI 0.82-0.85, P<0.01). During the following period (June 14 to November 17, 2020, including the start of 2nd wave), hospitalizations were reduced from 63,799 in 2019 to 59,910 in 2020, but this reduction was not that pronounced (IRR 0.94, 95% CI 0.93-0.95, P<0.01). There was an increase in hospitalizations for acute myocardial infarction, aortic aneurism/dissection and pulmonary embolism after the 1st wave during which hospitalizations had been reduced for those conditions. In contrast, hospitalizations for sepsis, pneumonia, obstructive pulmonary disease, and intracranial injuries were reduced during the entire pandemic. Conclusions: There was an overall reduction of hospitalizations for emergency-sensitive conditions in Germany during the Covid-19 pandemic with heterogeneous effects on different disease categories. The increase of hospitalizations for acute myocardial infarction, aortic aneurism/dissection and pulmonary embolism is an alarming signal that requires attention and further studies.","BOLLMANN, A.; Hohenstein, S.; Pellissier, V.; Koenig, S.; Ueberham, L.; Hindricks, G.; Meier-Hellmann, A.; Kuhlen, R.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.21250309v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.08.21250309,495

We conducted this survey to document the number of surgeries performed on COVID-19-positive patients during the ongoing pandemic at a tertiary care center in Pakistan. Materials and methods A retrospective clinical audit was conducted in a tertiary care hospital that receives surgical cases from almost all over the country. Ethical approval was granted prior to the execution of this intra-departmental audit. Both patients who were admitted to general surgery and visited on a consultative basis in other departments during the year 2020 were evaluated, and only those having COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive were included. Those with PCR-negative were omitted from the analysis. All the surgical procedures performed in these patients, along with those managed conservatively, were analyzed. Basic and demographic data of all patients were collected from electronic medical records. The data were defined as either mean and standard deviation or frequency and relative percentages. The normality of the data was verified by the Shapiro-Wilk test. Parametric analysis was used to interpret the disparity in descriptive statistics. Although the categorical results were compared by cross-tabulation, the degrees of significance were calculated either by chi-square test or Fisher's exact test according to the distribution of the data. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant (two-tailed). Results A total of 79 COVID-19-positive patients were provided with surgical services and subsequently analyzed. The mean age of those patients was 48.88 ± 16.62 years. The mean length of stay in the hospital was 2.10 ± 3.52 with indifference among gender and mode of treatment (either surgical or conservative). The study participants were 59.5% males and 40.5% females, and only 6.3% had a past surgical history. Most patients were admitted through the outpatient department (65.8%), and only a few were referrals from other departments (10.1%); 64.5% of patients were managed in general wards, 24.0% in critical care units, and 11.4% in intensive care units. Surgical intervention was done in 60.8% of the COVID-19-positive patients, while the rest 39.2% were conservatively managed. Among whom, 63.3% were discharged, 29.1% of them left against medical advice (LAMA), with a 7.6% death rate during the hospital stay. The frequent comorbidities were diabetes (27.8%) and hypertension (26.6%), although most patients had no comorbidities (49.3%). Symptomatic gall stones were the most frequent reason for surgical admission in COVID-19-positive patients, while the most frequent surgical intervention performed was laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Males were comparatively managed more frequently by surgical intervention and females been more conservatively managed (p = 0.037). Out of the six mortalities, five were surgically managed. Seventy seven percent of the surgically managed patients were discharged, and the majority of LAMA patients were being conservatively managed (p < 0.001).

634742,COVID 19 and the Patient with Obesity – The Editors Speak Out,2020-04-01,"SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants are emerging around the globe. Unfortunately, several SARS-CoV-2 variants, especially variants of concern (VOCs), are less susceptible to neutralization by the convalescent and post-vaccination sera, raising concerns of increased disease transmissibility and severity. Recent data suggests that SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody levels are a reliable correlate of vaccine-mediated protection. However, currently used BSL3-based virus micro-neutralization (MN) assays are more laborious, time-consuming, and expensive, underscoring the need for BSL2-based, cost-effective neutralization assays against SARS-CoV-2 variants. In light of this unmet need, we have developed a BSL-2 pseudovirus-based neutralization assay (PBNA) in cells expressing the human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (hACE2) receptor for SARS-CoV-2. The assay is reproducible (R(2) = 0.96), demonstrates a good dynamic range and high sensitivity. Our data suggest that the biological Anti-SARS-CoV-2 research reagents such as NIBSC 20/130 show lower neutralization against B.1.351 SA (South Africa) and B.1.1.7 UK (United Kingdom) VOC, whereas a commercially available monoclonal antibody MM43 retains activity against both these variants. SARS-CoV-2 spike PBNAs for VOCs would be useful tools to measure the neutralization ability of candidate vaccines in both preclinical models and clinical trials and would further help develop effective prophylactic countermeasures against emerging neutralization escape phenotypes.","Kalkeri, Raj; Cai, Zhaohui; Lin, Shuling; Farmer, John; Kuzmichev, Yury V.; Koide, Fusataka",Microorganisms,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34442823/; https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms9081744,495

METHODS: We retrospectively matched (1:2) critical COVID-19 patients with one or more MDR GNB from any clinical specimen (cases), with those with no MDR GNB isolates (controls). RESULTS: Seventy-eight cases were identified (4.5 per 1,000 ICU days, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.6–5.7). Out of 98 MDR GNB isolates, the most frequent species were Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (24, 24.5%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (23, 23.5%). Two (8.7%) K. pneumoniae, and six (85.7%) Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were carbapenem resistant. A total of 24 (24.5%) isolates were not considered to be associated with active infection. Those with active infection received appropriate antimicrobial agent within a median of one day. The case group had significantly longer median central venous line days, mechanical ventilation days, and hospital length of stay (P<0.001 for each). All-cause mortality at 28 days was not significantly different between the two groups (P = 0.19). Mechanical ventilation days (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.062, 95% CI 1.012 to 1.114; P 0.015), but not receipt of corticosteroids or tocilizumab, was independently associated with the isolation of MDR GNB. There was no association between MDR GNB and 28-day all-cause mortality (aOR 2.426, 95% CI 0.833 to 7.069; P = 0.104). CONCLUSION: In critically ill COVID-19 patients, prevention of MDR GNB colonization and infections requires minimising the use of invasive devices, and to remove them as soon as their presence is no longer necessary.","Baiou, Anas; Elbuzidi, Abdurrahman A.; Bakdach, Dana; Zaqout, Ahmed; Alarbi, Khalid M.; Bintaher, Awadh A.; Ali, Maisa M.B.; Elarabi, Anam M.; Ali, Gawahir A.M.; Daghfal, Joanne; Almaslamani, Muna A.; Ibrahim, Abdul Salam S.; Alkhal, Abdullatif; Omrani, Ali S.",J Hosp Infect,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0195670121000475; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33561503/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670121000475?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2021.01.027,495

The internet is a frequently used resource for providing patient education materials (PEMs). The aim of this study was to evaluate the readability, content, and quality of web-based PEMs on COVID-19 from US academic medical centers. METHODS: The names of US medical schools were obtained from the Association of American Medical Colleges website (n = 145). Institutional, hospital, and heath encyclopedia websites associated with each schools’ medical center were identified using Google. Readability of COVID-19 PEMs was calculated using three validated indices: (1) Flesh-Kincaid Grade Level, (2) Simple Measure of Gobbledygook, and (3) Gunning Frequency of Gobbledygook. Content was evaluated using a scoring matrix based on materials available on the Center for Disease Control website. The Patient Education Material Assessment Tool for Print (PEMAT-P) was used to assess usability and actionability. RESULTS: A total of 141 (97%) PEMs met inclusion criteria and were analyzed for readability, content, and quality. The mean readability was above the recommended sixth grade reading level (P < .001). Content was variable across PEMs. The PEMAT-P scores reflected good understandability with a median score of 83% (IQR 75%-87%), while actionability was poor with a median score of 41% (IQR 40%-60%). CONCLUSIONS: Despite availability of web-based PEMs for COVID-19, the readability was significantly higher than the National Institute of Health and US Department of Health and Human Services recommended sixth grade reading level and actionability of PEMs was low. It is critical to provide readable PEMs on COVID-19 to effectively disseminate accurate information and facilitate patients’ understanding of the virus, how it spreads, and how to protect themselves.","Kruse, Jessica; Toledo, Paloma; Belton, Tayler B.; Testani, Erica J.; Evans, Charlesnika T.; Grobman, William A.; Miller, Emily S.; Lange, Elizabeth M.S.",Am J Infect Control,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2020.11.023; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655320310312?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33259825/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655320310312,495

METHODS: In 2019 we completed a mixed-methods study in two provinces of Vanuatu, (SANMA and TORBA). The study comprised 1) a population-based disability survey using the Washington Group Short-Set 2) a nested case-control study to explore associations between WASH, disability and gender, and 3) an in-depth qualitative assessment of the experiences of WASH users with additional requirements: people with and without disabilities who menstruate, or experience incontinence. FINDING: 11,446 households (response rate 85%) were enrolled into the survey. All-age disability prevalence across the two provinces was 2.6% (95% Confidence Interval 2.5–2.8), increasing with age. 814 people with, and 702 people without disabilities participated in the case-control study. People with disabilities were statistically more likely to experience barriers in seven of eight intra-household indicators. WASH-related stigma, reliance on informal caregivers, and under-resourcing of WASH personnel were critical issues for people who menstruate or experience incontinence. INTERPRETATION: People with disabilities, people with incontinence and people who menstruate in Northern Vanuatu face continued challenges in accessing safe, affordable and appropriate WASH that meets their requirements. Outputs from this study have supported progression towards gender and disability-inclusive WASH programming in the area and highlighted the value of mixed-methods research.

637710,684 Contribution of Pulmonary Diseases to COVID-19 Mortality in a Diverse Community of New York City,2021-05-03,"The first case of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Italy was detected on February the 20(th) in Lombardy region. Since that date, Lombardy has been the most affected Italian region by the epidemic, and its healthcare system underwent a severe overload during the outbreak. From a public health point of view, therefore, it is fundamental to provide healthcare services with tools that can reveal possible new health system stress periods with a certain time anticipation, which is the main aim of the present study. Moreover, the sequence of law decrees to face the epidemic and the large amount of news generated in the population feelings of anxiety and suspicion. Considering this whole complex context, it is easily understandable how people “overcrowded” social media with messages dealing with the pandemic, and emergency numbers were overwhelmed by the calls. Thus, in order to find potential predictors of possible new health system overloads, we analysed data both from Twitter and emergency services comparing them to the daily infected time series at a regional level. Particularly, we performed a wavelet analysis in the time-frequency plane, to finely discriminate over time the anticipation capability of the considered potential predictors. In addition, a cross-correlation analysis has been performed to find a synthetic indicator of the time delay between the predictor and the infected time series. Our results show that Twitter data are more related to social and political dynamics, while the emergency calls trends can be further evaluated as a powerful tool to potentially forecast new stress periods. Since we analysed aggregated regional data, and taking into account also the huge geographical heterogeneity of the epidemic spread, a future perspective would be to conduct the same analysis on a more local basis.","Rivieccio, Bruno Alessandro; Micheletti, Alessandra; Maffeo, Manuel; Zignani, Matteo; Comunian, Alessandro; Nicolussi, Federica; Salini, Silvia; Manzi, Giancarlo; Auxilia, Francesco; Giudici, Mauro; Naldi, Giovanni; Gaito, Sabrina; Castaldi, Silvana; Biganzoli, Elia",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0247854; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33630966/,495

It is an attractive approach to find new uses for old drugs as they have already been through extensive clinical testing and could easily be accelerated for clinical approval. Briefly, we performed virtual screening of a database of small molecules against SARS 3CLpro, analyzed inhibitor–protease complexes, and identified several covalent and non-covalent inhibitors. Several old drugs that bind to SARS 3CLpro active site were selected and in silico derivatized to generate covalent irreversible inhibitors with enhanced affinity. Furthermore, we show that pharmacophores derived from clusters of compounds resulting out of virtual screening could be useful probes for future structure–activity relationship studies (SARs) and fine-tune the lead molecules identified.","Rajnarayanan, Rajendram V.; Dakshanamurthy, Sivanesan; Pattabiraman, Nagarajan",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X04014433; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15358186/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X04014433,495

638774,The challenges and risk of laboratory handling on a histology specimen during COVID-19 pandemic,2021-03-26,"Adenoviruses are large (~950 Å) and complex non-enveloped, dsDNA icosahedral viruses. They have a pseudo-T = 25 triangulation number with at least 12 different proteins composing the virion. These include the major and minor capsid proteins, core proteins, maturation protease, terminal protein, and packaging machinery. Although adenoviruses have been studied for more than 60 years, deciphering their architecture has presented a challenge for structural biology techniques. An outstanding event was the first near-atomic resolution structure of human adenovirus type 5 (HAdV-C5), solved by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) in 2010. Discovery of new adenovirus types, together with methodological advances in structural biology techniques, in particular cryo-EM, has lately produced a considerable amount of new, high-resolution data on the organization of adenoviruses belonging to different species. In spite of these advances, the organization of the non-icosahedral core is still a great unknown. Nevertheless, alternative techniques such as atomic force microscopy (AFM) are providing interesting glimpses on the role of the core proteins in genome condensation and virion stability. Here we summarize the current knowledge on adenovirus structure, with an emphasis on high-resolution structures obtained since 2010.","Gallardo, José; Pérez-Illana, Marta; Martín-González, Natalia; San Martín, Carmen",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34063479/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22105240,495

A lack of clinically germane research has led to equivocal, and occasionally conflicting, healthcare respiratory protection recommendations from public health organizations, professional societies, and experts. METHODS: The Respiratory Protection Effectiveness Clinical Trial (ResPECT) is a prospective comparison of respiratory protective equipment to be conducted at multiple U.S. study sites. Healthcare personnel who work in outpatient settings will be cluster-randomized to wear N95 respirators or medical masks for protection against infections during respiratory virus season. Outcome measures will include laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory infections, acute respiratory illness, and influenza-like illness. Participant exposures to patients, coworkers, and others with symptoms and signs of respiratory infection, both within and beyond the workplace, will be recorded in daily diaries. Adherence to study protocols will be monitored by the study team. DISCUSSION: ResPECT is designed to better understand the extent to which N95s and MMs reduce clinical illness among healthcare personnel.

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted on 422 indigenous people aged between 16 and 90 using the 21-item Bangla Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (BDASS-21) and the Bangla version of the WHO-5 Well-being Index from January 30 to April 10, 2021. Data were collected by trained research assistants from three remote hilly areas namely Bandarban, Rangamati, and Khagracchari in the Chattogram Hill Tracts (CHT). Chi-squares, logistic regression, and ANOVA were performed to examine the association of variables. RESULTS: The prevalence of moderate to extremely severe depression, anxiety, stress, and low well-being among the indigenous population during the pandemic was found to be 49.3%, 47.2%, 36.7%, and 50.9%, respectively. Risk predictors for depression, anxiety, and stress included age, ethnicity, geographical locations, educational attainment, occupation, and marital status. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the ongoing pandemic has led to the rise of common mental health problems among indigenous people during the pandemic. The results can contribute to the formation of mental health policy for indigenous people and the development of suitable mental health intervention strategies especially during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Faruk, Md.

There is an urgent need to develop an effective vaccine to reduce its pandemic potential. In the present study, we evaluated the biochemical characteristics and immunogenicity of two H7 virus-like particles (VLPs) composed of the matrix 1 (M1) and hemagglutinin of wild-type (HA-WT) or hemagglutinin of whose transmembrane domain replaced by that from H3N2 subtype (HA-TM). H7 VLPs-WT and H7 VLPs-TM could assemble and release into the supernatant of Sf9 cells and they had similar morphological characteristics. However, compared to H7 VLPs-WT, H7 VLPs-TM had more trimeric HA proteins and could better resist thermal changes. In mice H7 VLPs-TM induced higher titers of HI, IgG, IgG2a and IFN-γ, and provided better protection against homologous and heterologous H7N9 viruses (no matter belonging to Yangtze River Delta or Pearl River Delta) challenge with less weight loss and higher survival rate. In summary, H7 VLPs-TM represents a potential strategy for the development of H7N9 vaccines.","Qin, Jianru; Zhang, Yun; Shen, Xiaoting; Gong, Lang; Peng, Ouyang; Liu, Yuan; Xue, Chunyi; Cao, Yongchang",Vaccine,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X18309344; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X18309344; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.07.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30037418/,495

While today more women in low- and middle-income countries give birth in health care facilities, reductions in maternal and neonatal mortality have been less than expected. This paradox may be explained by the standard and quality of intrapartum care provision which depends on several factors such as health workforce capacity and the readiness of the health system as well as access to care. METHODS: Using an explanatory sequential mixed method design we will employ three methods (i) a survey will be conducted using self-administered questionnaires assessing knowledge, (ii) skills drills assessing basic intrapartum skills and attitudes, using an observation checklist and (iii) Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) to explore midwifery care providers’ experiences and perceptions of in-service training. All midwifery care providers in the study facilities are eligible to participate in the study. For the skills drills a stratified sample of midwifery care providers will be selected in each hospital according to the number of providers and, professional titles and purposive sampling will be used for the FGDs. Descriptive summary statistics from the survey and skills drills will be presented by country. Conventional content analysis will be employed for data analysis of the FGDs. DISCUSSION: We envision comparative insight across hospitals and countries. The findings will be used to inform a targeted quality in-service training and quality improvement intervention related to provision of basic intrapartum care as part of the ALERT project.

The causative agent of this disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus which also includes severe acute respiratory syndrome related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome related coronavirus (MERSr-CoV). Codon usage of viral genes are believed to be subjected to different selection pressures in different host environments. Previous studies on codon usage of influenza A viruses can help identify viral host origins and evolution trends, however, similar studies on coronaviruses are lacking. In this study, global correspondence analysis (CA), within-group correspondence analysis (WCA) and between-group correspondence analysis (BCA) were performed among different genes in coronavirus viral sequences. The amino acid usage pattern of SARS-CoV-2 was generally found similar to bat and human SARSr-CoVs. However, we found greater synonymous codon usage differences between SARS-CoV-2 and its phylogenetic relatives on spike and membrane genes, suggesting these two genes of SARS-CoV-2 are subjected to different evolutionary pressures.","Gu, Haogao; Chu, Daniel; Peiris, Malik; Poon, Leo L.M.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.15.950568,495

It was demonstrated that there is a high and significantly positive linear correlation between troponin T and plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels, biomarkers of cardiac injury and systemic inflammation, respectively. Cardiac injury and inflammation is a relatively common association among patients hospitalized with COVID-19, and it is related to higher risk of in-hospital mortality. In our literature search, we identified several potential mechanisms of myocardial tissue damage, namely, coronavirus-associated acute myocarditis, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor binding affinity to the virus Spike protein, increased cytokine secretion, and hypoxia-induced cardiac myocyte apoptosis. Elucidation of the disease pathogenesis and prospective histopathological studies are crucial for future proper treatment in case of renewed outbreaks. Of interest is that with hundred of thousands of bodies available for autopsy studies, no prospective investigation has been reported so far. Strong efforts and continued research of the cardiovascular complications and identification of risk factors for poor prognosis in COVID-19 are steadily needed. The high morbidity and mortality of COVID-19, its monumental economic burden and social impact, the despair of a new pandemic outbreak, and the thread of potential utilization of novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 as biologic weapons make it a preponderant necessity to better comprehend the therapeutic management of this lethal disease. Emerging as an acute infectious disease, COVID-19 may become a chronic epidemic because of genetic recombination. Therefore, we should be ready for the reemergence of COVID-19 or other coronaviruses.","Centurión, Osmar Antonio; Scavenius, Karina E.; García, Laura B.; Torales, Judith M.; Miño, Luís M.",Crit Pathw Cardiol,https://doi.org/10.1097/hpc.0000000000000227; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32467423/,495

647235,Collateral damage of the COVID-19 outbreak: expression of concern,2020-05-04,"BACKGROUND: Between February and April 2020, Italy experienced an overwhelming growth of the COVID-19 pandemic. Little is known, at the country level, where and how patients on renal replacement therapy (RRT) have been mostly affected. METHODS: Survey of the network of Nephrology centers using a simplified 17 items electronic questionnaire designed by Italian Society of Nephrology COVID-19 Research Group. We used spatial epidemiology and geographical information systems to map SARS-CoV-2 spread among RRT patients in Italy. RESULTS: On April 9th 2020, all nephrology centers (n = 454) listed in the DialMap database were invited to complete the electronic questionnaire. Within 11 days on average, 365 centers responded (80.4% response rate; 2.3% margin of error) totaling 60,441 RRT patients. The surveyed RRT population included 30,821 hemodialysis (HD), 4139 peritoneal dialysis (PD), and 25,481 transplanted (Tx) patients respectively. The proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive RRT patients in Italy was 2.26% (95% CI 2.14–2.39) with significant differences according to treatment modality (p < 0.001). The proportion of patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 was significantly higher in HD (3.55% [95% CI 3.34–3.76]) than PD (1.38% [95% CI 1.04–1.78] and Tx (0.86% [95% CI 0.75–0.98]) (p < 0.001), with substantial heterogeneity across regions and along the latitude gradient (p < 0.001). In RRT patients the highest rate was in the north-west (4.39% [95% CI 4.11–4.68], followed by the north-east (IR 2.06% [1.79–2.36]), the center (0.91% [0.75–1.09]), the main islands (0.67% [0.47–0.93]), and the south (0.59% [0.45–0.75]. During the COVID-19 pandemic, among SARS-Cov-2 positive RRT patients the fatality rate was 32.8%, as compared to 13.3% observed in the Italian population as of April 23rd. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of the 60,441 surveyed RRT patients in Italy were SARS-Cov-2 positive and subsequently died during the exponential phase of COVID-19 pandemic.

648265,Editorial: Fifty Campbell systematic reviews relevant to the policy response to COVID‐19,2020-08-10,"INTRODUCTION: Most research on loneliness comes from the health sciences, statistically seeking to measure the health-related effects of feeling alone or isolated. There is a need to expand on this understanding and explore loneliness as a more complex social phenomenon. In this article, we present a qualitative design for studying the intersection between loneliness, technology and culture. Conceptualising this as the cultural dialectic between loneliness and technology, we aim to unpack the reciprocal ways by which understandings of loneliness shape technology, while technologies also affect society’s understandings of loneliness. In elucidating this dialectic, we aim to develop new knowledge and a novel theoretical framework for understanding loneliness and its technological solutions, which, in turn, can enable better solutions to contemporary problems of loneliness. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will adopt a qualitative approach that combines interviews, participant observation and textual analysis to explore loneliness and its technological solutions from the perspectives of policy-makers, producers, professionals and users in Norway and the UK. The data will be analysed through an analytical framework combining insights from discourse theory and philosophical debates on presence, which will allow us to capture and rethink fundamental assumptions about loneliness and technology. Outcomes will be revised understandings of loneliness, relevant to researchers, entrepreneurs, policy-makers, clinicians, educators and the broader public.

This study was conducted to validate the factor structure of the Greek version of DEPS-R using Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), to investigate its reliability and convergent validity in Greek T1DM adults and to compare a single factor DEPS-R model with multiple factor models. Participants were 103 T1DM adults receiving insulin, who responded to DEPS-R. Their anthropometric, biochemical and clinical history data were evaluated. The sample presented good glycemic control and 30.1% scored above the established DEPS-R cut-off score for disturbed eating behavior. CFA results revealed that the data fit well to the factor models. The DEPS-R scale had good reliability and was positively linked to BMI, HbA1c, total daily dose and time in range. Model comparison supported the superiority of the 1-factor model, implying that Greek clinicians and practitioners might not have to consider individualized treatment based on various scores across different subscales but they can adopt a single DEPS-R score for an easy and efficient screening for disordered eating.","Karastogiannidou, Calliope; Giannoulaki, Parthena; Samaras, Ioannis; Kotzakioulafi, Evangelia; Didangelos, Triantafyllos; Bocsan, Ioana Corina; Vassilopoulou, Emilia",Nutrients,https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13072375; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34371885/,495
649366,Impact of the smell loss on the quality of life and adopted coping strategies in COVID-19 patients,2021-01-19,"With increasing knowledge of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), we now understand that COVID-19 presents with various extrapulmonary manifestations with multi-organ involvement. Involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) occurs probably via transsynaptic spread or transfer across the blood–brain barrier. Hypoxia, immune-mediated injury, and vascular damage are the potential mechanisms for the CNS manifestations. Headache, dizziness, chemosensory disturbances, such as loss of smell, taste, encephalopathy, stroke, etc., are among the commonly encountered neurological presentations. Headache is identified as one of the red flag symptoms for COVID-19. Sudden onset of loss of smell and/or taste in the absence of nasal congestion can help in COVID-19 case identification and testing prioritization. Both hemorrhagic and ischemic brain injury is common in patients developing stroke. Besides these, COVID-19-associated CNS involvement demands more careful attention toward patients with existing neurological disorders especially that are managed with immunosuppressant agents. In all, neurological involvement in COVID-19 is not uncommon and may precede, occur concomitantly or after the respiratory involvement. It may also be the sole presentation in some of the patients necessitating high vigilance for COVID-19. In this review, we briefly discussed the pathogenesis of CNS involvement and some important neurological manifestations in COVID-19.

Systematic appraisal of senior surgeons’ consensus can be used to generate interim recommendations until data from clinical observations will become available. Hence, we aimed to collect and quantitatively appraise nationwide UK consultants’ opinion on clinical decision making for patients requiring cardiac surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We mailed a web-based questionnaire to all consultant cardiac surgeons through the Society for Cardiothoracic Surgery in Great Britain and Ireland (SCTS) mailing list on the 17th April 2020 and we pre-determined to close the survey on the 21st April 2020. This survey was primarily designed to gather information on UK surgeons’ opinion using 12 items. Strong consensus was predefined as an opinion shared by at least 60% of responding consultants. Results A total of 86 consultant surgeons undertook the survey. All UK cardiac units were represented by at least one consultant. Strong consensus was achieved for the following key questions:1) before any hospital admission for cardiac surgery, nasopharyngeal swab, r-PCR and chest CT should be performed; 2) the use of full PPE should to be adopted in every case by the theatre team regardless patient’s COVID-19 status; 3) the risk of COVID-19 exposure for patients undergoing heart surgery should be considered moderate to high and likely to increase mortality if it occurs; 4) cardiac procedure should be decided based on a rapidly convened multidisciplinary team discussion for every patient. The majority believed that both aortic and mitral surgery should be considered in selected cases. The role of coronary artery bypass graft surgery during the pandemic was controversial. Conclusions In this unprecedented pandemic period, this survey provides information for generating interim recommendations until data from clinical observations will become available.","Benedetto, Umberto; Goodwin, Andrew; Kendall, Simon; Uppal, Rakesh; Akowuah, Enoch",J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022522320311673?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32505456/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcvs.2020.05.016; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022522320311673,495
649476,BRD2 regulation of sigma-2 receptor upon cholesterol deprivation,2020-11-24,"In the struggle with COVID-19, art offered a way to face the solitude of the lockdown. The focus of this paper is primarily on Caravaggio's painting The Seven Works of Mercy, with references to other paintings to amplify some aspects of the artist's approach to life and his uniqueness in the artistic landscape of his time. Darkness was part of Caravaggio's research for spiritual truth and by entering the stories of his life and exploring the tales told through imaginative expression in his paintings, it is possible to understand his process of exploration of ancestral darkness. The author uses her imagination to reflect on how art can help to contact the profound fears buried in the unconscious which are now being awakened by the pandemic. The contemplation of this painting facilitated the emergence of emotions related to the darkness of our time, with the discovery that empathy and mercy offer a way to come to terms with the pandemic. This approach demands a different understanding of reality with Caravaggio's dark creative world becoming a companion that permits the exploration of what is not yet thinkable in daily life. Images accompany the author's research that relies on her imagination and amplifications.","Vezzoli, Caterina",J Anal Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34231888/; https://doi.org/10.1111/1468-5922.12694,495
649979,Discovering common pathogenetic processes between COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus by differential gene expression pattern analysis,2021-07-17,"INTRODUCTION: A few major clinical factors such as sex, obesity or comorbidities have already been associated with COVID-19 severity, but there is a need to identify new epidemiological, clinical, digital and biological characteristics associated with severity and perform deep phenotyping of patients according to severity. The objectives of the Predi-COVID study are (1) to identify new determinants of COVID-19 severity and (2) to conduct deep phenotyping of patients by stratifying them according to risk of complications, as well as risk factors for infection among household members of Predi-COVID participants (the Predi-COVID-H ancillary study). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Predi-COVID is a prospective, hybrid cohort study composed of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases in Luxembourg who will be followed up remotely for 1 year to monitor their health status and symptoms. Predi-COVID-H is an ancillary cohort study on household members of index cases included in Predi-COVID to monitor symptoms and household clusters in this high-risk population. A subcohort of up to 200 Predi-COVID and 300 Predi-COVID-H participants with biological samples will be included. Severity of infection will be evaluated by occurrence and duration of hospitalisation, admission and duration of stay in intensive care units or equivalent structures, provision of and duration of supplemental oxygen and ventilation therapy, transfer to another hospital, as well as the impact of infection on daily activities following hospital discharge. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been approved by the National Research Ethics Committee of Luxembourg (study number 202003/07) in April 2020. An informed consent is signed by study participants. Scientific articles will be submitted to international peer-reviewed journals, along with press releases for lay audience for major results.

Injury incidence and percent proportion was calculated for the 2020 elite senior men's domestic cricket season and compared to a historical average from five previous regular seasons (2015 to 2019 inclusive). The injury profile for the shortened 2020 season was generally equivalent to what would be expected in a regular season, except for a significant increase in medical illness as a proportion of time loss (17% compared to historic average of 6%) and in-season days lost (9% compared to historic average of 3%) due to COVID-19 related instances (most notably precautionary isolation due to contact with a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 case). There was a significant increase in the proportion of in-season days lost to thigh injuries (24% compared to 9%) and a significant decrease in the proportion of days lost to hand (4% compared to 12%) and lumbar spine (7% compared to 21%) injuries. These findings enhance understanding of the impact prolonged period of training disruption and shortened season can have on cricket injuries and the challenges faced by practitioners under such circumstances.","Goggins, Luke; Peirce, Nicholas; Griffin, Steve; Langley, Ben; Jowitt, Hannah; McKay, Carly; Stokes, Keith A; Williams, Sean",Int. j. sports med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34555858/; https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1652-5352,495

The Precision Recovery Program (PRP) remotely monitored and supported patients with COVID-19 in their home environment. Methods: This was a single-center retrospective cohort study reviewing data acquired from the PRP clinical initiative. Results: Of the 679 patients enrolled in the PRP, 156 patients were screened by a clinician following a deterioration in symptoms and vital signs on a total of 240 occasions, and included in the analyses. Of these 240 occasions, 162 (67%) were escalated to the PRP physician. Thirty-six patients were referred to emergency department, with 12 (7%) admitted to the hospital. The most common risk factors coinciding with hospital admissions were cardiac (67%), age >65 (42%), obesity (25%), and pulmonary (17%). The most common symptoms reported that triggered a screening event were dyspnea/tachypnea (27%), chest pain (14%), and gastrointestinal issues (8%). Vital signs that commonly triggered a screening event were pulse oximetry (15%), heart rate (11%), and temperature (9%). Discussion: Common factors (risk factors, vital signs, and symptoms) among patients requiring screening, triage, and hospitalization were identified, providing clinicians with further information to support decision making when utilizing RPM in this cohort. Conclusion: A clinician-led RPM program for patients with acute COVID-19 infection provided supportive care and screening for deterioration. Similar models should be considered for implementation in COVID-19 cohorts and other conditions at risk of rapid clinical deterioration in the home setting.","Tabacof, Laura; Wood, Jamie; Mohammadi, Nicki; Link, Katherine E; Tosto-Mancuso, Jenna; Dewil, Sophie; Breyman, Erica; Nasr, Leila; Kellner, Christopher; Putrino, David",Telemed. j. e. health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34292768/; https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2021.0101,495

651349,Delays in surgery for cholesteatoma due to COVID-19: is there an impact on rates of recidivism and major complications?,2020-10-10,"SARS-CoV-2 is a newly emerged coronavirus that causes a respiratory disease with variable severity and fatal consequences. It was first reported in Wuhan and subsequently caused a global pandemic. The viral spike protein binds with the ACE-2 cell surface receptor for entry, while TMPRSS2 triggers its membrane fusion. In addition, RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), 3′–5′ exoribonuclease (nsp14), viral proteases, N, and M proteins are important in different stages of viral replication. Accordingly, they are attractive targets for different antiviral therapeutic agents. Although many antiviral agents have been used in different clinical trials and included in different treatment protocols, the mode of action against SARS-CoV-2 is still not fully understood. Different potential repurposed drugs, including, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, remdesivir, and favipiravir, were screened in the present study. Molecular docking of these drugs with different SARS-CoV-2 target proteins, including spike and membrane proteins, RdRp, nucleoproteins, viral proteases, and nsp14, was performed. Moreover, the binding affinities of the human ACE-2 receptor and TMPRSS2 to the different drugs were evaluated. Molecular dynamics simulation and MM-PBSA calculation were also conducted. Ivermectin and remdesivir were found to be the most promising drugs. Our results suggest that both these drugs utilize different mechanisms at the entry and post-entry stages and could be considered potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 replication.","Eweas, Ahmad F.; Alhossary, Amr A.; Abdel-Moneim, Ahmed S.",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33746908/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2020.592908,495

We evaluate this issue by including all consecutive allo-HCT recipients with molecularly-documented CARV infection during the first year after transplant. The study cohort was drawn from a prospective longitudinal survey of CARV in allo-HCT recipient having respiratory symptoms conducted from December 2013 to December 2018 at two Spanish transplant centers. Respiratory viruses in upper and/or lower respiratory specimens were tested using multiplex PCR panel assays. The study cohort comprised 233 allo-HCT recipients with 376 CARV infection episodes diagnosed during the first year after allo-HCT. Overall, 60% of CARV episodes occurred within the first 6 months (227 out of 376). Thirty patients (13%) had died at 3 months after CARV detection, of which 25 (83%) were recipients developing CARV within the first 6 months after transplant. Multivariate analysis identified four risk factors for mortality: ATG used as part of conditioning regimen [odds ratio (OR) 2.8, 95% confidence interval (C.I.) 1.21–6.4, p = 0.01], CARV lower respiratory tract disease (OR 3.4, 95% C.I. 1.4–8.4, p = 0.007), CARV infection within the first 6 months of transplant (OR 3.04, 95% C.I. 1.1–8.7, p = 0.03), and absolute lymphocyte count <0.2 × 109/L (OR 2.4, 95% C.I. 1–5.3, p = 0.04).

Los riesgos y los agentes patógenos responsables son diferentes en función del tipo de población (prematuros, recién nacidos, otros). Además, esta población, que comparte los mismos factores de riesgo de infecciones nosocomiales que la población adulta (hospitalización en reanimación, cateterismos, etc.), se distingue no sólo por la inmadurez del sistema inmunitario de los recién nacidos, sino también por la multiplicidad de los participantes, desde los sanitarios hasta los padres, pasando por los educadores y los acompañantes (visitantes de todo tipo, etc.) necesarios para el desarrollo conductual y emocional del niño. Además, es importante subrayar el aumento del riesgo ligado a los contactos frecuentes, cercanos e íntimos que están parcial e incluso totalmente ausentes en el ámbito hospitalario «adulto». Así como existen riesgos de transmisión cruzada a través del principal vector constituido por los sanitarios, el control del riesgo no puede excluir a los educadores, a los acompañantes, a los padres y a los mismos niños. Si el riesgo en la esfera adulta está limitado a las actividades médicas, en la esfera pediátrica se comparte con las demás actividades (juegos, enseñanza, etc.), que con frecuencia son comunes. Todos estos riesgos son todavía mayores debido a la prevalencia de los agentes patógenos como los virus (respiratorios y digestivos), la frecuencia de las antibioticoterapias y la dificultad de los diagnósticos etiológicos, dada la inespecificidad de los signos clínicos y la actitud diagnóstica poco o nada invasiva. De esta manera, el control del riesgo infeccioso nosocomial se resume en los siguientes elementos: un reservorio importante y difícilmente identificable, numerosos vectores potenciales, una población expuesta de manera variable al riesgo, todo ello sin olvidar las necesidades emocionales de los niños y los comportamientos «culturales».","Burgard, M.; Grall, I.; Descamps, P.; Zahar, J.-R.",EMC Pediatr,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1245178913645060; https://doi.org/10.1016/s1245-1789(13)64506-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288515/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1245178913645060,495

Challenges in testing can be traced to an initial shortage of supplies, expertise, and/or instrumentation necessary to detect the virus by quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR), the most robust, sensitive, and specific assay currently available. Here we show that academic biochemistry and molecular biology laboratories equipped with appropriate expertise and infrastructure can replicate commercially available SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR test kits and backfill pipeline shortages. The Georgia Tech COVID-19 Test Kit Support Group, composed of faculty, staff, and trainees across the biotechnology quad at Georgia Institute of Technology, synthesized multiplexed primers and probes and formulated a master mix composed of enzymes and proteins produced in-house. Our in-house kit compares favorably with a commercial product used for diagnostic testing. We also developed an environmental testing protocol to readily monitor surfaces for the presence of SARS-CoV-2.

652707,The prevalence of common and stress-related mental health disorders in healthcare workers based in pandemic-affected hospitals: a rapid systematic review and meta-analysis,2020-10-16,"PURPOSE: Preliminary reports suggest that critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection requiring mechanical ventilation may have markedly increased sedation needs compared with critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients without COVID-19. We conducted a study to examine sedative use for this patient population within multiple intensive care units (ICUs) of a large academic medical center. METHODS: A retrospective, single-center cohort study of sedation practices for critically ill patients with COVID-19 during the first 10 days of mechanical ventilation was conducted in 8 ICUs at Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA. The study population was a sequential cohort of 86 critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19. Data characterizing the sedative medications, doses, drug combinations, and duration of administration were collected daily and compared to published recommendations for sedation of critically ill patients without COVID-19. The associations between drug doses, number of drugs administered, baseline patient characteristics, and inflammatory markers were investigated. RESULTS: Among the study cohort, propofol and hydromorphone were the most common initial drug combination, with these medications being used on a given day in up to 100% and 88% of patients, respectively. The doses of sedative and analgesic infusions increased for patients over the first 10 days, reaching or exceeding the upper limits of published dosage guidelines for propofol (48% of patients), dexmedetomidine (29%), midazolam (7.7%), ketamine (32%), and hydromorphone (38%). The number of sedative and analgesic agents simultaneously administered increased over time for each patient, with more than 50% of patients requiring 3 or more agents by day 2. Compared with patients requiring 3 or fewer agents, patients requiring more than 3 agents were of younger age, had an increased body mass index, had increased serum ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase concentrations, had a lower Pao(2):Fio(2) (ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen), and were more likely to receive neuromuscular blockade. CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed the clinical impression of elevated sedative use in critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 relative to guideline-recommended sedation practices in other critically ill populations.","Balakrishna, Aditi; Walsh, Elisa C; Hamidi, Arzo; Berg, Sheri; Austin, Daniel; Pino, Richard M; Hanidziar, Dusan; Chang, Marvin G; Bittner, Edward A",Am J Health Syst Pharm,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33993212/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ajhp/zxab202,495

The aim of our study was to assess the psychological effects of COVID-19 epidemic on the healthcare workers in Hubei. METHODS: A total of 2737 healthcare workers were sampled using a two-dimensional code shared online between Mar 4 and Mar 9, 2020. The questionnaires consisted of three elements: baseline characteristics, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The primary outcome variables were PQSI, anxiety and depression scores of non-medical staff, non-frontline medical staff and frontline medical staff. Binary logistical regression analyses were used to compare between respondents with and without sleep disturbance. RESULTS: About 61.6% of the respondents reported sleep problems, 22.6% experienced anxiety, and 35% exhibited depressive symptoms. The prevalence of sleep disorders was higher among the frontline healthcare workers compared to the non-frontline and non-medical staff, while anxiety and depression were prevalent in the entire cohort. Logistic regression analysis identified medical occupation, family burden, bereavement, anxiety, and depression as significantly predictive of poor sleep quality. CONCLUSIONS: Frontline medical staff are more vulnerable to sleep disturbances. Psychosocial interventions are needed to help allied healthcare personnel to better respond to COVID-19 and future outbreaks.","Wang, Wei; Song, Wenqin; Xia, Zhongyuan; He, Yuhong; Tang, Linghua; Hou, Jiabao; Lei, Shaoqing",Front Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32793014/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00733,495

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cases (n=605) were defined by a positive covid-19 test result conducted between 16th March and 16th April 2020, during a restricted testing policy for hospitalised individuals with severe disease. RESULTS: A total of 406,793 participants were included. Mean age on 1st January 2020 was 68 years (range 48 to 85 years). 55% were women. In multivariable models, major independent risk factors for hospitalisation with covid-19 were male sex (odds ratio 1.52; 95% confidence interval 1.28 to 1.81; P<0.001), South Asian ethnicity (2.02; 1.28 to 3.17; P=0.002) or black ethnicity (3.09; 2.18 to 4.38; P<0.001) compared to white ethnicity, greater residential deprivation (1.92 for most deprived quartile compared to least deprived quartile; 1.50 to 2.47; P<0.001), higher BMI (2.04 for BMI >35 compared to <25 Kg/m2; 1.50 to 2.77; P<0.001), former smoking (1.39 compared to never smoked; 1.16 to 1.66; P<0.001), and comorbidities hypertension (1.28; 1.06 to 1.53; P=0.009) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (1.81; 1.34 to 2.44; P<0.001).

By using a panel data model for 2006–2017, phases of growth, recession, and recovery are scrutinised. A convergence process is identified, with higher growth rates for less-developed regions; however, the most developed regions are more resilient. Tourism demand is positively correlated with growth and resilience but a high share of tourism within regional employment has negative impacts on both. Specialisation patterns combining tourism with agriculture have positive effects in both cases.

By theorizing COVID-19 as a public bad, I shed light on one of the great debates of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries regarding the relationship between the United States and liberal international order (LIO). Conceptualizing the pandemic as a public bad, I analyze its consequences for US hegemony. Unlike other international public bads and many of the most important public goods that make up the LIO, the COVID-19 public bad not only has some degree of rivalry but can be made partially excludable, transforming it into more of a club good. Domestically, I demonstrate how the failure to effectively manage the COVID-19 public bad has compromised America's ability to secure the health of its citizens and the domestic economy, the very foundations for its international leadership. These failures jeopardize US provision of other global public goods. Internationally, I show how the US has already used the crisis strategically to reinforce its opposition to free international movement while abandoning the primary international institution tasked with fighting the public bad, the World Health Organization (WHO). While the only area where the United States has exercised leadership is in the monetary sphere, I argue this feat is more consequential for maintaining hegemony. However, even monetary hegemony could be at risk if the pandemic continues to be mismanaged.","Norrlöf, Carla",Int Aff,https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiaa134; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34191870/,495

It is instigated by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and there is an immediate need for the identification of effective drugs against this deadly virus. SARS-CoV-2 genome codes for four structural proteins, sixteen non-structural proteins (NSPs) and several accessory proteins for its survival inside the host cells. In the present study, through in silico approaches, we aim to identify compounds that are effective against the four NSPs namely, NSP1, NSP4, NSP6 and NSP13 of SARS-CoV-2. The selection criteria of these four NSP proteins are they are least explored and potential targets. First, we have modeled the 3D structures of these proteins using homology modeling methods. Further, through molecular docking studies, we have screened the FDA-approved compounds against these modeled proteins and reported their docking scores. To gain dynamic insights, molecular dynamics studies have also been carried out for the best scored ligand against the NSPs. This study can further pave way for exposing more number of compounds against these proteins and enhance COVID-19 treatment.

About 10% of them will be hospitalized, with significant physical and economic burdens. OBJECTIVES: To compare two cohorts of infants with AVB, from same region, in a ten-year interval, regarding epidemiologic factors and viral etiology. STUDY DESIGN: Cohorts: 142 (2004) and 172 (2014) infants at ages zero to 12 months; clinical diagnosis of AVB; medical care in hospital and genetic screening of nasopharyngeal secretion for respiratory viruses. RESULTS: The comparative analysis showed a difference in the percentage of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) positive patients [2004 (33.1%); 2014 (70.3%)] (p < 0.01). No differences were noted regarding gender, breastfeeding, tobacco exposure, crowding and maternal education. There was a difference as to the month of incidence (seasonality) of AVB (higher in April 2014). There was a higher age at attendance in the first cohort, and lower birth weight and gestational age ratios in the second cohort (p < 0.05). There were no differences in hospitalization time, need of mechanical ventilation and number of deaths, however a difference regarding co-morbidities was noted (higher in 2004) (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: None of the analyzed variables had an impact on severity features. Virology and immunology must be considered in this kind of situation, by studying genetic variants and the maturation of the immune system in AVB by RSV or other viruses.","Wollmeister, Elinara; Alvarez, Alfonso Eduardo; Bastos, Juliana Cristina Santiago; Marson, Fernando Augusto Lima; Ribeiro, José Dirceu; Baracat, Emílio Carlos Elias; Arns, Clarice Weis; Riccetto, Adriana Gut Lopes",J Clin Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29227860/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2017.12.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S138665321730330X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S138665321730330X,495

Thus, the aim of this study was to examine the impact of Covid-19 infection on pregnant women in the United Arab Emirates population. METHODS: A case-control study was carried out to compare the clinical course and outcome of pregnancy in 79 pregnant women with Covid-19 and 85 non-pregnant women with Covid-19 admitted to Latifa Hospital in Dubai between March and June 2020. RESULTS: Although Pregnant women presented with fewer symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat, and shortness of breath compared to non-pregnant women; yet they ran a much more severe course of illness. On admission, 12/79 (15.2%) Vs 2/85 (2.4%) had a chest radiograph score [on a scale 1-6] of ≥3 (p-value = 0.0039). On discharge, 6/79 (7.6%) Vs 1/85 (1.2%) had a score ≥3 (p-value = 0.0438). They also had much higher levels of laboratory indicators of severity with values above reference ranges for C-Reactive Protein [(28 (38.3%) Vs 13 (17.6%)] with p < 0.004; and for D-dimer [32 (50.8%) Vs 3(6%)]; with p < 0.001.

CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant women presented with fewer Covid-19 symptoms but ran a much more severe course of illness compared to non-pregnant women with the disease. They had worse chest radiograph scores and much higher levels of laboratory indicators of disease severity. They had more ICU admissions and suffered more complications of Covid-19 infection, such as risk for miscarriage and preterm deliveries.

MATERIAL/METHODS: This retrospective analysis included 68 patients with COVID-19 in the Fifth People’s Hospital of Suzhou City. Three radiologists performed a blind evaluation of 4 chest CT images that included the initial scans, the lesion peak, the lesion decreased to 25% of the peak, and the final scan. The score of chest CT lesion, the imaging characteristics of the lesion, the time of the appearance of symptoms related to the CT examination, quantitative assessment of PIT(25), and the absorption of the lesion in last CT image were analyzed. Patients were divided into an obvious absorption group and a non-obvious absorption group according to the reduction of the lesion area by greater than 50% or less than 50%. RESULTS: In the peak time, the most common images of CT were ground-glass opacities (94.1%), consolidation (85.3%) and reticulation (88.2%), multifocal (97.1%), center and subpleural (54.4%), subpleural distribution (45.6%), and pleural thickening (79.4%). The PIT(25) with the prognosis (r=0.53, p=0.00) was significantly relevant. PIT(25) was 4.3±0.7 days for the obvious absorption group and 6.8±1.4 days for the non-obvious absorption group. CONCLUSIONS: The features of CT image are specific at the peak. The quantitative parameter PIT(25) could be used to predict the prognosis of the patients with COVID-19, as COVID-19 patients with a shorter PIT(25) have a better prognosis and vice versa.","Liu, Rongrong; Chen, Guangqiang; Zhu, Yi; Liu, Jing; Tang, Wei; Zhu, Jianbing; Li, Min",Med Sci Monit,https://doi.org/10.12659/msm.925183; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33201864/,495

In Experiment 1, we tested how adults (18–22-year-olds) and children (8–10-year-olds) categorized affective states communicated by vocalizations varying continuously from “calm” to “upset.” We found that the threshold for categorizing both verbal (i.e., spoken word) and nonverbal (i.e., a yell) vocalizations as “upset” depended on the statistical distribution of the stimuli participants encountered. In Experiment 2, we replicated and extended these findings in adults using vocalizations that conveyed multiple negative affect states.

Beyond the current pandemic, teleconsultation is considered a significant opportunity to address persistent health system challenges, including accessibility, continuity, and cost of care, while ensuring quality. OBJECTIVE: This study aims at identifying the determinants of patients’ intention to continue using a teleconsultation platform. It extends prior research on information technology use continuance intention and teleconsultation services. METHODS: Data was collected in November 2018 and May 2019 with Canadian patients who had access to a teleconsultation platform. Measures included patients’ intention to continue their use; teleconsultation usefulness; teleconsultation quality; patients’ trust toward the digital platform, its provider. and health care professionals; and confirmation of patients’ expectations toward teleconsultation. We used structural equation modeling employing the partial least squares component-based technique to test our research model and hypotheses. RESULTS: We analyzed a sample of 178 participants who had used teleconsultation services. Our findings revealed that confirmation of expectations had the greatest influence on continuance intention (total effects=0.722; P<.001), followed by usefulness (total effects=0.587; P<.001) and quality (total effects=0.511; P<.001). Usefulness (β=.60; P<.001) and quality (β=.34; P=.01) had direct effects on the dependent variable. The confirmation of expectations had direct effects both on usefulness (β=.56; P<.001) and quality (β=.75; P<.001) in addition to having an indirect effect on usefulness (indirect effects=0.282; P<.001). Last, quality directly influenced usefulness (β=.34; P=.002) and trust (β=.88; P<.001). Trust does not play a role in the context under study. CONCLUSIONS: Teleconsultation is central to care going forward, and it represents a significant lever for an improved, digital delivery of health care in the future.

The commuting population is associated with edges and is associated with one of the end nodes of the edge during part of the time period and with the other node during the remainder of the time period. The progression of the disease at each node is determined via compartment models, that include vaccination rates and testing to place infected people in quarantine along with consideration of asymptomatic and symptomatic populations.

METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Google Scholar, and medRxiv (preprint repository) databases (up to 7 January 2021). Pooled effect sizes with 95% confidence interval (CI) were generated using random-effects and inverse variance heterogeneity models. The risk of bias of the included RCTs was appraised using version 2 of the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials. RESULTS: Six RCTs were included: two trials with an overall low risk of bias and four trials had some concerns regarding the overall risk of bias. Our meta-analysis did not find significant mortality benefits with the use of tocilizumab among patients with COVID-19 relative to non-use of tocilizumab (pooled hazard ratio = 0.83; 95% CI 0.66–1.05, n = 2,057). Interestingly, the estimated effect of tocilizumab on the composite endpoint of requirement for mechanical ventilation and/or all-cause mortality indicated clinical benefits, with some evidence against our model hypothesis of no significant effect at the current sample size (pooled hazard ratio = 0.62; 95% CI 0.42–0.91, n = 749).

METHODS: Prospective, multicentre, randomized study in children presenting with FN at five hospitals in Santiago, Chile, evaluated at admission for diagnosis of bacterial and viral pathogens including PCR-microarray for 17 respiratory viruses. Children positive for a respiratory virus, negative for a bacterial pathogen and with a favourable evolution after 48 h of antimicrobial therapy were randomized to either maintain or withhold antimicrobials. Primary endpoint was percentage of episodes with uneventful resolution. Secondary endpoints were days of fever/hospitalization, bacterial infection, sepsis, admission to paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and death. RESULTS: A total of 319 of 951 children with FN episodes recruited between July 2012 and December 2015 had a respiratory virus as a unique identified microorganism, of which 176 were randomized, 92 to maintain antimicrobials and 84 to withdraw. Median duration of antimicrobial use was 7 days (range 7–9 days) versus 3 days (range 3–4 days), with similar frequency of uneventful resolution (89/92 (97%) and 80/84 (95%), respectively, not significant; OR 1.48; 95% CI 0.32–6.83, p 0.61), and similar number of days of fever (2 versus 1), days of hospitalization (6 versus 6) and bacterial infections throughout the episode (2%–1%), with one case of sepsis requiring admission to PICU in the group that maintained antimicrobials, without any deaths.

In the presence of Cu(2+), Cu(2+) will recognize the Cu DNA substrate and form an “off-on” signal switch, thereby resulting in the separation of invertase from the Fe(3)O(4) nanospheres. PPi recognizes Cu(2+) to form a Cu(2+)-PPi complex, resulting in an “on-off” signal switch. Under optimized conditions, linear detection ranges for Cu(2+) and PPi of 0.01–5 and 0.5–10 μM, and detection limits for Cu(2+) and PPi of 10 nM and 500 nM, respectively, were obtained. Good selectivity was achieved for the analysis of Cu(2+) and PPi. Satisfactory results were achieved for this biosensor during the determination of Cu(2+) in real tap samples and PPi in human urine samples. This verified that the sensor is portable and low cost, and can be applied to the sequential monitoring of multiple analytes with a single point-of-care biosensor.

668773,Cohort profile: the Ontario Life After Workplace Injury Study (OLAWIS),2021-09-06,"This paper considers how to allocate Covid-19 vaccines to different age groups when limited vaccines are available over time. The disease dynamics is specified by an age-structured SAPHIRE model whose parameters are estimated by the standard least square method using the epidemic data from New York City. We derive optimal static allocation policies with different objectives under different amounts of daily available vaccines, and examine several dynamic allocation heuristics including old-first policy, infection-first policy, myopic policy, death-weighted myopic policy, and two-day myopic policy. For static policies, our numerical study shows that to minimize the total deaths, it is optimal to allocate limited vaccines to the oldest group first and then the younger group if there are capacities remaining. In contrast, to minimize the total confirmed cases, the optimal static policy allocates a considerable portion of vaccines to younger groups even if the daily available vaccines are very limited. The optimal static policies achieve a much smaller number of confirmed cases and deaths compared to two benchmark policies: a uniform allocation policy that allocates available vaccines equally to each age group, and a proportional allocation policy that allocates available vaccines proportionally to the population of each age group. For dynamic allocation policies, the myopic policy and the two-day myopic policy have similar performance and significantly outperforms the other dynamic heuristics and the static policies in terms of the confirmed cases and deaths.","Chen, X.; Li, M.; Simchi-Levi, D.; Zhao, T.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.23.20179820; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.23.20179820v1?rss=1,495
668792,"Excess Out-Of-Hospital Mortality and Declining Oxygen Saturation: The Sentinel Role of EMS Data in the COVID-19 Crisis in Tijuana, Mexico",2020-05-19,"Background: Acute lung injury (ALI) or its most advanced form, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe inflammatory pulmonary process triggered by a variety of insults including sepsis, viral or bacterial pneumonia, and mechanical ventilator-induced trauma. Currently, there are no effective therapies available for ARDS. We have recently reported that a novel small molecule AVR-25 derived from chitin molecule (a long-chain polymer of N-acetylglucosamine) showed anti-inflammatory effects in the lungs. The goal of this study was to determine the efficacy of two chitin-derived compounds, AVR-25 and AVR-48, in multiple mouse models of ALI/ARDS. We further determined the safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of the lead compound AVR-48 in rats. Methods: ALI in mice was induced by intratracheal instillation of a single dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 100 µg) for 24 h or exposed to hyperoxia (100% oxygen) for 48 h or undergoing cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) procedure and observation for 10 days. Results: Both chitin derivatives, AVR-25 and AVR-48, showed decreased neutrophil recruitment and reduced inflammation in the lungs of ALI mice. Further, AVR-25 and AVR-48 mediated diminished lung inflammation was associated with reduced expression of lung adhesion molecules with improvement in pulmonary endothelial barrier function, pulmonary edema, and lung injury. Consistent with these results, CLP-induced sepsis mice treated with AVR-48 showed a significant increase in survival of the mice (80%) and improved lung histopathology in the treated CLP group. AVR-48, the lead chitin derivative compound, demonstrated a good safety profile. Conclusion: Both AVR-25 and AVR-48 demonstrate the potential to be developed as therapeutic agents to treat ALI/ARDS.","Shah, Dilip; Das, Pragnya; Acharya, Suchismita; Agarwal, Beamon; Christensen, Dale J.; Robertson, Stella M.; Bhandari, Vineet",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33806560/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22052573,495

By taking a classic herbal formula (Yu Ping Feng decoction, YPF) as an example, this study developed a novel network pharmacology based method to identify its potential therapeutic targets. First, this study constructed a “targets–(pathways)–targets” (TPT) network in which targets of YPF were connected by relevant pathways; then, this network was decomposed into separate modules with strong internal connections; lastly, the propensity of each module toward different diseases was assessed by a contribution score. On the basis of a significant association between network modules and therapeutic diseases validated by chi-square test (p-value < 0.001), this study identified the network module with the strongest propensity toward therapeutic diseases of YPF. Further, the targets with the highest centrality in this module are recommended as YPF’s potential therapeutic targets. By integrating the complicated “multi-targets–multi-pathways–multi-diseases” relationship of herbal formulas, the method shows promise for identifying its potential therapeutic targets, which could contribute to the modern scientific illustration of TCMs’ traditional clinical applications.","Zuo, Huali; Zhang, Qianru; Su, Shibing; Chen, Qilong; Yang, Fengqing; Hu, Yuanjia",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-29764-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30061691/,495
669979,Evaluation of anxiety and fear of COVID-19 in patients admitted to an ophthalmology outpatient clinic,2021,"Background: Few ontological attempts have been reported for conceptualizing the bioethics domain. In addition to limited scope representativeness and lack of robust methodological approaches in driving research design and evaluation of bioethics ontologies, no bioethics ontologies exist for pandemics and COVID-19. This research attempted to investigate whether studying the bioethics research literature, from the inception of bioethics research publications, facilitates developing highly agile, and representative computational bioethics ontology as a foundation for the automatic governance of bioethics processes in general and the COVID-19 pandemic in particular. Research Design: The iOntoBioethics agile research framework adopted the Design Science Research Methodology. Using systematic literature mapping, the search space resulted in 26,170 Scopus indexed bioethics articles, published since 1971. iOntoBioethics underwent two distinctive stages: (1) Manually Constructing Bioethics (MCB) ontology from selected bioethics sources, and (2) Automatically generating bioethics ontological topic models with all 26,170 sources and using special-purpose developed Text Mining and Machine-Learning (TM&ML) engine. Bioethics domain experts validated these ontologies, and further extended to construct and validate the Bioethics COVID-19 Pandemic Ontology. Results: Cross-validation of the MCB and TM&ML bioethics ontologies confirmed that the latter provided higher-level abstraction for bioethics entities with well-structured bioethics ontology class hierarchy compared to the MCB ontology. However, both bioethics ontologies were found to complement each other forming a highly comprehensive Bioethics Ontology with around 700 concepts and associations COVID-19 inclusive. Conclusion: The iOntoBioethics framework yielded the first agile, semi-automatically generated, literature-based, and domain experts validated General Bioethics and Bioethics Pandemic Ontologies Operable in COVID-19 context with readiness for automatic governance of bioethics processes. These ontologies will be regularly and semi-automatically enriched as iOntoBioethics is proposed as an open platform for scientific and healthcare communities, in their infancy COVID-19 learning stage. iOntoBioethics not only it contributes to better understanding of bioethics processes, but also serves as a bridge linking these processes to healthcare systems. Such big data analytics platform has the potential to automatically inform bioethics governance adherence given the plethora of developing bioethics and COVID-19 pandemic knowledge. Finally, iOntoBioethics contributes toward setting the first building block for forming the field of “Bioethics Informatics”.","Odeh, Mohammed; Kharbat, Faten F.; Yousef, Rana; Odeh, Yousra; Tbaishat, Dina; Hakooz, Nancy; Dajani, Rana; Mansour, Asem",Front Med (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34095160/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.619978,495

At 1.2-μM concentration, lycorine reduced viral titers of West Nile (WNV), dengue, and yellow fever viruses by 10(2)- to 10(4)-fold. However, the compound did not inhibit an alphavirus (Western equine encephalitis virus) or a rhabdovirus (vesicular stomatitis virus), indicating a selective antiviral spectrum. The compound exerts its antiviral activity mainly through suppression of viral RNA replication. A Val→Met substitution at the 9th amino acid position of the viral 2K peptide (spanning the endoplasmic reticulum membrane between NS4A and NS4B proteins) confers WNV resistance to lycorine, through enhancement of viral RNA replication. Initial chemistry synthesis demonstrated that modifications of the two hydroxyl groups of lycorine can increase the compound’s potency, while reducing its cytotoxicity. Taken together, the results have established lycorine as a flavivirus inhibitor for antiviral development. The lycorine-resistance results demonstrate a direct role of the 2K peptide in flavivirus RNA synthesis.","Zou, Gang; Puig-Basagoiti, Francesc; Zhang, Bo; Qing, Min; Chen, Liqiang; Pankiewicz, Krzysztof W.; Felczak, Krzysztof; Yuan, Zhiming; Shi, Pei-Yong",Virology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682208007319; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc5388927?pdf=render; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682208007319; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19062063/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2008.11.003,495

We interrogate whether Foucaldianism contributed, in the past as well today, towards a certain myopia in France regarding biostatistics and its relation to social inequalities in health.

In 2002, a research project was carried out in a range of sectors of the Australian tourism industry to investigate the impact of the collapse of the HIH Insurance Company, the World Trade Centre attacks and the demise of Ansett Airlines on these organisations and the range of responses adopted to these events. This paper describes the preparedness of organisations to respond to these events; the personnel or human resource (HR) strategies implemented and the postscript, the organisational learning which had occurred.

Parmi celles-ci, nous rapportons quatre cas d’une éruption vésiculeuse dont les caractéristiques cliniques et histologiques apparaissent à même de constituer une entité autonome. Matériel et méthodes Durant le mois d’avril 2020, quatre cas d’éruption vésiculeuse satellite d’une infection au SARS-CoV-2 (prouvée par la positivité d’un frottis nasopharyngien) ont été observés dans notre institution. Tous les patients ont eu une biopsie cutanée, trois, une recherche de coronavirus sur une vésicule. Résultats La présentation clinique était univoque : éruption vésiculeuse monomorphe, intéressant constamment le tronc (plus particulièrement le dos), peu ou pas prurigineuse, guérissant en une à trois semaines ; le seul cas où le prurit était sévère et prolongé était compliqué secondairement d’une gale. L’examen histologique montrait dans tous les cas une acantholyse suprabasale avec constitution d’une bulle intraépidermique, ainsi qu’une dyskératose éosinophilique très marquée. Des aspects plus spécifiquement évocateurs d’un effet cytopathogène viral (inclusions nucléaires, cellules bi ou trinucléées) étaient observés une fois. La recherche de SARS-Cov-2 sur les frottis cutanés était négative. Discussion Ces quatre observations étaient remarquablement homogènes sur le plan clinique aussi bien qu’histologique. Ainsi, le tableau anatomoclinique réalisé apparaissait à même de constituer une entité originale n’ayant que peu à voir avec d’autres éruptions virales, notamment une varicelle dont la clinique et l’histologie sont nettement différentes. La dermatose acantholytique transitoire de Grover s’en rapproche par certains points, mais en diffère par d’autres (contexte, importance de la dyskératose, aspects viraux). Pour désigner cette entité, plutôt que le terme initialement utilisé dans la littérature d’éruption “varicelle-like”, nous suggérons l’intitulé “éruption acantholytique associée à la COVID-19”. Sur le plan physiopathologique, le récepteur ACE2 du SARS-CoV-2 a été identifié à la surface des cellules basales épidermiques, suggérant un possible effet pathogène particulier à ce niveau. Malgré la négativité de la recherche de virus sur les lésions, peut-être en fait liée à des insuffisances techniques, l’observation occasionnelle d’un effet cytopathogène suggère une certaine contagiosité, incitant à maintenir des mesures d’isolement en cas de lésions de ce type.","Mahé, A.; Merklen, C.; Birckel, E.; Blind, A.; Bottlaender, L.; Lefèbvre, P.; Droy-Dupré, L.",Annales de Dermatologie et de Vénéréologie,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0151963820306384; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0151963820306384,495
670526,Incorporating Aboriginal women’s voices in improving care and reducing risk for women with diabetes in pregnancy - A phenomenological study,2021-09-16,"BACKGROUND: Influenza-like illness (ILI) definitions have been infrequently studied in young children. Despite this, clinical definitions of ILI play an important role in influenza surveillance. This study aims to identify clinical predictors of influenza infection in children ≤5 years old from which age-specific ILI definitions are then constructed. METHODS: Children aged 6–59 months with a history of fever and acute respiratory symptoms were recruited in the Western Australia Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness (WAIVE) Study. Clinical data and per-nasal specimens were obtained from all children. Logistic regression identified significant predictors of influenza infection. Different ILI definitions were compared for diagnostic accuracy. RESULTS: Children were recruited from 2 winter influenza seasons (2008–2009; n = 944). Of 919 eligible children, 179 (19.5%) had laboratory-confirmed influenza infection. Predictors of infection included increasing age, lack of influenza vaccination, lower birth weight, fever, cough, and absence of wheeze. An ILI definition comprising fever ≥38°C, cough, and no wheeze had 58% sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI], 50–66), 60% specificity (95% CI, 56–64), 26% positive predictive value (95% CI, 21–31), and 86% negative predictive value (95% CI, 82–89). The addition of other symptoms or higher fever thresholds to ILI definition had little impact. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definition of ILI (presence of fever [≥37.8°C] and cough and/or sore throat) was sensitive (92%; 95% CI, 86–95), yet lacked specificity (10%; 95% CI, 8–13) in this population. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza-like illness is a poor predictor of laboratory-confirmed influenza infection in young children but can be improved using age-specific data. Incorporating age-specific ILI definitions and/or diagnostic testing into influenza surveillance systems will improve the accuracy of epidemiological data.","Conway, Nicholas T.; Wake, Zoe V.; Richmond, Peter C.; Smith, David W.; Keil, Anthony D.; Williams, Simon; Kelly, Heath; Carcione, Dale; Effler, Paul V.; Blyth, Christopher C.",J Pediatric Infect Dis Soc,https://doi.org/10.1093/jpids/pis081; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26619439/,495

We received 483 valid responses that were analysed using structural equation modelling approach with bootstrapping to test the hypothetical path model and its invariance across the moderators. RESULTS: The analysis revealed that pressure to eat fully mediated the effects of childhood food allergy and restriction on parental unhealthy food choices for their children. Finally, we found that parental gender moderated the relationship between childhood food allergy and the pressure to eat. CONCLUSIONS: The paper contributes to the literature on food allergies among children and the marginalisation of families with allergies. Our explorative model is a first of its kind and offers a fresh perspective on complex relationships between variables under consideration. Although our data collection took place prior to Covid-19 outbreak, this paper bears yet particular significance as it casts light on how families with allergies should be part of the priority groups to have access to food supply during crisis periods.","Mahmoud, Ali B.; Hack-Polay, Dieu; Fuxman, Leonora; Naquiallah, Dina; Grigoriou, Nicholas",BMC Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32977776/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-020-09556-x,495

This meta-analysis was strictly focused on the influence of smoking history on the severe and critical outcomes on people with COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted in eight online databases before 1 February 2021. All studies meeting our selection criteria were included and evaluated. Stata 14.0 software was used to analyze the data. Results: A total of 109 articles involving 517,020 patients were included in this meta-analysis. A statistically significant association was discovered between smoking history and COVID-19 severity, the pooled OR was 1.55 (95%CI: 1.41-1.71). Smoking was significantly associated with the risk of admission to intensive care unit (ICU) (OR=1.73, 95%CI: 1.36-2.19), increased mortality (OR=1.58, 95%CI: 1.38-1.81), and critical diseases composite endpoints (OR=1.61, 95%CI: 1.35-1.93), whereas there was no relationship with mechanical ventilation. The pooled prevalence of smoking using the random effects model (REM) was 15% (95%CI: 14%-16%).

Currently, we have a limited toolset available for visualizing SARS-CoV-2 in cells and tissues, particularly in tissues from patients who died from COVID-19. Generally, single-molecule RNA FISH techniques have shown mixed results in formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissues such as those preserved from human autopsies. Here, we present a platform for preparing autopsy tissue for visualizing SARS-CoV-2 RNA using RNA FISH with amplification by hybridization chain reaction (HCR). We developed probe sets that target different regions of SARS-CoV-2 (including ORF1a and N) as well as probe sets that specifically target SARS-CoV-2 subgenomic mRNAs. We validated these probe sets in cell culture and tissues (lung, lymph node, and placenta) from infected patients. Using this technology, we observe distinct subcellular localization patterns of the ORF1a and N regions, with the ORF1a concentrated around the nucleus and the N showing a diffuse distribution across the cytoplasm. In human lung tissue, we performed multiplexed RNA FISH HCR for SARS-CoV-2 and cell-type specific marker genes. We found viral RNA in cells containing the alveolar type 2 (AT2) cell marker gene (SFTPC) and the alveolar macrophage marker gene (MARCO), but did not identify viral RNA in cells containing the alveolar type 1 (AT1) cell marker gene (AGER). Moreover, we observed distinct subcellular localization patterns of viral RNA in AT2 cells and alveolar macrophages, consistent with phagocytosis of infected cells. In sum, we demonstrate the use of RNA FISH HCR for visualizing different RNA species from SARS-CoV-2 in cell lines and FFPE autopsy specimens. Furthermore, we multiplex this assay with probes for cellular genes to determine what cell-types are infected within the lung.

He continued with maintenance immunotherapy and was asymptomatic for eight months after completing radiation therapy. He then developed symptoms consistent with pneumonitis within three to five days of his first administration of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine injection. He reported that these symptoms significantly intensified within three to five days of receiving his second dose of the vaccine. The clinical time frame and radiographic evidence raised suspicion for radiation recall pneumonitis (RRP). Patients undergoing maintenance immunotherapy after prior irradiation may be at increased risk of this phenomenon that may be triggered by the administration of the COVID-19 vaccine.","Steber, Cole R; Ponnatapura, Janardhana; Hughes, Ryan T; Farris, Michael K",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.14303; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33968515/,495

This article addresses the global threat of the anticipated overlap of COVID-19 with seasonal-influenza. OBJECTIVES: Scientific evidence based on simulation methodology is presented to reveal the impact of a dual outbreak, with scenarios intended for propagation analysis. This article aims at researchers, clinicians of family medicine, general practice and policy-makers worldwide. The implications for the clinical practice of primary health care are discussed. Current research is an effort to explore new directions in epidemiology and health services delivery. METHODS: Projections consisted of machine learning, dynamic modelling algorithms and whole simulations. Input data consisted of global indicators of infectious diseases. Four simulations were run for ‘20% versus 60% flu-vaccinated populations’ and ‘10 versus 20 personal contacts’. Outputs consisted of numerical values and mathematical graphs. Outputs consisted of numbers for ‘never infected’, ‘vaccinated’, ‘infected/recovered’, ‘symptomatic/asymptomatic’ and ‘deceased’ individuals. Peaks, percentages, R(0), durations are reported. RESULTS: The best-case scenario was one with a higher flu-vaccination rate and fewer contacts. The reverse generated the worst outcomes, likely to disrupt the provision of vital community services. Both measures were proven effective; however, results demonstrated that ‘increasing flu-vaccination rates’ is a more powerful strategy than ‘limiting social contacts’. CONCLUSIONS: Results support two affordable preventive measures: (i) to globally increase influenza-vaccination rates, (ii) to limit the number of personal contacts during outbreaks. The authors endorse changing practices and research incentives towards multidisciplinary collaborations. The urgency of the situation is a call for international health policy to promote interdisciplinary modern technologies in public health engineering.","Tunaligil, Verda; Meral, Gulsen; Dabak, Mustafa Resat; Canbulat, Mehmet; Demir, Sıddıka Semahat",Fam Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34448486/; https://doi.org/10.1093/fampra/cmab058,495

This dangerous virus has dissimilar effects in different countries in the world. It is observable that the number of new active coronavirus cases is increasing day by day across the globe. India is now in the second stage of COVID-19 spreading, and as a densely populated country, it will be an epidemic very quickly if proper protection / strategies are not under-taken based on the database of the transmission of the disease. This paper is using the current data of COVID-19 for the mathematical modeling and its dynamical analysis. As an alternative of the standard SEIR model, we bring in a new representation to appraise and manage the outbreak of infectious disease COVID-19 through SEQIR pandemic model, which is based on the supposition that the infected but undetected by testing individuals are send to quarantine during the incubation period. During the incubation period if any individual be infected by COVID-19, then that confirmed infected individuals are isolated and the necessary treatments are arranged in proper way so that they cannot taint the other residents in the community.

Online fever clinics were developed by hospitals, largely relieving the hospital’s burden. Online fever clinics could help people stay out of crowded hospitals and prevent the risk of cross infections. The objective of our study was to describe the patient characteristics of an online fever clinic and explore the most important concerns and question of online patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study extracted data from fever clinic records in medical information systems from January 24 to February 18, 2020 in a tertiary hospital in Wuhan. We described the characteristics of patients in fever clinic, then we extracted and classified questions of patient consultations through the online fever clinic dataset. RESULTS: For the 64 487 patients who attended the online fever clinic, the average age was 30.4 years, and 37 665 (58.4%) were female patients. The current state of patients from online were home without isolation (52 360 [81.2%]), home isolated (11 152 [17.29%]), and outpatient observation (975 [1.51%]). From the 594 patient questions analyzed, confirming diagnosis and seeking medical treatment account for 60.61% and 38.05%, respectively, followed by treating (25.59%), preventing (4.38%), and relieving anxiety (1.68%). DISCUSSION: Online fever clinics can effectively relieve patients’ mood of panic, and doctors can guide patients with suspected of COVID-19 to isolate and protect themselves through online fever clinic. Online fever clinics can also help to reduce the pressure of hospital fever clinics and prevent cross infection.

This is a descriptive phenomenological study that included ten participants using convenience sampling with maximum variation in a tertiary hospital in Seoul, South Korea. Colaizzi’s data analysis method was used to inductively determine themes and formulate meanings. The three main themes derived from analysis were: “frustration with seeing a patient suffering”, “burnout at the cost of a life of dedication”, and “desperate need for help”. Caregivers experience high levels of suffering, which can come in various forms depending on the circumstances of the particular patient and family. Especially, distress from seeing a loved one suffering was another aspect of suffering in Korean ALS caregivers, reflecting strong family ties. At the same time, patients are in desperate need of help and support from their families. Thus, it is essential to provide care to lessen the causes of distress and meet the needs of not only patients, but also caregivers through family-centered care to improve overall quality of life for all involved.","Oh, Juyeon; Kim, Jung-A; Chu, Min Sun",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18094937; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34066364/,495

The 2016 Model of Clinical Practice according to the American Board of EM identifies disaster management as an integral task of EM physicians. We described a low-cost and feasible tabletop exercise to implement such training for EM residents. METHODS: The exercise took place during 2 hours of resident didactic time. A lecture introduced the incident command system (ICS) and triage concepts, followed by a tabletop scenario with a map of a disaster scene or emergency department. Facilitators presented situational prompts of tasks for residents to address during the exercise. These exposed residents to challenges in disaster scenarios, such as surge and limited resources. The exercise concluded with a debrief and short lecture reviewing scenario-specific topics and challenges. Residents completed an online pre- and postexercise assessment, evaluating knowledge and perceptions of disaster scenario management. RESULTS: Eighteen residents participated in this exercise. The response rates to the pre- and postsurvey were 76% and 72% respectively. Using a Mann Whitney U test, no statistically significant difference was demonstrated on the medical knowledge component of the survey. There was, however, a statistically significant increase in perceived confidence of the residents' ability to manage disaster incidents. DISCUSSION: We developed a simple exercise that is an easily adaptable and practical option for introduction to disaster preparedness training. These concepts are difficult to teach and assess among learners, however it remains an important component of education for EM physicians-in-training.","Sena, Ariel; Forde, Frank; Yu, Catherine; Sule, Harsh; Masters, M.

Objective: To estimate the association between administration of IL-6 antagonists compared with usual care or placebo and 28-day all-cause mortality and other outcomes. Data Sources: Trials were identified through systematic searches of electronic databases between October 2020 and January 2021. Searches were not restricted by trial status or language. Additional trials were identified through contact with experts. Study Selection: Eligible trials randomly assigned patients hospitalized for COVID-19 to a group in whom IL-6 antagonists were administered and to a group in whom neither IL-6 antagonists nor any other immunomodulators except corticosteroids were administered. Among 72 potentially eligible trials, 27 (37.5%) met study selection criteria. Data Extraction and Synthesis: In this prospective meta-analysis, risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. Inconsistency among trial results was assessed using the I2 statistic. The primary analysis was an inverse variance-weighted fixed-effects meta-analysis of odds ratios (ORs) for 28-day all-cause mortality. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality at 28 days after randomization. There were 9 secondary outcomes including progression to invasive mechanical ventilation or death and risk of secondary infection by 28 days. Results: A total of 10â¯930 patients (median age, 61 years [range of medians, 52-68 years]; 3560 [33%] were women) participating in 27 trials were included. By 28 days, there were 1407 deaths among 6449 patients randomized to IL-6 antagonists and 1158 deaths among 4481 patients randomized to usual care or placebo (summary OR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.79-0.95]; P = .003 based on a fixed-effects meta-analysis). This corresponds to an absolute mortality risk of 22% for IL-6 antagonists compared with an assumed mortality risk of 25% for usual care or placebo. The corresponding summary ORs were 0.83 (95% CI, 0.74-0.92; P < .001) for tocilizumab and 1.08 (95% CI, 0.86-1.36; P = .52) for sarilumab. The summary ORs for the association with mortality compared with usual care or placebo in those receiving corticosteroids were 0.77 (95% CI, 0.68-0.87) for tocilizumab and 0.92 (95% CI, 0.61-1.38) for sarilumab. The ORs for the association with progression to invasive mechanical ventilation or death, compared with usual care or placebo, were 0.77 (95% CI, 0.70-0.85) for all IL-6 antagonists, 0.74 (95% CI, 0.66-0.82) for tocilizumab, and 1.00 (95% CI, 0.74-1.34) for sarilumab. Secondary infections by 28 days occurred in 21.9% of patients treated with IL-6 antagonists vs 17.6% of patients treated with usual care or placebo (OR accounting for trial sample sizes, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.85-1.16). Conclusions and Relevance: In this prospective meta-analysis of clinical trials of patients hospitalized for COVID-19, administration of IL-6 antagonists, compared with usual care or placebo, was associated with lower 28-day all-cause mortality.

685402,A healthy degree of suspicion: A discussion of the implementation of transmission based precautions in the emergency department,2016-04-28,"Introduction La pandémie d’infections à SARS-CoV-2 a conduit à une réorganisation des services de soins en « filières COVID-19 » et « non COVID-19 » au sein de nombreux hôpitaux avec pour objectifs l’orientation précoce vers une prise en charge spécifique des patients COVID-19 et la limitation des risques de transmission au sein de ces établissements. En complément de ces mesures, une surveillance active de la survenue de cas dans les filières « non COVID-19 » a été indispensable pour optimiser la gestion de l’épidémie au sein de notre établissement. Le déploiement d’une équipe mobile (EM) de prélèvement, basée sur une organisation pluridisciplinaire, avait pour but de réaliser ces dépistages dans des conditions optimales pour les patients et les soignants. Matériels et méthodes Les demandes de prélèvements rhinopharyngés étaient systématiquement soumises aux cliniciens du service de Maladies Infectieuses pour validation des indications : prélèvement de cas possibles sur la base d’arguments cliniques et d’imagerie ou prélèvements à visée systématique. L’EM était composée d’un binôme d’internes, rapidement mobilisable sur les 5 sites du CHU. Au sein des services cliniques concernés, l’EM était chargée de la réalisation du prélèvement ainsi que de l’accompagnement de l’équipe soignante autour des précautions d’hygiène spécifiques à mettre en place dans l’attente des résultats biologiques. Le prélèvement était acheminé aussitôt au laboratoire de virologie pour recherche de SARS-CoV-2 par biologie moléculaire. Résultats Sur les 158 prélèvements pris en charge par l’EM, 66 % l’ont été pour des suspicions cliniques et 34 % à visée systématique. Toute indication confondue, la tranche d’âge majoritaire était celle des plus de 80 ans (32 %), suivie par les 65–79 ans (23 %) et 50–64 ans (23 %), la population pédiatrique était minoritaire (1 %). Pour les patients symptomatiques, les signes cliniques prédominants étaient la fièvre (66 %), la toux (21 %), les troubles respiratoires à type de dyspnée et désaturation (21 %), la présence de critères d’imagerie évocateurs (17 %) et les diarrhées (16 %). Le délai moyen entre l’apparition des symptômes et la suspicion clinique ayant conduit à la réalisation du prélèvement était de 3jours. Parmi les suspicions cliniques, 4 cas positifs ont été détectés par PCR et aucun parmi les dépistages systématiques. Conclusion En complément de la réorganisation des services de soins « COVID-19 », la mise en place d’une équipe mobilisable a permis une surveillance de terrain en temps réel. L’EM a ainsi contribué au diagnostic de COVID-19 pour 4 patients initialement hospitalisés dans des filières non dédiées. Le faible taux de positivité constaté est en accord avec l’épidémiologie locale correspondant à une zone à faible circulation virale. L’EM a également participé au maintien du lien avec les services et a grandement facilité la diffusion de l’information autour des bonnes pratiques d’hygiène.","Suriray, M.; Dejoies, L.; Ménard, G.; Picard, L.; Arvieux, C.; Donnio, P.",Médecine et Maladies Infectieuses,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0399077X2030367X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0399077X2030367X,495

The new accelerator greatly improved the performance of existing Ion Beam Analysis (IBA) applications (for which we were using since the 1980s an old single-ended Van de Graaff accelerator) and in addition allowed to start a novel activity of Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS), in particular for (14)C dating. Switching between IBA and AMS operation became very easy and fast, which allowed us high flexibility in programming the activities, mainly focused on studies of cultural heritage and atmospheric aerosol composition, but including also applications to biology, geology, material science and forensics, ion implantation, tests of radiation damage to components, detector performance tests and low-energy nuclear physics.

In this study, molecular docking is utilized to test some previously approved drugs against the SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein 15 (Nsp15). We screened 23 drugs, from which three (saquinavir, valrubicin and aprepitant) show a paramount predicted binding affinity (-9.1, -9.6 and -9.2 kcal/mol, respectively) against SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15. Moreover, saquinavir and aprepitant make nonbonded interactions with Leu201 in the active site cavity of Nsp15, while the drug valrubicin interacts with Arg199 and Leu201. This binding pattern may be effective against the targeted protein, leading to Nsp15 blockage and virus abolition. Additionally, the pharmacological properties of the screened drugs are known since they have been approved against different viruses.","Mahmud, Shafi; Elfiky, Abdo A; Amin, Al; Mohanto, Sumon Chandro; Rahman, Ekhtiar; Acharjee, Uzzal Kumar; Saleh, Abu",Future Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34290822/; https://doi.org/10.2217/fvl-2020-0233,495
686164,The path ahead: From global pandemic to health promotion,2020-12-08,"BACKGROUND: The restrictions associated with the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in changes to young children’s daily routines and habits. The impact on their participation in movement behaviours (physical activity, sedentary screen time and sleep) is unknown. This international longitudinal study compared young children’s movement behaviours before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Parents of children aged 3–5 years, from 14 countries (8 low- and middle-income countries, LMICs) completed surveys to assess changes in movement behaviours and how these changes were associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Surveys were completed in the 12 months up to March 2020 and again between May and June 2020 (at the height of restrictions). Physical activity (PA), sedentary screen time (SST) and sleep were assessed via parent survey. At Time 2, COVID-19 factors including level of restriction, environmental conditions, and parental stress were measured. Compliance with the World Health Organizations (WHO) Global guidelines for PA (180 min/day [≥60 min moderate- vigorous PA]), SST (≤1 h/day) and sleep (10-13 h/day) for children under 5 years of age, was determined. RESULTS: Nine hundred- forty-eight parents completed the survey at both time points. Children from LMICs were more likely to meet the PA (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AdjOR] = 2.0, 95%Confidence Interval [CI] 1.0,3.8) and SST (AdjOR = 2.2, 95%CI 1.2,3.9) guidelines than their high-income country (HIC) counterparts. Children who could go outside during COVID-19 were more likely to meet all WHO Global guidelines (AdjOR = 3.3, 95%CI 1.1,9.8) than those who were not. Children of parents with higher compared to lower stress were less likely to meet all three guidelines (AdjOR = 0.5, 95%CI 0.3,0.9). CONCLUSION: PA and SST levels of children from LMICs have been less impacted by COVID-19 than in HICs. Ensuring children can access an outdoor space, and supporting parents’ mental health are important prerequisites for enabling pre-schoolers to practice healthy movement behaviours and meet the Global guidelines.

N protein N-terminal domain (N-NTD) interacts and melts the double stranded transcriptional regulatory sequences (dsTRS), regulating the discontinuous subgenome transcription process. Here, we used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the binding of SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD to non-specific (NS) and TRS dsRNAs. We probed dsRNAs’ Watson and Crick (WC) base-pairing over 25 replicas of 100 ns MD simulations, showing that only one N-NTD of dimeric N is enough to destabilize dsRNAs, triggering melting initiation. dsRNA destabilization driven by N-NTD was more efficient for dsTRS than dsNS. N-NTD dynamics, especially a tweezer-like motion of β2-β3 and α2-β5 loops, seems to play a key role in WC base-pairing destabilization. Based on experimental information available in the literature, we constructed kinetics models for N-NTD-mediated dsRNA melting. Our results support a 1:1 stoichiometry (N-NTD:dsRNA), matching MD simulations and raising different possibilities for N-NTD action: (i) two N-NTD arms of dimeric N would bind to two different RNA sites, either closely or spatially spaced in the viral genome, in a cooperative manner; (ii) monomeric N-NTD would be active, opening up the possibility of a regulatory dissociation event.","Caruso, Ícaro P.; Sanches, Karoline; Da Poian, Andrea T.; Pinheiro, Anderson S.; Almeida, Fabio C.L.",Biophys J,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006349521004884; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349521004884?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34197802/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2021.06.003,495

A lack of cost-effective, reproducible models for the study of M. haemolytica pathogenesis has hampered efforts to better understand the molecular interactions governing disease progression. We employed a highly optimised ovine tracheal epithelial cell model to assess the colonisation of various pathogenic and non-pathogenic M. haemolytica isolates of bovine and ovine origin. Comparison of single representative pathogenic and non-pathogenic ovine isolates over ten time-points by enumeration of tissue-associated bacteria, histology, immunofluorescence microscopy and scanning electron microscopy revealed temporal differences in adhesion, proliferation, bacterial cell physiology and host cell responses. Comparison of eight isolates of bovine and ovine origin at three key time-points (2 h, 48 h and 72 h), revealed that colonisation was not strictly pathogen or serotype specific, with isolates of serotype A1, A2, A6 and A12 being capable of colonising the cell layer regardless of host species or disease status of the host. A trend towards increased proliferative capacity by pathogenic ovine isolates was observed. These results indicate that the host-specific nature of M. haemolytica infection may result at least partially from the colonisation-related processes of adhesion, invasion and proliferation at the epithelial interface.","O’Boyle, Nicky; Berry, Catherine C.; Davies, Robert L.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32917945/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-71604-8,495

METHODS: In our intensive care unit (ICU), 55 patients (46 male, median age 61 years) with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 (35 = 63.6% on mechanical ventilation, 7 = 14.5% on high-flow nasal oxygen, 12 = 20% on non-invasive ventilation, 1 = 1.8% without respiratory support) were treated with high-titre CP (200 mL per dose, range 1–6 doses, median 3 doses per patient, minimum titre > 1:100, Wantai test). 139 COVID-19 patients treated in the same ICU who did not receive CP served as control group. In 27 patients, the effect of CP on the individual levels of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies was assessed by ELISA in serum sample pairs collected before and after CP transfusion. RESULTS: The first CP dose was administered at a median of 8 days after symptom onset. 13 patients in the plasma cohort died (28-day mortality 24.1%), compared to 42 (30.2%) in the cohort who did not receive CP (p = 0.5, Pearson Chi-squared test). Out of the 27 individuals investigated for the presence of IgG antibodies, 8 did not have detectable IgG levels before the first CP transfusion. In this subpopulation, 3 patients (37.5%) died. Not a single confirmed adverse reaction to CP was noted. CONCLUSIONS: While adjunctive treatment with CP for severe and life-threatening COVID-19 was a very safe intervention, we did not observe any effect on mortality.","Hoepler, Wolfgang Paul; Weidner, Lisa; Traugott, Marianna Theresia; Neuhold, Stephanie; Meyer, Elias Laurin; Zoufaly, Alexander; Seitz, Tamara; Kitzberger, Reinhard; Baumgartner, Sebastian; Pawelka, Erich; Karolyi, Mario; Grieb, Alexander; Hind, Julian; Laferl, Hermann; Friese, Emanuela; Wenisch, Christoph; Aberle, Stephan Walter; Aberle, Judith Helene; Weseslindtner, Lukas; Jungbauer, Christoph",Infectious diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34128763/; https://doi.org/10.1080/23744235.2021.1940271,495
688713,Elective orthopedic surgery during COVID-19,2021-02-15,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a novel human illness caused by a previously unrecognized coronavirus (CoV) termed SARS‐CoV. There are conflicting reports on the animal reservoir of SARS‐CoV. Many of the groups that argue carnivores are the original reservoir of SARS‐CoV use a phylogeny to support their argument. However, the phylogenies in these studies often lack outgroup and rooting criteria necessary to determine the origins of SARS‐CoV. Recently, SARS‐CoV has been isolated from various species of Chiroptera from China (e.g., Rhinolophus sinicus) thus leading to reconsideration of the original reservoir of SARS‐CoV. We evaluated the hypothesis that SARS‐CoV isolated from Chiroptera are the original zoonotic source for SARS‐CoV by sampling SARS‐CoV and non‐SARS‐CoV from diverse hosts including Chiroptera, as well as carnivores, artiodactyls, rodents, birds and humans. Regardless of alignment parameters, optimality criteria, or isolate sampling, the resulting phylogenies clearly show that the SARS‐CoV was transmitted to small carnivores well after the epidemic of SARS in humans that began in late 2002. The SARS‐CoV isolates from small carnivores in Shenzhen markets form a terminal clade that emerged recently from within the radiation of human SARS‐CoV. There is evidence of subsequent exchange of SARS‐CoV between humans and carnivores. In addition SARS‐CoV was transmitted independently from humans to farmed pigs (Sus scrofa). The position of SARS‐CoV isolates from Chiroptera are basal to the SARS‐CoV clade isolated from humans and carnivores. Although sequence data indicate that Chiroptera are a good candidate for the original reservoir of SARS‐CoV, the structural biology of the spike protein of SARS‐CoV isolated from Chiroptera suggests that these viruses are not able to interact with the human variant of the receptor of SARS‐CoV, angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). In SARS‐CoV we study, both visually and statistically, labile genomic fragments and, putative key mutations of the spike protein that may be associated with host shifts. We display host shifts and candidate mutations on trees projected in virtual globes depicting the spread of SARS‐CoV. These results suggest that more sampling of coronaviruses from diverse hosts, especially Chiroptera, carnivores and primates, will be required to understand the genomic and biochemical evolution of coronaviruses, including SARS‐CoV. © The Willi Hennig Society 2008.","Janies, Daniel; Habib, Farhat; Alexandrov, Boyan; Hill, Andrew; Pol, Diego",Cladistics,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1096-0031.2008.00199.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32313363/,495
688843,Sero-epidemiology of human coronaviruses in three rural communities in Ghana,2021-03-08,"BACKGROUND: In response to COVID-19, there has been increasing momentum in telehealth development and delivery. To assess the anticipated exponential growth in telehealth, it is important to accurately capture how telehealth has been used in specific mental health fields prior to the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aimed to highlight how telehealth has been used with clinical samples in the neurodevelopmental field, including patients with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), their families, and health care professionals. To identify which technologies show the greatest potential for implementation into health services, we evaluated technologies for effectiveness, economic impact, and readiness for clinical adoption. METHODS: A systematic search of literature was undertaken in April 2018 and updated until December 2019, by using the Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL Plus, EMBASE, and PsycInfo databases. Extracted data included the type of technology, how the technology was used (ie, assessment, treatment, and monitoring), participant characteristics, reported outcomes and authors’ views on clinical effectiveness, user impact (ie, feasibility and acceptability), economic impact, and readiness for clinic adoption. A quality review of the research was performed in accordance with the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine Levels of Evidence. RESULTS: A total of 42 studies met the inclusion criteria. These studies included participants and family members with autism spectrum disorders (21/42, 50%), attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (8/42, 19%), attention deficit hyperactivity or autism spectrum disorders (3/42, 7%), communication disorders (7/42, 17%), and tic disorders (2/42, 5%). The focus of most studies (33/42, 79%) was on treatment, rather than assessment (4/42, 10%) or monitoring (5/42, 12%). Telehealth services demonstrated promise for being clinically effective, predominantly in relation to diagnosing and monitoring NDDs. In terms of NDD treatment, telehealth services were usually equivalent to control groups. There was some evidence of positive user and economic impacts, including increased service delivery efficiency (eg, increased treatment availability and decreased waiting times). However, these factors were not widely recorded across the studies. Telehealth was demonstrated to be cost-effective in the few studies that considered cost-effectiveness. Study quality varied, as many studies had small sample sizes and inadequate control groups. Of the 42 studies, only 11 (26%) were randomized controlled trials, 12 (29%) were case studies or case series, 6 (14%) were qualitative studies, and 5 (12%) were noncomparative trials. CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth has the potential to increase treatment availability, decrease diagnosis waiting times, and aid in NDD monitoring. Further research with more robust and adequately powered study designs that consider cost-effectiveness and increased efficiency is needed. This systematic review highlights the extent of telehealth technology use prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and the movement for investing in remote access to treatments.

Novel therapies are urgently needed. Janus kinase-inhibitors and Type I interferons have emerged as potential antiviral candidates for COVID-19 patients for their proven efficacy against diseases with excessive cytokine release and due to direct antiviral ability against viruses including coronaviruses, respectively. We conducted a systemic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of Janus kinase-inhibitors and Type I interferons and their ability to produce positive patient outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Methods A search of MEDLINE and MedRxiv was conducted by three investigators from inception until July 30 th 2020, including any study type that compared treatment outcomes of humans treated with JAK-inhibitor or Type I interferon against controls. Inclusion necessitated data with clearly indicated risk estimates or those that permitted their back-calculation. Outcomes were synthesized using RevMan. Results Of 733 searched studies, we included four randomized and eleven non-randomized trials. Five of the studies were unpublished. Those who received Janus kinase-inhibitor had significantly reduced odds of mortality (OR, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.03 – 0.39, p<0.001) and ICU admission (OR, 0.05; 95% CI, 0.01 – 0.26, p<0.001), and had significantly increased odds of hospital discharge (OR, 22.76; 95% CI, 10.68 – 48.54, p<0.00001), when compared to standard treatment group. Type I interferon recipients had significantly reduced odds of mortality (OR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.04 – 0.85, p<0.05), and increased odds of discharge bordering significance (OR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.00 – 3.59, p=0.05). Conclusions Janus kinase-inhibitor treatment is significantly associated with positive clinical outcomes in terms of mortality, ICU admission, and discharge. Type I interferon treatment is associated with positive clinical outcomes in regard to mortality and discharge. While these data show promise, additional well-conducted RCTs are needed to further elucidate the relationship between clinical outcomes and Janus kinase-inhibitors and Type I interferons in COVID-19 patients.","Walz, Lucas; Cohen, Avi J.; Rebaza, Andre P.; Vanchieri, James; Slade, Martin D.; Cruz, Charles S.

To elucidate the evolution of MERS-CoV-related viruses and their interspecies transmission pathway, samples were collected from different mammals in China. A novel coronavirus related to MERS-CoV, Erinaceus amurensis hedgehog coronavirus HKU31 (Ea-HedCoV HKU31), was identified from two Amur hedgehogs. Genome analysis supported that Ea-HedCoV HKU31 represents a novel species under Merbecovirus, being most closely related to Erinaceus CoV from European hedgehogs in Germany, with 79.6% genome sequence identity. Compared to other members of Merbecovirus, Ea-HedCoV HKU31 possessed unique non-structural proteins and putative cleavage sites at ORF1ab. Phylogenetic analysis showed that Ea-HedCoV HKU31 and BetaCoV Erinaceus/VMC/DEU/2012 were closely related to NeoCoV and BatCoV PREDICT from African bats in the spike region, suggesting that the latter bat viruses have arisen from recombination between CoVs from hedgehogs and bats. The predicted HKU31 receptor-binding domain (RBD) possessed only one out of 12 critical amino acid residues for binding to human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4), the MERS-CoV receptor. The structural modeling of the HKU31-RBD-hDPP4 binding interphase compared to that of MERS-CoV and Tylonycteris bat CoV HKU4 (Ty-BatCoV HKU4) suggested that HKU31-RBD is unlikely to bind to hDPP4. Our findings support that hedgehogs are an important reservoir of Merbecovirus, with evidence of recombination with viruses from bats. Further investigations in bats, hedgehogs and related animals are warranted to understand the evolution of MERS-CoV-related viruses.","Lau, Susanna K. P.; Luk, Hayes K. H.; Wong, Antonio C.
