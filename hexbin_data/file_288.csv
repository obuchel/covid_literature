1353,Characterization of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 Ectodomain Shedding from Mouse Proximal Tubular Cells,2014-01-15,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is highly expressed in the kidney proximal tubule, where it cleaves angiotensin (Ang) II to Ang-(1-7). Urinary ACE2 levels increase in diabetes, suggesting that ACE2 may be shed from tubular cells. The aim of this study was to determine if ACE2 is shed from proximal tubular cells, to characterize ACE2 fragments, and to study pathways for shedding. Studies involved primary cultures of mouse proximal tubular cells, with ACE2 activity measured using a synthetic substrate, and analysis of ACE2 fragments by immunoblots and mass spectrometry. The culture media from mouse proximal tubular cells demonstrated a time-dependent increase in ACE2 activity, suggesting constitutive ACE2 shedding. ACE2 was detected in media as two bands at ∼90 kDa and ∼70 kDa on immunoblots. By contrast, full-length ACE2 appeared at ∼100 kDa in cell lysates or mouse kidney cortex. Mass spectrometry of the two deglycosylated fragments identified peptides matching mouse ACE2 at positions 18-706 and 18-577, respectively. The C-terminus of the 18-706 peptide fragment contained a non-tryptic site, suggesting that Met(706) is a candidate ACE2 cleavage site. Incubation of cells in high D-glucose (25 mM) (and to a lesser extent Ang II) for 48–72 h increased ACE2 activity in the media (p<0.001), an effect blocked by inhibition of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM)17. High D-glucose increased ADAM17 activity in cell lysates (p<0.05). These data indicate that two glycosylated ACE2 fragments are constitutively shed from mouse proximal tubular cells. ACE2 shedding is stimulated by high D-glucose, at least partly via an ADAM17-mediated pathway. The results suggest that proximal tubular shedding of ACE2 may increase in diabetes, which could enhance degradation of Ang II in the tubular lumen, and increase levels of Ang-(1-7).","Xiao, Fengxia; Zimpelmann, Joseph; Agaybi, Samih; Gurley, Susan B.; Puente, Lawrence; Burns, Kevin D.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3893316/,288
1825,Prevalence and Incidence of Respiratory Syncytial Virus and Other Respiratory Viral Infections in Children Aged 6 Months to 10 Years With Influenza-like Illness Enrolled in a Randomized Trial,2015-06-01,"Background. The high burden of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-associated morbidity and mortality makes vaccine development a priority. Methods. As part of an efficacy trial of pandemic influenza vaccines (NCT01051661), RSV epidemiology in healthy children aged 6 months to <10 years at first vaccination with influenza-like illness (ILI) was evaluated in Australia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand between February 2010 and August 2011. Active surveillance for ILI was conducted for approximately 1 year, with nasal and throat swabs analyzed by polymerase chain reaction. The prevalence and incidence of RSV among ILI episodes were calculated. Results. A total of 6266 children were included, of whom 2421 experienced 3717 ILI episodes with a respiratory sample available. RSV was detected for 359 ILI episodes, a prevalence of 9.7% (95% confidence interval: 8.7–10.7). The highest prevalence was in children aged 12–23 or 24–35 months in all countries except the Philippines, where it was in children aged 6–11 months. The incidence of RSV-associated ILI was 7.0 (6.3–7.7) per 100 person-years (PY). Eighty-eight ILI episodes resulted in hospitalization, of which 8 were associated with RSV (prevalence 9.1% [4.0–17.1]; incidence 0.2 [0.1–0.3] per 100 PY). The incidence of RSV-associated ILI resulting in medical attendance was 6.0 (5.4–6.7) per 100 PY. RSV B subtypes were observed more frequently than A subtypes. Conclusions. Active surveillance demonstrated the considerable burden of RSV-associated illness that would not be identified through hospital-based surveillance, with a substantial part of the burden occurring in older infants and children.","Nolan, Terry; Borja-Tabora, Charissa; Lopez, Pio; Weckx, Lily; Ulloa-Gutierrez, Rolando; Lazcano-Ponce, Eduardo; Kerdpanich, Angkool; Weber, Miguel Angel Rodriguez; Mascareñas de Los Santos, Abiel; Tinoco, Juan-Carlos; Safadi, Marco Aurelio P.; Seng, Lim Fong; Hernandez-de Mezerville, Marcela; Faingezicht, Idis; Cruz-Valdez, Aurelio; Feng, Yang; Li, Ping; Durviaux, Serge; Haars, Gerco; Roy-Ghanta, Sumita; Vaughn, David W.; Taylor, Sylvia",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4429758/,288
1851,Surveillance of Acute Respiratory Infections Using Community-Submitted Symptoms and Specimens for Molecular Diagnostic Testing,2015-05-27,"Participatory systems for surveillance of acute respiratory infection give real-time information about infections circulating in the community, yet to-date are limited to self-reported syndromic information only and lacking methods of linking symptom reports to infection types. We developed the GoViral platform to evaluate whether a cohort of lay volunteers could, and would find it useful to, contribute self-reported symptoms online and to compare specimen types for self-collected diagnostic information of sufficient quality for respiratory infection surveillance. Volunteers were recruited, given a kit (collection materials and customized instructions), instructed to report their symptoms weekly, and when sick with cold or flu-like symptoms, requested to collect specimens (saliva and nasal swab). We compared specimen types for respiratory virus detection sensitivity (via polymerase-chain-reaction) and ease of collection. Participants were surveyed to determine receptivity to participating when sick, to receiving information on the type of pathogen causing their infection and types circulating near them. Between December 1 2013 and March 1 2014, 295 participants enrolled in the study and received a kit. Of those who reported symptoms, half (71) collected and sent specimens for analysis. Participants submitted kits on average 2.30 days (95 CI: 1.65 to 2.96) after symptoms began. We found good concordance between nasal and saliva specimens for multiple pathogens, with few discrepancies. Individuals report that saliva collection is easiest and report that receiving information about what pathogen they, and those near them, have is valued and can shape public health behaviors. Community-submitted specimens can be used for the detection of acute respiratory infection with individuals showing receptivity for participating and interest in a real-time picture of respiratory pathogens near them.","Goff, Jennifer; Rowe, Aaron; Brownstein, John S.; Chunara, Rumi",PLoS Curr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4455990/,288
2257,Protein Kinase C-δ Mediates Shedding of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 from Proximal Tubular Cells,2016-06-01,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) degrades angiotensin (Ang) II to Ang-(1–7), and protects against diabetic renal injury. Soluble ACE2 fragments are shed from the proximal tubule, and appear at high levels in the urine with diabetes. High glucose-induced shedding of ACE2 from proximal tubular cells is mediated by the enzyme “a disintegrin and metalloproteinase-17″ (ADAM17). Here, we investigated the mechanism for constitutive shedding of ACE2. Mouse proximal tubular cells were cultured and ACE2 shedding into the media was assessed by enzyme activity assay and immunoblot analysis. Cells were incubated with pharmacologic inhibitors, or transfected with silencing (si) RNA. Incubation of proximal tubular cells with increasing concentrations of D-glucose stimulated ACE2 shedding, which peaked at 16 mM, while L-glucose (osmotic control) had no effect on shedding. In cells maintained in 7.8 mM D-glucose, ACE2 shedding was significantly inhibited by the pan-protein kinase C (PKC) competitive inhibitor sotrastaurin, but not by an inhibitor of ADAM17. Incubation of cells with the PKC-α and -β1-specific inhibitor Go6976, the PKC β1 and β2-specific inhibitor ruboxistaurin, inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases-2,-8, and -9, or an inhibitor of ADAM10 (GI250423X) had no effect on basal ACE2 shedding. By contrast, the PKC-δ inhibitor rottlerin significantly inhibited both constitutive and high glucose-induced ACE2 shedding. Transfection of cells with siRNA directed against PKC-δ reduced ACE2 shedding by 20%, while knockdown of PKC-ε was without effect. These results indicate that constitutive shedding of ACE2 from proximal tubular cells is mediated by PKC-δ, which is also linked to high glucose-induced shedding. Targeting PKC-δ may preserve membrane-bound ACE2 in proximal tubule in disease states and diminish Ang II-stimulated adverse signaling.","Xiao, Fengxia; Zimpelmann, Joseph; Burger, Dylan; Kennedy, Christopher; Hébert, Richard L.; Burns, Kevin D.",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4887483/,288
2503,Comparison of the first three waves of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus circulation in the mainland of the People’s Republic of China,2016-12-05,"BACKGROUND: H7N9 human cases were first detected in mainland China in March 2013. Circulation of this virus has continued each year shifting to typical winter months. We compared the clinical and epidemiologic characteristics for the first three waves of virus circulation. METHODS: The first wave was defined as reported cases with onset dates between March 31-September 30, 2013, the second wave was defined as October 1, 2013-September 30, 2014 and the third wave was defined as October 1, 2014-September 30, 2015. We used simple descriptive statistics to compare characteristics of the three distinct waves of virus circulation. RESULTS: In mainland China, 134 cases, 306 cases and 219 cases were detected and reported in first three waves, respectively. The median age of cases was statistically significantly older in the first wave (61 years vs. 56 years, 56 years, p < 0.001) compared to the following two waves. Most reported cases were among men in all three waves. There was no statistically significant difference between case fatality proportions (33, 42 and 45%, respectively, p = 0.08). There were no significant statistical differences for time from illness onset to first seeking healthcare, hospitalization, lab confirmation, initiation antiviral treatment and death between the three waves. A similar percentage of cases in all waves reported exposure to poultry or live poultry markets (87%, 88%, 90%, respectively). There was no statistically significant difference in the occurrence of severe disease between the each of the first three waves of virus circulation. Twenty-one clusters were reported during these three waves (4, 11 and 6 clusters, respectively), of which, 14 were considered to be possible human-to-human transmission. CONCLUSION: Though our case investigation for the first three waves found few differences between the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics, there is continued international concern about the pandemic potential of this virus. Since the virus continues to circulate, causes more severe disease, has the ability to mutate and become transmissible from human-to-human, and there is limited natural protection from infection in communities, it is critical that surveillance systems in China and elsewhere are alert to the influenza H7N9 virus.","Xiang, Nijuan; Iuliano, A.

3096,The Hemagglutinin A Stem Antibody MEDI8852 Prevents and Controls Disease and Limits Transmission of Pandemic Influenza Viruses,2017-08-01,"BACKGROUND: MEDI8852 is a novel monoclonal antibody (mAb) that neutralizes both group I and group II influenza A viruses (IAVs) in vitro. We evaluated whether MEDI8852 was effective for prophylaxis and therapy against representative group I (H5N1) and group II (H7N9) pandemic IAVs in mice and ferrets and could be used to block transmission of influenza H1N1pdm09 in ferrets, compared to an irrelevant control mAb R347 and oseltamivir. METHODS: MEDI8852 was administered to mice and ferrets by intraperitoneal injection at varying doses, 24 hours prior to intranasal infection with H5N1 and H7N9 viruses for prophylaxis, and 24, 48, and 72 hours post-infection for treatment. A comparison with oseltamivir alone and combination of MEDI8852 and oseltamivir was included in some studies. Survival, weight loss, and viral titers were assessed over a 14-day study period. For the transmission study, naive respiratory contact ferrets received MEDI8852 or R347 prior to exposure to ferrets infected with an H1N1pdm09 virus. RESULTS: MEDI8852 was effective for prophylaxis and treatment of H7N9 and H5N1 infection in mice, with a clear dose-dependent response and treatment with MEDI8852 24, 48, or 72 hours postinfection was superior to oseltamivir for H5N1. MEDI8852 alone was effective treatment for lethal H5N1 infection in ferrets compared to oseltamivir and R347, and MEDI8852 plus oseltamivir was better than oseltamivir alone. MEDI8852 or oseltamivir alone early in infection was equally effective for H7N9 infection in ferrets while the combination yielded similar protection when treatment was delayed. MEDI8852 was able to protect naive ferrets from airborne transmission of H1N1pdm09. CONCLUSIONS: MEDI8852, alone or with oseltamivir, shows promise for prophylaxis or therapy of group I and II IAVs with pandemic potential. Additionally, MEDI8852 blocked influenza transmission in ferrets, a unique finding among influenza-specific mAbs.","Paules, Catharine I; Lakdawala, Seema; McAuliffe, Josephine M; Paskel, Myeisha; Vogel, Leatrice; Kallewaard, Nicole L; Zhu, Qing; Subbarao, Kanta",J Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5853468/,288
3846,"Severe Acute Respiratory Infections With Influenza and Noninfluenza Respiratory Viruses: Yemen, 2011-2016",2019-05-29,"In 2010, Yemen started the surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARIs) by establishing 2 sentinel sites in Sana’a and Aden city. This study aims to determine the proportions of influenza and noninfluenza viruses among SARI patients and to determine the severity of SARI and its associated factors. The data of SARI patients who were admitted to SARI surveillance sites at Al Johory hospital in Sana’a and Al Wahdah hospital in Aden city during the period 2011-2016 were analyzed. The proportions of positive influenza viruses (type A, B) and noninfluenza viruses (respiratory syncytial, adenovirus, human parainfluenza, and human metapneumovirus), intensive care unit (ICU) admission rate, and fatality rate among SARI patients were calculated. A total of 1811 of SARI patients were admitted during 2011-2016. Of those, 78% were <15 years old. A total of 89 (5%) patients had influenza viruses and 655 (36%) had noninfluenza viruses. The overall ICU admission rate was 40% and the case-fatality rate was 8%. Infection by influenza type (A, B) and mixed (adenovirus, human parainfluenza) was significantly associated with lower ICU admission. Age <15 years old, infection with influenza B, pre-existence of chronic diseases, and admission to Aden site were significantly associated with higher fatality rate among patients. In conclusion; SARI patients in Yemen had a high ICU admission and case-fatality rates. Influenza type B, chronic diseases, and admission to Aden site are associated with higher fatality rate. Expanding surveillance sites and panel of laboratory tests to involve other pathogens will help to provide accurate diagnosis for SARI etiology and give more comprehensive picture. Training staff for SARI case management will help to reduce severe outcomes.","Al Amad, Mohammad Abdullah; Al Mahaqri, Ali Ali; Al Serouri, Abdulwahed Abdulgabar; Khader, Yousef S.",Inquiry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6542124/,288
6361,Crimean–Congo haemorrhagic fever: transmission to visitors and healthcare workers,2016-07-06,"No formal system exists to review trade restrictions imposed during international public health emergencies rapidly. Failure to put one in place creates disincentives for surveillance and reporting, thereby undermining protection efforts. The 2003 SARS outbreak exposed weaknesses in global governance that caused uncoordinated public health and economic responses. New International Health Regulations (IHR), applied first during the 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak, demonstrated improvement. Yet they failed to allow for management of public health emergencies in a way that balanced threats to health and those to economies and trade. Establishment of a joint WHO–WTO committee to adjudicate these conflicts might better achieve that balance.","Mackey, Tim K; Liang, Bryan A",J Public Health Policy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7100248/,288
7171,Genotypes Coding for Mannose-Binding Lectin Deficiency Correlated With Cryptococcal Meningitis in HIV-Uninfected Chinese Patients,2011-06-01,"Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV) are closely related, recently emerged paramyxoviruses that are capable of causing considerable morbidity and mortality in several mammalian species, including humans. Henipavirus-specific vaccines are still commercially unavailable, and development of novel antiviral strategies to prevent lethal infections due to henipaviruses is highly desirable. Here we describe the development of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vaccines expressing the NiV G protein. Characterization of these vaccines in mice demonstrated that a single intramuscular AAV injection was sufficient to induce a potent and long-lasting antibody response. Translational studies in hamsters further demonstrated that all vaccinated animals were protected against lethal challenge with NiV. In addition, this vaccine induced a cross-protective immune response that was able to protect 50% of the animals against a challenge by HeV. This study presents a new efficient vaccination strategy against henipaviruses and opens novel perspectives on the use of AAV vectors as vaccines against emergent diseases.","Ploquin, Aurélie; Szécsi, Judit; Mathieu, Cyrille; Guillaume, Vanessa; Barateau, Véronique; Ong, Kien Chai; Wong, Kum Thong; Cosset, François-Loïc; Horvat, Branka; Salvetti, Anna",J Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107322/,288

7232,Severe Illnesses Associated With Outbreaks of Respiratory Syncytial Virus and Influenza in Adults,2020-03-01,"BACKGROUND: Respiratory tract infections are often viral and but are frequently treated with antibiotics, providing a significant opportunity for antibiotic de-escalation in patients. We sought to determine whether an automated electronic medical record best practice alert (BPA) based on procalcitonin and respiratory polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results could help reduce inappropriate antibiotic use in patients with likely viral respiratory illness. METHODS: This multisite, pre–post, quasi-experimental study included patients 18 years and older with a procalcitonin level <0.25 ng/mL and a virus identified on respiratory PCR within 48 hours of each other, and 1 or more systemic antibiotics ordered. In the study group, a BPA alerted providers of the diagnostic results suggesting viral infection and prompted them to reassess the need for antibiotics. The primary outcome measured was total antibiotic-days of therapy. RESULTS: The BPA reduced inpatient antibiotic-days of therapy by a mean of 2.2 days compared with patients who met criteria but did not have the alert fire (8.0 vs 5.8 days, respectively, P < .001). The BPA also reduced the percentage of patients prescribed antibiotics on discharge (20% vs 47.8%, P < .001), whereas there was no difference in need for antibiotic escalation after initial discontinuation (7.6% vs 4.3%, P = .198). CONCLUSIONS: The automated antimicrobial stewardship BPA effectively reduced antibiotic use and discharge prescribing rates when diagnostics suggested viral respiratory tract infection, without a higher rate for reinitiation of antibiotics after discontinuation.","Moradi, Tony; Bennett, Nicholas; Shemanski, Shelby; Kennedy, Kevin; Schlachter, Andrew; Boyd, Sarah",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108168/,288

7352,Membrane-Disruptive Effect of Human Milk: Inactivation of Enveloped Viruses,1986-12-11,"Background. Human bocavirus (HBoV) was recently described as a new member of the Parvoviridae family, and its possible association with respiratory illness in infants has been discussed. To date, HBoV genomes have been detected worldwide in respiratory tract samples obtained from children with pulmonary diseases, whereas only limited data on virus-specific immunity are available, mainly because of the lack of recombinant viral antigens. Methods. HBoV viruslike particles (VLPs) were produced in insect cells and characterized by electron microscopy and cesium chloride gradient centrifugation. HBoV viral protein 2 (VP2)-specific antibodies and CD4(+) T helper cell responses were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunsorbent assay and enzyme-linked immunospot assay. Results. VP2 capsid proteins of HBoV were produced in insect cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus, and the formation of icosahedral VLPs (diameter, 21–25 nm; sedimentation density, 1.33 g/cm(3)) was demonstrated. A significant increase in secretion of VP2-specific interferon-γ was detected in cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from 69 healthy adults found to be positive for HBoV-specific immunoglobulin G antibodies, compared with control stimulations. In parallel, T cell responses against identically expressed parvovirus B19 VP2 VLPs were frequently observed in the individuals studied, without there being obvious cross-reactions between HBoV and parvovirus B19. Conclusions. Data suggest the presence of HBoV-specific immune responses in adults and strongly support a high prevalence of HBoV among humans.","Lindner, Juha; Zehentmeier, Sandra; Franssila, Rauli; Barabas, Sascha; Schroeder, Josef; Deml, Ludwig; Modrow, Susanne",J Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7109795/,288

7402,A Recently Identified Rhinovirus Genotype Is Associated with Severe Respiratory-Tract Infection in Children in Germany,2007-12-15,"Background. PARV4 and human bocavirus (HBoV) are newly discovered human parvoviruses with poorly understood epidemiologies and disease associations. We investigated the frequencies of persistence, tissue distribution, and influence of immunosuppression on replication of these viruses. Methods. At autopsy, bone marrow, lymphoid tissue, and brain tissue from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)—infected individuals with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and those without AIDS and from HIV-uninfected individuals were screened for parvovirus B19, PARV4, and HBoV DNA by means of quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses. Results. B19 DNA was detected both in HIV-infected study subjects (13 of 24) and in HIV-uninfected study subjects (8 of 8), whereas PARV4 DNA was detected only in HIV-infected study subjects (17 of 24). HBoV DNA was not detected in any study subjects. The degree of immunosuppression with HIV infection did not influence B19 or PARV4 viral loads. B19 or PARV4 plasma viremia was not detected in any study subjects (n = 76; viral load <25 DNA copies/mL). A significantly older age distribution was found for study subjects infected with B19 genotype 2, compared with those infected with B19 genotype 1. Two genotypes of PARV4 were detected; study subjects carrying prototype PARV4 (genotype 1) were younger (all born after 1958) than those infected with genotype 2 (PARV5; study subjects born between 1949 and 1956). Conclusions. Tight immune control of replication of B19 and PARV4 was retained despite profound immunosuppression. Recent genotype replacement of PARV4, combined with absent sequence diversity among genotype 1 sequences, suggests a recent, epidemic spread in the United Kingdom, potentially through transmission routes shared by HIV.","Manning, Ashleigh; Willey, Samantha J.; Bell, Jeanne E.; Simmonds, Peter",J Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7109978/,288
7405,"Comparison of Tissue Distribution, Persistence, and Molecular Epidemiology of Parvovirus B19 and Novel Human Parvoviruses PARV4 and Human Bocavirus",2007-05-01,"The presence and nature of interpeptide disulfide bonds in HANA (Aemagglutinin and neura-minidase) glycoprotein and F (fusion) glycoprotein of HVJ (Sendai virus) are described. In the case of HANA, subunits of the same or very similar molecular weight were inter connected with a disulfide bond(s). Cleavage of the bond(s) can easily be achieved by the addition of 1 mM dithiothreitol with concomitant loss of the biological activities of the glyco-protein. After splitting of the interconnecting bonds, all the HANA protein subunits remained bound on the viral membrane. To observe the cleavage of the interpeptide disulfide bond between the F(1) and F(2) subunits of F glycoprotein, higher concentrations of sulfhydryl compounds were required than were necessary for HANA protein. Splitting of the disulfide bond under either denaturing or non-denaturing conditions failed to release both segments of F protein from the virion. Therefore, F glycoprotein seems to have at least two membrane binding sites, one on F(1) and the other on F(2). On the other hand, the disulfide bond which connects the HA(1) and HA(2) subunits of influenza virus is hardly cleaved under non-denaturing conditions. Addition of 8 M urea or 6 M guanidine HCl, which completely inactivates HA activity, was necessary for the splitting of this disulfide bond by thiol compounds. Interestingly, the HA(1) submit was released from the virion after the cleavage. Thus, unlike F(1) and F(2) of HVJ, the HA(1) subunit seems to have no hydrophobic binding site to the membrane. A model for the arrangement of these subunits on the viral membrane is proposed.","OZAWA, Masayuki; ASANO, Akira; OKADA, Yoshio",J Biochem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7109996/,288
7449,Inhibition of Rhinovirus Replication In Vitro and In Vivo by Acid-Buffered Saline,2007-04-15,"Alanyl aminopeptidase (AAP) was purified to homogeneity from human seminal plasma. The calculated molecular weight of the purified enzyme was approximately 137,000±5,000 from light scattering, 140,000 (main) and 137,000 (minor) from non-denatured PAGE and 153,000 from SDS-PAGE in the absence or presence of 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME). These findings suggest that the enzyme is monomeric in form in human seminal plasma. The enzyme hydrolyzed several amino acid 4-methyl-coumaryl-7-amide (MCA) substrates. The order of K(cat;)/K(m) values of AAP at optimal pH (pH 7.5) was Ala- >Lys-Ala- ≥ Met- > Leu- > Phe- > Arg- ≥ Arg-Arg- > Lys- > Gly-MCAs. AAP was potently inhibited by bestatin, leuhis-tin, actinonin, amastatin, and 1,10-phenanthroline. These findings suggest that AAP is an aminopeptidase. We determined that the amino acid sequence of the first 22 residues of the enzyme was Ser(1)-Thr-Thr-Pro-Ser(5)-Ala-Ser-Ala-Thr-Thr(10)-Asn-Pro-Ala-Ser-Ala(15)-Thr-Thr-Leu-Asp-Gln(20)-Ser-Lys-. This sequence was completely coincident with that downstream of the transmembrane site of human intestinal alanyl aminopeptidase N (CD13). We also isolated cDNA encoding AAP from human prostate cDNA library, sequenced its structure, and confirmed human seminal plasma AAP to be identical with alanyl aminopeptidase N. We postulated that native human seminal plasma alanyl aminopeptidase is released into the seminal plasma after the specific site is cleaved by elastase or an elastase-like enzyme. The enzyme level in human seminal plasma determined by single radial immunodiffusion was 5.2±3.2mg/100ml (mean±SD, n=20) in individuals 20–47 years of age.

At 8 wk-of-age, Group MF and IF relative weights of bursa of Fabricius (0.57 g/100 g BW; 0.58 g /100 g BW), thymus glands (0.77; 0.78), and areas of Peyer's patches (PP) (2.7 cm(2); 2.9 cm(2)) were higher (P < 0.05) than Controls (bursa, 0.50 g; thymus, 0.70 g; PP area, 1.8 cm(2)). In Experiment 2, 10-wk-old pullets were fed a control diet or diets containing 1.5% MF or IF for 8 wk. At 14 wk-of-age IF pullets had higher (P < 0.05) heterophil phagocytosis efficiency (447.9 beads/100 cells) than Controls (376.4) and MF and IF had greater (P < 0.05) oxidative burst (1,302.9 and 1,857.7 ΔRFU) than Controls (744.1). At 17 wk-of-age MF and IF had increased (P < 0.05) proliferation of T-lymphocytes (ConcanavalinA-stimulated) (100.4 and 103.1% of unstimulated cells) and B-lymphocytes (lipopolysaccharide-stimulated) (122.4 and 129.0) than Controls (ConA, 79.4; lipopolysaccharide, 106.6). At 18 wk-of-age, IF pullets were heavier (1,607.5 g, P < 0.05) than Controls (1,506.5 g), had heavier (P < 0.05) bursa of Fabricius (1.12 g) than MF and Control groups (0.98 g; 0.92 g) and cecal tonsils of MF (0.38 g) and IF (0.39 g) weighted more (P < 0.05) than Controls (0.33 g). Number of jejunal and ileal PP (10.0) in IF pullets was higher (P < 0.05) than Controls (7.1). These results indicate that both MF and IF can improve development of the immune system of young and grower pullets during periods of maturation and involution of lymphoid organs.","Hussein, Sherzad M.; Yokhana, Johnny S.; Frankel, Theresa L.",Poult Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7112000/,288

Five respiratory pathogenic viruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were used as inducers. Cells from every child responded to at least three out of the six inducers by interferon production. As a group, cultures prepared from patient cells showed decreased production of IFN when stimulated with adeno, rhino, corona or RS viruses or with the mycoplasma. Similar trend between the two groups of children was seen as regards influenza A virus induced IFN production in leukocyte cultures. These results corroborate our previous findings that relative deficiency in interferon production appears to be inducer-specific, and suggest that this phenomenon may have a role in the pathogenesis of recurrent respiratory infections.","Pitkäranta, Anne; Karma, Pekka; Hovi, Tapani",Clin Diagn Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134959/,288

12955,Implementation and experiments for interactive lyrics transcreation system,2020-07-30,"BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress and inflammatory pathways are involved in migraine and endogenous antioxidant defense system has a role in the prevention of hyperalgesia in migraine. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the role of the most pharmacologically effective molecules among the fumaric acid esters (FAEs), dimethyl fumarate, nuclear factor E2-related factor 2/antioxidant response element (Nrf-2/ARE) pathway-mediated, in regulating the hypersensitivity in a mouse model of nitroglycerine (NTG)-induced migraine. METHODS: Mice were orally administered with DMF at the doses of 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg, 5 min after NTG intraperitoneal injections. We performed histological and molecular analysis on the whole brain and behavioral tests after 4 h by NTG-migraine induction. The expression of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-кB) subunit p65, nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor alpha (IκBα), inducible nitrite oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), Nrf-2, manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), and heme-oxygenase-1 (HO-1) were detected by Western blot. Tail flick, hot plate, orofacial formalin, and photophobia tests were used to evaluate migraine-like pain and migraine-related light sensitivity. Moreover, we evaluate Nrf-2-dependent mechanism by the in vitro stimulation of cells extracted by trigeminal ganglia with diethylenetriamine/nitric oxide (DETA/NO), a nitric oxide (NO) donor. The cells were pre-treated with DMF and an antagonist of Nrf-2, trigonelline (TR) 2 h before DETA/NO stimulation. RESULTS: DMF treatment notably reduced histological damage as showed by cresyl violet staining; also, regulating both NF-κB and Nrf-2 pathway, DMF treatment decreased the severity of inflammation and increased the protective antioxidant action. Moreover, the headache was significantly reduced. The protective effect of DMF treatment, via Nrf-2, was confirmed in in vitro studies, through inhibition of Nrf-2 by trigonelline. Cytotoxicity, iNOS, and MnSOD expression were evaluated. CONCLUSION: These results provided the evidence that DMF, by Nrf-2 modulation, has a protective effect on central sensitization induced by NTG, suggesting a new insight into the potential application of DMF as novel candidates in drug development for migraine.","Casili, Giovanna; Lanza, Marika; Filippone, Alessia; Campolo, Michela; Paterniti, Irene; Cuzzocrea, Salvatore; Esposito, Emanuela",J Neuroinflammation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7469611/,288
12974,Hepatitis a virus infection in Central-West Tunisia: an age structured model of transmission and vaccination impact,2020-08-26,"BACKGROUND: Excessive inflammation within damaged tissue usually leads to delayed or insufficient regeneration, and nerves in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) generally do not recover fully following damage. Consequently, there is growing interest in whether modulation of the inflammatory response could help to promote nerve regeneration in the PNS. However, to date, there are no practical therapeutic strategies for manipulating inflammation after nerve injury. Thrombomodulin (TM) is a transmembrane glycoprotein containing five domains. The lectin-like domain of TM has the ability to suppress the inflammatory response. However, whether TM can modulate inflammation in the PNS during nerve regeneration has yet to be elucidated. METHODS: We investigated the role of TM in switching proinflammatory type 1 macrophages (M1) to anti-inflammatory type 2 macrophages (M2) in a human monocytic cell line (THP-1) and evaluated the therapeutic application of TM in transected sciatic nerve injury in rats. RESULTS: The administration of TM during M1 induction significantly reduced the expression levels of inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-a (p < 0.05), IL-6 (p < 0.05), and CD86 (p < 0.05), in THP-1 cells. Simultaneously, the expression levels of M2 markers, including IL-10 (p < 0.05) and CD206 (p < 0.05), were significantly increased in TM-treated THP-1 cells. Inhibition of IL-4R-c-Myc-pSTAT6-PPARγ signaling abolished the expression levels of IL-10 (p < 0.05) and CD206 (p < 0.05). The conditioned medium (CM) collected from M1 cells triggered an inflammatory response in primary Schwann cells, while CM collected from M1 cells treated with TM resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in inflammation. TM treatment led to better nerve regeneration when tested 6 weeks after injury and preserved effector muscle function. In addition, TM treatment reduced macrophage infiltration at the site of injury and led to potent M1 to M2 transition, thus indicating the anti-inflammatory capacity of TM. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our findings demonstrate the anti-inflammatory role of TM during nerve regeneration. Therefore, TM represents a potential drug for the promotion and modulation of functional recovery in peripheral nerves that acts by regulating the M1/M2 ratio.","Huang, Tzu-Chieh; Wu, Hua-Lin; Chen, Szu-Han; Wang, Yun-Ting; Wu, Chia-Ching",J Neuroinflammation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7477856/,288

Physical activity is a modifiable factor for obesity, which was reported to be correlated with the built environment. However, the effects of the built environment on physical activity are not consistent. Walkability is a convenient way to assess the built environment. We aim to prospectively explore the relationship among walkability, physical activity and obesity in Chinese participants in Chongqing, a hilly city and provide evidence for future urban planning. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Participants will be recruited from people who receive health examination in the Health Management Centre, the First Affiliated Hospital to Army Medical University. Exposure variables are WalkScores calculated within the areas around workplace and residential addresses of participants. The primary outcomes are body mass index measured through health examination at baseline and follow-ups, and daily walking steps recorded by WeChat mini application for 30 days after every time of health examination. Other health-related data of the participants will also be collected. Multivariate regression analysis will be performed to examine the relationship between exposure variables and outcomes.

14684,Epidemiology and Potential Methods for Prevention of Neonatal Intestinal Viral Infections,1990-05-11,"Viruses may cause immunosuppression by a variety of mechanisms. This review delineates four categories. First, immunosuppression can result from the direct effects of viral replication on lymphocyte functions. Either all classes of lymphocytes can be affected, as occurs in measles, or the effect can be restricted to a cell subtype, as is the case with human T cell-Iymphotropic virus type III. Second, the activity of soluble factors of viral or host origin released from infected cells can affect immunosuppression. A third mechanism results from viral infection of macrophages and affects the function of these cells in natural and acquired immunity. Finally, immunosuppression may result from viral triggering of an imbalance in immune regulation, which culminates in the overactivity of suppressor cells. A detailed knowlege of the mechanisms by which viruses are involved in immunosuppression may help in the design of strategies to reverse the effect.","Rouse, Barry T.; Horohov, David W.",Rev Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7792945/,288

A pseudoknot involves intramolecular pairing of bases in a hairpin loop with bases outside the stem of the loop to form a second stem and loop region. In this study, we propose a method for searching and predicting pseudoknots that are likely to have functional meaning. In our procedure, the orthodox hairpin structure involved in the pseudoknot is required to be both statistically significant and relatively stable to the others in the sequence. The bases outside the stem of the hairpin loop in the predicted pseudoknot are not entangled with any formation of a highly stable secondary structure in the sequence. Also, the predicted pseudoknot is significantly more stable than those that can be formed from a large set of scrambled sequences under the assumption that the energy contribution from a pseudoknot is proportional to the size of second loop region and planar energy contribution from second stem region. A number of functional pseudoknots that have been reported before can be identified and predicted from their sequences by our method.","Chen, Jih-H.; Le, Shu-Yun; Maizel, Jacob V.",Comput Appl Biosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7793008/,288

If the stockpile would be used in relation to the recent pandemic alert, an investment decision about renewing the stock for a possible subsequent pandemic is essential. The decision should include cost-effectiveness considerations. Methods: We constructed a cost-effectiveness analysis in the Dutch context, explicitly including risk of an outbreak. Outcomes from a dynamic transmission model, comparing an intervention with a non-intervention scenario, were input in our health economic calculations. Results: Stockpiling was cost-effective from the health-care perspective if the actual risk is 37% for 30 years. If less than 60% of the population would take the antiviral drugs or the attack rate is about 50%, the investment would not be cost-effective from this perspective. Conclusion: Risk perception, realistic coverage among population and size of a pandemic are crucial parameters and highly decisive for the investment decision.","Lugnér, Anna K.; Postma, Maarten J.",Eur J Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7798111/,288

ApoA-I overexpression in apoE-deficient (EKO) mice has been shown to increase HDL levels and to strongly reduce atherosclerosis development. The aim of the study was to investigate gene expression patterns associated with atherosclerosis development in the aorta of EKO mice and how HDL plasma levels relate to gene expression patterns at different stages of atherosclerosis development and with different dietary treatments. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Eight-week-old EKO mice, EKO mice overexpressing human apoA-I, and wild-type mice as controls were fed either normal laboratory or Western diet for 6 or 22 weeks. Cholesterol distribution among lipoproteins was evaluated, and atherosclerosis of the aorta was quantified. High-throughput sequencing technologies were used to analyze the transcriptome of the aorta of the 3 genotypes in each experimental condition. In addition to the well-known activation of inflammation and immune response, the impairment of sphingolipid metabolism, phagosome-lysosome system, and osteoclast differentiation emerged as relevant players in atherosclerosis development. The reduced atherosclerotic burden in the aorta of EKO mice expressing high levels of apoA-I was accompanied by a reduced activation of immune system markers, as well as reduced perturbation of lysosomal activity and a better regulation of the sphingolipid synthesis pathway. CONCLUSIONS: ApoA-I modulates atherosclerosis development in the aorta of EKO mice affecting the expression of pathways additional to those associated with inflammation and immune response.","Busnelli, Marco; Manzini, Stefano; Chiara, Matteo; Colombo, Alice; Fontana, Fabrizio; Oleari, Roberto; Potì, Francesco; Horner, David; Bellosta, Stefano; Chiesa, Giulia",Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7837693/,288

In this study, we propose a novel deep convolutional neural network called SE-OnionNet, with two squeeze-and-excitation (SE) modules, to computationally predict the binding affinity of a protein–ligand complex. The OnionNet is used to extract a feature map from the three-dimensional structure of a protein–drug molecular complex. The SE module is added to the second and third convolutional layers to improve the non-linear expression of the network to improve model performance. Three different optimizers, stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, and Adagrad, were also used to improve the performance of the model. A majority of protein–molecule complexes were used for training, and the comparative assessment of scoring functions (CASF-2016) was used as the benchmark. Experimental results show that our model performs better than OnionNet, Pafnucy, and AutoDock Vina. Finally, we chose the macrophage migration inhibitor factor (PDB ID: 6cbg) to test the stability and robustness of the model. We found that the prediction results were not affected by the docking position, and thus, our model is of acceptable robustness.","Wang, Shudong; Liu, Dayan; Ding, Mao; Du, Zhenzhen; Zhong, Yue; Song, Tao; Zhu, Jinfu; Zhao, Renteng",Front Genet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7962986/,288

To date, our knowledge and interventions have not adequately addressed these issues. We assessed differences in well-being across the USA: (1) between all post-graduate trainees and their academic core faculty; (2) between all obstetrics and gynecology trainees and their academic core faculty and (3) during the progression of training within obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN).Methods: A cross-sectional study analyzing responses to well-being questions included in the 2017–2018 Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) surveys given to all U.S. trainees and core faculty. Results: More than 85% of all U.S. physician-trainees and faculty surveyed responded. Respondents included 128,443 trainees from all specialties combined, 5,206 OB/GYN residents and 799 OB/GYN subspecialty fellows. A total of 94,557 faculty from all specialties combined, 4,082 general OB/GYN faculty and 1,432 sub-specialty OB/GYN faculty responded. Trainees were more negative than faculty for the majority of questions for both all trainees combined and within OB/GYN when progressing from resident to subspecialty fellow to subspecialty faculty (p ≤ 0.05). Questions focusing on work satisfaction (e.g., pride in work) were more negative for residents compared to fellows and for fellows compared to faculty. In contrast to work satisfaction, responses to the question ‘Felt the amount of work you were expected to complete in a day was reasonable’ showed either no difference or higher scores for trainees compared to their faculty. Conclusions: Although an issue for all physicians, well-being impacts trainees more, and differently, than faculty and well-being improves during training from resident to fellow to faculty. Survey responses suggest that interventions should focus on workplace satisfaction over workplace environment areas and further limitations in duty hours are unlikely to improve physician well-being.","Frishman, Gary N.; Raker, Christina A.; Frankfurter, David",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8276666/,288
20762,"Respiratory Syncytial Virus–Associated Mortality Among Young Infants in Karachi, Pakistan: A Prospective Postmortem Surveillance Study",2021-09-02,"BACKGROUND: Tracheostomy represents one important and value-laden treatment decision after severe acute brain injury (SABI). Whether to pursue this life-sustaining treatment typically hinges on intense conversations between family and clinicians. The aim of this study was, among a cohort of patient who had undergone tracheostomy after SABI, to explore the long-term reflections of patients and their families as they look back on this decision. METHODS: For this qualitative study, we reviewed the electronic medical records of patients with SABI who underwent tracheostomy. We included all patients who were admitted to our 30-bed neuro-intensive care unit with SABI and underwent tracheostomy between November 2017 and October 2019. Using purposive sampling, we invited survivors and family members to participate in telephone interviews greater than 3 months after SABI until thematic saturation was reached. Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed, and analyzed by using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Overall, 38 patients with SABI in the neuro-intensive care unit underwent tracheostomy. The mean age of patients was 49 (range 18–81), with 19 of 38 patients diagnosed with traumatic brain injury and 19 of 38 with stroke. We interviewed 20 family members of 18 of 38 patients at a mean of 16 (SD 9) months after hospitalization. The mean patient age among those with an interview was 50 (range 18–76); the mean modified Rankin Scale score (mRS) was 4.7 (SD 0.8) at hospital discharge. At the time of the interview, ten patients lived at home and two in a skilled nursing facility and had a mean mRS of 2.6 (SD 0.9), and six had died. As families reflected on the decision to proceed with a tracheostomy, two themes emerged. First, families did not remember tracheostomy as a choice because the uncertain chance of recovery rendered the certain alternative of death unacceptable or because they valued survival above all and therefore could not perceive an alternative to life-sustaining treatment. Second, families identified a fundamental need to receive supportive, consistent communication centering around compassion, clarity, and hope. When this need was met, families were able to reflect on the tracheostomy decision with peace, regardless of their loved one’s eventual outcome. CONCLUSIONS: After SABI, prognostic uncertainty almost transcends the concept of choice. Families who proceeded with a tracheostomy saw it as the only option at the time. High-quality communication may mitigate the stress surrounding this high-stakes decision.

22245,International Conference on Emerging Infectious Diseases,2004-11-11,"The news media, specifically online newspapers, is one of the powerful transmitters of discourse due to its rapid accessibility that contributes to social beliefs and attitudes that often shape our perceptions on dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. The media portrayal of dementia is largely heterogeneous, but there is certainly an association between the influence of online news coverage and the social perceptions of dementia that need to be understood more broadly. In this study, we examined the portrayal of dementia in two online newspapers (The New York Times and The Guardian) that might have an influence on dementia discourse by comparing the content and form of the news coverage on dementia across time. This study was guided by three interconnected theoretical understandings: cultivation theory, agenda-setting theory, and spiral of silence theory. A total of 291 published articles featuring dementia from 2014 to 2019 were included in this study and a content analysis of the articles provided insight into the dementia-related news coverage. Our results showed that both newspapers have a decreasing trend in publishing articles related to dementia over time. In addition, dementia-related (modifiable) risk factors as principal news content was significantly associated with the year of publication. Despite a weak association between story categories and newspapers, the majority of articles reported preventive measures as the main story category. Although both newspapers featured more articles with a less negative tone across time when reporting on dementia, derogative wording, as discourse, was commonly used to address the illness. We have provided some insight into understanding how online newspapers potentially affect subjective representations of dementia as well as perpetuate dementia discourse. Finally, we suggest that future study may benefit from establishing a linkage between the depiction of dementia in online newspapers and the contextualization of dementia within cultures.","sm-Rahman, Atiqur; Lo, Chih Hung; Jahan, Yasmin",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8508449/,288

Considering mass tourism as a reality of our contemporary life that cannot be neglected by current efforts to endorse sustainable tourism, this paper draws attention to one of its key players—the tour operators—advancing the proposition that they play significant roles in affecting changes in behaviors and attitudes towards more responsible forms of tourism. Aiming to facilitate a constructive debate on the matter, the article presents a few of the most important arguments that underscore the potential that tour operators’ have in promoting sustainable tourism.","Budeanu, Adriana",J Clean Prod,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7125848/,288

Contemporary social media offers almost everyone a platform to publish one’s own thoughts, opinions, political statements and others, some of which may gain significant interest of others and thereby become so called “influencers”. This role has in the past been held by news agencies primarily, but this role is increasingly adopted also by private people and among them, also some who do not necessarily adhere the high standards of good journalism or scientific ethics. These give rise to fake news, spreading as unconfirmed rumors and possibly causing dramatic impacts to a society. With information available almost everywhere in the internet today, the distinction between good and bad sources has become a challenge, and highly difficult task. Even more intricate is the question of verifying information against multiple independent sources. If many people say something, does this make it true or any more plausible? Do we need to trust information in lack of better information? Is it possible to judge information and make our own opinion about its validity, quality, relevance or usefulness for our own business? This article shall provide pointers towards answers to the above questions. We discuss some technical means of judging the quality of information and what anyone, even without much technical background can do to avoid falling victim to fake information and fake news.","Rass, Stefan",Mind Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7415329/,288

42402,319O The systemic pro-inflammatory response identifies cancer patients with adverse outcomes from SARS-CoV-2 infection,2020-11-22,"BACKGROUND: While hospital-acquired influenza A results in an additional cost burden and considerable mortality in patients, its risk factors are unknown. We aimed to describe the characteristics of patients vulnerable to hospital-acquired influenza A and to identify its risk factors to assist clinicians control hospital-acquired infections and reduce the burden of treatment. METHODS: A case-control study was conducted among hospitalized patients aged ≥18 years at a tertiary level teaching hospital during the 2018–2019 influenza A season. Patient data were retrieved from hospital-based electronic medical records. Hospital-acquired influenza A was defined as a case of influenza A diagnosed 7 days or more after admission, in a patient with no evidence of influenza A infection on admission. The controls without influenza A were selected among patients exposed to the same setting and time period. We identified risk factors using conditional logistic regression and described the characteristics of hospital-acquired influenza A by comparing the clinical data of infected patients and the controls. RESULTS: Of the 412 hospitalized patients with influenza A from all the departments in the study hospital, 93 (22.6%) cases were classified as hospital-acquired. The most common comorbidities of the 93 cases were hypertension (41.9%), coronary heart disease (21.5%), and cerebrovascular disease (20.4%). Before the onset of hospital-acquired influenza A, patients presented more lymphocytopenia (51.6% vs 35.5%, P = 0.027), hypoalbuminemia (78.5% vs 57.0%, P = 0.002), and pleural effusion (26.9% vs 9.7%, P = 0.002) than the matched controls. Infected patients also had longer hospital stays (18 days vs 14 days, P = 0.002), and higher mortality rates (10.8% vs 2.2%, P = 0.017) than the matched controls. Lymphocytopenia (odds ratio [OR]: 3.11; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.24–7.80; P = 0.016), hypoalbuminemia (OR: 2.24; 95% CI: 1.10–4.57; P = 0.027), and pleural effusion (OR: 3.09; 95% CI: 1.26–7.58; P = 0.014) were independently associated with hospital-acquired influenza A. CONCLUSIONS: Lymphocytopenia, hypoalbuminemia and pleural effusion are independent risk factors that can help identify patients at high risk of hospital-acquired influenza A, which can extend hospital stay and is associated with a high mortality.

The current method is invasive, time-consuming and prone to manual errors. These disadvantages show how essential it is to perform a fully automated method for multi-classification of brain tumors based on deep learning. This paper aims to make multi-classification of brain tumors for the early diagnosis purposes using convolutional neural network (CNN). Three different CNN models are proposed for three different classification tasks. Brain tumor detection is achieved with 99.33% accuracy using the first CNN model. The second CNN model can classify the brain tumor into five brain tumor types as normal, glioma, meningioma, pituitary and metastatic with an accuracy of 92.66%. The third CNN model can classify the brain tumors into three grades as Grade II, Grade III and Grade IV with an accuracy of 98.14%. All the important hyper-parameters of CNN models are automatically designated using the grid search optimization algorithm. To the best of author’s knowledge, this is the first study for multi-classification of brain tumor MRI images using CNN whose almost all hyper-parameters are tuned by the grid search optimizer. The proposed CNN models are compared with other popular state-of-the-art CNN models such as AlexNet, Inceptionv3, ResNet-50, VGG-16 and GoogleNet. Satisfactory classification results are obtained using large and publicly available clinical datasets. The proposed CNN models can be employed to assist physicians and radiologists in validating their initial screening for brain tumor multi-classification purposes.","Irmak, Emrah",Iran J Sci Technol Trans Electr Eng,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8061452/,288

57025,Research in brief,2021-08-24,"Introduction: The lips and the mouth play an indispensable role in vocalization, mastication and face aesthetics. Various noxious factors may alter and destruct the original structure, and appearance of the lips and the anatomical area surrounding the mouth. The application of hyaluronic acid (HA) may serve as a safe method for lip regeneration. Although a number of studies exist for HA effectiveness and safety, its beneficial effect is not well-established. Aim: The present meta-analysis and systematic review was performed to investigate the effectiveness of HA on lip augmentation. We also investigated the types and nature of adverse effects (AEs) of HA application. Methods: We reported our meta-analysis in accordance with the PRISMA Statement. PROSPERO protocol registration: CRD42018102899. We performed the systematic literature search in CENTRAL, Embase, and MEDLINE. Randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, case series and case reports were included. The untransformed proportion (random-effects, DerSimonian-Laird method) of responder rate to HA injection was calculated. For treatment related AEs descriptive statistics were used. Results: The systematic literature search yielded 32 eligible records for descriptive statistics and 10 records for quantitative synthesis. The results indicated that the overall estimate of responders (percentage of subjects with increased lip fullness by one point or higher) was 91% (ES = 0.91, 95% CI:0.85−0.96) 2 months after injection. The rate of responders was 74% (ES = 0.74, 95% CI:0.66−0.82) and 46% (ES = 0.46, 95% CI:0.28−0.65) after 6 and 12 months, respectively. We included 1,496 participants for estimating the event rates of AEs. The most frequent treatment-related AEs were tenderness (88.8%), injection site swelling (74.3%) and bruising (39.5%). Rare AEs included foreign body granulomas (0.6%), herpes labialis (0.6%) and angioedema (0.3%). Conclusion: Our meta-analysis revealed that lip augmentation with injectable HA is an efficient method for increasing lip fullness for at least up to 6 months after augmentation. Moreover, we found that most AEs of HA treatment were mild or moderate, but a small number of serious adverse effects were also found. In conclusion, further well-designed RCTs are still needed to make the presently available evidence stronger.","Czumbel, László Márk; Farkasdi, Sándor; Gede, Noémi; Mikó, Alexandra; Csupor, Dezső; Lukács, Anita; Gaál, Valéria; Kiss, Szabolcs; Hegyi, Péter; Varga, Gábor",Front Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8377277/,288
57535,Effect of adding bemiparin and cefepime to routine treatment in cancer patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection,2021-09-08,"BACKGROUND: Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), a highly aggressive cancer, was mainly attributed to asbestos exposure. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) share similar negative features to asbestos, provoking concerns about their contribution to MPM. This study was used to identify genes associated with CNT-induced MPM. METHODS: Microarray datasets were available in the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The limma method was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in CNT-exposed MeT5A cells (GSE48855) or mice (GSE51636). Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) and protein–protein interaction (PPI) network construction were conducted to screen hub DEGs. The mRNA expression levels of hub DEGs were validated on MPM samples of GSE51024, GSE2549 and GSE42977 datasets, and their diagnostic efficacy was determined by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. The prognostic values of hub DEGs were assessed using online tools based on The Cancer Genome Atlas data. Their functions were annotated by Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) enrichment and correlation with immune cells and markers. RESULTS: WGCNA identified that two modules were associated with disease status. Thirty-one common DEGs in the GSE48855 and GSE51636 datasets were overlapped with the genes in these two modules. Twenty of them had a high degree centrality (≥4) in the PPI network. Four DEGs (FN1, fibronectin 1; UGCG, UDP-glucose ceramide glucosyltransferase; CHPF2, chondroitin polymerizing factor 2; and THBS2, thrombospondin 2) could predict the overall survival, and they were confirmed to be upregulated in MPM samples compared with controls. Also, they could effectively predict the MPM risk, with an overall accuracy of >0.9. DAVID analysis revealed FN1, CHPF2 and THBS2 functioned in cell-ECM interactions; UGCG influenced glycosphingolipid metabolism. All genes were positively associated with infiltrating levels of immune cells (macrophages or dendritic cells) and the expression of the dendritic cell marker (NRP1, neuropilin 1). CONCLUSION: These four immune-related genes represent potential biomarkers for monitoring CNT-induced MPM and predicting the prognosis.","Xie, Dongli; Hu, Jianchen; Wu, Tong; Cao, Kangli; Luo, Xiaogang",Int J Gen Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8412823/,288
57655,SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with sickle cell disease(),2021-09-10,"We study yield spreads between government bonds in the European Monetary Union. This segment of the global fixed income market is of particular importance for insurance companies in Europe. Our empirical research strategy is inspired by Gunay (2020) who has analyzed the relationship between credit and liquidity risk in the United States using Granger causality tests. More specifically, we employ the procedure developed by Toda and Yamamoto (1995) to test for Granger causality among yield spreads in five different member countries of the European Monetary Union (namely Austria, Belgium, France, Italy and Ireland) relative to Germany. We examine interest rate data from bonds with three different maturities (5, 10 and 30 years). Given the importance of long-term bonds as asset class for European life insurers and pension funds, the empirical results from the often ignored market for government bonds with a maturity of 30 years should be of interest. With regard to long-term sovereign debt, there is no evidence for Granger causality among the time series examined here. Consequently, the risk premia required by investors to hold government bonds of one specific member country of the EMU do not help to forecast the risk premia that have to be paid by other countries. Given the structure of their liabilities, this empirical finding should be of high relevance for portfolio and risk managers in the European life insurance industry and in pension funds. With regard to the yield spreads to be observed in the market for 10-year government bonds, there seems to be no clear picture. Focusing on fixed income securities with a maturity of 5 years, there is one very interesting empirical finding. The test results reported here seem to imply that there is unidirectional Granger causality running from the yield spreads in all other four countries to Austria. Given that Austria is a comparably small country which is assumed to be in a fiscally stable position, this result could be interpreted as evidence for credit risk premia as being helpful to forecast liquidity risk premia in the market for medium-term government bonds issued by member states of the European Monetary Union.","Tholl, Johannes; Basse, Tobias; Meier, Samira; Rodriguez Gonzalez, Miguel",ZVersWiss,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8422063/,288

Poor sleep quality may be linked to poor mental health and increased suicide ideation. To contextualise the risk factors associated with self-harm or suicidal ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic, this cross-sectional study examined links between poor sleep quality, individual experiences and self-harm risk. METHODS: N=1544 (Mage=44.3y) from 63 countries completed an online survey in March-April 2020. Participants reported their pandemic experiences as free text responses, which were examined quantitatively for frequent word usage using Linguist Inquiry and Word Count software. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index assessed poor sleep quality (cut-off score >8). Item-9 of Patient Health Questionnaire-9 measured the risk of self-harm. RESULTS: Individuals with poor sleep quality (45%) used more negative emotional tone and had greater use of anxiety or money-related words in their comments than good sleepers (all ps<.05). Additionally, 19% of respondents (n=295) reported thoughts of self-harm at least several days a week (3.4% nearly every day). Logistic regression indicated that younger individuals, males, and those feeling isolated or less resilient had 1.2 to 1.5 times greater risk of self-harm (all ps<.001). Poor sleep quality was associated with a two-fold increased risk of self-harm (95%CI=1.5–2.7, p<.0001) after controlling for demographic variables. DISCUSSION: Poor sleep quality is linked to negative emotionality and increased risk of self-harm during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sleep is a modifiable factor; therefore interventions aimed at addressing sleep disturbances may improve resilience and reduce the risk of self-harm in vulnerable individuals.","Varma, P; Burge, M; Meaklim, H; Junge, M; Jackson, M",Sleep Adv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8500162/,288

Situated in the context of Turkish higher education, this study examines Eda’s narrative accounts with regard to the development of test adaptation and implementation, technology use, and the emerging contradictions for future language testing practices. The data are analysed based on Clandinin and Connelly’s (in Narrative inquiry: Experience and story in qualitative research, Jossey-Bass, 2000) three-dimensional space narrative structure: interaction, continuity, and situation. First, personal and social interaction are analysed to better understand test-designers’ dispositions and views, and internal and existential conditions in testing practices in the pandemic. Second, continuity is dealt with in regard to their testing experiences, emerging needs, and implied roles and directions of stakeholders in online testing. Third, the situation is analysed to understand the new landscape where the online test implementation is bounded by pandemic rules and regulations. Third generation activity theory was used to interpret the results of analysis. The study concludes by recognizing how resolutions produce motives for high-stakes test implementation and how the dynamic relation between constructs of activity systems supports the continuity of online test beyond pandemic times.","Güngör, Müzeyyen Nazlı; Güngör, Mustafa Akın",Asia-Pacific Edu Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8506477/,288

Based on 22 interviews that capture the experiences of food insecure college students as they attempt to navigate SNAP, this study shows how low enrollment in the program and food insecurity are the predictable outcomes of policy decisions intended to restrict access to both free public higher education and public assistance in the 1980’s and 1990’s and were shaped by the racialized politics of deservingness. By documenting the barriers students encounter attempting to access food assistance, this study shows how these policies play out in the lives of students at the City University of New York (CUNY) today. Ultimately, the politics of deservingness create significant direct and indirect barriers to SNAP enrollment for students and limit policy makers’ and advocates’ attempts to expand SNAP and address food insecurity on college campuses.

The main objective of this investigation was to compare glaucoma diagnostic accuracy of commercially available optical coherence tomography (OCT) devices (Zeiss Stratus, Zeiss Cirrus, Heidelberg Spectralis and Optovue RTVue, and Topcon 3D-OCT). PATIENTS 16,104 glaucomatous and 11,543 normal eyes reported in 150 studies. METHODS Between Jan. 2017 and Feb 2017, MEDLINE®, EMBASE®, CINAHL®, Cochrane Library®, Web of Science®, and BIOSIS® were searched for studies assessing glaucoma diagnostic accuracy of the aforementioned OCT devices. Meta-analysis was performed pooling area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) estimates for all devices, stratified by OCT type (RNFL, macula), and area imaged. RESULTS 150 studies with 16,104 glaucomatous and 11,543 normal control eyes were included. Key findings: AUROC of glaucoma diagnosis for RNFL average for all glaucoma patients was 0.897 (0.887-0.906, n = 16,782 patient eyes), for macula ganglion cell complex (GCC) was 0.885 (0.869-0.901, n = 4841 eyes), for macula ganglion cell inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) was 0.858 (0.835-0.880, n = 4211 eyes), and for total macular thickness was 0.795 (0.754-0.834, n = 1063 eyes). CONCLUSION The classification capability was similar across all 5 OCT devices. More diagnostically favorable AUROCs were demonstrated in patients with increased glaucoma severity. Diagnostic accuracy of RNFL and segmented macular regions (GCIPL, GCC) scans were similar and higher than total macular thickness. This study provides a synthesis of contemporary evidence with features of robust inclusion criteria and large sample size. These findings may provide guidance to clinicians when navigating this rapidly evolving diagnostic area characterized by numerous options.","Kansal, Vinay; Armstrong, James J; Pintwala, Robert; Hutnik, Cindy",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0190621; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29300765/,288

However, early detection of neoplasia can be challenging since most patients are asymptomatic until they progress to more advanced and less curable stages, and early dysplastic lesions can be small, multifocal, and difficult to detect. Clearly, new imaging tools are needed in light of sampling error associated with random biopsies, the current standard of practice. RECENT FINDINGS Advances in endoscopic imaging including virtual chromoendoscopy, confocal laser endomicroscopy, and subsurface imaging with optical coherence tomography have ushered in a new era for detecting subtle neoplastic lesions. Moreover, in light of esophagus-sparing treatments for neoplastic lesions, such tools are likely to guide ablation and follow-up management. While there is no ideal single imaging modality to facilitate improved detection, staging, ablation, and follow-up of patients with dysplastic Barrett's esophagus, new advances in available technology, the potential for multimodal imaging, and the use of computer-aided diagnosis and biomarkers all hold great promise for improving detection and treatment.","Mkarimi, Mansoureh; Mashimo, Hiroshi",Current gastroenterology reports,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11894-018-0661-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30302571/,288
66718,Added value of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing in a Flemish nursing home during an acute COVID-19 outbreak in April 2020.,2020-10-18,"BACKGROUND Tuberculosis is a leading cause of infectious disease-related death and is one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of specific rapid molecular tests, including Xpert MTB/RIF or Xpert Ultra, as initial diagnostic tests for the detection of tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in people with signs and symptoms of tuberculosis. However, the WHO estimates that nearly one-third of all active tuberculosis cases go undiagnosed and unreported. We were interested in whether a single test, Xpert MTB/RIF or Xpert Ultra, could be useful as a screening test to close this diagnostic gap and improve tuberculosis case detection. OBJECTIVES To estimate the accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra for screening for pulmonary tuberculosis in adults, irrespective of signs or symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis in high-risk groups and in the general population. Screening ""irrespective of signs or symptoms"" refers to screening of people who have not been assessed for the presence of tuberculosis symptoms (e.g. cough). To estimate the accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra for detecting rifampicin resistance in adults screened for tuberculosis, irrespective of signs and symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis in high-risk groups and in the general population. SEARCH METHODS We searched 12 databases including the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, MEDLINE and Embase, on 19 March 2020 without language restrictions. We also reviewed reference lists of included articles and related Cochrane Reviews, and contacted researchers in the field to identify additional studies. SELECTION CRITERIA Cross-sectional and cohort studies in which adults (15 years and older) in high-risk groups (e.g. people living with HIV, household contacts of people with tuberculosis) or in the general population were screened for pulmonary tuberculosis using Xpert MTB/RIF or Xpert Ultra. For tuberculosis detection, the reference standard was culture. For rifampicin resistance detection, the reference standards were culture-based drug susceptibility testing and line probe assays. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently extracted data using a standardized form and assessed risk of bias and applicability using QUADAS-2. We used a bivariate random-effects model to estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity with 95% credible intervals (CrIs) separately for tuberculosis detection and rifampicin resistance detection. We estimated all models using a Bayesian approach. For tuberculosis detection, we first estimated screening accuracy in distinct high-risk groups, including people living with HIV, household contacts, people residing in prisons, and miners, and then in several high-risk groups combined. MAIN RESULTS We included a total of 21 studies: 18 studies (13,114 participants) evaluated Xpert MTB/RIF as a screening test for pulmonary tuberculosis and one study (571 participants) evaluated both Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra. Three studies (159 participants) evaluated Xpert MTB/RIF for rifampicin resistance. Fifteen studies (75%) were conducted in high tuberculosis burden and 16 (80%) in high TB/HIV-burden countries. We judged most studies to have low risk of bias in all four QUADAS-2 domains and low concern for applicability. Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra as screening tests for pulmonary tuberculosis In people living with HIV (12 studies), Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity and specificity (95% CrI) were 61.8% (53.6 to 69.9) (602 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and 98.8% (98.0 to 99.4) (4173 participants; high-certainty evidence). Of 1000 people where 50 have tuberculosis on culture, 40 would be Xpert MTB/RIF-positive; of these, 9 (22%) would not have tuberculosis (false-positives); and 960 would be Xpert MTB/RIF-negative; of these, 19 (2%) would have tuberculosis (false-negatives). In people living with HIV (1 study), Xpert Ultra sensitivity and specificity (95% CI) were 69% (57 to 80) (68 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and 98% (97 to 99) (503 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Of 1000 people where 50 have tuberculosis on culture, 53 would be Xpert Ultra-positive; of these, 19 (36%) would not have tuberculosis (false-positives); and 947 would be Xpert Ultra-negative; of these, 16 (2%) would have tuberculosis (false-negatives). In non-hospitalized people in high-risk groups (5 studies), Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity and specificity were 69.4% (47.7 to 86.2) (337 participants, low-certainty evidence) and 98.8% (97.2 to 99.5) (8619 participants, moderate-certainty evidence). Of 1000 people where 10 have tuberculosis on culture, 19 would be Xpert MTB/RIF-positive; of these, 12 (63%) would not have tuberculosis (false-positives); and 981 would be Xpert MTB/RIF-negative; of these, 3 (0%) would have tuberculosis (false-negatives). We did not identify any studies using Xpert MTB/RIF or Xpert Ultra for screening in the general population. Xpert MTB/RIF as a screening test for rifampicin resistance Xpert MTB/RIF sensitivity was 81% and 100% (2 studies, 20 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and specificity was 94% to 100%, (3 studies, 139 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Of the high-risks groups evaluated, Xpert MTB/RIF applied as a screening test was accurate for tuberculosis in high tuberculosis burden settings. Sensitivity and specificity were similar in people living with HIV and non-hospitalized people in high-risk groups. In people living with HIV, Xpert Ultra sensitivity was slightly higher than that of Xpert MTB/RIF and specificity similar. As there was only one study of Xpert Ultra in this analysis, results should be interpreted with caution. There were no studies that evaluated the tests in people with diabetes mellitus and other groups considered at high-risk for tuberculosis, or in the general population.","Shapiro, Adrienne E; Ross, Jennifer M; Yao, Mandy; Schiller, Ian; Kohli, Mikashmi; Dendukuri, Nandini; Steingart, Karen R; Horne, David J",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd013694.pub2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33755189/,288

Therefore, LATG requires further study. PATIENTS AND METHODS A total of 663 patients who underwent LADG or LATG for gastric cancer in a single institution from April 2004 to April 2014 were included. The clinicopathologic characteristics and risk factors related to major complications (Clavien-Dindo grade ≥ IIIa) were analyzed between the LADG (n = 569) and LATG groups (n = 94). RESULTS The incidence of major postoperative complications was significantly higher for LATG (LADG vs. LATG: 8.1 vs. 18.1 %, P = 0.002). Although postoperative bleeding was not different between the groups (3.2 vs. 3.2 %, P = 0.991), the incidence of bowel leakage was significantly higher for LATG (2.6 vs. 6.8 %, P = 0.028). Leakage from the anastomosis site was more frequent following LATG (5.3 %) compared with LADG (0.5 %) (P < 0.001). Leakage from the duodenal stump tended to be more frequent, though not significant, for LADG (2.0 vs. 1.1 %, P = 0.602). Advanced gastric cancer, LATG, and longer operation time were significant factors that affected the incidence of postoperative complications in a univariate analysis. In multivariate analysis, there were no independent risk factors, but LATG was nearly a significant, independent risk factor (odds ratio 1.89; 95 % CI 0.965-3.71, P = 0.063). CONCLUSION More major complications were observed for LATG, particularly with esophagojejunostomy. These results show that LATG is more invasive than LADG in terms of the postoperative morbidity. More caution and experience are needed when performing LATG.","Kim, Dong Jin; Lee, Jun Hyun; Kim, Wook",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-014-4053-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25582964/,288

This retrospective study assessed the safety and efficacy of Neuroform Atlas stenting as a rescue treatment after failure of mechanical thrombetomy (MT) for large artery occlusion. METHODS Between June 2018 and December 2019, a total of 31 patients underwent Neuroform Atlas stenting with prior Gateway balloon angioplasty after failure of conventional MT caused by residual intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS). Primary outcomes were successful recanalization and patency of the vessel 24 hours after intervention. Secondary outcomes were vessel patency after 14 days and 3-month modified Rankin Scale. Peri-procedural complications, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and 3-month mortality were reviewed. RESULTS With a 100% of successful recanalization, median value of stenosis was reduced from 79.0% to 23.5%. Twenty-eight patients (90.3%) showed tolerable vessel patency after 14 days. New infarctions occurred in three patients (9.7%) over a period of 14 days; two patient (6.5%) underwent stent occlusion at 24 hours, and the other patient (3.2%) with delayed stent occlusion had a non-symptomatic dot infarct. There were no peri-procedural complications. Two patients (6.5%) developed an ICH immediately after the procedure with one of them is symptomatic. CONCLUSION Neuroform Atlas stenting seems to be an effective and safe rescue treatment modality for failed MT with residual ICAS, by its high successful recanalization rate with tolerable patency, and low peri-procedural complication rate. Further multicenter and randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm our findings.","Yi, Ho Jun; Sung, Jae Hoon; Lee, Dong Hoon",Journal of Korean Neurosurgical Society,https://doi.org/10.3340/jkns.2020.0146; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33715323/,288
72980,SARS-CoV-2 From the Trenches: A Perspective From New York City.,2020-04-17,"We have described previously an immunostimulant derived from Onchocerca volvulus, the helminth parasite that causes onchocerciasis. Recombinant O. volvulus activation-associated secreted protein-1 (rOv-ASP-1) was a potent adjuvant for antibody and cellular responses to protein, polypeptide and small peptide antigens. Our aims were to determine whether rOv-ASP-1 is immunostimulatory for human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and, if so, whether it could augment cellular responses against human pathogen antigens in vitro. Cytokines from rOv-ASP-1-stimulated human PBMC were measured by a fluorescence activated cell sorter-based multiplex assay. Recall responses of normal healthy donor (NHD) and chronic hepatitis C virus (c-HCV)-infected patient PBMC to tetanus toxoid (TT) or HCV core (HCVco) antigen, respectively, were measured by interferon-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot assays. Interferon-gamma was the predominant cytokine induced by rOv-ASP-1. 77.3% of NHD anti-TT and 88.9% of c-HCV anti-HCVco responses were enhanced by rOv-ASP-1. The immunostimulant effect was dependent upon contact between CD56+ and CD56- fractions of PBMC. We have described a helminth-derived protein that can act as an immunostimulant for human recall responses in vitro to TT and, perhaps more importantly, HCV antigens in patients with chronic HCV infection. Our longer-term goal would be to boost anti-viral responses in chronic infections such as HCV.","MacDonald, A J; Libri, N A; Lustigman, S; Barker, S J; Whelan, M A; Semper, A E; Rosenberg, W M",Clinical and experimental immunology,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2249.2008.03623.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18341617/,288

75915,[SARS-CoV-2 Detection in cerebrospinal fluid in a pediatric patient. Case report].,2021-02-01,"Background Ventricular septal defects (VSD), when treated correctly in childhood, are considered to have great prognoses, and the majority of patients are discharged from follow-up when entering their teens. Young adults were previously found to have poorer functional capacity than healthy peers, but the question remains whether functional capacity degenerates further with age. Methods and Results A group of 30 patients with surgically closed VSDs (51±8 years) with 30 matched, healthy control participants (52±9 years) and a group of 30 patients with small unrepaired VSDs (55±12 years) and 30 matched control participants (55±10 years) underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing using an incremental workload protocol and noninvasive gas measurement. Peak oxygen uptake was lower in participants with closed VSDs than matched controls (24±7 versus 34±9 mL/min per kg, P<0.01) and with unrepaired VSDs than matched controls (26±5 versus 32±8 mL/min per kg, P<0.01). Patients demonstrated lower oxygen uptake from exercise levels at 20% of maximal workload compared with respective control groups (P<0.01). Peak ventilation was lower in patients with surgically closed VSDs than control participants (1.0±0.3 versus 1.4±0.4 L/min per kg, P<0.01) but similar in patients with unrepaired VSDs and control participants (P=0.14). Exercise capacity was 29% lower in older patients with surgically closed VSDs than healthy peers, whereas younger patients with surgically closed VSDs previously demonstrated 18% lower capacity compared with peers. Older patients with unrepaired VSDs reached 21% lower exercise capacity, whereas younger patients with unrepaired VSDs previously demonstrated 17% lower oxygen uptake than healthy peers. Conclusions Patients with VSDs demonstrate poorer exercise capacity than healthy peers. The difference between patients and control participants increased with advancing age-and increased most in patients with operated VSDs-compared with previous findings in younger patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS We report a case series and a subgroup analysis. Patients treated at our Centre for CLM (1991-2020) were divided in two groups: patients treated with video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and open thoracotomy (OT). Characteristics of the two groups were compared through statistical analysis (GraphPad Prism7®). A p-value<0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS One hundred six patients were included: 58 in VATS group, 48 in OT group. Prenatal diagnosis was possible in 73.6%. The most frequent surgical procedures were lobectomy (43.4%) and sequestrectomy (22.6%). All VATS patients underwent lung exclusion, mostly by endobronchial blocker (69%). Mean operative time was 146.1 minutes (+/-52.04 SD) in VATS and 159.2 (+/-46.53 SD) in OT (p= 0,1973). Conversion to OT was necessary in 20.6% of VATS patients, but decreased in the last 5 years (6.2%). There were not any intraoperative complication. Respectively in VATS and OT group, length of stay (LOS) was 4.5 days +/-3.6SD versus 7.7+/-3.4SD (p<0.0001), chest tube duration 2.8 days +/-3.4SD versus 3.7+/-2.4SD (p<0.0001), antibiotic treatment duration 3.7 days +/-4.7SD versus 5+/-2.6SD (p = 0.1196). Postoperative complications were described in 22.6%. The commonest histological diagnosis (40.6%) was congenital pulmonary airway malformation. CONCLUSIONS VATS resulted a feasible, effective and safe technique. Operative time and postoperative complications were similar in VATS and OT groups. VATS conversion rate decreased in time. VATS had a statistically significant shorter LOS and chest tube duration. This article is protected by copyright.

Considering the crucial role of microorganisms on soil functions, we aimed to study the effects of 10 mg kg-1 soil of Ag2S NPs or AgNO3 on the soil microbiome, using an indoor mesocosm. After 28 days of exposure, Ag2S NPs induced a significant change in the soil microbiome structure, at class, genera and OTU levels. For instance, a significantly higher abundance of Chitinophagia, known for its lignocellulose-degrading activity, was observed in Ag2S NPs-treated soil toward the control. Nevertheless, stronger effects were observed in AgNO3-treated soil, over time, due to its higher silver dissolution rate in porewater. Additionally, only the AgNO3-treated soil stimulates the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing (AOB; amoA gene) and nitrite-oxidizing (NOB; nxrB gene) bacteria, which are involved in the nitrification process. Distinct variants of amoA and nxrB genes emerged in silver-treated soils, suggesting a potential succession of AOB and NOB with different degree of silver-tolerance. Our study highlights the latter effects of Ag2S NPs on the soil microbiome composition, while AgNO3 exerted a stronger effect in both composition and functional parameters.","Peixoto, Sara; Loureiro, Susana; Henriques, Isabel",Journal of hazardous materials,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.126793; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399213/,288

This study aims to explore QoL and sexual function after a pregnancy complicated by PAS. METHODS Women who experienced a pregnancy complicated by PAS were invited to complete an online survey. Two validated surveys were completed: Short Form 36 (SF-36) and Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI). The mean scores were calculated and were compared between women by pregnancy outcomes. Continuous variables were presented as mean (standard deviation (SD)) and were compared to assess for significance between groups using independent t-test and one-way analysis of variance. Categorical variables were compared using χ2 test. RESULTS A total of 142 women responded to the survey. For the SF-36, physical health was significantly higher for women at 24-36 months postpartum compared to those from 0-6 months postpartum for physical functioning (mean difference 21.9 (95% confidence interval (CI) 10.2, 33.5), role limitation due to physical function (mean difference 32.1 (95% CI 9.4, 54.7)) and pain (mean difference 15.5 (95% CI 3.4, 30.9)). For the mental health domains, only vitality improved at 24-36 months compared to the first six months postpartum (mean difference 12.8 (95% CI 0.2, 25.5)). The mean FSFI score was 24.8 (±5.8), lower than the critical score of 26.5 indicating sexual dysfunction, and 56.8% (n = 75), scored less than 26.5. CONCLUSION Women after a pregnancy complicated by PAS had high scores on the physical health domains of SF-36.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Cross-sectional study. We prospectively enrolled a multiethnic cohort of asymptomatic adults with T2D and no history, signs, or symptoms of cardiovascular disease. Age-, sex-, and ethnicity-matched control subjects were recruited for comparison. Participants underwent bioanthropometric profiling, cardiopulmonary exercise testing, and cardiovascular magnetic resonance with adenosine stress perfusion imaging. Multivariable linear regression analysis was undertaken to identify independent associations between measures of cardiovascular structure and function and peak VO2. RESULTS A total of 247 adults with T2D (aged 51.8 ± 11.9 years, 55% males, 37% black or south Asian ethnicity, HbA1c 7.4 ± 1.1% [57 ± 12 mmol/mol], and duration of diabetes 61 [32-120] months) and 78 control subjects were included. Subjects with T2D had increased concentric left ventricular remodelling, reduced myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR), and markedly lower aerobic exercise capacity (peak VO2 18.0 ± 6.6 vs. 27.8 ± 9.0 mL/kg/min; P < 0.001) compared with control subjects. In a multivariable linear regression model containing age, sex, ethnicity, smoking status, and systolic blood pressure, only MPR (β = 0.822; P = 0.006) and left ventricular diastolic filling pressure (E/e') (β = -0.388; P = 0.001) were independently associated with peak VO2 in subjects with T2D.

85610,Co-colonization by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus in the throat during acute respiratory illnesses.,2016,"BACKGROUND Dengue and West Nile viruses are highly cross-reactive and have numerous parallels in geography, potential vector host (Aedes family of mosquitoes), and initial symptoms of infection. While the vast majority (> 80%) of both dengue and West Nile virus infections result in asymptomatic infections, a minority of individuals experience symptomatic infection and an even smaller proportion develop severe disease. The mechanisms by which these infections lead to severe disease in a subset of infected individuals is incompletely understood, but individual host differences including genetic factors and immune responses have been proposed. We sought to identify genetic risk factors that are associated with more severe disease outcomes for both viruses in order to shed light on possible shared mechanisms of resistance and potential therapeutic interventions. METHODS We applied a search strategy using four major databases (Medline, PubMed, Embase, and Global Health) to find all known genetic associations identified to date with dengue or West Nile virus disease. Here we present a review of our findings and a meta-analysis of genetic variants identified. RESULTS We found genetic variations that are significantly associated with infections of these viruses. In particular we found variation within the OAS1 (meta-OR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.69-1.00) and CCR5 (meta-OR = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.08-1.53) genes is significantly associated with West Nile virus disease, while variation within MICB (meta-OR = 2.35, 95% CI: 1.68-3.29), PLCE1 (meta-OR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.42-0.71), MBL2 (meta-OR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.02-2.31), and IFN-γ (meta-OR = 2.48, 95% CI: 1.30-4.71), is associated with dengue disease. CONCLUSIONS Despite substantial heterogeneity in populations studied, genes examined, and methodology, significant associations with genetic variants were found across studies within both diseases. These gene associations suggest a key role for immune mechanisms in susceptibility to severe disease. Further research is needed to elucidate the role of these genes in disease pathogenesis and may reveal additional genetic factors associated with disease severity.","Cahill, Megan E; Conley, Samantha; DeWan, Andrew T; Montgomery, Ruth R",BMC infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-018-3186-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29929468/,288

According to recurrent processing theory, early activity in primary sensory areas corresponds closely to phenomenal awareness. In support, research with electroencephalography found that in the visual and somatosensory modality, an early neural correlate of awareness is contralateral to the perceived side of stimulation. Thus, early activity is sensitive to the perceived side of visual and somatosensory stimulation. Critically, it is unresolved whether this is true also for hearing. In the present study (N = 26 students), Bayesian analyses showed that the early neural correlate of awareness (auditory awareness negativity, AAN) was stronger for contralateral than ipsilateral electrodes whereas the late correlate of auditory awareness (late positivity, LP) was not lateralized. These findings demonstrate that the early but not the late neural correlate of auditory awareness reflects lateralized experiences. Thus, these findings imply that AAN is a more suitable NCC than LP because it correlates more closely with lateralized experiences.","Eklund, Rasmus; Gerdfeldter, Billy; Wiens, Stefan",Neuropsychologia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2021.107910; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34090867/,288
90794,An adult returned traveler from Dubai hospitalized with an influenza-like illness (ILI): Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) or influenza? Infection control implications from a near MERS case.,2015,"BACKGROUND In general surgery, minimally invasive laparoscopic procedures have been steadily increasing over the last decade. The application of advanced bipolar and ultrasonic energy devices for sealing and cutting of blood vessels plays a vital role in routine clinical procedures. The advantages of energy-based instruments are enhanced sealing capability combined with both fast sealing time and minimal thermal injury. The purpose of this study was to compare the safety and efficacy profiles of nine laparoscopic sealing and cutting devices in a porcine model, with a new scoring system. METHODS Comparative studies in a porcine model were performed to assess vessel sealing, burst pressure, thermal spread, maximum heat, sealing/cooling time, and compression strength over the full jaw. Nine different devices from five manufacturers were tested in this study. The sealing and cutting devices (SCD) score has been developed to enable standardized comparisons of various devices. For this purpose, the most important parameters were identified through a consensus approach. RESULTS All sealed vessels with different devices could withstand a median pressure of more than 300 mmHg (range 112-2046 mmHg). The time for the sealing procedure was 7.705 s (range 5.305-18.38 s) for the ultrasonic and 7.860 s (range 5.08-10.17 s) for the bipolar devices. The ultrasonic instruments reached a median temperature of 218.1 °C (range 81.3-349.75 °C) and the bipolar devices a temperature of 125.5 °C (range 94.1-133.35 °C). The tissue reached a median temperature of 61.9 (range 47.1-80.6 °C) after ultrasonic sealing and 76.7 °C (range 63.1-94.2 °C) after bipolar sealing. The median SCD score was 10.47 (range 7.16-13.72). CONCLUSION All the instruments used seemed safe for use on the patient. The SCD score allows an indirect comparability of the instruments.","Brecht, Lea; Wallwiener, Markus; Schott, Sarah; Domschke, Christoph; Dinkic, Christine; Golatta, Michael; Schuetz, Florian; Fluhr, Herbert; Stenzinger, Albrecht; Kirchner, Marietta; Sohn, Christof; Rom, Joachim",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-017-5778-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28840380/,288
91555,High genotypic diversity of Rhinoviruses obtained from Tunisian children with severe acute respiratory infection.,2021-05-31,"Proteasomes are multi-catalytic complexes with important roles in protein control. Their activity in stored red blood cells (RBCs) is affected by both storage time and the donor's characteristics. However, apart from their abundancy in the membrane proteome, not much is known about their topology, activity, and networking during the storage of RBCs from beta-thalassemia trait donors (βThal+). For this purpose, RBC units from fourteen βThal+ donors were fractionated and studied for proteasome activity distribution and interactome through fluorometric and correlation analyses against units of sex- and aged-matched controls. In all the samples examined, we observed a time-dependent translocation and/or activation of the proteasome in the membrane and a tight connection of activity with the oxidative burden of cells. Proteasomes were more active in the βThal+ membranes and supernatants, while the early storage networking of 20S core particles and activities showed a higher degree of connectivity with chaperones, calpains, and peroxiredoxins, which were nonetheless present in all interactomes. Moreover, the βThal+ interactomes were specially enriched in kinases, metabolic enzymes, and proteins differentially expressed in βThal+ membrane, including arginase-1, piezo-1, and phospholipid scramblase. Overall, it seems that βThal+ erythrocytes maintain a considerable ""proteo-vigilance"" during storage, which is closely connected to their distinct antioxidant dynamics and membrane protein profile.","Anastasiadi, Alkmini T; Tzounakas, Vassilis L; Arvaniti, Vasiliki-Zoi; Dzieciatkowska, Monika; Stamoulis, Konstantinos; Lekka, Marilena E; Papassideri, Issidora S; D'Alessandro, Angelo; Kriebardis, Anastasios G; Antonelou, Marianna H",Membranes,https://doi.org/10.3390/membranes11090716; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34564533/,288
94507,Antibody and T Cell Response to SARS-CoV-2 Messenger RNA BNT162b2 Vaccine in Kidney Transplant Recipients and Hemodialysis Patients.,2021-06-10,"OBJECTIVE Global outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has forced healthcare systems worldwide to reshape their facilities and protocols. Although not considered the frontline specialty in managing COVID-19 patients, neurosurgical service and training were also significantly affected. This article focuses on the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak at a low- and/or middle-income country (LMIC) academic tertiary referral hospital, the university and hospital policies and actions for the neurosurgical service and training program during the outbreak, and the contingency plan for future reference on preparedness for service and education. METHODS The authors collected data from several official databases, including the Indonesian Ministry of Health database, East Java provincial government database, hospital database, and neurosurgery operative case log. Policies and regulations information was obtained from stakeholders, including the Indonesian Society of Neurological Surgeons, the hospital board of directors, and the dean's office. RESULTS The curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Indonesia had not flattened by the 2nd week of June 2020. Surabaya, the second-largest city in Indonesia, became the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in Indonesia. The neurosurgical service experienced a significant drop in cases (50% of cases from normal days) along all lines (outpatient clinic, emergency room, and surgical ward). Despite a strict preadmission screening, postoperative COVID-19 infection cases were detected during the treatment course of neurosurgical patients, and those with a positive COVID-19 infection had a high mortality rate. The reduction in the overall number of cases treated in the neurosurgical service had an impact on the educational and training program. The digital environment found popularity in the educational term; however, digital resources could not replace direct exposure to real patients. The education stakeholders adjusted the undergraduate students' clinical postings and residents' working schemes for safety reasons. CONCLUSIONS The neurosurgery service at an academic tertiary referral hospital in an LMIC experienced a significant reduction in cases. The university and program directors had to adapt to an off-campus and off-hospital policy for neurosurgical residents and undergraduate students. The hospital instituted a reorganization of residents for service. The digital environment found popularity during the outbreak to support the educational process.","Suryaningtyas, Wihasto; Wahyuhadi, Joni; Turchan, Agus; Subagio, Eko Agus; Parenrengi, Muhammad Arifin; Apriawan, Tedy; Al Fauzi, Asra; Bajamal, Abdul Hafid",Neurosurgical focus,https://doi.org/10.3171/2020.9.focus20559; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33260130/,288

Their efforts have been further hampered by the politicization of the pandemic, including media outlets that question the seriousness and necessity of protective actions. The availability of highly politicized news from online platforms has led to concerns about the notion of ""echo chambers,"" whereby users are exposed only to information that conforms to and reinforces their existing beliefs. Using a sample of 5,000 US residents, we explored their information-seeking tendencies, reliance on conservative and liberal online media, risk perceptions, and mitigation behaviors. The results of our study suggest that risk perceptions may vary across preferences for conservative or liberal bias; however, our results do not support differences in the mitigation behavior across patterns of media use. Further, our findings do not support the notion of echo chambers, but rather suggest that people with lower information-seeking behavior may be more strongly influenced by politicized COVID-19 news. Risk estimates converge at higher levels of information seeking, suggesting that high information seekers consume news from sources across the political spectrum. These results are discussed in terms of their theoretical implications for the study of online echo chambers and their practical implications for public health officials and emergency managers.","Lachlan, Kenneth A; Hutter, Emily; Gilbert, Christine",Health security,https://doi.org/10.1089/hs.2020.0176; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33470883/,288
96857,Clinical course and outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in multiple sclerosis patients treated with disease-modifying therapies - the Polish experience.,2021-04-15,"BACKGROUND Since its inception in 2009, transanal minimally invasive surgery has been used increasingly in the United States and internationally as an alternative to local excision and transanal endoscopic microsurgery for local excision of neoplasms in the distal and mid rectum. Despite its increasing acceptance, the clinical benefits of transanal minimally invasive surgery have not yet been validated. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study is to assess the adequacy of transanal minimally invasive surgery for the local excision of benign and malignant lesions of the rectum. DESIGN This is a retrospective analysis of consecutive patients who underwent transanal minimally invasive surgery for local excision of neoplasms at a single institution. SETTINGS The study was conducted by a single group of colorectal surgeons at a tertiary referral center. PATIENTS Eligible patients with early-stage rectal cancer and benign neoplasms were offered transanal minimally invasive surgery as a means for local excision. Data from these patients were collected prospectively in a registry. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome measures included the feasibility of transanal minimally invasive surgery for local excision, resection quality, and short-term clinical results. RESULTS : Fifty patients underwent transanal minimally invasive surgery between July 2009 and December 2011. Twenty-five benign neoplasms, 23 malignant lesions, and 2 neuroendocrine tumors were excised. All lesions were excised using transanal minimally invasive surgery without conversion to an alternate transanal platform. The average length of stay was 0.6 days (range, 0-6), and 68% of patients were discharged on the day of surgery. The average distance from the anal verge was 8.1 cm (range, 3-14 cm). All lesions were excised completely with only 2 fragmented specimens (4%). All specimens were removed with grossly negative margins, although 3 (6%) were found to have microscopically positive margins on final pathology. There were 2 recurrences (4%) at 6- and 18-month follow-up. Early complications occurred in 3 patients (6%). No long-term complications were observed at a median follow-up of 20 months. LIMITATIONS The study was limited by its retrospective nature and midterm follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Transanal minimally invasive surgery is an advanced transanal platform that provides a safe and effective method for resecting benign neoplasms, as well as carefully selected, early-stage malignancies of the mid and distal rectum.","Albert, Matthew R; Atallah, Sam B; deBeche-Adams, Teresa C; Izfar, Seema; Larach, Sergio W",Diseases of the colon and rectum,https://doi.org/10.1097/dcr.0b013e31827ca313; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23392143/,288

Research of insomnia during a pandemic crisis is limited. The aim of the present study was to explore sleep difficulties during the COVID-19 pandemic in a Greek population. The three-day online survey included questions about sociodemographic characteristics, contact with COVID-19 and COVID-19-related negative attitudes, as well as the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), the Intolerance to Uncertainty scale (IUS), the De Jong Gierveld Loneliness scale (JGLS) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) Depression Scale. Altogether, 2,427 individuals participated in the study (with 2,363 of them providing all basic demographic data). Sleep problems were detected in 37.6% of the participants. Women and people in urban areas were more vulnerable to sleep problems, while younger age showed a non-significant trend. Those uncertain about having themselves, or someone close to them contracted the virus, also demonstrated elevated insomnia scores. Lastly, according to the regression analysis, higher levels of intolerance to uncertainty, COVID-19-related worry, loneliness, as well as more severe depressive symptoms, were all predictive of insomnia. Results may be used for the development of therapeutic strategies and implementation of social policies to support people with sleep difficulties.","Voitsidis, Panteleimon; Gliatas, Ioannis; Bairachtari, Vasiliki; Papadopoulou, Kalliopi; Papageorgiou, Georgios; Parlapani, Eleni; Syngelakis, Markos; Holeva, Vasiliki; Diakogiannis, Ioannis",Psychiatry research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113076; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33242799/,288

METHODS In phase 1a of this clinical trial, we assessed the safety, side-effect profile, and pharmacokinetics of TY014, a fully human IgG1 anti-yellow fever virus monoclonal antibody. In a double-blind, phase 1b clinical trial, we assessed the efficacy of TY014, as compared with placebo, in abrogating viremia related to the administration of live yellow fever vaccine (YF17D-204; Stamaril). The primary safety outcomes were adverse events reported 1 hour after the infusion and throughout the trial. The primary efficacy outcome was the dose of TY014 at which 100% of the participants tested negative for viremia within 48 hours after infusion. RESULTS A total of 27 healthy participants were enrolled in phase 1a, and 10 participants in phase 1b. During phase 1a, TY014 dose escalation to a maximum of 20 mg per kilogram of body weight occurred in 22 participants. During phases 1a and 1b, adverse events within 1 hour after infusion occurred in 1 of 27 participants who received TY014 and in none of the 10 participants who received placebo. At least one adverse event occurred during the trial in 22 participants who received TY014 and in 8 who received placebo. The mean half-life of TY014 was approximately 12.8 days. At 48 hours after the infusion, none of the 5 participants who received the starting dose of TY014 of 2 mg per kilogram had detectable YF17D-204 viremia; these participants remained aviremic throughout the trial. Viremia was observed at 48 hours after the infusion in 2 of 5 participants who received placebo and at 72 hours in 2 more placebo recipients. Symptoms associated with yellow fever vaccine were less frequent in the TY014 group than in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS This phase 1 trial of TY014 did not identify worrisome safety signals and suggested potential clinical benefit, which requires further assessment in a phase 2 trial.

The most common travel-related illnesses appear to be gastrointestinal, dermatologic, respiratory, and systemic febrile syndromes. The pretravel medical consultation includes immunizations, malaria chemoprophylaxis, self-treatment for traveler's diarrhea, and advice on the prevention of a myriad of other infectious causes including dengue, chikungunya, rickettsiosis, leptospirosis, schistosomiasis, and strongyloidiasis. Travel to locations experiencing outbreaks such as Ebola virus disease, Middle East respiratory syndrome, avian influenza, and chikungunya call for specific alerts on preventive strategies. After travel, evaluation of an ill traveler must explore details of exposure, including destinations visited; activities; ingestion of contaminated food or drinks; contact with vectors, animals, fresh water, or blood and body fluids; and other potential exposures. Knowledge of the geographic distribution of infectious diseases is important in generating the differential diagnoses and testing accordingly. Empiric treatment is sometimes necessary when suspicion of a certain diagnosis is strong and confirmatory tests are delayed or lacking, particularly for infections that are rapidly progressive (for example, malaria) or for which timing of testing is prolonged (such as leptospirosis).","Chen, Lin H; Blair, Barbra M",Microbiology spectrum,https://doi.org/10.1128/microbiolspec.iol5-0005-2015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26350325/,288
111277,"Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in Patients with Severe Pneumonia in Khuzestan Province, Iran.",2020-10-18,"BACKGROUND In natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES), the endoscope has the disadvantages of an unstable visual field and wide blind space. We developed a compact charge-coupled device (CCD) camera unit that can be transgastrointestinally placed in the abdominal cavity. METHODS The requisites for a wireless CCD camera unit for use in NOTES have been cited as: monitoring performance, fixation to the abdominal wall, attitude control, and antifogging functionality. Models to meet these requisites were prepared to assess their performance. The monitor had a CCD with dimensions of 7 x 7 x 7 mm and resolution of 410,000 pixels. The unit had a structure that allowed its attachment to the endoscope apex when placed to the abdominal wall. The abdominal wall fixation unit was equipped with a pantograph-type needle structure that was easily activated and retained by changing the polarity of an electromagnetic force. The pantograph-type needle head was designed to rotate by 360 degrees as an attitude-control mechanism, and both the pantograph and attitude-control mechanisms enabled attitude control in horizontal and vertical directions by a magnetic force applied from outside the body. Fogging was prevented by a vibration mechanism that physically cleaned the CCD lens surface and by titanium dioxide coating of the lens surface. RESULTS The CCD camera unit was confirmed to have sufficient performance as an auxiliary monitor for endoscopy in terms of visual field and resolution. The pantograph-type needle structure successfully completed fixation of the CCD camera unit to the abdominal wall. Unit attitude was easily controlled, and fogging could be addressed by water supply before insertion of the CCD camera unit into the peritoneal cavity. CONCLUSIONS The wireless CCD camera unit was verified to function as an effective second eye in NOTES by using the described mechanisms and antifogging coating.","Ohdaira, Takeshi; Endo, Kazuhiro; Abe, Nozomi; Yasuda, Yoshikazu",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-009-0554-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19533239/,288

Male Wistar rats were divided into 5 groups. Except for the control group, CORT (40 mg per kg·bw) was injected subcutaneously for 21 consecutive days to induce testicular toxicity. 1 h before CORT injection, the rats were treated with EEM (400 mg per kg·bw) and M 18:3 (5 mg per kg·bw, 25 mg per kg·bw) by gavage, except for the control group and model group. Epididymal sperm and biochemical, and histological parameters were evaluated for the protective effects of the drugs. EEM (400 mg per kg·bw) and M 18:3 (5 mg per kg·bw, 25 mg per kg·bw) increased the sperm concentration and sperm motility, decreased the production of abnormal sperms, and increased the number of spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes in the seminiferous tubules of CORT-induced rats. Moreover, EEM and M 18:3 decreased the MDA levels and the positive expression rates of TUNEL, whereas they increased the activities of SOD, CAT, GSH-Px, and GST, and the contents of GSH in the testicles of CORT-induced rats. Furthermore, EEM and M 18:3 alleviated CORT-induced reduction in the positive expression rates of PCNA and Ki67 in the testicles of rats. Besides, EEM and M 18:3 reduced the expression levels of Keap-1 and increased the expression levels of Nrf2, HO-1, γ-GCS, and NQO1 in the testicles of CORT-induced rats. In summary, the protective effects of EEM and M 18:3 may be attributed to their anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic properties.","Yu, Zejun; Liu, Hao; Li, Dong; Chen, Xuemin; Ao, Mingzhang; Jin, Wenwen; Yu, Longjiang",Food & function,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0fo00890g; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32797129/,288

Non-invasive measurement of SaO₂ by commercial pulse oximeters (SpO₂) make use of photoplethysmographic pulses in the red and infrared regions and utilizes the different spectra of light absorption by oxygenated and de-oxygenated hemoglobin. Because light scattering and optical path-lengths differ between the two wavelengths, commercial pulse oximeters require empirical calibration which is based on SaO₂ measurement in extracted arterial blood. They are still prone to error, because the path-lengths difference between the two wavelengths varies among different subjects. We have developed modified pulse oximetry, which makes use of two nearby infrared wavelengths that have relatively similar scattering constants and path-lengths and does not require an invasive calibration step. In measurements performed on adults during breath holding, the two-infrared pulse oximeter and a commercial pulse oximeter showed similar changes in SpO₂. The two pulse oximeters showed similar accuracy when compared to SaO₂ measurement in extracted arterial blood (the gold standard) performed in intensive care units on newborns and children with an arterial line. Errors in SpO₂ because of variability in path-lengths difference between the two wavelengths are expected to be smaller in the two-infrared pulse oximeter.","Yossef Hay, Ohad; Cohen, Meir; Nitzan, Itamar; Kasirer, Yair; Shahroor-Karni, Sarit; Yitzhaky, Yitzhak; Engelberg, Shlomo; Nitzan, Meir",Sensors,https://doi.org/10.3390/s18103457; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30326552/,288

SARS first surfaced as a pandemic in late 2002 and originated in southern China. SARS-CoV rapidly spread to > 30 countries by 2003, infecting nearly 8,000 people and causing around 800 fatalities. After 10 years of silence, a 2012 report alarmed researchers about the emergence of a new strain of CoV causing SARS-like disease. AREAS COVERED To combat SARS, scientists applied for patents on various therapeutic agents, including small-molecule inhibitors targeting the essential proteases, helicase and other proteins of the virus, natural products, approved drugs, molecules binding to the virus, neutralizing antibodies, vaccines, anti-sense RNA, siRNA and ribozyme against SARS-CoV. In this article, the patents published from 2008 to the present for the new therapeutics that could potentially be used in the prophylaxis and treatment of SARS are reviewed. EXPERT OPINION The therapeutic interventions or prophylaxis discussed in this review seems to offer promising solutions to tackle SARS. Rather than being complacent about the results, we should envisage how to transform them into drug candidates that may be useful in combating SARS and related viral infections in the future.","Kumar, Vathan; Jung, Young-Sik; Liang, Po-Huang",Expert opinion on therapeutic patents,https://doi.org/10.1517/13543776.2013.823159; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23905913/,288

Continuing to deliver time-critical surgical care is important to avoid excess morbidity and mortality from pathologies unrelated to COVID-19. We describe the implementation and short-term surgical outcomes from a system to deliver time-critical elective surgical care to patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS A protocol for the prioritisation and safe delivery of time-critical surgery at a COVID-19 'clean' site was implemented at the Nuffield Health Exeter Hospital, an independent sector hospital in the southwest of England. Outcomes to 30 days postoperatively were recorded, including unplanned admissions after daycase surgery, readmissions and complications, as well as the incidence of perioperative COVID-19 infection in patients and staff. RESULTS A total of 128 surgical procedures were performed during a 31-day period by a range of specialties including breast, plastics, urology, gynaecology, vascular and cardiology. There was one unplanned admission and and two readmissions. Six complications were identified, and all were Clavien-Dindo grade 1 or 2. All 128 patients had preoperative COVID-19 swabs, one of which was positive and the patient had their surgery delayed. Ten patients were tested for COVID-19 postoperatively, with none testing positive. CONCLUSION This study has demonstrated the implementation of a safe system for delivery of time-critical elective surgical care at a COVID-19 clean site. Other healthcare providers may benefit from implementation of similar methodology as hospitals plan to restart elective surgery.","Burden, E G; Walker, R W; Ferguson, D J; Goubran, Amf; Howell, J R; John, J B; Khan, F; McGrath, J S; Evans, J P",Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England,https://doi.org/10.1308/rcsann.2020.7023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33557703/,288

It has been proposed as a noninvasive alternative to pulse pressure variation (PPV) used in the prediction of the response to volume expansion in hypovolemic patients. We considered a number of simple techniques for better determining the underlying relationship between the two parameters. It was shown numerically that baseline-induced signal errors were asymmetric in nature, which corresponded to observation, and we proposed a method which combines a least-median-of-squares estimator with the requirement that the relationship passes through the origin (the LMSO method). We further developed a method of normalization of the parameters through rescaling DPOP using the inverse gradient of the linear fitted relationship. We propose that this normalization method (LMSO-N) is applicable to the matching of a wide range of clinical parameters. It is also generally applicable to the self-normalizing of parameters whose behaviour may change slightly due to algorithmic improvements.","Addison, Paul S; Wang, Rui; Uribe, Alberto A; Bergese, Sergio D",Computational and mathematical methods in medicine,https://doi.org/10.1155/2015/576340; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25691912/,288

Longitudinal evaluation was possible in 17 participants. Thirty-seven participants (77%) reported an important improvement in mobility (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 63-87%). An important reduction in pain was reported by 35 participants (73%; 95% CI 59-83%). CRPS-I recurred in 4 of 47 participants (9%; 95% CI 3-20%), once in the residual limb and 3 times in another limb. Of the 35 participants fitted with a lower limb prosthesis, 24 were still using the prosthesis. Longitudinal evaluation showed no significant deteriorations. CONCLUSION Amputation can be considered as a treatment for patients with long-standing, therapy-resistant CRPS-I. Amputation can increase mobility and reduce pain, thereby improving the quality of patients' lives. However, approximately one-quarter of participants reported deteriorations in intimacy and self-confidence after the amputation.","Geertzen, Jan H B; Scheper, Jelmer; Schrier, Ernst; Dijkstra, Pieter U",Journal of rehabilitation medicine,https://doi.org/10.2340/16501977-2718; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32735019/,288

PROCEDURES We enrolled patients who underwent thermal ablation for HCC in our hospital from April 2004 to April 2017. Radiomics based on two branch convolution recurrent network was utilized to analyze preoperative dynamic CEUS image of HCC lesions to establish CEUS model, in comparison to the conventional ultrasound (US), clinical, and combined models. Clinical follow-up of HCC recurrence after ablation were taken as reference standard to evaluate the predicted performance of CEUS model and other models. RESULTS We finally analyzed 318 patients (training cohort: test cohort = 255:63). The combined model showed better performance for early recurrence than CUES (in training cohort, AUC, 0.89 vs. 0.84, P < 0.001; in test cohort, AUC, 0.84 vs. 0.83, P = 0.272), US (P < 0.001), or clinical model (P < 0.001). For late recurrence prediction, the combined model showed the best performance than the CEUS (C-index, in training cohort, 0.77 vs. 0.76, P = 0.009; in test cohort, 0.77 vs. 0.68, P < 0.001), US (P < 0.001), or clinical model (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The CEUS model based on dynamic CEUS radiomics performed well in predicting early HCC recurrence after ablation. The combined model combining CEUS, US radiomics, and clinical factors could stratify the high risk of late recurrence.","Ma, Qiu-Ping; He, Xue-Lei; Li, Kai; Wang, Jin-Fen; Zeng, Qing-Jing; Xu, Er-Jiao; He, Xu-Qi; Li, Shuo-Yang; Kun, Wang; Zheng, Rong-Qin; Tian, Jei",Molecular imaging and biology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11307-021-01578-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33483803/,288

However, no study has examined closed POD recruitment strategies or approaches to determine best practices, such as how to select or recruit an agency, group, or business to become a closed POD site once a potential partner has been identified. We conducted qualitative interviews with US disaster planners to identify their approaches and challenges to recruiting closed POD sites. In total, 16 disaster planners participated. Recruitment considerations related to selecting sites, paperwork needed, and challenges faced in recruiting closed POD sites. Important selection criteria for sites included size, agencies or businesses with vulnerable or confined populations who lack access or ability to get to or through open POD sites, and critical infrastructure organizations. Major challenges to recruitment included difficulty convincing sites of closed POD importance, obstacles with recruiting sites that can administer mass vaccination, and fear of legal repercussions related to medical countermeasure dispensing or administration. Closed POD recruitment is a frequently challenging but highly necessary process both before and during the current pandemic. These recommendations can be used by other disaster planners intending to start or expand their closed POD network. Public health agencies should continue working toward improved distribution plans for medical countermeasures, both oral and vaccine, to minimize morbidity and mortality during mass casualty events.","Rebmann, Terri; Foerst, Kyle; Charney, Rachel L; Sandcork, Jessica; Mazzara, Rachel L",Health security,https://doi.org/10.1089/hs.2020.0219; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33826857/,288

It is generally acknowledged it is the mutations that have caused the virulence attenuation of vaccine strain, but lack of sufficient experimental evidences. For a better understanding of the mechanism of attenuation of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), in this study, we assessed whether prM/E is critical neurovirulence determinants of JEV with infectious cDNA clones technique. Substitutions prM/E of vaccine strain with that of WT SA14 did significantly increase the virulence of JEV to the similar level of wild type SA14, and simultaneously, replacement prM/E of JEV WT strain SA14 with that of vaccine strain SA14-14-2 decreased the virulence of JEV significantly to the similar level of vaccine stain. The results indicate that the prM/E protein is the crucial virulence determinant of Japanese encephalitis virus, although other proteins take part in the process to some extent.","Leng, Sheng-Ling; Huang, Rong; Feng, Ya-Nan; Peng, Li-Juan; Yang, Jian; Li, Yu-Hua",Microbial pathogenesis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2020.104492; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32916243/,288
134263,Respiratory failure in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.,2020-05-14,"Melioidosis, caused by the Gram-negative bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, is a major cause of sepsis and mortality in endemic regions of Southeast Asia and Northern Australia. B. pseudomallei is a potential bioterrorism agent due to its high infectivity, especially via inhalation, and its inherent resistance to antimicrobials. There is currently no vaccine for melioidosis and antibiotic treatment can fail due to innate drug resistance, delayed diagnosis and treatment, or insufficient duration of treatment. A well-characterized animal model that mimics human melioidosis is needed for the development of new medical countermeasures. This study first characterized the disease progression of melioidosis in the African green monkey (AGM) and rhesus macaque (RM) for non-human primate model down-selection. All AGMs developed acute lethal disease similar to that described in human acute infection following exposure to aerosolized B. pseudomallei strain HBPUB10134a. Only 20% of RMs succumbed to acute disease. Disease progression, immune response and pathology of two other strains of B. pseudomallei, K96243 and MSHR5855, were also compared using AGMs. These three B. pseudomallei strains represent a highly virulent strain from Thailand (HBPUB101034a), a highly virulent strains from Australia (MSHR5855), and a commonly used laboratory strains originating from Thailand (K96243). Animals were observed for clinical signs of infection and blood samples were analyzed for cytokine responses, blood chemistry and leukocyte changes in order to characterize bacterial infection. AGMs experienced fever with aerosolized B. pseudomallei at the onset of acute disease. Inflammation, abscesses and/or pyogranulomas were observed in lung with all three strains of B. pseudomallei. Inflammation, abscesses and/or pyogranulomas were observed in lymph nodes, spleen, liver and/or kidney with B. pseudomallei, HBPUB10134a and K96243. Additionally, the Australian strain MSHR5855 induced brain lesions in one AGM similar to clinical cases of melioidosis seen in Australia. Elevated serum levels of IL-1β, IL-1 receptor antagonist, IL-6, MCP-1, G-CSF, HGF, IFNγ, MIG, I-TAC, and MIP-1β at terminal end points can be significantly correlated with non-survivors with B. pseudomallei infection in AGM. The AGM model represents an acute model of B. pseudomallei infection for all three strains from two geographical locations and will be useful for efficacy testing of vaccines and therapeutics against melioidosis. In summary, a dysregulated immune response leading to excessive persistent inflammation and inflammatory cell death is the key driver of acute melioidosis. Early intervention in these pathways will be necessary to counter B. pseudomallei and mitigate the pathological consequences of melioidosis.","Trevino, Sylvia R; Dankmeyer, Jennifer L; Fetterer, David P; Klimko, Christopher P; Raymond, Jo Lynne W; Moreau, Alicia M; Soffler, Carl; Waag, David M; Worsham, Patricia L; Amemiya, Kei; Ruiz, Sara I; Cote, Christopher K; Krakauer, Teresa",PLoS neglected tropical diseases,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0009125; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33571211/,288

In this study, it was aimed to investigate the effects of CT on the age of onset (AoO) and clinical features of the disease by considering factors such as family history, head trauma, birth trauma, alcohol and substance abuse that may affect AoO of the disease. METHODS The sample comprising 200 patients admitted to the outpatient and inpatient care at the Izmir Katip Çelebi University, Atatürk Education and Research Hospital psychiatry clinic, were included in the study. Socio-demographic information form, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form (CTQ-SF) and subscale of Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) were applied. RESULTS All types of trauma, except physical abuse, were found related to the disease onset age earlier. It was also detected that the factors of head trauma, birth complication, presence of an individual diagnosed with schizophrenia in the family and migration history were not related to AoO of the disease. On the other hand, it was found that physical, emotional and sexual abuses lead to more positive psychotic symptoms, and all types of CT increase the severity of disease and the risk of suicide. CONCLUSION This study draws attention to the etiological importance of CT in schizophrenia as an environmental factor by showing that it affects AoO of the disease along with symptomatology. Future studies should focus on the pathogenesis of CT in schizophrenia and the interaction between CT and biological and genetic predisposition.","İngeç, Cem; Evren Kılıçaslan, Esin",The International journal of social psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1177/0020764020943629; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32701048/,288

PURPOSE To retrospectively compare the short-term radiological and clinical outcomes of RFA under combined ultrasound (US) and computed tomography (CT) guidance with that of a previously performed US-guided series at the same institution. MATERIAL AND METHODS From November 2009 to November 2013, 60 patients (mean age, 70.1 years; range, 34-86 years) with renal masses measuring in the range of 13-50 mm in maximal diameter (mean diameter, 25.4 ± 6.8 mm) underwent percutaneous RFA with combined US/CT guidance. The technical success rate, recurrence-free survival, rate of complications, and the percentage change in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were compared with that of a previously published series of 41 patients with SRM treated with US-guided RFA between November 2002 and December 2008. RESULTS The tumor and patient characteristics were similar between the two treatment groups. The primary and secondary technical success rate was significantly higher in the group treated with combined US/CT guidance compared with the group treated with US guidance alone (100% and 100% vs. 82% and 91%, respectively). The local recurrence-free survival was significantly better in the combined US/CT-guided group than in the US-guided group (P = 0.016). There was no significant difference in the rate of overall complications (13% vs. 17%) or the mean percentage decrease in the eGFR after the respective treatment (1.1 ± 18.3% vs. 5.0 ± 11.7%).

Considering that the most underprivileged population disproportionately suffers with the reduction in dental care provision, the study hypothesis suggests the presence of a syndemic nature. METHODOLOGY The SUS Outpatient Information System (SIA-SUS) was assessed to gather data on dental care activities and procedures performed between April and July 2018, 2019, and 2020 by dentists registered in the SUS. The 30 most frequent activities and procedures performed by dentists were selected and classified into three categories (urgent dental care, nonemergency dental care, and case-dependent urgency procedures), based on the guidance for dental care during the pandemic published by the American Dental Association. RESULTS Results demonstrated a reduction in the provision of dental care of all categories during the pandemic. Urgency dental consultations and procedures in primary and specialized dental care services decreased by 42.5 and 44.1%, respectively, between 2020 and 2019. Non-urgent procedures decreased by 92.3%. Although decreases in dental care activities and procedures were reported in all Brazilian regions, the largest relative decreases in urgent procedures - that should have been maintained during the pandemic - occurred in the North and Northeast regions, which are the poorest regions of the country. CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic has a syndemic behavior. Further investigation into the pandemic-syndemic impacts on oral disease burden is necessary.","Cunha, Amanda Ramos da; Velasco, Sofia Rafaela Maito; Hugo, Fernando Neves; Antunes, José Leopoldo Ferreira",Revista brasileira de epidemiologia = Brazilian journal of epidemiology,https://doi.org/10.1590/1980-549720210028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34076147/,288

Our scoping review addresses this gap by examining how the body of research on ASRH in SSA has evolved over the past decade, and its present profile, in terms of trends in volume, geographic and substantive focus, and Africa-led inquiry. METHODS We used a three-step search strategy to identify English and French peer-reviewed publications and relevant grey literature on ASRH in SSA published between January 2010 and December 2019. Two reviewers screened the titles, abstracts and full texts of publications for eligibility and inclusion. RESULTS A total of 1302 articles were published over the period, rising from 91 in 2010 to 183 in 2015. However, the bulk of the studies (63.9%) focused on six (South Africa, Kenya, Nigeria, Tanzania, Uganda and Ethiopia) of the 46 SSA countries. Ten countries had no ASRH papers, while five others each had only one publication. While issues like HIV (17.2%), sexual behaviours (17.4%) and access to sexual and reproductive health services (13.0%) received substantial attention, only a few studies focused on early adolescence (10-14 years), programme interventions, scaling up of interventions and policy evaluation. Just over half of publications had authors with African institutional affiliations as first authors (51.1%) or last author (53.0%). Sixteen per cent of papers did not include any authors from institutions in Africa. CONCLUSIONS Our review demonstrated that research on ASRH is limited in focus and is unevenly distributed across SSA countries. The identified gaps can guide future research and funding to advance ASRH policies and programmes. It is also vital for stakeholders in the research enterprise, including researchers, donors, ethical review boards, and journal editors and reviewers, to implement measures that foster national investigators' inclusion.","Ajayi, Anthony Idowu; Otukpa, Emmanuel Oloche; Mwoka, Meggie; Kabiru, Caroline W; Ushie, Boniface Ayanbekongshie",BMJ global health,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2020-004129; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33568395/,288

In an effort to reduce chronic pain, a semiresorbable, lighter and self-gripping mesh was developed. METHODS A double-blind randomized clinical trial was conducted comparing the self-gripping mesh with a standard polypropylene mesh repair. Patients over 18 years of age undergoing open primary hernia repair were included. Pain was measured on a six-point verbal rating scale (VRS) and a 150-mm visual analogue scale (VAS). Postoperative pain reduction from baseline pain (ΔVAS), complications and return to work/hobbies were studied. Data were collected at baseline, 3 weeks, 3 months and 1 year after surgery (primary outcome). RESULTS A total of 363 patients were analysed. Median age was 59 (range 19-88) years. Baseline VRS and VAS scores were similar for the two groups. There was no difference in VRS scores at 1-year follow-up. Duration of surgery was significantly shorter with the self-gripping mesh (mean 40 min versus 49 min for standard mesh repair; P < 0·001). At 3 weeks, ΔVAS in patients receiving the self-gripping mesh was significantly larger (-10·6 versus -5·0 respectively; P = 0·049) and less subjective discomfort was reported (P = 0·016). Complication rates, return to work and recurrence rates were similar, although there were more recurrences in the self-gripping mesh group (5·5 versus 2·2 per cent; P = 0·103). CONCLUSION A self-gripping mesh for hernia repair may result in less pain in the early postoperative phase but chronic postherniorraphy pain is not affected. Recurrence rates may be a potential disadvantage.

This study aimed to obtain a more detailed understanding of the current mental health needs of these individuals, which is important for both the development of intervention strategies to better manage patient distress and to better prepare for similar circumstances in future. METHODS The sample comprised 43 individuals with a verified diagnosis of BD and 24 healthy controls. Data about pandemic-related mental health support use, socio-demographics, mood, lifestyle, social rhythm and subjective cognitive dysfunction data were collected and compared between groups. Inter-relationships between scores were also examined. RESULTS No between-group differences were found in terms of age, sex, living situation, job loss or reduced work hours due to COVID-19. Most patients with BD reported a history of ongoing formal psychological support (68.3%), with most continuing this support throughout the pandemic (82.1%). A large, statistically significant pandemic-related increase in subjective cognitive dysfunction was evident in the BD group. Subjective cognitive dysfunction was significantly associated with negative symptomology, suicidal thoughts, and quality of life ratings. LIMITATIONS Data was collected in self-report format in an online survey and objective symptom measures were not used at this time CONCLUSION: The absenceof substantial differences between patients and controls in terms of mood symptoms, COVID-19 fear or lifestyle factors and social rhythms suggests a degree of resilience in BD patients; despite large pandemic related increases in subjective cognitive dysfunction.","Karantonis, James A; Rossell, Susan L; Berk, Michael; Van Rheenen, Tamsyn E",Journal of affective disorders,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.186; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33422820/,288
154240,[Mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of COVID-19-progress and challenges].,2020-10-25,"Some maternal infections, contracted before or during pregnancy, can be transmitted to the fetus, during gestation (congenital infection), during labor and childbirth (perinatal infection) and through breastfeeding (postnatal infection). The agents responsible for these infections can be viruses, bacteria, protozoa, fungi. Among the viruses most frequently responsible for congenital infections are Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Herpes simplex 1-2, Herpes virus 6, Varicella zoster. Moreover Hepatitis B and C virus, HIV, Parvovirus B19 and non-polio Enteroviruses when contracted during pregnancy may involve the fetus or newborn at birth. Recently, new viruses have emerged, SARS-Cov-2 and Zika virus, of which we do not yet fully know the characteristics and pathogenic power when contracted during pregnancy. Viral infections in pregnancy can damage the fetus (spontaneous abortion, fetal death, intrauterine growth retardation) or the newborn (congenital anomalies, organ diseases with sequelae of different severity). Some risk factors specifically influence the incidence of transmission to the fetus: the timing of the infection in pregnancy, the order of the infection, primary or reinfection or chronic, the duration of membrane rupture, type of delivery, socio-economic conditions and breastfeeding. Frequently infected neonates, symptomatic at birth, have worse outcomes than asymptomatic. Many asymptomatic babies develop long term neurosensory outcomes. The way in which the virus interacts with the maternal immune system, the maternal-fetal interface and the placenta explain these results and also the differences that are observed from time to time in the fetal-neonatal outcomes of maternal infections. The maternal immune system undergoes functional adaptation during pregnancy, once thought as physiological immunosuppression. This adaptation, crucial for generating a balance between maternal immunity and fetus, is necessary to promote and support the pregnancy itself and the growth of the fetus. When this adaptation is upset by the viral infection, the balance is broken, and the infection can spread and lead to the adverse outcomes previously described. In this review we will describe the main viral harmful infections in pregnancy and the potential mechanisms of the damages on the fetus and newborn.","Auriti, Cinzia; De Rose, Domenico Umberto; Santisi, Alessandra; Martini, Ludovica; Piersigilli, Fiammetta; Bersani, Iliana; Ronchetti, Maria Paola; Caforio, Leonardo",Biochimica et biophysica acta.

157421,"Thoughts of death, depression, and guilt in a healthcare worker who infected her husband with SARS-CoV-2: A case report.",2020-12-23,"In recent years, several paramyxoviruses have emerged to infect humans, including previously unidentified zoonoses. Hendra and Nipah viruses (henipaviruses within this family) were first identified in the 1990s in Australia, Malaysia and Singapore, causing epidemics with high mortality and morbidity rates in affected animals and humans. Other paramyxoviruses, such as Menangle virus, Tioman virus, human metapneumovirus and avian paramyxovirus 1, which cause less morbidity in humans, have also been recently identified. Although the Paramyxoviridae family of viruses has been previously recognised as biomedically and veterinarily important, the recent emergence of these paramyxoviruses has focused our attention on this family. Antiviral drugs can be designed to target specific important determinants of the viral life cycle. Therefore, identifying and understanding the mechanistic underpinnings of viral entry, replication, assembly and budding will be critical in the development of antiviral therapeutic agents. This review focuses on the molecular mechanisms discovered and the antiviral strategies pursued in recent years for emerging paramyxoviruses, with particular emphasis on viral entry and exit mechanisms.","Aguilar, Hector C; Lee, Benhur",Expert reviews in molecular medicine,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1462399410001754; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21345285/,288
157772,Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition attenuates lipopolysaccharide-induced lung injury by regulating the balance between angiotensin-converting enzyme and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and inhibiting mitogen-activated protein kinase activation.,2015,"Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are viral pathogens that cause epidemics and occasional pandemics of significant mortality. The generation of efficacious vaccines and antiviral drugs remains a challenge due to the rapid appearance of new influenza virus types and antigenic variants. Consequently, novel strategies for the prevention and treatment of IAV infections are needed, given the limitations of the presently available antivirals. Here, we used enzymatically produced IAV-specific double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules and Giardia intestinalis Dicer for the generation of a swarm of small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules. The siRNAs target multiple conserved genomic regions of the IAVs. In mammalian cells, the produced 25- to 27-nucleotide-long siRNA molecules are processed by endogenous Dicer into 21-nucleotide siRNAs and are thus designated Dicer-substrate siRNAs (DsiRNAs). We evaluated the efficacy of the above DsiRNA swarm at preventing IAV infections in human primary monocyte-derived macrophages and dendritic cells. The replication of different IAV strains, including avian influenza H5N1 and H7N9 viruses, was significantly inhibited by pretransfection of the cells with the IAV-specific DsiRNA swarm. Up to 7 orders of magnitude inhibition of viral RNA expression was observed, which led to a dramatic inhibition of IAV protein synthesis and virus production. The IAV-specific DsiRNA swarm inhibited virus replication directly through the RNA interference pathway although a weak induction of innate interferon responses was detected. Our results provide direct evidence for the feasibility of the siRNA strategy and the potency of DsiRNA swarms in the prevention and treatment of influenza, including the highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses.IMPORTANCE In spite of the enormous amount of research, influenza virus is still one of the major challenges for medical virology due to its capacity to generate new variants, which potentially lead to severe epidemics and pandemics. We demonstrated here that a swarm of small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules, including more than 100 different antiviral RNA molecules targeting the most conserved regions of the influenza A virus genome, could efficiently inhibit the replication of all tested avian and seasonal influenza A variants in human primary monocyte-derived macrophages and dendritic cells. The wide antiviral spectrum makes the virus-specific siRNA swarm a potentially efficient treatment modality against both avian and seasonal influenza viruses.","Jiang, Miao; Österlund, Pamela; Westenius, Veera; Guo, Deyin; Poranen, Minna M; Bamford, Dennis H; Julkunen, Ilkka",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01916-18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30463970/,288
158579,Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Responses and Seroconversion in COVID-19 Patients Using Twelve Commercial Immunoassays.,2021-11-01,"INTRODUCTION Cancer patients with Covid-19 are exposed to treatment combinations that can potentially result in interactions that adversely affect patient outcomes. This study aimed to identify potential drug-drug interactions between antineoplastic agents and medicines used to treat Covid-19. METHODS We conducted a search for potential interactions between 201 antineoplastic agents and 26 medicines used to treat Covid-19 on the Lexicomp® and Micromedex® databases. The following data were extracted: interaction severity (""major"" and ""contraindicated"") and interaction effects (pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic). We also sought to identify the therapeutic indication of the antineoplastic drugs involved in the potential drug-drug interactions. RESULTS A total of 388 ""major"" or ""contraindicated"" drug-drug interactions were detected. Eight drugs or combinations (baricitinib, lopinavir/ritonavir, atazanavir, darunavir, azithromycin, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and sirolimus) accounted for 91.5% of these interactions. The class of antineoplastic agents with the greatest potential for interaction was tyrosine kinase inhibitors (accounting for 46.4% of all interactions). The findings show that atazanavir, baricitinib, and lopinavir/ritonavir can affect the treatment of all common types of cancer. The most common pharmacokinetic effect of the potential drug-drug interactions was increased plasma concentration of the antineoplastic medicine (39.4%). CONCLUSIONS Covid-19 is a recent disease and pharmacological interventions are undergoing constant modification. This study identified a considerable number of potential drug-drug interactions. In view of the vulnerability of patients with cancer, it is vital that health professionals carefully assess the risks and benefits of drug combinations.","Sobreira da Silva, Mario Jorge; Serpa Osorio-de-Castro, Claudia Garcia; Paes, Rafael Duarte; Negrete, Christopher Lucas; Eugênio, Elizangela; Moraes, Elaine Lazzaroni; Livinalli, Annemeri",Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,https://doi.org/10.1177/10781552211040494; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34637360/,288

Establishing effective methods to concentrate and purify viral genomes prior to sequencing is essential for high quality viromes. Using virus spike-and-recovery experiments, we stepwise compared two common approaches for virus concentration, ultrafiltration and iron chloride flocculation, across diverse matrices: wastewater influent, wastewater secondary effluent, river water, and seawater. Viral DNA was purified by removing cellular DNA via chloroform cell lysis, filtration, and enzymatic degradation of extra-viral DNA. We found that viral genomes were concentrated 1-2 orders of magnitude more with ultrafiltration than iron chloride flocculation for all matrices and resulted in higher quality DNA suitable for amplification-free and long-read sequencing. Given its widespread use and utility as an inexpensive field method for virome sampling, we nonetheless sought to optimize iron flocculation. We found viruses were best concentrated in seawater with 5-fold higher iron concentrations than the standard used, inhibition of DNase activity reduced purification effectiveness, and five-fold more iron was needed to flocculate viruses from freshwater than seawater—critical knowledge for those seeking to apply this broadly used method to freshwater virome samples. Overall, our results demonstrated that ultrafiltration and purification performed better than iron chloride flocculation and purification in the tested matrices. Given that the method performance depended on the solids content and salinity of the samples, we suggest spike-and-recovery experiments be applied when concentrating and purifying sample types that diverge from those tested here. Importance Viruses in diverse habitats numerically dominate microbial community members and are consequential for host fate and responsible for disease outbreaks. Metagenomics has provided novel insights into their presence, diversity, and ecosystem impacts. Yet the approach is hindered by the challenge that, despite their numbers, viral genomes comprise a minor portion of total community DNA in a sample. To comprehensively describe a viral community with metagenomics, viral genomes must be effectively concentrated and purified to capture low abundance and rare viruses amidst the overwhelming presence of cellular genomic DNA. We evaluated two commonly applied methods for concentrating and purifying viral DNA, ultrafiltration and iron chloride flocculation, across four aquatic sample types that differ in their solids content and salinity. Our findings demonstrated the importance of sample characteristics for method effectivity and provided performance measures for a variety of matrices. These findings contribute a more comprehensive understanding of the impacts of virome sample preparation across diverse matrices and are thus important for guiding future virome studies, given the wide range of habitats in which viruses are studied.","Langenfeld, Kathryn; Chin, Kaitlyn; Wigginton, Krista R.; Duhaime, Melissa B.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.26.356501,288

At UHCW we proposed that specialist physicians without recent general medicine experience could be safely and effectively redeployed to support the acute medical take.A rota of consultant physicians from 8 medical specialties, who did not participate in the acute medical take, was developed at pace to work alongside the medical registrar, in the segregated respiratory area of ED, following limited training. Two shifts were implemented within 6 days of inception, fitted around doctors’ ongoing specialty roles.We gained feedback iteratively during the early phases. We then used a survey of all those asked to redeploy to explore their lived experiences and perceptions, with a 71% response rate.Median time since consultants had participated in an unselected medical take was 12 years. 66% were not GIM accredited. 84% found the online training useful. Many had concerns regarding availability of PPE and the risk of passing infection on to others, including their own vulnerable patients. 81% described concerns around personal competence.63% of respondents felt this redeployment had made a positive difference to the COVID-19 response. However, 57% felt other groups should have been redeployed before them, and 45% reported they would not agree to be redeployed in a repeat scenario. Transparency regarding who was redeployed and equity amongst all physicians were the most important factors influencing decisions on future redeployment.We rapidly implemented a consultant redeployment programme during the pandemic, and redeployed doctors felt they made a positive difference. However, the same staff group may not willingly be redeployed during any future emergency.

A fundamental risk may emerge from misconceptions about the sensitivity of such data, as well as the agency of individuals to protect their privacy when fine-grained (and possibly involuntary) behavior is tracked. In this work, we examine how individuals adjust their behavior when incentivized to avoid the algorithmic prediction of their intent. We present results from a virtual reality task in which gaze, movement, and other physiological signals are tracked. Participants are asked to decide which card to select without an algorithmic adversary anticipating their choice. We find that while participants use a variety of strategies, data collected remains highly predictive of choice (80% accuracy). Additionally, a significant portion of participants became more predictable despite efforts to obfuscate, possibly indicating mistaken priors about the dynamics of algorithmic prediction.","Gordon, Jeremy; Curran, Max; Chuang, John; Cheshire, Coye",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.00771v1.pdf,288
165326,"The Specchio-COVID19 cohort study: a longitudinal follow-up of SARS-CoV-2 serosurvey participants in the canton of Geneva, Switzerland (Study protocol)",2021-07-16,"The usage of digital currencies and digital payments such as cryptocurrencies and card payments have been rapidly increased during Covid-19 pandemic because of providing contactless payments and keeping social distance between individuals. The number of contactless payments users was 440 million before the Covid-19 period, then the number of users increased rapidly and reached around 760 million in 2020 (Statista, 2021). In this regard, this paper investigates the perspectives of businesses regarding the usage of a local digital currency and its payment methods. Moreover, this paper investigates the incentives or supports that businesses might provide for their workers or customers to increase the usage of this currency. The researchers adopted a case study and performed structured interviews with the experts. Moreover, they also applied a non-probability sampling method, purposive sampling since this method is applied by researchers when aiming to explore a specific issue and intentionally selecting the extreme examples. In this regard, the researchers deliberately chose 25 businesses that operate in a disadvantaged region, namely, Cieszyn Silesia where a prospective local currency implementation can be applied by practitioners to overcome the negative economic outcomes of Covid-19. Since digital local currencies make significant contributions on economic conditions of disadvantaged regions, selecting respondents that have minimum 10 years experiences in businesses of a disadvantaged region makes this paper to fulfil the research aims. The researchers have also prior knowledge about this topic, and this is another reason of employing this sampling method. The researchers collected both qualitative and quantitative data and this paper is a kind of descriptive research. The researchers just indicated the result by accumulating the responses in Microsoft Excel and stating the responses that the survey participants answered for open-ended questions. According to the results, all businesses are prone to use digital currencies and are interested in accepting digital payments with these currencies. Regarding supports, businesses have willingness to provide bonuses and incentives to their employees, and customers to increase the usage of these currencies. These results might provide strong evidences to implement a digital local currency under the conditions of Covid-19 pandemic in a disadvantaged region. © 2021, Czestochowa University of Technology.

While the general approach to Taiwan?s success in keeping the virus out is historical, stating the policy lessons learned from previous anti-pandemic experience, the study focuses on how these coping strategies were able to be made and conducted with little disruption from misinformation and conspiracy theories. Inspired by Sheila Jasanoff?s notion of how science and technology are received through different political and policy systems, and by Bruno Latour?s semiotic reflections on the actor-network theory, the STS take on post-truth politics here is institutional and discursive: instead of focusing on the scientific and the misleading in individual policies, I provide an ethnography of rumour and scientific discourse on Covid, capturing their interactions and net effects in the context of policy discussions. Following closely the daily press conferences held by the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC), the only official information source for the Covid pandemic, I argue that discursive frames were made upon the limited information given and few confirmed cases found. Through the expert authority and ?what if?? scenarios seen at these conferences, Taiwan?s anti-Covid policies came to be presented as a narrative on crises and what the government was doing to get over them, and rumours were either ignored or marginalised. Meanwhile, though disputes and speculations on pandemic control did exist among experts, they only surfaced after the local outbreak, whereupon conspiracy theories flared up, challenging the already exhausted CECC. Together, the excessive information by experts, health professionals, policy analysists and talkshow hosts composes a ?post-truth normal? that has started to place Taiwan?s democracy and its trust in expertise on trial.","Kuo, Wen-Hua","Science, Technology and Society",https://doi.org/10.1177/09717218211032894,288

Under the R&D Blueprint Plan of Action, the World Health Organization (WHO) has convened a group of experts to agree on standard procedures to rapidly evaluate experimental vaccines during PHEs while maintaining the highest scientific and ethical standards. The Blueprint priority diseases, selected for their likelihood to cause PHEs and the lack of adequate medical countermeasures, were used to frame our methodological discussions. Here, we outline major vaccine study designs to be used in PHEs and summarize high-level recommendations for their use in this setting. We recognize that the epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the Blueprint priority diseases may be highly uncertain and that the unique characteristics of the vaccines and outbreak settings may affect our study design. To address these challenges, our group underscores the need for novel, flexible, and responsive trial designs. We conclude that assignment to study groups using randomization is a key principle underlying rigorous study design and should be utilized except in exceptional circumstances. Advance planning for vaccine trial designs is critical for rapid and effective response to a PHE and to advance knowledge to address and mitigate future PHEs.

The evaluation was narrowed to two mRNA vaccines and two modified adenovirus vectored vaccines. METHODS: A frequentist random effects meta-analysis was carried out after data extraction. Risk of bias of the included studies was assessed using New-Castle-Ottawa Scale. The overall risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by real time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was estimated in partially and fully vaccinated individuals. The effect size was expressed as Relative Risk (RR) and RRR (RR reduction) of SARS-CoV-2 infection after vaccination. Potential sources of heterogeneity were investigated through between-study heterogeneity analysis and subgroup meta-analysis. RESULTS: The systematic review identified 27 studies eligible for the quantitative synthesis. Partially vaccinated individuals presented a RRR=73% (95%CI=59%-83%) for any positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR (RR=0.27) and a RRR=79% (95%CI=30%-93%) for symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 PCR (RR=0.21). Fully vaccinated individuals showed a RRR=94% (95%CI=88%-98%) for any SARS-CoV-2 positive PCR (RR=0.06) compared to unvaccinated. According to the subgroup meta-analysis, full BNT162b2 vaccination protocol achieved a RRR=84%-94% against any SARS-CoV-2 positive PCR and a RRR=68%-84% against symptomatic positive PCR. The RR for any SARS-CoV-2 positive PCR remained higher within elderly groups aged [≥]69 years (RR=0.12-0.15) compared to younger individuals (RR=0.05-0.12). The RR against B.1.351 infection approached 0.40 for any positive PCR and 0.36 for symptomatic SARS-COV-2 while the RR of any B.1.1.7 infection was 0.14. CONCLUSION: The current licensed vaccines may be transmission blocking, especially after full vaccination protocol. Given the substantial heterogeneity, results should be interpreted with caution. Subgroups meta-analyses suggested that the risk of any SARS-CoV-2 infection may be higher for non-B.1.1.7 variants and individuals aged [≥]69 years. Further data and longer follow-up are required to investigate additional sources of heterogeneity and the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination within population subgroups.","Meggiolaro, A.; Sane Schepisi, M.; Nikolaidis, G.; Mipatrini, D.; Siddu, A.; Rezza, G.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.25.21262529v1?rss=1,288

We aim to determine whether distance to an inner-city hospital in Newark, was associated with mortality in patients admitted for COVID-19 during the peak of the pandemic. Methods: Patients who were admitted for COVID-19 at the Newark Beth Israel Medical Center (NBIMC) were stratified into two groups based on distance between the zip codes of their primary residence and the hospital. Baseline demographics, clinical characteristics and in-hospital outcomes were compared between subjects living within a 2-mile radius of the zip code of the hospital [Neighbors] and those living further than 2 miles [Distant]. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), length of hospitalization, and discharge disposition. Results: Between March 09 and May 04, 2020, a total of 769 patients were admitted for COVID-19 at NBIMC. 406 (53%) resided within a 2-mile radius of the hospital location. of these 44% were obese. History of hypertension, diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease was documented in 69%, 48% and 23% respectively. Compared with distant patients, neighbors were older (59 vs. 69 yrs. P=0.048), mostly of Black/African American race (64% vs. 82%;p&lt;0.001) and had a higherincidence of diabetes mellitus (40% vs. 48%;p=0.025) or coronary artery disease (17% vs. 23%;p=0.039). Visitors were more likely to report an exposure history to a COVID-19 patient thanneighbors (31% vs. 21%, p=0.001). In-hospital death rate were significantly higher in neighbors thanvisitors (32% vs. 22%, p=0.007). Admission to the ICU was similar between both groups (p=0.438).Among those who survived to discharge, distant patients had longer length of hospitalization (12 vs.10 days;p=0.006), than neighbors. Discharge disposition was comparable in both groups (p=0.249) Conclusions: In this cross-sectional study of patients admitted to an inner-city hospital for COVID-19, majority of patients living within a 2-mile radius were of Blacks/African Americans who had ahigher incidence of DM and CAD. A paradoxical association between distance to the hospital and in-hospital mortality was observed.

We propose two efficient Bayesian network models that are potent in encoding causal relations among random variable, i.e., COVID-19 symptoms. The first Bayesian network model, denoted as BN1, is built depending on the acquired knowledge from medical experts. We collect data from clinics and hospitals in Saudi Arabia for our research. We name this authentic dataset DScovid. The second Bayesian network model, denoted as BN2, is learned from the real dataset DScovid depending on Chow-Liu tree approach. We also implement our proposed Bayesian network models and present our experimental results. Our results show that the proposed approaches are capable of modeling the issue of making decisions in the context of COVID-19. Moreover, our experimental results show that the two Bayesian network models we propose in this work are effective for not only extracting casual relations but also reducing uncertainty and increasing the effectiveness of causal reasoning and prediction. © 2021.

188108,SARS: make no mistake--there will be a next time.,2003,"Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) causes a highly contagious and economically significant disease in chickens. Establishment of a carrier state in IBV infection and the potential for the persistent virus to undergo mutations and recombination in chicken tissues have important consequences for disease management. Nevertheless, whether chickens can maintain persistent IBV infection in the absence of reinfection from exogenous sources or the presence of antibody in the host can modulate virus persistence remains unclear. Indeed, whether or not IBV genome can undergo genetic changes during in vivo infection has not been demonstrated experimentally. In the present study, IBV shedding and tissue persistence were monitored in individual chickens maintained under strict isolation that precluded reinfection from exogenous sources. In the first of two experiments, intranasal exposure of 6-wk-old antibody-free chickens to IBV vaccine virus resulted in intermittent shedding of the virus from both trachea and cloaca of individual birds for up to 63 days. Also, the virus was recovered from the internal organs (spleen, gonad, kidney, lung, cecal tonsil, and cloacal bursa) of six of eight birds killed at various intervals between 27 and 163 days postinoculation (DPI). In the second experiment, IBV exposure of 1-day-old maternal antibody-positive chicks led to periodic virus shedding from the trachea and cloaca in all chickens until 77 days; however, internal organs (lungs and kidneys) of only one of seven birds (killed at 175 DPI) were virus positive, suggesting that presence of antibody at the time of infection protects internal organs from IBV infection. When the lung and kidney isolates of IBV from the latter experiment were compared with the parent-vaccine virus, no changes in their antigenicity, tissue tropism, or the nucleotide sequence of the S1 glycoprotein gene were observed. These findings indicate that, unlike the mammalian coronaviruses, propensity for frequent genetic change may not be inherent in the IBV genome.","Naqi, Syed; Gay, Kathryn; Patalla, Prasad; Mondal, Shankar; Liu, Runzhong",Avian diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14562886/,288
188804,Prevalence and clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with Behçet's syndrome.,2021-06-09,"In attempts to recharacterize several markers of putative rat liver progenitor cells, single-stage reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses failed to confirm the reported immunochemical detection of albumin, alpha(1)-fetoprotein, and cytochrome P450-1A2 in the clonal line, 3(8)#21, and the cloned derivative, 3(8)#21-EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein). Undetectable expression occurred whether or not both lines were cultured on or off feeder layers of gamma-irradiated mouse embryonic STO (SIM [Sandoz inbred Swiss mouse] thioguanine-resistant ouabain-resistant) cells. PCR amplification of liver progenitor cell chromosomal (rat and mouse Pigr, rat INS1, mouse INS2) and mitochondrial (rat and mouse COX1) genes revealed only mouse sequences. Further analyses of rat and mouse COX1 sequences in cells from untampered storage vials of all 11 reported liver progenitor cell lines and strains revealed only mouse sequences. In addition, uniquely similar metaphase spreads were observed in STO, 3(8)#21, and 3(8)#21-EGFP cells. The combined results suggest that the previously reported ""rat"" liver progenitor cell lines were most likely generated during early derivation in cell culture from gamma-radiation-resistant or ineffectively irradiated mouse STO cells used as the feeder layers. These findings reveal new types of artifacts encountered in cocultures of tissue progenitor cells and feeder layer cell lines, and they sound a cautionary note: phenotypic and genotypic properties of feeder layers should be well-characterized before and during coculture with newly derived stem cells and clonal derivatives.","Zhang, Mingjun; Sell, Stewart; Leffert, Hyam L",Stem cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12832698/,288

189419,"Virus profile in children with acute respiratory infections with various severities in Beijing, China.",2014,"OBJECTIVE To determine the RBC lifespan of Greyhounds, using an in vitro labeling technique. DESIGN RBC from dogs were labeled with NHS-biotin and their disappearance measured over time to determine RBC lifespan. SAMPLE POPULATION 5 Greyhounds that had been vaccinated against distemper, adenovirus 1 and 2 infections, parainfluenza, leptospirosis, parvovirus, and coronavirus infections, Bordetella bronchiseptica infection, and rabies the previous year; 3 sexually intact 14-month-old Beagles served as controls. PROCEDURE After venipuncture for CBC, catheters were inserted in the cephalic vein of each dog. Butorphanol was then administered to achieve mild sedation and analgesia, and glycopyrrolate was administered to ensure maintenance of adequate heart rate during phlebotomy. Dogs were positioned in lateral recumbency; blood was removed via jugular venipuncture, using a standard laboratory donor blood bag containing citrate-phosphate-dextrose solution. Blood was transferred aseptically into sterile polystyrene containers and NHS-biotin was added. After incubation, the labeled RBC were reinfused into the dogs and the blood was allowed to recirculate for 1 hour before the first postinfusion sample was taken. At frequent intervals, blood to be analyzed was taken by jugular venipuncture, and the percentage of labeled cells was determined by flow cytometry. RESULTS The mean RBC lifespan of non-Greyhounds was significantly longer than that of Greyhounds (104.3 +/- 2.2 days vs 53.6 +/- 6.5 days; P = 0.001). A negative linear correlation was also found between age of the Greyhounds and their RBC lifespan (P = 0.01, R2 = 0.91). CONCLUSIONS The shorter RBC lifespan of the Greyhounds may explain the finding of macrocytosis reported in earlier work. The reason for the shorter RBC lifespan in Greyhounds may be caused by differences in Greyhound RBC membrane structure or accelerated RBC removal from the circulation.","Novinger, M S; Sullivan, P S; McDonald, T P",American journal of veterinary research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8723892/,288
189808,Drug targets in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus and other coronavirus infections.,2009,"BACKGROUND Covid-19 is a latent threat; a sector of the population with a labor obligation carries out its work not in person in an unplanned context due to the extraordinary social distancing expressed in remote work, without previous experience in many cases and with health exposure due to psychosocial risk factors conditioning stress. Our objective was to describe the fatigue and mental burden in teleworkers through a bibliographic review, of interest for occupational health, public health, clinical research, psychology and other areas of knowledge. We also intend to inform the community about these issues to promote safe telework and ensure a balanced quality of life. METHODS Structured information on the topics of fatigue and mental load was presented, based on the analysis of international literature, mainly from recent years, obtained from the search engine reviews of scientific publications Ebsco, PubMed, and supplemented with Google Scholar, according to recognized thesauri, in English and Spanish. RESULTS There are also psychosocial risks in teleworking; work-related stress can be linked to fatigue, which should also be addressed as a psychosocial risk. Fatigue, although multi-causal, can be occupational in origin and may be conditioned by various aspects of labour, such as the mental workload, which is pernicious at its extremes. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that both fatigue and mental workload must be watched, their extremes threaten the quality of work life.","Venegas Tresierra, Carlos Eduardo; Leyva Pozo, Astrid Carolina",Revista espanola de salud publica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33034306/,288

ANIMALS 62 veal calves. PROCEDURE Fecal samples collected on days 0, 4, 14, and 35 after arrival were tested for BoTV by use of ELISA and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Paired serum samples obtained from blood collected on days 0 and 35 were analyzed for BoTV antibodies with a hemagglutination inhibition assay. Fecal samples were also screened for other enteric pathogens, including rotavirus, coronavirus, and Cryptosporidium spp. RESULTS Fecal shedding of BoTV was detected in 15 of 62 (24%) calves by use of ELISA and RT-PCR assay, with peak shedding on day 4. A significant independent association between BoTV shedding and diarrhea was observed. In addition, calves shedding > or = 2 enteric pathogens were more likely to have diarrhea than calves shedding < or = 1 pathogen. Calves that were seronegative or had low antibody titers against BoTV (< or = 1:10 hemagglutination inhibition units) at arrival seroconverted to BoTV (> 4-fold increase in titer); these calves were more likely to shed virus than calves that were seropositive against BoTV at arrival. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Shedding of BoTV was strongly associated with diarrhea in neonatal veal calves during the first week after arrival at the farm. These data provide evidence that BoTV is an important pathogen of neonatal veal calves.","Hoet, Armando E; Smiley, Jeffrey; Thomas, Christopher; Nielsen, Paul R; Wittum, Thomas E; Saif, Linda J",American journal of veterinary research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12693541/,288
197408,"[Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)--new, unknown disease?].",2004,"Avian influenza has been a source of worldwide concern since Hong Kong authorities detected the first outbreak in 1997. Mainly as a result of poultry-to-human transmission, more than 200 cases of infection in humans have been attributed to the A/H5, A/H7, and A/H9 viral subtypes, with a case fatality rate for A/H5N1 infections exceeding 50%. A mutant or reassortant virus capable of efficient human-to-human transmission can set off a pandemic. Increased attention to prophylaxis against viral infection has identified several potentially complementary approaches: nonpharmacologic measures (eg, travel restrictions), vaccination, chemotherapeutic agents, and herbal/natural products. All have significant limitations that point out the need for additional modalities. Herbal/natural products, particularly those based on green tea extract, offer promise as adjuncts or alternatives to current interventions and warrant further evaluation in well-controlled human trials.","Guralnik, Mario; Rosenbloom, Richard A; Petteruti, Michael P; Lefante, Carolyn",American journal of therapeutics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17890934/,288

Incidence and case fatality rate are significantly higher among elderly individuals (age>60 years), type 2 diabetes and hypertension patients. Cellular receptor ACE2, serine protease TMPRSS2 and exopeptidase CD26 (also known as DPP4) are the three membrane bound proteins potentially implicated in SARS-CoV-2 infection. We hypothesised that common variants from TMPRSS2 and CD26 may play critical role in infection susceptibility of predisposed population or group of individuals. Coding (missense) and regulatory variants from TMPRSS2 and CD26 were studied across 26 global populations. Two missense and five regulatory SNPs were identified to have differential allelic frequency. Significant linkage disequilibrium (LD) signature was observed in different populations. Modelled protein-protein interaction (PPI) predicted strong molecular interaction between these two receptors and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S1 domain). However, two missense SNPs, rs12329760 (TMPRSS2) and rs1129599 (CD26), were not found to be involved physically in the said interaction. Four regulatory variants (rs112657409, rs11910678, rs77675406 and rs713400) from TMPRSS2 were found to influence the expression of TMPRSS2 and pathologically relevant MX1. rs13015258 a 50 UTR variant from CD26 have significant role in regulation of expression of key regulatory genes that could be involved in SARS-CoV-2 internalization. Overexpression of CD26 through epigenetic modification at rs13015258-C allele was found critical and could explain the higher SARS-CoV-2 infected fatality rate among type 2 diabetes.","Senapati, Sabyasachi; Kumar, Shashank; Singh, Atul K; Banerjee, Pratibha; Bhagavatula, Sandilya",Journal of genetics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32661206/,288

METHODS Eighty-one hemodialysis units were investigated on the incidence and preventive measures for SARS from March to July 2003 by a standardized investigation form. RESULTS (1) Seven hemodialysis patients were diagnosed as SARS clinically and account for 0.24% of total 2885 hemodialysis patients in these units in Beijing. Among the 7 SARS patients, 3 recovered from SARS and 4 died. No case was infected within the hemodialysis units. No SARS case or suspected case was found in the health care workers in hemodialysis units. (2) Additional disinfected measures were carried out in all the hemodialysis units. 98.8% (80/81) of them did not reuse the dialyzer. (3) 98.8% (80/81) of the hemodialysis units developed education about preventing SARS among hemodialysis patients. Before dialysis treatment patients must take temperature, change specific clothes and shoes in over 90% of the hemodialysis units. (4) All health care workers in the hemodialysis units wore hats and gauze masks and 93.7% (74/79) of them wore gloves. Eye shield was worn in 22.8% (18/79) of the dialysis units centers. CONCLUSIONS No ARS case was infected within the hemodialysis units in Beijing. Intensified disinfection of surroundings, self-protection for health care workers and education for patients in personal hygiene habit may be helpful to prevention of SARS in hemodialysis units.","Wang, Mei",Zhonghua nei ke za zhi,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15312434/,288
199149,Sick from What? Trauma During the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic,2021,"The pathogenicity of neutralization-resistant mutants of the enteric coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) was examined in the newborn piglet. The parental virus (Purdue-115 strain), as well as several mutants selected using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed to antigenic sites A and B, caused an acute enteritis with 100% mortality. By contrast, most of the site D (MAb 40.1) mutants exhibited a strongly reduced enteropathogenicity, leading to the survival of animals inoculated with up to 1000-fold the 100% lethal dose of parental virus. Such a phenotypical change was correlated with point mutations or a small deletion, all located within the S gene sequence coding for the Pro-145 to Cys-155 segment of the mature polypeptide. These observations suggest that an N-terminal subregion of the S molecule is an essential determinant for pathogenesis in TGEV infection.","Bernard, S; Laude, H",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7561760/,288

In Nigeria, it is limited to few isolated reports and case series confined to the early phase of the outbreak. The objective of this study is to describe the presenting characteristics, co-morbidities and outcomes of Nigerian patients managed over a 3-month period in a tertiary hospital. METHODS This was a descriptive cross-sectional study involving the total population of patients with laboratory confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 in the University of Benin Teaching Hospital, Edo State, Nigeria from March 31 to June 30, 2020. Data was collected using a review of patients' records. Analysis was by IBM SPSS version 25.0. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05. RESULTS A total of 173 patients with mean age (SD) 50.7± 20.1 years were managed. One hundred and five (60.7%) were males and the commonest age group was 20-39 years (34.7%). The commonest presenting symptoms were fever, cough and malaise found in 103 (71.5%), 101 (70.1%) and 63 (43.8%) patients respectively. Twenty-five (14.5%) patients had severe disease; 60 (34.7%) had underlying medical conditions mostly hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Outcome analyses showed 117 (67.6%) discharges, 45 (26.0%) deaths, 10 (5.8%) discharges against medical advice, and 1 (0.6%) transfer to another facility.

The impact of ACP on cerebral oxygenation and serum creatinine at a more tepid 25 °C was studied in newborns and children. METHODS Between 2010 and 2014, 61 newborns and children (<5 years old) underwent aortic arch reconstruction using moderate hypothermia (25.0±0.9 °C) with ACP and a pH-stat blood gas management strategy. These included 44% Norwood-type operations, 30% isolated arch reconstructions, and 26% arch reconstructions with other major procedures. Median patient age at surgery was 9 days (range, 3 days-4.7 years). Cerebral oxygenation (NIRS) was monitored continuously perioperatively for 120 hours. Serum creatinine was monitored daily. RESULTS Median cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and cross clamp times were 181 minutes (range, 82-652 minutes) and 72 minutes (range, 10-364 minutes), respectively. ACP was performed at a mean flow rate of 46±6 mL/min/kg for a median of 48 minutes (range, 10-123 minutes). Cerebral and somatic NIRS were preserved intraoperatively and remained at baseline postoperatively during the first 120 hours. Peak postoperative serum creatinine levels averaged 0.7±0.3 mg/dL for all patients. There were 4 (6.6%) discharge mortalities. Six patients (9.8%) required ECMO support. Median postoperative length of hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) stay were 16 days(range, 4-104 days) and 9 days (range, 1-104 days), respectively. Two patients (3.3%) received short-term peritoneal dialysis for fluid removal, and none required hemodialysis. Three patients (4.9%) had an isolated seizure which resolved with medical therapy, and none had a neurologic deficit or stroke. CONCLUSIONS ACP at 25 °C preserved perioperative cerebral oxygenation and serum creatinine for newborns and children undergoing arch reconstruction. Early outcomes are encouraging, and additional study is warranted to assess the impact on late outcomes.","Gupta, Bhawna; Dodge-Khatami, Ali; Tucker, Juan; Taylor, Mary B; Maposa, Douglas; Urencio, Miguel; Salazar, Jorge D",Translational pediatrics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27709092/,288

204336,Scientific evidence supports aerosol transmission of SARS-COV-2,2020,"From preventing cholera and diarrhea by reducing exposure to human waste, to reducing transmission of COVID-19 through handwashing, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) can save lives. Numerous global health initiatives have been created to combat the spread of infectious diseases. However, according to the Sanitation and Hygiene Fund, ""decades of under investment in sanitation and hygiene have made this sector the weakest link in our efforts to achieve the [Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)]."" There appear to be various reasons for the lag in global attention to, funding toward, and innovation around WASH-related diseases. Firstly, WASH is comprised of three interrelated components, water, sanitation, and hygiene, each of which has its own subset of indicators, priorities, and infrastructure, thus making streamlined communications and impact measurement within the sector incredibly complex. Secondly, WASH is a field that bridges many sectors, and there has historically been a lack of understanding of where responsibility lies to consistently fund and execute WASH interventions, programming, and policymaking. Additionally, public health research and funding tend to favor evaluations using randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which are often referred to as the ""gold standard."" RCTs, like all single evaluative methods, have limitations which may not effectively capture the complexity of WASH interventions and their subsequent multi-sectoral outcomes. In some cases ""it may be infeasible (or unethical) to randomize communities to a [WASH] intervention"" which would prohibit the research from reaching the current ""gold standard"" threshold for academic rigor and subsequent funding. A new concept called ""Transformative WASH"" has recently emerged in the WASH sector as a result of three RCTs and calls for a ""comprehensive package of WASH interventions"" to effectively improve health and social outcomes. We believe that the current definition of the ""gold standard"" in academic research is failing the WASH sector and does not align with ""Transformative WASH."" Rather, the ""gold standard"" should instead be a mixed methods research toolkit that utilizes Human-Centered Design (HCD) practices, and proxy methods such as ""participatory design"" or ""Behavior Centered Design theory"" to better design and evaluate WASH interventions.","Burton, Jasmine Patel Devika Landry Grace Anderson Sarah M.; Rary, Emma",Environmental Health Insights,,288

It has caused infections in humans in China since 2013. Five waves of the H7N9 influenza epidemic occurred in China between March 2013 and September 2017. H7N9 with low-pathogenicity dominated in the first four waves, whereas highly pathogenic H7N9 influenza emerged in poultry and spread to humans during the fifth wave, causing wide concern. Specialists and officials from China and other countries responded quickly, controlled the epidemic well thus far, and characterized the virus by using new technologies and surveillance tools that were made possible by their preparedness efforts. Here, we review the characteristics of the H7N9 viruses that were identified while controlling the spread of the disease. It was summarized and discussed from the perspectives of molecular epidemiology, clinical features, virulence and pathogenesis, receptor binding, T-cell responses, monoclonal antibody development, vaccine development, and disease burden. These data provide tools for minimizing the future threat of H7N9 and other emerging and re-emerging viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2.","Liu, William J; Xiao, Haixia; Dai, Lianpan; Liu, Di; Chen, Jianjun; Qi, Xiaopeng; Bi, Yuhai; Shi, Yi; Gao, George F; Liu, Yingxia",Front.

December 2019 has marked the emergence of a novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-2019) originated in China in the city of Wuhan. Drastic emergence and spread of infectious disease have shown to appear in highly densified areas causing rapid spread of epidemic through population movement, transmission routes, major activity nodes, proximity, and connectivity of urban spaces. An extreme number of cases rising throughout the world caused space unavailability in healthcare facilities to serve patients infected with Covid-2019, therefore urging for innovative emergency management response from construction and architecture industry. Prefabricated modular construction has been widely utilized around the globe assembling rapid response facilities after catastrophic events such as tornadoes, hurricanes, and forest fires. An increasing number of Covid-2019 cases demanded effective and compressed implementation of medical centres to provide expeditious and secure healthcare. The paper examines the potential of standardization of modular construction of hospitals as a response to current and potential pandemic outbreaks.

205563,Detection profile of SARS-CoV-2 using RT-PCR in different types of clinical specimens: A systematic review and meta-analysis,2021,"Social media use and texting among college students often coincide with drinking. The present study investigated the associations between monthly alcohol use, social media habits, sharing alcohol references, and drunk texting among Hispanic college students. Participants (n = 620, 71.6% female; Mage = 21.07 years, SD = 3.60) completed an online survey containing: demographics, drug use frequency, Sharing of Alcohol-Related Content on Social Media Sites Scale (SARC), Texting Under the Influence Scale, Strategic Self Presentation Scale, Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale, and iPhone Screen Time. Bivariate correlations assessed relationships between all variables. Six logistic regressions assessed subscales of the SARC, and a linear regression assessed the Texting Under the Influence Scale. Almost 15% of participants met criteria for social media addiction, almost 40% reported ever sharing alcohol posts, and approximately 20% reported drunk texting at least once per month. Participants with iPhones averaged 16.84 weekly hours on social media (based on ""screen time""). Frequently posting references of drinking alone was associated with more time on social media, higher social media addiction, and greater public sharing of alcohol content. Conversely, posting references of drinking at social gatherings was associated with privately sharing alcohol references and increased social media addiction. Drunk texting was related to increased age, greater Instagram use, decreased Facebook use, and privately sharing alcohol posts. Findings suggest patterns of drinking and sharing alcohol-related content to inform health promotion efforts, especially while many during COVID-19 are heightening use of alcohol and social media.","Perez, Mariany A Gainza; Lerma, Marcos; Torres, Joshua; Cooper, Theodore V",J Technol Behav Sci,,288

Using the community-based UK Biobank cohort, we investigate risk factors for COVID-19 mortality in comparison with non-COVID-19 mortality. We investigated demographic, social (education, income, housing, employment), lifestyle (smoking, drinking, body mass index), biological (lipids, cystatin C, vitamin D), medical (comorbidities, medications) and environmental (air pollution) data from UK Biobank (N = 473,550) in relation to 459 COVID-19 and 2626 non-COVID-19 deaths to 21 September 2020. We used univariate, multivariable and penalised regression models. Age (OR = 2.76 [2.18-3.49] per S.D. [8.1 years], p = 2.6 × 10-17), male sex (OR = 1.47 [1.26-1.73], p = 1.3 × 10-6) and Black versus White ethnicity (OR = 1.21 [1.12-1.29], p = 3.0 × 10-7) were independently associated with and jointly explanatory of (area under receiver operating characteristic curve, AUC = 0.79) increased risk of COVID-19 mortality. In multivariable regression, alongside demographic covariates, being a healthcare worker, current smoker, having cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, autoimmune disease, and oral steroid use at enrolment were independently associated with COVID-19 mortality. Penalised regression models selected income, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, cystatin C, and oral steroid use as jointly contributing to COVID-19 mortality risk; Black ethnicity, hypertension and oral steroid use contributed to COVID-19 but not non-COVID-19 mortality. Age, male sex and Black ethnicity, as well as comorbidities and oral steroid use at enrolment were associated with increased risk of COVID-19 death. Our results suggest that previously reported associations of COVID-19 mortality with body mass index, low vitamin D, air pollutants, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors may be explained by the aforementioned factors.","Elliott, Joshua; Bodinier, Barbara; Whitaker, Matthew; Delpierre, Cyrille; Vermeulen, Roel; Tzoulaki, Ioanna; Elliott, Paul; Chadeau-Hyam, Marc",Eur J Epidemiol,,288
206422,Prevalence of Post-COVID-19 Cough One Year After SARS-CoV-2 Infection: A Multicenter Study,2021,"In Ghana, minibus taxis (trotros) are an important mode of transport that commute about 60% of the traveling public. In spite of their popularity, minibuses are generally inefficient, disorganized and have low service quality. In an attempt to assess service quality of the service, a modified SERVPERF tool was developed. Differences in perceptions of service quality between male and female respondents were also assessed, and the attractiveness of certain technological features as possible remedies to service quality issues were determined. Using an online Google forms version of the modified SERVPERF, responses from nearly one thousand commuters were collected. The link to the questionnaire was dispersed via social media (Whatsapp and Telegram) since the data was collected during the outbreak of COVID-19 in Ghana. Following a factor reduction, the most important service quality factors determined to affect trotro users were (i) Reliability of the service, (ii) Variability in cost and (iii) Responsiveness. Respondents also identified technologies that could help them (a) book, (b) report driver misbehavior, (c) make safe e-payments and (d) track the location of trotros, as most likely to improve their trotro service quality. The findings suggest that some mobility as a service features could have possible benefit for the trotro. The study is however limited in its ability to determine the exact impact of these technologies since it uses a stated preference approach. Future research could explore the willingness of other stakeholder groups such as operators in adopting these technologies since their participation would be key to the success of any such scheme.","Dzisi, E.; Obeng, D.

With the use of drama in education, it is aimed that children who participate in the learning process by having fun become self-actualized, creative, honest, open to communication and independent individuals. In this study, it was investigated whether the drama method, which is one of the effective teaching methods, can be applied in distance education, and drama activity proposals were created. In the study, three different drama activities were presented, which were prepared in accordance with the outcomes for the primary school 1st grade Life Science lesson and suitable for distance education, after the teaching with these activities, the opinions of the classroom teacher and students about the process were collected with a semistructured interview form. According to the opinions received, it was concluded that technological problems can be a major obstacle to the application of the drama method in distance education, some students may have motivation problems. Better results can be obtained by increasing the frequency of using the drama method, this method can be used in almost every unit of the Life Science lesson, if the curriculum was revised according to distance education, appropriate drama activities should be included, the drama activities presented in this study were sufficient in terms of unit gains and implementation, and students found the lesson taught with this method enjoyable.

219431,Coinfection with SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A Virus in a 32-Year-Old Man,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has world-widely motivated numerous attempts to properly adjust classical epidemiological models, namely those of the SEIR-type, to the spreading characteristics of the novel Corona virus. In this context, the fundamental structure of the differential equations making up the SEIR models has remained largely unaltered—presuming that COVID-19 may be just “another epidemic”. We here take an alternative approach, by investigating the relevance of one key ingredient of the SEIR models, namely the death kinetics law. The latter is compared to an alternative approach, which we call infection-to-death delay rule. For that purpose, we check how well these two mathematical formulations are able to represent the publicly available country-specific data on recorded fatalities, across a selection of 57 different nations. Thereby, we consider that the model-governing parameters—namely, the death transmission coefficient for the death kinetics model, as well as the apparent fatality-to-case fraction and the characteristic fatal illness period for the infection-to-death delay rule—are time-invariant. For 55 out of the 57 countries, the infection-to-death delay rule turns out to represent the actual situation significantly more precisely than the classical death kinetics rule. We regard this as an important step towards making SEIR-approaches more fit for the COVID-19 spreading prediction challenge.","Scheiner, Stefan; Ukaj, Niketa; Hellmich, Christian",Chaos Solitons Fractals,,288

However, the functions of notopterol and its molecular target in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment remain unknown. Here, we show in different RA mouse strains that both oral and intraperitoneal administration of notopterol result in significant therapeutic effects. Mechanistically, notopterol directly binds Janus kinase (JAK)2 and JAK3 kinase domains to inhibit JAK/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT) activation, leading to reduced production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Critically, combination therapy using both notopterol and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blocker results in enhanced therapeutic effects compared to using TNF blocker alone. We demonstrate that notopterol ameliorates RA pathology by targeting JAK-STAT signaling, raising the possibility that notopterol could be effective in treating other diseases characterized by aberrant JAK-STAT signaling pathway.","Wang, Qiong; Zhou, Xin; Yang, Long; Zhao, Yongjian; Chew, Zhihuan; Xiao, Jun; Liu, Chang; Zheng, Xin; Zheng, Yuxiao; Shi, Qi; Liang, Qianqian; Wang, Yongjun; Wang, Hongyan",Cell Rep,,288

In this paper, we analyzed the correlation between the number of COVID-19 cases and human mobility, and meteorological data in Brazilian capitals. We found that the correlation between such variables depends on the regions where the cities are located. We employed the variables with a significant correlation with COVID-19 cases to predict the number of COVID-19 infections in all Brazilian capitals and proposed a prediction method combining the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) method with the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average Exogenous inputs (ARIMAX) method, which we called EEMD-ARIMAX. After analyzing the results poor predictions were further investigated using a signal processing-based anomaly detection method. Computational tests showed that EEMD-ARIMAX achieved a forecast 26.73% better than ARIMAX. Moreover, an improvement of 30.69% in the average root mean squared error (RMSE) was noticed when applying the EEMD-ARIMAX method to the data normalized after the anomaly detection.","da Silva, Tiago Tiburcio; Francisquini, Rodrigo; V Nascimento, Maric C",Expert Syst Appl,,288
222369,"Forecasting the burden of COVID-19 hospitalized patients during the SARS-CoV-2 second wave in Lombardy, Italy",2020,"There is an urgent need for effective treatment and preventive vaccine to contain this devastating global pandemic, which requires a comprehensive understanding of humoral responses specific to SARS-CoV-2 during the disease progression and convalescent phase of COVID-19 patients. We continuously monitored the serum IgM and IgG responses specific to four SARS-CoV-2 related antigens, including the nucleoprotein (NP), receptor binding domain (RBD), S1 protein, and ectodomain (ECD) of the spike protein among non-severe and severe COVID-19 patients for seven weeks since disease onset. Most patients generated humoral responses against NP and spike protein-related antigens but with their distinct kinetics profiles. Combined detection of NP and ECD antigens as detecting antigen synergistically improved the sensitivity of the serological assay, compared to that of using NP or RBD as detection antigen. 80.7% of convalescent sera from COVID-19 patients revealed that the varying extents of neutralization activities against SARS-CoV-2. S1-specific and ECD-specific IgA responses were strongly correlated with the neutralization activities in non-severe patients, but not in severe patients. Moreover, the neutralizing activities of the convalescent sera were shown to significantly decline during the period between 21 days to 28 days after hospital discharge, accompanied by a substantial drop in RBD-specific IgA response. Our data provide evidence that are crucial for serological testing, antibody-based intervention, and vaccine design of COVID-19.","Chen, Yuxin; Tong, Xin; Li, Yang; Gu, Bin; Yan, Jiawei; Liu, Yong; Shen, Han; Huang, Rui; Wu, Chao",PLoS Pathog,,288

As of June 11 2021, later one has attributed more than 174 million confirmed cases and over 3.5 million deaths globally. Nonetheless, a World Bank Group flagship report features Covid-19 induced global crisis as the strongest post-recession since World WarII. Currently, all approved therapeutics or vaccines are strictly allowed for emergency use. Hence, in the absence of pharmaceutical interventions, it is vital to analyze data set covering the growth rates of positive human cases, number of recoveries, other factors, and future strategies to manage the growth of fatal Covid-19 effectively. The Uttarakhand state of India is snuggled in the lap of the Himalayas and occupies more people than Israel, Switzerland, Hong Kong, etc. This study analyzed state Covid-19 data, fetched from an authenticated government repository using Python 3.9 from April 1, 2020, to February 28, 2021. In the first wave, plain areas of Uttarakhand covering the districts Dehradun, Haridwar, Nainital, and U. S. Nagar were severely affected and reported peak positive cases during the 21st - 26th week. Other hands, the hilly terrains of Uttarakhand districts, including Chamoli, Pauri Garhwal, and Rudraprayag, reported a high number of positive cases between the 30th and 31st week, and other hilly districts reported an increase in Covid-19 cases during the 34th to 38th week. The highest recovery rate was attributed to the hilly district Rudraprayag. The analysis also revealed that a very high doubling rate was seen during the last week of May to the first week of Jun 2020.

To this aim, it is necessary to establish reliable, fast, and cheap tools to detect viral particles in biological material so to identify the people capable of spreading the infection. We demonstrate that a colorimetric biosensor based on gold nanoparticle (AuNP) interaction induced by SARS-CoV-2 lends itself as an outstanding tool for detecting viral particles in nasal and throat swabs. The extinction spectrum of a colloidal solution of multiple viral-target gold nanoparticles-AuNPs functionalized with antibodies targeting three surface proteins of SARS-CoV-2 (spike, envelope, and membrane)-is red-shifted in few minutes when mixed with a solution containing the viral particle. The optical density of the mixed solution measured at 560 nm was compared to the threshold cycle (Ct) of a real-time PCR (gold standard for detecting the presence of viruses) finding that the colorimetric method is able to detect very low viral load with a detection limit approaching that of the real-time PCR. Since the method is sensitive to the infecting viral particle rather than to its RNA, the achievements reported here open a new perspective not only in the context of the current and possible future pandemics, but also in microbiology, as the biosensor proves itself to be a powerful though simple tool for measuring the viral particle concentration.","Ventura, Bartolomeo Della; Cennamo, Michele; Minopoli, Antonio; Campanile, Raffaele; Censi, Sergio Bolletti; Terracciano, Daniela; Portella, Giuseppe; Velotta, Raffaele",ACS Sens,,288

The pandemic has also caused significant and ongoing disruption to the economy, likely causing less work placement opportunities for upcoming years within the context of limited institutional budgets and resourcing. It is, therefore, vitally important that institutions develop diverse practices of WIL and shift away from a heavy reliance on work placements. Developing diverse WIL practices across educational institutions is an important strategy to build 'institutional WIL resilience' during times of disrupted economies with limited WIL opportunities. During the pandemic, the use of simulations had increased, in particular, in relation to preparing students for WIL, however, caution is needed in considering simulations as a comparable alternative to WIL.","Zegwaard, Karsten E.; Pretti, T.

This study focuses on the development of three-dimensional separated flow over the wing, and discuss flow structures formed on the wing surface as well as in the far field wake. Vorticity is introduced into the flow in a predominantly two-dimensional manner. The vortex sheet from the wing tip rolls up around the free end to form the tip vortex. At its inception, the tip vortex is weak and its effect is spatially confined. As the flow around the tip separates, the tip effects extend farther in the spanwise direction, generating noticeable three dimensionality in the wake. For low-aspect-ratio wings, the wake remains stable due to the strong downwash over the entire span. Increasing the aspect ratio allows unsteady vortical flow to emerge away from the tip at sufficiently high angles of attack. These unsteady vortices shed and form closed vortical loops. For higher-aspect-ratio wings, the tip effects retard the near-tip shedding process, which desynchronizes from the two-dimensional shedding over the mid-span region, yielding vortex dislocation. At high angles of attack, the tip vortex exhibits noticeable undulations due to the strong interaction with the unsteady shedding vortices. The spanwise distribution of force coefficients is related to the three-dimensional wake dynamics and the tip effects. Vortical elements in the wake that are responsible for the generation of lift and drag forces are identified through the force element analysis. We note that at high angles of attack, a stationary vortical structure forms at the leading edge near the tip, giving rise to locally high lift and drag forces. The analysis performed here reveals how the vortical flow around the tip influences the separation physics, the global wake dynamics, and the spanwise force distributions.","Zhang, Kai; Hayostek, Shelby; Amitay, Michael; He, Wei; Theofilis, Vassilios; Taira, Kunihiko",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.04729v1.pdf,288

The two main aims of this study were (1) to examine changes in food waste behaviors since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. and Italy; and (2) to investigate potential predictors of food waste behavior, including avoidance of supermarkets, increased home cooking, and increased role of health concerns in food choices. A sample of n = 478 (79% female) individuals from the U.S., mean (SD) age = 30.51 (10.85), and n = 476 individuals from Italy, (78% female), mean (SD) age = 33.84 (12.86), completed an online survey between April 8th and April 28th 2020. Just under half of respondents (49%) reported decreased food waste since the start of the pandemic. Rates were significantly higher among the U.S. sample (61.5%, n = 294) compared to the Italian sample (38%, n = 180). Controlling for the time since restrictions were introduced, age, gender, and perceived financial security, logistic regression revealed greater reduction in food waste since the beginning of the pandemic for U.S. individuals relative to participants from Italy (OR = 0.47, p < .001). In addition, increased importance of health concerns when making food choices (OR = 1.34, p < .005) as well as more frequent cooking (OR = 1.35, p < .001), and greater avoidance of supermarkets (OR = 1.15, p = .049) were associated with greater probability of less food waste. Scarcity and greater reliance on cooking may encourage individuals to reflect on food waste practices. Further research should explore how these factors may be targeted to reduce food waste beyond the pandemic.","Rodgers, Rachel F; Lombardo, Caterina; Cerolini, Silvia; Franko, Debra L; Omori, Mika; Linardon, Jake; Guillaume, Sebastien; Fischer, Laura; Tyszkiewicz, Matthew Fuller-",Appetite,,288

In this paper, we present short-term forecasts of COVID-19 for 28 Indian states and five union territories using real-time data from 30 January to 21 April 2020. Applying Holt's second-order exponential smoothing method and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, we generate 10-day ahead forecasts of the likely number of infected cases and deaths in India for 22 April to 1 May 2020. Our results show that the number of cumulative cases in India will rise to 36335.63 [PI 95% (30884.56, 42918.87)], concurrently the number of deaths may increase to 1099.38 [PI 95% (959.77, 1553.76)] by 1 May 2020. Further, we have divided the country into severity zones based on the cumulative cases. According to this analysis, Maharashtra is likely to be the most affected states with around 9787.24 [PI 95% (6949.81, 13757.06)] cumulative cases by 1 May 2020.

Endogenous GU-rich miRNAs activate endosomal TLR7 that plays a critical role in autoimmune diseases. We found that endogenous TLR7 ligands, miR-29 and miR-Let7b, were markedly increased in PsA compared to osteoarthritis (OA) synovial fluid (SF)s. We showed that intradermal (i.d.) miR-Let7b injection promoted skin inflammation, which was characterized by amplified Th1 cells, CD68+ M1 macrophages and transcriptional upregulation of glycolytic mediators, GLUT1, C-MYC and HIF1&#945;. Expansion of skin Th1 cells driven by miR-Let7b was also linked to elevated M1-associated IRFs. Interestingly, i.d. miR-Let7b administration exacerbated suboptimal joint inflammation along with metabolic reconfiguration of the PsA-like preclinical model. Moreover, TLR7 agonist, R837, potentiated metabolic reprogramming and expression of IL-1ß, IL-6 and IL-12 in murine macrophages, enabling myeloid-to-T cell crosstalk. Consistently, treatment with glycolytic inhibitors, 2-DG and/or HIF1&#945;i, reversed R837-induced metabolic remodeling and disrupted the TLR7-driven inflammatory phenotype in myeloid and lymphoid cells. Similar to miR-Let7b, R837 also differentiates progenitor cells into mature osteoclasts, primarily through RANKL induction. Taken together, this study indicates that TLR7-instigated metabolic rewiring of macrophages and their cross-regulation of T cells connects skin immunopathology to joint inflammation.

233201,Co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 with other respiratory viruses and performance of lower respiratory tract samples for the diagnosis of COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine ChAdOx1 nCov-19 may rarely lead to vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT). Antibody-mediated, platelet factor 4 (PF4)-dependent platelet activation appears to resemble a key mechanism in VITT, partially comparable to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. The use of PF4/heparin immunoassays has been proposed as part of a diagnostic approach, but their sensitivity has not been established. METHODS: Sera from 12 well-defined VITT patients were first studied by two different laboratories in functional assays. Sera where then used for an interlaboratory comparison, in which five different PF4/heparin immunoassays were used by four laboratories. RESULTS: Results for functional testing were highly concordant. VITT antibodies were also reliably detected by PF4/heparin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) (92-100%). In contrast, only 25% of VITT antibodies were reactive in a particle gel immunoassay (PaGIA), and 8% in a lateral flow assay (LFA). An automated chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) was negative for all sera tested (0%). CONCLUSION: It seems feasible to establish functional antibody testing for the confirmation of VITT. For the initial screening of suspected VITT cases, PaGIA, LFA, and CLIA are useless when applied as single tests. Only ELISA-based PF4/heparin immunoassays are sensitive enough to be incorporated in the diagnostic workup. However, a combination of a positive ELISA and a negative CLIA may be useful to identify VITT antibodies in the absence of confirmatory functional assays.","Sachs, Ulrich J; Cooper, Nina; Czwalinna, Andreas; Müller, Jens; Pötzsch, Bernd; Tiede, Andreas; Althaus, Karina",Thromb. haemost,,288

METHODS: Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor null (LDLr-/-) mice were fed Western diet with or without D-4F. We then measured atherosclerotic lesion formation, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) phosphorylation and its association with heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide anion (O2â¢-) production, and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) and GTP-cyclohydrolase 1 (GCH-1) concentration in the aorta. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and aortas were treated with oxidized LDL (oxLDL) with or without D-4F; subsequently, BH4 and GCH-1 concentration, NO and O2â¢- production, eNOS association with HSP90, and endothelium-dependent vasodilation were measured. RESULTS: Unexpectedly, eNOS phosphorylation, eNOS-HSP90 association, and O2â¢- production were increased, whereas BH4 and GCH-1 concentration and NO production were reduced in atherosclerosis. D-4F significantly inhibited atherosclerosis, eNOS phosphorylation, eNOS-HSP90 association, and O2â¢- generation but increased NO production and BH4 and GCH-1 concentration. OxLDL reduced NO production and BH4 and GCH-1 concentration but enhanced O2â¢- generation and eNOS association with HSP90, and impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation. D-4F inhibited the overall effects of oxLDL. CONCLUSIONS: Hypercholesterolemia enhanced uncoupled eNOS activity by decreasing GCH-1 concentration, thereby reducing BH4 levels. D-4F reduced uncoupled eNOS activity by increasing BH4 levels through GCH-1 expression and decreasing eNOS phosphorylation and eNOS-HSP90 association.

OBJECTIVE: In this descriptive analysis, we analyzed the epidemiological evidence for PHSM impact on COVID-19 transmission in the US compared to that in ten other countries of varying income levels, population sizes, and geographies. METHODS: We compared PHSM implementation timing and stringency against COVID-19 daily case counts in the US to that in Canada, China, Ethiopia, Japan, Kazakhstan, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, Vietnam, and Zimbabwe from January 1 to November 25, 2020. We descriptively analyzed the impact of border closures, contact tracing, household confinement, mandated face masks, quarantine and isolation, school closures, limited gatherings, and states of emergency on COVID-19 case counts. We also compared the relationship between global socioeconomic indicators and national pandemic trajectories across the 11 countries. PHSM and case count data were derived from various surveillance systems - the Health Intervention Tracking for COVID-19 database, the World Health Organization PHSM database, and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. RESULTS: Implementing a specific package of four PHSM (quarantine and isolation, school closures, household confinement, and limiting social gatherings) early and stringently was observed to coincide with lower cases and transmission duration in Vietnam, Zimbabwe, New Zealand, South Korea, Ethiopia, and Kazakhstan. In contrast, the US implemented few PHSM stringently or early and did not utilize this successful package. Across countries, national income was positively correlated (r=0.624) with cumulative COVID-19 incidence. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that early implementation, consistent execution, adequate duration, and high adherence to PHSMs represent key factors in reducing the spread of COVID-19. While national income may be related to COVID-19 progression, a country's wealth appears less important in controlling the pandemic than taking rapid, centralized, and consistent public health action.","Zweig, Sophia Alison; Zapf, Alexander John; Xu, Hanmeng; Li, Qingfeng; Agarwal, Smisha; Labrique, Alain Bernard; Peters, David H",,,288

238746,SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Febrile Neonates,2020,"The adoption of containment measures to reduce the amplitude of the epidemic peak is a key aspect in tackling the rapid spread of an epidemic. Classical compartmental models must be modified and studied to correctly describe the effects of forced external actions to reduce the impact of the disease. The importance of social structure, such as the age dependence that proved essential in the recent COVID-19 pandemic, must be considered, and in addition, the available data are often incomplete and heterogeneous, so a high degree of uncertainty must be incorporated into the model from the beginning. In this work we address these aspects, through an optimal control formulation of a socially structured epidemic model in presence of uncertain data. After the introduction of the optimal control problem, we formulate an instantaneous approximation of the control that allows us to derive new feedback controlled compartmental models capable of describing the epidemic peak reduction. The need for long-term interventions shows that alternative actions based on the social structure of the system can be as effective as the more expensive global strategy. The timing and intensity of interventions, however, is particularly relevant in the case of uncertain parameters on the actual number of infected people. Simulations related to data from the first wave of the recent COVID-19 outbreak in Italy are presented and discussed.","Albi, Giacomo; Pareschi, Lorenzo; Zanella, Mattia",J Math Biol,,288
239511,Pre-existing diabetes is worse for SARS-CoV-2 infection; an endothelial perspective,2020,"Background: The COVID-19 outbreak has left many people isolated within their homes;these people are turning to social media for news and social connection, which leaves them vulnerable to believing and sharing misinformation. Health-related misinformation threatens adherence to public health messaging, and monitoring its spread on social media is critical to understanding the evolution of ideas that have potentially negative public health impacts. Objective: The aim of this study is to use Twitter data to explore methods to characterize and classify four COVID-19 conspiracy theories and to provide context for each of these conspiracy theories through the first 5 months of the pandemic. Methods: We began with a corpus of COVID-19 tweets (approximately 120 million) spanning late January to early May 2020. We first filtered tweets using regular expressions (n=1.8 million) and used random forest classification models to identify tweets related to four conspiracy theories. Our classified data sets were then used in downstream sentiment analysis and dynamic topic modeling to characterize the linguistic features of COVID-19 conspiracy theories as they evolve over time. Results: Analysis using model-labeled data was beneficial for increasing the proportion of data matching misinformation indicators. Random forest classifier metrics varied across the four conspiracy theories considered (F1 scores between 0.347 and 0.857);this performance increased as the given conspiracy theory was more narrowly defined. We showed that misinformation tweets demonstrate more negative sentiment when compared to nonmisinformation tweets and that theories evolve over time, incorporating details from unrelated conspiracy theories as well as real-world events. Conclusions: Although we focus here on health-related misinformation, this combination of approaches is not specific to public health and is valuable for characterizing misinformation in general, which is an important first step in creating targeted messaging to counteract its spread. Initial messaging should aim to preempt generalized misinformation before it becomes widespread, while later messaging will need to target evolving conspiracy theories and the new facets of each as they become incorporated.","Gerts, Dax Shelley Courtney D.; Parikh, Nidhi Pitts Travis Chrysm Watson Ross Fairchild Geoffrey Nidia Yadria Vaquera Chavez Daughton Ashlynn R.",JMIR Public Health and Surveillance,,288

Challenge hospitals are faced with, in the fight against the virus, is the effective screening of incoming patients. One methodology is the assessment of chest radiography(CXR) images, which usually requires expert radiologists' knowledge. In this paper, we propose an explainable deep neural networks(DNN)-based method for automatic detection of COVID-19 symptoms from CXR images, which we call 'DeepCOVIDExplainer'. We used 16,995 CXR images across 13,808 patients, covering normal, pneumonia, and COVID-19 cases. CXR images are first comprehensively preprocessed, before being augmented and classified with a neural ensemble method, followed by highlighting class-discriminating regions using gradient-guided class activation maps(Grad-CAM++) and layer-wise relevance propagation(LRP). Further, we provide human-interpretable explanations of the predictions. Evaluation results based on hold-out data show that our approach can identify COVID-19 confidently with a positive predictive value(PPV) of 89.61% and recall of 83%, improving over recent comparable approaches. We hope that our findings will be a useful contribution to the fight against COVID-19 and, in more general, towards an increasing acceptance and adoption of AI-assisted applications in the clinical practice.","Karim, Md.

247732,Antibody Development after SARS-CoV-2 Vaccinations in Elderly Patients with Autoimmune Diseases: Data From a Prospective Controlled Cohort Study (preprint),2021,"The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the pathogen responsible of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has devastated public health services and economies worldwide. Despite global efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 is now found in over 200 countries and has caused an upward death toll of over 1 million human lives as of November 2020. To date, only one Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapeutic drug (Remdesivir) and a monoclonal antibody, MAb (Bamlanivimab) are available for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. As with other viruses, studying SARS-CoV-2 requires the use of secondary approaches to detect the presence of the virus in infected cells. To overcome this limitation, we have generated replication-competent recombinant (r)SARS-CoV-2 expressing fluorescent (Venus or mCherry) or bioluminescent (Nluc) reporter genes. Vero E6 cells infected with reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 can be easily detected via fluorescence or luciferase expression and display a good correlation between reporter gene expression and viral replication. Moreover, rSARS-CoV-2 expressing reporter genes have comparable plaque sizes and growth kinetics to those of wild-type virus, rSARS-CoV-2/WT. We used these reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 to demonstrate their feasibility to identify neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) or antiviral drugs. Our results demonstrate that reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 represent an excellent option to identify therapeutics for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2, where reporter gene expression can be used as valid surrogates to track viral infection. Moreover, the ability to manipulate the viral genome opens the feasibility of generating viruses expressing foreign genes for their use as vaccines for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.IMPORTANCE Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the pathogen that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has significantly impacted the human health and economic status worldwide. There is an urgent need to identify effective prophylactics and therapeutics for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated COVID-19 disease. The use of fluorescent- or luciferase-expressing reporter expressing viruses has significantly advanced viral research. Here, we generated recombinant (r)SARS-CoV-2 expressing fluorescent (Venus and mCherry) or luciferase (Nluc) reporter genes and demonstrate that they represent an excellent option to track viral infections in vitro. Importantly, reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 display similar growth kinetics and plaque phenotype that their wild-type counterpart (rSARS-CoV-2/WT), demonstrating their feasibility to identify drugs and/or neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) for the therapeutic treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Henceforth, these reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 can be used to interrogate large libraries of compounds and/or monoclonal antibodies (MAb), in high-throughput screening settings, to identify those with therapeutic potential against SARS-CoV-2.","Chiem, Kevin; Morales Vasquez, Desarey; Park, Jun-Gyu; Platt, Roy Neal; Anderson, Tim; Walter, Mark R; Kobie, James J; Ye, Chengjin; Martinez-Sobrido, Luis",J. virol,,288

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A prospective observational cohort study of 410 consecutive pregnant women with preexisting diabetes categorized according to aspirin prophylaxis strategy, with the prevalence of preeclampsia as primary outcome. In total, 207 women were included after implementation of prophylactic aspirin for all pregnant women with preexisting diabetes in February 2018 (all-cohort). The 203 women included before this date, where aspirin prophylaxis was risk based and only prescribed to selected women (selected-cohort), were studied for comparison. RESULTS: Aspirin was prescribed at â¼10 gestational weeks for 88% (all-cohort) compared with 25% (selected-cohort). HbA1c, parity, chronic hypertension, home blood pressure, microalbuminuria/diabetic nephropathy, and smoking were similar in the two cohorts in early pregnancy. In the all-cohort, fewer women had type 2 diabetes (32% vs. 42%, respectively; P = 0.04) and BMI tended to be lower (P = 0.05). The prevalence of preeclampsia was similar (12% vs. 11%, P = 0.69) in the two cohorts, and this was also the case with stratification for diabetes type. Prevalence of preterm delivery <37 weeks (23% vs. 27%, P = 0.30), preterm preeclampsia (7% vs. 7%, P = 0.96), and infants large (40% vs. 32%, P = 0.07) and small (7% vs. 6%, P = 0.88) for gestational age was similar in the two cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of prophylactic aspirin for all pregnant women with diabetes did not reduce the prevalence of preeclampsia compared with the previous risk-based prophylaxis in this cohort study.","Do, Nicoline C; Vestgaard, Marianne; Ásbjörnsdóttir, Björg; Nørgaard, Sidse K; Andersen, Lise Lotte T; Jensen, Dorte M; Ringholm, Lene; Damm, Peter; Mathiesen, Elisabeth R",Diabetes care,,288

Conclusions: Major burn injury results in immunosuppression and viral infection in a small number of patients. Recognition and antiviral therapy are employed, but additional studies are necessary to improve outcomes in these patients.","Kiley, John L; Chung, Kevin K; Blyth, Dana M",Surg Infect (Larchmt),,288
250428,"Venous thromboembolism in SARS-CoV-2 patients: only a problem in ventilated ICU patients, or is there more to it?",2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has exposed health care inequities in the United States and highlighted the importance of social conditions in shaping the health of individuals. In the field of hepatology, social determinants of health (SDOH) are closely linked to disparities in liver disease prevalence, outcomes, and access to treatment. The economic disruption and physical distancing policies brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic have further exacerbated these disparities, and may have long-lasting health consequences for marginalized patients with chronic liver disease. There are several ways that hepatology providers can bridge the gap in health equity through addressing SDOH, extending from the individual to the community and societal levels. Interventions at the individual level include implementation of systematic screening for social barriers in our hepatology practices to identify gaps in the care cascade. At the community and societal levels, interventions include creating collaborative partnerships with public health workers to expand health care access to the community, increasing funding for research investigating the association of SDOH, health disparities, and liver disease, engaging in advocacy to support policy reform that tackles the upstream social determinants, and addressing racism and implicit bias. As hepatology practices adapt to the ""new normal,"" now is the time for us to address our patients' social needs within the context of health care delivery and reimagine ways in which to provide care to best serve our most vulnerable patients with liver disease in the COVID-19 era and beyond.","Kardashian, Ani; Wilder, Julius; Terrault, Norah A; Price, Jennifer C",Hepatology (Baltim.),,288

Many lives have already been lost, and the global economy is at stake. In the absence of vaccine, social distancing and total lock down is the current mainstay in efforts to mitigate and flatten the epidemic curves. Several countries across the globe are currently implementing social distancing and total lock downs. However, what is social distancing and lock down? Does it work? Whom does it benefit? We expound on these questions and conclude that social distancing and lock down benefit the local and international community alike. Moreover, we hypothesis that evacuations may facilitate international spread of a highly contagious disease of pandemic potential.","Musinguzi, Geofrey; Asamoah, Benedict Oppong",Electro. J. Gen.

Critically, successful adaptation helps to reduce such symptoms to baseline, preventing long-term psychiatric disorders. It is thus important to understand whether and which psychiatric symptoms show transient elevations, and which persist long-term and become chronically heightened. At particular risk for the latter trajectory are symptom dimensions directly affected by the pandemic, such as obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms. In this longitudinal large-scale study (N = 406), we assessed how OC, anxiety and depression symptoms changed throughout the first pandemic wave in a sample of the general UK public. We further examined how these symptoms affected pandemic-related information seeking and adherence to governmental guidelines. We show that scores in all psychiatric domains were initially elevated, but showed distinct longitudinal change patterns. Depression scores decreased, and anxiety plateaued during the first pandemic wave, while OC symptoms further increased, even after the ease of Covid-19 restrictions. These OC symptoms were directly linked to Covid-related information seeking, which gave rise to higher adherence to government guidelines. This increase of OC symptoms in this non-clinical sample shows that the domain is disproportionately affected by the pandemic. We discuss the long-term impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on public mental health, which calls for continued close observation of symptom development.","Loosen, Alisa M; Skvortsova, Vasilisa; Hauser, Tobias U",Transl Psychiatry,,288

Wastewater-based COVID-19 epidemiology programs have been initiated in many countries to provide public health agencies with a complementary disease tracking metric and non-discriminating surveillance tool. However, their efficacy in prospectively capturing resurgences following a period of low prevalence is unclear. In this study, the SARS-CoV-2 viral signal was measured in primary clarified sludge harvested every two days at the City of Ottawa's water resource recovery facility during the summer of 2020, when clinical testing recorded daily percent positivity below 1%. In late July, increases of >400% in normalized SARS-CoV-2 RNA signal in wastewater were identified 48 h prior to reported >300% increases in positive cases that were retrospectively attributed to community-acquired infections. During this resurgence period, SARS-CoV-2 RNA signal in wastewater preceded the reported >160% increase in community hospitalizations by approximately 96 h. This study supports wastewater-based COVID-19 surveillance of populations in augmenting the efficacy of diagnostic testing, which can suffer from sampling biases or timely reporting as in the case of hospitalization census.","D039,; Aoust, Patrick M; Graber, Tyson E; Mercier, Elisabeth; Montpetit, Danika; Alexandrov, Ilya; Neault, Nafisa; Baig, Aiman Tariq; Mayne, Janice; Zhang, Xu; Alain, Tommy; Servos, Mark R; Srikanthan, Nivetha; MacKenzie, Malcolm; Figeys, Daniel; Manuel, Douglas; Jüni, Peter; MacKenzie, Alex E; Delatolla, Robert",Sci Total Environ,,288

In this study, we aim to develop models addressing the effects of recent Covid-19 related changes in the communities such as reopening states, practicing social-distancing, and staying-at-home orders Our models account for the fact that changes to these policies which can lead to a surge of coronavirus cases and deaths, especially in the United States Specifically, in this paper we develop a novel generalized mathematical model and several explicit models considering the effects of recent reopening states, staying-at-home orders and social-distancing practice of different communities along with a set of selected indicators such as the total number of coronavirus recovered and new cases that can estimate the daily death toll and total number of deaths in the United States related to Covid-19 virus We compare the modeling results among the developed models based on several existing criteria The model also can be used to predict the number of death toll in Italy and the United Kingdom (UK) The results show very encouraging predictability for the proposed models in this study The model predicts that 128,500 to 140,100 people in the United States will have died of Covid-19 by July 4, 2020 The model also predicts that between 137,900 and 154,000 people will have died of Covid-19 by July 31, and 148,500 to 169,700 will have died by the end of August 2020, as a result of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that causes COVID-19 based on the Covid-19 death data available on June 13, 2020 The model also predicts that 34,900 to 37,200 people in Italy will have died of Covid-19 by July 4, and 36,900 to 40,400 people will have died by the end of August based on the data available on June 13, 2020 The model also predicts that between 43,500 and 46,700 people in the United Kingdom will have died of Covid-19 by July 4, and 48,700 to 51,900 people will have died by the end of August, as a result of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that causes COVID-19 based on the data available on June 13, 2020 The model can serve as a framework to help policy makers a scientific approach in quantifying decision-makings related to Covid-19 affairs © 2020, International Journal of Mathemat cal, Engin","Pham, H.","International Journal of Mathematical, Engineering and Management Sciences",,288

This paper provides statistical analysis of the air quality data monitored by the Environment Agency - Abu Dhabi (EAD) during the first 10 months of 2020, comparing the different stages of the preventive measures. Ground monitoring data is compared with satellite images and mobility indicators. The study shows a drastic decrease during lockdown in the concentration of the gaseous pollutants analysed (NO2, SO2, CO, and C6H6) that aligns with the results reported in other international cities and metropolitan areas. However, particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) averaged concentrations followed a markedly different trend from the gaseous pollutants, indicating a larger influence from natural events (sand and dust storms) and other anthropogenic sources. The ozone (O3) levels increased during the lockdown, showing the complexity of O3 formation. The end of lockdown led to an increase of the mobility and the air pollution; however, air pollutant concentrations remained in lower levels than during the same period of 2019. The results in this study show the large impact of human activities on the quality of air and present an opportunity for policymakers and decision-makers to design stimulus packages to overcome the economic slow-down, with strategies to accelerate the transition to resilient, low-emission economies and societies more connected to the nature that protect human health and the environment.

While acute care and intensive care units are the main pillars of the early response to the disease, rehabilitative medicine should play an important part in allowing COVID-19 survivors to reduce disability and optimize the function of acute hospital setting. AIM: To share the experience and the international perspective of different rehabilitation centers, treating COVID-19 survivors. DESIGN: Not applicable. POPULATION: COVID-19 survivors. METHODS: A group of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation specialists from eleven different countries in Europe and North America have shared their clinical experience in dealing with COVID-19 survivors and how they have managed the re-organization of rehabilitation services. RESULTS: In our experience the most important sequelae of severe and critical forms of COVID-19 are: 1) respiratory; 2) cognitive, central and peipheral nervous system; 3) deconditioning; 4) critical illness related myopathy and neuropathy; 5) dysphagia; 6) joint stiffness and pain; 7) psychiatric.

263884,"Origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains a mystery, WHO investigation ruling nothing out",2021,"INTRODUCTION: An unidentified cluster of pneumonia was identified in Wuhan city of China in the last week of December 2019, named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-COV-2). The current study explored the predictors associated with critical illness and mortality based on symptoms at the time of admission and initial physical examination findings in patients with SARS-CoV-2. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 249 records of laboratory-confirmed SARS-COV-2 patients were analyzed. Demographic profile and findings of initial physical examination were collected and analyzed. Bivariate logistic and multivariable stepwise forward regression analysis was used to identify the predictors of critical illness and mortality. RESULTS: A total of 249 records of SARS-COV-2 patients were retrospectively studied, of whom 66 (26.5%) developed a critical illness, and 58 (23.29%) died. The mean age of patients was 45.15 (16.34) years; 171 (68.71%) were men. From 27 potential predictors for developing a critical illness, 15 were reported independent predictors for critical illness, and 13 were for increased risk of mortality. Stepwise forward regression reported dyspnea as a single strongest predictor (OR, 5.800, 95% CI-2.724-12.346; p = 0.001, R2 = 0.272) to develop critical illness. Likewise, the respiratory rate was alone reported as a strong predictor (OR, 1.381, 95% CI- 1.251-1.525; p = 0.000, R2 = 0.329) for mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Coronavirus disease is a new challenge to the medical fraternity, leading to significant morbidity and mortality. Knowledge of potential risk factors could help clinicians assess patients' risk with unfavourable outcomes and improve hospitalization decisions in the early stage.","Bairwa, Mukesh; Kumar, Rajesh; Ajmal, Mohammed; Bahurupi, Yogesh; Kant, Ravi",J Infect Public Health,,288
264233,"Large-scale, molecular and serological SARS-CoV-2 screening of healthcare workers in a 4-site public hospital in Belgium after COVID-19 outbreak",2020,"This paper analyzes the social crisis of the Covid-19 epidemic and the government responses in China from a performance perspective. It argues that the epidemic outbreak in late December 2019 initiated a highly contested social drama, in which loyalty was tested, political order questioned, and ideological crisis made visible. The numerous netizens and residents drew on a wide-ranging repertoire of discourses, symbols, and narratives to heighten public spectacles of suffering and sympathy, which placed extensive blame on the lies, negligence, and censorship of the government. Nonetheless, within the short span of three months, the conflictive, cacophonous social drama was overshadowed and subsumed by a hegemonic political performance of national victory, unity, and patriotism, framed and channeled by state propaganda, censorship, ritual, and practical policies. Social protests in cyberspace continued in even more dramatic forms. But these it only constituted sporadic performances of resistance, rather than a monumental social drama that challenged the fundamental political order.","Liu, Jiacheng",Crit. Asian Stud.,,288

The study was performed on 271 samples representative of the Italian general population and identified seven variants (rs140764737, rs142164099, rs2069849, rs142759801, rs190436077, rs148171375, rs13306435) in IL6 and five variants (rs2228144, rs2229237, rs2228145, rs28730735, rs143810642) within IL6R, respectively. These variants have been predicted to affect the expression and binding ability of IL6 and IL6R. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) showed that IL6 and IL6R appeared to be implicated in several pathogenetic mechanisms associated with COVID-19 severity and mortality as well as with neurodegenerative diseases mediated by neuroinflammation. Thus, the availability of IL6-IL6R-related biomarkers for COVID-19 may be helpful to counteract harmful complications and prevent multiorgan failure. At the same time, IL6-IL6R-related biomarkers could also be useful for assessing the susceptibility and progression of neuroinflammatory disorders and undertake the most suitable treatment strategies to improve patients' prognosis and quality of life. In conclusion, this study showed how IL6 pleiotropic activity could be exploited to meet different clinical needs and realize personalized medicine protocols for chronic, age-related and modern public health emergencies.","Strafella, Claudia; Caputo, Valerio; Termine, Andrea; Barati, Shila; Caltagirone, Carlo; Giardina, Emiliano; Cascella, Raffaella",,,288

270829,"Genomic elucidation of a COVID-19 resurgence and local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Guangzhou, China",2021,"Like many governments in this COVID-19 pandemic, the Nigerian government imposed a lockdown on the country. As a consequence of the lockdown, many businesses shutdown and effectively had no source of revenue. Yet, without receiving any bailout or palliatives from the government, these businesses are required to meet their tax obligations to the government. Bearing in mind that this time (COVID-19 era) is different, one wonders what is required of businesses in view of the taxation problem and the social contract between the businesspersons and the government. In view of social contract obligations, in this COVID-19 pandemic should businesses pay tax to a government that seems to have delegitimised itself by its exploitative actions in terms of taxation and delinquent omission in terms of the provision of public goods and social services? The Nigerian government at all tiers (federal, state and local) seldom respect the essence of taxation. Therefore, businesses often pay tax for nothing. For many businesses, as far as taxation is concerned, to pay or not to pay? that is the question. This article is aimed at teasing out this taxation problem that may or may not be a moral dilemma. In view of certain ethical considerations, this article shows why in spite of social contract obligations, there is no consensus or canonical agreement on whether, as law-abiding citizens and juridical persons (legal entities), businesspersons and businesses ought to or ought not to pay tax to the Nigerian government in this COVID-19 pandemic.","Abumere, Frank Aragbonfoh",Philosophia (Ramat Gan),,288

271311,SARS-CoV-2 infection-related diabetes mellitus,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic may adversely impact the mental health of health care workers (HCWs). To address this issue, it is essential to determine levels of anxiety, depression, and traumatic stress, and sources of stress, and to identify subgroups of HCWs at a higher risk of adverse mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of symptoms of mental illness in HCWs in the area surrounding Detroit, Michigan. The online survey included questions about demographics, health and clinical factors, and sources of stress. Several tools were used to assess psychiatric symptoms among HCWs, including the Perceived Stress Scale, the Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item assessment, and the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5. The adequacy of personal protective equipment, patient resources, and training for highly contagious diseases were rated. RESULTS: The sample (N = 129) was predominantly female (51.2%) and White (65.9%), with 30.2% screening positive for clinical follow-up to assess anxiety, 20.9% for moderate to severe depression, and 16.3% for elevated traumatic stress. Differences were found by self-reported psychiatric diagnosis and chronic conditions, and role on treatment teams. CONCLUSIONS: Frontline HCWs demonstrate high levels of stress and trauma symptoms. Timely screening and accommodations may be needed during health care crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Daviskiba, Sydney E; MacKenzie, Megan A; Dow, Miriam; Johnston, Peyton; Balon, Richard; Javanbakht, Arash; Arfken, Cynthia L",Ann Clin Psychiatry,,288

DESIGN: Population-based retrospective cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Linked, person-level health system administrative data on older adults who were newly diagnosed with dementia and resided in an assisted living facility in Ontario, Canada, from 2014 to 2019 (n = 977). METHODS: Access to a dementia care program in an assisted living facility (n = 57) was examined. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression with robust standard errors clustered on the assisted living facility was used to model the time to transition to a nursing home from the new dementia diagnosis. RESULTS: There were 11.8 transitions to a nursing home per 100 person-years among older adults who resided in an assisted living facility with a dementia care program, compared with 20.5 transitions to a nursing home per 100 person-years among older adults who resided in an assisted living facility without a dementia care program. After adjustment for relevant characteristics at baseline, older adults who resided in an assisted living facility with a dementia care program had a 40% lower rate of transition to a nursing home (hazard ratio 0.60, 95% confidence interval 0.44, 0.81), compared with those in an assisted living facility without such a program at any point during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The rate of transition to a nursing home was significantly lower among older adults who resided in an assisted living facility that offered a dementia care program. These findings support the expansion of dementia care programs in assisted living facilities.","Manis, Derek R; Rahim, Ahmad; Poss, Jeffrey W; Bielska, Iwona A; Bronskill, Susan E; Tarride, Jean-Éric; Abelson, Julia; Costa, Andrew P",J.

276214,Maternal and neonatal SARS-CoV-2 antibodies assessment after mRNA maternal vaccination in the third trimester of pregnancy,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Although the initial reports of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases in children described that children were largely protected from severe manifestations, clusters of pediatric cases of severe systemic hyperinflammation and shock related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection began to be reported in the latter half of April 2020. A novel syndrome called ""multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children"" (MIS-C) shares common clinical features with other well-defined syndromes, including Kawasaki disease (KD), toxic shock syndrome (TSS), and secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). Our objective was to develop a protocol for the evaluation, treatment, and follow-up of patients with MIS-C. METHODS: The protocol was developed by a multidisciplinary team. We convened a multidisciplinary working group with representation from the departments of pediatric critical care, cardiology, rheumatology, surgery, gastroenterology, hematology, immunology, infectious disease, and neurology. Our protocol and recommendations were based on the literature and our experiences with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. After an agreement was reached and the protocol was implemented, revisions were made on the basis of expert feedback. CONCLUSION: Children may experience acute cardiac decompensation or other organ system failure due to this severe inflammatory condition. Therefore, patients with severe symptoms of MIS-C should be managed in a pediatric intensive care setting, as rapid clinical deterioration may occur. Therapeutic approaches for MIS-C should be tailored depending on the patients' phenotypes. Plasmapheresis may be useful as a standard treatment to control hypercytokinemia in cases of MIS-C with severe symptoms. Long-term follow-up of patients with cardiac involvement is required to identify any sequelae of MIS-C.","Emeksiz, Serhat; Çelikel Acar, Banu; Kibar, Ayse Esin; Özkaya Parlakay, Aslinur; Perk, Oktay; Bayhan, Gülsüm Iclal; Cinel, Güzin; Özbek, Namik; Azili, Müjdem Nur; Çelikel, Elif; Akça, Halise; Dibek Misirlioglu, Emine; Bayrakçi, Umut Selda; Çetin, Ibrahim Ilker; Çitak Kurt, Aysegül Nese; Boyraz, Mehmet; Hizli, Samil; Senel, Emrah",Int J Clin Pract,,288

RESULTS: 431 consecutive adult patients were admitted. Female patients were 119 (27.6%) with a mean age of 67.0 ± 14.5 years (vs 67.8 ± 12.5 for males, p = 0.54). Previous history of myocardial infarction, vasculopathy and former smoking habits were more common for males. At the time of admission PaO2/FiO2 was similar between men and women (228 [IQR, 134-273] vs 238 mmHg [150-281], p = 0.28). Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) assistance was needed in the first 24 h more frequently in male patients (25.7% vs 13.0%; p = 0.006). Overall 28-day mortality was 26.1% in women and 38.1% in men (p = 0.018). Gender did not result an independent predictor of death once the parameters related to disease severity at presentation were included in the multivariable analysis (p = 0.898). Accordingly, the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis in female and male patients requiring CPAP or non-invasive ventilation in the first 24 h did not find a significant difference (p = 0.687). CONCLUSION: Hospitalized women are less likely to die from Covid-19; however, once severe disease occurs, the risk of dying is similar to men. Further studies are needed to better investigate the role of gender in clinical course and outcome of Covid-19.","Raimondi, Federico; Novelli, Luca; Ghirardi, Arianna; Russo, Filippo Maria; Pellegrini, Dario; Biza, Roberta; Trapasso, Roberta; Giuliani, Lisa; Anelli, Marisa; Amoroso, Mariangela; Allegri, Chiara; Imeri, Gianluca; Sanfilippo, Claudia; Comandini, Sofia; Hila, England; Manesso, Leonardo; Gandini, Lucia; Mandelli, Pietro; Monti, Martina; Gori, Mauro; Senni, Michele; Lorini, Ferdinando Luca; Rizzi, Marco; Barbui, Tiziano; Paris, Laura; Rambaldi, Alessandro; Cosentini, Roberto; Guagliumi, Giulio; Cesa, Simonetta; Colledan, Michele; Sessa, Maria; Masciulli, Arianna; Gavazzi, Antonello; Buoro, Sabrina; Remuzzi, Giuseppe; Ruggenenti, Piero; Callegaro, Annapaola; Gianatti, Andrea; Farina, Claudio; Bellasi, Antonio; Sironi, Sandro; Fagiuoli, Stefano; Di Marco, Fabiano",BMC Pulm Med,,288

Issues about whether healthcare resources can accommodate extended shared decision-making processes are yet to be resolved. COVID-19 has now stepped into this arena of uncertainty, adding more complexity. U.K. public health responses to the pandemic raise important questions about professional standards regarding how the obtaining and recording of consent might change or be maintained in such emergency conditions, particularly in settings where equipment, medicines, and appropriately trained or specialized staff are in short supply. Such conditions have important implications for the professional capacity and knowledge available to discuss the risks and benefits of and alternatives to proposed treatment with patients. The government's drive to expedite the recruitment to wards of medical students nearing the end of their studies, as well as inviting retired practitioners back into practice, raises questions about the ability of such healthcare providers to engage fully in shared decision-making.This article explores whether the legal duty on healthcare practitioners to disclose the material risks of a proposed medical treatment to a patient should be upheld during pandemic conditions or whether the pre-eminence of patient autonomy should be partly sacrificed in such exceptional circumstances. We argue that measures to protect public health and to respect autonomous decision-making are not mutually exclusive and that there are good reasons to maintain professional standards in obtaining consent to treatment even during acute pressures on public health systems.","Devaney, Sarah; Miola, Jose; Cave, Emma; Purshouse, Craig; Heywood, Rob",J Bioeth Inq,,288
283754,Ileum Perforation in Crohn's Disease Patient During SARS-Cov-2 Infection,2020,"COVID-19 is well known for its respiratory symptoms, but severe presentations can alter haemostasis, causing acute end-organ damage with poor outcomes. Among its various neurological presentations, cerebrovascular events often present as small-vessel strokes. Although uncommon, in predisposed individuals, large-vessel occlusions (LVOs) can occur as a possible consequence of direct viral action (viral burden or antigenic structure) or virus-induced cytokine storm. Subtle presentations and complicated stroke care pathways continue to exist, delaying timely care. We present a unique case of COVID-19 LVO manifesting as an acute confusional state in an elderly man in April 2020. CT angiography revealed 'de novo' occlusions of the left internal carotid artery and proximal right vertebral artery, effectively blocking anterior and posterior circulations. Delirium can lead to inaccurate stroke scale assessments and prolong initiation of COVID-19 stroke care pathways. Future studies are needed to look into the temporal relationship between confusion and neurological manifestations.","Deliwala, Smit Sunil; Hussain, Murtaza; Ponnapalli, Anoosha; Awuah, Dominic; Dawood, Thair; Bachuwa, Ghassan",BMJ case reports,,288

This work provides a didactic proposal to perform Expressive Movement & Creative Dance (EMCD) at home adaptable to distinct educational levels and useful as a valuable online or face-to-face education experience even when the coronavirus crisis ends. The proposal is based on the Laban Movement Analysis, the Theatre of the Oppressed, and Lipdub. It seeks to develop students' own artistic body language, emotional intelligence, healthy physical activity and social awareness. Furthermore, it intends to promote the creation of a new social movement (#VIDLOP) using art and popular media as empowering and democratic channels for building a better world.

285829,Bilateral Central Retinal Artery Occlusion Secondary to SARS-CoV-2 Infection in the Early and Late Periods: A Case Report,2021,"COVID-19 is a multisystem disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. It has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020 and the outbreak still keeps its impacts worldwide. Behçet disease (BD) is a multi-systemic vasculitis involving the skin, mucosa, eyes, joints, nervous system, cardiovascular system, and gastrointestinal system. The precise etiopathogenesis of the disorder is unknown but autoimmunity is believed to play a key role. A considerable part of patients with BD are susceptible to immunosuppression and are more predisposed to infections than healthy individuals. Hence, the protection and control measures for patients with BD against the COVID-19 are of the utmost significance. Given the requirement to balance proper treatment of BD with the smallest risk of COVID-19 associated mortality and morbidity, we aimed to review the management of BD in the era of the pandemic with a special focus on treatment considerations. According to current expert recommendations, there is no reason to discontinue topical treatments, colchicine, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Systemic steroids can be used at the lowest possible dose if needed. Ongoing treatments can be continued unchanged in patients with no suspected or confirmed COVID-19. In cases with COVID-19 symptoms, immunosuppressive and biological agents can be temporarily stopped but the decision should be made on a case by case basis. Considering their potential beneficial effects on the course of COVID-19, colchicine, pentoxifylline, and dapsone can be considered as safe treatment options in BD.","Elmas, Ömer Faruk; Demirbas, Abdullah; Bagcier, Fatih; Türsen, Ümit; Atasoy, Mustafa; Dursun, Recep; Lotti, Torello",Dermatol Ther,,288

These drastic measures were successful in ""flattening the curve"" and maintaining the previous rate of coronavirus disease 2019 infections and deaths. To date, the effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on neurotrauma has not been reported. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed hospital admissions from Ryder Trauma Center at Jackson Memorial Hospital, during the months of March and April from 2016 to 2020. Specifically, we identified all patients who had cranial neurotrauma consisting of traumatic brain injury and/or skull fractures, as well as spinal neurotrauma consisting of vertebral fractures and/or spinal cord injury. We then performed chart review to determine mechanism of injury and if emergent surgical intervention was required. RESULTS: Compared with previous years, we saw a significant decline in the number of neurotraumas during the pandemic, with a 62% decline after the lockdown began. The number of emergent neurotrauma surgical cases also significantly decreased by 84% in the month of April. Interestingly, although the number of vehicular traumas decreased by 77%, there was a significant 100% increase in the number of gunshot wounds. CONCLUSIONS: Population seclusion had a direct effect on the frequency of neurotrauma, whereas the change in relative proportion of certain mechanisms may be associated with the psychosocial effects of social distancing and quarantine.","Figueroa, Javier M; Boddu, James; Kader, Michael; Berry, Katherine; Kumar, Vignessh; Ayala, Veronica; Vanni, Steven; Jagid, Jonathan",World neurosurgery (Online),,288
288193,Chloroquine Ingestion to Prevent SARS-CoV-2 Infection: A Report of Two Cases,2021,"We present a putative link between maternal COVID-19 infection in the peripartum period and rapid maternal deterioration with early organ dysfunction and coagulopathy. The current pandemic with SARS-CoV-2 has already resulted in high numbers of critically ill patients and deaths in the non-pregnant population, mainly due to respiratory failure. During viral outbreaks, pregnancy poses a uniquely increased risk to women due to changes to immune function, alongside physiological adaptive alterations, such as increased oxygen consumption and edema of the respiratory tract. The laboratory derangements may be reminiscent of HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count) syndrome, and thus knowledge of the COVID-19 relationship is paramount for appropriate diagnosis and management. In addition to routine measurements of D-dimers, prothrombin time, and platelet count in all patients presenting with COVID-19 as per International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) guidance, monitoring of activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and fibrinogen levels should be considered in pregnancy, as highlighted in this report. These investigations in SARS-CoV-2-positive pregnant women are vital, as their derangement may signal a more severe COVID-19 infection, and may warrant pre-emptive admission and consideration of delivery to achieve maternal stabilization.","Vlachodimitropoulou Koumoutsea, Evangelia; Vivanti, Alexandre J; Shehata, Nadine; Benachi, Alexandra; Le Gouez, Agnes; Desconclois, Celine; Whittle, Wendy; Snelgrove, John; Malinowski, Ann Kinga",J Thromb Haemost,,288

Yet the potential impact of suspending elective surgery on ICU bed capacity is unclear. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 5 years of New York State data on ICU usage. Descriptions of ICU utilization and mechanical ventilation were stratified by admission type (elective surgery, emergent/urgent/trauma surgery, and medical admissions) and by geographic location (New York metropolitan region versus the rest of New York State). Data are presented as absolute numbers and percentages and all adult and pediatric ICU patients were included. RESULTS: Overall, ICU admissions in New York State were seen in 10.1% of all hospitalizations (n = 1,232,986/n = 12,251,617) and remained stable over a 5-year period from 2011 to 2015. Among n = 1,232,986 ICU stays, sources of ICU admission included elective surgery (13.4%, n = 165,365), emergent/urgent admissions/trauma surgery (28.0%, n = 345,094), and medical admissions (58.6%, n = 722,527). Ventilator utilization was seen in 26.3% (n = 323,789/n = 1232,986) of all ICU patients of which 6.4% (n = 20,652), 32.8% (n = 106,186), and 60.8% (n = 196,951) was for patients from elective, emergent, and medical admissions, respectively. New York City holds the majority of ICU bed capacity (70.0%; n = 2496/n = 3566) in New York State. CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing elective surgery comprised a small fraction of ICU bed and mechanical ventilation use in New York State. Suspension of elective surgeries in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may thus have a minor impact on ICU capacity when compared to other sources of ICU admission such as emergent/urgent admissions/trauma surgery and medical admissions. More study is needed to better understand how best to maximize ICU capacity for pandemics requiring heavy use of critical care resources.","Poeran, Jashvant; Zhong, Haoyan; Wilson, Lauren; Liu, Jiabin; Memtsoudis, Stavros G",Anesth Analg,,288

Method: General population samples of 595 Swiss and 639 Israeli participants were recruited and completed an online self-report survey. Moderated Mediation using multigroup path analysis models for the two samples were conducted and compared using AMOS. Results: The multigroup path model had excellent fit for both samples. The different paths were moderated by country affiliation. Higher levels of COVID-19-related fear were associated with negative affect to an equal extent in both samples. COVID-19-related fear was associated with higher reports of institutional betrayal and a lower locus of control in both samples. Higher COVID-19-related fear was associated with lower fatalism in the Swiss sample only. In both samples, institutional betrayal mediated the association between COVID-19-related fear and negative affect, however, locus of control was a mediator in the Israeli sample only. Conclusion: The current results suggest that the reaction of the government was of crucial importance with regard to the emotional state of the two populations. Interestingly, while in the context of adversity fatalism is generally considered a risk factor for mental health, during the time of the pandemic it seems to have had protective qualities among the Swiss population. Interventions that strengthen the personal locus of control have the potential to mitigate the negative affect in Israel but not in Switzerland. Despite the fact that COVID-19 is a global phenomenon, prevention and intervention strategies should be adjusted to local contexts.","Bachem, Rahel; Tsur, Noga; Levin, Yafit; Abu-Raiya, Hisham; Maercker, Andreas",Front Psychiatry,,288
297918,Immunotherapy may protect cancer patients from SARS-CoV-2 infection: a single-center retrospective analysis,2021,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 challenges and needs required health systems to rapidly redesign the delivery of care. OBJECTIVE: To describe our approach in using health information technology to provide a continuum of services during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our health system deployed four COVID-19 telehealth programs, and four biomedical informatics innovations to screen and care for COVID-19 patients. Using programmatic and electronic health record data we describe the implementation and initial utilization. RESULTS: Through collaboration across multi-disciplinary teams and strategic planning, four telehealth program initiatives have been deployed in response to COVID-19: virtual urgent care screening, remote patient monitoring for COVID-19 positive patients, continuous virtual monitoring to reduce workforce risk and utilization of personal protective equipment, and the transition of outpatient care to telehealth. Biomedical Informatics was integral to our institutional response in supporting clinical care through new and reconfigured technologies. Through linking the telehealth systems and the electronic health record, we have the ability to monitor and track patients through a continuum of COVID-19 services. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 has facilitated the rapid expansion and utilization of telehealth and health informatics services. We anticipate that patients and providers will view enhanced telehealth services as an essential aspect of the healthcare system. Continuation of telehealth payment models at federal and private levels will be a key factor in whether this new uptake is sustained. CONCLUSION: There are substantial benefits in utilizing telehealth during the COVID-19, including the ability to rapidly scale the number of patients being screened and providing continuity of care.","Ford, Dee; Harvey, Jillian B; McElligott, James; King, Kathryn; Simpson, Kit N; Valenta, Shawn; Warr, Emily H; Walsh, Tasia; Debenham, Ellen; Teasdale, Carla; Meystre, Stephane; Obeid, Jihad S; Lenert, Leslie A",J. am. med. inform. assoc,,288

Five mothers were recruited as participants and interviewed online, as the data obtained were examined through the use of thematic analysis. Also, three main themes were shown, (1) Mothers' experience in implementing home education, as regards adaptability and burden of caregiving, (2) The constraints in home education implementation, as regards maladaptive behaviours of ASD and emerging negative emotions, (3) The efforts to alleviate barriers, as regards problem-focused and religious copings. Also, the implementation of home education during the pandemic was less than optimal, due to the increase in maladaptive behaviours of the autistic children, low adaptability, the burden of caregiving, and emerging negative emotions. Appropriate coping strategies were also observed to help mothers in alleviating the constraints to implementing home education and parenting stress.","Daulay, Nurussakinah",Res Dev Disabil,,288
299370,Incidence and characterization of acute pulmonary embolism in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia: A multicenter Italian experience,2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an ongoing global pandemic in over 200 countries and territories, which has resulted in a great public health concern across the international community. Analysis of X-ray imaging data can play a critical role in timely and accurate screening and fighting against COVID-19. Supervised deep learning has been successfully applied to recognize COVID-19 pathology from X-ray imaging datasets. However, it requires a substantial amount of annotated X-ray images to train models, which is often not applicable to data analysis for emerging events such as COVID-19 outbreak, especially in the early stage of the outbreak. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a two-path semi-supervised deep learning model, ssResNet, based on Residual Neural Network (ResNet) for COVID-19 image classification, where two paths refer to a supervised path and an unsupervised path, respectively. Moreover, we design a weighted supervised loss that assigns higher weight for the minority classes in the training process to resolve the data imbalance. Experimental results on a large-scale of X-ray image dataset COVIDx demonstrate that the proposed model can achieve promising performance even when trained on very few labeled training images.","Nwuso, Lucy; Li, Xiangfang; Qian, Lijun; Kim, Seungchan; Dong, Xishuang",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.06140v1.pdf,288

301394,Comparable Specimen Collection from Both Ends of At-Home Midturbinate Swabs,2021,"Driven by an increasing number of connected medical devices, Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), as an application of Internet of Things (IoT) in healthcare, is developed to help collect, analyze and transmit medical data. During the outbreak of pandemic like COVID-19, IoMT can be useful to monitor the status of patients and detect main symptoms remotely, by using various smart sensors. However, due to the lack of emotional care in current IoMT, it is still a challenge to reach an efficient medical process. Especially under COVID-19, there is a need to monitor emotion status among particular people like elderly. In this work, we propose an emotion-aware healthcare monitoring system in IoMT, based on brainwaves. With the fast development of EEG (electroencephalography) sensors in current headsets and some devices, brainwave-based emotion detection becomes feasible. The IoMT devices are used to capture the brainwaves of a patient in a scenario of smart home. Also, our system involves the analysis of touch behavior as the second layer to enhance the brainwave-based emotion recognition. In the user study with 60 participants, the results indicate the viability and effectiveness of our approach in detecting emotion like comfortable and uncomfortable, which can complement existing emotion-aware healthcare applications and mechanisms.

306133,SARS-COV-2 antibody dynamics and B-cell memory response over-time in COVID-19 convalescent subjects,2021,"CONTEXT: Existing hospitalization ratios for COVID-19 typically use case counts in the denominator, which problematically underestimates total infections because asymptomatic and mildly infected persons rarely get tested. As a result, surge models that rely on case counts to forecast hospital demand may be inaccurately influencing policy and decision-maker action. OBJECTIVE: Based on SARS-CoV-2 prevalence data derived from a statewide random sample (as opposed to relying on reported case counts), we determine the infection-hospitalization ratio (IHR), defined as the percentage of infected individuals who are hospitalized, for various demographic groups in Indiana. Furthermore, for comparison, we show the extent to which case-based hospitalization ratios, compared with the IHR, overestimate the probability of hospitalization by demographic group. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of statewide prevalence data from Indiana, COVID-19 hospitalization data extracted from a statewide health information exchange, and all reported COVID-19 cases to the state health department. SETTING: State of Indiana as of April 30, 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Demographic-stratified IHRs and case-hospitalization ratios. RESULTS: The overall IHR was 2.1% and varied more by age than by race or sex. Infection-hospitalization ratio estimates ranged from 0.4% for those younger than 40 years to 9.2% for those older than 60 years. Hospitalization rates based on case counts overestimated the IHR by a factor of 10, but this overestimation differed by demographic groups, especially age. CONCLUSIONS: In this first study of the IHR based on population prevalence, our results can improve forecasting models of hospital demand-especially in preparation for the upcoming winter period when an increase in SARS CoV-2 infections is expected.","Menachemi, Nir; Dixon, Brian E; Wools-Kaloustian, Kara K; Yiannoutsos, Constantin T; Halverson, Paul K",J Public Health Manag Pract,,288

getting to know your customer;Step Two - customer retention;Step Three - interaction with clients The implementation of all three stages should improve quality of servicing customers of the restaurant sector This paper analyzes the consequences of COVID-19 for the restaurant industry and suggests the main ways to overcome them The necessity and expediency of using social media marketing in the restaurant industry is proved Conclusions about the feasibility of introducing special measures to normalize the financial situation, overcome the crisis and provide return on production costs are made Among these measures, the use of social media marketing, improvement of effectiveness of advertising on the Internet and establishment of communication with customers are singled out","Lazebnyk, I.

Within this retrospective study, we analyzed inpatient hospital admissions across 18 German university hospitals during the 2020 lockdown period compared to 2018. Patients admitted to hospital between January 1 and May 31, 2020 and the corresponding periods in 2018 and 2019 were included in this study. Data derived from electronic health records were collected and analyzed using the data integration center infrastructure implemented in the university hospitals that are part of the four consortia funded by the German Medical Informatics Initiative. Admissions were grouped and counted by ICD 10 chapters and specific reasons for treatment at each site. Pooled aggregated data were centrally analyzed with descriptive statistics to compare absolute and relative differences between time periods of different years. The results illustrate how care process adoptions depended on the COVID-19 epidemiological situation and the criticality of the disease. Overall inpatient hospital admissions decreased by 35% in weeks 1 to 4 and by 30.3% in weeks 5 to 8 after the lockdown announcement compared to 2018. Even hospital admissions for critical care conditions such as malignant cancer treatments were reduced. We also noted a high reduction of emergency admissions such as myocardial infarction (38.7%), whereas the reduction in stroke admissions was smaller (19.6%). In contrast, we observed a considerable reduction in admissions for non-critical clinical situations, such as hysterectomies for benign tumors (78.8%) and hip replacements due to arthrosis (82.4%). In summary, our study shows that the university hospital admission rates in Germany were substantially reduced following the national COVID-19 lockdown. These included critical care or emergency conditions in which deferral is expected to impair clinical outcomes. Future studies are needed to delineate how appropriate medical care of critically ill patients can be maintained during a pandemic.","Kapsner, Lorenz A; Kampf, Marvin O; Seuchter, Susanne A; Gruendner, Julian; Gulden, Christian; Mate, Sebastian; Mang, Jonathan M; Schüttler, Christina; Deppenwiese, Noemi; Krause, Linda; Zöller, Daniela; Balig, Julien; Fuchs, Timo; Fischer, Patrick; Haverkamp, Christian; Holderried, Martin; Mayer, Gerhard; Stenzhorn, Holger; Stolnicu, Ana; Storck, Michael; Storf, Holger; Zohner, Jochen; Kohlbacher, Oliver; Strzelczyk, Adam; Schüttler, Jürgen; Acker, Till; Boeker, Martin; Kaisers, Udo X; Kestler, Hans A; Prokosch, Hans-Ulrich",Front Public Health,,288

In this work, we study the spread of COVID-19 using a semi-supervised neural network and assuming a passive part of the population remains isolated from the virus dynamics. We start with an unsupervised neural network that learns solutions of differential equations for different modeling parameters and initial conditions. A supervised method then solves the inverse problem by estimating the optimal conditions that generate functions to fit the data for those infected by, recovered from, and deceased due to COVID-19. This semi-supervised approach incorporates real data to determine the evolution of the spread, the passive population, and the basic reproduction number for different countries.","Paticchio, Alessandro; Scarlatti, Tommaso; Mattheakis, Marios; Protopapas, Pavlos; Brambilla, Marco",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.05074v1.pdf,288

The EPA-UNEPSA is strongly convinced that an effective cooperation among European countries is based on the acknowledgement that diversity is a factor of strength, and not of weakness, and that such a factor may create the basis of an effective cooperation in all fields of public interest. Since its foundation in 1975, EPA-UNEPSA has worked to improve child healthcare and to strength the cooperation of children's caretakers in Europe. The studies published in this volume pursue this line of thought, in the belief that contributing to the efforts of creating an effective platform for cooperation and a multidisciplinary approach to common issues in public health may reduce fragmentation of paediatrics and tackle the legal, economic, and organisational challenges of child healthcare in Europe.","Pettoello-Mantovani, Massimo; Pop, Tudor Lucian; Hoey, Hilary",Turk Pediatri Ars,,288

A systematic rapid review was conducted to analyze scientific literature regarding the management, interventions, and strategies adopted to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the pediatric cancer population. Our search on PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, and EMBASE databases yielded 505 articles. After removing duplicates, 21 articles were included. Articles focused on infection prevention (n = 19; 90.5%), management (n = 18; 85.7%), overall management of specific treatments for cancer (n = 13; 61.9%), and education (n = 7; 33.3%). The interventions adopted to prevent the spread of COVID-19 were similar across organizations and in line with general recommendations. Most of them reported interventions that could be used as valid strategies for similar emergencies. The strategies included limiting the risk of contagion by restricting access to the wards and implementing hygiene measures, the identification of separate pathways for the management of patients suspected or confirmed to be infected with COVID-19, the postponement of people accessing the hospital for non-urgent or unnecessary tests or medical examinations, and the preventive screening of patients before chemotherapy treatment or transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells. It is necessary to identify key indicators in order to better evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions implemented over time.

Despite this, many athletes are reluctant to get the COVID-19 vaccine due to concerns that symptoms of vaccinosis may impair athletic performance. OBJECTIVETo determine the effects of COVID-19 vaccination on the physiological responses to graded exercise. METHODSHealthy participants completed a 20-minute bout of graded cycling exercise before and ~21 days after COVID-19 vaccination (2 dose Pfizer mRNA or 1 dose Johnson & Johnson). RESULTSOxygen uptake, CO2 production, respiratory exchange ratio, ventilation, heart rate, serum noradrenaline, and rating of perceived exertion were significantly elevated in the post vaccine trial. However, vaccination did not affect serum lactate, adrenaline, cortisol, predicted [Formula], and ventilatory threshold. Post-vaccine effects on heart rate and noradrenaline remained significant in non-infected participants that received the Pfizer vaccine. No significant effects in respiratory gas exchange parameters were found after vaccination in those previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2, but exercise adrenaline levels were significantly lower and serum lactate levels trending (p= 0.10) lower after vaccination. No changes in any physiological responses to exercise were found in control participants who completed two bouts of exercise separated by ~5 weeks without vaccination. CONCLUSIONRecent COVID-19 vaccination is associated with modest increases in the physiological demands to graded exercise in non-infected healthy people but may actually improve metabolic responses to exercise in those previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Whether or not these small effects could impact athletic performance at the elite level warrants investigation.","Batatinha, Helena Angelica Pereira; Baker, Forrest Lee; Smith, Kyle Andrew; Zuñiga, Tiffany M; Pedlar, Charles R; Burgess, Shane C; Katsanis, Emmanuel; Simpson, Richard J",,,288

We aimed to assess the prevalence and risk of severe COVID-19 and death in people living with HIV (PLWH) on the global and continental level. MethodsElectronic databases were systematically searched in July 2021. Studies were screened and then extracted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Narratives were synthesised and data pooled for global and continental prevalence and relative risk of severity and mortality in HIV-infected COVID-19 patients using random-effect model. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa score, Eggers test and presented as funnel plots. ResultsA total of 46 studies were included involving 18,034,947 COVID-19 cases of which 31,269 were PLWH. The global prevalence of PLWH with SARS-CoV-2 infection was 1% (95% CI = 0.9% -1.1%) with the highest prevalence observed in sub-Saharan Africa. The relative risk (RR) of COVID-19 severity was significant only in Africa (RR, 95% CI = 1.14, 1.08 - 1.24) while risk of COVID-19 mortality was 1.53% (95% CI = 1.45 - 2.03) globally. The prevalence of PLWH in COVID-19 cases was significantly low, and the calculated global risk ratio show that HIV infection may be linked with increased COVID-19 death. The between-studies heterogeneity was significantly high while risk of publication bias was not significant. ConclusionThere is low prevalence of HIV-SARS-CoV-2 co-infection.

It is important to carry out such a survey in hotels. This study aims to determine the levels of knowledge, beliefs, and practices regarding infectious diseases among practitioners and their associations with the environmental quality of hotels in Wuhan, China. We surveyed infectious disease knowledge, beliefs, and practices of practitioners in 18 hotels and detected these hotels' environment, including physical factors of temperature, humidity, noise, and the indoor air quality of benzene, toluene, xylene, formaldehyde, CO, CO2, the total count of fungi, aerobic plate count, PM10, and PM2.5. 128 practitioners were included, and 28.9% were male. The questionnaire included knowledge, beliefs, and practices regarding infectious diseases. Our study found moderate levels of knowledge and beliefs, and good health practices. People's beliefs toward COVID-19 were correlated significantly with their knowledge (p < 0.05). Beliefs and health practices were correlated significantly with environmental quality (p < 0.05). However, the environmental quality was correlated negatively with the classification of hotels. Conclusively, despite the good health practices of practitioners, the knowledge and beliefs toward infectious diseases need to strengthen. Hotels should emphasize health education in practitioners and the improvement of environmental hygiene.

In the present study, some risk factors, including unhealthy nutrition, obesity, and physical inactivity, were assessed in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and their effects on the severity and duration of disease were evaluated. Subject and methods: The present study was a cross-sectional study. Data was collected from all patients who visited the respiratory emergency department from March 20, 2020 to April 24, 2020 in the University Hospital. The outcome measures were body mass index, diet quality that was evaluated with a 16-item food intake questionnaire, and physical activity level that was assessed by the global physical activity questionnaire. Results: Two hundred and six patients' data was analyzed. The results investigated that patients with lower levels of physical activity or lower MET.min/week were affected by a more severe form of the disease (p = 0.05 and p = 0.03, respectively). We found that patients with a healthier dietary pattern were affected by lower severity of illness (p < 0.05). Conclusion: It seems that increasing levels of physical activity may partly reduce the severity of COVID-19 disease. Some dietary patterns such as increasing fruit and poultry consumption as well as drinking less tea were correlated significantly with a less severe form of the disease. The results did not confirm previous concerns regarding a potentially harmful effect of smoking on the severity or duration of symptoms.","Tavakol, Zahra; Ghannadi, Shima; Tabesh, Mastaneh Rajabian; Halabchi, Farzin; Noormohammadpour, Pardis; Akbarpour, Samaneh; Alizadeh, Zahra; Nezhad, Malihe Hassan; Reyhan, Sahar Karimpour",Z Gesundh Wiss,,288

They update their policy in response to the ego agent's behavior, and the ego agent must anticipate these changes to co-adapt. Inspired by humans, we recognize that robots do not need to explicitly model every low-level action another agent will make; instead, we can capture the latent strategy of other agents through high-level representations. We propose a reinforcement learning-based framework for learning latent representations of an agent's policy, where the ego agent identifies the relationship between its behavior and the other agent's future strategy. The ego agent then leverages these latent dynamics to influence the other agent, purposely guiding them towards policies suitable for co-adaptation. Across several simulated domains and a real-world air hockey game, our approach outperforms the alternatives and learns to influence the other agent.","Xie, Annie; Losey, Dylan P.; Tolsma, Ryan; Finn, Chelsea; Sadigh, Dorsa",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.06619v1.pdf,288

The global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has suddenly resurrected a new pillar in oncology care: teleoncology. With oncologists reaching out to patients through telemedicine, it is possible to evaluate and fulfill patients' needs; triage patients for elective procedures; screen them for influenza-like illness; provide them with guidance for hospital visits, if needed; and bridge oral medications and treatments when a hospital visit is not desirable because of any high risk-benefit ratio. Teleoncology can bring great reassurance to patients at times when reaching an oncology center is challenging, and more so in resource-constrained countries. Evidence-based treatment protocols, dispensable by teleoncology, already exist for many sites of cancer and they can provide a bridge to treatment when patients are unable to reach cancer centers for their standard treatment. The young pillar of teleoncology is going to remain much longer than COVID-19.","Pareek, Puneet; Vishnoi, Jeewan Ram; Kombathula, Sri Harsha; Vyas, Rakesh Kumar; Misra, Sanjeev",JCO Glob Oncol,,288

341976,SARS CoV-2 viral load might not be the right predictor of COVID-19 mortality,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this case report is to present the clinical presentation and physical therapist management for a patient with post-COVID syndrome. Secondarily, the report highlights the importance of assessing cognitive and emotional health in patients with post-COVID syndrome. METHODS (CASE DESCRIPTION): A 37-year-old woman tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and developed mild COVID-19 disease but did not require supplemental oxygen or hospitalization. The patient experienced persistent symptoms including dyspnea, headaches, and cognitive fog. On day 62, she participated in an outpatient physical therapist evaluation that revealed deficits in exercise capacity, obtaining 50% of her age-predicted 6-minute walk distance (6MWD). She had minor reductions in muscle strength and cognitive function. Self-reported quality of life (QoL) was 50, and she scored above established cut-off scores for provisional diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). RESULTS: The patient participated in biweekly physical therapist sessions for 8 weeks, which included aerobic training, strengthening exercises, diaphragmatic breathing techniques, and mindfulness training. Metabolic equivalent for task (METS) levels increased with variability over the course of the program. The patient's muscle strength, physical function, and exercise capacity improved. 6MWD increased by 199 m, equating to 80% of her age-predicted distance. QoL and PTSD scores did not improve. At evaluation after physical therapy, the patient was still experiencing migraines, dyspnea, fatigue, and cognitive dysfunction. CONCLUSION: This case report described the clinical presentation and physical therapist management of a person with post-COVID syndrome, a novel health condition for which little evidence exists to guide rehabilitation examination and interventions. Physical therapists should consider cognitive function and emotional health in their plan of care for patients with post-COVID syndromes. IMPACT: This case alerts physical therapists to post-COVID syndrome-which can include debilitating symptoms of decreased aerobic tolerance, anxiety, PTSD, and cognitive dysfunction-and to the role that therapists can play in assessing these symptoms and managing these patients.","Mayer, Kirby P; Steele, Angela K; Soper, Melissa K; Branton, Jill D; Lusby, Megan L; Kalema, Anna G; Dupont-Versteegden, Esther E; Montgomery, Ashley A",Phys. ther,,288
342290,SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with systemic autoimmune diseases,2021,"Macroeconomic indicators, notably unemployment, are significant moderators of suicide. We projected the number of excess suicides in Canada as a consequence of the impact of COVID-19 on unemployment. Annual suicide mortality (2000-2018) and unemployment (2000-2019) data were derived from Statistics Canada. Time-trend regression models were used to evaluate and predict the number of excess suicides in 2020 and 2021 for two possible projection scenarios following the COVID-19 pandemic: 1) an increase in unemployment of 1.6% in 2020, 1.2% in 2021, or 2) an increase in unemployment of 10.7% in 2020, 8.9% in 2021. A percentage point increase in unemployment was associated with a 1.0% increase in suicide between 2000 and 2018. In the first scenario, the rise in unemployment rates resulted in a projected total of 418 excess suicides in 2020-2021 (suicide rate per 100,000: 11.6 in 2020). In the second scenario, the projected suicide rates per 100,000 increased to 14.0 in 2020 and 13.6 in 2021, resulting in 2114 excess suicides in 2020-2021. These results indicate that suicide prevention in the context of COVID-19-related unemployment is a critical priority. Furthermore, timely access to mental healthcare, financial provisions and social/labour support programs, as well as optimal treatment for mental disorders is urgently needed.","McIntyre, Roger S; Lee, Yena",Psychiatry Res,,288
342291,SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with systemic autoimmune diseases,2021,"Resumo: A vigilância de síndrome respiratória aguda grave (SRAG) no Brasil visa a caracterizar a circulação dos vírus Influenza A e B em casos hospitalizados e óbitos, tendo sido ampliada em 2012 para incluir outros vírus respiratórios. A COVID-19 foi detectada no Brasil pela primeira vez na 9ª semana epidemiológica de 2020 e o teste para o vírus SARS-CoV-2 foi incluído no protocolo de vigilância a partir da 12ª semana epidemiológica. O objetivo deste estudo foi investigar o padrão de hospitalizações por SRAG no país após a entrada do SARS-CoV-2, comparando o perfil temporal, etário e de resultados laboratoriais com os anos de 2010 a 2019. Em 2020, a hospitalização por SRAG, contabilizada desde a data do primeiro caso de COVID-19 confirmado até a 12ª semana, superou o observado, no mesmo período, em cada um dos 10 anos anteriores. A faixa etária acima de 60 anos foi a mais acometida, em nível acima do histórico. Houve um aumento considerável de testes laboratoriais negativos, sugerindo a circulação de um vírus diferente dos presentes no painel. Concluímos que o aumento das hospitalizações por SRAG, a falta de informação específica sobre o agente etiológico e a predominância de casos entre idosos, no mesmo período de tempo em que cresce o número de casos novos de COVID-19, é coerente com a hipótese de que os casos graves da doença já estejam sendo detectados pela vigilância de SRAG com sobrecarga para o sistema de saúde. A inclusão da testagem para SARS-CoV-2 no protocolo de vigilância de SRAG e sua efetiva implementação são de grande importância para acompanhar a evolução dos casos graves da doença no país.","Bastos, Leonardo Soares; Niquini, Roberta Pereira; Lana, Raquel Martins; Villela, Daniel A.

However, whether early radiographic change is a predictor of fatality remains unknown. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed records of all laboratory-confirmed patients admitted to a quarantine unit at Tongji Hospital, a large regional hospital in Wuhan, China, between January 31 and March 5, 2020. Confirmed cases were defined by positive RT-PCR detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in throat-swab specimens. Chest CT images were reviewed independently by two radiologists. The Tongji Hospital ethics committee approved this study. RESULTS: A total of 102 patients were confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection. As of March 25, 85 confirmed patients were discharged, 15 died, and 2 remained hospitalized. When compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (median age, 69 [interquartile range, 58-77] vs. 55 [44-66], p = 0.003), and more likely to have decreased lymphocyte count (0.5 vs. 0.9 × 109/L, p = 0.006), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (569.0 vs. 272.0 U/L, p < 0.001), elevated d-dimer (> 1 µg/mL, 86% vs. 37%, p = 0.002) on admission. Older age and elevated LDH were independent risk factors for fatality in a multivariate regression model included the above variables. In a subset of patients with CT images within the first week, higher total severity score, and more involved lung lobes (5 involved lobes) in CT images within the first week were significantly associated with fatality. Moreover, in this subset of patients, higher total severity score was the only independent risk factor in a multivariate analysis incorporating the above mentioned variables. CONCLUSIONS: Older age, elevated LDH on admission, and higher severity score of CT images within the first week are potential predictors of fatality in adults with COVID-19. These predictors may help clinicians identify patients with a poor prognosis at an early stage.","Li, Kaiyan; Chen, Dian; Chen, Shengchong; Feng, Yuchen; Chang, Chenli; Wang, Zi; Wang, Nan; Zhen, Guohua",Respir Res,,288

345819,SARS-CoV-2 in peritoneal swabs from asymptomatic patients undergoing emergency abdominal surgery,2021,"A key characteristic of the spread of infectious diseases is their ability to use efficient transmission paths within contact graphs. This enables the pathogen to maximise infection rates and spread within a target population. In this work, we devise techniques to localise infections and decrease infection rates based on a principled analysis of disease transmission paths within human-contact networks (proximity graphs). Experimental results of disease spreading shows that that at low visibility rates contact tracing slows disease spreading. However to stop disease spreading, contact tracing requires both significant visibility (at least 60%) into the proximity graph and the ability to place half of the population under isolation. We find that pro-actively isolating super-links -- key proximity encounters -- has significant benefits: targeted isolation of a fourth of the population based on 35% visibility into the proximity graph prevents an epidemic outbreak. It turns out that isolating super-spreaders is more effective than contact tracing and testing but less effective than targeting super-links. We highlight the important role of topology in epidemic outbreaks. We argue that proactive innoculation of a population by disabling super-links and super-spreaders may have an important complimentary role alongside contact tracing and testing as part of a sophisticated public-health response to epidemic outbreaks.","Nagaraja, Shishir",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02241v2.pdf,288

In the present study, we examine the nature of videoconference fatigue, when this phenomenon occurs, and what videoconference characteristics are associated with fatigue using a mixed-methods approach.

COVID-19 positive individuals may even be asymptomatic making the diagnosis difficult, but amongst the infected subjects, the asymptomatic ones need not be entirely free of symptoms caused by the virus. They might not show any observable symptoms like the symptomatic subjects, but they may differ from uninfected ones in the way they cough. These differences in the coughing sounds are minute and indiscernible to the human ear, however, these can be captured using machine learning-based statistical models. In this paper, we present a deep learning approach to analyze the acoustic dataset provided in Track 1 of the DiCOVA 2021 Challenge containing cough sound recordings belonging to both COVID-19 positive and negative examples. To perform the classification on the sound recordings as belonging to a COVID-19 positive or negative examples, we propose a ConvNet model. Our model achieved an AUC score percentage of 72.23 on the blind test set provided by the same for an unbiased evaluation of the models. The ConvNet model incorporated with Data Augmentation further increased the AUC-ROC percentage from 72.23 to 87.07. It also outperformed the DiCOVA 2021 Challenge's baseline model by 23% thus, claiming the top position on the DiCOVA 2021 Challenge leaderboard.

The paper used a structured case study approach to analyse the impacts and responses and relied heavily on existing reports and data sources in each country. The pandemic has further revealed the vulnerability of small-scale fishing households in the region. Given the few assets of fisher households, their ability to cushion the negative impact of crises and shocks is limited. Fishers made adaptive responses such as direct fish marketing, online marketing, and home delivery services. While short-term responses of providing food and financial assistance have been helpful, long-term support to address pandemics such as COVID-19 and other stressors will require developing more resilient fishing households. The paper recommends several approaches and interventions to improve household resilience and to be better prepared for similar challenges and threats in the future. These include: i) strengthening the fishing households’ social network of friends, relatives, and neighbours to serve as both a social safety net and a bridge towards the transition to financial inclusion;ii) diversifying livelihood to reduce dependency on the fishery and provide for additional sources of income and food;iii) promoting financial inclusion through savings, credit, digital payment products, and insurance;iv) value chain upgrading through post-harvest fish handling and processing methods;and, v) providing access, especially for women, to social protection measures such as government health insurance and social security. © Asian Fisheries Society.","Ferrer, A.

To explore the impacts of the input population and quarantine strategies on the disease variations at different scenarios, four time points were assumed as Feb 6, Feb 16, Feb 24 and Mar 5 2020. The major results suggest that our model can well capture the disease variations with high accuracy. The simulated peak value of the confirmed cases is 1002 at Feb 10, 2020 which is mostly close to the reported number of 1007 at Feb 9, 2020. The disease will become extinction with peak value of 1397 at May 11, 2020. Moreover, the increased numbers of the input population can mainly shorten the disease extinction days and the increased percentages of the exposed individuals of the input population increase the number of cumulative confirmed cases at a small percentage. Increasing the input population and decreasing the quarantine strategy together around the time point of the peak value of the confirmed cases, may lead to the second outbreak.","Hu, Zengyun; Cui, Qianqian; Han, Junmei; Wang, Xia; Sha, Wei E I; Teng, Zhidong",Int J Infect Dis,,288

351524,Persistent clinical features in paediatric patients after SARS-CoV-2 virological recovery: A retrospective population-based cohort study from a single centre in Latvia,2020,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the differences in outcome arising from the use of semi-compliant (SCB) versus non-compliant balloon (NCB) systems for predilatation during self-expanding transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). METHODS: 251 TAVR procedures with the implantation of self-expanding valves after predilatation were analyzed. SCB systems were used in 166 and NCB systems in 85 patients. The primary endpoint was defined as device success, a composite endpoint comprising the absence of procedural mortality, correct valve positioning, adequate valve performance and the absence of more than a mild paravalvular leak. The secondary endpoints were chosen in accordance with the valve academic research consortium (VARC-2) endpoint definitions. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed with regard to procedural device success between the SCB- and NCB cohort (SCB: 142 [85.5%%] vs. NCB: 77 [90.6%]; P = .257). There was a notable difference between the rates of conversion to open surgery and the postdilatation rate, both of which were higher for the NCB group (SCB: 1 [0.6%] vs. NCB: 4 [5.1%]; P = .042; SCB: 30 [18.1%] vs. NCB: 34 [40%]; P < .001). In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, the use of semi-compliant balloon systems for predilatation was associated with a lower risk for postdilatation (OR: 0.296; 95% CI: 0.149-0.588) and conversion to open surgery (OR: 0.205; 95% CI: 0.085-0.493; P = .001) but not for device success. CONCLUSION: While the balloon compliance did not affect the procedural mortality, device success or the rate of paravalvular leakage, the use of semi-compliant balloons for predilatation during TAVR should be investigated in larger randomized trials in the light of the lower rates of postdilatation and conversion to open surgery compared to their non-compliant counterparts.","Mach, Markus; Szalkiewicz, Philipp; Poschner, Thomas; Hasan, Waseem; Andreas, Martin; Winkler, Bernhard; Hasimbegovic, Ena; Steinkellner, Theresia; Strouhal, Andreas; Adlbrecht, Christopher; Delle-Karth, Georg; Grabenwöger, Martin",Eur J Clin Invest,,288

351692,Inhibitoren des Renin-Angiotensin-Systems und SARS-CoV-2-Infektion./ Inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system and SARS-CoV-2 infection,2020,"Participatory planning traditionally requires face-to-face meetings with the public in community fora, design charrettes, planning commission meetings, and so on. However, because of the COVID-19 pandemic and aided by online participatory technologies, planners have been translating their face-to-face practices for use in digital forums. These new tools are equipping planners with greater ability to control meeting interactions, including the ability to stifle dissent. In this Viewpoint, we argue that planners should devise the means to protect modes of digital dissent if they want to avoid propagating the injustices of physical participatory processes in the digital world. Based on ongoing research, we offer guidance to planners about how to begin discussing the meaningful roles dissent could play and how it might effectively and fairly be incorporated into virtual participatory planning processes. In practice, this means that planners must pay more explicit attention to the norms and rules of participation as they evolve for online settings and to avoid hasty judgments when confronted with dissenting voices.

352100,Presentation of SARS-CoV-2 in a Pediatric Heart Transplant Recipient with Multiple Underlying Comorbidities,2021,"Patients with COVID-19 are at high risk for thrombotic arterial and venous occlusions. Lung histopathology often reveals fibrin-based blockages in the small blood vessels of patients who succumb to the disease. Antiphospholipid syndrome is an acquired and potentially life-threatening thrombophilia in which patients develop pathogenic autoantibodies targeting phospholipids and phospholipid-binding proteins (aPL antibodies). Case series have recently detected aPL antibodies in patients with COVID-19. Here, we measured eight types of aPL antibodies in serum samples from 172 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. These aPL antibodies included anticardiolipin IgG, IgM, and IgA; anti-ß2 glycoprotein I IgG, IgM, and IgA; and anti-phosphatidylserine/prothrombin (aPS/PT) IgG and IgM. We detected aPS/PT IgG in 24% of serum samples, anticardiolipin IgM in 23% of samples, and aPS/PT IgM in 18% of samples. Antiphospholipid autoantibodies were present in 52% of serum samples using the manufacturer's threshold and in 30% using a more stringent cutoff (&#8805;40 ELISA-specific units). Higher titers of aPL antibodies were associated with neutrophil hyperactivity, including the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), higher platelet counts, more severe respiratory disease, and lower clinical estimated glomerular filtration rate. Similar to IgG from patients with antiphospholipid syndrome, IgG fractions isolated from patients with COVID-19 promoted NET release from neutrophils isolated from healthy individuals. Furthermore, injection of IgG purified from COVID-19 patient serum into mice accelerated venous thrombosis in two mouse models. These findings suggest that half of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 become at least transiently positive for aPL antibodies and that these autoantibodies are potentially pathogenic.","Zuo, Yu; Estes, Shanea K; Ali, Ramadan A; Gandhi, Alex A; Yalavarthi, Srilakshmi; Shi, Hui; Sule, Gautam; Gockman, Kelsey; Madison, Jacqueline A; Zuo, Melanie; Yadav, Vinita; Wang, Jintao; Woodard, Wrenn; Lezak, Sean P; Lugogo, Njira L; Smith, Stephanie A; Morrissey, James H; Kanthi, Yogendra; Knight, Jason S",Sci. transl. med,,288
353601,SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia Patients Suggests Less Clinical Impact Than in the General Population,2021,"The objective of this review is to explore and discuss the concept of local food system resilience in light of the disruptions brought to those systems by the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. The discussion, which focuses on low and middle income countries, considers also the other shocks and stressors that generally affect local food systems and their actors in those countries (weather-related, economic, political or social disturbances). The review of existing (mainly grey or media-based) accounts on COVID-19 suggests that, with the exception of those who lost members of their family to the virus, as per June 2020 the main impact of the pandemic derives mainly from the lockdown and mobility restrictions imposed by national/local governments, and the consequence that the subsequent loss of income and purchasing power has on people's food security, in particular the poor. The paper then uses the most prominent advances made recently in the literature on household resilience in the context of food security and humanitarian crises to identify a series of lessons that can be used to improve our understanding of food system resilience and its link to food security in the context of the COVID-19 crisis and other shocks. Those lessons include principles about the measurement of food system resilience and suggestions about the types of interventions that could potentially strengthen the abilities of actors (including policy makers) to respond more appropriately to adverse events affecting food systems in the future.","Béné, Christophe",Food Secur,,288
353602,SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia Patients Suggests Less Clinical Impact Than in the General Population,2021,"The new coronavirus known as COVID-19 is rapidly spreading since December 2019. Without any vaccination or medicine, the means of controlling it are limited to quarantine and social distancing. Here we study the spatio-temporal propagation of the COVID-19 virus in China and compare it to other global locations. Our results suggest that the disease propagation is highly related to population migration from Hubei resembling a L\'{e}vy flight which is characteristic of human mobility. Our results also suggest that the disease spread in a city in China is characterized by two-stages process. At early times, at order of few days, the infection rate in the city is almost constant probably due to the lack of means to detect infected individuals before infection signs are observed and at later times it decays approximately exponentially due to quarantines. These two stages can explain the significant differences between the propagation in China and in other world-wide locations. While most Chinese cities control the disease which resulted in the decaying stage, in other world-wide countries the situation is still becoming worse probably due to less control.","Gross, Bnaya; Zheng, Zhiguo; Liu, Shiyan; Chen, Xiaoqi; Sela, Alon; Li, Jianxin; Li, Daqing; Havlin, Shlomo",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.08382v1.pdf,288

COVID-19's fast-paced global spread with a broad range of clinical manifestations compelled health regulatory organizations, public health professionals, and researchers to update their information about the disease and provide individual- and community-based guidelines, solutions, and regulations to break the disease cycle, mitigate person-to-person transmission, and reduce cross-contamination in healthcare settings. In this review, the authors provide known facts and updated information about SARS-CoV-2 virology and its new variants, transmission routes, reported clinical symptoms, epidemiology, and infection control and prevention guidelines with a focus on a hierarchy of controls in dental settings.","Banava, S.; Gansky, S.

354589,Clinical risk profile associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and complications in the emergency area of a pediatric COVID-19 center,2020,"Communities of color in the United States have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Studies exploring the mental health implications of these disparities have only just begun to emerge. The purpose of this study is to better understand mental health concerns and test whether social determinants of health and COVID-19-related experiences influence these concerns. In April 2020, we launched a community-based survey for adults across the United States. A total of 341 respondents completed the survey, which included questions about demographics, depression, social isolation, work environment, and preexisting mental health conditions. We generated matched controls by adding county data from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to our survey. Chi square, Pearson product-moment correlation, point biserial correlation, and logistic regression were estimated. Our analysis revealed that respondents who identified as Latinx, Latin@, or Hispanic were 10 times more likely to meet the threshold score for depression. Similarly, individuals with prior mental health conditions and those who expressed feelings of social isolation due to COVID-19 were 3 times more likely to meet the threshold score for depression. These results confirm our hypothesis that communities of color will likely experience disproportionate mental health impacts of COVID-19-specifically, the mental health sequela that emerge from exposure, cumulative burden, and social isolation. We discuss the implications for expanding access and quality of health and mental health services to address current inequities.","Saltzman, Leia Y; Lesen, Amy E; Henry, Veronica; Hansel, Tonya C; Bordnick, Patrick S",Health Secur,,288

However, its role in acute lung injury has not been elucidated. Acute lung injury is associated with disruption of the alveolo-capillary barrier leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Mechanical ventilation may be necessary to support gas exchange in patients with ARDS, however, high positive airway pressures can cause regional overdistension of alveolar units and aggravate lung injury. Here, we report that acute lung injury and alveolar overstretching activate the p53/p21 pathway to maintain homeostasis and avoid massive cell apoptosis. A systematic pooling of transcriptomic data from animal models of lung injury demonstrates the enrichment of specific p53- and p21-dependent gene signatures and a validated senescence profile. In a clinically relevant, murine model of acid aspiration and mechanical ventilation, we observed changes in the nuclear envelope and the underlying chromatin, DNA damage and activation of the Tp53/p21 pathway. Absence of Cdkn1a decreased the senescent response, but worsened lung injury due to increased cell apoptosis. Conversely, treatment with lopinavir and/or ritonavir led to Cdkn1a overexpression and ameliorated cell apoptosis and lung injury. The activation of these mechanisms was associated with early markers of senescence, including expression of senescence-related genes and increases in senescence-associated heterochromatin foci in alveolar cells. Autopsy samples from lungs of patients with ARDS revealed increased senescence-associated heterochromatin foci. Collectively, these results suggest that acute lung injury activates p53/p21 as an antiapoptotic mechanism to ameliorate damage, but with the side effect of induction of senescence.","Blázquez-Prieto, Jorge; Huidobro, Covadonga; López-Alonso, Inés; Amado-Rodriguez, Laura; Martín-Vicente, Paula; López-Martínez, Cecilia; Crespo, Irene; Pantoja, Cristina; Fernandez-Marcos, Pablo J; Serrano, Manuel; Sznajder, Jacob I; Albaiceta, Guillermo M",Transl. res,,288
356936,"Andrographolide, a diterpenoid lactone compound of andrographis paniculata, binds to lys353 and asp38 in the peptidase domain of human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2",2021,"BACKGROUND: Overcoming the COVID-19 crisis requires new ideas and strategies for online communication of personal medical information and patient empowerment. Rapid testing of a large number of subjects is essential for monitoring and delaying the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in order to mitigate the pandemic's consequences. People who do not know that they are infected may not stay in quarantine and, thus, risk infecting others. Unfortunately, the massive number of COVID-19 tests performed is challenging for both laboratories and the units that conduct throat swabs and communicate the results. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to reduce the communication burden for health care professionals. We developed a secure and easy-to-use tracking system to report COVID-19 test results online that is simple to understand for the tested subjects as soon as these results become available. Instead of personal calls, the system updates the status and the results of the tests automatically. This aims to reduce the delay when informing testees about their results and, consequently, to slow down the virus spread. METHODS: The application in this study draws on an existing tracking tool. With this open-source and browser-based online tracking system, we aim to minimize the time required to inform the tested person and the testing units (eg, hospitals or the public health care system). The system can be integrated into the clinical workflow with very modest effort and avoids excessive load to telephone hotlines. RESULTS: The test statuses and results are published on a secured webpage, enabling regular status checks by patients; status checks are performed without the use of smartphones, which has some importance, as smartphone usage diminishes with age. Stress tests and statistics show the performance of our software. CTest is currently running at two university hospitals in Germany-University Hospital Ulm and University Hospital Tübingen-with thousands of tests being performed each week. Results show a mean number of 10 (SD 2.8) views per testee. CONCLUSIONS: CTest runs independently of existing infrastructures, aims at straightforward integration, and aims for the safe transmission of information. The system is easy to use for testees. QR (Quick Response) code links allow for quick access to the test results. The mean number of views per entry indicates a reduced amount of time for both health care professionals and testees. The system is quite generic and can be extended and adapted to other communication tasks.","Völkel, Gunnar; Fürstberger, Axel; Schwab, Julian D; Werle, Silke D; Ikonomi, Nensi; Gscheidmeier, Thomas; Kraus, Johann M; Groß, Alexander; Holderried, Martin; Balig, Julien; Jobst, Franz; Kuhn, Peter; Kuhn, Klaus A; Kohlbacher, Oliver; Kaisers, Udo X; Seufferlein, Thomas; Kestler, Hans A",J Med Internet Res,,288

Reconfiguration of services during the pandemic may negatively affect medical and obstetric care. We aimed to examine the impacts on IBD antenatal care and pregnancy outcomes. METHODS: Retrospective data were recorded in consecutive patients attending for IBD antenatal care including outpatient appointments, infusion unit visits and advice line encounters. RESULTS: We included 244 pregnant women with IBD, of which 75 (30.7%) were on biologics in whom the treatment was stopped in 29.3% at a median 28 weeks gestation. In addition, 9% of patients were on corticosteroids and 21.5% continued on thiopurines. The care provided during 460 patient encounters was not affected by the pandemic in 94.1% but 68.2% were performed via telephone (compared with 3% prepandemic practice; p<0.0001). One-hundred-ten women delivered 111 alive babies (mean 38.2 weeks gestation, mean birth weight 3324 g) with 12 (11.0%) giving birth before week 37. Birth occurred by vaginal delivery in 72 (56.4%) and by caesarean section in 48 (43.6%) cases. Thirty-three were elective (12 for IBD indications) and 15 emergency caesarean sections. Breast feeding rates were low (38.6%). Among 244 pregnant women with IBD, 1 suspected COVID-19 infection was recorded. CONCLUSION: IBD antenatal care adjustments during the COVID-19 pandemic have not negatively affected patient care. Despite high levels of immunosuppression, only a single COVID-19 infection occurred. Adverse pregnancy outcomes were infrequent.","Selinger, Christian Philipp; Fraser, Aileen; Collins, Paul; Gunn, Melanie; Chew, Thean Soon; Kerry, Georgina; Patel, Kamal V; Roysam, Maya; Bel Kok, Klaartje; Bancil, Aaron; Hall, Veronica; Cooney, Rachel; Smith, Lyn; Steed, Helen; Segal, Jonathan; Kent, Alexandra; Limdi, Jimmy; Sebastian, Shaji",,,288

The latter extends to the current labeling of COVID-19 as the ""Chinese virus,"" that-along with a number of other terms-has fueled race-based stigma against Asian groups in the United States and overseas. This review further discusses the limitations of current COVID-19 antistigma initiatives that mostly focus on individual-based education campaigns as opposed to multisectorial programs informed by human rights and intersectional perspectives.Finally, the article ends with a call to the international public health community toward addressing the most recent outbreak of stigma, one that has revealed the enormous impact of words in amplifying racial bias against particular minority populations in the developed world.","Viladrich, Anahí",Am J Public Health,,288

We look for the conditions to avoid a second epidemic peak in the phase of release from confinement. We derive equations for the critical levels of mask efficiency, mask adoption (fraction of population wearing masks) and fraction of population engaging in physical distancing that lower the basic reproduction number â 0 to unity. Conclusions: For â 0 = 2.5, if at least 40% of people wear masks with efficiency 50%, and at least 20% of the population without masks (or anti-maskers) respect physical distancing measures, the effective reproduction number can be reduced to less than 1 and COVID-19 infections would plummet. The model predicts also that if at least half of the people respecting physical distancing, COVID-19 outbreaks with â 0 of about 3, would be theoretically extinguished without wearing masks.

Among adults, it represents a spectrum of neoplasms with reserved prognosis. There is no consensus on the treatment of choice of these lesions, justifying a systematic review of the literature on treatment options, prognostic factors, and survival. MATERIAL/METHODS: a systematic review of articles published in Pubmed, Medline, LiLacs e SciElo, from 1966 to March/2019, presenting the keywords: primary-liver-sarcoma and primary-hepatic-sarcoma was undertaken. Studies including patients older than 18 years, and published in English, Portuguese and Spanish were included. Case reports, metastatic tumors and multiple oncologic diagnosis were excluded. The initial search listed 1,318 articles. 1,206 did not meet the inclusion criteria. After reviewing 112 eligible articles, 15 were selected (14 case series and 1 retrospective-cohort). RESULTS: proposed treatment modalities for primary liver sarcoma included surgery and/or chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy or liver transplantation. The most common histological types were angiosarcoma (32%), leiomyosarcoma (29%), epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (15%) and embryonal sarcoma (7%). Histology, degree of differentiation and R0 resection were mentioned positive prognostic factors. Median survival ranged from two to 23 months. Five-year survival rate varied from 0% to 64%, on average 21%. CONCLUSION: surgical resection (R0 resection) is the main treatment for primary liver sarcomas. Development of effective systemic therapies are required to improve prognosis of patients harboring this type of tumor.","Martins, Antonio Cavalcanti DE Albuquerque; Costa Neto, DuÍlio Cabral DA; Silva, JÚlio Dourado DE-Matos E; Moraes, Ygor Monteiro; LeÃo, Cristiano Souza; Martins, Carolina",Rev Col Bras Cir,,288

We studied the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 on a group and individual level in intubated ICU patients. METHODS: In a cohort of 86 patients, we analysed SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results on nasopharyngeal and sputum samples (obtained as part of clinical care twice a week) according to time after intubation. Subsequently, we performed survival analyses. RESULTS: 870 samples were tested by RT-PCR. Overall viral load was highest in the first week (median nasopharynx 3.5, IQR 1.5-4.3; median sputum 4.3, IQR 3.3-5.6) and decreased over time. In 20% of patients a relapsing pattern was observed. Nasopharyngeal and sputum PCR status on day 14 was not significantly associated with survival up to day 60 in this small cohort. CONCLUSION: In general SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels in respiratory samples in patients with severe COVID-19 decrease after the first week after intubation, but individual SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels can show a relapsing pattern. Larger studies are needed to address the association of clearance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from respiratory samples with survival, because we observed a trend towards better survival in patients with early clearance from sputum.","Boef, Anna G C; van Wezel, Esther M; Gard, Lilli; Netkova, Kala; Lokate, Mariëtte; van der Voort, Peter H J; Niesters, Hubert G M; Van Leer Buter, Coretta",J Crit Care,,288

382577,"Association of SARS-CoV-2 clades with clinical, inflammatory and virologic outcomes: An observational study",2021,"RATIONALE: The COVID-19 pandemic is spreading around the world and the leading cause of death is rapidly progressive respiratory failure because of lung damage and consolidation. Lung transplantation is the last line of treatment for chronic end-stage lung diseases. There were several cases of lung transplantation reported in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. However, anesthetic management of lung transplantation in this subpopulation is rare. We report the anesthetic and perioperative management of lung transplantation in a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 70-year-old man with a 7-day history of fever was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia. His throat swab was positive for COVID-19, but negative for other common viruses. Chest radiography showed multiple inflammatory foci in both lungs. By day 5, he presented respiratory distress. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed progressive deterioration of both lungs. Starting on day 7, SARS-CoV-2 RNA in bronchoalveolar lavage samples were continuously negative. However, his lung condition deteriorated. By day 17, a veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was initiated. After 10âdays of ECMO support, the patient's lung condition did not improve. CT scan revealed bilateral parenchymal consolidation with pulmonary fibrosis and hydrothorax. DIAGNOSIS: Irreversible lung function loss induced by COVID-19 pneumonia. INTERVENTIONS: Bilateral transplantation was performed because the patient's lung condition did not improve and CT scan revealed parenchymal consolidation with pulmonary fibrosis after 10âdays of ECMO support. Thirty-six hours after the surgery, ECMO was discontinued. A percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and a stent implantation were performed because of acute coronary syndrome and myocardial ischemia 4âdays postoperatively. OUTCOMES: The patient remained hospitalized because of requirements for intermittent assisted ventilation via tracheostomy. LESSONS: This case further supports the consideration that lung transplantation can potentially be the successful therapy for these patients who have developed irreversible lung function lose due to COVID-19 pneumonia. However, most critical patients with COVID-19 are older individuals with various comorbidities, which present new anesthetic challenges.","Guo, Shao-Hui; Li, Ang; Yin, Peng-Fei; Zhu, Sheng-Mei; Yao, Yong-Xing",Medicine (Baltimore),,288

METHODS: A total of 17 patients with diffuse nonaneurysmal SAH were included in this retrospective study. We characterized demographics and HR-VWI findings and reviewed the clinical management and outcomes. RESULTS: Of the patients 14 (14/17; 82.4%,) showed abnormal findings on HR-VWI, including 5 with intracranial dissections (29.4%), 3 with blood blister-like aneurysm (17.6%), 1 with ruptured fusiform aneurysm (5.9%), and 5 with focal nodular wall enhancement without unclassified pathology (29.4%). Of these patients were treated with endovascular management. Most patients (16/17) had a favorable modified Rankin scale scores of 0-2 on discharge. CONCLUSION: The 3D HR-VWI revealed various hidden pathologies, such as intracranial arterial dissection, blood blister-like aneurysm, and fusiform aneurysm in patients with diffuse nonaneurysmal SAH. In addition, 3D HR-VWI had an impact on the management of SAH.

Here, we investigated the influence of treatments for osteoporosis and other non-inflammatory rheumatic conditions, such as osteoarthritis and fibromyalgia, on COVID-19 incidence. To this end, we conducted a cross-sectional study of 2,102 patients being treated at the Rheumatology Service of Hospital del Mar (Barcelona, Spain). In our cohort, COVID-19 cumulative incidence from March 1 to May 3, 2020 was compared to population estimates for the same city. We used Poisson regression models to determine the adjusted relative risk ratios for COVID-19 associated with different treatments and comorbidities. Denosumab, zoledronate and calcium were negatively associated with COVID-19 incidence. Some analgesics, particularly pregabalin and most of the studied antidepressants, were positively associated with COVID-19 incidence, whereas duloxetine presented a negative association. Oral bisphosphonates, vitamin D, thiazide diuretics, anti-hypertensive drugs and chronic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs had no effect on COVID-19 incidence in the studied population. Our results provide novel evidence to support the maintenance of the main anti-osteoporosis treatments in COVID-19 patients, which may be of particular relevance to elderly patients affected by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Blanch-Rubió, Josep; Soldevila-Domenech, Natalia; Tío, Laura; Llorente-Onaindia, Jone; Ciria-Recasens, Manuel; Polino, Luciano; Gurt, Alba; de la Torre, Rafael; Maldonado, Rafael; Monfort, Jordi; Group, The Covidmar Study",Aging (Albany NY),,288

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) and epicardial fat (EAT) have shown to outperform traditional risk factors in predicting cardiovascular events in the general population. We aim to determine if CAC and EAT determined by Computed Tomographic (CT) scanning can predict all-cause mortality in patients admitted with COVID-19 disease. We performed a retrospective, post-hoc analysis of all patients admitted to Montefiore Medical Center with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis from March 1st, 2020 to May 2nd, 2020 who had a non-contrast CT of the chest within 5 years prior to admission. We determined ordinal CAC scores and quantified the epicardial (EAT) and thoracic (TAT) fat volume and examined their relationship with inpatient mortality. A total of 493 patients were analyzed. There were 197 deaths (39.95%). Patients who died during the index admission had higher age (72, [64-80] vs 68, [57-76]; p < 0.001), CAC score (3, [0-6] vs 1, [0-4]; p < 0.001) and EAT (107, [70-152] vs 94, [64-129]; p = 0.023). On a competing risk analysis regression model, CAC &#8805; 4 and EAT &#8805; median (98 ml) were independent predictors of mortality with increased mortality of 63% (p = 0.003) and 43% (p = 0.032), respectively. As a composite, the group with a combination of CAC &#8805; 4 and EAT &#8805; 98 ml had the highest mortality. CAC and EAT measured from chest CT are strong independent predictors of inpatient mortality from COVID-19 in this high-risk cohort.","Slipczuk, Leandro; Castagna, Francesco; Schonberger, Alison; Novogrodsky, Eitan; Sekerak, Richard; Dey, Damini; Jorde, Ulrich P; Levsky, Jeffrey M; Garcia, Mario J",Int. j. cardiovasc. imaging,,288

Neste contexto os quadros de rinite têm apresentado uma contribuição significativa. O presente estudo propõe a determinação dos perfis de eliminação de agentes envolvidos em rinite nos suínos avaliando diferentes faixas etárias em nove propriedades de ciclo completo com histórico de lesão em cornetos e que utilizem diferentes formas de prevenção e controle destas manifestações. Foram avaliados suabes de tonsilas de 12 animais, nas seguintes faixas etárias: matrizes, leitões de 20, 40 e 60 dias, suínos de 90, 110 e 140 dias, totalizando 84 animais por propriedade e 756 amostras em todo o estudo. As amostras foram submetidas à pesquisa de P. multocida tipo capsular A e D, gene codificador de toxina dermonecrótica de P. multocida, B. bronchiseptica e cytomegalovirus suíno através da reação em cadeia pela polimerase (PCR). Apesar do histórico de lesões em corneto em todas as propriedades apenas um animal foi positivo para presença de P. multocida tipo A e todos foram negativos para a presença do gene codificador da toxina dermonecrótica. Dentre os 756 animais 22 (2,9%) foram positivos para presença de B. bronchiseptica e 198 (26,1%) para detecção cytomegalovirus suíno. A presença B. bronchiseptica apresentou associação estatisticamente significativa com as fases de maternidade e terminação. A maior freqüência de cytomegalovirus suíno apresentou associação estatisticamente significativa com a fase de creche. Observaram-se matrizes eliminando B. bronchiseptica nos três tipos de granjas avaliadas, indicando que a fêmeas tem participação ativa na infecção dos leitões pelo agente.

We aimed to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on racial/ethnic groups in the United States (US) and to assess the effects of social distancing, social vulnerability metrics, and medical disparities. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted utilizing data from the COVID-19 Tracking Project and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Demographic data were obtained from the US Census Bureau, social vulnerability data were obtained from the CDC, social distancing data were obtained from Unacast, and medical disparities data from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services. A comparison of proportions by Fisher's exact test was used to evaluate differences between death rates stratified by age. Negative binomial regression analysis was used to predict COVID-19 deaths based on social distancing scores, social vulnerability metrics, and medical disparities. RESULTS: COVID-19 cumulative infection and death rates were higher among minority racial/ethnic groups than whites across many states. Older age was also associated with increased cumulative death rates across all racial/ethnic groups on a national level, and many minority racial/ethnic groups experienced significantly greater cumulative death rates than whites within age groups &#8805; 35 years. All studied racial/ethnic groups experienced higher hospitalization rates than whites. Older persons (&#8805; 65 years) also experienced more COVID-19 deaths associated with comorbidities than younger individuals. Social distancing factors, several measures of social vulnerability, and select medical disparities were identified as being predictive of county-level COVID-19 deaths.

Social media can not only deliver reliable information to the public but can in turn reflect changes in the public's psychological status. Insight into the public's hotspots of concern and mental status through media background tools contributes to the formulation of public health policies and the clarification of epidemic development mode. METHODS: WeChat is the largest social media in China. Taking the recovery period of COVID-19 in China, for example, we collected WeChat Index data and analyzed the public's concern about the course of COVID-19 and the restoration of emotional tendency through keywords search. RESULTS: With the gradual control of the COVID-19 in China, the public psychological status changes from negative to neutral, accompanied by a weakening of negative emotions and an increase in positive emotions. Every obvious inflection point of improvement in social operation is reflected in the increase of public attention and the relaxation of lifestyle. CONCLUSIONS: Social media can be used to monitor the public psychological status and the development mode and trend of infection in one country during a pandemic.","Jia, Fei; Liu, Xiaoguang",J. public health (Oxf),,288

However, few studies have investigated telemedicine from the perspective of the patient experience. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate patient satisfaction scores of telemedicine outpatient clinic visits in neurosurgery in comparison with in-person visits. METHODS: After obtaining Institutional Review Board approval, Press Ganey surveys from 3/1/2019 to 9/15/2020 were evaluated retrospectively from single-institution, academic neurosurgical clinics. Due to the non-normality of our data, stratified Wilcoxon tests were performed with correction for care provider differences. Domain score probability values were corrected for multiple comparisons. Average scores (range 20-100) are documented as mean ± standard deviation. RESULTS: The response rates were 20% (97 responders) for telemedicine visits and 19% (589 responders) for in-person visits. Patient overall satisfaction score was slightly higher with telemedicine visits compared to in-person corrected for care provider differences (94.2 ± 12.2 vs 93.1 ± 13.4, p = 0.085). The care provider domain demonstrated no statistically significant difference in telemedicine compared to in-person (94.7 ± 14.4 vs 92.4 ± 16.5, p = 0.096). The access domain (93.7 ± 12.3 vs 93.4 ± 12.4, p = 0.999) and overall domains (94.1 ± 12.1 vs 94.4 ± 13.4, p = 1.000) were not found to be different between visit types. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine appears to be a valuable option for neurosurgical patients and is not significantly different to in-person visits in all domains. This study demonstrates that telemedicine visits result in comparable satisfaction scores by neurosurgical patients, and providers should continue offering this option to their patients as we approach the post-COVID era.","Porche, Ken; Vaziri, Sasha; Mehkri, Yusuf; Christie, Carlton; Laurent, Dimitri; Wang, Yu; Rahman, Maryam",Clin Neurol Neurosurg,,288

Pneumothorax/pneumomediastinum in COVID-19 patients seem to be more common and have different clinical characteristics. Here we report 9 patients who had pneumothorax and/or pneumomediastinum during their stay in the ICU. Patients who were admitted to ICU between March 2020 and December 2020, were reviewed for presence of pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema during their ICU stay. Demographic characteristics, mechanical ventilation settings, documented ventilation parameters, outcomes were studied. A total of 161 patients were admitted to ICU during the study period, 96 were invasively ventilated. Nine patients had developed pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum and/or subcutaneous emphysema during their admission. Five of them were men and median age was 66.6 years. All patients were intubated and mechanically ventilated. All patients were managed conservatively. One patient was discharged from ICU, the others were lost due to other complications related to COVID-19. Upon detection of pneumothorax and/or mediastinum all patients were managed conservatively by limiting their PEEP and maximum inspiratory pressures and were followed by daily chest X-rays (CXR) for detection of any progress. None of the patients showed increase in size of their pneumothorax and/or pneumomediastinum. Hemodynamically instability due to pneumothorax and/or pneumomediastinum was not observed in any of the patients. Tension pneumothorax was not observed in any of the patients. Most common reason for death was sepsis due to secondary bacterial infections. Acute deterioration with rapid oxygen desaturation or palpation of crepitation over thorax and neck in a COVID-19 patient should prompt a search for pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. Conservative management may be an option as long as the patients are stable.","Talan, Leyla; Sasal Solmaz, F Gonca; Ercan, Ugur; Akdemir Kalkan, Irem; Yenigün, Bülent Mustafa; Yüksel, Cabir; Altintas, N Defne",Tuberk Toraks,,288

Individuals with minoritized sexual and gender identities are at a higher risk of experiencing such negative changes in their well-being. The objective of this study was to compare levels of well-being among cis-heterosexual individuals and individuals with minoritized sexual and gender identities during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Using data obtained in a cross-sectional online survey between April 20 to July 20, 2020 (N = 2332), we compared levels of well-being (WHO-5) across subgroups (cis-individuals with minoritized sexual identities, individuals with minoritized gender identities and cis-heterosexual individuals) applying univariate (two-sample t-test) and multivariate analysis (multivariate linear regression). RESULTS: Results indicate overall lower levels of well-being as well as lower levels of well-being in minoritized sexual or gender identities compared to cis-heterosexual individuals. Further, multivariate analyses revealed that living in urban communities as well as being in a relationship were positively associated with higher levels of well-being. Furthermore, a moderation analysis showed that being in a relationship reduces the difference between groups in terms of well-being. CONCLUSION: Access to mental healthcare for individuals with minoritized sexual and gender identities as well as access to gender-affirming resources should be strengthened during COVID-19 pandemic. Healthcare services with low barriers of access such as telehealth and online peer support groups should be made available, especially for vulnerable groups.","Buspavanich, Pichit; Lech, Sonia; Lermer, Eva; Fischer, Mirjam; Berger, Maximilian; Vilsmaier, Theresa; Kaltofen, Till; Keckstein, Simon; Mahner, Sven; Behr, Joachim; Thaler, Christian J; Batz, Falk",PLoS One,,288

The major route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is in contention, with the airborne route a likely transmission pathway for carrying the virus within indoor environments. Until now, there has been no evidence for detection of airborne severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and this may have implication for the potential spread of the COVID-19. We investigated the air of patient rooms with confirmed COVID-19 in the largest hospital in Iran, on March 17, 2020. To collect the SARS-CoV-2 particles, ten air samples were collected into the sterile standard midget impingers containing 20 mL DMEM with 100 µg/mL streptomycin, 100 U/mL penicillin and 1% antifoam reagent for 1 h. Besides, indoor particle number concentrations, CO2, relative humidity and temperature were recorded throughout the sampling duration. Viral RNA was extracted from samples taken from the impingers and Reverse-Transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was applied to confirm the positivity of collected samples based on the virus genome sequence. Fortunately, in this study all air samples which were collected 2 to 5 m from the patients' beds with confirmed COVID-19 were negative. Despite we indicated that all air samples were negative, however, we suggest further in vivo experiments should be conducted using actual patient cough, sneeze and breath aerosols in order to show the possibility of generation of the airborne size carrier aerosols and the viability fraction of the embedded virus in those carrier aerosols.","Faridi, Sasan; Niazi, Sadegh; Sadeghi, Kaveh; Naddafi, Kazem; Yavarian, Jila; Shamsipour, Mansour; Jandaghi, Nazanin Zahra Shafiei; Sadeghniiat, Khosro; Nabizadeh, Ramin; Yunesian, Masud; Momeniha, Fatemeh; Mokamel, Adel; Hassanvand, Mohammad Sadegh; MokhtariAzad, Talat",Sci Total Environ,,288

Eating behavior was examined in three ways: Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ), visual analog scales of subjective appetite sensations, and a food consumption test. Results: In all, 15 participants who were overweight and 50 with normal weight were analyzed. The overweight women were clustered into two groups according to the heartbeat perception task score: a low-score group (women with overweight who have low IA [OW-LOW]) and high-score group (women with overweight who have high IA [OW-HIGH]). The OW-LOW group had significantly smaller intermeal changes in hunger score compared with women with normal weight. The disinhibition score on the TFEQ for the OW-HIGH group was significantly higher than the normal-weight women, and the prospective consumption score in the fasting condition was significantly higher in women with normal weight and a high heartbeat perception task score. Conclusions: Overweight young women were characterized into two groups with different appetite and eating behavior, which is connected to the risk of overeating. An appetite characteristic is associated with a high risk of obesity among the normal-weight population. Individualized interventions tailored to the IA levels may help in improving and preventing obesity.","Nishimura, Akiko; Harashima, Shin-Ichi; Hosoda, Kiminori; Honda, Ikumi",,,288
410084,"Eculizumab, SARS-CoV-2 and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome",2020,"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been posing a substantial challenge to human survival and well-being, which rely on the actions and behaviors of individuals. It is essential that accurate information is distributed; however, misinformation has been spread via social media. Consequently, the resulting panic has to be addressed while putting essential public health measures in place. It is also important to explore the link between the social media exposure and well-being. Therefore, in the current study, we aimed to identify the levels of anxiety, depression, and social isolation among individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, we explored the relationship between exposure to misleading social media news and anxiety, depression, and social isolation. A cross sectional design was employed to collect data from 371 Saudi participants (aged 16-60 years), using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, and de Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale. Results showed that the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and social isolation was 47.82%, 47.57%, and 46.42%, respectively. Further, more than 83% of the participants reported using social media frequently during the pandemic. We found that exposure to misinformation via social media has a significant positive relationship with anxiety, depression, and social isolation. However, Due to the cross-sectional nature of this study it cannot be determined whether social media causes negative mental health outcomes, or if individuals experiencing greater depression, anxiety and social isolation turn to social media more than others, or if some third variable might explain both. Based on our findings, we present specific suggestions related to the COVID-19 pandemic to the government of Saudi Arabia. Minoring and filtering out misleading information with the cooperation of the World Health Organization (WHO) can promote the spread of accurate news in Saudi Arabia.","Hammad, Mohammad Ahmed; Alqarni, Turki Mahdi",PLoS One,,288

The objective of this study was to compare the use of a digital 3D exoscope system to that of a standard operating microscope as a neurosurgical visualization tool in a highly challenging, experimental setting. METHODS: End-to-side bypass procedures, each at a depth of 9 centimeters, were performed in a simulation setting. The quality of the task as well as the depth effect, visualization, magnification, illumination, and ergonomics were evaluated. RESULTS: No major differences were noted between the microscope and the exoscope in terms of the quality of the work. Working with the exoscope was more time-consuming than working with the microscope. Changing the depth and focus was faster using the operative microscope. The exoscope enabled higher magnification and it offered better ergonomic features. CONCLUSION: In a highly challenging, experimental setting, comparable procedural quality was found for both visualization modalities. Each had its own advantages and disadvantages. Over time and with technological advances, the digital 3D exoscope may become the main operative visualization system in microneurosurgery.","Hafez, Ahmad; Haeren, Roel H L; Dillmann, Johannes; Laakso, Aki; Niemelä, Mika; Lehecka, Martin",World neurosurgery (Online),,288

418290,"Computing systems, telehealth, and personal data: what is up?",2020,"WATERLIT Abstract: In the African context, there is a paucity of data on SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated COVID-19 in pregnancy. Given the endemicity of infections such as malaria, HIV, and tuberculosis (TB) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), it is important to evaluate coinfections with SARS-CoV-2 and their impact on maternal/infant outcomes. Robust research is critically needed to evaluate the effects of the added burden of COVID-19 in pregnancy, to help develop evidence-based policies toward improving maternal and infant outcomes. In this perspective, we briefly review current knowledge on the clinical features of COVID-19 in pregnancy;the risks of preterm birth and cesarean delivery secondary to comorbid severity;the effects of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection on the fetus/neonate;and in utero mother-to-child SARS-CoV-2 transmission. We further highlight the need to conduct multicountry surveillance as well as retrospective and prospective cohort studies across SSA. This will enable assessments of SARS-CoV-2 burden among pregnant African women and improve the understanding of the spectrum of COVID-19 manifestations in this population, which may be living with or without HIV, TB, and/or other coinfections/comorbidities. In addition, multicountry studies will allow a better understanding of risk factors and outcomes to be compared across countries and subregions. Such an approach will encourage and strengthen much-needed intra-African, south-to-south multidisciplinary and interprofessional research collaborations.

418652,Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Japanese COVID-19 patients,2021,"BACKGROUND: Pain is frequently encountered in the intensive care setting. Given the impact of pain assessment on patient outcomes and length of hospital stay, studies have been conducted to validate tools, establish guidelines and cast light on practices relating to pain assessment. OBJECTIVE: To examine the extent, range and nature of the evidence around pain assessment practices in adult patients who cannot self-report pain in the intensive care setting and summarise the findings from a heterogenous body of evidence to aid in the planning and the conduct of future research and management of patient care. The specific patient cohort studied was the sedated/ ventilated patient within the intensive care setting. DESIGN: A scoping review protocol utilised the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis extension for Scoping review checklist (PRISMA-ScR). METHODS: The review comprised of five phases: identifying the research question, identifying relevant studies, study selection, charting the data and collating, summarizing, and reporting the results. Databases were systematically searched from January to April 2020. Databases included were Scopus, Web of Science, Medline via Ovid, CINAHL COMPLETE via EBSCO host, Health Source and PUBMED. Limits were applied on dates (2000 to current), language (English), subject (human) and age (adult). Key words used were ""pain"", ""assessment"", ""measurement"", ""tools"", ""instruments"", ""practices"", ""sedated"", ""ventilated"", ""adult"". A hand search technique was used to search citations within articles. Database alerts were set to apprise the availability of research articles pertaining to pain assessment practices in the intensive care setting. RESULTS: The review uncovered literature categorised under five general themes: behaviour pain assessment tools, pain assessment guidelines, position statements and quality improvement projects, enablers and barriers to pain assessment, and evidence appertaining to actual practices. Behaviour pain assessment tools are the benchmark for pain assessment of sedated and ventilated patients. The reliability and validity of physiologic parameters to assess pain is yet to be determined. Issues of compliance with pain assessment guidelines and tools exist and impact on practices. In some countries like Australia, there is a dearth of information regarding the prevalence and characteristics of patients receiving analgesia, type of analgesia used, pain assessment practices and the process of recording pain management. In general, pain assessment varies across different intensive care settings and lacks consistency. CONCLUSION: Research on pain assessment practices requires further investigation to explore the causative mechanisms that contribute to poor compliance with established pain management guidelines. The protocol of this review was registered with Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/25a6) Tweetable abstract: Pain assessment in intensive care settings lacks consistency.

Therefore, in this study, we performed a differential gene expression analysis, pathway enrichment analysis, and gene ontology on RNAseq data obtained from SARS-CoV-2 infected A549 cells. Differential expression analysis revealed that 753 genes were up-regulated while 746 down-regulated. SNORA81, OAS2, SYCP2, LOC100506985, and SNORD35B are the top 5 upregulated genes upon SARS-Cov-2 infection. Expectedly, these genes have been implicated in the immune response to viral assaults. In the Ontology of protein classification, a high percentage of the genes are classified as Gene-specific transcriptional regulator, metabolite interconversion enzyme, and Protein modifying enzymes. Twenty pathways with P-value lower than 0.05 were enriched in the up-regulated genes while 18 pathways are enriched in the down-regulated DEGs. The toll-like receptor signalling pathway is one of the major pathways enriched. This pathway plays an important role in the innate immune system by identifying the pathogen-associated molecular signature emanating from various microorganisms. Taken together, our results present a novel understanding of genes and corresponding pathways upon SARS-Cov-2 infection, and could facilitate the identification of novel therapeutic targets and biomarkers in the treatment of COVID-19.","Soremekun, Opeyemi S.; Omolabi, Kehinde F.; Soliman, Mahmoud E.S.",Inform.

421489,Spontaneous Hinge-Bending Motions of Angiotensin I Converting Enzyme: Role in Activation and Inhibition,2020,"Structural racism has been and remains a fundamental cause of persistent health disparities in the United States. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the police killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and multiple others have been reminders that structural racism persists and restricts the opportunities for long, healthy lives of Black Americans and other historically disenfranchised groups. The American Heart Association has previously published statements addressing cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk and disparities among racial and ethnic groups in the United States, but these statements have not adequately recognized structural racism as a fundamental cause of poor health and disparities in cardiovascular disease. This presidential advisory reviews the historical context, current state, and potential solutions to address structural racism in our country. Several principles emerge from our review: racism persists; racism is experienced; and the task of dismantling racism must belong to all of society. It cannot be accomplished by affected individuals alone. The path forward requires our commitment to transforming the conditions of historically marginalized communities, improving the quality of housing and neighborhood environments of these populations, advocating for policies that eliminate inequities in access to economic opportunities, quality education, and health care, and enhancing allyship among racial and ethnic groups. Future research on racism must be accelerated and should investigate the joint effects of multiple domains of racism (structural, interpersonal, cultural, anti-Black). The American Heart Association must look internally to correct its own shortcomings and advance antiracist policies and practices regarding science, public and professional education, and advocacy. With this advisory, the American Heart Association declares its unequivocal support of antiracist principles.","Churchwell, Keith; Elkind, Mitchell S V; Benjamin, Regina M; Carson, April P; Chang, Edward K; Lawrence, Willie; Mills, Andrew; Odom, Tanya M; Rodriguez, Carlos J; Rodriguez, Fatima; Sanchez, Eduardo; Sharrief, Anjail Z; Sims, Mario; Williams, Olajide",Circulation,,288
425682,Clinical course and predictive risk factors for fatal outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with chronic kidney disease,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic crisis has had profound effects on global health, healthcare, and public health policy. It has also impacted education. Within undergraduate healthcare education of doctors, nurses, and allied professions, rapid shifts to distance learning and pedagogic content creation within new realities, demands of healthcare practice settings, shortened curricula, and/or earlier graduation have also challenged ethics teaching in terms of curriculum allotments or content specification. We propose expanding the notion of resilience to the field of ethics education under the conditions of remote learning. Educational resilience starts in the virtual classroom of ethics teaching, initially constituted as an ""unpurposed space"" of exchange about the pandemic's challenging impact on students and educators. This continuously transforms into ""purposed space"" of reflection, discovering ethics as a repertory of orientative knowledge for addressing the pandemic's challenges on personal, professional, societal, and global levels and for discovering (and then addressing) that the health of individuals and populations also has moral determinants. As such, an educational resilience framework with inherent adaptability rises to the challenge of supporting the moral agency of students acting both as professionals and as global citizens. Educational resilience is key in supporting and sustaining professional identify formation and facilitating the development of students' moral resilience and leadership amid moral complexity and potential moral transgression-not only but especially in times of pandemic.","Wald, Hedy S; Monteverde, Settimio",Nurs Ethics,,288

This study aimed to analyse the role of these skills in the emotional response of health professionals to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Before the COVID-19 outbreak, 48 doctors and 48 nurses participated in a simulation-based teamwork training program based on teaching non-technical skills through simulation. In May 2020, this group of professionals from a COVID-19 referral hospital was invited to participate in a survey exploring stress, anxiety, and depression, using the PSS-14 (Perceived Stress Scale) and the HADS (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) measures. A control group that did not receive the training was included. We conducted a logistic regression to assess whether having attended a simulation-based teamwork training program modified the probability of presenting psychological distress (PSS-14 > 18 or HADS> 12). RESULTS: A total of 141 healthcare professionals were included, 77 in the intervention group and 64 in the control group. Based on the PSS-14, 70.1% of the intervention group and 75% of the control group (p = 0.342) had symptoms of stress.

The purpose of this study is to detect such counterfeited drugs, using a reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method with fluorescence detection. Analysis was divided into three phases. In the first phase, a Plackett-Burman design (PBD) was used to screen five independent factors, namely, buffer pH, buffer concentration (mM), acetonitrile content (%), flow rate (mL/min) and triethylamine (TEA) content in the buffer preparation (%). The selected dependent variables were (resolution, symmetry of peaks and run time). The objective of the second phase was to optimize the method performance using Box-Behnken design (BBD) and desirability function for multiple response optimization to obtain the best chromatographic performance with the shortest run time. Optimal chromatographic separation was achieved on a YMC-pack pro C18 ODS-A column (15 cm x 4.6 mm, 5 micro m) at room temperature The optimum mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile and 5 mM sodium dihydrogen phosphate buffer containing 0.5% triethyamine (30:70, v/v) with the pH adjusted to 3.5 using an orthophosphoric acid solution. The flow rate was maintained at 1 mL/min, and the detection was performed with a fluorescence detector fixed at 380 nm (aemission) after excitation at 335 nm (aexcitation). The third phase was method validation according to ICH guidelines, providing to be specific, precise, accurate, and robust. The method is linear over a range of 0.4-8 micro g/mL for chloroquine and ASP, while for paracetamol it is linear over 16-48 micro g/mL. The developed RP-HPLC method was used for quantitation of the three drugs in chloroquine dosage form samples. The method shows a great tendency in the classification between the genuine chloroquine and the adulterated ones in pharmaceutical preparations and breast milk.","Hassanp, S.

Participants discussed their experienced SoC using the storyline method. In addition, course developers (n = 2) were interviewed and lecturers (n = 5) wrote an experience story. Audio- and video-recordings were transcribed verbatim and both the ensuing transcripts and experience stories were analysed using an inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: All students experienced an increase of SoC during the eight-week course. Five themes were identified: 'social contacts made possible by a physical campus', 'group dynamics', 'teacher influence', 'education format' and 'teachers' Sense of Community'. The authors formulated challenges and practical guidelines on how to build SoC based on these themes. CONCLUSIONS: This exploratory qualitative study provides a conceptual framework with practical guidelines for medical educators on how to build SoC in online medical preclerkship education. These guidelines provide a valuable starting point to build SoC in online education for medical educators and students alike.","van der Meer, Gerben H; Milota, Megan; de Jonge, Rosalein R; Jansen, Renée S",Med. educ,,288

437235,SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Viral Load Are Associated with the Upper Respiratory Tract Microbiome,2021,"Introduction: International migration is a social determinant of health. The past decade has seen a large exodus of Venezuelans within Latin America, including Chile. In the past months, the world has been facing the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic and its respiratory disease COVID-19. Objective: To explore what factors are associated with feeling prepared to face the COVID-19 pandemic among the Venezuelan population residing in Chile. Methods: Cross-sectional quantitative study with an opinion poll design. An online self-reported survey in Spanish and Creole was designed and piloted with experts and international migrants. It was disseminated to various international migrant groups through networks of migrant and pro-migrant organizations and the Chilean public health care network across the national territory. An effective sample size for analysis of 1690 participants was reached, of which 1008 (60%) were from Venezuela and included in this analysis. Feeling prepared to face the COVID-19 pandemic (yes/no) among Venezuelan migrants was described, as well as relevant variables like sex, level of education, length of stay, healthcare provision, anxiety or depression due to COVID-19, confinement, and evaluation of the quality of the information provided by the COVID-19 government. Results: 65% of the Venezuelan participants reported not feeling prepared for the pandemic. Compared to Venezuelan migrants who feel prepared to face the COVID-19 pandemic, migrants who reported not feeling prepared were in a higher proportion female, with secondary education level, had arrived in Chile in the past year, do not have a job but want to work, and belong to the public healthcare provision. Discussion: Receiving good quality information on the pandemic and mental health symptoms are important factors associated with feeling prepared to face COVID-19 in Venezuelan migrants in Chile, suggesting that increased attention towards the physical and mental health of Venezuelan migrants in Chile and the region is needed.","Cabieses, Báltica; Darrigrandi, Florencia; Blukacz, Alice; Obach, Alexandra; Silva, Claudia",Medwave,,288

438189,"Tolerability, safety and immunogenicity of intradermal delivery of a fractional dose mRNA -1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in healthy adults as a dose sparing strategy",2021,"BackgroundLatino have had higher case counts, hospitalization rates and deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic nationally and in the state of California. Meanwhile, Latino vaccination rates remain lower than those of non-Hispanic Whites. COVID-19 vaccine nonintent, defined as intent not to vaccinate for COVID-19, among Latino individuals continues to be an issue in the state of California. MethodsFamilies from three Latino longitudinal mother child cohorts previously recruited in the San Francisco Bay Area were surveyed telephonically from February to July 2021 to assess attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination and prior vaccination, in general, for themselves and their children. Risk for vaccine nonintent was assessed using Mann-Whitney rank sum non-parametric test for continuous predictors and chi-squared tests for categorical ones. ResultsThree hundred and eighteen families were surveyed from the Telomere at Birth (TAB), Hispanic Eating and Nutrition (HEN) and Latino Eating and Diabetes Cohort (LEAD). Approximately 36% from TAB and 28% from HEN/LEAD indicated COVID-19 vaccine nonintent for themselves and/or their children. Risk factors for vaccine nonintent included lower maternal age (p=0.01), concern about vaccine side effects (p<0.01) and prior history of a household members being infected with COVID-19 (p<0.01) and indexes of household crowding including number of people sharing a bathroom (p=0.048). Vaccine intent was also associated with receiving vaccine input from friends (p=0.03), family (p<0.01) and/or coworkers (p=0.02) compared with those who were not planning on getting COVID-19 vaccination. It is possible that those with non-intent have received limited input from families, friends and/or coworkers. DiscussionLatino families living in crowded living situations who may not have received any COVID-19 advice family, coworkers or friends are at particular risk for COVID-19 vaccine nonintent. Community based grassroots interventions that focus on trusted individuals with close ties to the community counseling about COVID-19 vaccination could help to boost vaccination rates in this population group.","Wojcicki, Janet; Escobar, Milagro; Mendez, Andrea De Castro; Martinez, Suzanne",,,288

DESIGN: We performed an observational, cross-sectional, descriptive study for which we designed a survey that was distributed in May 2020. SETTING: We included internists who worked in Spain during the COVID-19 outbreak. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1015 internists responded to the survey. Of those 62.9% were women. RESULTS: Of 1015 people, 58.3% presented with high emotional exhaustion, 61.5% had a high level of depersonalisation and 67.6% reported low personal fulfilment. 40.1% presented with the 3 criteria described, and therefore burn-out syndrome.Burn-out syndrome was independently related to the management of patients with SARS-CoV-2 (HR: 2.26; 95% CI 1.15 to 4.45), the lack of availability of personal protective equipment (HR: 1.41; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.91), increased responsibility (HR: 2.13; 95% CI 1.51 to 3.01), not having received financial compensation for overtime work (HR: 0.43; 95% CI 0.31 to 0.62), not having rested after 24-hour shifts (HR: 1.61; 95% CI 1.09 to 2.38), not having had holidays in the previous 6 months (HR: 1.36; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.84), consumption of sleeping pills (HR: 1.83; 95% CI 1.28 to 2.63) and higher alcohol intake (HR: 1.95; 95% CI 1.39 to 2.73). CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 outbreak, 40.1% of Internal Medicine physicians in Spain presented with burn-out syndrome, which was independently related to the assistance of patients with SARS-CoV-2, overworking without any compensation and the fear of being contagious to their relatives. Therefore, it is imperative to initiate programmes to prevent and treat burn-out in front-line physicians during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Macía-Rodríguez, Cristina; Alejandre de Oña, Álvaro; Martín-Iglesias, Daniel; Barrera-López, Lucía; Pérez-Sanz, María Teresa; Moreno-Diaz, Javier; González-Munera, Adriana",BMJ Open,,288

440613,More than Pneumonia: Distinctive Features of SARS-Cov-2 Infection. From Autopsy Findings to Clinical Implications: A Systematic Review,2020,"BACKGROUND: Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) is defined as glucose intolerance first identified during pregnancy. Delays in diagnosis and challenges in management can lead to serious adverse outcomes for the mother and child. As rates of GDM diagnosis increase worldwide, health systems and maternity services have become increasingly strained, especially with new restrictions around in-person care due to the current COVID-19 pandemic. Mobile health (mHealth) has increasingly shown promise for management of chronic disease, driven by smartphone adoption and increased internet connectivity. The aim of this work is to evaluate the adoption and multidisciplinary care coordination of an mHealth platform called Mâ¡THer in a cohort of women with first-time diagnosis of GDM. METHODS: A mHealth platform for GDM management was developed incorporating a smartphone application, clinician portal, and secure cloud data storage. Forty participants with a first-time diagnosis of GDM were recruited to use the app during their pregnancy. User attitudes from clinicians and women were captured through post-hoc surveys, and app-usage metrics. RESULTS: Clinicians and women indicated satisfaction and ease of use of the mHealth platform, with some technological challenges around wireless connectivity. Blood glucose reviews and antenatal contact were higher with use of the Mâ¡THer app as compared with a matched historical sample. CONCLUSION: The Mâ¡THer mHealth platform is a new comprehensive tool for healthcare of women with GDM, and may provide an effective new avenue to enhance multidisciplinary care in the face of COVID-19 disruptions and challenges to traditional care pathways.","Varnfield, Marlien; Redd, Christian; Stoney, Rachel; Higgins, Liesel; Scolari, Naomi; Warwick, Roisine; Iedema, Joel; Rundle, Jane; Dutton, Wendy",Diabetes Technol Ther,,288

There is evidence that Covid-19 causes gastrointestinal symptoms and abnormalities in liver enzymes. We aimed to determine if hepatobiliary laboratory data could predict disease severity in patients with Covid-19. In this retrospective, single institution, cohort study that analyzed patients admitted to a community academic hospital with the diagnosis of Covid-19, we found that elevations of Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST), Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) and Alkaline Phosphatase (AP) at any time during hospital admission increased the odds of ICU admission by 5.12 (95% CI: 1.55-16.89; p = 0.007), 4.71 (95% CI: 1.51-14.69; p = 0.01) and 4.12 (95% CI: 1.21-14.06, p = 0.02), respectively. Hypoalbuminemia found at the time of admission to the hospital was associated with increased mortality (p = 0.02), hypotension (p = 0.03), and need for vasopressors (p = 0.02), intubation (p = 0.01) and hemodialysis (p = 0.002). Additionally, there was evidence of liver injury: AST was significantly elevated above baseline in patients admitted to the ICU (54.2 ± 15.70 U/L) relative to those who were not (9.2 ± 4.89 U/L; p = 0.01). Taken together, this study found that hypoalbuminemia and abnormalities in hepatobiliary laboratory data may be prognostic factors for disease severity in patients admitted to the hospital with Covid-19.","Wagner, Jason; Garcia-Rodriguez, Victor; Yu, Abraham; Dutra, Barbara; Larson, Scott; Cash, Brooks; DuPont, Andrew; Farooq, Ahmad",Sci Rep,,288

444944,A cluster of health care workers with COVID-19 pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2,2020,"The recent COVID-19 pandemic, which was first detected in Wuhan, China, has been linked to increased anti-Chinese sentiment in the United States. Recently, Broniatowski et al. found that foreign powers, and especially Russia, were implicated in information operations using public health crises to promote discord -- including racial conflict -- in American society (Broniatowski, 2018). This brief considers the problem of automatically detecting changes in overall attitudes, that may be associated with emerging information operations, via artificial intelligence. Accurate analysis of these emerging topics usually requires laborious, manual analysis by experts to annotate millions of tweets to identify biases in new topics. We introduce extensions of the Word Embedding Association Test from Caliskan et. al to a new domain (Caliskan, 2017). This practical and unsupervised method is applied to quantify biases being promoted in information operations. Analyzing historical information operations from Russia's interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections, we quantify biased attitudes for presidential candidates, and sentiment toward Muslim groups. We next apply this method to a corpus of tweets containing anti-Chinese hashtags. We find that roughly 1% of tweets in our corpus reference Russian-funded news sources and use anti-Chinese hashtags and, beyond the expected anti-Chinese attitudes, we find that this corpus as a whole contains pro-Russian attitudes, which are not present in a control Twitter corpus containing general tweets. Additionally, 4% of the users in this corpus were suspended within a week. These findings may indicate the presence of abusive account activity associated with rapid changes in attitudes around the COVID-19 public health crisis, suggesting potential information operations.","Toney, Autumn; Pandey, Akshat; Guo, Wei; Broniatowski, David; Caliskan, Aylin",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.08726v1.pdf,288

The urgent and massive demand for testing prompted swift development of assays to detect SARS-CoV-2. The objective of this study was to assess the accuracy of these newly developed tests. METHODS: The American Proficiency Institute sent 2 test samples to 346 clinical laboratories in order to assess the accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 assays. The positive sample, containing 5,175 viral copies/mL, was fully extractable with SARS-CoV-2 viral capsid protein and RNA. The negative sample, with 3,951 viral copies/mL, contained recombinant virus particles with sequences for targeting human RNAase P gene sequences. RESULTS: Of the laboratories submitting results, 97.4% (302/310) correctly detected the virus when present and 98.3% (296/301) correctly indicated when the virus was not present. Among incorrect results reported in this proficiency challenge, 76.9% (10/13) were likely related to clerical error. This accounts for 1.6% (10/611) of all reported results. CONCLUSIONS: Overall performance in this SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection challenge was excellent, providing confidence in the results of these new molecular tests and assurance for the clinical and public health decisions based on these test results.","Edson, Daniel C; Casey, Danielle L; Harmer, Susan E; Downes, Frances P",Am J Clin Pathol,,288

We examined the prevalence and correlates of HHP in adolescents. We used nationally representative data from the Global School-based Student Health Survey (2003-2017) from 92 countries. HHP were categorized as ""appropriate"", ""inappropriate"" and ""lacking"" based on the information about ""hand washing before eating"", ""hand washing after using the toilet"", and ""hand washing with soap"". Multinomial logistic regression analyses were used to assess the role of socio-demographic, health, lifestyle, school, and family-related variables in HHP. Among 354,422 adolescents (13-17 years), only 30.3% were found to practice appropriate hand hygiene. Multivariable models suggest that sedentary behavior (adjusted relative risk ratio (ARRR) 1.41, 95% CI 1.31-1.51)), and bullying victimization (ARRR 1.20, 95% CI 1.10-1.30) promoted inappropriate HHP. In contrast, parental supervision (ARRR 0.55, 95% CI 0.50-0.59) and parental bonding (ARRR 0.81, 95% CI 0.75-0.87) were protective against inappropriate HHP. From a policy perspective, hand hygiene promotion policies and programs should focus on both school (bullying, exercise) and family-level factors (parental supervision and parental bonding) factors.","Jatrana, Santosh; Hasan, Md Mehedi; Mamun, Abdullah A; Fatima, Yaqoot",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,288

451510,Neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in dialysis patients after the first dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine: the war is far from being won,2021,"OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical characteristics of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 at Clinique Ngaliema, a public hospital, in Kinshasa, in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed medical records including socio-demographics, past medical history, clinical manifestation, comorbidities, laboratory data, treatment and disease outcome of 160 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, with confirmed result of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection. RESULTS: The median age of patients was 54 years (IQR: 38-64), and there was no significant gender difference (51% of male). The most common comorbidities were hypertension (55 [34%]), diabetes (31 [19%]) and obesity (13 [8%]). Fever (93 [58%]), cough (92 [57%]), fatigue (87 [54%]), shortness of breath (72 [45%]) and myalgia (33 [21%]) were the most common symptoms, upon admission. Patients were categorized into mild (92 [57%]), moderate (19 [12%]) and severe (49 [31%]). Severe patients were older and were more likely to have comorbidities, compared to mild ones. The majority of patients (92% [147 of 160]) patients received hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine phosphate. Regression model revealed that older age, lower SpO2, higher heart rate and elevated AST at admission were all risk factors associated with in-hospital death. The prevalence of COVID-19 and malaria co-infection was 0.63% and 70 (44%) of all patients received antimalarial treatment before hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicated that the epidemiological and clinical feature of COVID-19 patients in Kinshasa are broadly similar to previous reports from other settings. Older age, lower SpO2, tachycardia, and elevated AST could help to identify patients at higher risk of death at an early stage of the illness. Plasmodium spp co-infection was not common in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.","Matangila, Junior Rika; Nyembu, Ritha Kibambe; Telo, Gloire Mosala; Ngoy, Christian Djuba; Sakobo, Taty Msueun; Massolo, Joel Mbembo; Muyembe, Blandine Mbo; Mvwala, Richard Kapela; Ilunga, Cedric Kabemba; Limbole, Emmanuel Bakilo; Ntalaja, Jeff Mukengeshay; Kongo, Roger Minga",PLoS One,,288

452261,Respiratory failure in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2,2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic disease, originated in Wuhan City, China. It is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its biology is still poorly understood. Currently, there are no vaccines and drugs/or agents that can reduce severity of this new disease. Recent data suggest that patients with age-related comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and dementia are highly susceptible to severe respiratory illness due to coronavirus infection. Recent research also revealed that aged individuals with elevated baseline inflammation cause defects in T and B cells, leading to decreased body's immune response to viral infection. In the current article, we discuss the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on age-related chronic diseases, such as diabetes, obesity, and Alzheimer's disease. Our article also highlights the interaction between coronavirus and immune cells, and how COVID-19 alters mitochondrial activities in host cells. Based on new and compelling evidence, we propose that mitochondrial fission is inhibited while fusion is promoted, causing mitochondrial elongation and providing a receptive intracellular environment for viral replication in infected cells. Further research is still needed to understand the cross talk between viral replication in mitochondria and disease progression in patients with COVID-19.","Holder, Katherine; Reddy, P Hemachandra",Neuroscientist,,288

The structure and phase-behavior of single and double bilayers of 1,2-dipalmitoylphosphoethanolamine (DPPE) were investigated by specular neutron reflectivity for their viability as biomembrane mimics. Whilst single bilayer samples were found to exhibit stable gel and fluid structures, double bilayers were found to be intrinsically unstable in the fluid phase as a planar structure. A Bragg peak was observed in the reflectivity data at just above the gel-to-fluid transition temperature, indicating the partial rearrangement of the upper bilayer into a repeat stacked structure. The lower bilayer was structurally stable. The structure and phase-behaviour of a double bilayer containing a ratio of 9 : 1 DPPE/cholesterol was also investigated to assess the stabilising effect of cholesterol on the upper bilayer. The presence of cholesterol completely destabilised the upper bilayer, causing it to detach 7 °C below the gel-to-fluid transition temperature of DPPE. It is possible that the cholesterol increases the overall conical shape of DPPE molecule by residing in the chain region of the lipid.","Stidder, Barry; Fragneto, Giovanna; Roser, Stephen J",Soft Matter,,288

In this study, we present the results of infectivity testing of the body and testing of mortuary staff for SARS-CoV-2. We performed real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) for SARS-CoV-2 on 33 decedents with ante mortem confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Swabs of the body surface from five different body regions and from the body bag or coffin were examined. A subset of the swabs was brought into cell culture. In addition, screening of 25 Institute of Legal Medicine (ILM) personnel for ongoing or past SARS-CoV-2 infection was performed at two different time points during the pandemic. Swabs from all locations of the body surface and the body environment were negative in cases of negative post mortem nasopharyngeal testing (n=9). When the post mortem nasopharyngeal swab tested positive (n=24), between 0 and 5 of the body surface swabs were also positive, primarily the perioral region. In six of the cases, the body bag also yielded a positive result. The longest postmortem interval with positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR at the body surface was nine days. In no case viable SARS-CoV-2 was found on the skin of the bodies or the body bags. One employee (autopsy technician) had possible occupational infection with SARS-CoV-2; all other employees were tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antibody twice.

Conventional approaches undertaken to this end, like, high-throughput virtual screening require extensive combing through existing datasets in the hope of finding possible matches. In this study we propose a computational strategy for de novo generation of molecules with high binding affinities to the specified target. A deep generative model is built using a stack augmented recurrent neural network for initially generating drug like molecules and then it is optimized using reinforcement learning to start generating molecules with desirable properties--primarily the binding affinity. The reinforcement learning section of the pipeline is further extended to multi-objective optimization showcasing the model's ability to generate molecules with a wide variety of properties desirable for drug like molecules, like, LogP, Quantitative Estimate of Drug Likeliness etc.. For multi-objective optimization, we have devised a novel strategy in which the property being used to calculate the reward is changed periodically. In comparison to the conventional approach of taking a weighted sum of all rewards, this strategy shows enhanced ability to generate a significantly higher number of molecules with desirable properties.","Manan, Goel Shampa Raghunathan Siddhartha Laghuvarapu Priyakumar U.

The conditional overexpression of mazF, the endoribonuclease toxin of the MazEF toxin-antitoxin system in Staphylococcus aureus, is one approach to induce bacterial growth arrest, but its targets remain largely unknown. We used overexpression of mazF and high-throughput sequence analysis following the exact mapping of non-phosphorylated transcriptome ends (nEMOTE) technique to reveal in vivo toxin cleavage sites on a global scale. We obtained a catalogue of MazF cleavage sites and unearthed an extended MazF cleavage specificity that goes beyond the previously reported one. We correlated transcript cleavage and abundance in a global transcriptomic profiling during mazF overexpression. We observed that MazF affects RNA molecules involved in ribosome biogenesis, cell wall synthesis, cell division and RNA turnover and thus deliver a plausible explanation for how mazF overexpression induces stasis. We hypothesize that autoregulation of MazF occurs by directly modulating the MazEF operon, such as the rsbUVW genes that regulate the sigma factor SigB, including an observed cleavage site on the MazF mRNA that would ultimately play a role in entry and exit from bacterial stasis.","Sierra, Roberto; Prados, Julien; Panasenko, Olesya O; Andrey, Diego O; Fleuchot, Betty; Redder, Peter; Kelley, William L; Viollier, Patrick H; Renzoni, Adriana",Nucleic Acids Res,,288

We used the issue of asymptomatic cases to illustrate the importance that should still be given to preventive measures such as hand washing, mask wearing, physical and social distancing, knowing that vaccines have never been 100% effective. Also with the issue of variants in COVID-19, the vaccine couldn't be considered as a panacea. Lessons from the Nordic countries are strong arguments to put emphasis on preventive measures in the region.","Houeto, D.; Daga, F.; Time, A.; Honhonou, R.; Agonnoude, M.",Open Journal of Preventive Medicine,,288

This study was carried out to determine the diagnostic accuracy of saliva for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in ambulatory children. METHODS: During 1 to 23 October 2020, we recruited a population-based sample of children presenting for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) screening in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Each child provided paired nasopharyngeal (NP) swab and saliva for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR N, E and RdRp gene detection. RESULTS: Paired NP swab and saliva samples were obtained from 476 children with mean ± standard deviation age of 10.8 ± 3.9 years, and 58.2% were male (277/476). Nine participants were sampled twice, so 485 pairs of NP swab/saliva were tested. Virus detection in at least one specimen type was reported in 17.9% (87/485), with similar detection in NP swab (16.7%, 81/485) and saliva (15.9%, 77/485). Sensitivity and specificity of saliva RT-PCR was 87.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 78.5-93.9) and 98.5% (95% CI 96.8-99.5). The positive and negative predictive values were 92.2% (95% CI 84.2-96.3) and 97.6% (95% CI 95.7-98.6), with a kappa coefficient of 0.879 (95% CI 0.821-0.937). Concordance of findings between NP swab and saliva did not differ by age (p 0.67) or gender (p 0.29). Cycle threshold (Ct) values were significantly higher in NP swab/saliva pairs with discordant findings compared to those with both specimens positive. CONCLUSIONS: In light of these findings, we recommend saliva as a diagnostic specimen for COVID-19 screening in children.","Al Suwaidi, Hanan; Senok, Abiola; Varghese, Rupa; Deesi, Zulfa; Khansaheb, Hamda; Pokasirakath, Sabeel; Chacko, Bino; Abufara, Ibrahim; Loney, Tom; Alsheikh-Ali, Alawi",Clin. microbiol. infect,,288

However, with far fewer hospitalisations and deaths per case during the recent growth in cases compared with 2020, it is intended that all remaining social distancing legislation in England will be removed from 19 July 2021. MethodsWe report interim results from round 13 of the REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study in which a cross-sectional sample of the population of England was asked to provide a throat and nose swab for RT-PCR and to answer a questionnaire. Data collection for this report (round 13 interim) was from 24 June to 5 July 2021. ResultsIn round 13 interim, we found 237 positives from 47,729 swabs giving a weighted prevalence of 0.59% (0.51%, 0.68%) which was approximately four-fold higher compared with round 12 at 0.15% (0.12%, 0.18%). This resulted from continued exponential growth in prevalence with an average doubling time of 15 (13, 17) days between round 12 and round 13. However, during the recent period of round 13 interim only, we observed a shorter doubling time of 6.1 (4.0, 12) days with a corresponding R number of 1.87 (1.40, 2.45). There were substantial increases in all age groups under the age of 75 years, and especially at younger ages, with the highest prevalence in 13 to 17 year olds at 1.33% (0.97%, 1.82%) and in 18 to 24 years olds at 1.40% (0.89%, 2.18%). Infections have increased in all regions with the largest increase in London where prevalence increased more than eight-fold from 0.13% (0.08%, 0.20%) in round 12 to 1.08% (0.79%, 1.47%) in round 13 interim. Overall, prevalence was over 3 times higher in the unvaccinated compared with those reporting two doses of vaccine in both round 12 and round 13 interim, although there was a similar proportional increase in prevalence in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals between the two rounds. DiscussionWe are entering a critical period with a number of important competing processes: continued vaccination rollout to the whole adult population in England, increased natural immunity through infection, reduced social mixing of children during school holidays, increased proportion of mixing occurring outdoors during summer, the intended full opening of hospitality and entertainment and cessation of mandated social distancing and mask wearing. Surveillance programmes are essential during this next phase of the epidemic to provide clear evidence to the government and the public on the levels and trends in prevalence of infections and their relationship to vaccine coverage, hospitalisations, deaths and Long COVID.","Riley, Steven; Eales, Oliver; Haw, David; Wang, Haowei; Walters, Caroline E.; Ainslie, Kylie E.C.; Atchinson, Christina; Fronterre, Claudio; Diggle, Peter J.; Ashby, Deborah; Donnelly, Christl A; Barclay, Wendy; Cooke, Graham; Ward, Helen; Darzi, Ara; Elliott, Paul",,,288

Organophosphates are among such hazardous compounds that are ubiquitous in nature. They fuel oxidative stress to impair antiviral immune response in living entities. Aside, organophosphates promote cytokine burst and pyroptosis in broncho-alveolar chambers leading to severe respiratory ailments. At present, we witness COVID-19 outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2. Infection triggers cytokine storm coupled with inflammatory manifestations and pulmonary disorders in patients. Since organophosphate-exposure promotes necroinflammation and respiratory troubles hence during current pandemic situation, additional exposure to such chemicals can exacerbate inflammatory outcome and pulmonary maladies in patients, or pre-exposure to organophosphates might turn-out to be a risk factor for compromised immunity. Fortunately, antioxidants alleviate organophosphate-induced immunosuppression and hence under co-exposure circumstances, dietary intake of antioxidants would be beneficial to boost immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Rajak, Prem; Ganguly, Abhratanu; Sarkar, Saurabh; Mandi, Moutushi; Dutta, Moumita; Podder, Sayanti; Khatun, Salma; Roy, Sumedha",Food Chem Toxicol,,288

482457,Anti-HLA and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19,2021,"PURPOSE: The SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to a severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with prolonged mechanical ventilation and high mortality rate. Interestingly, COVID-19-associated ARDS share biological and clinical features with sepsis-associated immunosuppression since lymphopenia and acquired infections associated with late mortality are frequently encountered. Mechanisms responsible for COVID-19-associated lymphopenia need to be explored since they could be responsible for delayed virus clearance and increased mortality rate among intensive care unit (ICU) patients. METHODS: A series of 26 clinically annotated COVID-19 patients were analyzed by thorough phenotypic and functional investigations at days 0, 4, and 7 after ICU admission. RESULTS: We revealed that, in the absence of any difference in demographic parameters nor medical history between the two groups, ARDS patients presented with an increased number of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and a decreased number of CD8pos effector memory cell compared to patients hospitalized for COVID-19 moderate pneumonia. Interestingly, COVID-19-related MDSC expansion was directly correlated to lymphopenia and enhanced arginase activity. Lastly, T cell proliferative capacity in vitro was significantly reduced among COVID-19 patients and could be restored through arginine supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: The present study reports a critical role for MDSC in COVID-19-associated ARDS. Our findings open the possibility of arginine supplementation as an adjuvant therapy for these ICU patients, aiming to reduce immunosuppression and help virus clearance, thereby decreasing the duration of mechanical ventilation, nosocomial infection acquisition, and mortality.","Reizine, Florian; Lesouhaitier, Mathieu; Gregoire, Murielle; Pinceaux, Kieran; Gacouin, Arnaud; Maamar, Adel; Painvin, Benoit; Camus, Christophe; Le Tulzo, Yves; Tattevin, Pierre; Revest, Matthieu; Le Bot, Audrey; Ballerie, Alice; Cador-Rousseau, Berengère; Lederlin, Mathieu; Lebouvier, Thomas; Launey, Yoann; Latour, Maelle; Verdy, Clotilde; Rossille, Delphine; Le Gallou, Simon; Dulong, Joelle; Moreau, Caroline; Bendavid, Claude; Roussel, Mikael; Cogne, Michel; Tarte, Karin; Tadié, Jean-Marc",J. clin. immunol,,288

Fifty-eight COVID-19 patients were recruited in the Medicine Department of the hospital ""12 de Octubre,"" 55 patients remaining after losses to follow-up. Four groups were established according to maximum degree of disease progression. T-helper cell percentages and phenotypes, analyzed by flow cytometer, and serum cytokines levels, analyzed by Luminex, were evaluated when the microbiological diagnosis (acute phase) of the disease was obtained. Our study found a significant reduction of %Th1 and %Th17 cells with higher activated %Th2 cells in the COVID-19 patients compared with reference population. A higher percent of senescent Th2 cells was found in the patients who died than in those who survived. Senescent Th2 cell percentage was an independent risk factor for death (OR: 13.88) accompanied by the numbers of total lymphocytes (OR: 0.15) with an AUC of 0.879. COVID-19 patients showed a profile of pro-inflammatory serum cytokines compared to controls, with higher levels of IL-2, IL-6, IL-15, and IP-10. IL-10 and IL-13 were also elevated in patients compared to controls. Patients who did not survive presented significantly higher levels of IL-15 than those who recovered.

SARS-CoV-2 is an extremely contagious virus that is spreading rapidly all over the world and the scientific community is working tirelessly to find an effective treatment. This paper aims to determine the origin of this virus by comparing its nucleic acid sequence with all members of the coronaviridae family. This study uses a new approach based on the combination of three powerful techniques which are: Ngrams (For text categorization), Principal Component Analysis (For dimensionality reduction) and Random Forest algorithm (For supervised classification). The experimental results have shown that a large set of SARS-CoV-2 genomes, collected from different locations around the world, present significant similarities to those found in pangolins. This finding confirms some previous results obtained by other methods, which also suggest that pangolins should be considered as possible hosts in the emergence of the new coronavirus.","El Boujnouni, Hamoucha; Rahouti, Mohamed; El Boujnouni, Mohamed",Inform Med Unlocked,,288

494409,Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score in Patients Infected with Sars Cov-2,2020,"BACKGROUND: Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with hypothalamic dysfunction leading to obesity and behavioral disabilities, including eating disorders (EDs). We evaluated the effects of the COVID-19 infection and lockdown on mental and physical health in PWS. At the end of April, 85 adults with PWS completed a self-administered questionnaire, including lockdown conditions, physical activity (PA), ED, and medical and behavioral outcomes. Body weight was measured at home and self-reported. RESULTS: Patients (52.9% women, 44.8% disomic) were assessed, with a mean age of 28.05 ± 8.73 years and body mass index (BMI) of 36.76 ± 10.74 kg/m2. Seventy percent lived in the Paris region (France) and were confined with their parents. The mean weight change was 0.96 ± 3.28 kg. We compared patients showing weight loss (n = 39, - 3.30 ± 2.93 kg) to patients showing weight gain (n = 22, + 2.35 ± 1.54 kg): the BMI was lower (34.60 ± 9.18 versus 40.45 ± 9.45 kg/m2, p = 0.02), PA increased (25.6% versus 4.5%, p = 0.04), and EDs improved (51.3% versus 13.6%, p = 0.005). Behavioral disorders increased for 12.9% of the cohort. Three individuals (3.5%) were diagnosed with non-severe COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with positive effects for most French adults with PWS, with weight loss probably associated with a more favourable environment during this period. We observed no severe forms of COVID-19.","Mosbah, Helena; Coupaye, Muriel; Jacques, Flavien; Tauber, Maithé; Clément, Karine; Oppert, Jean-Michel; Poitou, Christine",Orphanet J Rare Dis,,288

495978,Impact of SARS-COV-2 on the clinical outcomes and placental pathology of pregnant women and their infants: a systematic review,2021,"OBJECTIVE: The management of the COVID-19 outbreak occurred in Lombardy (Italy) implied that non-COVID-19 health care was remodeled, limiting adequate resources in non-hospital public dental healthcare settings. This situation offered the opportunity to investigate the occupational COVID-19 risk to dental staff in public non-hospital dental units. METHODS: An infection control protocol was designed for dental health care in the Territorial Health and Social Services Authority (ASST) ""Melegnano and Martesana"" (Milan). Since specific guidance from central authorities was lacking, information was gathered from international public health organizations. The probability to visit asymptomatic COVID-19-infected patients was estimated, and the occupational risk to dental staff was calculated. RESULTS: The probability to visit asymptomatic patients passed from 1.2% (95% confidence interval -95 CI, 0.6%-2.5%) in the first period (20 February-15 March 2020) to 11.1% (95 CI, 5.8%-23.6%) in the second period (16 March-30 April). Dentists and dental assistants did not develop COVID-19, while one nurse did, the nature of her occupational risk was unclear, as nurses provided prevalently non-dental health care. The probabilities of developing COVID-19 per worked hour per person excluding and including this uncertain situation were 0.0% (95 CI, 0.0%-3.2%) and 0.9% (95 CI, 0.1%-4.7%). CONCLUSION: Relatively simple infection control procedures were enough to control occupational COVID-19 risk during the outbreak.","Nardone, Michele; Cordone, Angelo; Petti, Stefano",Oral dis,,288

504896,Neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 - a systematic review,2020,"Introduction: The first reported UK case of COVID-19 occurred on 30 January 2020. A lockdown from 24 March was partially relaxed on 10 May. One model to forecast disease spread depends on clinical parameters and transmission rates. Output includes the basic reproduction number R 0 and the log growth rate r in the exponential phase. Methods: Office for National Statistics data on deaths in England and Wales is used to estimate r. A likelihood for the transmission parameters is defined from a gaussian density for r using the mean and standard error of the estimate. Parameter samples from the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm lead to an estimate and credible interval for R 0 and forecasts for cases and deaths. Results: The UK initial log growth rate is r = 0.254 with s.e. 0.004. R 0 = 6.94 with 95% CI (6.52, 7.39). In a 12 week lockdown from 24 March with transmission parameters reduced throughout to 5% of their previous values, peaks of around 90,000 severely and 25,000 critically ill patients, and 44,000 cumulative deaths are expected by 16 June. With transmission rising from 5% in mid-April to reach 30%, 50,000 deaths and 475,000 active cases are expected in mid-June. Had such a lockdown begun on 17 March, around 30,000 (28,000, 32,000) fewer cumulative deaths would be expected by 9 June. Discussion: The R 0 estimate is compatible with some international estimates but over twice the value quoted by the UK government. An earlier lockdown could have saved many thousands of lives.","Dropkin, Greg",Front Public Health,,288

We characterized the stability of SARS-CoV-2 in three water matrices: fresh, tap, and seawater. The minimum infective dose of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells was confirmed to be 10³ PFU/mL. The stability of SARS-CoV-2 varied according to the water matrix: infective SARS-CoV-2 was undetectable after treatment with fresh water and seawater, but remained detectable for 2 days in tap water, when starting with an initial concentration of 104 PFU/mL. When the starting concentration was increased to 105 PFU/mL, a similar trend was observed. In addition, viral RNA persisted longer than infectious virus in all water matrices. This study was conducted in stagnant water containing a significantly high titer of virus, thus, human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through the actual aquatic environment is expected to be rare.","Lee, Young Jae; Kim, Je Hyoung; Choi, Byeong Sun; Choi, Jang Hoon; Jeong, Young Il",J.

509552,Antibody Response to 2-Dose SARS-CoV-2 mRNA Vaccination in Pediatric Solid Organ Transplant Recipients,2021,"Background - The mesenchymal stem cell (MSC), known to remodel in disease and have an extensive secretome, has recently been isolated from the human heart. However, the effects of normal and diseased cardiac MSCs on myocyte electrophysiology remain unclear. We hypothesize that in disease the inflammatory secretome of cardiac hMSCs remodels and can regulate arrhythmia substrates. Methods - Human cardiac MSCs (hMSCs) were isolated from patients with or without heart failure from tissue attached to extracted device leads and from samples taken from explanted/donor hearts. Failing hMSCs or non-failing hMSCs were co-cultured with normal human myocytes (hCM) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells. Using fluorescent indicators, APD, Ca2+ alternans, and spontaneous calcium release (SCR) incidence were determined. Results - Failing and non-failing hMSCs from both sources exhibited similar tri-lineage differentiation potential and cell surface marker expression as bone marrow hMSCs. Compared to non-failing hMSCs, failing hMSCs prolonged APD by 24% (p<0.001, n=15), increased Ca2+ alternans by 300% (p<0.001, n=18), and promoted SCR activity (n=14, p <0.013) in hCM. Failing hMSCs exhibited increased secretion of inflammatory cytokines IL-1ß (98%, p<0.0001) and IL-6 (460%, p <0.02) compared to non-failing hMSCs. IL-1ß or IL-6 in the absence of hMSCs prolonged APD but only IL-6 increased Ca2+ alternans and promoted SCR activity in hCM, replicating the effects of failing hMSCs. In contrast, non-failing hMSCs prevented Ca2+ alternans in hCM during oxidative stress. Finally, non-failing hMSCs exhibited >25 times higher secretion of IGF-1 compared to failing hMSCs. Importantly, IGF-1 supplementation or anti-IL-6 treatment rescued the arrhythmia substrates induced by failing hMSCs. Conclusions - We identified device leads as a novel source of cardiac hMSCs. Our findings show that cardiac hMSCs can regulate arrhythmia substrates by remodeling their secretome in disease. Importantly, therapy inhibiting (anti-IL-6) or mimicking (IGF-1) the cardiac hMSC secretome can rescue arrhythmia substrates.","Sattayaprasert, Prasongchai; Vasireddi, Sunil K; Bektik, Emre; Jeon, Oju; Hajjiri, Mohammad; Mackall, Judith A; Moravec, Christine S; Alsberg, Eben; Fu, Jidong; Laurita, Kenneth R",Circ.

RESULTS: More than half (67.5%, n = 295) of NGNs reported changes to clinical experiences, ranging from 0 to 240 hours transitioned to virtual (n = 187; median, 51; interquartile range, 24-80). NGNs fear missing important details or doing something wrong in providing patient care. They identified the need for preceptor support, guidance, teaching, and continued practice of skills. CONCLUSION: Recommendations are clear communication with leadership, advocacy from the nurse residency program, and targeted clinical and emotional support for NGNs.","Smith, Susan M; Buckner, Martha; Jessee, Mary Ann; Robbins, Veronica; Horst, Tessa; Ivory, Catherine H",Nurse Educ,,288
514267,"Liver injury, SARS-COV-2 infection and COVID-19: What physicians should really know?",2021,"Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have been crucial in curbing COVID-19 in the United States (US). Consequently, relaxing NPIs through a phased re-opening of the US amid still-high levels of COVID-19 susceptibility could lead to new epidemic waves. This calls for a COVID-19 early warning system. Here we evaluate multiple digital data streams as early warning indicators of increasing or decreasing state-level US COVID-19 activity between January and June 2020. We estimate the timing of sharp changes in each data stream using a simple Bayesian model that calculates in near real-time the probability of exponential growth or decay. Analysis of COVID-19-related activity on social network microblogs, Internet searches, point-of-care medical software, and a metapopulation mechanistic model, as well as fever anomalies captured by smart thermometer networks, shows exponential growth roughly 2-3 weeks prior to comparable growth in confirmed COVID-19 cases and 3-4 weeks prior to comparable growth in COVID-19 deaths across the US over the last 6 months. We further observe exponential decay in confirmed cases and deaths 5-6 weeks after implementation of NPIs, as measured by anonymized and aggregated human mobility data from mobile phones. Finally, we propose a combined indicator for exponential growth in multiple data streams that may aid in developing an early warning system for future COVID-19 outbreaks. These efforts represent an initial exploratory framework, and both continued study of the predictive power of digital indicators as well as further development of the statistical approach are needed.","Kogan, Nicole E.; Clemente, Leonardo; Liautaud, Parker; Kaashoek, Justin; Link, Nicholas B.; Nguyen, Andre T.; Lu, Fred S.; Huybers, Peter; Resch, Bernd; Havas, Clemens; Petutschnig, Andreas; Davis, Jessica; Chinazzi, Matteo; Mustafa, Backtosch; Hanage, William P.; Vespignani, Alessandro; Santillana, Mauricio",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.00756v2.pdf,288
516290,SARS-CoV-2 emergency in the workplace: are companies ready to protect their workers? A cross-sectional survey,2020,"The challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic face different institutional structures and traditions of action in the European health systems. This article uses the example of the public health services in Sweden, France and Austria to address the question of the similarities and differences in the measures taken to combat the pandemic (status: November 2020).Among the countries presented in this article, Austria is the least affected by the pandemic and France is the most affected. In all analysed health systems there is a tension between national and regional responsibilities. France's healthcare system is particularly centralized, while Sweden's is strongly regional and municipal. Governments in the nation states are striving to obtain pandemic containment powers independent of parliamentary decisions. Sweden differs from Austria and France in that its pandemic containment strategy is based primarily on recommendations and appeals rather than directives and bans. The sequences of action during the pandemic and, apart from Sweden, the instruments used to contain the pandemic are similar. The course of the pandemic and the measures taken in Austria and France show clear parallels with those in Germany. The protection of particularly vulnerable groups has not been sufficiently successful in all countries and remains a challenge to be met.","Gerlinger, Thomas; Schmidt, Phillip Florian; Lückenbach, Caspar",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,,288

In particular, the authors consider the implications of homebased working during and after the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of gender.FindingsThe authors identify key challenges in relation to flexibility, work intensification and socio-economic differences. Consideration of these areas highlights the potential pitfalls and challenges that are likely to persist as many organisations begin to plan for an increase in homebased working.Originality/valueThe authors argue that some commentators have been too quick to celebrate the apparent successes of the sudden, unplanned move to intensive homebased working. Important differences in occupation, gender and other socio-economic factors will have important implications for the experience of homebased working for many workers and their co-residents.","Mallett, Oliver Marks Abigail Skountridaki Lila",Gender in Management,,288

The impact of COVID-19 on liver-transplant recipients is unclear. Thus, it is currently unknown whether liver-transplant recipients are at a higher risk of developing complications related to COVID-19. Here, we report the case of liver-transplant recipients who were infected with SARS-CoV-2. A 20-year-old man who had undergone living-donor liver transplantation from his father at 5 years of age because of congenital biliary atresia was referred to our hospital for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Chest computed tomography did not show any abnormalities; however, laboratory results revealed liver dysfunction. He received tacrolimus as maintenance therapy that was continued at the same dose. He has not developed severe pulmonary disease and was discharged after 10 days of hospitalization. Limited data are available on post-transplant patients with COVID-19, and this case of a young patient without metabolic comorbidities did not show any association of severe COVID-19 under tacrolimus treatment. The progression of COVID-19 in liver-transplant recipients is complex, and COVID-19 risk should be evaluated in each patient until the establishment of optimal guidelines.","Hayashi, Kazuhiko; Ito, Yuki; Yamane, Ryosuke; Yoshizaki, Michiyo; Matsushita, Komei; Kajikawa, Go; Kozawa, Takashi; Mizutani, Taro; Shimizu, Yuko; Nagano, Kenichi; Tachi, Kosuke; Yoshioka, Kentaro; Goto, Hidemi",Clinical j. gastroenterology (Online),,288

These compounds reach wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) through sewerage system and are not sufficiently removed by using conventional treatment process. Psychiatric drugs released with WWTP effluent may cause possible risks to the receiving aquatic environment. Also, two antidepressants have been included in the ""watch list"" in 2020. Therefore, simple and relatively cost effective removal of psychiatric drugs from wastewaters becomes important. Magnetite red mud nanoparticles (RM-NPs) synthesized was applied for the removal of psychiatric drugs (fluoxetine, paroxetine, carbamazepine, diazepam, and lorazepam) in WWTP effluent first time in this study. The adsorption of carbamazepine as a model compound was fitted well with pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The Freundlich isotherm model better represented the sorption data than the Langmuir model. High adsorption capacity (90.5 mg/g) was reached at 30 min contact time at pH 6.5-7.0 at 25 °C. The adsorption rate was described by the pseudo second order model and its rate control mechanism was controlled by film diffusion. The magnetite RM-NPs were efficiently used for the removal of carbamazepine from real WWTP effluents. The adsorption capacity and the magnetic separability of the regenerated magnetite RM-NPs were unaffected five cycles. Due to its simple application, low cost and high adsorption capacity, magnetite RM-NPs can be recommended as a better adsorbent comparing to commercial adsorbents to remove psychiatric drugs from WWTP effluents.","Aydin, Senar; Bedük, Fatma; Ulvi, Arzu; Aydin, Mehmet Emin",Sci Total Environ,,288

However, associations between actual policies and temporal behavior changes have remained underexplored. To fill this important research gap, a nationwide retrospective life-oriented panel survey on individuals' behavior changes from April to September 2020 was implemented in Japan. Reliability of information sources, risk perceptions, and attitudes toward policymaking were also investigated. Valid data were collected from 2643 respondents residing in different parts of the country. Risks were reported about general infections and public transport use. Attitudes toward policymaking were mainly about policymaking capacity and PASS-LASTING based policy measures. A dynamic structural equation model (DSEM) was developed to quantify dynamic associations between individuals’ behavior changes over time and subjective assessments (i.e., attitudes) of policymaking. Survey results revealed that behavior changes are mostly characterized by avoidance behaviors. Modeling estimation results showed a statistically-significant sequential cause-effect relationship between accumulated behavior changes in the past, subjective factors, and the most recent behavior changes. The most recent behavior changes are mostly affected by accumulated behavior changes in the past. Effects of subjective assessments of policymaking on the most recent behavior changes are significant but moderate. Among attitudes toward policymaking, attitudes toward policymaking capacity are more influential than willingness to follow PASS-LASTING based policy measures. High risks of using public transport are found to significantly influence the most recent behavior changes, together with other risk perception factors. Insights into effective COVID-19 policymaking are summarized.","Ding, Hongxiang Zhang Junyi",Transport Policy,,288

522886,Hypertriglyceridemia in Sars-Cov-2 infected patients treated with parenteral nutrition,2020,"The scientific community is focused on developing antiviral therapies to mitigate the impacts of the ongoing novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. This will be facilitated by improved understanding of viral dynamics within infected hosts. Here, using a mathematical model in combination with published viral load data, we compare within-host viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 with analogous dynamics of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Our quantitative analyses using a mathematical model revealed that the within-host reproduction number at symptom onset of SARS-CoV-2 was statistically significantly larger than that of MERS-CoV and similar to that of SARS-CoV. In addition, the time from symptom onset to the viral load peak for SARS-CoV-2 infection was shorter than those of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. These findings suggest the difficulty of controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection by antivirals. We further used the viral dynamics model to predict the efficacy of potential antiviral drugs that have different modes of action. The efficacy was measured by the reduction in the viral load area under the curve (AUC). Our results indicate that therapies that block de novo infection or virus production are likely to be effective if and only if initiated before the viral load peak (which appears 2-3 days after symptom onset), but therapies that promote cytotoxicity of infected cells are likely to have effects with less sensitivity to the timing of treatment initiation. Furthermore, combining a therapy that promotes cytotoxicity and one that blocks de novo infection or virus production synergistically reduces the AUC with early treatment. Our unique modeling approach provides insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and may be useful for development of antiviral therapies.","Kim, Kwang Su; Ejima, Keisuke; Iwanami, Shoya; Fujita, Yasuhisa; Ohashi, Hirofumi; Koizumi, Yoshiki; Asai, Yusuke; Nakaoka, Shinji; Watashi, Koichi; Aihara, Kazuyuki; Thompson, Robin N; Ke, Ruian; Perelson, Alan S; Iwami, Shingo",PLoS Biol,,288

The current study was conducted to evaluate the effect of media on raising the level of health awareness of Saudi Arabian populations regarding the medical misinformation about the use of natural remedies against COVID-19. METHODS: This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted anonymously in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia between May 1st and June 30, 2020. The sample size was calculated using version-3.0 of OpenEpi. An 11-item questionnaire was designed to assess the effect of media on raising the level of health awareness of the population regarding the medical misinformation about the use of natural remedies during this pandemic. RESULTS: Among 1300 participants, nearly half (55.4%) reported having watched the Saudi Ministry of Health’s (MOH) broadcasted awareness videos. Social media (78.9%) was the main media platform on which they accessed these videos, followed by television (14.9%), and the Internet (6.2%). The MOH’s awareness videos had a positive effect on 69.5% of participants, who reported a change in their attitudes toward natural remedies and discontinuing the use of them as preventive medicine. The most discontinued natural remedies after watching the awareness videos were gargling with salt water (32.1%), followed by myrrh (17.6%), and garlic (12.9%). Positive effects were greater among participants with a low than high education level. CONCLUSION: The findings of the current study indicate that the Saudi MOH’s usage of social media channels has had a positive effect on the level of public health awareness concerning the reliability of natural remedies used during the pandemic. However, more research is needed to validate how social media networks can be used in a cross-cultural context to enhance health awareness and adaptation to healthy behaviors.","Alotiby, Amna",Int J Gen Med,https://doi.org/10.2147/ijgm.s317348; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34239323/,288
592622,"Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies in HIV-Infected Patients in Rome, Italy during the COVID-19 Outbreak",2021-06-24,"(1) Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically and rapidly changed the overall picture of healthcare in the way how doctors care for their patients. Due to the significant strain on hospitals and medical facilities, the popularity of web-based medical consultation has drawn the focus of researchers during the deadly coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the United States. Healthcare organizations are now reacting to COVID-19 by rapidly adopting new tools and innovations such as e-consultation platforms, which refer to the delivery of healthcare services digitally or remotely using digital technology to treat patients. However, patients’ utilization of different signal transmission mechanisms to seek medical advice through e-consultation websites has not been discussed during the pandemic. This paper examines the impact of different online signals (online reputation and online effort), offline signals (offline reputation) and disease risk on patients’ physician selection choice for e-consultation during the COVID-19 crisis. (2) Methods: Drawing on signaling theory, a theoretical model was developed to explore the antecedents of patients’ e-consultation choice toward a specific physician. The model was tested using 3-times panel data sets, covering 4231 physicians on Healthgrades and Vitals websites during the pandemic months of January, March and May 2020. (3) Results: The findings suggested that online reputation, online effort and disease risk were positively related to patients’ online physician selection. The disease risk has also affected patients’ e-consultation choice. A high-risk disease positively moderates the relationship between online reputation and patients’ e-consultation choice, which means market signals (online reputation) are more influential than seller signals (offline reputation and online effort). Hence, market signals strengthened the effect in the case of high-risk disease. (4) Conclusions: The findings of this study provide practical suggestions for physicians, platform developers and policymakers in online environments to improve their service quality during the crisis. This article offers a practical guide on using emerging technology to provide virtual care during the pandemic. This study also provides implications for government officials and doctors on the potentials of consolidating virtual care solutions in the near future in order to contribute to the integration of emerging technology into healthcare.","Shah, Adnan Muhammad; Naqvi, Rizwan Ali; Jeong, Ok-Ran",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34068291/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18105192,288

593568,"Insights into Potential Mechanisms of Injury and Treatment Targets in COVID-19, SARS-Cov-2 Infection",2020-06-08,"BACKGROUND: Planning for extreme surges in demand for hospital care of patients requiring urgent life-saving treatment for COVID-19, while retaining capacity for other emergency conditions, is one of the most challenging tasks faced by health care providers and policymakers during the pandemic. Health systems must be well-prepared to cope with large and sudden changes in demand by implementing interventions to ensure adequate access to care. We developed the first planning tool for the COVID-19 pandemic to account for how hospital provision interventions (such as cancelling elective surgery, setting up field hospitals, or hiring retired staff) will affect the capacity of hospitals to provide life-saving care. METHODS: We conducted a review of interventions implemented or considered in 12 European countries in March to April 2020, an evaluation of their impact on capacity, and a review of key parameters in the care of COVID-19 patients. This information was used to develop a planner capable of estimating the impact of specific interventions on doctors, nurses, beds, and respiratory support equipment. We applied this to a scenario-based case study of 1 intervention, the set-up of field hospitals in England, under varying levels of COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: The Abdul Latif Jameel Institute for Disease and Emergency Analytics pandemic planner is a hospital planning tool that allows hospital administrators, policymakers, and other decision-makers to calculate the amount of capacity in terms of beds, staff, and crucial medical equipment obtained by implementing the interventions. Flexible assumptions on baseline capacity, the number of hospitalizations, staff-to-beds ratios, and staff absences due to COVID-19 make the planner adaptable to multiple settings. The results of the case study show that while field hospitals alleviate the burden on the number of beds available, this intervention is futile unless the deficit of critical care nurses is addressed first. DISCUSSION: The tool supports decision-makers in delivering a fast and effective response to the pandemic. The unique contribution of the planner is that it allows users to compare the impact of interventions that change some or all inputs.","Christen, Paula; D’Aeth, Josh C.; Løchen, Alessandra; McCabe, Ruth; Rizmie, Dheeya; Schmit, Nora; Nayagam, Shevanthi; Miraldo, Marisa; Aylin, Paul; Bottle, Alex; Perez-Guzman, Pablo N.; Donnelly, Christl A.; Ghani, Azra C.; Ferguson, Neil M.; White, Peter J.; Hauck, Katharina",Med Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33480661/; https://doi.org/10.1097/mlr.0000000000001502,288

But does knowledge change behavior? We test whether coronavirus health knowledge promotes protective risk mitigation behaviors early in the Covid-19 pandemic in samples from four African countries (Ghana, Malawi, Sierra Leone, and Tanzania). Despite reputations for weak health sectors and low average levels of education, health knowledge of the symptoms and transmission mechanisms was high in all countries in the two months after the virus entered the country. Higher knowledge was associated with increased protective measures that would likely lower disease risk with one exception–knowledge was inversely correlated with social distancing. Respondents largely adhered to mask mandates and lockdowns, but continued coming into contact with others at small, informal gatherings, gatherings not affected by mandates. Knowledge alone did not reduce all risky activities, especially gatherings within other people’s homes. Even early in the pandemic, income loss or stress were commonly reported. Our results suggest that early and consistent government provision of health information, likely reduced the severity of the pandemic in Africa but was not a panacea.","Fitzpatrick, Anne; Beg, Sabrin; Derksen, Laura; Karing, Anne; Kerwin, Jason; Lucas, Adrienne M.; Reynoso, Natalia Ordaz; Squires, Munir",J Econ Behav Organ,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167268121002869; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34305214/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167268121002869?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jebo.2021.06.045,288

We hypothesise that at 6 months, targeted strengthening physiotherapist-led treatment will be associated with greater improvements in hip-related QOL or greater patient-perceived global improvement when compared with standardised stretching physiotherapist-led treatment. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will recruit 164 participants with FAI syndrome who will be randomised into one of the two intervention groups, both receiving one-on-one treatment with the physiotherapist over 6 months. The targeted strengthening physiotherapist-led treatment group will receive a personalised exercise therapy and education programme. The standardised stretching physiotherapist-led treatment group will receive standardised stretching and personalised education programme. Primary outcomes are change in hip-related QOL using International Hip Outcome Tool-33 and patient-perceived global improvement. Secondary outcomes include cost-effectiveness, muscle strength, range of motion, functional task performance, biomechanics, hip cartilage structure and physical activity levels. Statistical analyses will make comparisons between both treatment groups by intention to treat, with all randomised participants included in analyses, regardless of protocol adherence. Linear mixed models (with baseline value as a covariate and treatment condition as a fixed factor) will be used to evaluate the treatment effect and 95% CI at primary end-point (6 months).

Hence, applying preventive measures is the most critical intervention to control the infection. Pregnant women are particularly susceptible to respiratory pathogens because of their immunosuppressive state and physiological adaptive change during pregnancy. Therefore, this study was aimed to assess knowledge and practice to prevent coronavirus disease and its associated factors among pregnant women in Debre Tabor Town. METHODS: Community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 422 participants from May 25–June 15, 2020. A simple random sampling technique was employed. Data were collected by face-to-face interview using a structured and pre-tested questionnaire and analysis using SPSS version 23. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis was carried out and p-value < 0.05 at 95% CI were considered as statistically significant. RESULTS: Overall 46.8 and 47.6% of women were knowledgeable and had good practice to prevent coronavirus respectively. Women’s age (15–24 years) (AOR = 4.85, 95% CI: 1.34–5.42), educational status (AOR:3.70; 95% CI: 1.16–5.40) being civil servant (AOR:2.84; 95% CI: 1.55–5.21), wanted pregnancy (AOR:3.37; 95% CI: 1.20–9.45), antenatal care follow-up (AOR:2.07; 95% CI: 1.03–4.13) were significantly associated with COVID-19 knowledge, whereas educational status (AOR:3.78; 95% CI: 1.19–5.11), number of children (AOR:2.89; 95% CI: 1.29–6.45) and knowledge (AOR:8.42;95% CI: 4.50–15.85), were also found to be statistically significant with practice. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the participants had poor knowledge and inappropriate practice. Increasing health education programs via different media, coordinated and combined efforts of authorities and all individuals will be needed to battles the spread of the infection.

Lack of data underlying how the human host interacts with SARS-CoV-2 virus. In the current study, We performed Venn-analysis, Gene ontology (GO), KEGG pathway analysis and Protein-protein interaction analysis of whole transcriptome studies with the aim of clarifying the genes and pathways potentially altered during human respiratory tract cells infected with SARS-CoV-2. We selected four studies through a systematic search of the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database or published article about SARS-CoV-2 infection in different types of respiratory tract cells. We found 36 overlapping upregulated genes among different types of cells after viral infection. Further functional enrichment analysis revealed these DEGs are most likely involved in biological processes related to inflammatory response and response to cytokine, cell component related to extracellular space and I-kappaB/NF-kappaB complex, molecular function related to protein binding and cytokine activity. KEGG pathways analysis highlighted altered conical and casual pathways related to TNF, NF-kappa B, Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and IL17 signaling pathways during SARS-CoV-2 infection with CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, CXCL8, CXCL10, IL32, CX3CL1, CCL20, IRF1, NFKB2 and NFKB1A up-regulated which may explain the inflammatory cytokine storms associated with severe cases of COVID-19.","Yang, Minghui; Lei, Luping; Cao, Qiumei; Yang, Yang; Wang, Jun; Jiang, Xiao; Huang, Kun; Lai, Jinzhi; Qing, Ling; Wang, Yu; Liu, Yingxia",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.15.383927,288

A recent study of patients in China discovered an association between ABO blood type and SARS-CoV-2 infection status by comparing COVID-19 patients with the general population. Whether blood type is associated with increased COVID-19 morbidity or mortality remains unknown. We used observational healthcare data on 1559 individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2 (682 COV+) with known blood type in the New York Presbyterian (NYP) hospital system to assess the association between ABO+Rh blood type and SARS-CoV-2 infection status, intubation, and death. We found a higher proportion of blood group A and a lower proportion of blood group O among COV+ patients compared to COV−, though in both cases the result is significant only in Rh positive blood types. We show that the effect of blood type is not explained by risk factors we considered (age, sex, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, overweight status, and chronic cardiovascular and lung disorders). In a meta-analysis of NYP data with previously-reported data from China, we find enrichment for A and B and depletion of O blood groups among COVID-19 patients compared to the general population. Our data do not provide strong evidence of associations between blood group and intubation or death among COVID-19 patients. In this preliminary observational study of data currently being collected during the outbreak, we find new evidence of associations between B, AB, and Rh blood groups and COVID-19 and further evidence of recently-discovered associations between A and O blood groups and COVID-19.","Zietz, Michael; Tatonetti, Nicholas P.",medRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.08.20058073; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32511586/,288

Methods: By reinterpreting the data in the article ""Diagnostic Value of Combined Detection of Serum 2019 novel coronavirus IgM and IgG Antibodies in novel coronavirusin Infection"", the positive likelihood ratio of IgM and IgG antibody in diagnosis of COVID-19 (nucleic acid positive patients) was calculated, and the posterior probability of IgM and IgG antibodies and their tandem detection to diagnose was finally calculated. Results: The positive likelihood ratios of single IgM and IgG antibody were 18.50 and 12.65 respectively, and the posterior probabilities were 90.18% and 86.26% respectively. However, the posterior probability of the two antibodies tandem detection is 99.15%, which can give clinicians quantitative confidence in the diagnosis of COVID-19 from suspected cases. According to the results of this study, combining the advantages and disadvantages of nucleic acid detection and antibody detection, the clinical pathway for clinicians to diagnose COVID-19 is found. Conclusion: For suspected cases, IgM and IgG antibody tests should be firstly done at the same time. If the antibody tests are all positive, COVID-19 can be confirmed. If not, nucleic acid detection (one or more times) is performed, and in extreme cases, high-throughput viral genome sequencing is performed.","Yangchun, F.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.07.20053660v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.07.20053660,288

We integrated a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) dataset with a peripheral blood mononuclear cell dataset (PBMC) and analyzed the combined cell population, focusing on genes associated with disease severity. Distinct cell populations were detected in both BAL and PBMC where the immunomodulatory long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) NEAT1 and MALAT1 were highly differentially expressed between mild and severe patients. The detection of other severity associated genes involved in cellular stress response and apoptosis regulation suggests that the pro-inflammatory functions of these lncRNAs may foster cell stress and damage.

Structural stressors, including extended work hours, redeployment, and changes in organizational mandates, often intersect with interpersonal and personal stressors, such as caring for those with COVID-19 infections; worrying about infection of self, family, and loved ones; working despite shortages of personal protective equipment; and encountering various difficult moral-ethical dilemmas. OBJECTIVE: The paper describes the protocol for a longitudinal study seeking to capture the unique experiences, challenges, and changes faced by HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study seeks to explore the impact of COVID-19 on the mental well-being of HCWs with a particular focus on moral distress, perceptions of and satisfaction with delivery of care, and how changes in work structure are tolerated among HCWs providing clinical services. METHODS: A prospective longitudinal design is employed to assess HCWs' experiences across domains of mental health (depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress, and well-being), moral distress and moral reasoning, work-related changes and telehealth, organizational responses to COVID-19 concerns, and experiences with COVID-19 infections to self and to others. We recruited HCWs from across Canada through convenience snowball sampling to participate in either a short-form or long-form web-based survey at baseline. Respondents to the baseline survey are invited to complete a follow-up survey every 3 months, for a total of 18 months. RESULTS: A total of 1926 participants completed baseline surveys between June 26 and December 31, 2020, and 1859 participants provided their emails to contact them to participate in follow-up surveys. As of July 2021, data collection is ongoing, with participants nearing the 6- or 9-month follow-up periods depending on their initial time of self-enrollment. CONCLUSIONS: This protocol describes a study that will provide unique insights into the immediate and longitudinal impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the dimensions of mental health, moral distress, health care delivery, and workplace environment of HCWs. The feasibility and acceptability of implementing a short-form and long-form survey on participant engagement and data retention will also be discussed.

This study aims to identify possible factors causing delay and losing precious time during diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 at home and health facility level. It also aims to highlight perceptions and experiences of family members of deceased regarding diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 infection in hospital. METHODS: A retrospective study was done to review COVID-19 deaths from 18(th) March to 5(th) June 2020 in Punjab, India. A total of 48 laboratory confirmed (RT-PCR) COVID-19 deaths were reported during this period. Socio demographic profile, sequence of events including clinical symptoms, medical aid taken, time of confirmation of diagnosis and treatment before death were noted from the records on a predesigned proforma. Family members of deceased were also interviewed and asked open-ended questions regarding their experiences at various health facilities. Descriptive statistics was presented in percentages, mean, and median. RESULTS: Mean age of subjects was 56.3 ± 18.3 years. Majority (82.2%) had three or more than three comorbidities. Median time from appearance of first symptom to first medical contact and confirmation of diagnosis was 1 and 5 days, respectively. On the basis of interview with deceased's relative, various themes like delay in diagnosis and treatment, dissatisfied with hospital system and lack of communication between relative and patient were generated. CONCLUSION: Presence of comorbidities was the most important risk factor. Health seeking behavior of patients immediately after appearance of symptoms was found to be satisfactory.","Chaudhary, Anurag; Bansal, Priya; Gupta, Vikram K.; Satija, Mahesh; Girdhar, Sangeeta; Sharma, Sarit; Mohan, Bishav; Sharma, Pranjl; Kaur, Prabhleen; Bansal, Aman",J Family Med Prim Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33532415/; https://doi.org/10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_1411_20,288

The clinical characteristics are high fever, rapidly progressive diffuse pneumonitis and respiratory distress. It is highly infectious through intimate contact or direct contact with infectious body fluids. Outbreaks within communities and hospitals have been reported. Development of rapid and reliable diagnostic tools is urgently needed. We developed an immunoglobulin G (IgG) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), using whole virus antigen of SARS-CoV. Eighty-six serum samples collected from patients who were hospitalized for other causes were examined to determine the cut-off O.D. value. The cut-off O.D. value was defined as 0.175 by calculating the mean O.D. value of the 86 sera plus 3 standard deviations. To determine the sensitivity and specificity of the ELISA, 56 positive sera and 204 negative sera were tested. The sensitivity was 96.4% and the specificity was 100%.

608270,Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis after SARS-CoV-2 infection,2020-06-01,"Effective communication between members of the multidisciplinary team is imperative for patient safety. Within the Medicine for the Elderly wards at Royal Victoria Hospital (RVH) in Dundee, we identified an inefficient process of information-sharing between the orthopaedics outpatient department (OPD) at the main teaching hospital and our hospital’s rehabilitation teams, and sought to improve this by introducing several changes to the work system. Our aim was for all patients who attended the OPD clinic to have a plan communicated to the RVH team within 24 hours. Before our intervention, clinic letters containing important instructions for ongoing rehabilitation were dictated by the OPD team, transcribed and uploaded to an electronic system before the RVH team could access them. We analysed clinic attendances over a 4-week period and found that it took 15 days on average for letters to be shared with the RVH teams. We worked with both teams to develop a clinical communication tool and new processes, aiming to expedite the sharing of key information. Patients attended the OPD with this form, the clinician completed it at the time of their appointment and the form returned with the patient to RVH on the same day. We completed multiple Plan–Do–Study–Act cycles; before our project was curtailed by the COVID-19 pandemic. During our study period, seven patients attended the OPD with a form, with all seven returning to RVH with a completed treatment plan documented by the OPD clinician. This allowed rehabilitation teams to have access to clinic instructions generated by orthopaedic surgeons almost immediately after a patient attended the clinic, essentially eliminating the delay in information-sharing. The introduction of a simple communication tool and processes to ensure reliable transfer of information can expedite information-sharing between secondary care teams and can potentially reduce delays in rehabilitation.","Testrow, Sean; McGovern, Ryan; Tully, Vicki",BMJ Open Qual,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33579746/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjoq-2020-001274,288

Here, we introduce a method based on Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) for prediction of antigens presented on the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) encoded by HLA genes—RBM-MHC. RBM-MHC can be trained on custom and newly available samples with no or a small amount of HLA annotations. RBM-MHC ensures improved predictions for rare alleles and matches state-of-the-art performance for well-characterized alleles while being less data demanding. RBM-MHC is shown to be a flexible and easily interpretable method that can be used as a predictor of cancer neoantigens and viral epitopes, as a tool for feature discovery, and to reconstruct peptide motifs presented on specific HLA molecules.","Bravi, Barbara; Tubiana, Jérôme; Cocco, Simona; Monasson, Rémi; Mora, Thierry; Walczak, Aleksandra M.",Cell Syst,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33338400/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2020.11.005,288

Methods: A total of 631 young adults (38.8% males) participated in the cross-sectional study and completed an online survey that included five components: general information, COVID-19 related issues, PA, SB, and sleep. For longitudinal study, PA, SB, and sleep data collected from 70 participants before and during COVID-19 pandemic were analyzed. Results: Participants reported engaging in low PA, high SB and long sleep duration during COVID-19 pandemic. Females had greater concern for COVID-19 related issues and engaged in more prevention strategies than males. Moreover, a significant decline in PA while increase in both times spent in SB and sleep were determined after COVID-19 outbreak.

This cross-sectional study included 1218 nursing personnel at a public hospital in Brazil. Structural equation modelling was performed. The sample comprised mostly women (85.4%), and the mean age was 44.1 (SD = 11.3; range: 24–70) years. Prevalence of presenteeism was 32.8%. Among presenteeist workers (n = 400), a relationship was observed between presenteeism and higher CMD scores. Furthermore, being able to concentrate on work even with a health problem mediated the relationship between social support and CMD and between psychological demands and CMD. Working when sick impairs both the work and the worker’s health.

However, such means may pose confidentiality issues and legal problems. To correct this situation, a platform of teleconsultation services provided by pharmacists, titled “Ask Your Pharmacist,” was created in Quebec, Canada. METHODS: A web-based satisfaction survey was carried out among patients and pharmacists who have used the Ask Your Pharmacist platform to describe their experience and satisfaction with the platform and explore the perceived usefulness of this service in the province of Quebec. RESULTS: A total of 53 patients and 27 pharmacists completed the survey. Most patients were satisfied or very satisfied with their experience with Ask Your Pharmacist (96.2%), said that it met their need (88.7%), and agreed they would not have to consult again about the matter discussed with the pharmacist (75.5%). The main motivation of pharmacists for volunteering on Ask Your Pharmacist was to meet the needs of patients (85.1%), promote their profession (55.6%), improve drug utilization in the population (55.6%) and increase accessibility to a pharmacist (51.9%). Most (81.5%) felt that providing written consultation (rather than oral) required more research on their part. DISCUSSION: Most patients judged they would not have to have another consultation about the matter discussed with the pharmacist, suggesting that Ask Your Pharmacist may avoid the need for physician and emergency department visits.

However, little is known about the effects of pre‐admission and/or in‐hospital antihypertension treatments on clinical outcomes. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the association between in‐hospital blood pressure (BP) control and COVID‐19–related outcomes and to compare the effects of different antihypertension treatments. This study included 2864 COVID‐19 patients and 1628 were hypertensive. Patients were grouped according to their BP during hospitalization and records of medication application. Patients with higher BP showed worse cardiac and renal functions and clinical outcomes. After adjustment, subjects with pre‐admission usage of renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors (HR = 0.35, 95%CI 0.14‐0.86, P = .022) had a lower risk of adverse clinical outcomes, including death, acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, septic shock, mechanical ventilation, and intensive care unit admission. Particularly, hypertension patients receiving RAAS inhibitor treatment either before (HR = 0.35, 95%CI 0.13‐0.97, P = .043) or after (HR = 0.18, 95%CI 0.04‐0.86, P = .031) admission showed a significantly lower risk of adverse clinical outcomes than those receiving application of other antihypertensive medicines. Furthermore, consecutive application of RAAS inhibitors in COVID‐19 patients with hypertension showed better clinical outcomes (HR = 0.10, 95%CI 0.01‐0.83, P = .033) than non‐RAAS inhibitors users. We revealed that COVID‐19 patients with poor BP control during hospitalization had worse clinical outcomes. Compared with other antihypertension medicines, RAAS inhibitors were beneficial for improving clinical outcomes in COVID‐19 patients with hypertension. Our findings provide direct evidence to support the administration of RAAS inhibitors to COVID‐19 patients with hypertension before and after admission.","Chen, Renzheng; Yang, Jie; Gao, Xubin; Ding, Xiaohan; Yang, Yuanqi; Shen, Yang; He, Chunyan; Xiang, Hedong; Ke, Jingbin; Yuan, Fangzhengyuan; Cheng, Ran; Lv, Hailin; Li, Ping; Zhang, Limin; Liu, Chuan; Tan, Hu; Huang, Lan",J Clin Hypertens (Greenwich),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33006442/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jch.14038,288

The reactivity of S-A5D5 with purified N195 protein and utilization of the MAb as a detector antibody to develop an antigen capture ELISA was assessed. As little as 37.5 pg of purified N protein and 50 TCID(50) of SARS CoV could be detected by the antigen capture ELISA. Specific binding of the MAb S-A5D5 to both purified N195 and SARS CoV nucleocapsid antigen was effectively inhibited by human SARS positive serum and guinea pig anti-N195 serum. The N protein in N195-spike recombinant baculovirus-infected Sf-9 cells could also be identified. N protein was detected in 18 IFA IgM-positive serum samples collected from SARS confirmed patients, but not in nine samples collected from SARS recovery patient.

In order for patients to continue to benefit from CR, programs need to rapidly adapt to the current environment. This review highlights ways CR has evolved, and reviews the history of CR and recent advancements in telemedicine including remote patient monitoring, and mobile health that can be applied to CR. RECENT FINDINGS: Despite that initial studies indicate that home-based CR (HBCR) is safe and effective, HBCR has faced several challenges that have prevented it from becoming more widely implemented. Many previous concerns can now be addressed through the use of new innovations in home-based healthcare delivery. SUMMARY: Since its inception, CR has become increasingly recognized as an important tool to improve patient mortality and quality of life in a broad range of cardiac diseases.

While infection initiates in the proximal airways, severe and sometimes fatal symptoms of the disease are caused by infection of the alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells of the distal lung and associated inflammation. In this study we develop primary human lung epithelial infection models to understand initial responses of proximal and distal lung epithelium to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Differentiated air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures of proximal airway epithelium and alveosphere cultures of distal lung AT2 cells are readily infected by SARS-CoV-2, leading to an epithelial cell-autonomous proinflammatory response with increased expression of interferon signaling genes. Studies to validate the efficacy of selected candidate COVID-19 drugs confirm that Remdesivir strongly suppresses viral infection/replication.

The virus spike glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins are the main targets for the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs, to control the disease spread. We herein study the structural order-disorder propensity and the rates of evolution of these two proteins to characterize their B cell and T cell epitopes, previously suggested to contribute to immune response caused by SARS-CoV-2 infections. We first analyzed the rates of evolution along the sequences of spike and nucleocapsid proteins in relation to the spatial locations of their epitopes. For this purpose, we compared orthologs from seven human coronaviruses: SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1. We then focus on the local, structural order-disorder propensities of the protein regions where the SARS-CoV-2 epitopes are located. We show that the vast majority of nucleocapsid protein epitopes overlap the RNA-binding and dimerization domains and some of them are characterized by low rates of evolutions. Similarly, spike protein epitopes are preferentially located in regions that are predicted to be ordered and well-conserved, in correspondence of the heptad repeats 1 and 2. Interestingly, both the receptor-binding motif to ACE2 and the fusion peptide of spike protein are characterized by high rates of evolution, probably to overcome host immunity. In conclusion, our results provide evidence for conserved epitopes that may help to develop long-lasting, broad-spectrum SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.","Forcelloni, Sergio; Benedetti, Anna; Dilucca, Maddalena; Giansanti, Andrea",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.14.095133,288

Recently, African fruit bats with populations that roost in or near urban areas have been shown to harbour a great diversity of paramyxoviruses, posing potential spillover risks to public health. Understanding the circulation of these viruses in their reservoir populations is essential to predict and prevent future emerging diseases. Here, we identify a high incidence of multiple paramyxoviruses in urine samples collected from a closed captive colony of circa 115 straw-coloured fruit bats (Eidolon helvum). The sequences detected have high nucleotide identities with those derived from free ranging African fruit bats and form phylogenetic clusters with the Henipavirus genus, Pararubulavirus genus and other unclassified paramyxoviruses. As this colony had been closed for 5 years prior to this study, these results indicate that within-host paramyxoviral persistence underlies the role of bats as reservoirs of these viruses.","Gibson, Louise; Ribas, Maria Puig; Kemp, James; Restif, Olivier; Suu-Ire, Richard D.; Wood, James L.

BACKGROUND: Due to governmental stay‐at‐home orders during the pandemic, families with “dislocated” (compelled to return home) college students would likely encounter unique stressors while also being limited in their normal ways of coping. METHODS: Using an online survey, the current study sought to discover how diverse individual characteristics and family living situations of 323 dislocated students associated with varying homelife experiences (e.g., intrusive parenting, students making an extra effort to spend time with family), and how such experiences associated with relationship changes during the quarantine. RESULTS: Analyses detected some differences in the students' homelife experiences based on background and living situations, especially related to being a first‐year student, having been excited about returning home, and feeling accepted by parents about being home. Negative family relationship quality during the quarantine was most predicted by negative attitudes from students and parents about students being home, the student feeling less adultlike (based on treatment and own identity conception), and having low autonomy. CONCLUSION: Returning home for quarantine was challenging for most students, and circumstances and attitudes appeared to contribute to how such challenges associated with family relationship changes. IMPLICATIONS: Implications for practitioners and universities are discussed in regard to preparing college students and their families for similar conditions.","Hall, Scott S.; Zygmunt, Eva",Fam Relat,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34149136/; https://doi.org/10.1111/fare.12544,288

Mechanisms of the physical interactions between fungi and bacteria have been studied in both clinical and agricultural settings, as discussed in this review. Fungi and bacteria that are a part of these dynamic interactions can have altered growth and development as well as changes in microbial fitness as it pertains to antibiotic resistance, nutrient acquisition, and microbial dispersal. Consequences of these interactions are not just limited to the respective microorganisms, but also have major impacts in the health of humans and plants alike. Examining the mechanisms behind the physical interactions of fungi and bacteria will provide us with an understanding of multi-kingdom community processes and allow for the development of therapeutic approaches for disease in both ecological settings.","Steffan, Breanne N.; Venkatesh, Nandhitha; Keller, Nancy P.",J Fungi (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33114069/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jof6040243,288

Recently, a new COVID-19 phenotype has been noted in patients after they have ostensibly recovered from acute COVID-19 symptoms. This new syndrome is commonly termed Long COVID/Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). Here we refer to it as Long COVID/PASC. Lingering symptoms persist for as much as 6 months (or longer) after acute infection, where COVID-19 survivors complain of recurring fatigue or muscle weakness, being out of breath, sleep difficulties, and anxiety or depression. Given that blood clots can block microcapillaries and thereby inhibit oxygen exchange, we here investigate if the lingering symptoms that individuals with Long COVID/PASC manifest might be due to the presence of persistent circulating plasma microclots that are resistant to fibrinolysis. METHODS: We use techniques including proteomics and fluorescence microscopy to study plasma samples from healthy individuals, individuals with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), with acute COVID-19, and those with Long COVID/PASC symptoms. RESULTS: We show that plasma samples from Long COVID/PASC still contain large anomalous (amyloid) deposits (microclots). We also show that these microclots in both acute COVID-19 and Long COVID/PASC plasma samples are resistant to fibrinolysis (compared to plasma from controls and T2DM), even after trypsinisation. After a second trypsinization, the persistent pellet deposits (microclots) were solubilized. We detected various inflammatory molecules that are substantially increased in both the supernatant and trapped in the solubilized pellet deposits of acute COVID-19 and Long COVID/PASC, versus the equivalent volume of fully digested fluid of the control samples and T2DM. Of particular interest was a substantial increase in α(2)-antiplasmin (α2AP), various fibrinogen chains, as well as Serum Amyloid A (SAA) that were trapped in the solubilized fibrinolytic-resistant pellet deposits. CONCLUSIONS: Clotting pathologies in both acute COVID-19 infection and in Long COVID/PASC might benefit from following a regime of continued anticlotting therapy to support the fibrinolytic system function.","Pretorius, Etheresia; Vlok, Mare; Venter, Chantelle; Bezuidenhout, Johannes A.; Laubscher, Gert Jacobus; Steenkamp, Janami; Kell, Douglas B.",Cardiovasc Diabetol,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12933-021-01359-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34425843/,288

Drawing on uncertainty management theory (UMT), this study elucidates the communicative nature of crowdsourced medicine as a means by which COVID ""long-haulers"" respond to their poorly understood illness. METHODS 31,892 posts on the long-haulers subreddit (r/covidlonghaulers) were analyzed, starting with its creation date, July 24th, 2020, until January 7, 2021. The Meaning Extraction Method was used to identify clusters of words that mathematically group together across the text observations. RESULTS Analyses yielded 16 distinct factors of words, which we thematized based on their composition, the data, and UMT. The 16 themes encompassed symptoms (e.g., pain, respiratory, sensory), diagnostic concerns (testing, diagnosis), broad health concerns (immunity, physical activity, diet), chronicity, support, identity, and anxiety. CONCLUSION Findings provide a succinct, yet robust set of themes reflecting the information-seeking (i.e., ""This is happening to me"") and support-seeking functions of long-haulers' talk (i.e., ""Is this happening to you?""). Findings have implications for collective uncertainty management, online crowdsourcing, and patient advocacy.

We use the lens of ‘holding patients’ (drawing from attachment theory, psychology and from Australian Indigenous knowledge) to conceptualise cancer clinicians' processes of care and therapeutic relationships with patients. These notions of ‘holding’ resonate with the deep responsibility cancer care clinicians feel towards their patients. They enrich ethical language beyond duties to benefit, avoid harm, respect patients' autonomy and provide just treatment. We consider the disruptive effects of COVID‐19 on care delivery and on clinicians themselves. We then show how models of clinical ethics and other similar reflective discussion approaches are a relevant support mechanism to assist clinicians to process and make sense of COVID‐19's disruptions to their professional ethical role of holding patients during and beyond the pandemic.","Delany, Clare; Benhamu, Joanne; McDougall, Rosalind; Ko, Danielle; Jones, Hayley; Mileshkin, Linda; Largey, Geraldine; Clinch, Alex; Heynemann, Sarah",Intern Med J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34278682/; https://doi.org/10.1111/imj.15375,288

(2) What is the clinical effectiveness of tests that detect the presence of antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus to inform COVID-19 diagnosis? Design: systematic review and meta-analysis of studies of diagnostic test accuracy. We systematically searched for all published evidence on the effectiveness of tests for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus, or antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, up to 4 May 2020, and assessed relevant studies for risks of bias using the QUADAS-2 framework. Main outcome measures: measures of diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative predictive value) were the main outcomes of interest. We also included studies that reported influence of testing on subsequent patient management, and that reported virus/antibody detection rates where these facilitated comparisons of testing in different settings, different populations, or using different sampling methods. Results: 38 studies on SARS-CoV-2 virus testing and 25 studies on SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing were identified. We identified high or unclear risks of bias in the majority of studies, most commonly as a result of unclear methods of patient selection and test conduct, or because of the use of a reference standard that may not definitively diagnose COVID-19. The majority were in hospital settings, in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection. Pooled analysis of 16 studies (3818 patients) estimated a sensitivity of 87.8% (95% confidence interval 81.5% to 92.2%) for an initial reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test. For antibody tests, ten studies reported diagnostic accuracy outcomes: sensitivity ranged from 18.4% to 96.1% and specificity 88.9% to 100%. However, the lack of a true reference standard for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis makes it challenging to assess the true diagnostic accuracy of these tests. Eighteen studies reporting different sampling methods suggest that for virus tests, the type of sample obtained/type of tissue sampled could influence test accuracy. Finally we searched for, but did not identify, any evidence on how any test influences subsequent patient management. Conclusions: Evidence is rapidly emerging on the effectiveness of tests for COVID-19 diagnosis and management, but important uncertainties about their effectiveness and most appropriate application remain. Estimates of diagnostic accuracy should be interpreted bearing in mind the absence of a definitive reference standard to diagnose or rule out COVID-19 infection. More evidence is needed about the effectiveness of testing outside of hospital settings and in mild or asymptomatic cases. Implementation of public health strategies centred on COVID-19 testing provides opportunities to explore these important areas of research.","Jarrom, D.; Elston, L.; Washington, J.; Prettyjohns, M.; Cann, K.; Myles, S.; Groves, P.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.10.20171777; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.10.20171777v1?rss=1,288
617903,Outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Patients with Chronic Liver Disease and Cirrhosis: a N3C Study,2021-06-07,"PURPOSE: Physical activity (PA) represents the first line of defence against diseases characterised by increased inflammation status, such as metabolic and infectious diseases. Conversely, a sedentary lifestyle—associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disorders—negatively impacts on general health status, including susceptibility to infections. At a time of a pandemic SARS-CoV2 infection, and in the context of the multiorgan crosstalk (widely accepted as a mechanism participating in the pathophysiology of all organs and systems), we examine the complex interplay mediated by skeletal muscle contraction involving the immune system and how this contributes to control health status and to counteract viral infections. In so doing, we review the molecular mechanisms and expression of molecules modulated by PA, able to provide the proper molecular equipment against viral infections such as the current SARS-CoV2. METHODS: A critical review of the literature was performed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms and mediators induced by PA that potentially impact on viral infections such as SARS-CoV2. RESULTS: We showed the effects mediated by regular moderate PA on viral adverse effects through the regulation of biological processes involving the crosstalk between skeletal muscle, the immune system and adipose tissue. Evidence was provided of the effects mediated by modulation of the expression of inflammation markers. CONCLUSION: A tigth association between PA and reduction in inflammation status allows effective counteracting of SARS-CoV2 infection. It is therefore essential to persuade people to keep active.","Nigro, Ersilia; Polito, Rita; Alfieri, Andreina; Mancini, Annamaria; Imperlini, Esther; Elce, Ausilia; Krustrup, Peter; Orrù, Stefania; Buono, Pasqualina; Daniele, Aurora",Eur J Appl Physiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32885275/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00421-020-04484-5,288
618102,Impaired Humoral Immunity to SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination in Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma and CLL Patients,2021-06-03,"Diarrhea occurs in 2-50% of cases of COVID-19 (∼8% is average across series). The diarrhea does not appear to account for the disease mortality and its contribution to the morbidity has not been defined, even though it is a component of Long Covid or post-infectious aspects of the disease. Even less is known about the pathophysiologic mechanism of the diarrhea. To begin to understand the pathophysiology of COVID-19 diarrhea, we exposed human enteroid monolayers obtained from five healthy subjects and made from duodenum, jejunum, and proximal colon to live SARS-CoV-2 and virus like particles (VLPs) made from exosomes expressing SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins (Spike, Nucleocapsid, Membrane and Envelope). Results: 1) Live virus was exposed apically for 90 min, then washed out and studied 2 and 5 days later. SARS-Cov-2 was taken up by enteroids and live virus was present in lysates and in the apical>>basolateral media of polarized enteroids 48 h after exposure. This is the first demonstration of basolateral appearance of live virus after apical exposure. High vRNA concentration was detected in cell lysates and in the apical and basolateral media up to 5 days after exposure. 2) Two days after viral exposure, cytokine measurements of media showed significantly increased levels of IL-6, IL-8 and MCP-1. 3) Two days after viral exposure, mRNA levels of ACE2, NHE3 and DRA were reduced but there was no change in mRNA of CFTR. NHE3 protein was also decreased. 4) Live viral studies were mimicked by some studies with VLP exposure for 48 h. VLPs with Spike-D614G bound to the enteroid apical surface and was taken up; this resulted in decreased mRNA levels of ACE2, NHE3, DRA and CFTR. 4) VLP effects were determined on active anion secretion measured with the Ussing chamber/voltage clamp technique. S-D614G acutely exposed to apical surface of human ileal enteroids did not alter the short-circuit current (Isc). However, VLPS-D614G exposure to enteroids that were pretreated for ∼24 h with IL-6 plus IL-8 induced a concentration dependent increase in Isc indicating stimulated anion secretion, that was delayed in onset by ∼8 min. The anion secretion was inhibited by apical exposure to a specific calcium activated Cl channel (CaCC) inhibitor (AO1) but not by a specific CFTR inhibitor (BP027); was inhibited by basolateral exposure to the K channel inhibit clortimazole; and was prevented by pretreatment with the calcium buffer BAPTA-AM. 5) The calcium dependence of the VLP-induced increase in Isc was studied in Caco-2/BBe cells stably expressing the genetically encoded Ca2+ sensor GCaMP6s. 24 h pretreatment with IL-6/IL-8 did not alter intracellular Ca2+. However, in IL-6/IL-8 pretreated cells, VLP S-D614G caused appearance of Ca2+waves and an overall increase in intracellular Ca2+ with a delay of ∼10 min after VLP addition. We conclude that the diarrhea of COVID-19 appears to an example of a calcium dependent inflammatory diarrhea that involves both acutely stimulated Ca2+ dependent anion secretion (stimulated Isc) that involves CaCC and likely inhibition of neutral NaCl absorption (decreased NHE3 protein and mRNA and decreased DRA mRNA).","Donowitz, Mark; Tse, Chung-Ming; Dokladny, Karol; Rawat, Manmeet; Horwitz, Ivy; Ye, Chunyan; Kell, Alison; Lin, Ruxian; Lee, Sun; Guo, Chenxu; Tsai, Shang Jui; Cox, Andrea; Gould, Stephen; In, Julie; Bradfute, Steven; Zachos, Nicholas C.; Kovbasnjuk, Olga",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33948596/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.27.441695,288

Plasma donation, in contrast, despite being a similar process, is mostly a paid activity in which donors are compensated for their contribution to the production of therapeutic preparations. This creates a so-called “plasma paradox:” If remuneration is promised for a socially useful effort, volunteers with altruistic motives might be deterred. At the same time, regular plasma donors who pursue the monetary benefits of donation might drop out if remuneration stops. The same controversy can be caught in the messages of most plasma donation companies as well: They promise a monetary reward (MR), and at the same time, highlight the altruistic component of donation. In this study, we tested the assumption that emphasizing the social significance enhances the willingness to donate blood plasma more effectively than either MR or the combination of these two incentives. This had to be rejected since there was no significant difference between the three scenarios. Furthermore, we also hypothesized that individuals might be more motivated to donate plasma if there is a possibility of offering an MR toward other socially beneficial aims. We found an increased willingness to donate in scenarios enabling “double altruism”, that is, when donating plasma for therapeutic use and transferring their remuneration to nongovernmental organizations, is an option. We propose relying on double altruism to resolve the plasma paradox, and suggest that it could serve as a starting point for the development of more optimized means for donor recruitment.","Gyuris, Petra; Gáspár, Baksa Gergely; Birkás, Béla; Csókási, Krisztina; Kocsor, Ferenc",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34566745/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.653848,288

With the measures taken, the difficulties in women's daily lives are increasing exponentially. This situation has caused women to experience more mental health problems. OBJECTIVE: To identify the relationship between women's health anxiety and psychological wellbeing and the factors affecting these situations during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN AND SETTING: Descriptive study conducted online among women living in Adana, Turkey. METHOD: This descriptive study was conducted among 623 married women between April 1 and April 20, 2020, using a SurveyMonkey online questionnaire. Data were collected using the link that was established. The questions comprised personal information, perceptions regarding the pandemic, the Health Anxiety Inventory (Short Form) and the Psychological Wellbeing Scale. RESULTS: The women who participated were found to have a high level of anxiety and a moderate level of psychological wellbeing. A positive, moderate-level relationship was found between the scales. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has had negative effects on both physical and psychological health. Support for women, to be provided within their holistic understanding of care, is of great importance for maintaining the psychological health of society.","Akbas, Meltem; Sulu, Rukiye; Gozuyesil, Ebru",Säo Paulo med. j,https://doi.org/10.1590/1516-3180.2021.0155.r1.22042021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34378738/,288
619417,Shedding of infectious SARS-CoV-2 from airways in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in relation to serum antibody responses,2020-09-13,"Abstract Objectives In December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan city, China, which has subsequently led to a global pandemic. At the time of writing, COVID-19 in Wuhan appears to be in the final phase and under control. However, many other countries, especially the US, Italy and Spain, are still in the early phases and dealing with increasing cases every day. Therefore, this article aims to summarise and share the experience of controlling the spread of COVID-19 in Wuhan and provide effective suggestions to enable other countries to save lives. Study Design Data from the National Health Commission of China is used to investigate the evolution trajectory of COVID-19 in Wuhan and discuss the impacts of the intervention strategies. Methods A four-stage modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model is presented. This model considers many influencing factors, including chunyun (the Spring festival), sealing off the city and constructing the Fang Cang shelter hospitals. In addition, a novel method is proposed to address the abnormal data on 12-13 February as a result of changing diagnostic criteria. Four different scenarios are considered to capture different intervention measures in practice. The exposed population in Wuhan who moved out prior to sealing off the city have also been identified and an analysis on where they had gone was performed using the Baidu migration index. Results The results demonstrate that the four-stage model was effective in forecasting the peak, size and duration of COVID-19. We found that the combined intervention measures are the only effective way to control the spread and not a single one of them can be omitted. We estimate that England will be another epicentre due to its incorrect response at the initial stages of COVID-19. Fortunately, big data technology can help provide early warnings to new areas of the pandemic. Conclusions The four-stage SEIR model was effective in capturing the evolution trajectory of COVID-19. Based on the model analysis, several effective suggestions are proposed to prevent and control the pandemic for countries that are still in the initial phases.","Liu, Ming; Ning, Jing; Du, Yurui; Cao, Jie; Zhang, Ding; Wang, Jiangang; Chen, Mingjun",Public Health,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2020.05.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32442842/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033350620301542?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0033350620301542,288

METHODS: We tested a cohort of 9449 employees at work at the Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and antibodies, linked the testing results to sick leave records and determined associations with past or future sick leave using multinomial logistic regression. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04411576. RESULTS: Subjects with high amounts of SARS-CoV-2 virus, as indicated by the Cycle threshold (Ct) value in the PCR, had the highest risk for sick leave in the two weeks after testing (OR 11.97 (CI 95% 6.29-22.80)) whereas subjects with low amounts of virus had the highest risk for sick leave in the past three weeks before testing (OR 6.31 (4.38-9.08)). Only 2.5% of employees were SARS-CoV-2 positive while 10.5% were positive by serology and 1.2% were positive in both tests. Serology-positive subjects were not at excess risk for future sick leave (OR 1.06 (95% CI, 0.71-1.57)). CONCLUSIONS: High amounts of SARS-CoV-2 virus, as determined using PCR Ct values, associates with development of sickness in the next few weeks. The results support the concept that PCR Ct may be informative when testing for SARS-CoV-2 is performed.","Dillner, Joakim; Elfström, K Miriam; Blomqvist, Jonas; Engstrand, Lars; Uhlén, Mathias; Eklund, Carina; Boulund, Fredrik; Lagheden, Camilla; Hamsten, Marica; Nordqvist-Kleppe, Sara; Seifert, Maike; Hellström, Cecilia; Olofsson, Jennie; Andersson, Eni; Falk, August Jernbom; Bergström, Sofia; Hultin, Emilie; Pin, Elisa; Pimenoff, Ville N; Hassan, Sadaf; Månberg, Anna; Nilsson, Peter; Hedhammar, My; Hober, Sophia; Mattsson, Johan; Mühr, Laila Sara Arroyo; Lundgren, Kalle Conneryd",J Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33580261/; https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiab099,288

In addition to infecting and taking the lives of millions of global citizens, the pandemic has fundamentally changed family and work patterns. The pandemic and associated mitigation measures have increased the unemployment rates, amplified health risks for essential workers required to work on‐site, and led to unprecedented rates of telecommuting. Additionally, due to school/daycare closures and social distancing, many parents have lost access to institutional and informal childcare support during the COVID‐19 crisis. Such losses in childcare support have significantly impacted the paid and unpaid labor of parents, particularly of mothers. In this article, we synthesize recent research on pandemic‐related changes to work and family in the United States. Applying an intersectionality lens, we discuss the gendered implications of these changes. Because gender inequality in family and work are connected, COVID‐19 has, in many cases, deepened the pre‐existing gender inequalities in both realms.","Yavorsky, Jill E.; Qian, Yue; Sargent, Amanda C.",Sociol Compass,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34230836/; https://doi.org/10.1111/soc4.12881,288
621842,Sick from What? Trauma During the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic,2021-04-21,"SARS-CoV-2 has a zoonotic origin and was transmitted to humans via an undetermined intermediate host, leading to infections in humans and other mammals. To enter host cells, the viral spike protein (S-protein) binds to its receptor, ACE2, and is then processed by TMPRSS2. Whilst receptor binding contributes to the viral host range, S-protein:ACE2 complexes from other animals have not been investigated widely. To predict infection risks, we modelled S-protein:ACE2 complexes from 215 vertebrate species, calculated changes in the energy of the complex caused by mutations in each species, relative to human ACE2, and correlated these changes with COVID-19 infection data. We also analysed structural interactions to better understand the key residues contributing to affinity. We predict that mutations are more detrimental in ACE2 than TMPRSS2. Finally, we demonstrate phylogenetically that human SARS-CoV-2 strains have been isolated in animals. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can infect a broad range of mammals, but few fish, birds or reptiles. Susceptible animals could serve as reservoirs of the virus, necessitating careful ongoing animal management and surveillance.","Lam, SD; Bordin, N; Waman, VP; Scholes, HM; Ashford, P; Sen, N; van Dorp, L; Rauer, C; Dawson, NL; Pang, CSM; Abbasian, M; Sillitoe, I; Edwards, SJL; Fraternali, F; Lees, JG; Santini, JM; Orengo, CA",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.01.072371,288

METHODS: A literature search was performed to identify information pertinent to steroid administration and the subsequent downstream effects on vaccine efficacy. The search was initiated on December 20, 2020, and the terms used were (steroid OR cortisone OR dexamethasone) AND (vaccine). The studies were limited to articles in the English language. RESULTS: Six studies specifically addressed the effect of steroids on vaccine efficacy. Three of the 6 studies indicated that steroids could be used during the peri‐vaccine period without significant suppression of the immune response. One study associated intra‐articular steroid injections with an increased risk of developing influenza even when vaccinated. The remaining 2 studies had mixed findings. One study showed that patients who received dexamethasone, but not prednisolone were able to mount an immune response resulting in increased IgG. Another study showed that vaccine efficacy was maintained if patients were on continuous steroids or steroids after vaccination, but not if they stopped steroids prior to vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Although there is no shared consensus in the studies reviewed, all but one study noted scenarios in which patients receiving steroids can still be successfully vaccinated.","Chow, Robert M.; Rajput, Kanishka; Howie, Benjamin A.; Varhabhatla, Narayana",Pain Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34314563/; https://doi.org/10.1111/papr.13062,288

Academic Medical Centers became a center‐point for the response to the virus. Leaders within academic medical centers faced twin challenges of responding to the needs of the patients we serve while managing radical changes within their own institutions, including the educational mission. In this article, we describe some key themes identified and lessons learned as educational leaders during this time. We draw from the experiences of two institutions‐ one public and one private. These lessons learned fall into the broad categories of leadership decision‐making and communication and included the importance of principled decision‐making, a connected leadership team, and effective communication both within leadership and to the broader institutional community. The consequences of these responses resulted in a renewed recognition for us as educational leaders of the interdependence of our tripartide academic fates, the importance of academic medical centers as anchor institutions and advocates for our community, and the resilience and ingenuity of our students. We provide examples of these lessons and themes and make recommendations for how to approach educational decision‐making in the “new normal” of living with COVID‐19 for the immediate future.","Aagaard, Eva M.; Earnest, Mark",FASEB Bioadv,https://doi.org/10.1096/fba.2020-00113; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33733057/,288

623894,Kidney transplantation and patients who decline SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccination: an ethical framework,2021-07-19,"INTRODUCTION: Consumer engagement is central to high-quality cancer service delivery and is a recognised strategy to minimise healthcare-associated harm. Strategies developed to enhance consumer engagement specifically in relation to preventing healthcare harm include questioning health professionals, raising concerns about possible mistakes or risks in care and encouraging patients and caregivers to report suspected errors. Patients from ethnic minority backgrounds are particularly vulnerable to unsafe care, but current engagement strategies have not been developed specifically for (and with) this population. Using an adapted approach to experience-based codesign (EBCD) to support the target population, the aim of the project is to codesign consumer engagement interventions to increase consumer engagement and safety in New South Wales and Victorian cancer inpatient, outpatient and day procedure services. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A mixed-method project will be undertaken at six study sites. Our EBCD approach includes a preparatory phase in which we will provide training and support to the codesign participants, in addition to recruiting and training consumer cofacilitators for the codesign workshops. The project will follow the EBCD process of gathering and synthesising observational data from each cancer service, with interview data from consumers and staff. With the resulting in-depth understanding of the safety threats commonly experienced by ethnic minority consumers in each site, we will work through feedback events and codesign groups with consumers and staff to determine how they can be more involved with their care to minimise the potential for patient harm. Consumer engagement interventions will be coproduced in each of the six participating services that are tailored to the ethnic minority populations served. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval has been obtained from the Western Sydney Local Health District Human Research Ethics Committee. The project will provide strategies for ethnic minority consumers to engage with cancer services to minimise healthcare-associated harm that may be applied to diverse healthcare settings.","Harrison, Reema; Walton, Merrilyn; Manias, Elizabeth; Wilson, Carlene; Girgis, Afaf; Chin, Melvin; Leone, Desiree; Seale, Holly; Smith, Allan Ben; Chauhan, Ashfaq",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34341049/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-048389,288

Nine months later (Sept. 18, 2020), the virus has infected > 30 million people world-wide and caused > 944.000 (3.15 %) fatalities in 220 countries and territories. Research on the genetics of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, its mutants and their penetrance can aid future defense strategies. By analyzing sequence data deposited between December 2019 and end of May 2020, we have compared nucleotide sequences of 570 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from China, Europe, the US, and India to the sequence of the Wuhan isolate. During world-wide spreading among human populations, at least 10 distinct hotspot mutations had been selected and found in up to > 80 % of viral genomes. Many of these mutations led to amino acid exchanges in replication-relevant viral proteins. Mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome would also impinge upon the secondary structure of the viral RNA molecule and its repertoire of interactions with essential cellular and viral proteins. The increasing frequency of SARS-CoV-2 mutation hotspots might select for dangerous viral pathogens. Alternatively, in a 29.900 nucleotide-genome, there might be a limit to the number of mutable and selectable sites which, when exhausted, could prove disadvantageous to viral survival. The speed, at which novel SARS-CoV-2 mutants are selected and dispersed around the world, could pose problems for the development of vaccines and therapeutics.","Weber, Stefanie; Ramirez, Christina; Doerfler, Walter",Virus Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170220310777; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32979477/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170220310777?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2020.198170,288

For example, when given time series of COVID-19 cases in a region, we may raise early warning signals of an epidemic by detecting signs of changes in the data. We propose a novel methodology to address this issue. The key idea is to employ a new information-theoretic notion, which we call the differential minimum description length change statistics (D-MDL), for measuring the scores of change sign. We first give a fundamental theory for D-MDL. We then demonstrate its effectiveness using synthetic datasets. We apply it to detecting early warning signals of the COVID-19 epidemic using time series of the cases for individual countries. We empirically demonstrate that D-MDL is able to raise early warning signals of events such as significant increase/decrease of cases. Remarkably, for about [Formula: see text] of the events of significant increase of cases in studied countries, our method can detect warning signals as early as nearly six days on average before the events, buying considerably long time for making responses. We further relate the warning signals to the dynamics of the basic reproduction number R0 and the timing of social distancing. The results show that our method is a promising approach to the epidemic analysis from a data science viewpoint.","Yamanishi, Kenji; Xu, Linchuan; Yuki, Ryo; Fukushima, Shintaro; Lin, Chuan-hao",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-98781-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34611186/,288

625653,Impact of gender on patients hospitalized for SARS‐COV‐2 infection: A prospective observational study,2021-03-26,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, has required a rapid and drastic transformation of health systems worldwide, and consequently also of Spanish Nephrology Units, to respond to the critical situation. The adaptation and transformation of nephrology services during the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain was a urgent need. During this period is worth noting that outpatient nephrology consultations were carried out largely virtually. In conclusion, the pandemic has clearly impacted clinical activity in Spanish Nephrology departments including ours at Virgen de las Nieves University hospital (Granada), reducing elective activity. METHOD: At the beginning of the pandemic, we quickly adapted by designing an outpatient healthcare model adapted to the situation. With a virtual model we established direct communication via online almost in ""real time"" between primary care and our Nephrology Service consultation, avoiding unnecessary travel of patients and relatives, risk exposures to interpersonal and reducing the cost and the public crowds in the hospital. Based on inter-consultation criteria adapted to the guidelines and consensus documents of different societies, we established a new intercommunication system between Primary Care Physicians and external nephrology consultations, to FILTER consultations that did not require unnecessary exposures and reducing the cost of healthcare and the waiting time among others. Between June 2020 and December 2021, we received 372 cases referred from Primary Care for a first virtual assessment in the high-resolution nephrology clinic, clinical recommendations were effectively issued regarding complementary tests, treatment … and the need to refer to our Nephrology outpatient clinic for study and follow-up or not. RESULTS: Of the 372 patients evaluated VIRTUALLY, 38 were referred by Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) of which 35 were discharged with follow-up by their Primary Care Physician, 37 patients were referred by eGFR <30 ml / min / 1.73m2 being discharged 29, 66 patients were referred by eGFR between 30-60 ml / min / 1.73m2, being discharged 51 , 15 had Albumin / creatinine ratio (ACR ) between 30-300 mg / gr discharging 100%, 22 cases were consulted for ultrasound renal abnormalities and 18 of them were discharged, 5 were referred for apparently non-urological hematuria, not requiring nephrological follow-up in any case, the reason for referral ""other causes"" had n = 102 of which the main reason was ""loss of an appointment in consultation during the pandemic"", nephrectomy, kidney transplants with decompensation, family history of hereditary kidney disease (PKD, Alport …) without follow up need in n=95 of cases In Spain the activity of presential care in outpatient Nephrology consultations was suspended in 47% of the services, carrying out activity through telephone calls in 98.9%, that is, in the majority of Spanish hospitals. In 16.5% of the centers, telemedicine was the only form of external clinical visits. In 57% of the centers, outpatient follow-up tests were stopped during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: The actual COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated that a transformation and adaptation plan based on the optimization of resources, the implementation of telemedicine and the reorganization of our healthcare activity is necessary. The activity of presential care in outpatient Nephrology consultations was suspended in 47% of the Spanish Nephrology services(1).

This meta-analysis aimed to assess the pooled incidence of COVID-19 complications and to identify the association between the incidence of complications and age. METHODS: Comprehensive databases, PubMed, Hinari, and Google Scholar, were used to locate potential articles for this review. Data were extracted using Microsoft Excel and imported to the STATA/MP version 16.0 software for analysis. Heterogeneity between studies was assessed using the Cochrane Q test statistics and I(2) test, and small study effect was checked using Egger’s statistical test at 5% significant level. Sensitivity analysis was checked. A random-effects model was conducted to estimate the pooled incidence of COVID-19 complications. Univariate meta-regression was conducted to identify the association between the mean ages with each complication. RESULTS: From the total of 1237 studies, 12 studies were included with a total of 3064 COVID-19 patients. The most complications were acute respiratory distress syndrome (30.93%, 95%CI 21.3–40.6%) followed by acute liver injury (22.8%, 95%CI 14–31.5%), shock (10.9%, 95%CI 7.4–14.4%), acute kidney injury (7%, 95%CI 3.8–10.4%), and acute cardiac injury (6.4%, 95%CI 2.8–15.6%). Univariate meta-regression revealed that as the mean age increased by 1 year, the incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury, acute cardiac injury, and shock increased by a factor of 2.9 (β = 2.9, 95%CI 2.4–3.4, adjusted R(2) = 88), 0.4 (β = 0.4, 95%CI 0.04–0.72, adjusted R(2) = 54), 1.6 (β = 1.6, 95%CI 1.1–2.1, adjusted R(2) = 85), and 1.1 (β = 1.1, 95%CI 0.8–1.5, adjusted R(2) = 26) times respectively.

In this study, an immunochromatographic assay (ICA) based on a EuNPs-mAb fluorescent probe was developed and optimized for rapid detection of PEDV. The limit of detection (LOD) of the ICA was 0.218 μg/mL (2.725 × 10(3) TCID(50)/mL) and its linear detection range was 0.03125–8 μg/mL (3.91 × 10(2)-10(5) TCID(50)/mL). The ICA was also validated for the detection of PEDV in swine stool samples. 60 swine stool samples from southern China were analyzed by the ICA and RT-PCR, and the results showed that the coincidence rate of the ICA to RT-PCR was 86.67%, which was significantly higher than that of AuNPs based ICA.

627449,Risks of lung transplantation in the SARS-CoV-2 era,2020-12-01,"Since the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was designated as a pandemic by the World Health Organization, health care systems have been forced to adapt rapidly to defer less urgent care during the crisis. The United States (U.S.) has adopted a four-phase approach to decreasing and then resuming non-essential work. Through strong restrictive measures, Phase I slowed the spread of disease, allowing states to safely diagnose, isolate, and treat patients with COVID-19. In support of social distancing measures, non-urgent studies were postponed, and this created a backlog. Now, as states transition to Phase II, restrictions on non-essential activities will ease, and radiology departments must re-establish care while continuing to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 transmission all while accommodating this backlog. In this article, we propose a roadmap that incorporates the current practice guidelines and subject matter consensus statements for the phased reopening of non-urgent and elective radiology services. This roadmap will focus on operationalizing these recommendations for patient care and workforce management. Tiered systems are proposed for the prioritization of elective procedures, with physician-to-physician communication encouraged. Infection control methods, provision of personal protective equipment (PPE), and physical distancing measures are highlighted. Finally, changes in hours of operation, hiring strategies, and remote reading services are discussed for their potential to ease the transition to normal operations.","Azam, Saif A.; Myers, Lee; Fields, Brandon K.K.; Demirjian, Natalie L.; Patel, Dakshesh; Roberge, Eric; Gholamrezanezhad, Ali; Reddy, Sravanthi",Clin Imaging,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinimag.2020.05.032; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899707120302011; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0899707120302011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32512479/,288

Examining the association between housing and health during the pandemic is imperative to reducing health inequities and improving population health. METHODS: We analysed 957 714 responses from the Household Pulse Survey Study, collected between April and July 2020. Using survey-weighted multivariable regression analyses, we assessed the relationships between housing tenure and health, both on average and over time, as well as how these relationships were moderated by COVID-19-related hardships including job loss, food insecurity and inability to afford housing-related costs. We controlled for a variety of potential socioeconomic and demographic confounding factors. RESULTS: We found that housing tenure was significantly associated with both self-rated health and mental distress. Compared with homeowners without mortgage debt, homeowners with mortgage debt reported worse self-rated health (β=−0.13; 95% CI −0.15 to −0.12, p<0.001) and greater mental distress (β=0.50; 95% CI 0.44 to 0.55, p<0.001). Renters also reported worse self-rated health (β=−0.18; 95% CI −0.20 to −0.16, p<0.001) and greater mental distress (β=0.76; 95% CI 0.69 to 0.83, p<0.001) than homeowners without mortgage debt. Across all tenure groups, self-rated health decreased (β=−0.007; 95% CI −0.011 to −0.004, p<0.001) and mental distress increased (β=0.05; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.06, p<0.001) over this period. Additionally, time and COVID-19-related hardships compounded differences in health status between homeowners and renters. CONCLUSIONS: These results add to a limited body of evidence suggesting that, during this period, housing instability and COVID-19-related hardships have contributed to an increase in health inequities in the USA.","Bushman, Gregory; Mehdipanah, Roshanak",J Epidemiol Community Health,https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2021-216764; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34226259/,288

The prioritisation of high value cancer interventions must be embedded in the agenda for the pandemic response, ensuring that no inconsistency or discrepancy emerge in the health planning processes. The aim of this work is to organise health interventions for breast cancer management and research in a tiered framework (high, medium, low value), formulating a scheme of prioritisation per clinical cogency and intrinsic value or magnitude of benefit. The public health tools and schemes for priority setting in oncology have been used as models, aspiring to capture clinical urgency, value in healthcare, community goals and fairness, while respecting the principles of benevolence, non-maleficence, autonomy and justice. We discuss the priority health interventions across the cancer continuum, giving a perspective on the role and meaning to maintain some services (undeferrable) while temporarily abrogate some others (deferrable). Considerations for implementation and the essential link to pre-existing health services, especially primary healthcare, are addressed, outlining a framework for the development of effective and functional services, such as telemedicine. The discussion covers the theme of health systems strategising, and why oncology care, in particular breast cancer care, should be maintained in parallel to pandemic control measures, providing a pragmatic clinical model within the broader context of public healthcare schemes.","de Azambuja, Evandro; Trapani, Dario; Loibl, Sibylle; Delaloge, Suzette; Senkus, Elzbieta; Criscitiello, Carmen; Poortman, Philip; Gnant, Michael; Di Cosimo, Serena; Cortes, Javier; Cardoso, Fatima; Paluch-Shimon, Shani; Curigliano, Giuseppe",ESMO Open,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2059702920326727; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32439716/; https://doi.org/10.1136/esmoopen-2020-000793; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2059702920326727,288

METHODS: A literature review was conducted using Google Scholar® and MEDLINE®/PubMed® to identify current available evidence regarding the sensitivity of CT chest in comparison to RT‐PCR for diagnosis of COVID‐19 positive patients. GRADE criteria and the QUADAS 2 tool was used to assess the level of evidence. RESULTS: A total of 20 articles were identified that addressed the question of sensitivity of CT for diagnosis of COVID‐19 positive symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Overall sensitivity of CT scan ranged from 57%‐100% for symptomatic and 46%‐100% for asymptomatic COVID‐19 patients, while that of RT‐PCR ranged from 39%‐89%. CT chest was a better diagnostic modality and capable of detecting active infection earlier in the time course of infection than RT‐PCR in symptomatic patients. In asymptomatic patients, disease prevalence seems to play a role in the positive predictive value. Minimal evidence exists regarding the sensitivity of CT in patients who are asymptomatic. CONCLUSIONS: In surgical patients, CT Chest should be considered as an important adjunct for detection of COVID‐19 infection in patients who are symptomatic with negative RT‐PCR prior to any operation. For surgical patients who are asymptomatic, there is insufficient evidence to recommend routine preoperative CT Chest for COVID‐19 screening.","Shao, Jenny M; Ayuso, Sullivan A; Deerenberg, Eva B; Elhage, Sharbel A; Augenstein, Vedra; Heniford, B.

630054,Letter regarding “Minimal change disease relapse following SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine”,2021-05-27,"Free radical reactions play an important role in biological functions of living systems. The balance between oxidants and antioxidants is necessary for the normal homeostasis of cells and organisms. Experimental works demonstrate the role of oxidative stress that is caused by influenza virus as well as the toxic effects of some antiviral drugs. Therefore, antiviral drugs should be characterized by its pro- and antioxidant activity, because it can affect its therapeutic efficiency. The aim of the study was to quantify the antioxidant capacity and propose the mechanism of the antioxidant effect of the antiviral drug Umifenovir (Arbidol(®)). The kinetic chemiluminescence with the 2,2’-azobis (2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride + luminol system was used to quantify the antioxidant capacity of Umifenovir relative to the standard compound Trolox. With computer simulation, the reaction scheme and rate constants were proposed. The antioxidant capacity of 0.9 μM Umifenovir (maximum concentration of Umifenovir in blood after oral administration of 200 mg) was as high as 1.65 ± 0.18 μM of Trolox. Thus, the total antioxidant capacity of Umifenovir is comparable to the antioxidant capacity of Trolox. Unlike Trolox, Umifenovir reacts with free radicals in two stages. For Trolox, the free radical scavenging rate constant was k = 2000 nM(−1) min.(−1), for Umifenovir k(1) = 300 nM(−1)min.(−1), k(2) = 4 nM(−1)min.(−1). Slower kinetics of Umifenovir provides the prolonged antioxidant effect when compared to Trolox. This phenomenon can make a serious contribution to the compensation of oxidative stress that is caused by a viral disease and the therapeutic effect of the drug.","Proskurnina, Elena V.; Izmailov, Dmitry Yu.; Sozarukova, Madina M.; Zhuravleva, Tatiana A.; Leneva, Irina A.; Poromov, Artem A.",Molecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules25071577; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32235534/,288

However, no comprehensive evaluation of these molecules in the context of the achievable plasma pharmacokinetics after administration of approved doses and schedules to humans has been conducted. Moreover, most publications have focussed on 50% maximum effective concentrations (EC50), which may be an insufficiently robust indicator of antiviral activity because of marked differences in the slope of the concentration-response curve between drugs. Accordingly, in vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity data was digitised from all available publications up to 13th April 2020 and used to recalculate an EC90 value for each drug. EC90 values were then expressed as a ratio to the achievable maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) reported for each drug after administration of the approved dose to humans (Cmax/EC90 ratio). Only 14 of the analysed drugs achieved a Cmax/EC90 ratio above 1 meaning that plasma Cmax concentrations exceeded those necessary to inhibit 90% of SARS-CoV-2 replication. A more in-depth assessment of these drugs demonstrated that only nitazoxanide, nelfinavir, tipranavir (boosted with ritonavir) and sulfadoxine achieved plasma concentrations above their anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity across their entire approved dosing interval at their approved human dose. For all drugs reported, the unbound lung to plasma tissue partition coefficient (KpUlung) was also simulated and used along with reported Cmax and fraction unbound in plasma to derive a lung Cmax/EC50 as a better indicator of potential human efficacy (lung Cmax/EC90 ratio was also calculable for a limited number of drugs). Using this parameter hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, mefloquine, atazanavir (boosted with ritonavir), tipranavir (boosted with ritonavir), ivermectin, azithromycin and lopinavir (boosted with ritonavir) were all predicted to achieve lung concentrations over 10-fold higher than their reported EC50. This analysis was not possible for nelfinavir because insufficient data were available to calculate KpUlung but nitozoxanide and sulfadoxine were also predicted to exceed their reported EC50 by 3.1- and 1.5-fold in lung, respectively. The antiviral activity data reported to date is of variable quality and conducted under different conditions by different investigators. However, this analysis has prioritised candidates with the best chance for success in therapy or chemoprevention of Covid-19 based upon the currently available in vitro activity and human plasma pharmacokinetic data. Future studies should focus on EC90 values and discuss findings in the context of achievable exposures in humans, especially within target compartments such as the lung, in order to maximise the potential for success of proposed human clinical trials.","Arshad, U.; Pertinez, H.; Box, H.; Tatham, L.; Rajoli, R.

Among other domains, it contains three sequentially arranged macrodomains: the X domain and subdomains SUD-N as well as SUD-M within the “SARS-unique domain”. The X domain was proposed to be an ADP-ribose-1”-phosphatase or a poly(ADP-ribose)-binding protein, whereas SUD-NM binds oligo(G)-nucleotides capable of forming G-quadruplexes. Here, we describe the application of a reverse genetic approach to assess the importance of these macrodomains for the activity of the SARS-CoV RTC. To this end, Renilla luciferase-encoding SARS-CoV replicons with selectively deleted macrodomains were constructed and their ability to modulate the RTC activity was examined. While the SUD-N and the X domains were found to be dispensable, the SUD-M domain was crucial for viral genome replication/transcription. Moreover, alanine replacement of charged amino-acid residues of the SUD-M domain, which are likely involved in G-quadruplex-binding, caused abrogation of RTC activity.","Kusov, Yuri; Tan, Jinzhi; Alvarez, Enrique; Enjuanes, Luis; Hilgenfeld, Rolf",Virology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682215002949; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26149721/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682215002949; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2015.06.016,288

The toxicity of α-Fe(2)O(3)/Fe(3)O(4) heterogeneous nanoparticles to human hepatocytes L-02, the blood routine, and the histopathological section observation of mice were explored. The results showed that the ratio of ferric nitrate and urea was a key factor to affect the relative content of Fe(3)O(4) in the heterogeneous nanoparticles. The calcination temperature and the calcination time had similar influences, and the corresponding calcination temperature and the calcination time were selected according to their own needs. The CCK8 results initially revealed that α-Fe(2)O(3)/Fe(3)O(4) heterogeneous nanoparticles had no effect on cell viability when the concentration of the heterogeneous nanoparticles was less than 100 ng/mL, which suggested their excellent biocompatibility. At the same time, the tail vein administration concentration of 0.9 mg/kg had good biological safety.","Li, You; Wang, Zhou; Liu, Ruijiang",Nanomaterials (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33805140/; https://doi.org/10.3390/nano11040834,288
633763,Responses to SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination in Patients with Cancer (ReCOVer Study): A Prospective Cohort Study of the Hellenic Cooperative Oncology Group,2021-09-15,"BACKGROUND: With its epicenter in Wuhan, China, the COVID-19 outbreak was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). While many countries have implemented flight restrictions to China, an increasing number of cases with or without travel background to China are confirmed daily. These developments support concerns on possible unidentified and unreported international COVID-19 cases, which could lead to new local disease epicenters. METHODS: We have analyzed all available data on the development of international COVID-19 cases from January 20th, 2020 until February 18th, 2020. COVID-19 cases with and without travel history to China were divided into cohorts according to the Healthcare Access and Quality Index (HAQ-Index) of each country. Chi-square and Post-hoc testing were performed. RESULTS: While COVID-19 cases with travel history to China seem to peak for each HAQ-cohort, the number of non-travel related COVID-19 cases seem to continuously increase in the HAQ-cohort of countries with higher medical standards. Further analyses demonstrate a significantly lower proportion of reported COVID-19 cases without travel history to China in countries with lower HAQ (HAQ I vs. HAQ II, posthoc p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that countries with lower HAQ-index may either underreport COVID-19 cases or are unable to adequately detect them. Although our data may be incomplete and must be interpreted with caution, inconsistencies in reporting COVID-19 cases is a serious problem which might sabotage efforts to contain the virus.","Lau, Hien; Khosrawipour, Veria; Kocbach, Piotr; Mikolajczyk, Agata; Ichii, Hirohito; Schubert, Justyna; Bania, Jacek; Khosrawipour, Tanja",J Microbiol Immunol Infect,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1684118220300736; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32205091/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1684118220300736; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.013,288
634463,Pan-cancer analysis of transmembrane protease serine 2 and cathepsin L that mediate cellular SARS-CoV-2 infection leading to COVID-19,2020-05-26,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is a catastrophic global phenomenon, affecting human life in a way unseen since the 1918 influenza pandemic. Effective management of this threat requires halting transmission, a strategy requiring accurate knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 transmission patterns. METHODS: This was a retrospective contact study aiming to estimate the transmission rate of COVID-19 by tracing contacts in symptomatic, pre-symptomatic, and asymptomatic patients. History of patients’ contacts during 24 h before appearance of symptoms or infection confirmation was traced for disease transmission. RESULTS: Overall, a total of 201 COVID-19 patients had contact with 7168 people in 24 h with an average of 35.66 contacts per patient, ranging from a minimum of 4 to maximum of 87 contacts (meetings). Out of 7168 persons met, infection was detected in 64 (0.89%). For the 155 symptomatic patients, a total of 5611 contacted persons were traced before appearance of symptoms (pre-symptomatic) in last 24 h with an average of 36.20 meetings per patient. The infection was transmitted in 63 (1.12%) people with 5548 (98.88%) remaining uninfected. Out of the 63 transmissions, 62 (98.4%) were traced within 6 h before symptom onset, while only 1 was identified in the 6–12 h timeframe before symptoms. A total of 1557 persons were traced having meeting/contacts with asymptomatic cases in last 24 h before infection confirmation. Out of these 1557 persons, only 1 was found to be infected and the infection rate was calculated to be 0.06%. Statistically, the transmission rate by pre-symptomatic patients was found to be significantly higher than the transmission rate by asymptomatic individuals (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: In the studied population, the risk of pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19 was low, with transmission risks of 1.12% and 0.06% respectively. Pre-symptomatic infection becomes very rare in contacts made longer than 6 h before onset of symptoms. The infection transmission is traced as long as about 9 h before the appearance of clear symptoms in the patients, but the incidence rate was as low as about 0.02% of the total contacts in that period.","Mahmood, Majid; Ilyas, Noor-ul-ain; Khan, Muhammad Faraz; Hasrat, Muhammad Naseem; Richwagen, Nicholas",Virol J,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-021-01609-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34217301/,288
634734,Diagnosis of Small Intestinal Disorders in Dogs and Cats,2015-08-19,"[Image: see text] We present a multivariate metabotyping approach to assess the functional recovery of nonhospitalized COVID-19 patients and the possible biochemical sequelae of “Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome”, colloquially known as long-COVID. Blood samples were taken from patients ca. 3 months after acute COVID-19 infection with further assessment of symptoms at 6 months. Some 57% of the patients had one or more persistent symptoms including respiratory-related symptoms like cough, dyspnea, and rhinorrhea or other nonrespiratory symptoms including chronic fatigue, anosmia, myalgia, or joint pain. Plasma samples were quantitatively analyzed for lipoproteins, glycoproteins, amino acids, biogenic amines, and tryptophan pathway intermediates using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Metabolic data for the follow-up patients (n = 27) were compared with controls (n = 41) and hospitalized severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (n = 18, with multiple time-points). Univariate and multivariate statistics revealed variable patterns of functional recovery with many patients exhibiting residual COVID-19 biomarker signatures. Several parameters were persistently perturbed, e.g., elevated taurine (p = 3.6 × 10(–3) versus controls) and reduced glutamine/glutamate ratio (p = 6.95 × 10(–8) versus controls), indicative of possible liver and muscle damage and a high energy demand linked to more generalized tissue repair or immune function. Some parameters showed near-complete normalization, e.g., the plasma apolipoprotein B100/A1 ratio was similar to that of healthy controls but significantly lower (p = 4.2 × 10(–3)) than post-acute COVID-19 patients, reflecting partial reversion of the metabolic phenotype (phenoreversion) toward the healthy metabolic state. Plasma neopterin was normalized in all follow-up patients, indicative of a reduction in the adaptive immune activity that has been previously detected in active SARS-CoV-2 infection. Other systemic inflammatory biomarkers such as GlycA and the kynurenine/tryptophan ratio remained elevated in some, but not all, patients. Correlation analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), and orthogonal-partial least-squares discriminant analysis (O-PLS-DA) showed that the follow-up patients were, as a group, metabolically distinct from controls and partially comapped with the acute-phase patients. Significant systematic metabolic differences between asymptomatic and symptomatic follow-up patients were also observed for multiple metabolites. The overall metabolic variance of the symptomatic patients was significantly greater than that of nonsymptomatic patients for multiple parameters (χ(2)p = 0.014). Thus, asymptomatic follow-up patients including those with post-acute COVID-19 Syndrome displayed a spectrum of multiple persistent biochemical pathophysiology, suggesting that the metabolic phenotyping approach may be deployed for multisystem functional assessment of individual post-acute COVID-19 patients.","Holmes, Elaine; Wist, Julien; Masuda, Reika; Lodge, Samantha; Nitschke, Philipp; Kimhofer, Torben; Loo, Ruey Leng; Begum, Sofina; Boughton, Berin; Yang, Rongchang; Morillon, Aude-Claire; Chin, Sung-Tong; Hall, Drew; Ryan, Monique; Bong, Sze-How; Gay, Melvin; Edgar, Dale W.; Lindon, John C.; Richards, Toby; Yeap, Bu B.; Pettersson, Sven; Spraul, Manfred; Schaefer, Hartmut; Lawler, Nathan G.; Gray, Nicola; Whiley, Luke; Nicholson, Jeremy K.",J Proteome Res,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.1c00224; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34009992/,288

634890,Use of Physiological Data From a Wearable Device to Identify SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Symptoms and Predict COVID-19 Diagnosis: Observational Study,2021-02-22,"BACKGROUND: Patients with sepsis may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Evidence of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in sepsis-induced lung injury has been reported. However, the role of circulating NETs in the progression and thrombotic tendency of sepsis-induced lung injury remains elusive. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of tissue factor-enriched NETs in the progression and immunothrombosis of sepsis-induced lung injury. METHODS: Human blood samples and an animal model of sepsis-induced lung injury were used to detect and evaluate NET formation in ARDS patients. Immunofluorescence imaging, ELISA, Western blotting, and qPCR were performed to evaluate in vitro NET formation and tissue factor (TF) delivery ability. DNase, an anti-TF antibody, and thrombin inhibitors were applied to evaluate the contribution of thrombin to TF-enriched NET formation and the contribution of TF-enriched NETs to immunothrombosis in ARDS patients. RESULTS: Significantly increased levels of TF-enriched NETs were observed in ARDS patients and mice. Blockade of NETs in ARDS mice alleviated disease progression, indicating a reduced lung wet/dry ratio and PaO2 level. In vitro data demonstrated that thrombin-activated platelets were responsible for increased NET formation and related TF exposure and subsequent immunothrombosis in ARDS patients. CONCLUSION: The interaction of thrombin-activated platelets with PMNs in ARDS patients results in local NET formation and delivery of active TF. The notion that NETs represent a mechanism by which PMNs release thrombogenic signals during thrombosis may offer novel therapeutic targets.","Zhang, Hao; Zhou, Yilu; Qu, Mengdi; Yu, Ying; Chen, Zhaoyuan; Zhu, Shuainan; Guo, Kefang; Chen, Wankun; Miao, Changhong",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2021.677902; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34336711/,288

The known human-infecting coronaviruses; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), novel SARS-CoV-2, human coronavirus (HCoV)-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43 and HKU1 cause mild to severe respiratory infections. The viral diseases induced by mammalian and avian viruses from Coronaviridae family pose significant economic and public health burdens. Due to increasing reports of viral resistance, co-infections and the emergence of viral epidemics such as COVID-19, available antiviral drugs show low or no efficacy, and the production of new treatments or vaccines are also challenging. Therefore, demand for the development of novel antivirals has considerably increased. In recent years, antiviral peptides have generated increasing interest as they are from natural and computational sources, are highly specific and effective, and possess the broad-spectrum activity with minimum side effects. Here, we have made an effort to compile and review the antiviral peptides with activity against Coronaviridae family viruses. They were divided into different categories according to their action mechanisms, including binding/attachment inhibitors, fusion and entry inhibitors, viral enzyme inhibitors, replication inhibitors and the peptides with direct and indirect effects on the viruses. Reported studies suggest optimism with regard to the design and production of therapeutically promising antiviral drugs. This review aims to summarize data relating to antiviral peptides particularly with respect to their applicability for development as novel treatments.","Heydari, Hamid; Golmohammadi, Reza; Mirnejad, Reza; Tebyanian, Hamid; Fasihi-Ramandi, Mahdi; Moosazadeh-moghadam, Mehrdad",Peptides,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33676968/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196978121000346; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2021.170526; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196978121000346?v=s5,288

Clinical presentation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is very variable amongst patients, and the literature about unusual presentations is growing rapidly. This lack of knowledge leads to diagnostic, therapeutic, and management challenges in such patients. Here, we describe a case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a low prevalence area which was initially diagnosed and managed as pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) in a high-risk inmate population. These ambiguous presentations can lead to mismanagement of such patients resulting in potentially fatal outcomes and public health crises in confined facilities. This also highlights the significance of a high index of clinical suspicion for SARS-CoV-2 especially in high risk and vulnerable populations.","Akbar, Hina; Kahloon, Rehan; Akbar, Sobia; Kahloon, Arslan",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.8464; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32528785/,288
635711,Impact of SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic on Patients with Primary Immunodeficiency,2020-12-01,"Canine astrovirus RNA was detected in the stools of 17/63 (26.9%) samples, using either a broadly reactive consensus RT-PCR for astroviruses or random RT-PCR coupled with massive deep sequencing. The complete or nearly complete genome sequence of five canine astroviruses was reconstructed that allowed mapping the genome organization and to investigate the genetic diversity of these viruses. The genome was about 6.6 kb in length and contained three open reading frames (ORFs) flanked by a 5′ UTR, and a 3′ UTR plus a poly-A tail. ORF1a and ORF1b overlapped by 43 nucleotides while the ORF2 overlapped by 8 nucleotides with the 3′ end of ORF1b. Upon genome comparison, four strains (HUN/2012/2, HUN/2012/6, HUN/2012/115, and HUN/2012/135) were more related genetically to each other and to UK canine astroviruses (88–96% nt identity), whilst strain HUN/2012/126 was more divergent (75–76% nt identity). In the ORF1b and ORF2, strains HUN/2012/2, HUN/2012/6, and HUN/2012/135 were related genetically to other canine astroviruses identified formerly in Europe and China, whereas strain HUN/2012/126 was related genetically to a divergent canine astrovirus strain, ITA/2010/Zoid. For one canine astrovirus, HUN/2012/8, only a 3.2 kb portion of the genome, at the 3′ end, could be determined. Interestingly, this strain possessed unique genetic signatures (including a longer ORF1b/ORF2 overlap and a longer 3′UTR) and it was divergent in both ORF1b and ORF2 from all other canine astroviruses, with the highest nucleotide sequence identity (68% and 63%, respectively) to a mink astrovirus, thus suggesting a possible event of interspecies transmission. The genetic heterogeneity of canine astroviruses may pose a challenge for the diagnostics and for future prophylaxis strategies.","Mihalov-Kovács, Eszter; Martella, Vito; Lanave, Gianvito; Bodnar, Livia; Fehér, Enikő; Marton, Szilvia; Kemenesi, Gábor; Jakab, Ferenc; Bányai, Krisztián",Virus Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27965150/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2016.12.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170216305731; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170216305731,288

Evaluating the burden of falls is key for planning, implementation, and evaluation of prevention strategies. To date, no studies have been published on accidental falls at the population level in Kuwait. We studied the burden of accidental falls on public hospital inpatient capacity in Kuwait and identified the subgroups with the highest utilization of inpatient service days. METHODS: From the national database of inpatient hospitalizations, we selected hospitalizations of patients admitted to Kuwait’s public hospitals for unintentional injury caused by an accidental fall from 1 January through 31 December 2016. We studied the number of inpatient service days (bed days), length of stay (LOS), and number of hospitalizations by age group, gender, and nationality. Mann–Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis, and Chi square tests were used for comparison. Logistic regression was used to quantify the risk of prolonged LOS and fractures among fall-related hospitalizations. RESULTS: Accidental falls were responsible for 2.9% of inpatient hospitalizations, 3.7% of inpatient service days (61,140 days) with an ALOS of 9.1 days in Kuwait’s public hospitals in 2016. Accidental falls were responsible for 4.6% of older adult service days, and an even higher 5.6% of older women service days. In the age group 13–64, fall-related service days for non-Kuwaitis (5.7%) were more than triple those for Kuwaitis (1.8%) with a substantial percentage among male non-Kuwaitis (8.1%). The risk factors for exceeding the national ALOS for fall-related hospitalizations were female gender (OR 1.36), age 65 and older (OR 9.72), age 13–64 (OR 5.20), being non-Kuwaiti (OR 1.39), sustaining a femur fracture (OR 11.67), and undergoing surgery (OR 2.63). Fall-related hospitalizations associated with a higher risk of fractures were females (OR 1.22), patients 65 years and older (OR 5.09), patients aged 13–64 (OR 3.65), and non-Kuwaitis (OR 1.28). CONCLUSIONS: Accidental falls impose a considerable burden on inpatient service utilization in Kuwait. This varies by age, gender, and nationality.

The current COVID-2019 pandemic is prompting fear of falling sick, dying, helplessness and stigma, urgent and timely understanding of mental health status is needed to help the community. Our investigation designed to survey the general population in Saudi Arabia to assess the degree of psychological impact during the pandemic. METHODS: During the early stage of the outbreak, we conducted an online-based survey using a snowballing sample technique. The surveys collected data about several aspects of participant sociodemographic, knowledge, concerns, psychological impact, and mental health status. We assessed the psychological impact and mental health status using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). RESULTS: Our survey recruited 1160 respondents of the general public of Saudi Arabia. Of them, 23.6% reported moderate or severe psychological impact of the outbreak, 28.3%,24%, and 22.3% reported moderate to severe depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms, respectively. Females reported IES-R (B: 5.46, 95% CI: 3.61 to 7.31) and DASS subscales B coefficient ranged from 1.65 to 2.63, along with high-school students, working in the medical field, and poor self-reported health status was significantly associated with a high level of IES-R and DASS scales (p < .05). Experiencing breathing difficulty and dizziness showed a stronger association with higher IES-R and DASS subscales than other somatic symptoms (e.g., headache and fever);(p < .001). Respondents who practiced specific preventative measures (e.g., hand washing, social distancing) demonstrated a protective effect against stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms. Social distancing appeared to be protective on stress and anxiety subscales (B: -1.49, 95% CI: −2.79 to −0.19),(B: -1.53, 95% CI: −2.50 to −0.57),respectively; and hand hygiene on depression subscale (B: -2.43, 95% CI: −4.44 to −0.42). CONCLUSION: Throughout the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak in Saudi Arabia, the results showed that nearly one-fourth of the sampled general population experienced moderate to severe psychological impact. Following specific precautionary measures appeared to have a protective effect on the individual's mental health. Our findings can be used to construct psychological interventions directed toward vulnerable populations and to implement public mental health strategies in the early stages of the outbreak.","Alkhamees, Abdulmajeed A.; Alrashed, Saleh A.; Alzunaydi, Ali A.; Almohimeed, Ahmed S.; Aljohani, Moath S.",Compr Psychiatry,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010440X20300341?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0010440X20300341; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comppsych.2020.152192; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32688022/,288

INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Group one: patients in the control arm will receive their standard package of prescribed care, following discharge home from hospital. If they experience any adverse physical or psychological health-conditions, they will access care through the usual available channels. Group two: patients randomly allocated to the intervention arm will receive their standard package of prescribed care, following discharge home from hospital. In addition, they will be referred to the Intensive Psychological Therapies Service in Poole, United Kingdom. They will receive an online appointment within 12-weeks of discharge home from hospital. They will receive a maximum of eight, weekly sessions of EMDR, delivered by a trained psychological therapist, following the Recent Traumatic Episode Protocol (R-TEP). Appendices 1 and 2 of the attached trial protocol contain a detailed description of the R-TEP intervention, written in accordance with the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) checklist and guide. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome from this trial will be feasibility. Feasibility will be determined by recruitment rates, expressed as a percentage of eligible patients approached, completion of the EMDR intervention, completion of final assessment at 6-months, incidence of attributable adverse events and protocol adherence by the psychological therapists. Secondary, exploratory outcomes will be assessed by comparison between the control and intervention groups at 6-months post-hospital discharge. Psychometric evaluation will consist of the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. In addition, we will assess health-related quality of life using the EQ5D-5L, physical activity using wrist worn activity monitors and nutritional state using the Council of Nutrition Appetite Questionnaire. RANDOMISATION: Consenting participants will be randomly allocated to intervention or usual care using an internet-based system (ALEA(TM)). Participants will be randomly assigned, on a 1:1 ratio, to receive either standard care (control) or the standard care plus online EMDR R-TEP (Intervention) BLINDING (MASKING): Due to the nature of the intervention, participants cannot be blinded to group allocation. 6-month patient reported outcome measures will be completed using an online, electronic case report form. Group allocation will be masked during data analysis. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): This is a feasibility study, the results of which will be used to power a definitive study if appropriate. We anticipate a 25% mortality /loss to follow-up. A total of 26 patients will be recruited to this study, 13 patients in each arm.

NxTAG RPP gave sensitivity of 95.2%, specificity of 99.6%, PPV of 93.5%, and NPV of 99.7%. NxTAG RPP, xTAG RVP, and FilmArray RP had highly concordant performance among each other for the detection of respiratory pathogens. The mean analytic sensitivity (TCID50/ml) of NxTAG RPP, xTAG RVP, and FilmArray RP for detection of swine/avian-origin influenza A subtype isolates was 0.7, 41.8, and 0.8, respectively. All three multiplex assays correctly typed and genotyped the influenza viruses, except for NxTAG RRP that could not distinguish H3N2 from H3N2v. Further investigation should be performed if H3N2v is suspected to be the cause of disease. Sensitive and specific laboratory diagnosis of all influenza A viruses subtypes is especially essential in certain epidemic regions, such as Southeast Asia. The results of this study should help clinical laboratory professionals to be aware of the different performances of commercially available molecular multiplex RT-PCR assays that are commonly adopted in many clinical diagnostic laboratories.","Chan, K.

Furthermore, we investigated the risk factors of long COVID in children and adolescents. METHODS: All consecutive children and adolescents who were referred to the hospitals anywhere in Fars province, Iran, from 19 February 2020 until 20 November 2020 were included. All patients had a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. In a phone call to patients/parents, at least 3 months after their discharge from the hospital, we obtained their current status and information if their parents agreed to participate. RESULTS: In total, 58 children and adolescents fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Twenty-six (44·8%) children/adolescents reported symptoms/complaints of long COVID. These symptoms included fatigue in 12 (21%), shortness of breath in 7 (12%), exercise intolerance in 7 (12%), weakness in 6 (10%), and walking intolerance in 5 (9%) individuals. Older age, muscle pain on admission, and intensive care unit admission were significantly associated with long COVID. CONCLUSIONS: Long COVID is a frequent condition in children and adolescents. The scientific community should investigate and explore the pathophysiology of long COVID to ensure that these patients receive appropriate treatments for their condition.

We employ an approach that values benefits and costs in terms of additions or subtractions to total production. Relative to a baseline in which only the infected and at-risk populations mitigate the spread of coronavirus, we estimate that total benefits of suppression policies to economic output are between $632.5 billion and $765.0 billion from early March 2020 to August 1, 2020. Relative to private mitigation, output lost due to suppression policies is estimated to be between $214.2 billion and $331.5 billion. The cost estimate is based on the duration of nonessential business closures and stay-at-home orders, which were enforced between 42 and 65 days. Our results indicate that the net benefits of suppression policies to slow the spread of COVID-19 are positive and may be substantial. We discuss uncertainty surrounding several parameters and employ alternative methods for valuing mortality benefits, which also suggest that suppression measures had positive net benefits.","Broughel, James; Kotrous, Michael",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0252729; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34081757/,288

Here, we deployed algorithms relying on artificial intelligence, network diffusion, and network proximity, tasking each of them to rank 6,340 drugs for their expected efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. To test the predictions, we used as ground truth 918 drugs experimentally screened in VeroE6 cells, as well as the list of drugs in clinical trials that capture the medical community’s assessment of drugs with potential COVID-19 efficacy. We find that no single predictive algorithm offers consistently reliable outcomes across all datasets and metrics. This outcome prompted us to develop a multimodal technology that fuses the predictions of all algorithms, finding that a consensus among the different predictive methods consistently exceeds the performance of the best individual pipelines. We screened in human cells the top-ranked drugs, obtaining a 62% success rate, in contrast to the 0.8% hit rate of nonguided screenings. Of the six drugs that reduced viral infection, four could be directly repurposed to treat COVID-19, proposing novel treatments for COVID-19. We also found that 76 of the 77 drugs that successfully reduced viral infection do not bind the proteins targeted by SARS-CoV-2, indicating that these network drugs rely on network-based mechanisms that cannot be identified using docking-based strategies. These advances offer a methodological pathway to identify repurposable drugs for future pathogens and neglected diseases underserved by the costs and extended timeline of de novo drug development.","Morselli Gysi, Deisy; do Valle, Ítalo; Zitnik, Marinka; Ameli, Asher; Gan, Xiao; Varol, Onur; Ghiassian, Susan Dina; Patten, J.

There are widespread reports of dwindling supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE), particularly N95-type filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs), which are paramount to protect frontline medical/nursing staff, and to minimize further spread of the virus. We carried out a rapid review to summarize the existing literature on the viability of SARS-CoV-2, the efficacy of key potential disinfection procedures against the virus (specifically ultraviolet light and heat), and the impact of these procedures on FFR performance, material integrity, and/or fit. In light of the recent discovery of SARS-CoV-2 and limited associated research, our review also focused on the closely related SARS-CoV-1. We propose a possible whole-of-PPE disinfection solution for potential reuse that could be rapidly instituted in many health care settings, without significant investments in equipment.","Derraik, José G.

We modified an existing N95 mask to optimize O(2) supplementation while maintaining respiratory isolation. METHODS: An N95 mask was modified to deliver O(2) by inserting a plastic manifold consisting of a 1-way inspiratory valve, an O(2) inlet and a gas reservoir. In a prospective repeated-measures study, we studied 10 healthy volunteers in each of 3 phases, investigating (1) the fractional inspiratory concentrations of O(2) (F(I)O(2)) delivered by the N95 O(2) mask, the Hi-Ox(80) O(2) mask, and the nonrebreathing mask during resting ventilation and hyperventilation, each at 3 O(2) flow rates; (2) the ability of the N95 mask, the N95 O(2) mask, and the nonrebreathing mask to filter microparticles from ambient air; and (3) to contain microparticles generated inside the mask. RESULTS: The F(I)O(2)s (median [range]) delivered by the Hi-Ox(80) O(2) mask, the N95 O(2) mask, and the nonrebreathing mask during resting ventilation, at 8 L/minute O(2) flow, were 0.90 (0.79 to 0.96), 0.68 (0.60 to 0.85), and 0.59 (0.52 to 0.68), respectively. During hyperventilation, the FiO(2)s of all 3 masks were clinically equivalent. The N95 O(2) mask, but not the nonrebreathing mask, provided the same efficiency of filtration of internal and external particles as the original N95, regardless of O(2) flow into the mask. CONCLUSION: An N95 mask can be modified to administer a clinically equivalent FiO(2) to a nonrebreathing mask while maintaining its filtration and isolation capabilities.","Mardimae, Alexandra; Slessarev, Marat; Han, Jay; Sasano, Hiroshi; Sasano, Nobuko; Azami, Takafumi; Fedorko, Ludwik; Savage, Tim; Fowler, Rob; Fisher, Joseph A.",Ann Emerg Med,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196064406009425; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196064406009425; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16997675/,288

METHODS: This was a retrospective outcomes study of renal transplant patients seen in Iraqi Kurdistan nephrology clinics in the year 2019. In 2019, 871 renal transplant patients were registered and outcomes followed through 12/31/2020. Indicated renal biopsies were obtained on 431 patients at 1 day to 18 years post-transplantation. Outcomes were compared with United States Renal Data System (USRDS) living donor reports. RESULTS: All donors were living. The recipient age was 38.5 ± 13.3 years, 98.2% were < 65 years old, 3.7% had previous transplants, and 2.8% had pretransplant donor-specific antibodies (DSA). Gehan-Breslow estimated failure rates for all-cause, return to HD, and death with functional graft were 6.0, 4.2, and 1.9% at 1 year and 18.1, 13.7, and 5.1% at 5 years post-engraftment (USRDS 2000; 1 year: 7.0, 5.0, 2.6%; 5 year: 22.3, 15.2, 10.6%. USRDS 2010; 1 year: 3.7, 2.4, 1.4%; 5 year: 15.3, 9.6, 7.3%). The median graft survival was 15 years. Acute tubular injury (ATI), infarction, and acute T cell-mediated rejection accounted for 22.2% of graft loss, with > 75% of these failures taking place in the first year. Most graft failures occurred late, at a median post-transplant time of 1125 (interquartile range, 365–2555) days, and consisted of interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IF/TA) (23.8%), transplant glomerulopathy (13.7%), and acquired active antibody-mediated rejection (12.0%). The significant predictors of graft loss were C4d + biopsies (P < 0.01) and advanced IF/TA (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Kurdistan transplant patients had graft failure rates similar to living donors reported by the USRDS for the year 2000 but higher than reported for 2010. Compared to USRDS 2010, Kurdistan patients had a moderate excess of HD failures at one and 5 years post-engraftment. Nevertheless, prolonged survival is the norm, with chronic disorders and acquired DSA being the leading causes of graft loss.","Ali, Alaa Abbas; Almukhtar, Safaa E.; Abd, Kais H.; Saleem, Zana Sidiq M.; Sharif, Dana A.; Hughson, Michael D.",BMC Nephrol,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12882-021-02486-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34364378/,288

However, past studies have not yet incorporated the effects of air travel on the transmission of influenza in the construction of mathematical epidemic models. Therefore, this paper focused on the human-to-human transmission of influenza, and investigated the effects of air travel activities on an influenza pandemic in a small-world network. These activities of air travel include passengers’ consolidation, conveyance and distribution in airports and flights. Dynamic transmission models were developed to assess the expected burdens of the pandemic, with and without control measures. This study also investigated how the small-world properties of an air transportation network facilitate the spread of influenza around the globe. The results show that, as soon as the influenza is spread to the top 50 global airports, the transmission is greatly accelerated. Under the constraint of limited resources, a strategy that first applies control measures to the top 50 airports after day 13 and then soon afterwards to all other airports may result in remarkable containment effectiveness.

In this research article, we have demonstrated the ability of tracking these two biomarkers in passive human sweat over a workday period (8 h) for 10 human subjects in conjunction with their macronutrient consumption. The validation of the WATCH sensor performance was carried out via standard reference methods such as Luminex and ELISA This is a first demonstration of a passive sweat sensing technology that can detect interrelated dual metabolites, cortisol, and glucose, on a single sensing platform. The significance of detecting the two biomarkers simultaneously is that capturing the body's metabolic and endocrinal responses to dietary triggers can lead to improved lifestyle management. For sweat cortisol, we achieved a detection limit of 1 ng/ml (range ∼1–12.5 ng/ml) with Pearson's “r” of 0.897 in reference studies and 0.868 in WATCH studies. Similarly, for sweat glucose, we achieved a detection limit of 1 mg/dl (range ∼ 1–11 mg/dl) with Pearson's “r” of 0.968 in reference studies and 0.947 in WATCH studies, respectively.

METHODS: We undertook a secondary analysis of 13977 adults admitted to hospital with suspected COVID-19 and included in the Pandemic Respiratory Infection Emergency System Triage (PRIEST) study. We recorded presenting characteristics and outcomes (death or organ support) up to 30 days. We categorised patients as early DNACPR (before or on the day of admission) or late/no DNACPR (no DNACPR or occurring after the day of admission). We undertook descriptive analysis comparing these groups and multivariable analysis to identify independent predictors of early DNACPR. RESULTS: We excluded 1249 with missing DNACPR data, and identified 3929/12748 (31%) with an early DNACPR decision. They had higher mortality (40.7% v 13.1%) and lower use of any organ support (11.6% v 15.7%), but received a range of organ support interventions, with some being used at rates comparable to those with late or no DNACPR (e.g. non-invasive ventilation 4.4% v 3.5%). On multivariable analysis, older age (p < 0.001), active malignancy (p < 0.001), chronic lung disease (p < 0.001), limited performance status (p < 0.001), and abnormal physiological variables were associated with increased recording of early DNACPR. Asian ethnicity was associated with reduced recording of early DNACPR (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Early DNACPR decisions were associated with recognised predictors of adverse outcome, and were inversely associated with Asian ethnicity. Most people with an early DNACPR decision survived to 30 days and many received potentially life-saving interventions.

Among women who completed the survey, 69.0% (1050/1518) indicated the first wave of the pandemic affected their personal habits, 61.0% (689/1131) were affected in their work and 40.0% (632/1573) reported impaired relations with healthcare services (different denominators correspond to the number of participants who answered the question). 36.8% (110/299) of women reported an impact of the pandemic on their current pregnancy experience or breastfeeding experience (8.2%, 46/555). Overall, 11.6% (170/1467) of participants who completed the validated screening tests for mental health symptoms (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7, Perceived Stress Scale) presented a score compatible with symptoms of major depression, severe anxiety or high perceived stress, which is higher than in the pre-pandemic period according to literature. Risk factors independently associated with impaired mental health were being hospitalized, having symptoms of COVID-19, living with a person with COVID-19 symptoms, having comorbidities, having experienced reduced healthcare services, having restricted usual activities and being a housewife. Protective factors independently associated were a high level of education and living with a partner. Our findings suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic might have significantly affected the well-being and mental health of pregnant and breastfeeding women, directly in the case of exposure, and indirectly as a result of the potential modifications in their life habits and in healthcare facilities.","Lambelet, Valentine; Ceulemans, Michael; Nordeng, Hedvig; Favre, Guillaume; Horsch, Antje; Stojanov, Milos; Winterfeld, Ursula; Baud, David; Panchaud, Alice; Pomar, Léo",Swiss Med Wkly,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34546015/; https://doi.org/10.4414/smw.2021.w30009,288
646288,Risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection and course of COVID-19 disease in patients with IBD in the Veterans Affair Healthcare System,2021-03-22,"Background: Previous studies have shown that COVID-19 In-Hospital Fatality Rate (IHFR) varies between regions and has been diminishing over time. It is believed that the continuous improvement in the treatment of patients, age group of hospitalized, and the availability of hospital resources might be affecting the temporal and regional variation of IHFR. In this study, we explored how the IHFR varied along time and among age groups and federative states in Brazil. In addition, we also assessed the relationship between hospital structure availability and peaks of IHFR. Methods: A retrospective analysis of all COVID-19 hospitalizations with confirmed outcomes in 21 states between March 01 and September 22, 2020 (N=345,281) was done. We fit GLM binomial models with additive and interaction effects between age groups, epidemiological weeks, and states. We also evaluated the association between the modeled peak of IHFR in each state and the variables of hospital structure using the Spearman rank correlation test. Results: We found that the temporal variation of the IHFR was heterogeneous among the states, and in general it followed the temporal trends in hospitalizations. In addition, the peak of IHFR was higher in states with a smaller number of doctors and intensivists, and in states in which a higher percentage of people relied on the Public Health System (SUS) for medical care. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the pressure over the healthcare system is affecting the temporal trends of IHFR in Brazil.","Portella, T. P.; Mortara, S.

In addition to being regarded as an NADPH oxidase (NOX) inhibitor, apocynin (APO) exhibits an anti-apoptotic effect in various cells. The present study aimed to identify the protective role of apocynin in ER stress-mediated EC apoptosis and the underlying mechanisms. We found that ER stress resulted in a significant increase in c-Jun N-terminal kinase phosphorylation, and elicited caspase 3 cleavage and apoptosis. However, apocynin obviously attenuated EC apoptosis and this effect was partly dependent on ER stress sensor inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α). Importantly, apocynin upregulated IRE1α expression in both protein and mRNA levels and promoted the pro-survival XBP1 splicing. Our results suggest that apocynin protects ECs against ER stress-induced apoptosis via IRE1α involvement. These findings may provide a novel mechanistic explanation for the anti-apoptotic effect of apocynin in ER stress.","Wu, Jie; Zhang, Weijin; Liu, Xiaohui; Wu, Lili; He, Guangting; Li, Peixin; Guo, Xiaohua; Chen, Zhongqing; Huang, Qiaobing",Mol Cell Biochem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29696609/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11010-018-3362-4,288

In addition, lockdowns related to COVID‐19 have led to a significant economic crisis. We aimed to study how the pandemic and related economic threats have impacted support for anti‐democratic political systems. METHOD: We analyzed data from a quota panel of the Italian adult population (N = 1,195), surveyed once before and once during the pandemic. RESULTS: A hierarchical regression model showed that exposure to COVID‐19 and perceived economic insecurity were associated with support for anti‐democratic political systems, independent of participants’ predispositions toward a strong leader. CONCLUSION: An authoritarian personality is not a necessary precondition for individual anti‐democracy: when facing severe personal threats, anyone could restore a subjective sense of control over the social world by becoming anti‐democratic, independent of their initial predisposition to support anti‐democratic political systems.","Roccato, Michele; Cavazza, Nicoletta; Colloca, Pasquale; Russo, Silvia",Soc Sci Q,https://doi.org/10.1111/ssqu.12865; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33041377/,288

However, a small number of children develop features of substantial inflammation temporarily related to the COVID-19 also called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) or pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS), clinically similar to Kawasaki disease, toxic shock syndrome and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). It is well-known that genetic pre-disposition plays an important role in virally-triggered diseases such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated HLH, while this has not yet been established for patients with MIS-C. Here we describe a male patient fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of MIS-C, who was initially treated according to current consensus guidelines. Presence of hypofibrinogenemia, normal lymphocyte counts and C-reactive protein, but substantial hyperferritinemia distinguish this patient from others with MIS-C. The clinical course following initial presentation with acute respiratory distress syndrome was marked by fatal liver failure in the context of EBV-associated HLH despite treatment with steroids, intravenous immunoglobulins, interleukin (IL)-1 receptor blockade and eventually HLH-directed treatment. X-linked lymphoproliferative disease type 1 (XLP1), a subtype of primary HLH was diagnosed in this patient post-mortem. This case report highlights the importance of including HLH in the differential diagnosis in MIS-C with severe disease course to allow specific, risk-adapted treatment and genetic counseling.","Prader, Seraina; Ritz, Nicole; Baleydier, Frédéric; Andre, Maya C.; Stähli, Noémie; Schmid, Kevin; Schmid, Hanna; Woerner, Andreas; Diesch, Tamara; Meyer Sauteur, Patrick M.; Trück, Johannes; Gebistorf, Fabienne; Opitz, Lennart; Killian, Michael P.; Marchetti, Tommaso; Vavassori, Stefano; Blanchard-Rohner, Géraldine; Mc Lin, Valerie; Grazioli, Serge; Pachlopnik Schmid, Jana",Front Pediatr,https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2021.691024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34414143/,288

The CRISPR/Cas system is guided by a gRNA to cleave a specific DNA cassette, which can be developed into a highly efficient programable phage defense system. In this work, we constructed a CRISPR/Cas system targeting multiple positions on the genome of T7 phage and found that the system increased the BL21’s defense ability against phage infection. Furthermore, the targeted loci on phage genome played a critical role. For better control of expression of CRISPR/Cas9, various modes were tested, and the OD of the optimized strain BL21(pT7cas9, pT7-3gRNA, prfp) after 4 h of phage infection was significantly improved, reaching 2.0, which was similar to the control culture without phage infection. Although at later time points, the defensive ability of CRISPR/Cas9 systems were not as obvious as that at early time points. The viable cell count of the engineered strain in the presence of phage was only one order of magnitude lower than that of the strain with no infection, which further demonstrated the effectiveness of the CRISPR/Cas9 phage defense system. Finally, the engineered BL21 strain under phage attack expressed RFP protein at about 60% of the un-infected control, which was significantly higher than the parent BL21. In this work, we successfully constructed a programable CRISPR/Cas9 system to increase the ability of E. coli BL21’s to defend against phage infection, and created a resistant protein expression host. This work provides a simple and feasible strategy for protecting industrial E. coli strains against phage infection.","Liu, Li; Zhao, Dongdong; Ye, Lijun; Zhan, Tao; Xiong, Bin; Hu, Muzi; Bi, Changhao; Zhang, Xueli",Microb Cell Fact,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32620105/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12934-020-01393-2,288

649352,"Post‐SARS sickness syndrome manifestations and endocrinopathy: how, why, and so what?",2005-09-03,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a respiratory illness caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was declared a pandemic in March 2020, and has caused more than 600,000 deaths in the United States at the time of this report. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) or chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy recipients have a higher risk of mortality with COVID-19 owing to profound immune dysregulation. In this study, we investigated the impact of SARS-CoV-2 in HCT/CAR-T therapy recipients. This single-center prospective study included all (n = 58) adult HCT/CAR-T recipients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 at the University of Kansas Medical Center between March 2020 and May 2021. Baseline and disease-related characteristics were ascertained from medical records. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 21 (IBM, Armonk, NY). Bivariate analyses, using the chi-square and t-test, and logistic regression analyses were conducted. The study included 58 HCT/CAR-T patients who acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection, including recipients of allogeneic HCT (n = 32), autologous HCT (n = 23), and CAR-T therapy (n = 3). The median patient age was 58 years (range, 24 to 77 years), and 64% were males. The median time from HCT/CAR-T therapy to SARS-CoV-2 infection was 17.7 months (range, 0.2 to 201.9 months), and 22% of the patients acquired SARS-CoV-2 within the first 100 days post-HCT/CAR-T therapy. The primary hematologic disorders were plasma cell (36%), myeloid (38%), and lymphoid (26%) malignancies. Myeloablative conditioning was performed in 62% of patients. Donors were autologous (45%), matched sibling (15%), matched unrelated (21%), and haploidentical (19%). Prior history of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), active GVHD, and current immunosuppressive therapy (IST) was noted in 22%, 31%, and 36% of patients, respectively. Concurrent infections were observed in 19%. Lymphopenia (P = .049) and high serum ferritin concentration (P = .020) were associated with mortality. COVID-19 severity was mild in 50% of the patients, moderate in 22%, and severe in 28%. Clinical findings included pneumonia or abnormal chest imaging (in 50%), hypoxia (28%), intensive care unit admission (19%), and mechanical ventilation (10%). Therapies included remdesivir (in 41%), convalescent plasma (35%), dexamethasone (22%), monoclonal antibodies (19%), and tocilizumab (3%). The median duration of viral shedding (positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR) was 7.7 weeks (range, 2 to 18.7 weeks), and 2 patients had a persistent infection for >5 months post-CAR-T therapy. After a median follow-up of 6.1 months (range, 0.5-13.6 months), the mortality rate was 16% in all patients and 28% in allogeneic HCT recipients. Among 9 patients who died, the median survival after SARS-CoV-2 infection was 23 days (range, 14 to 140 days). In survivors with moderate-severe COVID-19, the median time to recovery was 4.2 weeks (range, 1.1 to 24.7 weeks). Among allogeneic HCT recipients, 5 (16%) developed subsequent pulmonary chronic GVHD necessitating systemic steroids and additional IST. Significant predictors of COVID-19 severity included allogeneic HCT (odds ratio [OR], 3.6, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2 to 10.8; P = .020), history of grade II-IV acute GVHD (OR, 4.6; 95% CI, 1.10 to 18.86; P = .036) and concurrent IST (OR, 5.9; 95% CI, 1.8 to 19.8; P = .004). HCT and CAR-T cell therapy recipients are at an increased risk of moderate-severe COVID-19 pneumonia and higher mortality with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our findings confirm the need for continuing vigilance with social distancing and masks, vaccination prioritization, close monitoring, and aggressive treatment of HCT/CAR-T therapy recipients.","Mushtaq, Muhammad Umair; Shahzad, Moazzam; Chaudhary, Sibgha Gull; Luder, Mary; Ahmed, Nausheen; Abdelhakim, Haitham; Bansal, Rajat; Balusu, Ramesh; DeJarnette, Shaun; Divine, Clint; Kribs, Robert; Shune, Leyla; Singh, Anurag K.; Ganguly, Siddhartha; Abhyankar, Sunil H.; McGuirk, Joseph P.",Transplant Cell Ther,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtct.2021.07.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666636721010678?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34256172/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666636721010678,288

Patients with critically COVID-19 usually require invasive respiratory support, and the airway management is particularly important and the prognosis is poor. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 64-year-old man with an anastomotic fistula after radical treatment of esophageal cancer and right-side encapsulated pyopneumothorax was admitted with cough and dyspnea. DIAGNOSIS: The patient was diagnosed with novel coronavirus pneumonia and right-side encapsulated pyopneumothorax by pharyngeal swab nucleic acid test in combination with chest computed tomography (CT). INTERVENTIONS: The patient was treated with antibiotics, antiviral and antibacterial medications, respiratory support, expectorant nebulization, and nutritional support. But he expressed progressive deterioration. Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation were performed since the onset of the type - respiratory failure on the 13th day of admission. The patient had persistent refractory hypercapnia after mechanical ventilation. Based on the treatment mentioned above, combined with repeated bronchoalveolar lavage by using N-acetylcysteine (NAC) inhalation solution, the patients refractory hypercapnia was gradually improved. OUTCOMES: The patient was cured and discharged after being given the mechanical ventilation for 26 days as well as 46 days of hospitalization, currently is surviving well. LESSONS: : Patients with severe conditions of novel coronavirus pneumonia often encounter bacterial infection in their later illness-stages. They may suffer respiratory failure and refractory hypercapnia that is difficult to improve due to excessive mucus secretion leading to small airway obstruction. This study provided a new insight on the proper treatment severe COVID-19 patients. The use of reasonable antibiotics and symptomatic respiratory support and other treatment, timely artificial airway and repeated bronchoalveolar NAC inhalation solution lavage, expectorant and other airway management are essential for such patients.","Liu, Yan; Wang, Meifang; Luo, Guoshi; Qian, Xin; Wu, Chenglin; Zhang, Yizhong; Chen, Biyu; Leung, Elaine Lai-Han; Tang, Yijun",Medicine (Baltimore),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33080692/; https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000022577,288

The time in therapeutic range (TTR), International Normalized Ratio (INR) averages, the numbers of INR tests, and the non-adherence to INR monitoring (NIM) were compared for the pre-covid period (PCP) and the COVID-19 period (CP). Also, adherence to warfarin therapy was evaluated with a questionnaire.Results For all patients, the INR values were higher in the CP (2.47 vs 2.60, p<0.001), and the NIM percentage was higher (19.2 % vs 71.5 %, p<0.001) in the CP. The number of INR tests was lower during the CP (p<0.001).The percentage of patients with TTR≥70 % was lower during the CP (41.7 % vs 33 % p=0.017). Subgroup analysis showed that for PVP, TTR values and the percentage of patients with TTR ≥70 % were similar in both the PCP and CP periods. The questionnaire showed that for 94.1 % of respondents, the major cause of NIM in the CP was the COVID-19 pandemic. However, during the CP, adherence to warfarin medication was high (95.5 %).Conclusion Lower TTR during the COVID-19 pandemic can increase bleeding and thromboembolic cases.Therefore, patients taking warfarin should be followed more closely, and more practical ways should be considered for INR testing.","Tolga, Doğan; Fatih, Levent",Kardiologiia,https://doi.org/10.18087/cardio.2021.7.n1593; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34397342/,288

Despite the fact that a new generation of universal vaccines or anti-influenza drugs are being developed, the perfect remedy has still not been found. In this review, various strategies for using nanoparticles (NPs) to defeat influenza virus infections are presented. Several categories of NP applications are highlighted: NPs as immuno-inducing vaccines, NPs used in gene silencing approaches, bare NPs influencing influenza virus life cycle and the use of NPs for drug delivery. This rapidly growing field of anti-influenza methods based on nanotechnology is very promising. Although profound research must be conducted to fully understand and control the potential side effects of the new generation of antivirals, the presented and discussed studies show that nanotechnology methods can effectively induce the immune responses or inhibit influenza virus activity both in vitro and in vivo.

651957,The Impact of Deranged Glucose Metabolism and Diabetes in The Pathogenesis and Prognosis of The Novel Sars-Cov-2: A Systematic Review of Literature.,2021-08-05,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Reindeer are an important wild and domesticated species of the Arctic, Northern Europe, Siberia and North America. As reindeer have developed various strategies to adapt to extreme environments, this makes them an interesting species for studies into diversity of immune and metabolic functions in the animal kingdom. Importantly, while reindeer carry natural infections caused by viruses (including coronaviruses), bacteria and parasites, they can also act as carriers for transmitting such diseases to other animals and humans, so called zoonosis. Reindeer are also affected by chronic wasting disease, a neuronal disease caused by prions, similar to scrapie in sheep, mad cows disease in cattle and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans. The current study assessed a specific protein modification called deimination/citrullination, which can change how proteins function and allow them to take on different roles in health and disease processes. Profiling of deiminated proteins in reindeer showed that many important pathways for immune defenses, prion diseases and metabolism are enriched in deiminated proteins, both in plasma, as well as in plasma extracellular vesicles. This study provides a platform for the development of novel biomarkers to assess wild life health status and factors relating to zoonotic disease. ABSTRACT: The reindeer (caribou) Rangifer tarandus is a Cervidae in the order Artiodactyla. Reindeer are sedentary and migratory populations with circumpolar distribution in the Arctic, Northern Europe, Siberia and North America. Reindeer are an important wild and domesticated species, and have developed various adaptive strategies to extreme environments. Importantly, deer have also been identified to be putative zoonotic carriers, including for parasites, prions and coronavirus. Therefore, novel insights into immune-related markers are of considerable interest. Peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs) are a phylogenetically conserved enzyme family which causes post-translational protein deimination by converting arginine into citrulline in target proteins. This affects protein function in health and disease. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) participate in cellular communication, in physiological and pathological processes, via transfer of cargo material, and their release is partly regulated by PADs. This study assessed deiminated protein and EV profile signatures in plasma from sixteen healthy wild female reindeer, collected in Iceland during screening for parasites and chronic wasting disease. Reindeer plasma EV profiles showed a poly-dispersed distribution from 30 to 400 nm and were positive for phylogenetically conserved EV-specific markers. Deiminated proteins were isolated from whole plasma and plasma EVs, identified by proteomic analysis and protein interaction networks assessed by KEGG and GO analysis. This revealed a large number of deimination-enriched pathways for immunity and metabolism, with some differences between whole plasma and EVs. While shared KEGG pathways for whole plasma and plasma EVs included complement and coagulation pathways, KEGG pathways specific for EVs were for protein digestion and absorption, platelet activation, amoebiasis, the AGE–RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications, ECM receptor interaction, the relaxin signaling pathway and the estrogen signaling pathway. KEGG pathways specific for whole plasma were pertussis, ferroptosis, SLE, thyroid hormone synthesis, phagosome, Staphylococcus aureus infection, vitamin digestion and absorption, and prion disease. Further differences were also found between molecular function and biological processes GO pathways when comparing functional STRING networks for deiminated proteins in EVs, compared with deiminated proteins in whole plasma.

We assessed the feasibility of using text or email messages to perform surveillance for acute respiratory infections (ARIs) among staff. METHODS: From December 7, 2016 to May 7, 2017, 50 staff participants from two pLTCFs received weekly text or email requests to report the presence or absence of ARI symptoms. Those who fulfilled the ARI case definition (≥2 symptoms) had respiratory specimens collected to detect viruses by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assays. Pre- and post-surveillance respiratory specimens were collected to assess subclinical viral shedding. RESULTS: The response rate to weekly electronic messages was 93%. Twenty-one ARIs reported from 20 (40%) participants fulfilled the case definition. Respiratory viruses were detected in 29% (5/17) of specimens collected at symptom onset (influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus [CoV] 229E, rhinovirus [RV], and dual detection of CoV OC43 and bocavirus). Four participants had positive pre-surveillance (4 RV), and six had positive post-surveillance specimens (3 RV, 2 CoV NL63 and 1 adenovirus).

Preparedness means for rapid identification and prompt proper medical treatment are of need to contain the event and prevent morbidity and spreading of the disease by properly treating exposed individuals before symptoms appearance. Herein, we describe a novel, rapid, simple, specific, and sensitive method named Micro-Agar-PCR-test (MAPt), which determines antibiotic susceptibility of bio-terror pathogens, directly from environmental samples, with no need for any prior isolation, quantification, or enrichment steps. As proof of concept, we have used this approach to obtain correct therapeutic antibiotic minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for the Tier-1 select agents, Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, and Francisella tularensis, spiked in various environmental samples recapitulating potential bioterror scenarios. The method demonstrated efficiency for a broad dynamic range of bacterial concentrations, both for fast-growing as well as slow-growing bacteria and most importantly significantly shortening the time for accurate results from days to a few hours. The MAPt allows us to address bioterror agents-contaminated environmental samples, offering rational targeted prophylactic treatment, before the onset of morbidity in exposed individuals. Hence, MAPt is expected to provide data for decision-making personal for treatment regimens before the onset of symptoms in infected individuals.","Aloni-Grinstein, Ronit; Shifman, Ohad; Gur, David; Aftalion, Moshe; Rotem, Shahar",Front Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2020.592194; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33224128/,288

Wiring Affect with ReAttach (W.A.R.A.) is a brief psychological intervention aiming to decrease negative affect, that can be offered online. METHODS: We assessed the effect of remote W.A.R.A. on negative affect in 37 patients. Consequently, we compared the effect of remote W.A.R.A. versus face-to-face W.A.R.A on negative affect in a cross-sectional design. RESULTS: W.A.R.A. remote therapy provoked a significant reduction of negative affect with a large effect size (d = 3.08, p < 0.001). However, the reduction on negative affect was smaller than with W.A.R.A. face-to-face. We found a substantial difference between W.A.R.A. remote therapy and W.A.R.A. face-to-face in decrease of negative affect (d = 1.36, p < 0.001). LIMITATIONS: The major limitation of the pilot-study is the sample size of 37 patients. Besides, we designed a numeric rating scale for evaluating negative affect. We investigated the impact on negative affect by assessing “unpleasant feelings.” This conceptualization of negative affect might still be a point of discussion. CONCLUSION: The study’s findings indicated that W.A.R.A. remote therapy significantly reduced negative affect, but to a lesser extent than W.A.R.A. face-to-face. Nevertheless, W.A.R.A. remote therapy might offer a fast relief, especially when personal contact is difficult.","Weerkamp-Bartholomeus, Paula; Marazziti, Donatella; van Amelsvoort, Therese",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33519645/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.620027,288

We found widespread hesitancy and a substantial proportion of HCP did not intend to vaccinate. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of HCP, including clinical and non-clinical staff, researchers, and trainees between February 21 and March 19, 2021. The survey evaluated vaccine attitudes, beliefs, intent and acceptance. RESULTS: Overall, 3,981 (87.7%) of respondents had already received a COVID-19 vaccine or planned to get vaccinated. There were significant differences in vaccine acceptance by gender, age, race, and hospital role. Males (93.7%) were more likely than females (89.8%) to report vaccine acceptance (p<0.001). Mean age was higher among those reporting vaccine acceptance (p<0.001). Physicians and scientists showed the highest acceptance rate (97.3%), while staff in ancillary services showed the lowest acceptance rate (79.9%). Unvaccinated respondents were more likely to be females, to have refused vaccines in the past due to reasons other than illness or allergy, to care for COVID-19 patients, or to rely on themselves when making vaccination decision. Vaccine acceptance was more than twice previous intent among Black respondents, an increase from 30.8% to 73.8%, and across all hospital roles with all >80% vaccine acceptance. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of HCP were vaccinated, much higher than reporting intent before vaccine was available. However, many HCP—particularly ancillary services—are still hesitant. Feasible and effective interventions to address the hesitant, including individually-tailored education strategies are needed, or vaccine can be mandated.","Shaw, Jana; Hanley, Samantha; Stewart, Telisa; Salmon, Daniel A; Ortiz, Christine; Trief, Paula M; Asiago Reddy, Elizabeth; Morley, Christopher P; Thomas, Stephen J; Anderson, Kathryn B",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34467370/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciab731,288

The model was trained and tested on experimental data on the relative immunodominance of CTL epitopes in Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection. The method is more accurate than publicly available models. Our model predicts that only a fraction of SARS-CoV-2 epitopes that have been predicted to bind to HLA molecules is immunogenic. The immunogenic CTL epitopes across all SARS-CoV-2 proteins are predicted to provide broad population coverage, but the immunogenic epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein alone are unlikely to do so. Our model predicts that several immunogenic SARS-CoV-2 CTL epitopes are identical to those contained in low-pathogenicity coronaviruses circulating in the population. Thus, we suggest that some level of CTL immunity against COVID-19 may be present in some individuals prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Gao, Ang; Chen, Zhilin; Segal, Florencia Pereyra; Carrington, Mary; Streeck, Hendrik; Chakraborty, Arup K.; Julg, Boris",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32511339/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.14.095885,288

AIM: We describe the extent of cross-border contact tracing and its challenges. METHODS: We analysed cross-border COVID-19 contact tracing events from 3 February to 5 April 2020 using information exchanged through the European Early Warning Response System and communication with International Health Regulation national focal points. We described events by PHA, number of contacts and exposure context. RESULTS: The RKI processed 467 events, initiating contact to PHA 1,099 times (median = 1; interquartile range (IQR): 1–2) and sharing data on 5,099 contact persons. Of 327 (70%) events with known exposure context, the most commonly reported exposures were aircraft (n = 64; 20%), cruise ships (n = 24; 7%) and non-transport contexts (n = 210; 64%). Cruise ship and aircraft exposures generated more contacts with authorities (median = 10; IQR: 2–16, median = 4; IQR: 2–11) and more contact persons (median = 60; IQR: 9–269, median = 2; IQR: 1–3) than non-transport exposures (median = 1; IQR: 1–6 and median = 1; IQR: 1–2). The median time spent on contact tracing was highest for cruise ships: 5 days (IQR: 3–9). CONCLUSION: In the COVID-19 pandemic, cross-border contact tracing is considered a critical component of the outbreak response. While only a minority of international contact tracing activities were related to exposure events in transport, they contributed substantially to the workload. The numerous communications highlight the need for fast and efficient global outbreak communication channels between PHA.","Markus, Inessa; Steffen, Gyde; Lachmann, Raskit; Marquis, Adine; Schneider, Timm; Tomczyk, Sara; Koppe, Uwe; Rohde, Anna M; Schink, Susanne Barbara; Seifried, Janna; Domaszewska, Teresa; Rexroth, Ute; an der Heiden, Maria",Euro Surveill,https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.es.2021.26.10.2001236; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33706859/,288

Observations were made in 20 kindergartens and principals of another 10 kindergartens completed questionnaires. The influence of SARS was evident in all preschools, be it through teachers and students wearing masks, notices on hand washing or the provision of alcohol dispensers for hand disinfection. The outbreak impacted noticeably upon children’s routines and social exchanges. In all schools, physical contact among children and sharing of food were not allowed. Children were also prohibited from talking to their peers when they had removed their masks.

Most methods to understand housing composition are based on survey or census data, and there is currently no reproducible methodology for creating population-level household composition measures using linked administrative data. METHODS: Using existing, and more recent enhancements to the address-data linkage methods in the SAIL Databank using Residential Anonymised Linking Fields we linked individuals to properties using the anonymised Welsh Demographic Service data in the SAIL Databank. We defined households, household size, and household composition measures based on adult to child relationships, and age differences between residents to create relative age measures. RESULTS: Two relative age-based algorithms were developed and returned similar results when applied to population and household-level data, describing household composition for 3.1 million individuals within 1.2 million households in Wales. Developed methods describe binary, and count level generational household composition measures. CONCLUSIONS: Improved residential anonymised linkage field methods in SAIL have led to improved property-level data linkage, allowing the design and application of household composition measures that assign individuals to shared residences and allow the description of household composition across Wales. The reproducible methods create longitudinal, household-level composition measures at a population-level using linked administrative data. Such measures are important to help understand more detail about an individual’s home and area environment and how that may affect the health and wellbeing of the individual, other residents, and potentially into the wider community.","Johnson, Rhodri D.; Griffiths, Lucy J.; Hollinghurst, Joe P.; Akbari, Ashley; Lee, Alexandra; Thompson, Daniel A.; Lyons, Ronan A.; Fry, Richard",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0248195; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33780469/,288

However, considerable geographical disparities in the distribution of COVID-19 incidence existed among different cities. In this study, we aimed to explore the effect of sociodemographic factors on COVID-19 incidence of 342 cities in China from a geographic perspective. METHODS: Official surveillance data about the COVID-19 and sociodemographic information in China’s 342 cities were collected. Local geographically weighted Poisson regression (GWPR) model and traditional generalized linear models (GLM) Poisson regression model were compared for optimal analysis. RESULTS: Compared to that of the GLM Poisson regression model, a significantly lower corrected Akaike Information Criteria (AICc) was reported in the GWPR model (61953.0 in GLM vs. 43218.9 in GWPR). Spatial auto-correlation of residuals was not found in the GWPR model (global Moran’s I = − 0.005, p = 0.468), inferring the capture of the spatial auto-correlation by the GWPR model. Cities with a higher gross domestic product (GDP), limited health resources, and shorter distance to Wuhan, were at a higher risk for COVID-19. Furthermore, with the exception of some southeastern cities, as population density increased, the incidence of COVID-19 decreased. CONCLUSIONS: There are potential effects of the sociodemographic factors on the COVID-19 incidence.

661383,"International Circumpolar Surveillance, An Arctic Network for the Surveillance of Infectious Diseases",2008-01-11,"Zoonotic coronavirus disease (COVID) has emerged in the past two decades and caused a pandemic that has produced a significant universal health alarm. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV) emerged in 2002 and 2012, respectively, provoking severe lower respiratory infection and deadly pneumonia. COVID-19 is a severe respiratory disease caused by the new strain of novel CoV (SARS-CoV-2). The zoonotic aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are highlighted in this article. COVID-19 has rapidly become a pandemic and has spread and infected millions of people worldwide. As of November 19, 2020, the date of submitting this review, the total CoV cases, deaths, and recovered patients are 56,828,218, 1,359,320, and 39,548,923, respectively. In conclusion, COVID-19 has particularly altered the opinion of the significance of zoonotic diseases and their animal origins and the intermediate reservoirs, which may be unknown wild animals. Genetically, the SARS-CoV-2 is related to the SARS-like bat CoVs and shares 85% identity with the SARS-CoV that is derived from the SARS-like bat CoVs. However, the virus is related to a lesser extent to the MERS-CoV. The SARS-CoV-2 uses the same receptor-binding domain receptor of the SARS-CoV – the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; conversely, DPP4 (CD26). It has not been proved that the MERS-CoVs primary receptor is the receptor of the SARS-CoV-2.","Al-Salihi, Karima A.; Khalaf, Jenan Mahmood",Vet World,https://doi.org/10.14202/vetworld.2021.190-199; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33642804/,288
661405,"Diagnostic Imaging in the Newborn, Child and Adolescent Infected with SARS-CoV-2: is there a Realistic Alternative to Lung-HRCT and Chest X-rays ? A Systematic Review of the Literature",2021-07-24,"In December 2019, the EU announced the European Green Deal (EGD) to create a climate-neutral continent by 2050. Accordingly, the EU Emission Trading System (ETS) will be revised to maintain economic growth against possible losses in competitiveness, leading to “carbon leakage.” Carbon border adjustment (CBA) is one of the mechanisms proposed to tackle the carbon leakage problem. In this paper, we provide a first-order estimate of the potential impacts of a possible CBA across production sectors and build a dynamic, multi-sectoral applied general equilibrium (AGE) model to study the overall macroeconomic impact of the EGD on the Turkish economy. Then, we extend our analysis to document the potential benefits of a more active climate policy. The model is in the Walrasian tradition wherein aggregate supply and demand actions are simulated with the interplay of relative prices to bring equilibrium in the markets for goods, for labor, and for foreign exchange. Constructed around 24 production sectors, the model accommodates flexible, multi-level functional forms to link production activities with gaseous emissions, a government entity to maintain taxation, and public expenditures, as well as administration of environmental policy instruments, all within an open-economy macroeconomic environment. Our results suggest that the potential adverse impact of the CBA on the Turkish economy would range between 2.7 and 3.6% loss of the GDP by 2030 over the business-as-(un)usual base path. We also document that under an alternative scenario through which Turkey is modeled as an active agent in the international climate policy arena embedding decarbonization into her official macroeconomic policy agenda, she can achieve a superior pathway for national income and a reduced carbon burden.","Acar, Sevil; Aşıcı, Ahmet Atıl; Yeldan, A.

Healthcare-associated SARS-CoV-2 infection has been reported in single and multi-site hospital-based studies in England, but not nationally. METHODS: : Admission records for all hospitals in England were linked to SARS-CoV-2 national test data for the period 01/03/2020 to 31/08/2020. Case definitions were: community-onset community-acquired, first positive test <14 days pre-admission, up to day 2 of admission; hospital-onset indeterminate healthcare-associated, first positive on day 3-7; hospital-onset probable healthcare-associated, first positive on day 8-14; hospital-onset definite healthcare-associated, first positive from day 15 of admission until discharge; community-onset possible healthcare-associated, first positive test ≤14 days post-discharge. RESULTS: : One-third (34.4%, 100,859/293,204) of all laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases were linked to a hospital record. Hospital-onset probable and definite cases represented 5.3% (15,564/293,204) of all laboratory-confirmed cases and 15.4% (15,564/100,859) of laboratory-confirmed cases among hospital patients. Community-onset community-acquired and community-onset possible healthcare-associated cases represented 86.5% (253,582/293,204) and 5.1% (14,913/293,204) of all laboratory-confirmed cases, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: : Up to 1 in 6 SARS-CoV-2 infections among hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in England during the first 6 months of the pandemic could be attributed to nosocomial transmission, but these represent less than 1% of the estimated 3 million COVID-19 cases in this period.","Bhattacharya, Alex; Collin, Simon M; Stimson, James; Thelwall, Simon; Nsonwu, Olisaeloka; Gerver, Sarah; Robotham, Julie; Wilcox, Mark; Hopkins, Susan; Hope, Russell",J Infect,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445321004436?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2021.08.039; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445321004436; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34474055/,288

Our aim was to characterize the extent of loneliness in a sample of older adults living in the community and assess characteristics associated with loneliness. Design: Online cross-sectional survey between May 6 and May 19, 2020 Setting: Ontario, Canada Participants: Convenience sample of the members of a national retired educators' organization. Primary outcome measures: Self-reported loneliness, including differences between women and men. Results: 4879 respondents (71.0% women; 67.4% 65-79 years) reported that in the preceding week, 43.1% felt lonely at least some of the time, including 8.3% that felt lonely always or often. Women had increased odds of loneliness compared to men, whether living alone (adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) 1.52 [95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.13-2.04]) or with others (2.44 [95% CI 2.04-2.92]). Increasing age group decreased the odds of loneliness (aOR 0.69 [95% CI 0.59-0.81] 65-79 years and 0.50 [95% CI 0.39-0.65] 80+ years compared to <65 years). Living alone was associated with loneliness, with a greater association in men (aOR 4.26 [95% CI 3.15-5.76]) than women (aOR 2.65 [95% CI 2.26-3.11]). Other factors associated with loneliness included: fair or poor health (aOR 1.93 [95% CI 1.54-2.41]), being a caregiver (aOR 1.18 [95% CI 1.02-1.37]), receiving care (aOR 1.47 [95% CI 1.19-1.81]), high concern for the pandemic (aOR 1.55 [95% CI 1.31-1.84]), not experiencing positive effects of pandemic distancing measures (aOR 1.94 [95% CI 1.62-2.32]), and changes to daily routine (aOR 2.81 [95% CI 1.96-4.03]). Conclusions: While many older adults reported feeling lonely during COVID-19, several characteristics - such as being female and living alone - increased the odds of loneliness. These characteristics may help identify priorities for targeting interventions to reduce loneliness.","Savage, R. D.; Wu, W.; Li, J.; Lawson, A.; Bronskill, S. E.; Chamberlain, S.

To reduce transmission, a ‘lockdown’ was introduced in Ireland between March and May 2020. The aim of this study is to capture the experiences of consultant psychiatrists during lockdown and their perception of it’s impact on mental health services. METHODS: A questionnaire designed by the Royal College of Psychiatrists was adapted and circulated to consultant members of the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland following the easing of restrictions. The questionnaire assessed the perceived impact on referral rates, mental health act provision, availability of information technology (IT), consultant well-being and availability of personal protective equipment (PPE). Thematic analysis was employed to analyse free-text sections. RESULTS: Response rate was 32% (n = 197/623). Consultants reported an initial decrease/significant decrease in referrals in the first month of lockdown (68%, n = 95/140) followed by an increase/significant increase in the second month for both new (83%, n = 100/137) and previously attending patients (65%, n = 88/136). Social isolation and reduced face-to-face mental health supports were among the main reasons identified. The needs of children and older adults were highlighted. Most consultants (76%, n = 98/129) felt their working day was affected and their well-being reduced (52%, n = 61/119). The majority felt IT equipment availability was inadequate (67%, n = 88/132). Main themes identified from free-text sections were service management, relationship between patients and healthcare service and effects on consultants’ lives. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has placed increased pressure on service provision and consultant wellness. This further supports the longstanding need to increase mental health service investment.","Kelleher, E.; Geary, E. H.; Tawfik, M.; Ní Mhuircheartaigh, E.; Gavin, B.; Wall, M.; Lyne, J.

Methods We evaluated whether some specific post-mortem features are observed in these patients and if these changes are related to the presence of the virus in different organs. Complete macroscopic and microscopic autopsies were performed on different organs in 17 COVID-19 non-survivors. Presence of SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated with immunohistochemistry (IHC) in lung samples and with real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test in lung and other organs. Results Pulmonary findings revealed early-stage diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) in 15 out of 17 patients and microthrombi in small lung arteries in 11 patients. Late-stage DAD, atypical pneumocytes and/or acute pneumonia were also observed. Four lung infarcts, two acute myocardial infarctions and one ischemic enteritis were observed. There was no evidence of myocarditis, hepatitis or encephalitis. Kidney evaluation revealed the presence of hemosiderin in tubules or pigmented casts in most patients. Spongiosis and vascular congestion were the most frequently encountered brain lesions. No specific SARS-CoV-2 lesions were observed in any organ. IHC revealed positive cells with a heterogeneous distribution in the lungs of 11 of the 17 (65%) patients; RT-PCR yielded a wide distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in different tissues, with 8 patients showing viral presence in all tested organs (i.e. lung, heart, spleen, liver, colon, kidney and brain). Conclusions In conclusion, autopsies revealed a great heterogeneity of COVID-19-related organ injury and the remarkable absence of any specific viral lesions, even when RT-PCR identified the presence of the virus in many organs.","Remmelink, M.; De Mendoca, R.; D'Haene, N.; De Clercq, S.; Verocq, C.; Lebrun, L.; Lavis, P.; Racu, M.

While rich biological knowledge exists for SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV), integrating this knowledge is difficult and time consuming, since much of it is in siloed databases or in textual format. Furthermore, the data required by the research community varies drastically for different tasks - the optimal data for a machine learning task, for example, is much different from the data used to populate a browsable user interface for clinicians. To address these challenges, we created KG-COVID-19, a flexible framework that ingests and integrates biomedical data to produce knowledge graphs (KGs) for COVID-19 response.

To date, COVID-19 has caused about 935,000 deaths in more than 200 countries. The respiratory system is most affected by injuries caused by COVID-19, but other organs may be involved, including the cardiovascular system. SARS-CoV-2 penetrates host cells through the angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (ACE-2). ACE-2 is expressed not only in the lungs, but also in other organs, including the cardiovascular system. Several studies have found that a good percentage of patients with severe COVID-19 have cardiac lesions, including myocardial fibrosis, edema and pericarditis. Pathological remodeling of the extracellular matrix caused by viral infection leads to myocardial fibrotic lesions. These fibrotic scars can cause cardiac dysfunction, reducing the ejection fraction caused by the presence of stiffened myocardial matrix, or cardiac arrhythmias that cause an alteration in the electrical conduction system of the heart. These cardiac dysfunctions can cause death. It is therefore essential to identify cardiac involvement early in order to act with appropriate therapeutic treatments. In this review, we describe what is known about cardiac injury from COVID-19, highlighting effective pharmacological therapeutic solutions to combat cardiac injury, particularly cardiac fibrosis, caused by COVID-19.","Vitiello, A.; Ferrara, F.",Life Sci,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2020.118510; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991879/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0024320520312637; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024320520312637,288

AIM: To investigate the impact on COVID-19 patients complicated with hypertension who discontinued using ACEIs/ARBs. METHODS: All COVID-19 patients complicated with hypertension admitted to our isolated unit were consecutively recruited in this study. Some patients switched from ACEIs/ARBs to calcium channel blocker (CCBs) after admission, while others continued using non-ACEIs/ARBs. We compared characteristics and clinical outcomes between these two groups of patients. RESULTS: A total of 53 patients were enrolled, 27 patients switched from ACEIs/ARBs to CCBs while 26 patients continued with non-ACEIs/ARBs. After controlling potential confounding factors using the Cox proportional hazards model, hospital stay was longer in patients who discontinued ACEIs/ARBs, with a hazard ratio of 0.424 (95% confidence interval: 0.187-0.962; P = 0.040), upon discharge than patients using other anti-hypertensive drugs. A sub-group analysis showed that the effect of discontinuing use of ACEIs/ARBs was stronger in moderate cases [hazard ratio = 0.224 (95% confidence interval: 0.005-0.998; P = 0.0497)]. CONCLUSION: Patients in the discontinued ACEIs/ARBs group had longer hospital stays.

A previously unknown coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been identified as the causative agent of COVID-19. To date, there are no U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved vaccines or therapeutics available for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or associated COVID-19 disease, which has triggered a large influx of scientific efforts to develop countermeasures to control SARS-CoV-2 spread. To contribute to these efforts, we have developed an infectious cDNA clone of the SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 strain based on the use of a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC). Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 (rSARS-CoV-2) was readily rescued by transfection of the BAC into Vero E6 cells. Importantly, BAC-derived rSARS-CoV-2 exhibited growth properties and plaque sizes in cultured cells comparable to those of the natural SARS-CoV-2 isolate. Likewise, rSARS-CoV-2 showed levels of replication similar to those of the natural isolate in nasal turbinates and lungs of infected golden Syrian hamsters. This is, to our knowledge, the first BAC-based reverse genetics system for the generation of infectious rSARS-CoV-2 that displays features in vivo similar to those of a natural viral isolate. This SARS-CoV-2 BAC-based reverse genetics will facilitate studies addressing several important questions in the biology of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the identification of antivirals and development of vaccines for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated COVID-19 disease.","Ye, Chengjin; Chiem, Kevin; Park, Jun-Gyu; Oladunni, Fatai; Platt, Roy Nelson; Anderson, Tim; Almazan, Fernando; de la Torre, Juan Carlos; Martinez-Sobrido, Luis",mBio,https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.02168-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32978313/,288

The standard diagnostic methods to detect SARS-CoV-2 are PCR-based genetic assays. Antigen-antibody-based immunochromatographic assays are alternative methods of detecting this virus. Rapid diagnosis kits to detect SARS-CoV-2 are urgently needed. STUDY DESIGN: Three monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein were used to develop an antigen-antibody-based immunochromatographic kit to detect SARS-CoV-2. These assays were evaluated using nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected from patients suspected of having COVID-19. RESULTS: These assays detected recombinant SARS-CoV-2 N protein at concentrations >0.2 ng/ml within 10 minutes after protein loading, but did not detect the N proteins of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), human coronaviruses OC43 (HCoV-OC43) and 299E (HCoV-229E) and other pathogens causing respiratory infections. Nasopharyngeal swab specimens obtained 1～3, 4～9, and ≥ 10 days after symptom onset from COVID-19 patients diagnosed by RT-PCR showed positivity rates of 100%, >80%, and <30%, respectively.

664715,The renin-angiotensin system and specifically angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 as a potential therapeutic target in SARS-CoV-2 infections,2021-06-21,"BACKGROUND: Flavivirus diseases such as dengue fever (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), Zika and yellow fever represent a substantial global public health concern. Preexisting chronic conditions such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, obesity, and asthma were thought to predict risk of progression to severe infections. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to quantify the frequency of chronic comorbidities in flavivirus diseases to provide an estimate for their prevalence in severe and non-severe infections and examine whether chronic diseases contribute to the increased risk of severe viral expression. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search in PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE(R), Embase and Embase Classic and grey literature databases to identify studies reporting prevalence estimates of comorbidities in flavivirus diseases. Study quality was assessed with the risk of bias tool. Age-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were estimated for severe infection in the presence of chronic comorbidities. RESULTS: We identified 65 studies as eligible for inclusion for DENV (47 studies) and WNV (18 studies). Obesity and overweight (i.e., BMI> 25 kg/m(2), prevalence: 24.5%, 95% CI: 18.6–31.6%), hypertension (17.1%, 13.3–21.8%) and diabetes (13.3%, 9.3–18.8%) were the most prevalent comorbidities in DENV. However, hypertension (45.0%, 39.1–51.0%), diabetes (24.7%, 20.2–29.8%) and heart diseases (25.6%, 19.5–32.7%) were the most prevalent in WNV. ORs of severe flavivirus diseases were about 2 to 4 in infected patients with comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension and heart diseases. The small number of studies in JEV, YFV and Zika did not permit estimating the prevalence of comorbidities in these infections. CONCLUSION: Higher prevalence of chronic comorbidities was found in severe cases of flavivirus diseases compared to non-severe cases. Findings of the present study may guide public health practitioners and clinicians to evaluate infection severity based on the presence of comorbidity, a critical public health measure that may avert severe disease outcome given the current dearth of clear prevention practices for some flavivirus diseases.","Badawi, Alaa; Velummailum, Russanthy; Ryoo, Seung Gwan; Senthinathan, Arrani; Yaghoubi, Sahar; Vasileva, Denitsa; Ostermeier, Emma; Plishka, Mikayla; Soosaipillai, Marcel; Arora, Paul",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29990356/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0200200,288

The purpose of this study was to describe cancer caregivers’ emotional, physical, and financial strain during the COVID-19 pandemic and compared to preCOVID-19, and explore racial and ethnic variations in caregiver strain. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey using Lucid, LLC, incorporating quotas for race, ethnicity, gender and age. Caregivers had to be adults living in the USA and currently providing unpaid care to an adult cancer patient (i.e., during COVID-19) and prior to the pandemic. We assessed the caregivers’ emotional, physical, and financial strain and asked them to compare to preCOVID-19 caregiving. Analyses included descriptive and linear regression adjusting for sociodemographic and caregiving-related variables. RESULTS: A total of 285 caregivers met eligibility, and most were nonHispanic white (72.3%) and female (59.6%). Based on a scale of “1: Much lower” to “5: Much higher”, the financial, physical and emotional strain/stress experienced by caregivers compared to preCOVID-19 was, on average, 3.52 (SD: 0.82; range: 1–5) for financial strain, 3.61 (SD: 0.86; range: 1–5) for physical strain, and 3.88 (SD: 0.89; range: 1–5) for emotional stress. NonHispanic black caregivers were significantly more likely than nonHispanic white caregivers to indicate that caregiving-related financial strain was higher than preCOVID-19. Moreover, Hispanic caregivers compared to nonHispanic white caregivers reported caregiving-related emotional stress was higher than preCOVID-19. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest a need to be attentive to racial and ethnic variations in emotional and financial strain and provide targeted support in clinical care and via public policy during a public health crisis.","Longacre, Margaret L.; Miller, Melissa F.; Fang, Carolyn Y.",Support Care Cancer,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-020-05933-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33404809/,288

DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey assessing self-reported compliance and its behavioural correlates. SETTING: Internships of medical students in the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: 322 medical students of the Erasmus Medical Center were recruited over a period of 12 months during the Public Health internship, which is the final compulsory internship after an 18-month rotation schedule in all major specialities. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Behavioural factors influencing compliance to hand hygiene guidelines were measured by means of a questionnaire based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour and Social Ecological Models. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to identify the effect of including attitudes, social norms, self-efficacy, knowledge, risk perception and habit on hand hygiene compliance. RESULTS: We included 313 students in the analysis (response rate 97%). The behavioural model explained 40% of the variance in self-reported compliance (adjusted R(2)=0.40). Hand hygiene compliance was strongly influenced by attitudes (perceived outcomes of preventive actions), self-efficacy (perception of the ability to perform hand hygiene at the clinical ward) and habit, but was not associated with knowledge and risk perception. CONCLUSIONS: Targeting medical students’ behaviour should focus on the empowerment of these juniors and provide them with evidence on the health benefits of prevention, rather than increasing their factual knowledge of procedures.

One of its beneficial biological effects is the neuroprotective activity, showing preclinical activities on Alzheimer, Parkinson, and Huntington diseases, and even in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Also, myricetin has revealed other biological activities, among them as antidiabetic, anticancer, immunomodulatory, cardiovascular, analgesic and antihypertensive. However, few clinical trials have been performed using myricetin as nutraceutical. Thus, this review provides new insights on myricetin preclinical pharmacological activities, and role in selected clinical trials.","Taheri, Yasaman; Suleria, Hafiz Ansar Rasul; Martins, Natália; Sytar, Oksana; Beyatli, Ahmet; Yeskaliyeva, Balakyz; Seitimova, Gulnaz; Salehi, Bahare; Semwal, Prabhakar; Painuli, Sakshi; Kumar, Anuj; Azzini, Elena; Martorell, Miquel; Setzer, William N.; Maroyi, Alfred; Sharifi-Rad, Javad",BMC Complement Med Ther,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12906-020-03033-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32738903/,288

The purpose of the present cross-sectional study was to investigate the relationship between the change in levels of perceived psychological stress and vocal symptoms among Israeli academic college professors required to shift to synchronous online teaching during the global COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: . An online questionnaire was completed by 313 professors (156 men and 157 women) from 14 academic colleges in Israel at the end of the first week of online synchronous teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic, which was assumed to be the most burdened and stressful week of the transition. Participants provided self-reports for the current levels of psychological stress and vocal symptoms during the transition to online synchronous teaching, as well as general psychological stress and general vocal symptoms during previous periods of teaching. RESULTS: The results revealed higher levels of psychological stress but not vocal symptoms during the transition to online synchronous teaching compared with previous periods of teaching. Psychological stress during the transition to online synchronous teaching was positively associated with vocal symptoms during this period but this association was moderated by general stress. Although there was a positive association between psychological stress and vocal symptoms for individuals who reported low levels of psychological stress during previous periods of teaching, this association was especially strong for individuals who reported high levels of psychological stress during previous periods of teaching. CONCLUSIONS: . It is important to examine vocal symptoms of professors in specific contexts that are potentially stressful. The psychological stress surrounding the transition to online synchronous teaching was associated with elevated levels of vocal symptoms especially for those who reported high levels of psychological stress during previous periods of teaching. These results with professors accord with the notion that psychological stress may have a negative impact on the voice.","Besser, Avi; Lotem, Sari; Zeigler-Hill, Virgil",J Voice,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0892199720301909; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvoice.2020.05.028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32600872/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0892199720301909?v=s5,288

Among them, the most scarce information has been obtained from the P.1 variant and more data on its global presence and about its spreading dynamics are needed. Methods: Whole genome sequencing was performed prospectively on travellers arriving from Brasil and on a random selection of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases from our population. Results: In this study we report the first SARS-CoV-2 P.1 and P.2 variants exported from Brazil to Spain. The case infected with the P.1 variant, who had only stayed in Rio de Janeiro, required hospitalization. The two P.2 cases remained asymptomatic. A wider distribution for P.1 variant beyond the Brazilian Amazonia should be considered. The exportation of the P.2 variant, carrying the E484K mutation, deserves attention. Conclusion: One month after the first description of P.1 and P.2 importations from Brazil to Madrid, these variants were identified circulating in the community, in cases without a travel history, and involved in household transmissions.","Campoy, Pedro J.

667545,Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2: The First Decade,2011-11-10,"PURPOSE: The influenza vaccine is essential in reducing the influenza burden, especially among healthcare workers (HCW). Experimental studies suggest both coronaviruses and influenza viruses engage with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) and tetraspanin antibodies, and that ACE 2 tetraspanin antibodies in turn may inhibit both coronavirus and low-pathogenicity influenza A viruses (LP IAV) infections. This study aims to investigate the potential clinical association between receiving the 2019 influenza vaccine and the incidence of COVID-19 among HCW. METHODS: We designed a case–control study within a hospital setting in Iran when it became a center for treating COVID-19 patients. We collected data and calculated relevant incidence and associative measures among HCW who had received the 2019 influenza vaccine as compared to HCW who had not received the vaccine. RESULTS: Our total sample size was 261 HCW. Of 80 COVID-19 incident cases, three cases had received the influenza vaccine, while 87 of 181 controls had received the vaccine. The odds ratio (OR) and confidence interval (CI) of being vaccinated were 0.04 (95% CI: 0.01 to 0.14) among COVID-19 cases as compared to controls.

The expression level of ACE2 potentially determine the susceptibility and severity of COVID-19, it is thus of importance to understand the regulatory mechanism of ACE2 expression. Tripartite motif containing 28 (TRIM28) is known to be involved in multiple processes including antiviral restriction, endogenous retrovirus latency and immune response, it is recently reported to be co-expressed with SARS-CoV-2 receptor in type II pneumocytes; however, the roles of TRIM28 in ACE2 expression and SARS-CoV-2 cell entry remain unclear. This study showed that knockdown of TRIM28 induces ACE2 expression and increases pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 cell entry of A549 cells and primary pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells (PAEpiCs). In a co-culture model of NK cells and lung epithelial cells, our results demonstrated that NK cells inhibit TRIM28 and promote ACE2 expression in lung epithelial cells, which was partially reversed by depletion of interleukin-2 and blocking of granzyme B in the co-culture medium. Furthermore, TRIM28 knockdown enhanced interferon-γ (IFN-γ)- induced ACE2 expression through a mechanism involving upregulating IFN-γ receptor 2 (IFNGR2) in both A549 and PAEpiCs. The upregulated ACE2 induced by TRIM28 knockdown and co-culture of NK cells was partially reversed by dexamethasone in A549 cells. Our study identified TRIM28 as a novel regulator of ACE2 expression and SARS-CoV-2 cell entry.","Wang, Yinfang; Fan, Yingzhe; Huang, Yitong; Du, Tao; Liu, Zongjun; Huang, Dekui; Wang, Ying; Wang, Nanping; Zhang, Peng",Cell Signal,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0898656821001534; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cellsig.2021.110064; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34146659/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0898656821001534,288

In the study, higher values of new haematological parameters were observed in individuals with psoriasis than in healthy controls. A higher EIP value was noted in the group of individuals with plaque psoriasis than in the group of individuals with psoriatic arthritis.

Few studies have evaluated COVID-19-related racial/ethnic disparities in radiology. PURPOSE: To evaluate whether Non-White minority patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 infection presented with increased severity on admission CXR compared with White/Non-Hispanic patients. METHODS: Single-institution, retrospective cohort study approved by the IRB. Patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 infection (3/27/20-4/10/20) were identified using the electronic medical record (EMR) (n=326, mean age: 59 years (SD: 17 years), M:F (188:138). Primary outcome was severity of lung disease on admission CXR, measured by modified Radiographic Assessment of Lung Edema (mRALE) score. Secondary outcome was a composite adverse clinical outcome of intubation, ICU admission, or death. Primary exposure was racial/ethnic category: White/Non-Hispanic versus Non-White [i.e., Hispanic, Black, Asian, Other]. Multivariable linear regression analyses were performed to evaluate the association between mRALE scores and race/ethnicity. RESULTS: Non-White patients had significantly higher mRALE scores (median 6.1, 95% CI 5.4–6.7) compared with White/Non-Hispanic patients (median 4.2, 95% CI 3.6–4.9) (unadjusted average difference 1.8, 95% CI 0.9–2.8, p<0.01). For both White (Adjusted HR, 1.3, 95%CI 1.2-1.4, p<0.001) and Non-White patients (Adjusted HR 1.2, 95%CI 1.1-1.3, p<0.001), increasing mRALE scores were associated with a higher likelihood of experiencing composite adverse outcome with no evidence of interaction (p = 0.16). Multivariable linear regression analyses demonstrated that Non-White patients presented with higher mRALE scores on admission CXR versus White/Non-Hispanic patients (adjusted average difference 1.6, 95% CI 0.5–2.7, p<0.01). Adjustment for hypothesized mediators revealed that the association between race/ethnicity and mRALE scores was mediated by limited English proficiency (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Non-White patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection were more likely to present with higher severity of disease on admission CXR than White/Non-Hispanic patients, and increased severity was associated with worse outcomes for all patients.","Joseph, Nicholos P.; Reid, Nicholas J.; Som, Avik; Li, Matthew D; Hyle, Emily P.; Dugdale, Caitlin M.; Lang, Min; Betancourt, Joseph R.; Deng, Francis; Mendoza, Dexter P.; Little, Brent P.; Narayan, Anand K.; Flores, Efren J.",Radiology,https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.2020202602; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32673191/,288

Italy was the first of many other western countries to implement extended containment measures. Health workers and others employed in essential sectors have continued their activity, reporting high infection rate with many fatalities. The epidemiological trend highlighted the importance of work as a substantial factor to consider both when implementing strategies aimed at containing the pandemic and shaping the lockdown mitigation strategy required for sustained economic recovery. To support the decision-making process, we have developed a strategy to predict the risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2 in the workplace based on the analysis of the working process and proximity between employees; risk of infection connected to the type of activity; involvement of third parties in the working processes and risk of social aggregation. We applied this approach to outline a risk index for each economic activity sector, with different levels of detail, also considering the impact on mobility of the working population. This method was implemented into the national epidemiological surveillance model in order to estimate the impact of re-activation of specific activities on the reproduction number. It has also been adopted by the national scientific committee set up by the Italian Government for action-oriented policy advice on the COVID-19 emergency in the post lockdown phase. This approach may play a key role for public health if associated with measures for risk mitigation in enterprises through strategies of business process re-engineering. Furthermore, it will make a contribution to reconsidering the organization of work, including also innovation and fostering the integration with the national occupational safety and health (OSH) system.","Iavicoli, Sergio; Boccuni, Fabio; Buresti, Giuliana; Gagliardi, Diana; Persechino, Benedetta; Valenti, Antonio; Rondinone, Bruna Maria",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33740016/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0248874,288

This article uses China UnionPay transaction data and takes Hubei, the worst-hit region by COVID-19 in China, as an example, to conduct empirical analysis using the generalized method of moments (GMM) of the impact of current urbanization patterns on the spread of the epidemic and economic recovery from the perspectives of time, industry, and regional differences. The study found that during the different stages of COVID-19, including discovery, outbreak, and subsidence, the overall impact of urbanization on the economy in Hubei Province was first positive, then became negative, and finally gradually increased. This process had significant industrial and urban heterogeneity, which was mainly manifested in losses in tourism and catering industries that were significantly greater than those in the audio-visual entertainment and digital office industries. Similarly, the recovery speed of large cities was lower than that of small and medium-sized cities. The main reason for these differences is that the one-sided problem of urbanization is more obvious in areas with higher urbanization rates. COVID-19 has drawn attention to the development of urbanization in the future, that is, the development path of one-sided economic resource agglomeration and scale expansion should be abandoned, with greater attention paid to the improvement of service functions and the development of amenities.

676369,Association between SARS-Cov-2 infection during pregnancy and adverse pregnancy outcomes: a re-analysis of data from Wei et al. (2021).,2021-06-25,"The development of high-throughput molecular technologies and associated bioinformatics has dramatically changed the capacities of scientists to produce, handle, and analyze large amounts of genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data. A clear example of this step-change is represented by the amount of DNA sequence data that can be now produced using next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms. Similarly, recent improvements in protein and peptide separation efficiencies and highly accurate mass spectrometry have promoted the identification and quantification of proteins in a given sample. These advancements in biotechnology have increasingly been applied to the study of animal infectious diseases and are beginning to revolutionize the way that biological and evolutionary processes can be studied at the molecular level. Studies have demonstrated the value of NGS technologies for molecular characterization, ranging from metagenomic characterization of unknown pathogens or microbial communities to molecular epidemiology and evolution of viral quasispecies. Moreover, high-throughput technologies now allow detailed studies of host-pathogen interactions at the level of their genomes (genomics), transcriptomes (transcriptomics), or proteomes (proteomics). Ultimately, the interaction between pathogen and host biological networks can be questioned by analytically integrating these levels (integrative OMICS and systems biology). The application of high-throughput biotechnology platforms in these fields and their typical low-cost per information content has revolutionized the resolution with which these processes can now be studied. The aim of this chapter is to provide a current and prospective view on the opportunities and challenges associated with the application of massive parallel sequencing technologies to veterinary medicine, with particular focus on applications that have a potential impact on disease control and management.","Van Borm, Steven; Belák, Sándor; Freimanis, Graham; Fusaro, Alice; Granberg, Fredrik; Höper, Dirk; King, Donald P.; Monne, Isabella; Orton, Richard; Rosseel, Toon",Veterinary Infection Biology: Molecular Diagnostics and High-Throughput Strategies,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-2004-4_30; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25399113/,288

At the same time, it is also aimed to decide the best resource allocation in cargo services and to show the differences between both periods. This is the first study using the FIPIA method in determining the service quality priorities of consumers using cargo service. A total of 723 participants responded to the questionnaire consisting of 341 participants before the Covid-19 and 382 participants during the Covid-19 period. This study also examined whether there is a relationship between the sectors most frequently used in cargo service in both periods and service quality priorities and found the differences in consumers' sectors most frequently. According to data found in the study, the application of promotion and courteousness, and politeness of the personnel had the highest value in all service quality priorities before the Covid-19 outbreak. According to results, “evaluation of customer complaints in a short time” and “fast delivery” had the highest value in all service quality priorities after the Covid-19 outbreak. Evaluation of customer complaints in a short time and fast delivery had high importance values while performance and impact had relatively low importance, presenting a need to concentrate on these three-service qualities.","Özden, Aybike Tuba; Celik, Erkan",Transp Policy (Oxf),https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tranpol.2021.04.025; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0967070X21001281; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34511749/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967070X21001281,288

METHODS: Single center, consecutive case series with historical controls. Patients presenting with primary RRD during the first Austrian SARS-CoV-2 lockdown (March 16(th)–May 3(rd) 2020) and a corresponding control group consisting of the same time period of the preceding 3 years. RESULTS: The mean number of patients with RD in the reference group (RG) was 22 (± 1) and in the lockdown group (LG) 15. Median total delay, defined as onset of symptoms until surgery, in the RG was 5 (lower quartile: 3.0; upper quartile: 8.0) compared to 7 (3.0; 12.0) days in the LG, (p = 0.740). During the lockdown 67% of patients were referred from an external ophthalmologist compared to 52% in the RG, (p = 0.395). 34% of patients in the RG presented with an attached macula compared to 33% in the LG (p = 0.597). PVR was present in 49% of cases in the RG compared to 73% in the LG. Single surgery success (SSS) rates were lower in the LG (73.3%) compared to the RG (85.3%), (p = 0.275). CONCLUSION: Patients with RRD during the SARS-CoV-2 lockdown presented and were treated within acceptable time limits, showed the same macula-on ratios but a higher PVR rate and a tendency towards worse SSS rates compared to the time period of the preceding 3 years.","Schranz, Markus; Georgopoulos, Michael; Sacu, Stefan; Reumueller, Adrian; Reiter, Gregor S.; Mylonas, Georgios; Schmidt-Erfurth, Ursula; Pollreisz, Andreas",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0248010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33684142/,288

Methods. The study group included 97 children hospitalized due to pneumonia at the Karol Jonscher Teaching Hospital in Poznań, in whom multiplex real-time PCR tests (FTD respiratory pathogens 33; fast-track diagnostics) were used. Results. Positive test results of the test were achieved in 74 patients (76.3%). The average age in the group was 56 months. Viruses were detected in 61 samples (82% of all positive results); bacterial factors were found in 29 samples (39% of all positive results).

677912,Response to recent commentaries regarding the involvement of angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and renin‐angiotensin system blockers in SARS‐CoV‐2 infections,2020-04-17,"BACKGROUND: Liberal PCR testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is key to contain the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Combined multi-sample testing in pools instead of single tests might enhance laboratory capacity and reduce costs, especially in low- and middle-income countries. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study was to assess the value of a simple questionnaire to guide and further improve pooling strategies for SARS-CoV-2 laboratory testing. METHODS: Pharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 testing were obtained from healthcare and police staff, hospital inpatients, and nursing home residents in the southwestern part of Germany. We designed a simple questionnaire, which included questions pertaining to a suggestive clinical symptomatology, recent travel history, and contact with confirmed cases to stratify an individual’s pre-test probability of having contracted COVID-19. The questionnaire was adapted repeatedly in face of the unfolding pandemic in response to the evolving epidemiology and observed clinical symptomatology. Based on the response patterns, samples were either tested individually or in multi-sample pools. We compared the pool positivity rate and the number of total PCR tests required to obtain individual results between this questionnaire-based pooling strategy and randomly assembled pools. FINDINGS: Between March 11 and July 5, 2020, we processed 25,978 samples using random pooling (n = 6,012; 23.1%) or questionnaire-based pooling (n = 19,966; 76.9%). The overall prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 0.9% (n = 238). Pool positivity (14.6% vs. 1.2%) and individual SARS-CoV-2 prevalence (3.4% vs. 0.1%) were higher in the random pooling group than in the questionnaire group. The average number of PCR tests needed to obtain the individual result for one participant was 0.27 tests in the random pooling group, as compared to 0.09 in the questionnaire-based pooling group, leading to a laboratory capacity increase of 73% and 91%, respectively, as compared to single PCR testing. CONCLUSIONS: Strategies that combine pool testing with a questionnaire-based risk stratification can increase laboratory testing capacities for COVID-19 and might be important tools, particularly in resource-constrained settings.","Schneitler, Sophie; Jung, Philipp; Bub, Florian; Alhussein, Farah; Benthien, Sophia; Berger, Fabian K.; Berkó-Göttel, Barbara; Eisenbeis, Janina; Hahn, Daphne; Halfmann, Alexander; Last, Katharina; Linxweiler, Maximilian; Lohse, Stefan; Papan, Cihan; Pfuhl, Thorsten; Rissland, Jürgen; Roth, Sophie; Schlotthauer, Uwe; Utzinger, Jürg; Smola, Sigrun; Gärtner, Barbara C.; Becker, Sören L.",Annals of global health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33262937/; https://doi.org/10.5334/aogh.3126,288

Attention should be paid to equity issues related to unmet needs during the pandemic. Methods: We calculated concentration indices to identify income-related inequalities and horizontal inequity in unmet needs due to postponed and denied healthcare in people over 50 during COVID-19, using data from the Survey on Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). Results: Very few countries show significant income-related inequalities in postponed, rescheduled or denied treatments and medical appointments, usually favouring the rich. Only Estonia, Italy and Romania show a significant horizontal inequity (HI) in postponed healthcare, which apparently favours the poor. Significant pro-rich inequity in denied healthcare is found in Italy, Poland and Greece. Conclusions: Although important income-related horizontal inequity in unmet needs of European older adults during the early waves of the COVID-19 pandemic is not evident for most countries, some of them have to carefully monitor barriers to healthcare access. Delays in diagnosis and treatments may ultimately translate into adverse health outcomes, reduced quality of life and, even, widen socio-economic health inequalities among older people.","González-Touya, Marta; Stoyanova, Alexandrina; Urbanos-Garrido, Rosa M.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34501767/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18179177,288

Self-harm (SH) and suicide are its extreme effects. The aim of this study was to provide an overview of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the occurrence and clinical profile of suicide and SH in our ED. Methods: This is a cross-sectional observational study conducted in the ED of a tertiary care center. Records of all fatal and nonfatal SH patients presenting to the ED during the lockdown period (March 24-June 23, 2020; Period1), matching periods in the previous year (March 24-June 23,2019; Period 2) and 3 months period prior (December 24 2019-March 23, 2020; Period 3) was included by searching the electronic medical record (EMR) system. The prevalence and the clinical profile of the patients were compared between these three periods. Results: A total of 125 (periods 1=55, 2=38, and 3=32) suicide and SH cases were analyzed. The cases of suicide/SH had increased by 44% and 71.9% during the lockdown period in comparison to the period 2 and 3. Organophosphate poisoning was the most common mode. Females were predominant in all three periods with a mean age of 32 (95%CI: 29.3-34.7). There was a significant delay in arrival of the patients in period 1 (p-value=0.045) with increased hospital admission (p-value =0.009) and in-hospital mortality (18.2% vs 2.6 % and 3.1%) (p-value=.001). Conclusion: We found an increase in patients presenting with suicide and SH in our ED during the pandemic which is likely to reflect an increased prevalence of mental illness in the community. We hope that the result will prime all mental health care stakeholders to initiate mental health screening and intervention for the vulnerable population during this period of crisis.","Shrestha, R.; Siwakoti, S.; Singh, S.; Shrestha, A.

In this study, we present the VirusSi computational pipeline, which facilitates the rational design of siRNAs to target existing and future respiratory viruses. Mode A of VirusSi designs siRNAs against an existing virus, incorporating considerations on siRNA properties, off-target effects, viral RNA structure and viral mutations. It designs multiple siRNAs out of which the top candidate targets >99% of SARS-CoV-2 strains, and the combination of the top four siRNAs is predicted to target all SARS-CoV-2 strains. Additionally, we develop Greedy Algorithm with Redundancy (GAR) and Similarity-weighted Greedy Algorithm with Redundancy (SGAR) to support the Mode B of VirusSi, which pre-designs siRNAs against future emerging viruses based on existing viral sequences. Time-simulations using known coronavirus genomes as early as 10 years prior to the COVID-19 outbreak show that at least three SARS-CoV-2-targeting siRNAs are among the top 30 pre-designed siRNAs. Before-the-outbreak pre-design is also possible against the MERS-CoV virus and the 2009-H1N1 swine flu virus. Our data support the feasibility of pre-designing anti-viral siRNA therapeutics prior to viral outbreaks.

Therefore, in this research, we aimed to investigate the prospective association between anemia and COVID-19 outcomes in hospitalized patients in Iran. METHODS: In this prospective study, the data of 1274 consecutive patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 were statistically analyzed. All biomarkers, including hemoglobin and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels were measured using standard methods. Anemia was defined as a hemoglobin (Hb) concentration of less than 13 g/dL and 12 g/dL in males and females, respectively. Assessing the association between anemia and COVID-19 survival in hospitalized patients was our primary endpoint. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 64.43 ± 17.16 years, out of whom 615 (48.27%) were anemic subjects. Patients with anemia were significantly older (P = 0.02) and had a higher frequency of cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, kidney disease, diabetes, and cancer (P < 0.05). The frequency of death (anemic: 23.9% vs. nonanemic: 13.8%), ICU admission (anemic: 27.8% vs. nonanemic:14.71%), and ventilator requirement (anemic: 35.93% vs. nonanemic: 20.63%) were significantly higher in anemic patients than in nonanemic patients (P < 0.001). According to the results of regression analysis, after adjusting for significant covariate in the univariable model, anemia was independently associated with mortality (OR: 1.68, 95% CI: 1.10, 2.57, P = 0.01), ventilator requirement (OR: 1.74, 95% CI: 1.19, 2.54, P = 0.004), and the risk of ICU admission (OR: 2.06, 95% CI: 1.46, 2.90, P < 0.001).

SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped RNA virus, from the genus Betacoronavirus. Although few molecules have been tested and shown some efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 in humans but a safe and cost-effective attachment inhibitors are still required for the treatment of COVID-19. Natural products are gaining attention because of the large therapeutic window and potent antiviral, immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. Therefore, this study was planned to screen natural products from Ayurveda that have the potential to modulate host immune system as well as block the virus entry in host cells by interfering its interaction with cellular receptor and may be used to develop an effective and broad-spectrum strategy for the management of COVID-19 as well as other coronavirus infections in coming future. To decipher the antiviral activity of the selected natural products, molecular docking was performed. Further, the drug-likeness, pharmacokinetics and toxicity parameters of the selected natural products were determined. Docking results suggest that curcumin and nimbin exhibits highest interaction with spike glycoprotein (MolDock score − 141.36 and − 148.621 kcal/mole) and ACE2 receptor (MolDock score − 142.647 and − 140.108 kcal/mole) as compared with other selected natural products/drugs and controls. Also, the pharmacokinetics data illustrated that all selected natural products have better pharmacological properties (low molecular weight; no violation of Lipinski rule of five, good absorption profiles, oral bioavailability, good blood–brain barrier penetration, and low toxicity risk). Our study exhibited that curcumin, nimbin, withaferin A, piperine, mangiferin, thebaine, berberine, and andrographolide have significant binding affinity towards spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 receptor and may be useful as a therapeutic and/or prophylactic agent for restricting viral attachment to the host cells. However, few other natural products like resveratrol, quercetin, luteolin, naringenin, zingiberene, and gallic acid has the significant binding affinity towards ACE2 receptor only and therefore may be used for ACE2-mediated attachment inhibition of SARS-CoV-2.","Maurya, Vimal K.; Kumar, Swatantra; Prasad, Anil K.; Bhatt, Madan L.

COVID-19 patients may require transport for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes intra- or interhospital or transport from an outside hospital to a healthcare facility. Transport of critically ill or infectious patients is always challenging and involves the integration of various tasks and manpower. The adverse events have been attributed to various factors such as a multidisciplinary team and lack of appropriate communication among team members, absence of equipment, or failure during transport, apart from physiological alteration inherent to the disease of the patient. The transport of COVID-19 patients carries an additional risk of not only the disease itself but also due to the risk of its transmission to the transport team. The human-to-human transmission of the virus can occur via respiratory droplets. So, the person involved in the transport of such patients shall be at risk and warrants appropriate steps for their safety. Appropriate planning by a well-trained transport team is an essence for the safe transport of the suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. The Transport Medicine Society guidelines present consensus guidelines for the safe transport of COVID-19 patients. DISCLAIMER: These consensus guidelines are applicable for the safe transport of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 adult patients.

This review provides comprehensive knowledge about NCDs for drug delivery applications by outlining the source and rationale behind NCDs, different routes of synthesis of NCDs and the merits of adopting each method. Detailed information regarding the mechanism behind the optical properties, toxicological profile including biosafety and biodistribution of NCDs that are favourable for drug delivery are discussed. The drug delivery applications of NCDs particularly as sensing and real-time tracing probe, antimicrobial, anticancer, neurodegenerative agents are reviewed. The clinical aspects of NCDs are also reviewed as an initiative to strengthen the case of NCDs as potent drug delivery agents.","Nair, Akhila; Haponiuk, Jozef T.; Thomas, Sabu; Gopi, Sreeraj",Biomed Pharmacother,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0753332220310271; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33035830/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332220310271; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2020.110834,288

684871,Pulmonary cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA shedding in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients: Implications for the diagnosis of CMV pneumonia,2019-02-21,"[Image: see text] There have been more than 2.2 million confirmed cases and over 120 000 deaths from the human coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), in the United States alone. However, there is currently a lack of proven effective medications against COVID-19. Drug repurposing offers a promising route for the development of prevention and treatment strategies for COVID-19. This study reports an integrative, network-based deep-learning methodology to identify repurposable drugs for COVID-19 (termed CoV-KGE). Specifically, we built a comprehensive knowledge graph that includes 15 million edges across 39 types of relationships connecting drugs, diseases, proteins/genes, pathways, and expression from a large scientific corpus of 24 million PubMed publications. Using Amazon’s AWS computing resources and a network-based, deep-learning framework, we identified 41 repurposable drugs (including dexamethasone, indomethacin, niclosamide, and toremifene) whose therapeutic associations with COVID-19 were validated by transcriptomic and proteomics data in SARS-CoV-2-infected human cells and data from ongoing clinical trials. Whereas this study by no means recommends specific drugs, it demonstrates a powerful deep-learning methodology to prioritize existing drugs for further investigation, which holds the potential to accelerate therapeutic development for COVID-19.","Zeng, Xiangxiang; Song, Xiang; Ma, Tengfei; Pan, Xiaoqin; Zhou, Yadi; Hou, Yuan; Zhang, Zheng; Li, Kenli; Karypis, George; Cheng, Feixiong",J Proteome Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32654489/; https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00316,288

The clinical importance of HBoV infection remains unclear. This report describes the clinical features and molecular phylogeny of HBoV isolates in children with acute respiratory infections. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were obtained from 1,528 children with acute respiratory infections between 2010 and 2011. Respiratory samples were screened for HBoV by multiplex PCR. A phylogenetic analysis of the HBoV VP1/VP2 gene was also undertaken. HBoV was detected in 187 (12.2%) of the 1,528 patients with a peak incidence of infection observed in patients aged 12–24 months. Coinfection with other respiratory viruses was observed in 107 (57.2%) of the HBoV‐positive children. The peak of HBoV activity occurred during the month of June in both 2010 and 2011. A higher previous history of wheezing (P = 0.016), a higher frequency of chest retraction (P < 0.001) and wheezing (P = 0.022), a higher respiratory symptom score (P = 0.002), and a longer duration of hospital stay (P = 0.021) were observed in HBoV‐positive children compared with the HBoV‐negative group. Phylogenetic analysis showed all 187 HBoV‐positive isolates were identified as HBoV 1, indicating minimal sequence variations among the isolates. A single lineage of HBoV 1 was found to have circulated in children with acute respiratory infections between 2010 and 2011 and was associated with several clinical characteristics including age, seasonality, and clinical severity with retraction, wheezing, and longer hospitalization. The clinical relevance of the minimal sequence variations of HBoV remains to be determined. J. Med. Virol. 86:2011–2018, 2014. © 2014 The Authors.

The same serologic reagents were applied to nasopharyngeal secretion cells obtained from 106 infants and children hospitalized with respiratory tract disease and apparently not infected with conventional respiratory viruses. No coronavirus infections were detected by this method. It appears that coronavirus OC43 or 229E infections were not common in children in Tyneside hospitals during the period of study.

WBC treatment usually requires participation in a dozen of 3-min long sessions. But compliance is considered difficult due to possible cold-induced unpleasant sensations. Based on hedonic psychology assumptions, ratings of pleasure-displeasure experienced during a taks or activity may be important to understand individual differences in attendance. Methods Two hundred fifty nine customers from two French cryocenters took the Feeling Scale immediately after their first WBC session. Results End affect appeared to be negatively valenced (M = -1.85, SD = 1.38, 95% confidence interval: -2.02 to -1.68). Additional statistical analyses revealed a moderating influence of past experience, in women only. Similarly, BMI was found to be negatively associated with displeasure in women, but not in men.

Years of research into the role of RAS have provided the necessary data to confirm that the role of RAS is very complex and not limited to the cardiovascular system. The presence of individual elements of the renin-angiotensin (RA) system allows to control many processes, ranging from the memorization to pro-cancer processes. Maintaining the proportions between the individual axes of the RA system allows for achieving a balance, often called homeostasis. Thus, any disturbance in the expression or activity of individual RAS elements leads to pathophysiological processes.","Ziaja, Maksymilian; Urbanek, Kinga Anna; Kowalska, Karolina; Piastowska-Ciesielska, Agnieszka Wanda",Cells,https://doi.org/10.3390/cells10020381; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33673178/,288

Here we show that D614G was more infectious than the ancestral form on human lung cells, colon cells, and on cells rendered permissive by ectopic expression of human ACE2 or of ACE2 orthologs from various mammals, including Chinese rufous horseshoe bat and Malayan pangolin. D614G did not alter S protein synthesis, processing, or incorporation into SARS-CoV-2 particles, but D614G affinity for ACE2 was reduced due to a faster dissociation rate. Assessment of the S protein trimer by cryo-electron microscopy showed that D614G disrupts an interprotomer contact, and that the conformation is shifted towards an ACE2 binding-competent state, which is modeled to be on pathway for virion membrane fusion with target cells. Consistent with this more open conformation, neutralization potency of antibodies targeting the S protein receptor-binding domain was not attenuated.","Yurkovetskiy, Leonid; Wang, Xue; Pascal, Kristen E.; Tomkins-Tinch, Christopher; Nyalile, Thomas; Wang, Yetao; Baum, Alina; Diehl, William E.; Dauphin, Ann; Carbone, Claudia; Veinotte, Kristen; Egri, Shawn B.; Schaffner, Stephen F.; Lemieux, Jacob E.; Munro, James; Rafique, Ashique; Barve, Abhi; Sabeti, Pardis C.; Kyratsous, Christos A.; Dudkina, Natalya; Shen, Kuang; Luban, Jeremy",Cell,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0092867420312290; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.09.032; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991842/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867420312290?v=s5,288
690187,SEQUENTIAL ORGAN FAILURE ASSESSMENT SCORE IN PATIENTS INFECTED WITH SARS COV-2,2020-10-31,"Remyelination is the phenomenon by which new myelin sheaths are generated around axons in the adult central nervous system (CNS). This follows the pathological loss of myelin in diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS). Remyelination can restore conduction properties to axons (thereby restoring neurological function) and is increasingly believed to exert a neuroprotective role on axons. Remyelination occurs in many MS lesions but becomes increasingly incomplete/inadequate and eventually fails in the majority of lesions and patients. Efforts to understand the causes for this failure of regeneration have fueled research into the biology of remyelination and the complex, interdependent cellular and molecular factors that regulate this process. Examination of the mechanisms of repair of experimental lesions has demonstrated that remyelination occurs in two major phases. The first consists of colonization of lesions by oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), the second the differentiation of OPCs into myelinating oligodendrocytes that contact demyelinated axons to generate functional myelin sheaths. Several intracellular and extracellular molecules have been identified that mediate these two phases of repair. Theoretically, the repair of demyelinating lesions can be promoted by enhancing the intrinsic repair process (by providing one or more remyelination‐enhancing factors or via immunoglobulin therapy). Alternatively, endogenous repair can be bypassed by introducing myelinogenic cells into demyelinated areas; several cellular candidates have been identified that can mediate repair of experimental demyelinating lesions. Future challenges confronting therapeutic strategies to enhance remyelination will involve the translation of findings from basic science to clinical demyelinating disease.","Chari, Divya M.",Int Rev Neurobiol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0074774207790268; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0074774207790268; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17531860/,288

However, the role of NK cells during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has previously not been identified. Peripheral blood NK cells from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 naïve subjects were evaluated for their activation, degranulation, and interferon-gamma expression in the presence of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. K562 and lung epithelial cells were transfected with spike proteins and co-cultured with NK cells. The analysis was performed by flow cytometry and immune fluorescence. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins did not alter NK cell activation in a K562 in vitro model. On the contrary, SARS-CoV-2 spike 1 protein (SP1) intracellular expression by lung epithelial cells resulted in NK cell-reduced degranulation. Further experiments revealed a concomitant induction of HLA-E expression on the surface of lung epithelial cells and the recognition of an SP1-derived HLA-E-binding peptide. Simultaneously, there was increased modulation of the inhibitory receptor NKG2A/CD94 on NK cells when SP1 was expressed in lung epithelial cells. We ruled out the GATA3 transcription factor as being responsible for HLA-E increased levels and HLA-E/NKG2A interaction as implicated in NK cell exhaustion. We show for the first time that NK cells are affected by SP1 expression in lung epithelial cells via HLA-E/NKG2A interaction. The resulting NK cells’ exhaustion might contribute to immunopathogenesis in SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Bortolotti, Daria; Gentili, Valentina; Rizzo, Sabrina; Rotola, Antonella; Rizzo, Roberta",Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32859121/; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells9091975,288
