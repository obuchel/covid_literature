SUMMARY INTRODUCTION COVID-19 pandemic imposed sudden increase in hospital admissions, thus medical systems needed to reorganize entire hospitals quite often. Quick and efficient training is of outmost importance. Virtual reality team training is a promising tool for newly organized hospital units' staff. OBJECTIVE Our goal was to present the usefulness and applicability of virtual simulation exercises for training of field hospital personnel and to evaluate the adaptability of these created and tested exercise packs for urgent staff training of COVID-19 hospitals. METHOD Three prototypes of virtual reality exercises were assessed through two test courses. XVR simulation software was used to create virtual environments. Evaluation of exercise applicability and utility was performed by anonymous questionnaires. Statistical data-processing was performed using contingency table and chi-square tests. RESULTS 76 trainees from eight countries participated in the two pilot courses. 63.9% of the participants stated that the method is suitable for conducting such exercises, but needs further development. Its technical use is ""easy enough"" to learn (59.7%) and provides an interactive (90.32%) and realistic (45.0%) working environment. DISCUSSION Virtual reality is applicable to train field hospital staffs for real missions. The created virtual exercise packages are easily adaptable, both in content and structure, to workshops dedicated for quick training of specific COVID-19 temporary medical facility's personnel. CONCLUSION Virtual reality is a promising educational tool that can complement the expensive and laborious field exercises, with comparable training efficiency. These virtual reality experiences may become real professional memories and create swiftly a secure and efficient professional milieu.

71676,Chest tubes in COVID-19 times: a safe way to protect the team.,2020,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Flow diverters are increasingly used in the endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms. Our aim was to determine neurologic complication rates following Pipeline Embolization Device placement for intracranial aneurysm treatment in a real-world setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively evaluated all patients with intracranial aneurysms treated with the Pipeline Embolization Device between July 2008 and February 2013 in 17 centers worldwide. We defined 4 subgroups: internal carotid artery aneurysms of ≥10 mm, ICA aneurysms of <10 mm, other anterior circulation aneurysms, and posterior circulation aneurysms. Neurologic complications included spontaneous rupture, intracranial hemorrhage, ischemic stroke, permanent cranial neuropathy, and mortality. Comparisons were made with t tests or ANOVAs for continuous variables and the Pearson χ(2) or Fisher exact test for categoric variables. RESULTS In total, 793 patients with 906 aneurysms were included. The neurologic morbidity and mortality rate was 8.4% (67/793), highest in the posterior circulation group (16.4%, 9/55) and lowest in the ICA <10-mm group (4.8%, 14/294) (P = .01). The spontaneous rupture rate was 0.6% (5/793). The intracranial hemorrhage rate was 2.4% (19/793). Ischemic stroke rates were 4.7% (37/793), highest in patients with posterior circulation aneurysms (7.3%, 4/55) and lowest in the ICA <10-mm group (2.7%, 8/294) (P = .16). Neurologic mortality was 3.8% (30/793), highest in the posterior circulation group (10.9%, 6/55) and lowest in the anterior circulation ICA <10-mm group (1.4%, 4/294) (P < .01). CONCLUSIONS Aneurysm treatment with the Pipeline Embolization Device is associated with the lowest complication rates when used to treat small ICA aneurysms. Procedure-related morbidity and mortality are higher in the treatment of posterior circulation and giant aneurysms.","Kallmes, D F; Hanel, R; Lopes, D; Boccardi, E; Bonafé, A; Cekirge, S; Fiorella, D; Jabbour, P; Levy, E; McDougall, C; Siddiqui, A; Szikora, I; Woo, H; Albuquerque, F; Bozorgchami, H; Dashti, S R; Delgado Almandoz, J E; Kelly, M E; Turner, R; Woodward, B K; Brinjikji, W; Lanzino, G; Lylyk, P",AJNR.

73955,Information on occupation of patients with Covid-19: Literature review.,2020-07-01,"BACKGROUND Biofilms are complex communities of living bacteria surrounded by a protective glycocalyx. Biofilms have been implicated in the development of infections such as dental caries and hardware infections. Biofilms form on endotracheal tubes (ETT) and can impact airway resistance. The lifecycle of a biofilm has four stages. We hypothesize that there is a relationship between the stage of biofilm on the ETT and development of pneumonia. METHODS Thirty-two ETT were analyzed for biofilms and staged. Staging was performed by a microbiologist blinded to all patient information. Data included development of pneumonia, duration of intubation, comorbidities, and microbiology. Pneumonia was defined as presence of fever, WBC >12 K or <4 K, infiltrate on chest X-ray, and purulent sputum with +lower airway culture (bronchoalveolar lavage or brush). Statistics were performed by a biostatistician; p < 0.05 defined significance. RESULTS There were 11 women and 21 men with a mean age of 50 years. Mean intensive care unit days were 13 (standard deviation ± 9.9) and mean length of intubation was 7.4 days (standard deviation ± 5.0). Half (16 of 32) the patients developed pneumonia while intubated. Eight of 10 patients with a stage IV biofilm had pneumonia. There was a relationship between increasing biofilm stage with the incidence of pneumonia (p < 0.05). Stage IV biofilms were associated with pneumonia (p < 0.02). There was no relationship to duration of intubation, patient age or hospital stay and biofilm stage. CONCLUSIONS Advanced biofilm stage (stage IV) is associated with pneumonia. Duration of intubation does not predict biofilm stage.","Wilson, Alison; Gray, Dana; Karakiozis, Jacqueline; Thomas, John",The journal of trauma and acute care surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/ta.0b013e3182493a10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22491605/,839

77986,Current evidence of SARS-CoV-2 vertical transmission: an integrative review.,2020,"INTRODUCTION Outcomes in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) have been dramatically improved with the addition of anti-CD20 antibodies to chemotherapy, defining a new standard of care for many years. More recently, therapies targeting fundamental signaling and anti-apoptotic pathways within the CLL cell have demonstrated dramatic clinical responses, including in patients with high-risk prognostic markers, thus emerging as preferred therapy for many patients. While the addition of anti-CD20 antibodies to traditional chemotherapy resulted in significant improvements in outcomes, the role of monoclonal antibodies in the era of targeted agents remains an active area of investigation. Furthermore, since the advent of next generation anti-CD20 antibodies, the role of specific anti-CD20 antibodies remains an open question. AREAS COVERED In this review, we highlight the important role that anti-CD20 antibody therapy has had in the field of CLL, both when used with chemotherapy and in combination with targeted therapy, as well as the current studies that are further exploring this treatment paradigm in the modern era. EXPERT OPINION While anti-CD20 antibodies have played a pivotal role in the treatment of CLL, additional studies will be required to determine the optimal application of these therapies in combination with targeted therapy.","Crombie, Jennifer L; Brown, Jennifer R",Expert opinion on emerging drugs,https://doi.org/10.1080/14728214.2021.1966414; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34375544/,839

80822,COVID-19 and health literacy: the yell of a silent epidemic amidst the pandemic.,2020,"UNLABELLED Strong overexpression of glucagonlike peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptors in human insulinoma provides an attractive target for imaging. The first clinical trials demonstrated that GLP-1 receptor SPECT/CT using [Lys(40)(Ahx [6-aminohexanoic acid]-DOTA-(111)In)NH(2)]-exendin-4 can localize hardly detectable insulinomas. However, [Lys(40)(Ahx-DOTA-(111)In)NH(2)]-exendin-4 imaging has drawbacks related to the use of (111)In in that it is costly and carries a relatively high radiation burden for the patient. The aim of this study was the preclinical evaluation of [Lys(40)(Ahx-DOTA-(68)Ga)NH(2)]-exendin-4 for PET/CT and [Lys(40)(Ahx-hydrazinonicotinamide [HYNIC]-(99m)Tc)NH(2)]-exendin-4 for SPECT/CT. METHODS Internalization, biodistribution, dosimetry, and imaging studies were performed in the Rip1Tag2 mouse model of pancreatic beta-cell carcinogenesis and compared with our gold standard [Lys(40)(Ahx-DOTA-(111)In)NH(2)]-exendin-4. Poly-glutamic acid and Gelofusine, a gelatin-based plasma expander, were used for renal uptake reduction studies. RESULTS The tumor uptake of [Lys(40)(Ahx-DOTA-(68)Ga)NH(2)]-exendin-4 was 205 +/- 59 percentage injected activity per gram of tissue at 4 h. Other GLP-1 receptor-positive organs showed more than 4.8 times lower radioactivity uptake. [Lys(40)(Ahx-HYNIC-(99m)Tc/ethylenediaminediacetic acid [EDDA])NH(2)]-exendin-4, compared with its (111)In- and (68)Ga-labeled sister compounds, showed significantly less tumor and organ uptake. The significantly lower tumor and organ uptake of [Lys(40)(Ahx-HYNIC-(99m)Tc/EDDA)NH(2)]-exendin-4 did not result in inferior tumor-to-organ ratios or reduced image quality. All radiopeptides tested showed a high tumor-to-background ratio, resulting in the visualization of small tumors (maximum diameter between 1.0 and 3.2 mm) by SPECT and PET. The only exception was the kidneys, which also showed high uptake. This uptake could be reduced by 49%-78% using poly-glutamic acid, Gelofusine, or a combination of the 2. The estimated effective radiation dose was 3.7 muSv/MBq for [Lys(40)(Ahx-HYNIC-(99m)Tc/EDDA)NH(2)]-exendin-4, which was 8 times less than that for [Lys(40)(Ahx-DOTA-(68)Ga)NH(2)]-exendin-4 and 43 times less than that for [Lys(40)(Ahx-DOTA-(111)In)NH(2)]-exendin-4. CONCLUSION These promising pharmacokinetic and imaging data show that [Lys(40)(Ahx-DOTA-(68)Ga)NH(2)]-exendin-4 and [Lys(40)(Ahx-HYNIC-(99m)Tc/EDDA)NH(2)]-exendin-4 are suitable candidates for clinical GLP-1 receptor imaging studies.","Wild, Damian; Wicki, Andreas; Mansi, Rosalba; Béhé, Martin; Keil, Boris; Bernhardt, Peter; Christofori, Gerhard; Ell, Peter J; Mäcke, Helmut R","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",https://doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.110.074914; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20595511/,839
82977,"In times of COVID-19, epidemiology is a unifying science.",2020,"Internal trapping with coils is an established treatment of symptomatic large non-branching thrombosed fusiform vertebral artery aneurysms (VAA). However, when perforators arise near the aneurysm neck, parent artery occlusion has a high risk of causing medullary infarction. As an alternative treatment, we performed short-segment internal trapping of the artery using n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (NBCA) and coils (bird's nest trapping). Before treatment, perianeurysmal perforators are carefully detected using high-resolution three-dimensional rotational angiography (3DRA). Double microcatheters are advanced to the distal portion of the aneurysm through a balloon guiding catheter where coils are deployed without tight packing. Then, NBCA is injected into the coil mass, taking care to preserve perforators and significant branches. The same maneuver is repeated in the proximal portion of the aneurysm. Coil placement is avoided within the middle of the aneurysm; however, if necessary, only a small number of coils are placed to prevent worsening of mass effect. Two quinquagenarian males presented with a large thrombosed fusiform VAA that caused symptoms due to mass effect. In each case, perforators arose from the parent artery and short-segment internal trapping with NBCA and coils was performed. Symptoms improved after treatment and follow-up imaging confirmed aneurysm shrinkage with no long-time recurrence. In symptomatic large fusiform VAAs where the distance from the lesion to important perforators is extremely short, internal trapping using a combination of NBCA and coils can be more useful than conventional internal trapping.","Nishihori, Masahiro; Izumi, Takashi; Tsukada, Tetsuya; Kropp, Asuka Elisabeth; Uda, Kenji; Yokoyama, Kinya; Araki, Yoshio; Wakabayashi, Toshihiko",Neurologia medico-chirurgica,https://doi.org/10.2176/nmc.tn.2020-0329; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33642453/,839

During left robotic partial nephrectomy (RPN), a perinephric hematoma was encountered. The hematoma was not present on preoperative imaging and was likely a result of the renal biopsy. The renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and the associated hematoma were widely excised with negative surgical margins. On follow-up imaging at five months postoperatively, a recurrent renal mass at the surgical resection bed and several new nodules in the omentum were detected. During completion left robotic total nephrectomy and omental excision, intraoperative frozen sections confirmed metastatic RCC. We believe that a hematoma seeded with RCC formed as a result of the renal biopsy, and subsequent disruption of the hematoma during RPN caused contamination of RCC into the surrounding structures.","Caputo, Christopher; Lee, Ziho; Harbin, Andrew; Eun, Daniel",Case reports in urology,https://doi.org/10.1155/2014/975412; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25544929/,839

METHODS Participant-level age-corrected NIHTB-CB data were extracted from six studies in individuals with a history of stroke, mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), treatment-resistant psychosis, and healthy controls, with testing administered under standard conditions. Prorated fluid and total cognition scores were estimated using regression equations that excluded the three fluid cognition NIHTB-CB instruments which cannot be administered remotely. Paired t tests and intraclass correlations (ICCs) were used to compare the standard and prorated scores. RESULTS Data were available for 245 participants. For fluid cognition, overall prorated scores were higher than standard scores (mean difference = +4.5, SD = 14.3; p < 0.001; ICC = 0.86). For total cognition, overall prorated scores were higher than standard scores (mean difference = +2.7, SD = 8.3; p < 0.001; ICC = 0.88). These differences were significant in the stroke and mTBI groups, but not in the healthy control or psychosis groups. CONCLUSIONS Prorated scores from an abbreviated NIHTB-CB protocol are not a valid replacement for the scores from the standard protocol.

95923,The face mask as an established symbol against COVID-19.,2020-10-01,"INTRODUCTION Healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) are a worldwide problem. Infection control in hospitals is usually implemented by an infection control team (ICT). Initially, ICTs consisted of doctors, nurses, epidemiologists and microbiologists; then, in the 1980s, the infection control link nurse (ICLN) system was introduced. ICTs (with or without the ICLN system) work to ensure the health and well-being of patients and healthcare professionals in hospitals and other healthcare settings, such as acute care clinics, community health centres and care homes. No previous study has reported the effects of ICTs on HCAIs. This systematic review aims to assess the effectiveness of ICTs with or without the ICLN system in reducing HCAIs in hospitals and other healthcare settings. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will perform a comprehensive literature search for randomised controlled trials in four databases: PubMed, Embase, CINAHL and the Cochrane Library. The primary outcomes are: patient-based/clinical outcomes (rate of HCAIs, death due to HCAIs and length of hospital stay) and staff-based/behavioural outcomes (compliance with infection control practices). The secondary outcomes include the costs to the healthcare system or patients due to extended lengths of stay. Following data extraction, we will assess the risk of bias by using the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care risk of bias tool. If data can be pooled across all the studies, we will perform a meta-analysis. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION We will use publicly available data, and therefore, ethical approval is not required for this systematic review. The findings will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals.

96292,Science of consciousness: reflections on the Pandemic by COVID-19.,2020,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to a large family of zoonotic supercapsid viruses, including about 40 species of RNA-containing viruses with several strains capable of causing damage to the lungs and respiratory tract. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was responsible for the worldwide SARS outbreak in 2003. The rapid global spread of SARS-CoV-2 has been the cause of significant health concern and thousands of deaths in 2019-2020 and outlined the need for novel antivirals. The present review is devoted to the development of effective and selective nucleoside drugs for the treatment of coronavirus infections. To date, about half of antivirals have been created based on nucleosides. The majority of drugs based on nucleosides have been approved by FDA. This indicates a fruitful area for the development of novel antivirals based on nucleosides. The review describes the main features of pathogenic SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 strains, presents their comparison, considers promising approaches to creating nucleoside drugs for the treatment of coronavirus infections, and provides a systematic evaluation of all the known nucleoside derivatives, which inhibit the reproduction of coronaviruses in cells. To date, two known nucleoside drugs (Ribavirin, Favipiravir) have been recommended for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and nine hit compounds based on nucleosides and their analogues have been found, one of which efficiently suppressing SARS-CoV-2 replication and eight others inhibiting SARS-CoV replication.","Zenchenko, Anastasia A; Drenichev, Mikhail S; Mikhailov, Sergey N",Current medicinal chemistry,https://doi.org/10.2174/0929867328666210208181724; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33563148/,839

We sought to assess the impact of body mass index (BMI) on the acute antidepressant effects of ketamine in patients with treatment-resistant depression. METHODS/PROCEDURES Post hoc analyses were conducted from a multisite, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to assess the rapid-onset effects of intravenous ketamine. Patients (n = 99) were randomized to a single dose administration of ketamine 0.1 mg/kg (n = 18), ketamine 0.2 mg/kg (n = 20), ketamine 0.5 mg/kg (n = 22), ketamine 1.0 mg/kg (n = 20), or active placebo, midazolam 0.045 mg/kg (n = 19). Patients were stratified for BMI. For patients randomized to ketamine (n = 80), BMI was assessed as a continuous variable and also categorically (obese, overweight, not obese/overweight [reference]). The primary outcome measure was the change on the 6-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 24 hours after treatment. Outcomes at day 3 were also assessed. FINDINGS/RESULTS The 6-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale change scores at 24 hours were inversely associated with BMI (-0.28 ± 0.12, P = 0.02). With BMI operationalized categorically, both obese (-4.15 ± 1.41, P = 0.004) and overweight (-1.99 ± 1.14, P = 0.08) categories were inversely related to the 6-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale change score at 24 hours, statistically significant for the obese category, as compared with the reference group. Similar but weaker findings were observed at 72 hours after infusion. IMPLICATIONS/CONCLUSIONS Higher BMI and obesity were associated with a more robust acute antidepressant response to ketamine. This may have clinical relevance for a great number of patients who have both MDD and obesity.

99799,Risk of venous thromboembolism in users of contraception and menopausal hormone therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic.,2020,"In plants, Fruits and their wastes are the main sources of bioactive compounds. Currently, Annona fruits have attracted the attention of people interested in health-promoting foods due to their phytochemical content that their activities were not studied before. This study aimed to explore the potential antioxidant, antimicrobial, and in vitro anticancer activity of two cultivars Annona squamosa (Annona b. and Annona h.) seed, peel, and pulp. We also meausred phenolic, flavonoid, sulfated polysaccharide, tannins, and triterpenoids. Polyphenol identification was determined using RP-HPLC. Results of the antioxidant activity revealed that the highest activity was observed for Annona h. seed extract using DPPH and ABTS assays with IC50 6.07 ± 0.50 and 9.58 ± 0.53 µg/ml, respectively. The antimicrobial activity against various pathogenic strains revealed that the peel extracts of both Annona b. and Annona h. exhibited the best antimicrobial activity. We also assessed the IC50 values for anticancer activity in all six Annona b. and Annona h samples against four cancer cell lines colon (Caco-2), prostate (PC3), liver (HepG-2), and breast (MCF-7) using MTT assay. Annona b. and Annona h seed extracts had the lowest IC50 values for four cancer cell lines with 7.31 ± 0.03 and 15.99 ± 1.25 for PC-3 and MCF-7, respectively. Both seed extracts, Annona b. and Annona h., showed significantly down-regulated mRNA expression of Bcl-2 and up-regulated p53 in all treated cell lines. Apoptosis was evaluated using nuclear staining, flow cytometric analysis, and immunohistochemistry of the proliferation marker (Ki-67). Additional studies are required to characterize the bioactive compounds responsible for the observed activities of Annona seed and determine its mechanism as an anticancer drug.","Shehata, Mohamed Gamal; Abu-Serie, Marwa Muhammad; Abd El-Aziz, Nourhan Mohammad; El-Sohaimy, Sobhy Ahmed",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85772-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33737634/,839

In this paper, we report data related to the reach, engagement, and visitor profile of Break Binge Eating, an online platform designed to provide evidence-based information and self-help strategies for people at all stages of an ED. METHOD Two sources of data were presented: (a) usage data from platform visitors generated through Google Analytics; and (b) characteristics of a sample of platform visitors (n = 786). RESULTS In 13 months, approximately 46,311 unique users worldwide have accessed this platform, with usage rates rapidly increasing each month. Most visitors came from organic searches (when ED-related information is directly searched in a browser). Self-help content was the most accessed material, and 81% of the sample stated that their reason for accessing the platform was to get help. Sample visitors were highly symptomatic; 52% met criteria resembling a threshold ED and 87% engaged in at least one ED behavior in the past month. Across different symptomatic subgroups, ∼50% were unsure whether they needed help, ∼80% were not receiving any help, and ∼75% were highly concerned with their symptoms. CONCLUSION This online platform has broad reach and is engaging its intended audience. It is an aim of this platform to improve mental health literacy, facilitate symptom recognition and improvement, and alleviate help-seeking barriers. Evaluating whether this platform is achieving its intended aims in a randomized controlled trial is the next step.","Linardon, Jake; Rosato, John; Messer, Mariel",The International journal of eating disorders,https://doi.org/10.1002/eat.23356; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32776693/,839

SARS-CoV-2 was reported to be the causative agent of the disease and was identified as being similar to SARS-CoV, a causative agent of SARS in 2003. In this review, we described the phylogeny of SARS-CoV-2, covering various related studies, in particular, focusing on viruses obtained from horseshoe bats and pangolins that belong to Sarbecovirus, a subgenus of Betacoronavirus. We also describe the virological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and compare them with other coronaviruses. More than 30,000 genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 are available in the GISAID database as of May 28, 2020. Using the genome sequence data of closely related viruses, the genomic characteristics and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 were extensively studied. However, given the global prevalence of COVID-19 and the large number of associated deaths, further computational and experimental virological analyses are required to fully characterize SARS-CoV-2.","Nakagawa, So; Miyazawa, Takayuki",Inflammation and regeneration,https://doi.org/10.1186/s41232-020-00126-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33349272/,839

However, power-free and clear visualization of results still remain challenging. In this study, we developed a paper device integrated with power-free DNA detection strategy realized by polydopamine aggregation. In the presence of DNA amplicons, the polymerization of dopamine into aggregated polydopamine was hindered, while in the absence of DNA amplicons, polydopamine aggregation is facilitated. The porosity of the paper enabled the capillary flow of dispersed polydopamine for positive sample, while aggregated polydopamine remained at the bottom of the paper strip due to large size of the aggregates for negative sample. Based on this mechanism, we fabricated a slidable paper device integrating LAMP with dopamine polymerization for the naked-eye detection, operated in a seamless manner. Moreover, the introduced paper device was successfully used to detect DNA extracted from Escherichia coli O157:H7 and SARS-CoV-2 within 25 min, as well as Enterococcus faecium within 35 min. The detection limits of both Escherichia coli O157:H7 and SARS-CoV-2 were 10-4 ng/μL. The introduced paper device can be used as a simple and sensitive tool for detecting multiple infectious pathogens, making it an ideal tool particularly for resource-limited environment.","Nguyen, Hanh An; Lee, Nae Yoon",Biosensors & bioelectronics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2021.113353; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34049080/,839

Yet the case of sensory words, especially referring to touch, remains overlooked. We investigated the influence of verbs denoting tactile sensations on tactile perception. In Experiment 1, participants detected tactile stimulations on their forearm, preceded by tactile or non-tactile verbs by one of three delays (170, 350, 500 ms) reflecting different word processing stages. Results revealed shorter reaction times to tactile stimulations following tactile than non-tactile verbs, irrespective of delay. To ensure that priming pertained to tactile, and not motor, verb properties, Experiment 2 compared the impact of tactile verbs to both action and non-tactile verbs, while stimulations were delivered on the index finger. No priming emerged following action verbs, therefore not supporting the motor-grounded interpretation. Facilitation by tactile verbs was however not observed, possibly owing to methodological changes. Experiment 3, identical to Experiment 2 except that stimulation was delivered to participants' forearm, replicated the priming effect. Importantly, tactile stimulations were detected faster after tactile than after both non-tactile and action verbs, indicating that verbs' tactile properties engaged resources shared with sensory perception. Our findings suggest that language conveying tactile information can activate somatosensory representations and subsequently promote tactile detection.","Boulenger, Véronique; Martel, Marie; Bouvet, Cécile; Finos, Livio; Krzonowski, Jennifer; Farnè, Alessandro; Roy, Alice Catherine",Brain and cognition,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bandc.2020.105582; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32422452/,839
107390,Reducing overcrowding in an emergency department: a pilot study.,2019-12-01,"INTRODUCTION Healthcare workers are particularly susceptible to developing COVID-19 owing to close and frequent contact with COVID-19 patients. This cross-sectional study aimed to describe prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among healthcare workers within a hospital trust and examine factors associated with increased prevalence of this antibody. METHODS Data was obtained over a 4-week period in 2020 from a cross-sectional prospective survey of healthcare workers serving a multi-ethnic inner-city population who had immunoglobulin G SARS-CoV-2 antibody test. Anonymised socio-demographic data about staff were cross-referenced with these tests. RESULTS Of 7,013 staff, 6,212 (89%) undertook the antibody test during this period. Overall detection rate was 26% (1,584/6,212). Univariate analyses revealed no differences in prevalence in terms of gender or age. Compared with white staff members (18%), rates were higher in black (38%) and Asian (27%) members (p<0.001). The rates in general wards (43%) were higher compared with other areas; in emergency medicine and intensive care, prevalence was 23% (p<0.001). Regarding professional groups, prevalence was highest among nursing and allied clinical services (28%), less in doctors (23%) and lower in non-clinical staff (19%). DISCUSSION This large study has described prevalence of recent exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers and determined associations including ethnicity, professional groups and geographical areas within healthcare settings. This information will be useful in future COVID-19 studies examining the role of antibody testing both in general populations and in healthcare settings.","Patel, Mehool; Nair, Meera; Pirozzoli, Eric; Cienfuegos, Marta C; Aitken, Elizabeth",Clinical medicine,https://doi.org/10.7861/clinmed.2020-0619; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33479076/,839

For this research to be successful, it is necessary to understand the pathology of the virus. So far, we know that this virus can harm different organs of the body. Although the exact mechanisms are still unknown, this phenomenon may result from the body's secretion of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which is involved in several inflammation and immunity pathways. Noticeably, the expression of this molecule can lead to a cytokine storm causing a variety of side effects. In this paper, we discuss those side effects in SARS-COV-2 infection separately to determine whether PGE2 is, indeed, an important causative factor. Lastly, we propose a mechanism by which PGE2 production increases in response to COVID-19 disease and suggest the possible direct relation between PGE2 levels and the severity of this disease.

We evaluated the performance of these risk scoring systems in patients with gastric cancer and tumor bleeding. METHODS This retrospective study included patients with inoperable gastric cancer who presented with tumor bleeding at the National Cancer Center, Korea, between 2001 and 2015. The GBS, and admission and full Rockall scores were calculated. Primary outcome was the performance of the risk scoring systems in predicting the need for urgent interventions (endoscopic therapy, transarterial embolization, and surgery). The risk factors associated with urgent intervention were analyzed. RESULTS Of 357 patients with tumor bleeding, 118 (33.1 %; 116 endoscopic therapy, 2 trans-arterial embolization) required urgent intervention. The full Rockall score was better at predicting the need for urgent intervention (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.78; P < 0.001) than the GBS (0.56) and admission Rockall score (0.56). Hemostatic intervention was not performed in patients with a full Rockall score ≤ 6 (103 patients, 28.9 %). On multivariate analysis, endoscopic stigmata of recent hemorrhage of Forrest classes Ia - IIb were significant factors associated with urgent intervention. CONCLUSIONS The full Rockall score was superior to the GBS and admission Rockall score in predicting the need for urgent intervention for tumor bleeding. Thus, endoscopic evaluation is required to determine the need for urgent intervention in patients with gastric cancer and tumor bleeding.","Kim, Young-Il; Choi, Il Ju; Lee, Jong Yeul; Kim, Chan Gyoo; Kim, Hark Kyun; Park, Young Iee",Endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1114-6000; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32097976/,839

METHODS The TransFLUas influenza transmission study in acute healthcare prospectively followed HCWs prospectively over 2 consecutive influenza seasons. Symptom diaries asking for respiratory symptoms and adherence with mask use recommendations were recorded on a daily basis, and study participants provided midturbinate nasal swabs for influenza testing. RESULTS In total, 152 HCWs (65.8% nurses and 13.2% physicians) were included: 89.1% of study participants reported at least 1 influenza symptom during their study season and 77.8% suffered from respiratory symptoms. Also, 28.3% of HCW missed at least 1 working day during the study period: 82.6% of these days were missed because of symptoms of influenza illness. Of all participating HCWs, 67.9% worked with symptoms of influenza infection on 8.8% of study days. On 0.3% of study days, symptomatic HCWs were shedding influenza virus while at work. Among HCWs with respiratory symptoms, 74.1% adhered to the policy to wear a mask at work on 59.1% of days with respiratory symptoms. CONCLUSIONS Respiratory disease is frequent among HCWs and imposes a significant economic burden on hospitals due to the number of working days lost. Presenteesm with respiratory illness, including influenza, is also frequent and poses a risk for patients and staff.

A review article.,2020-04-01,"Retina, one of the highest oxygen demanding tissues, is vulnerable to vascular insufficiencies, and various ocular vascular disorders can cause chronic retinal ischemia. To investigate the pathophysiology, rodent models developed by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) have been utilized. However, mice lack posterior communicating arteries in the circle of Willis and cannot endure the brain ischemia induced by the bilateral occlusion. A mouse model to better reflect the localized ischemic stress in the retina without affecting the brain is still needed. Here, we established a mouse model of ischemic injury by permanent unilateral common carotid artery occlusion (UCCAO). Adult male mice were subjected to UCCAO, and changes in the ipsilateral retina were examined in comparison with the contralateral retina. Delayed perfusion was observed in the ipsilateral retina right after the occlusion and was not recovered later on. Common features of retinal ischemia were observed: hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) stabilization; upregulation of hypoxia-responsive genes; altered levels of cytokines and chemokines. Activation of astrocytes and Müller cells in the inner retina was detected at day 2, and thinning of the inner retinal layer became significant at week 10. Together, our model can simulate retinal ischemia with morphological and molecular changes. It can be utilized to investigate pathophysiology of ischemic retinopathies.","Lee, Deokho; Kang, Heekyoung; Yoon, Ki Young; Chang, Yuan Yi; Song, Hyun Beom",Experimental eye research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exer.2020.108275; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991884/,839

The aims of this study are to: (1) understand the pattern and predictors of handwashing using soap/detergent and water; and (2) assess the spatial clustering of handwashing through soap/detergent and water at the district level in India. Methods Data of households where the place for handwashing was observed by the research investigators (n = 582,064), gathered through the National Family Health Survey-4 (2015-2016), were used for this analysis. The availability of soap/detergent and water at the usual place of handwashing was assumed to be used for handwashing. Binary logistic regression was carried out to examine the adjusted effect of socioeconomic characteristics on the use of soap/detergent and water for handwashing. The univariate local indicator of spatial association (LISA) cluster map and Moran's I statistics were applied for assessing spatial autocorrelations at the district level. Analyses were carried out with IBM-SPSS Software. Results Two-fifths of Indian households do not use both soap/detergent and water for handwashing. Households using both the cleansing elements vary considerably by socioeconomic characteristics- worse for the socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. There is spatial clustering in the use of soap/detergent and water for handwashing: lower in a cluster of districts in eastern India.

In the present study, 192 Asian Indian international students completed a survey to understand how colorblind racial ideology and sense of belonging impacted their racism-related stress. We also examined this relationship based on gender and level of education. Our results suggest that colorblind racial ideology, sense of belonging, gender, and level of education significantly explained 32.3% of the variance in racism-related stress. In general, students who identified as men and undergraduate students (versus graduate students) reported higher levels of racism-related stress. Our findings suggests that in addition to the acculturation barriers international students face, Asian Indian international students deal with barriers related to racism. These findings have implications for educators and counselors in higher education institutions that Asian Indian international students have multifaceted identities that impact how they interpret racism.","Aggarwal, Aashna; Çiftçi, Ayşe",Psychological reports,https://doi.org/10.1177/0033294120961063; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962534/,839

METHODS This was a prospective, randomized, pilot study of 40 hemodialysis patients randomized to a 30% ethanol/4% sodium citrate or heparin 1000 units/mL locking solution. The primary outcome was identification of any serious adverse events over the study duration. Secondary outcomes included the rate per 1000 catheter days for catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI), alteplase use, catheter dysfunction, and catheter removal. RESULTS Three serious adverse events were reported as possibly related to the catheter solutions. Only one CRBSI was observed during the study in the heparin arm. The rate of alteplase use was 1.5/1000 catheter days in the heparin arm compared to 2.8/1000 catheter days in the ethanol/citrate arm (rate ratio = 1.85, 90% CI 0.48, 7.07, p value = 0.45), while the rate of catheter dysfunction was 6.8/1000 catheter days in the heparin arm compared to 1.9/1000 catheter days in the ethanol citrate arm (rate ratio = 0.27, 90% CI 0.10, 0.74, p value = 0.04). Catheter survival to first catheter outcome was longer in the ethanol/citrate group compared to heparin and there were no catheter removals due to bacteremia or thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS The ethanol/sodium citrate locking solution was safely used in this study. It appears to prevent CRBSI and may improve catheter survival compared to heparin.

We investigated whether integration of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic monitoring can be used to evaluate responses to infliximab induction and maintenance therapy, based on findings from endoscopy. METHODS We performed a post-hoc analysis of patients with CD included in a trial to test the effects of infliximab dose escalation, based on biomarkers and serum concentrations of infliximab, on symptoms (the TAILORIX trial; n=122). We analyzed data from this study to determine whether concentrations of biomarkers and serum concentrations of infliximab associated with endoscopic outcomes (n=116). The primary endpoints were endoscopic response (CD endoscopic index of severity [CDEIS] decrease ≥50% from baseline), endoscopic remission (CDEIS <3), and absence of ulcers at weeks 12 and 54 of infliximab treatment. RESULTS Infliximab trough concentrations >23.1 mg/L at week 2 and >10.0 mg/L at week 6 were associated with endoscopic remission at week 12 (positive predictive values 72% and 76% and negative predictive values, 65% and 59%, respectively). During maintenance therapy, we found evidence for an exposure-response relationship only following dose escalation; trough concentrations >10.6 mg/L associated with the absence of ulcers at week 54 (positive predictive value, 49% and negative predictive value, 92%). Low fecal concentrations of calprotectin during therapy were associated with endoscopic response and remission (P<.05). Dose escalations increased trough concentrations of infliximab; persistent increase in fecal concentration of calprotectin, despite dose escalation, associated with lack of endoscopic response and remission. A significantly higher proportion of patients with antibodies to infliximab, identified by a drug-tolerant assay, dropped out of the study compared to patients without antibodies (P<.0001). CONCLUSIONS In a post-hoc analysis of data from a trial to test the effects of infliximab dose escalation on symptoms, we found that during maintenance therapy, the combination of fecal concentration of calprotectin and trough concentration of infliximab can guide dose adjustment and increase the chances for endoscopic response and remission.

RESULTS A cohesive framework based upon core bioethical values is presented here to assist plastic surgeons in navigating this rapidly evolving global pandemic. CONCLUSION Plastic surgeons around the world have been affected by COVID-19 and will adapt to continue serving their patients. The lessons learned in this present pandemic will undoubtedly prove useful in future challenges to come.","Chi, David; Chen, Austin D; Dorante, Miguel I; Lee, Bernard T; Sacks, Justin M",Journal of reconstructive microsurgery,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1714378; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32693423/,839
137586,In the time of corona - is it safe to delay treatment for prostate cancer?,2020-04-01,"BACKGROUND Adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) experience higher rates of psychological disorders compared to their healthy peers. As poor psychological health has been associated with sub-optimal glycaemic control and more frequent complications, there is an urgent need to develop more 'clinically usable' interventions. Digital mental health interventions offer unique advantages compared to in-person interventions, however, what adolescents with T1D want in terms of content and functionality is poorly understood. Accordingly, the current study conducted focus groups to examine the views of adolescents with T1D regarding digital mental health interventions. METHODS Four focus groups were conducted, including 16 adolescents with T1D, ranging from 13- to 17-years in age (69% female). Transcripts were analysed using directed content analysis to examine (1) 'what adolescents dislike about existing digital mental health interventions?' and (2) 'what adolescents want in future digital mental health interventions?'. RESULTS Findings provide a preliminary understanding of what adolescents dislike and also the type of content and functional features which may be important to include in digital mental health programs for this population, such as a peer support feature (reported by 16 of 16), emotion and diabetes check-in feature (11 of 16), and diabetes-relevant content (12 of 16). CONCLUSIONS Early data suggests that digital mental health interventions should include a significant peer support element, diabetes-relevant content and examples, and check-in on their mental health and diabetes self-management regularly, whilst avoiding fixed responses or modules and non-age appropriate content. Based on these findings, a digital intervention is currently being developed.","Boggiss, Anna L; Consedine, Nathan S; Schache, Kiralee R; Wallace-Boyd, Kate; Cao, Nicholas; Hofman, Paul L; Serlachius, Anna S",Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,https://doi.org/10.1111/dme.14591; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33930211/,839
141529,Is the COVID-19 disease associated with de novo nephritic syndrome?,2020-09-01,"Hypoxia-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis is one of the leading causes of heart failure. Nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1) was suggested as a protector against cell apoptosis. however, the mechanism is not clear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to elucidate the role of NRF-1 in hypoxia-induced H9C2 cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and to explore its effect on regulating the death receptor pathway and mitochondrial pathways. NRF-1 was overexpressed or knocked-down in H9C2 cells, which were then exposed to a hypoxia condition for 0, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h. Changes in cell proliferation, cell viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were investigated. The activities of caspase-3, -8, and -9, apoptosis rate, and the gene and protein expression levels of the death receptor pathway and mitochondrial pathway were analyzed. Under hypoxia exposure, NRF-1 overexpression improved the proliferation and viability of H9C2 cells, and decreased ROS generation, MMP loss, caspase activities, and the apoptosis rate. However, the NRF-1 knockdown group showed the opposite results. Additionally, NRF-1 upregulated the expression of anti-apoptotic molecules involved in the death receptor and mitochondrial pathways, such as CASP8 and FADD-like apoptosis regulator, B-cell lymphoma 2, B-cell lymphoma-extra-large, and cytochrome-C. Conversely, the expression of pro-apoptotic molecules such as caspase-8, BH3-interacting domain death agonist, Bcl-2-associated X protein, caspase-9, and caspase-3 was down-regulated by NRF-1 overexpression in hypoxia-induced H9C2 cells. These results suggest that NRF-1 functions as an anti-apoptotic factor in the death receptor and mitochondrial pathways to mitigate hypoxia-induced apoptosis in H9C2 cardiomyocytes.

141543,The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on levels of physical fitness.,2020,"BACKGROUND Current guidelines disagree on the role for applying force to electrodes during electrical cardioversion (ECV) for atrial fibrillation, particularly when using self-adhesive pads. We evaluated the impact of this practice on transthoracic impedance (TTI) with varying force and in individuals with differing body mass indices (BMI). We additionally assessed whether specific prompts could improve physicians' ECV technique. METHODS The study comprised three parts: (1) TTI was measured in 11 participants throughout the respiratory cycle and with variable force applied to self-adhesive electrodes in anteroposterior (AP) and anterolateral (AL) configurations. (2) Three participants in different BMI classes then had TTI measured with prespecified incremental force applied. (3) Ten blinded cardiology trainees simulated ECV on one participant with and without prompting (guideline reminders and force analogies) while force applied and TTI were measured. RESULTS The AP approach was associated with 13% lower TTI than AL (P < 0.001). Strongly negative correlations were observed between force applied and TTI in the AL position, irrespective of BMI (P ≤ 0.003). In all cases, 80% of the total reduction in TTI observed was achieved with 8 kg-force (∼80 N). All prompts resulted in significantly greater force applied and modest reductions in TTI. CONCLUSIONS Applying force to self-adhesive electrodes reduces TTI and should be considered as a means of improving ECV success. Numerically greater mean force applied with a ""push-up"" force analogy suggests that ""concrete"" cues may be useful in improving ECV technique.","Ramirez, F Daniel; Fiset, Sandra L; Cleland, Mark J; Zakutney, Timothy J; Nery, Pablo B; Nair, Girish M; Redpath, Calum J; Sadek, Mouhannad M; Birnie, David H",Pacing and clinical electrophysiology : PACE,https://doi.org/10.1111/pace.12937; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27550777/,839

However, it is unclear how esophageal varices (EV) treatment actually affects PHE. We aimed to analyze the effects of EV treatment on PHE. METHODS Among LC patients who underwent capsule endoscopy (CE) more than twice to confirm PHE at our hospital from February 2009 to September 2018, we targeted those with no change in the Child-Pugh classification after EV treatment for the prevention of bleeding. Patients were assigned to groups based on the EV treatment method (endoscopic injection sclerotherapy [EIS] group or endoscopic variceal ligation [EVL] group). We analyzed the PHE findings before and after treatment, and we investigated changes in the collateral vein using computed tomography imaging. RESULTS We analyzed 42 LC patients (27 men; mean age, 65.3 years); 20 were in the EIS group and 22 were in the EVL group. Exacerbation of PHE was significantly prevalent in the EIS group (90%) compared to that in the EVL group (50%). CE of PHE showed significantly prevalent exacerbation of villous edema in the EIS group (65%) compared to that in the EVL group (23%). Stenosis or disappearance of the feeding vessel (55%) and exacerbation of the hepatofugal collateral vein (35%) were significantly prevalent in the EIS group. CONCLUSIONS EIS exacerbates PHE, especially villous edema, in LC patients with changes in collateral circulation.","Otani, Ichiro; Oka, Shiro; Aikata, Hiroshi; Iio, Sumio; Tsuboi, Akiyoshi; Kunihara, Sayoko; Nagaoki, Yuko; Tanaka, Shinji; Chayama, Kazuaki",Digestion,https://doi.org/10.1159/000503060; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31574519/,839

149865,COVID-19 and acute myocarditis: current literature review and diagnostic challenges.,2020,": ACE2 receptor has a broad expression pattern in the cellular membrane and provides a protective action against the development of cardiovascular diseases. Recently, this enzyme has become of extreme interest during the pandemic infection of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). This virus invades alveolar epithelium and cardiomyocytes using ACE2 as a transmembrane receptor. ACE2 is a counter-regulatory peptide that degrades Ang II into Ang 1-7, thereby attenuating the biological effects of the AT1 receptor. The binding between the spike protein of COVID-19 and the enzyme is crucial for the virus to enter the target cells, but whether an increase in ACE2 activity could facilitate the infection is not yet demonstrated. However, this aspect has raised many concerns about the use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs in infected patients or patients at risk of infection. It appears that cellular infection leads to a reduction in ACE2 expression and an increase in the activity of the Ang II--AT1 axis, which leads to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, ARDS, myocarditis, and hypercoagulability with the possibility of exacerbation of acute coronary syndrome, induction of pulmonary embolism, or appearance of disseminated intravascular coagulation. Therefore, ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blocker drugs should be continued in infected patients, as their discontinuation can increase Ang II activity and induce injury to the lungs or cardiovascular system.","Barillà, Francesco; Bassareo, Pier Paolo; Calcaterra, Giuseppe; Romeo, Francesco; Mehta, Jawahar L",Journal of cardiovascular medicine,https://doi.org/10.2459/jcm.0000000000001071; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32740495/,839

152293,Demographic characteristics and neurological comorbidity of patients with COVID-19.,2020,"Respiratory disease in pigs is common in modern pork production worldwide and is often referred to as porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC). PRDC is polymicrobial in nature, and results from infection with various combinations of primary and secondary respiratory pathogens. As a true multifactorial disease, environmental conditions, population size, management strategies and pig-specific factors such as age and genetics also play critical roles in the outcome of PRDC. While non-infectious factors are important in the initiation and outcome of cases of PRDC, the focus of this review is on infectious factors only. There are a variety of viral and bacterial pathogens commonly associated with PRDC including porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), swine influenza virus (SIV), porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (MHYO) and Pasteurella multocida (PMULT). The pathogenesis of viral respiratory disease is typically associated with destruction of the mucocilliary apparatus and with interference and decrease of the function of pulmonary alveolar and intravascular macrophages. Bacterial pathogens often contribute to PRDC by activation of inflammation via enhanced cytokine responses. With recent advancements in pathogen detection methods, the importance of polymicrobial disease has become more evident, and identification of interactions of pathogens and their mechanisms of disease potentiation has become a topic of great interest. For example, combined infection of pigs with typically low pathogenic organisms like PCV2 and MHYO results in severe respiratory disease. Although the body of knowledge has advanced substantially in the last 15 years, much more needs to be learned about the pathogenesis and best practices for control of swine respiratory disease outbreaks caused by concurrent infection of two or more pathogens. This review discusses the latest findings on polymicrobial respiratory disease in pigs.","Opriessnig, T; Giménez-Lirola, L G; Halbur, P G",Animal health research reviews,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1466252311000120; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22152290/,839

The OFRR is based on a glass capillary, on which bottle-shaped and bubble-shaped ring resonators can form. The spectral position of the whispering gallery mode in the OFRR shifts when a nanoparticle is attached to the OFRR inner surface. For both ring resonator structures, the electric field at the inner surface can be optimized by choosing the right wall thickness. Meanwhile, different electric field confinement along the capillary longitudinal axis can be achieved with different curvatures. Both effects significantly increase the sensitivity of the ring resonator for single nanoparticle detection. It is found that the sensitivity is enhanced about 10 times, as compared to that of a solid microsphere biosensor recently reported, and that the smallest detectable nanoparticle is estimated to be less than 20 nm in radius for a Δλ/λ resolution of 10(-8). The high sensitivity and the naturally integrated capillary based microfluidics make the OFRR a very promising sensing platform for detection of various nano-sized bio/chemical species in liquid as well as in air.","Li, Hao; Guo, Yunbo; Sun, Yuze; Reddy, Karthik; Fan, Xudong",Optics express,https://doi.org/10.1364/oe.18.025081; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21164854/,839

Allyl methyl sulfide (AMS) is reportedly a persistent main active metabolite component of allicin after garlic ingestion accounting for at least 90% of the allicin consumed. Several studies have reported the presence of AMS in organs such as lung, kidney etc. and body fluids such as mucous, and blood-plasma. Glycoproteins of enveloped viruses are actively involved in viral pathogenesis. N-acetylneuraminic acid (sialic acid) and N-Acetylglucosamine, are some of the vital amino acids involved in several viral infections using glycoproteins via glycosylation. Simulations studies based on First-principles density functional theory show that these amino acids attach with AMS, and the reactions are thermodynamically spontaneous (ΔG and ΔS negative are at 310.15 K as well as lower and higher temperatures). Further, phospholipid phosphatidylethanolamine (a component of some viral envelops) also attaches readily with AMS and the reaction is spontaneous. AMS molecules attachment with viral phospholipids and amino-acids involved in viral infection would denature the virus and prevent its attachment to the host cell. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Retrospective studies of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, report an incidence of 3%-7% progressing to ARF, a marker of poor prognosis. The cause of the renal failure in COVID-19 is unknown, but one hypothesized mechanism is direct renal infection by the causative virus, SARS-CoV-2. METHODS We performed an autopsy on a single patient who died of COVID-19 after open repair of an aortic dissection, complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric renal failure. We used light and electron microscopy to examine renal tissue for evidence of SARS-CoV-2 within renal cells. RESULTS Light microscopy of proximal tubules showed geographic isometric vacuolization, corresponding to a focus of tubules with abundant intracellular viral arrays. Individual viruses averaged 76 µm in diameter and had an envelope studded with crown-like, electron-dense spikes. Vacuoles contained double-membrane vesicles suggestive of partially assembled virus. CONCLUSIONS The presence of viral particles in the renal tubular epithelium that were morphologically identical to SARS-CoV-2, and with viral arrays and other features of virus assembly, provide evidence of a productive direct infection of the kidney by SARS-CoV-2. This finding offers confirmatory evidence that direct renal infection occurs in the setting of AKI in COVID-19. However, the frequency and clinical significance of direct infection in COVID-19 is unclear. Tubular isometric vacuolization observed with light microscopy, which correlates with double-membrane vesicles containing vacuoles observed with electronic microscopy, may be a useful histologic marker for active SARS-CoV-2 infection in kidney biopsy or autopsy specimens.","Farkash, Evan A; Wilson, Allecia M; Jentzen, Jeffrey M",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,https://doi.org/10.1681/asn.2020040432; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32371536/,839

261762,Current evidence of SARS-CoV-2 vertical transmission: an integrative review,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing national lockdowns have dramatically changed the healthcare landscape. The pandemic's impact on people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains poorly understood. We hypothesised that the UK-wide lockdown restrictions were associated with reductions in severe COPD exacerbations. We provide the first national level analyses of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and first lockdown on severe COPD exacerbations resulting in emergency hospital admissions and/or leading to death as well as those recorded in primary care or emergency departments. METHODS: Using data from Public Health Scotland and the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage Databank in Wales, we accessed weekly counts of emergency hospital admissions and deaths due to COPD over the first 30 weeks of 2020 and compared these to the national averages over the preceding 5 years. For both Scotland and Wales, we undertook interrupted time-series analyses to model the impact of instigating lockdown on these outcomes. Using fixed-effect meta-analysis, we derived pooled estimates of the overall changes in trends across the two nations. RESULTS: Lockdown was associated with 48% pooled reduction in emergency admissions for COPD in both countries (incidence rate ratio, IRR 0.52, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.58), relative to the 5-year averages. There was no statistically significant change in deaths due to COPD (pooled IRR 1.08, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.33). In Wales, lockdown was associated with 39% reduction in primary care consultations for acute exacerbation of COPD (IRR 0.61, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.71) and 46% reduction in COPD-related emergency department attendances (IRR 0.54, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.81). CONCLUSIONS: The UK-wide lockdown was associated with the most substantial reductions in COPD exacerbations ever seen across Scotland and Wales, with no corresponding increase in COPD deaths. This may have resulted from reduced transmission of respiratory infections, reduced exposure to outdoor air pollution and/or improved COPD self-management.","Alsallakh, Mohammad A; Sivakumaran, Shanya; Kennedy, Sharon; Vasileiou, Eleftheria; Lyons, Ronan A; Robertson, Chris; Sheikh, Aziz; Davies, Gwyneth A",BMC Med,,839
268060,On the Legitimacy of the Government's Regulations Issued to Contrast the Coronavirus Emergency,2020,"The fight against the novel coronavirus pneumonia (namely COVID-19) that seriously harms human health is a common task for all mankind. Currently, development of drugs against the novel coronavirus (namely SARS-CoV-2) is quite urgent. Chinese medical workers and scientific researchers have found some drugs to play potential therapeutic effects on COVID-19 at the cellular level or in preliminary clinical trials. However, more fundamental studies and large sample clinical trials need to be done to ensure the efficacy and safety of these drugs. The adoption of these drugs without further testing must be careful. The relevant articles, news, and government reports published on the official and Preprint websites, PubMed and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases from December 2019 to April 2020 were searched and manually filtered. The general pharmacological characteristics, indications, adverse reactions, general usage, and especially current status of the treatment of COVID-19 of those potentially effective drugs, including chemical drugs, traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs), and biological products in China were summarized in this review to guide reasonable medication and the development of specific drugs for the treatment of COVID-19.","Pan, Xiaoqi; Dong, Lan; Yang, Lian; Chen, Dayi; Peng, Cheng",Virus Res,,839

273840,On symbols and scripts: The politics of the American COVID-19 response,2021,"Purpose : To identify the impact the COVID-19 lockdown had on the presentation and management of sight-threatening ocular trauma. Methods : A retrospective cohort analysis of all patients who presented to the Ophthalmology department of Royal Hallamshire Hospital Sheffield with serious ocular trauma during the COVID-19 lockdown period was performed. Data on mechanism of injury and date of injury, presentation, and surgical repair were collected. This process was repeated for the same dates in the previous 5 years for comparison. Results : During the COVID-19 lockdown period, we saw 10 cases of serious ocular trauma (4 globe ruptures, 4 full-thickness lid lacerations, and 2 intra-ocular foreign bodies). This is 3.33 times the average number of cases over the previous 5 years. The delay between injury and presentation rose to 1.1 days compared to 0.33 days pre-COVID; however, the time taken between presentation to surgery was only slightly affected (12 hours in 2020 compared to 11.38 hours pre-COVID). Conclusion : During the COVID-19 lockdown, the number of serious ocular trauma cases was more than three times the average of the previous 5 years. This increase is partially due to more DIY injuries as people stayed at home, but also surprisingly an increase in falls. There did appear to be a longer delay between injury and presentation, suggesting that patients were reluctant to come into hospital during the pandemic. Surgery was performed within 12 hours on average for both groups, reassuringly indicating that sight-saving surgery was not delayed despite extraordinary circumstances.","Stedman, Emily N; Jefferis, Joanna M; Tan, Jennifer H",Ophthalmic Epidemiol,,839
281047,Covid-19: Ethical Criteria,2020,"BACKGROUND: Simulation-based education (SBE) has many benefits for learners, but costs can limit embedding SBE in health professional curricula. Peer simulation involves students portraying patient roles, and may reduce costs while still providing the benefits of other SBE experiences. However, the quality of the SBE may be impacted if students cannot portray authentic and realistic patient roles. The aim of this study was to investigate whether targeted education was associated with observable changes to physiotherapy students' abilities to portray patient roles in SBE. METHODS: Second year pre-registration physiotherapy students (n = 40) participated. Students completed online and face-to-face education about SBE, patient portrayal skills, and how to portray a specific patient role. Students were video-recorded portraying patient roles in practical exams before and after the program. Three blinded independent assessors rated the overall quality of portrayals using a purpose-developed assessment instrument. RESULTS: Twenty-three sets of pre- and post-program videos were analysed. Correlations between assessor scores spanned 0.62 to 0.82 for analyses of interest, which justified using average assessor ratings in analysis. Statistically significant higher scores were seen for post-program assessments for overall portrayal scores (mean difference 6.5, 95%CI [1.51-11.45], p = 0.013), accuracy (mean difference 3.4, 95%CI [0.69-6.13], p = 0.016) and quality (mean difference 3.1, 95%CI [0.64-5.49], p = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS: Physiotherapy students appear capable of playing realistic patient roles. Peer simulation can be embedded into health professional programs, and education in patient role portrayal appears to be associated with improvements in portrayal quality and realism. Given these findings, further investigation, including testing program effects in a randomised study, is warranted.","Pritchard, Shane A; Keating, Jennifer L; Nestel, Debra; Blackstock, Felicity C",BMC Med Educ,,839
283347,The Brazilian government's actions against the CoViD-19,2020,"The aim of this study was to assess the differences in internalized-stigma, self-esteem, hope, and quality of life in individuals with mental illness from two diverse cultures (Bedouins and Jews) and to examine the relationships between self-stigma and self-esteem, hope, and quality of life in participants from both cultures. Two hundred participants with mental illness in Israel were assessed on the Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness (ISMI) scale. The Arab Bedouin participants tended to internalize stigma to a greater extent than the Jewish participants. Overall, there was a significant negative correlation between self-stigma, self-esteem, and hope and between alienation and quality of life in both groups although the correlation was stronger among the Arab Bedouin participants. By contrast, the associations between self-stigma and quality of life were only significant for two of the self-stigma dimensions (alienation and discrimination) among the Jewish participants. These results contribute to a better understanding of the role internalized stigma may play in the life of people with mental illness from diverse cultures. They may help design culturally appropriate intervention programs for people with mental illness.","Manor-Binyamini, Iris",Psychiatr. q,,839

The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the available data on the safety and efficacy of influenza vaccination in cancer patients receiving ICIs. METHODS: Studies reporting safety and efficacy outcomes of influenza vaccination in cancer patients receiving ICIs were included. Only descriptive statistics were conducted to obtain a pooled rate of immune-related adverse events in vaccinated patients. RESULTS: Ten studies assessing the safety and eight assessing the efficacy of influenza vaccination in cancer patients receiving ICIs were identified, for a total of 1124 and 986 vaccinated patients, respectively. Most patients had melanoma or lung cancer and received a single agent anti-PD-1, but also other tumour types and immunotherapy combinations were represented. No severe vaccination-related toxicities were reported. The pooled incidence of any grade immune checkpoint inhibitor-related adverse events was 28.9%. In the 6 studies specifying the incidence of grade 3-4 toxicities, the pooled incidence was 7.5%. No grade 5 toxicities were reported. No pooled descriptive analysis was conducted in studies reporting efficacy outcomes due to the heterogeneity of endpoints and data reporting. Nevertheless, among the eight studies included, seven reported positive efficacy outcomes of influenza vaccination. CONCLUSION: The results of this systematic review support the safety and efficacy of influenza vaccination in cancer patients receiving ICIs. These results are particularly relevant in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Spagnolo, Francesco; Boutros, Andrea; Croce, Elena; Cecchi, Federica; Arecco, Luca; Tanda, Enrica; Pronzato, Paolo; Lambertini, Matteo",Eur J Clin Invest,,839

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventeen patients with 2019-nCoV in Zhengzhou People's Hospital from February to March 2020 were collected. Their epidemiology, clinical symptoms, laboratory examinations, and chest CT images were reviewed. All 17 patients were aged between 12-83 years, with an average age of 47 years, and consisted of 10 males (58.8%) and 7 females (41.2%). Two patients had histories of living or traveling in Wuhan, and 9 patients were attacked locally. The 6 remaining patients were unknown about incidence reasons. RESULTS: The average incubation period was 10 days, and the average time of the course of the disease was 9 days. Among the participants, 12 patients had fever as the first symptoms and 5 patients had normal body temperature. One patient was symptom-free carrier, and one patient had serious symptoms. One patient developed from mild symptoms to severe symptoms, and 14 patients had mild symptoms. Moreover, 7 patients had complications of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and hypertension, 1 patient was in the advanced stage of squamous cell lung carcinoma, and 1 patient had diabetes mellitus, renal failure, and late-stage uremia. According to novel coronavirus nucleic acid test, 8 patients were positive, accounting for 47.1%. All patients were negative in the novel coronavirus IgM antibody test and negative in other common respiratory pathogen detection. All 17 patients had ground glass-like high-density shadow or stripped high-density shadow on lung CT images, accompanied with many affected lesions on two lungs. The average stay in hospital was 10 days, and the average time of the course of the disease was 9 days. After hospitalization, 15 patients were discharged from the hospital upon recovery, 1 patient was transferred to superior hospital for continuous treatment, and 1 patient died. Patients with 2019-nCoV in Zhengzhou People's Hospital were mainly attacked in local areas, and most of them had mild symptoms. The positive rate of the nucleic acid test was 47.1%. CONCLUSIONS: The main clinical characteristics are increased neutrophil granulocytes, increased C-reactive proteins, decreased lymphocytes, ground glass-like or stripped lesions on lung CT image, common complications of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, and favorable prognosis.","Song, Y-S; Hao, Y-B; Liu, W-W; Zhang, S-S; Wang, P; Fan, T-L",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,839

Several previous studies have reported on the extent of stem migration and its influence on clinical outcome. However, no studies have investigated the influence of stem migration on Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROM). METHODS: One hundred and twelve total hip arthroplasties (THA) were included in a 2-year follow-up using Radiostereometric Analysis (RSA). Patients were evaluated using the Oxford Hip Score (OHS) and EQ-5D-3L PROMs. The purpose of this study was to assess the influence of stem migration, measured by Maximum Total Point Motion (MTPM), on the 2-year postoperative score (OHS and EQ-5D). Furthermore, the influence of pre-operative PROM, age, gender, acetabular component and BMI was associated with the 2-year postoperative OHS and EQ-5D scores. RESULTS: MTPM was a non-significant predictor of the 2-year postoperative OHS (regression coefficient (B) = - 2.38 (CI - 5.44; .69)) and of the 2-year postoperative EQ-5D (B = - .01 (CI - .04; .02)). The only significant predictor of the 2-year postoperative OHS and 2-year postoperative EQ-5D was gender (B = 8.71 (CI 3.52; 13.90)) and (B = .13 (CI .07; .18)), respectively. CONCLUSION: Stem migration did not significantly influence PROMs at 2 years post-operatively. Using a patient-focused approach, our results seem to corroborate results reported by previous studies, showing that slow migration of the Exeter V40 stem does not seem to influence the clinical outcome.","Steiner, Daniel K; Drivsholm, Nikolaj S; Buchardt, Sebastian T E; Laursen, Mogens",Eur. j. orthop. surg. traumatol,,839
424038,Do medical interns feel prepared to work in the COVID-19 pandemic?,2020,"BACKGROUND: The aim was to examine the correlates of increased alcohol consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions that were implemented in a sample of UK adults. METHODS: This paper presents analyses of data from a cross-sectional study. Adults aged 18 years and over, residing in the UK and self-isolating from others outside their own household were eligible to participate. Participants reported increase or no increase in their level of alcohol consumption from before to during lockdown, as well as symptoms of anxiety, depression and mental wellbeing. Socio-demographic characteristics were compared between adults with and without reported increased alcohol consumption. The associations between reported increased alcohol consumption and mental health outcomes were investigated using logistic and linear regression analyses. RESULTS: 691 adults (61.1 % women; 48.8 % aged 35-64 years) were included in the analysis. Of these, 17 % reported increased alcohol consumption after lockdown. A higher proportion of 18-34-year olds reported increased alcohol consumption compared to older groups. The prevalence of poor overall mental health was significantly higher in individuals with increased alcohol consumption (vs. no increase) (45.4 % versus 32.7 %; p-value = 0.01). There was a significant association between increased alcohol consumption and poor overall mental health (OR = 1.64; 95 % CI = 1.01, 2.66), depressive symptoms (unstandardized beta = 2.93; 95 % CI = 0.91, 4.95) and mental wellbeing (unstandardized beta=-1.38; 95 % CI=-2.38, -0.39). CONCLUSIONS: More than one in six UK adults increased their alcohol consumption during lockdown and a higher proportion of these were younger adults. Increased alcohol consumption was independently associated with poor overall mental health, increased depressive symptoms and lower mental wellbeing. These findings highlight the importance of planning targeted support as we emerge from lockdown and plan for potential second and subsequent waves.","Jacob, Louis; Smith, Lee; Armstrong, Nicola C; Yakkundi, Anita; Barnett, Yvonne; Butler, Laurie; McDermott, Daragh T; Koyanagi, Ai; Shin, Jae Il; Meyer, Jacob; Firth, Joseph; Remes, Olivia; López-Sánchez, Guillermo F; Tully, Mark A",Drug Alcohol Depend,,839

476974,The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on levels of physical fitness,2020,"This paper addresses the question of how the position of Indian states in terms of their approach to welfare state policies interacts with the centre–state relationships that characterize health policymaking. In India’s version of federalism, health policymaking has been influenced by four mutually interacting sources: international public health discourses;Indian government programmes and policies;civil society organizations concerned with health;and the political economy of the different states and their associated political regimes. Public health issues sometimes achieve a high policy profile at the government of India, but very rarely do so at state level. This divergence provides fertile spaces for negotiation and conflict. An analysis of the path dependency of the allocation of health functions to different national and subnational levels of government contextualizes a case study of the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM), 2004–14. This shows the limits to the central government’s ability to implement a universalizing, rights-based programme across the country. An explanation for the different outcomes can be found in the variety of state systems within the country. Finally, the paper assesses whether the changes introduced since 2014 show a new federal order in the making and provides preliminary insights from state responses to the 2020 Covid-19 outbreak. © 2021 Regional Studies Association.","Jeffery, R.","Territory, Politics, Governance",,839

The virus responsible for COVID-19 disease is 'severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2' SARS-CoV-2, an enveloped RNA beta-coronavirus from the family Coronaviridae. There have been similar beta-coronavirus disease outbreaks previously: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS - 2002) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS - 2012) epidemics. SARS-CoV-2 origins have been traced to bat reservoirs. A virus with a high capacity for mutation, SARS-CoV-2 poses unique challenges both in the current form of disease control and management, while also leaving the door open for future novel diseases and pandemics. An understanding of the virion structure and genomic organisation will help us in understanding their origins and likely course of future evolution. Moreover, novel cost-effective methodologies for genetic surveillance may help in mitigating the emergence of these viral infections in future. In this manuscript, the authors have detailed the unique aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 virus genome and its clinical implications.","Thomas, Vineeth; Audsley, Jennifer; Kapoor, Nitin",J Pak Med Assoc,,839
521762,Guidance on breastfeeding during the Covid-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic led to unprecedented mitigation efforts that disrupted the daily lives of millions. Beyond the general health repercussions of the pandemic itself, these measures also present a significant challenge to the world's mental health and healthcare systems. Considering traditional survey methods are time-consuming and expensive, we need timely and proactive data sources to respond to the rapidly evolving effects of health policy on our population's mental health. Significant pluralities of the US population now use social media platforms, such as Twitter, to express the most minute details of their daily lives and social relations. This behavior is expected to increase during the COVID-19 pandemic, rendering social media data a rich field from which to understand personal wellbeing. OBJECTIVE: Broadly, this study answers three research questions: RQ1: What themes emerge from a corpus of US tweets about COVID-19?; RQ2: To what extent does social media use increase during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic?; and RQ3: Does sentiment change in response to the COVID-19 pandemic? METHODS: We analyzed 86,581,237 public domain English-language US tweets collected from an open-access public repository (Chen, Lerman, & Ferrara, 2020) in three steps. First, we characterized the evolution of hashtags over time using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling. Second, we increased the granularity of this analysis by downloading Twitter timelines of a large cohort of individuals (n = 354,738) in 20 major US cities to assess changes in social media use. Finally, using this timeline data, we examined collective shifts in public mood in relation to evolving pandemic news cycles by analyzing the average daily sentiment of all timeline tweets with the Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER) (Hutto & Gilbert, 2014) sentiment tool. RESULTS: LDA topics generated in the early months of the dataset corresponded to major COVID-19 specific events. However, as state and municipal governments began issuing stay-at-home orders, latent themes shifted towards US-related lifestyle changes rather than global pandemic-related events. Social media volume also increased significantly, peaking during stay-at-home mandates. Finally, VADER sentiment analysis sentiment scores of user timelines were initially high and stable, but decreased significantly, and continuously, by late March. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings underscore the negative effects of the pandemic on overall population sentiment. Increased usage rates suggest that, for some, social media may be a coping mechanism to combat feelings of isolation related to long-term social distancing. However, in light of the documented negative effect of heavy social media usage on mental health, for many social media may further exacerbate negative feelings in the long-term. Thus, considering the overburdened US mental healthcare structure, these findings have important implications for ongoing mitigation efforts.","Valdez, Danny; Ten Thij, Marijn; Bathina, Krishna; Rutter, Lauren Alexandra; Bollen, Johan",J. med. internet res,,839

It is rich in nutrients and can be used as medicine or food. The present study is performed to evaluate the quality of Lanzhou lily by Raman spectroscopy. Here, Raman spectra of lily bulbs were collected by confocal Raman microscopy. Through study of a variety of samples, we found that Raman peaks of several important nutrients including starch, sucrose and amino acids were clearly observed from scales of lily bulb, while strong characteristic peaks of ferulic acid were observed at the epidermis of the same scale due to the stimulation of the external environment. We also compared lily bulbs with various sizes and shapes using an average Raman spectrum of selected area. Then, changes of nutrients were quantitively analyzed in different storage period. The results show that the nutrient components including starch, sucrose, amino acids and ferulic acid can be evaluated by Raman spectroscopy. Then the quality of Lanzhou lily can be evaluated by Raman spectroscopy. This is valuable for quality evaluation of lily using non-destructive methods.","Li, Yuee; Wang, Huihui; Zhang, Wenbo; Wu, Haining; Wang, Zhong",Spectrochim Acta A Mol Biomol Spectrosc,,839

Therefore, prediction of peptide–MHC binding is the main basis for anticipating T-cell epitopes. A very popular and accurate method to predict peptide–MHC binding is based on motif-profiles and here we show how to make them using EPIMHC (http://imed.med.ucm.es/epimhc/). EPIMHC is a database of T-cell epitopes and MHC-binding peptides that unlike any related resource provides a framework for computational vaccinology. In this chapter, we describe how to derive peptide–MHC binding motif-profiles in EPIMHC and use them to predict peptide–MHC binding and T-cell epitopes. Moreover, we show evidence that customization of peptide–MHC binding predictors can lead to enhanced epitope predictions.","Molero-Abraham, Magdalena; Lafuente, Esther M.; Reche, Pedro",Immunoinformatics,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-1115-8_18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25048133/,839

611701,Female students are the most psychologically affected by the COVID-19 outbreak: a case study in an academic community in Brazil,2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) recently emerged as a highly virulent respiratory pathogen that is known as the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Diarrhea is a common early symptom in a significant proportion of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 can infect and replicate in esophageal cells and enterocytes, leading to direct damage to the intestinal epithelium. The infection decreases the level of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors, thereby altering the composition of the gut microbiota. SARS-CoV-2 elicits a cytokine storm, which contributes to gastrointestinal inflammation. The direct cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV-2, gut dysbiosis, and aberrant immune response result in increased intestinal permeability, which may exacerbate existing symptoms and worsen the prognosis. By exploring the elements of pathogenesis, several therapeutic options have emerged for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, such as biologics and biotherapeutic agents. However, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the feces may facilitate the spread of COVID-19 through fecal-oral transmission and contaminate the environment. Thus gastrointestinal SARS-CoV-2 infection has important epidemiological significance. The development of new therapeutic and preventive options is necessary to treat and restrict the spread of this severe and widespread infection more effectively. Therefore, we summarize the key elements involved in the pathogenesis and the epidemiology of COVID-19-associated diarrhea.","Megyeri, Klara; Dernovics, Áron; Al-Luhaibi, Zaid I I; Rosztóczy, András",World J Gastroenterol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34163106/; https://doi.org/10.3748/wjg.v27.i23.3208,839

However, no data is available regarding the effect of repeated F/T cycles on SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection in serum. We investigated the effect of multiple F/T cycles on anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG detection using an ELISA test targeting the nucleocapsid antibodies. Ten positive and one negative SARS-CoV-2 IgG sera from 11 participants, in replicates of five were subjected to a total of 16 F/T cycles and stored at 4 degrees celsius until tested by ELISA. Statistical analysis was done to test for F/T cycle effect. Non-of the 10 positive sera turned into negative after 16 F/T cycles. There was no significant difference in the OD average reading between the first and last F/T cycles, except for one serum with a minimal decline in the OD. The random-effect linear regression of log (OD) on the number of cycles showed no significant trend with a slope consistent with zero (B=-0.0001; 95% CI -0.0008; 0.0006; p-value=0.781).

We performed real‐time polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) follow‐up studies on recovered patients to assess possible development of reinfections and re‐positivity. METHODS: During a 6‐month period, 202 PCR‐confirmed recovering COVID‐19 patients entered this study. Follow‐up RT‐PCR tests and symptom assessment were performed 1 month after the initial positive results. Patients who tested negative were tested again 1 and 3 months later. The serum IgG and IgM levels were measured in the last follow‐up session. RESULTS: In the first two follow‐up sessions, 82 patients continued their participation, of which four patients tested positive. In the second follow‐up 44 patients participated, three of whom tested positive. None of the patients who tested positive in the first and second follow‐up session were symptomatic. In the last session, 32 patients were tested and four patients were positive, three of them were mildly symptomatic and all of them were positive for IgG. CONCLUSIONS: A positive RT‐PCR in a recovering patient may represent reinfection. While we did not have the resources to prove reinfection by genetic sequencing of the infective viruses, we believe presence of mild symptoms in the three patients who tested positive over 100 days after becoming asymptomatic, can be diagnosed as reinfection. The immune response developed during the first episode of infection (e.g., IgG or T‐cell mediated responses that were not measured in our study) may have abated the symptoms of the reinfection, without providing complete protection.","Sadr, Sara; Bafrani, Melika Arab; Abdollahi, Alireza; SeyedAlinaghi, Seyed Ahmad; Mohammadnejad, Esmaeil; Hossienzade, Roghieh; ShahmariGolestan, Fereshteh; Ahmadinejad, Zahra; Salehi, Mohamadreza; Javaherian, Mohammad; Kimyaee, Elahe; Jafari, Fatemeh; Ghiasvand, Fereshteh",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12883; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34296828/,839
631123,Physical activity practice during COVID-19 pandemic in patients with intermittent claudication.,2021,"Although synthetic bioactive compounds are approved in many countries for food applications, they are becoming less and less welcome by consumers. Therefore, there has been an increasing interest in replacing these synthetic compounds by natural bioactive compounds. These natural compounds can be used as food additives to maintain the food quality, food safety and appeal, and as food supplements or nutraceuticals to correct nutritional deficiencies, maintain a suitable intake of nutrients, or to support physiological functions, respectively. Recent studies reveal that numerous food wastes, particularly fruit and vegetables byproducts, are a good source of bioactive compounds that can be extracted and reintroduced into the food chain as natural food additives or in food matrices for obtaining nutraceuticals and functional foods. This review addresses general questions concerning the use of fruit and vegetables byproducts as new sources of natural bioactive compounds that are being addressed to foods as natural additives and supplements. Those bioactive compounds must follow the legal requirements and evaluations to assess the risks for human health and their toxicity must be considered before being launched into the market. To overcome the potential health risk while increasing the biological activity, stability and biodistribution of the supplements’ technological alternatives have been studied such as encapsulation of bioactive compounds into micro or nanoparticles or nanoemulsions. This will allow enhancing the stability and release along the gastrointestinal tract in a controlled manner into the specific tissues. This review summarizes the valorization path that a bioactive compound recovered from an agro-food waste can face from the moment their potentialities are exhibited until it reaches the final consumer and the safety and toxicity challenges, they may overcome.","Vilas-Boas, Ana A.; Pintado, Manuela; Oliveira, Ana L.

Mutant spectra are continuously and avoidably generated during RNA genome replication, and they are not just a by-product of error-prone replication, devoid of biological relevance. On the contrary, current evidence indicates that mutant spectra contribute to viral pathogenesis, can modulate the expression of phenotypic traits by subpopulations of viruses, can include memory genomes that reflect the past evolutionary history of the viral lineage, and, furthermore, can participate in viral extinction through lethal mutagenesis. Also, mutant spectra are the target on which selection and random drift act to shape the long-term evolution of viruses.

Specifically, Statistical Neural Networks (Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN), Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN)), and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) are applied to develop the COVID-19 Mortality Rate Prediction (MRP) model for India. For that purpose, there are two types of dataset used in this study: One is COVID-19 Death cases, a Time Series Data and the other is COVID-19 Confirmed Case and Death Cases where Death case is dependent variable and the Confirmed case is an independent variable. Hyperparameter optimization or tuning is used in these regression models, which is the process of identifying a set of optimal hyperparameters for any learning process with minimal error. Here, sigma (σ) is a hyperparameter whose value is used to constrain the learning process of the above models with minimum Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The performance of the models is evaluated using the RMSE and 'R2 values, which shows that the GRP model performs better than the GRNN and RBFNN.","Dhamodharavadhani, S; Rathipriya, R",Afr Health Sci,https://doi.org/10.4314/ahs.v21i1.26; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394298/,839
