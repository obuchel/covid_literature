2379,Global Transcriptional Profiling of Diapause and Climatic Adaptation in Drosophila melanogaster,2015-11-13,"Wild populations of the model organism Drosophila melanogaster experience highly heterogeneous environments over broad geographical ranges as well as over seasonal and annual timescales. Diapause is a primary adaptation to environmental heterogeneity, and in D. melanogaster the propensity to enter diapause varies predictably with latitude and season. Here we performed global transcriptomic profiling of naturally occurring variation in diapause expression elicited by short day photoperiod and moderately low temperature in two tissue types associated with neuroendocrine and endocrine signaling, heads, and ovaries. We show that diapause in D. melanogaster is an actively regulated phenotype at the transcriptional level, suggesting that diapause is not a simple physiological or reproductive quiescence. Differentially expressed genes and pathways are highly distinct in heads and ovaries, demonstrating that the diapause response is not uniform throughout the soma and suggesting that it may be comprised of functional modules associated with specific tissues. Genes downregulated in heads of diapausing flies are significantly enriched for clinally varying single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) and seasonally oscillating SNPs, consistent with the hypothesis that diapause is a driving phenotype of climatic adaptation. We also show that chromosome location-based coregulation of gene expression is present in the transcriptional regulation of diapause. Taken together, these results demonstrate that diapause is a complex phenotype actively regulated in multiple tissues, and support the hypothesis that natural variation in diapause propensity underlies adaptation to spatially and temporally varying selective pressures.","Zhao, Xiaqing; Bergland, Alan O.; Behrman, Emily L.; Gregory, Brian D.; Petrov, Dmitri A.; Schmidt, Paul S.",Molecular Biology and Evolution,https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article-pdf/33/3/707/17471430/msv263.pdf,354
2738,miR‐127‐5p negatively regulates enterovirus 71 replication by directly targeting SCARB2,2017-04-13,"Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is the major causative agent of hand‐foot‐and‐mouth disease in young children and can cause severe cerebral and pulmonary complications and even fatality. This study aimed at elucidating whether and how EV71 infection is regulated by a cellular microRNA, miR‐127‐5p. We found that miR‐127‐5p can downregulate the expression of SCARB2, a main receptor of EV71, by targeting two potential sites in its 3′ UTR region and inhibit EV71 infection. Meanwhile, miR‐127‐5p expression was upregulated during EV71 infection. Notably, transfecting cells with miR‐127‐5p mimics led to a significant decrease in viral replication, while inhibition of endogenous miR‐127‐5p facilitated viral replication. Furthermore, our evidence showed that miR‐127‐5p did not affect postentry viral replication. Taken together, these results indicated that miR‐127‐5p inhibited EV71 replication by targeting the SCARB2 mRNA.","Feng, Chunhong; Fu, Yuxuan; Chen, Deyan; Wang, Huanru; Su, Airong; Zhang, Li; Chang, Liang; Zheng, Nan; Wu, Zhiwei",FEBS Open Bio,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5458453/,354

5103,Enhanced photocatalytic inactivation of bacterial spores on surfaces in air,2005-07-26,"Virions resembling papovavirus were demonstrated in glial cells in the brain of an aged patient without overt progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. The patient was not in a severely immunocompromised state. On histological examination, only a few tiny incomplete necrotic foci were found in the subcortical area. These foci were widely dispersed. Rare, swollen oligodendroglial cells and astrocytes in which papovavirus capsid protein (VP-1) was demonstrated immunohistochemically were present around the foci. The two typical types of virus particles i.e. 35 to 40 nm round particles and elongated particles, were observed in the nuclei of the swollen glial cells. The latter were in the minority. Distinct crystals were also found in the nuclei. The centre-to-centre distance of the particles in the crystals, about 40 nm, and the electron-opaque spots of the round-shaped virions and of the elongated particles, were indicative of structural subunits of papovavirus capsids. This case provides further evidence that papovavirus, possibly JC virus, may be reactivated in the brains of aged patients who are not in an immunocompromised state.","Shimada, H.; Noda, K.; Mori, M.; Aoki, N.; Tajima, M.; Kato, K.",Virchows Arch,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087722/,354

6211,In the News,2004,"Nucleic acid aptamers can be selected from pools of random-sequence oligonucleotides to bind a wide range of biomedically relevant proteins with affinities and specificities that are comparable to antibodies. Aptamers exhibit significant advantages relative to protein therapeutics in terms of size, synthetic accessibility and modification by medicinal chemistry. Despite these properties, aptamers have been slow to reach the marketplace, with only one aptamer-based drug receiving approval so far. A series of aptamers currently in development may change how nucleic acid therapeutics are perceived. It is likely that in the future, aptamers will increasingly find use in concert with other therapeutic molecules and modalities.","Keefe, Anthony D.; Pai, Supriya; Ellington, Andrew",Nat Rev Drug Discov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7097324/,354
6236,Community engagement,2013-03-15,"Vaccination has achieved remarkable successes in the control of childhood viral diseases. To control emerging infections, however, vaccines will need to be delivered to older individuals who, unlike infants, probably have had prior infection or vaccination with related viruses and thus have cross-reactive antibodies against the vaccines. Whether and how these cross-reactive antibodies impact live attenuated vaccination efficacy is unclear. Using an open-label randomized trial design, we show that subjects with a specific range of cross-reactive antibody titres from a prior inactivated Japanese encephalitis vaccination enhanced yellow fever (YF) immunogenicity upon YF vaccination. Enhancing titres of cross-reactive antibodies prolonged YF vaccine viraemia, provoked greater pro-inflammatory responses, and induced adhesion molecules intrinsic to the activating Fc-receptor signalling pathway, namely immune semaphorins, facilitating immune cell interactions and trafficking. Our findings clinically demonstrate antibody-enhanced infection and suggest that vaccine efficacy could be improved by exploiting cross-reactive antibodies.

6243,Viral shape-shifting: norovirus evasion of the human immune system,2010-02-02,"Many pathological changes in solid tumours are caused by the accumulation of genetic mutations and epigenetic molecular alterations. In addition, tumour progression is profoundly influenced by the environment surrounding the transformed cells. The interplay between tumour cells and their microenvironment has been recognized as one of the key determinants of cancer development and is being extensively investigated. Data suggest that both the extracellular matrix and the microbiota represent microenvironments that contribute to the onset and progression of tumours. Through the introduction of omics technologies and pyrosequencing analyses, a detailed investigation of these two microenvironments is now possible. In urological research, assessment of their dysregulation has become increasingly important to provide diagnostic, prognostic and predictive biomarkers for urothelial bladder cancer. Understanding the roles of the extracellular matrix and microbiota, two key components of the urothelial mucosa, in the sequelae of pathogenic events that occur in the development and progression of urothelial carcinomas will be important to overcome the shortcomings in current bladder cancer treatment strategies.

8383,"Author index volume 5, 2004",2004-11-13,"FUNDAMENTALS: Many asthma exacerbations are caused by respiratory viral infections that induce the interplay between Th1 and Th2 immune responses. However, the time trends for Th1 and Th2 immune responses during these phenomena have not been well studied. OBJECTIVE: To identify possible mechanisms underlying the link between respiratory viral infections and asthma exacerbations. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We recruited 40 adults aged 21-58 years for 4 groups. A. Healthy, B. Healthy with viral infection, C. Mild to moderate asthma and D. Same as C, but with viral infection. Th1 and Th2 cytokines in induced sputum samples during the course of acute upper respiratory viral infections in otherwise healthy and asthmatic individuals were monitored. IL-4, IL-5 and IFN-γ were assayed by ELISA. Viral infection symptoms and asthma severity scores were monitored. Time trends were analyzed using linear mixed models. RESULTS: IL-4 and IL-5 levels in groups C and D were higher than in groups A and B. IFN-γ levels and viral infection symptoms scores in group B spiked by day 2 and rapidly declined by day 7, while in group D, IFN-γ and symptoms scores for viral infection and asthma peaked much later (days 3-5) and slowly declined. The ratios of IL-4 and IL-5 to IFN-γ in group D were significantly higher than in group C. CONCLUSIONS: Infection-induced asthma exacerbations may be due to impaired anti-viral Th1-immune responses. There appears to be a critical window of 3-5 days for therapeutic intervention.","Zhang, Ding; Xia, Jingwen; Chen, Xiaodong",Arch Bronconeumol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7129655/,354

Full-length (protein product designated A) and C-terminal truncated (protein product designated B) serotype 3 reovirus Sl mRNA transcripts synthesizedin vitro were cotranslated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate, and the products were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) under conditions which allowed for the identification of oligomeric forms of σl. A total of four oligomeric protein bands (corresponding to A(3), A(2)B(1), A(1)B(2), and B3, respectively) was consistently observed, which suggests that the protein is made up of three monomeric subunits. Biophysical characterization of purified σ1 using column filtration and sucrose gradient sedimentation analysis confirmed the highly asymmetric shape of σ1 and allowed us to determine the molecular weight of the native protein to be ∼132K (a trimer). Similar biophysical analysis on the two tryptic fragments of the σ1 [N-terminal fibrous tail (26K monomeric molecular weight) and the C-terminal globular head (23K monomeric molecular weight)] yielded molecular weights of 77K and 64K, respectively, both again corresponding to trimers. We therefore conclude that protein σ1 is a homotrimer and provide, with supportive experimental evidence, a rationale for the anomalous behavior of the oligomeric protein in SDS-polyacrylamide gels, which, coupled with chemical cross-linking studies, has in part led to the previous suggestion that σ1 might be a higher order oligomer.","Strong, James E.; Leone, Gustavo; Duncan, Roy; Sharma, Rajendra K.; Lee, Patrick W.K.",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130766/,354

Ribavirin was administered daily for 10 to 14 days at 16·5 mg kg(−1) bodyweight given per os, intramuscularly or intravenously beginning 18 hours after kittens were challenge-exposed with fipv. All kittens, including ribavirin-treated and untreated kittens, succumbed to FIP. Clinical signs of disease were more severe in the ribavirin-treated kittens and their mean survival times were shortened. The clinical efficacy of free ribavirin given intravenously at a reduced dosage (5·5 mg kg(−1) bodyweight) was compared to that of ribavirin incorporated into lecithin-containing liposomes (5 mg kg(−1)) intravenously. Drugs were given once daily for three consecutive days of each week for three weeks, beginning 18 hours after virus challenge exposure. There was no significant difference either in survival rate or severity of disease between kittens given free ribavirin, liposomal ribavirin or saline only. Because of its intrinsic toxicity and low therapeutic index against fipv and its marginal antiviral activities in vivo at maximal doses, ribavirin cannot presently be recommended as primary antiviral chemotherapy against fip.","Weiss, R.C.; Cox, N.R.; Martinez, M.L.",Res Vet Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131103/,354

From this subdivision the model estimates a number of topographic attributes for each element including the total upslope contributing area, element area, slope, and aspect. This form of discretization of a catchment produces natural units for problems involving water flow as either a surface or subsurface flow phenomenon. The model therefore has wide potential application for representing the three‐dimensionality of natural terrain and water flow processes in the fields of hydrology, sedimentology, and geomorphology. Three example applications are presented and discussed. They are the prediction of zones of surface saturation, the prediction of the distribution of potential daily solar radiation, and the prediction of zones of erosion and deposition in a catchment.","Moore, I.

9736,THE EFFECTS OF BIOTIN ADMINISTRATION ON GLUCOSE SYNTHESIS RATES IN STARVED PREGNANT SHEEP,2008-03-10,"Disease is one of the main threats to the remaining great ape populations of the world. The decision to intervene in the health of the great apes for population sustainability is controversial. Humans' increasing negative influence on great ape health has mandated the reevaluation of current management policies. The Mountain Gorilla Veterinary Project (MGVP) has been making health intervention decisions since 1986. The decision to intervene has often been made subjectively due to poorly defined criteria that are often influenced by emotion. This paper provides a consistent framework for evidence‐based health intervention decision‐making. The decision tree is a five‐tier process consisting of routine sentinel health observation, intensive follow‐up veterinary health observation, outbreak assessment, risk assessment, and risk management. Although this paper focuses on the mountain gorillas, it serves as a basis for evidence‐based decision‐making in other species. Am. J.

Encephalitis occurred most commonly in children 1 to 1.9 years of age, among whom the incidence was 16.7 per 100,000 child‐years. The incidence remained quite high until the age of 10 years, and then gradually declined to 1.0 per 100,000 child‐years at the age of 15 years. Since 1983, when mumps, measles, and rubella vaccination eradicated the encephalitides associated with these microbes, the major associated agents have been varicella‐zoster, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and respiratory and enteroviruses. In infants younger than 1 year of age, the major agents were enteroviruses, herpes simplex virus, and the group of “others,” whereas in older children, respiratory viruses and Mycoplasma Pneumoniae as well as varicella‐zoster virus, dominated. In children aged 1 to 11 months, the causal agent could not be identified in one‐half of all cases, whereas in children who were at least 10 years old, the etiology remained unknown in only one‐fourth of cases. Male dominance was most evident in the 4‐ to 9‐year age group. The difference in etiology between males and females was significant (p = 0.02); mumps and varicella were more common in boys, and adenovirus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were more common in girls. The overall male‐to‐female ratio was 1.4:1. Characteristic seasonal variation occurred in encephalitides associated with mumps, measles, and entero‐ and respiratory viruses. In the whole series, some accumulation appeared in February and March. Less than one‐half of this number appeared in July and August.","Koskiniemi, Marjaleena; Rautonen, Jukka; Lehtokoski‐Lehtiniemi, Eeva; Vaheri, Antti",Ann Neurol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7159592/,354

Light microscopic pathologic features were consistent with those found in the human disease. Neutrophilic infiltration of synovium was somewhat more prominent than in chronic human RA, and activated lymphocytes in fluid or membrane were less frequent. The proliferative and plasma cell reaction seemed identical. Electron microscopy (EM) suggested microvascular injury with findings which included electron dense deposits in the vessel walls of 2 dogs. Seven dogs had meshworks of 20‐25 mm tubules in tubuloreticular structures (TRS) similar to those seen in human systemic lupus erythematosus and only occasionally in human RA. There were also crystalline arrays of tubules, a configuration previously reported in tumors and virus infections and possibly suggestive of a cellular reaction to virus infection. To date no initiating agent has been identified, but this spontaneous canine disease which is very similar to human RA can provide a valuable model in which to examine pathogenesis of chronic arthritis.","Schumacher, H.

In 4 studies with experts (accountants and actuaries in Studies 1 and 2, respectively) and a diverse lay population (Studies 3 and 4), the evidence was consistent with the highly numerate being more likely than the less numerate to construct their preferences by rating a numerically inferior bet as superior (i.e., the bets effect). Thus, the effect generalizes beyond a college student sample, and preference construction differs by numeracy. Contrary to prior thinking about preference construction, however, high expertise and high ability (rather than low) consistently related to the paradoxical phenomenon. Results across studies including Study 3's experimental modifications of the task supported the hypothesized number comparison process (and not a lack of expertise with monetary outcomes and probabilities or numeracy‐related differences in attention to numbers) as the effect's underlying cause. The bets effect was not attenuated by Study 4's instructions to think about what would be purchased with bet winnings. Task results combined with free‐response coding supported the notion that highly numerate participants have a systematic and persistent inclination for doing simple and complex number operations that drive their judgments (even after controlling for nonnumeric intelligence). Implications for 3 types of dual‐process theories are discussed. The results were inconsistent with default‐interventionist theories, consistent or unclear with respect to fuzzy trace theory, and consistent with interactive theories.","Peters, Ellen; Fennema, M.G.; Tiede, Kevin E.",J Behav Decis Mak,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7161831/,354

DESIGN AND SETTING: Open-label, randomized, pilot study in a university hospital medical intensive care unit and experimental laboratory. PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS: Ten patients with septic shock and eight healthy controls. INTERVENTIONS: Patients (five per group) requiring parenteral nutrition received intravenously either a ω-3 or a ω-6 lipid emulsion for a 10-day period. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: At baseline levels of plasma free fatty acids were elevated several-fold, including high concentrations of the ω-6 lipid precursor arachidonic acid (AA). Neutrophils isolated from septic patients displayed markedly reduced responsiveness to ex vivo stimulation, including lipid mediator generation [leukotrienes (LT), PAF], respiratory burst, and phosphoinositide hydrolysis signaling. Under the ω-6 lipid infusion regimen abnormalities in plasma free fatty acids and impairment of neutrophil functions persisted or worsened. In contrast, a rapid switch in the plasma free fatty acid fraction to predominance of the ω-3 acids eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid over AA occurred in response to ω-3 lipid infusion. LTB(5), in addition to LTB(4), appeared upon neutrophil stimulation originating from these patients, and neutrophil function was significantly improved in the ω-3 lipid group. CONCLUSIONS: ω-3 vs. ω-6 lipid emulsions differentially influence the plasma free fatty acid profile with impact on neutrophil functions. Lipid-based parenteral nutrition in septic patients may thus exert profound influence on sequelae and status of immunocompetence and inflammation.

Methods and Results: MNV, hepatitis A virus (HAV) and HuNoV genogroup I and II (GI and GII) specific real‐time quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)‐PCR assays were used to determine the effects of heat exposure (63 and 72°C) for up to 10 min in water and milk. Using culture assays, MNV and HAV showed similar reductions in infectivity over time. Both HuNoV GI and GII showed lower log reductions in qRT‐PCR titre following heat exposure than either MNV or HAV. No significant protective effect of milk was observed for any virus. Conclusions: MNV is as suitable a surrogate for HuNoV as HAV. In heat inactivation studies at 63 and 72°C, qRT‐PCR results indicate that HuNoV is less susceptible to heat than either HAV or MNV and so neither virus may be an appropriate surrogate for HuNoV. Significance and Impact of the Study: Caution should be used when extrapolating surrogate virus data for HuNoV. Although not conclusive, our results suggest that HuNoV may be more resistant to heat than either HAV or MNV.","Hewitt, J.; Rivera‐Aban, M.; Greening, G.E.",J Appl Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7197740/,354
11303,Viral genomics in Ebola virus research,2020-05-04,"Little is known about the evolution of diaphragmatic function in the early post-cardiac surgery period. The main purpose of this work is to describe its evolution using ultrasound measurements of muscular excursion and thickening fraction (TF). Single-center prospective study of 79 consecutive uncomplicated elective cardiac surgery patients, using motion-mode during quiet unassisted breathing. Excursion and TF were measured sequentially for each patient [pre-operative (D1), 1 day (D2) and 5 days (D3) after surgery]. Pre-operative median for right and left hemidiaphragmatic excursions were 1.8 (IQR 1.6 to 2.1) cm and 1.7 (1.4 to 2.0) cm, respectively. Pre-operative median right and left thickening fractions were 28 (19 to 36) % and 33 (22 to 51) %, respectively. At D2, there was a reduction in both excursion (right: 1.5 (1.1 to 1.8) cm, p < 0.001, left: 1.5 (1.1 to 1.8), p = 0.003) and thickening fractions (right: 20 (15 to 34) %, p = 0.021, left: 24 (17 to 39) %, p = 0.002), followed by a return to pre-operative values at D3. A positive moderate correlation was found between excursion and thickening fraction (Spearman’s rho 0.518 for right and 0.548 for left hemidiaphragm, p < 0.001). Interobserver reliability yielded a bias below 0.1 cm with limits of agreement (LOA) of ± 0.3 cm for excursion and − 2% with LOA of ± 21% for thickening fractions. After cardiac surgery, the evolution of diaphragmatic function is characterized by a transient impairment followed by a quick recovery.

11663,Comparative genomics of Streptococcus parauberis: new target for molecular identification of serotype III,2020-05-21,"Intracranial hypertension (IH) is a clinical condition commonly encountered in the intensive care unit, which requires immediate treatment. The maintenance of normal intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral perfusion pressure in order to prevent secondary brain injury (SBI) is the central focus of management. SBI can be detected through clinical examination and invasive and non-invasive ICP monitoring. Progress in monitoring and understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms of IH allows the implementation of targeted interventions in order to improve the outcome of these patients. Initially, general prophylactic measures such as patient’s head elevation, fever control, adequate analgesia and sedation depth should be applied immediately to all patients with suspected IH. Based on specific indications and conditions, surgical resection of mass lesions and cerebrospinal fluid drainage should be considered as an initial treatment for lowering ICP. Hyperosmolar therapy (mannitol or hypertonic saline) represents the cornerstone of medical treatment of acute IH while hyperventilation should be limited to emergency management of life-threatening raised ICP. Therapeutic hypothermia could have a possible benefit on outcome. To control elevated ICP refractory to maximum standard medical and surgical treatment, at first, high-dose barbiturate administration and then decompressive craniectomy as a last step are recommended with unclear and probable benefit on outcomes, respectively. The therapeutic strategy should be based on a staircase approach and be individualized for each patient. Since most therapeutic interventions have an uncertain effect on neurological outcome and mortality, future research should focus on both studying the long-term benefits of current strategies and developing new ones.","Schizodimos, Theodoros; Soulountsi, Vasiliki; Iasonidou, Christina; Kapravelos, Nikos",J Anesth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7241587/,354

However, biliary stenoses can also be caused by benign conditions, and the identification of their etiology still remains a clinical challenge. We performed metabolomic and proteomic analyses of bile from patients with benign (n = 36) and malignant conditions, CCA (n = 36) or PDAC (n = 57), undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with the aim of characterizing bile composition in biliopancreatic disease and identifying biomarkers for the differential diagnosis of biliary strictures. Comprehensive analyses of lipids, bile acids and small molecules were carried out using mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-NMR) in all patients. MS analysis of bile proteome was performed in five patients per group. We implemented artificial intelligence tools for the selection of biomarkers and algorithms with predictive capacity. Our machine-learning pipeline included the generation of synthetic data with properties of real data, the selection of potential biomarkers (metabolites or proteins) and their analysis with neural networks (NN). Selected biomarkers were then validated with real data. We identified panels of lipids (n = 10) and proteins (n = 5) that when analyzed with NN algorithms discriminated between patients with and without cancer with an unprecedented accuracy.","Urman, Jesús M.; Herranz, José M.; Uriarte, Iker; Rullán, María; Oyón, Daniel; González, Belén; Fernandez-Urién, Ignacio; Carrascosa, Juan; Bolado, Federico; Zabalza, Lucía; Arechederra, María; Alvarez-Sola, Gloria; Colyn, Leticia; Latasa, María U.; Puchades-Carrasco, Leonor; Pineda-Lucena, Antonio; Iraburu, María J.; Iruarrizaga-Lejarreta, Marta; Alonso, Cristina; Sangro, Bruno; Purroy, Ana; Gil, Isabel; Carmona, Lorena; Cubero, Francisco Javier; Martínez-Chantar, María L.; Banales, Jesús M.; Romero, Marta R.; Macias, Rocio I.R.; Monte, Maria J.; Marín, Jose J.

12178,Fumaric acid production by fermentation,2008-03-01,"Conventional processes for lignocellulose-to-organic acid conversion requires pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis, and microbial fermentation. In this study, lime-treated wheat straw was hydrolyzed and fermented simultaneously to lactic acid by an enzyme preparation and Bacillus coagulans DSM 2314. Decrease in pH because of lactic acid formation was partially adjusted by automatic addition of the alkaline substrate. After 55 h of incubation, the polymeric glucan, xylan, and arabinan present in the lime-treated straw were hydrolyzed for 55%, 75%, and 80%, respectively. Lactic acid (40.7 g/l) indicated a fermentation efficiency of 81% and a chiral l(+)-lactic acid purity of 97.2%. In total, 711 g lactic acid was produced out of 2,706 g lime-treated straw, representing 43% of the overall theoretical maximum yield. Approximately half of the lactic acid produced was neutralized by fed-batch feeding of lime-treated straw, whereas the remaining half was neutralized during the batch phase with a Ca(OH)(2) suspension. Of the lime added during the pretreatment of straw, 61% was used for the neutralization of lactic acid. This is the first demonstration of a process having a combined alkaline pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass and pH control in fermentation resulting in a significant saving of lime consumption and avoiding the necessity to recycle lime.","Maas, Ronald H.

12179,Discovery and characterization of a putrescine oxidase from Rhodococcus erythropolis NCIMB 11540,2008-03-01,"The microbial population structure and function of natural anaerobic communities maintained in lab-scale continuously stirred tank reactors at different lactate to sulfate ratios and in the absence of sulfate were analyzed using an integrated approach of molecular techniques and chemical analysis. The population structure, determined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and by the use of oligonucleotide probes, was linked to the functional changes in the reactors. At the influent lactate to sulfate molar ratio of 0.35 mol mol(−1), i.e., electron donor limitation, lactate oxidation was mainly carried out by incompletely oxidizing sulfate-reducing bacteria, which formed 80–85% of the total bacterial population. Desulfomicrobium- and Desulfovibrio-like species were the most abundant sulfate-reducing bacteria. Acetogens and methanogenic Archaea were mostly outcompeted, although less than 2% of an acetogenic population could still be observed at this limiting concentration of lactate. In the near absence of sulfate (i.e., at very high lactate/sulfate ratio), acetogens and methanogenic Archaea were the dominant microbial communities. Acetogenic bacteria represented by Dendrosporobacter quercicolus-like species formed more than 70% of the population, while methanogenic bacteria related to uncultured Archaea comprising about 10–15% of the microbial community. At an influent lactate to sulfate molar ratio of 2 mol mol(−1), i.e., under sulfate-limiting conditions, a different metabolic route was followed by the mixed anaerobic community. Apparently, lactate was fermented to acetate and propionate, while the majority of sulfidogenesis and methanogenesis were dependent on these fermentation products. This was consistent with the presence of significant levels (40–45% of total bacteria) of D. quercicolus-like heteroacetogens and a corresponding increase of propionate-oxidizing Desulfobulbus-like sulfate-reducing bacteria (20% of the total bacteria). Methanogenic Archaea accounted for 10% of the total microbial community.","Dar, Shabir A.; Kleerebezem, Robbert; Stams, Alfons J. M.; Kuenen, J.

The resistance of the treated specimens against Trametes versicolor and Coniophora puteana, determined as mass loss, increased with increasing WPG of DMDHEU. Metabolic activity of the fungi in the wood blocks was assessed as total esterase activity (TEA) based on the hydrolysis of fluorescein diacetate and as heat or energy production determined by isothermal micro-calorimetry. Both methods revealed that the fungal activity was related with the WPG and the mass loss caused by the fungi. Still, fungal activity was detected even in wood blocks of the highest WPG and showed that the treatment was not toxic to the fungi. Energy production showed a higher consistency with the mass loss after decay than TEA; higher mass loss was more stringently reflected by higher heat production rate. Heat production did not proceed linearly, possibly due to the inhibition of fungal activity by an excess of carbon dioxide.","Verma, Pradeep; Dyckmans, Jens; Militz, Holger; Mai, Carsten",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2469595/,354

Highly efficient production of microalgal biomass without the need for light is now feasible in inexpensive, well-defined mineral medium, typically supplemented with glucose. Cell densities of more than 100 g l(−1) cell dry weight have been achieved with Chlorella, Crypthecodinium and Galdieria species while controlling the addition of organic sources of carbon and energy in fedbatch mode. The ability of microalgae to adapt their metabolism to varying culture conditions provides opportunities to modify, control and thereby maximise the formation of targeted compounds with non-recombinant microalgae. This review outlines the critical aspects of cultivation technology and current best practices in the heterotrophic high-cell-density cultivation of microalgae. The primary topics include (1) the characteristics of microalgae that make them suitable for heterotrophic cultivation, (2) the appropriate chemical composition of mineral growth media, (3) the different strategies for fedbatch cultivations and (4) the principles behind the customisation of biomass composition. The review confirms that, although fundamental knowledge is now available, the development of efficient, economically feasible large-scale bioprocesses remains an obstacle to the commercialisation of this promising technology.","Bumbak, Fabian; Cook, Stella; Zachleder, Vilém; Hauser, Silas; Kovar, Karin",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3114082/,354
12221,Review of mass transfer aspects for biological gas treatment,2011-06-24,"Fixation ability of five common fixation solutions, including 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 10% formalin, 4% paraformaldehyde, methanol/acetone (1:1), and ethanol/acetic acid (3:1) were evaluated by using atomic force microscopy in the present study. Three model bacteria, i.e., Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, and Bacillus subtilis were applied to observe the above fixation methods for the morphology preservation of bacterial cells and surface ultrastructures. All the fixation methods could effectively preserve cell morphology. However, for preserving bacterial surface ultrastructures, the methods applying aldehyde fixations performed much better than those using alcohols, since the alcohols could detach the surface filaments (i.e., flagella and pili) significantly. Based on the quantitative and qualitative assessments, the 2.5% glutaraldehyde was proposed as a promising fixation solution both for observing morphology of both bacterial cell and surface ultrastructures, while the methonal/acetone mixture was the worst fixation solution which may obtain unreliable results.

The short-term precision for direct DXR has been reported to be highly satisfactory. However, long-term precision for this method has not been examined. Thus, the aim of this study was to examine the long-term in-vitro precision for the new direct digital version of DXR. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The in-vitro precision for direct DXR was tested with cadaver phantoms on four different X-ray systems at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and in one machine also at 12 months. At each time point, 31 measurements were performed. RESULTS: The in-vitro longitudinal precision for the four radiographic systems ranged from 0.22 to 0.43% expressed as coefficient of variation (CV%). The smallest detectable difference (SDD) ranged from 0.0034 to 0.0054 g/cm(2). CONCLUSIONS: The in vitro long-term precision for direct DXR was comparable to the previous reported short-term in-vitro precision for all tested X-ray systems. These data show that DXR is a stable method for detecting small changes in bone density during 6–12 months of follow-up.","Dhainaut, Alvilde; Hoff, Mari; Kälvesten, Johan; Lydersen, Stian; Forslind, Kristina; Haugeberg, Glenn",Skeletal Radiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3198192/,354

The populations established in each condition were assessed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene fragments. The fermentation pattern and the composition of the microbial population were also evaluated when operational variations were imposed (increase of substrate concentration or introduction of a second substrate). The experimental results demonstrated that at low and high pH values, a clearly different fermentation pattern was associated with the dominance of a specialised group of clostridiae. At intermediate pH values, the product spectrum was rather variable and seemed to be sensitive to variations in the microbial community. Different substrates resulted in the establishment of different microbial communities. When fed with a mixture of two substrates, mixotrophic microorganisms (capable of degrading both substrates) were found to overgrow the originally dominant specialists. Overall, the experiments have shown that some operational variables have a clear impact on the fermentation pattern and on the population established. However, a uniform relationship between the process characteristics (associated to a metabolic response) and the microbial population present is not always possible.

Integrative plasmids that are only replicated in E. coli could be mobilized to M. methylotrophus and contained mini-Mu unit with a short terminus of Mu DNA, Mu-attL/R. Mini-Mu unit was integrated in the M. methylotrophus genome via mobilization of the integrative plasmid to the cells carrying the helper in conditions of thermo-induced expression of MuA and MuB. In this system, mini-Mu unit was mainly integrated due to replicative transposition, and the integrated copy could be amplified in the M. methylotrophus chromosome in the presence of helper plasmid. A kan-gene flanked by FRT sites was inserted in one of the mini-Mu units, and it could be readily excised by yeast FLP recombinase that is encoded by the designed plasmid. The multiple Mu-driven gene insertion was carried out by integration of the Bacillus amyloliquefaciens α-amylase gene followed by curing the Km(R) marker before integration of the second mini-Mu unit with Pseudomonas putida xylE gene encoding catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (C23O).","Abalakina, Elena G.; Tokmakova, Irina L.; Gorshkova, Natalya V.; Gak, Evgueni R.; Akhverdyan, Valerii Z.; Mashko, Sergey V.; Yomantas, Yurgis A.

RESULTS: The new placement and removal procedures of the SGB were effective and safe in all the cases. Due to simplicity and shortened duration of the procedures, all the patients left the outpatient clinic in less than 1 h after the placement or removal of the SGB. For the 14 patients who had completed the 6-month treatment, the initial mean weight, mean body mass index (BMI), and mean excess of weight (EW) were, respectively, 100.7 kg, 35.7 kg/m(2), and 30.0 kg. After the 6-month treatment, these values decreased significantly: 89.4 kg, 31.8 kg/m(2), and 19.6 kg.

In the former a mixture of diluted Gadolinium and dyed polymer was injected. In the latter the dyed polymer was injected after arthrography wih diluted Gadolinium. Three-millimeter slices of these legs, obtained in a plane identical to that of the MR images, were plastinated according to the E12 technique of von Hagens. The plastination slices were subsequently compared with the MR images. RESULTS: The one-step procedure resulted in an inhomogeneous arthrogram. The two-step procedure resulted in a good correlation between the high-resolution MR images and plastination slices, as expressed by a good comparison of anatomic detail of the small syndesmotic recess.

However, recent studies have found that patients with pulmonary ground-glass opacity (GGO) have a better prognosis. Considering its low invasiveness, sublobar resection may be an appropriate treatment of choice. Low-dose computed tomography (CT) is recommended for the high-risk groups of lung cancer. Patients with nonsolid nodule are suggested to take annual low dose CT following-up. For part-solid or solid nodules, the solid component size less or more than 8 mm is the watershed of surgical treatment. Increasing tumor size is a hint of malignancy. Biopsy can be performed for clinically highly suspected malignant nodules. The endobronchial ultrasound biopsy, CT-guide biopsy, or surgical excision are the mainstream for the diagnosis of lung nodules. But for treatment, the sublobar resection is the mainstream of pulmonary GGO. A precise localization technique makes surgeons get enough resection margin and preserve more pulmonary function of the patients. The different localization technique is suitable for different kind nodular position. For patients with pure pulmonary GGO, annual low dose CT checkup is suitable. If the tumor size or solid part of the tumors increased gradually, adequate sublobar resection after tumor localization technique may provide good prognosis and preserve more pulmonary function of the patients.","Lin, Yi-Han; Hsu, Han-Shui",J Chin Med Assoc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7434019/,354

It is vital to assure a proper systematic patient condition evaluation, not only in the oldest (geriatric assessment) but in all adult patients. We have investigated the feasibility of a systematic evaluation of the general condition of all patients diagnosed with hematologic malignancies, and the degree of acceptance by the clinical team, in a prospective cohort of 182 consecutive adults, by using the ECOG performance status scale (ECOG, age 18 and over, 18+), Lee Index for Older Adults (LEE, 50+), Geriatric Assessment in Hematology (GAH, 65+), and the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA, 75+). Clinical team acceptance was analyzed with a visual analogue scale, and the objective feasibility was calculated as the proportion of patients that could be finally evaluated with each tool. Acceptance was high, but the objective feasibility was progressively lower as the complexity of the different tools increased (ECOG 100%, LEE 99.4%, GAH 93.2%, and CGA 67.9%). LEE and GAH categories showed a weak concordance (Cohen’s Kappa 0.24) that was slight between LEE and CGA (Kappa 0.18). Unexpectedly, we found no significant association between the GAH and CGA categories (p = 0.16).

In this study, we conducted in vivo and in vitro experiments to verify this proposal. SD rats were pretreated with CA (10 or 40 mg · kg(−1) · d(−1), ig) for 3 days, then subjected to 1 h mesenteric ischemia followed by 2 h reperfusion. CA pretreatment dose-dependently ameliorated morphological damage and reduced inflammation evidenced by decreased TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 levels and MPO activity in I/R-treated intestinal tissues. CA pretreatment also attenuated oxidative stress through restoring SOD, GSH, LDH, and MDA levels in I/R-treated intestinal tissues. Furthermore, CA pretreatment significantly reduced the expression of inflammation/apoptosis-related NF-κB p65, IKKβ, IK-α, and NF-κB p50, and downregulated apoptotic protein expression including p53, Bax, caspase-9 and caspase-3, and restoring Bcl-2, in I/R-treated intestinal tissues. We pretreated IEC-6 cells in vitro with CA for 24 h, followed by 4 h hypoxia and 3 h reoxygenation (H/R) incubation. Pretreatment with CA (3.125, 6.25, and 12.5 μmol · L(−1)) significantly reversed H/R-induced reduction of IEC-6 cell viability. CA pretreatment significantly suppressed oxidative stress, NF-κB activation and apoptosis in H/R-treated IEC-6 cells. Moreover, CA pretreatment significantly reversed mitochondrial dysfunction in H/R-treated IEC-6 cells. CA pretreatment inhibited the nuclear translocation of p53 and NF-κB p65 in H/R-treated IEC-6 cells. Double knockdown or overexpression of p53 and NF-κB p65 caused a synergistic reduction or elevation of p53 compared with knockdown or overexpression of p53 or NF-κB p65 alone. In H/R-treated IEC-6 cells with double knockdown or overexpression of NF-κB p65 and p53, CA pretreatment caused neither further decrease nor increase of NF-κB p65 or p53 expression, suggesting that CA-induced synergistic inhibition on both NF-κB and p53 played a key role in ameliorating intestinal I/R injuries. Finally, we used immunoprecipitation assay to demonstrate an interaction between p53 and NF-κB p65, showing the basis for CA-induced synergistic inhibition.

The effect of crystalloid composition on biomarkers of early acute kidney injury remains unknown. METHODS: From February 15 to July 15, 2016, we conducted an ancillary study to the Isotonic Solutions and Major Adverse Renal Events Trial (SMART) comparing the effect of balanced crystalloids versus saline on urinary levels of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) among 261 consecutively-enrolled critically ill adults admitted from the emergency department to the medical ICU. After informed consent, we collected urine 36 ± 12 h after hospital admission and measured NGAL and KIM-1 levels using commercially available ELISAs. Levels of NGAL and KIM-1 at 36 ± 12 h were compared between patients assigned to balanced crystalloids versus saline using a Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: The 131 patients (50.2%) assigned to the balanced crystalloid group and the 130 patients (49.8%) assigned to the saline group were similar at baseline. Urinary NGAL levels were significantly lower in the balanced crystalloid group (median, 39.4 ng/mg [IQR 9.9 to 133.2]) compared with the saline group (median, 64.4 ng/mg [IQR 27.6 to 339.9]) (P < 0.001). Urinary KIM-1 levels did not significantly differ between the balanced crystalloid group (median, 2.7 ng/mg [IQR 1.5 to 4.9]) and the saline group (median, 2.4 ng/mg [IQR 1.3 to 5.0]) (P = 0.36). CONCLUSIONS: In this ancillary analysis of a clinical trial comparing balanced crystalloids to saline among critically ill adults, balanced crystalloids were associated with lower urinary concentrations of NGAL and similar urinary concentrations of KIM-1, compared with saline. These results suggest only a modest reduction in early biomarkers of acute kidney injury with use of balanced crystalloids compared with saline.

15937,Leptospira interrogans serogroup Pomona strains isolated from river buffaloes,2021-03-05,"GPR15 is a chemoattractant receptor that facilitates colon homing of regulatory and effector CD4(+) T cells in health and colitis. The molecular mechanisms that control GPR15 expression are not fully known. Here we report the presence of two highly conserved aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) binding sequences in a 3′ enhancer of GPR15, leading us to investigate AHR function in regulating GPR15 expression. Using luciferase reporter assays, we show that AHR activation increased GPR15 expression and requires both the AHR binding sites. Consistent with a transcriptional regulatory role, treatment with AHR agonists induce GPR15 expression on human CD4(+) T cells. Using AHR-deficient mice, we demonstrate that the lack of AHR signaling drastically reduces GPR15 expression on effector/memory and Foxp3(+) CD4(+) T cells. In mixed bone marrow chimeras of AHR-deficient and wildtype cells, GPR15 expression was similarly diminished on AHR-deficient CD4(+) effector/memory and regulatory T cells in the colon and small intestine. Furthermore, administration of AHR agonists upregulated GPR15 expression on CD4(+) effector/memory T cells and increased their homing capability, especially to the colon. Collectively, our studies reveal a novel function of the AHR in regulation of GPR15 expression and increased colon trafficking of CD4(+) T cells expressing GPR15.","Swaminathan, Gayathri; Nguyen, Linh P.; Namkoong, Hong; Pan, Junliang; Haileselassie, Yeneneh; Patel, Akshar; Ji, Allison R.; Mikhail, David M.; Dinh, Theresa Thanh; Singh, Harpriya; Liao, Bryce; Vázquez-Montesino, Luis M.; Butcher, Eugene C.; Habtezion, Aida",Mucosal Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7934811/,354
16078,Dissecting Response to Cancer Immunotherapy by Applying Bayesian Network Analysis to Flow Cytometry Data,2021-02-26,"Dehumanization is a pernicious psychological process that often leads to extreme intergroup bias, hate speech, and violence aimed at targeted social groups. Despite these serious consequences and the wealth of available data, dehumanization has not yet been computationally studied on a large scale. Drawing upon social psychology research, we create a computational linguistic framework for analyzing dehumanizing language by identifying linguistic correlates of salient components of dehumanization. We then apply this framework to analyze discussions of LGBTQ people in the New York Times from 1986 to 2015. Overall, we find increasingly humanizing descriptions of LGBTQ people over time. However, we find that the label homosexual has emerged to be much more strongly associated with dehumanizing attitudes than other labels, such as gay. Our proposed techniques highlight processes of linguistic variation and change in discourses surrounding marginalized groups. Furthermore, the ability to analyze dehumanizing language at a large scale has implications for automatically detecting and understanding media bias as well as abusive language online.","Mendelsohn, Julia; Tsvetkov, Yulia; Jurafsky, Dan",Front Artif Intell,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7861242/,354

Many biological processes are carried out by proteins embedded in or associated with such membranes. Determination of membrane protein (MP) structures at atomic or near-atomic resolution plays a vital role in elucidating their structural and functional impact in biology. This endeavor has determined 1198 unique MP structures as of early 2021. The value of these structures is expanded greatly by deposition of their three-dimensional (3D) coordinates into the Protein Data Bank (PDB) after the first atomic MP structure was elucidated in 1985. Since then, free access to MP structures facilitates broader and deeper understanding of MPs, which provides crucial new insights into their biological functions. Here we highlight the structural and functional biology of representative MPs and landmarks in the evolution of new technologies, with insights into key developments influenced by the PDB in magnifying their impact.","Li, Fei; Egea, Pascal F.; Vecchio, Alex J.; Asial, Ignacio; Gupta, Meghna; Paulino, Joana; Bajaj, Ruchika; Dickinson, Miles Sasha; Ferguson-Miller, Shelagh; Monk, Brian C.; Stroud, Robert M.",J Biol Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8102919/,354

Whilst clinical protocols for the management of individual DRESS cases have been well established, determination of potential prevention of these cases by utilizing novel “avoidability” tools has remained unexplored. This retrospective study reviewed records of patients who presented to the emergency department of Weill Cornell Medicine-affiliated Hamad General Hospital, Doha Qatar with suspected DRESS syndrome. These cases were independently adjudicated (utilizing the RegiSCAR, and JSCAR tools) as DRESS-drug pairs by a team of two clinical pharmacists and two General Physicians. They were then rated for potential avoidability with the Liverpool adverse drug reactions avoidability tool (LAAT) by the same team of raters. A total of 16 patients satisfied RegiSCAR criteria for DRESS syndrome. The mean age of the study population was 41.5 years (SD ± 13.3). The study population was predominantly male (n = 12; [75%]). The median latent period from drug ingestion to clinical presentation was 14 days (interquartile range [IQR] 6.5, 29). The median RegiSCAR and J-SCAR scores were 6 (IQR 5, 6.8), 5 (IQR 4, 5.8) respectively. Utilizing the LAAT, about 60% of the DRESS syndrome-drug pairs were rated as “avoidable” (“probable” or “definite”). The overall Krippendorf’s alpha with the LAAT was 0.81 (SE 0.10, CI 0.59–1.00); with an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.90 (CI 0.77, 0.96.). In a randomly selected cohort of DRESS syndrome-drug pairs, a significant proportion was potentially avoidable (“possibly” and “definitely”) utilizing the LAAT. This will need validation by larger sample-sized prospective studies utilizing the updated LAAT proposed by this study.","Danjuma, Mohammed Ibn-Mas’ud; Naseralallah, Lina Mohammad Ahmad; AbouJabal, Bodoor; Mohamed, Mouhand Faisal; Abubeker, Ibrahim Y.; Jabbar, Layla Abdul; Elzouki, Abdelnaser",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8429441/,354

The etiology and pathophysiological mechanisms of inflammatory neuropathies are only partly known, but are considered autoimmune disorders in which an aberrant immune response, including cellular and humoral components, is directed towards components of the peripheral nerve causing demyelination and axonal damage. Therapy of these disorders includes broad-spectrum immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive treatments, such as intravenous immunoglobulin, corticosteroids, or plasma exchange. However, a significant proportion of patients do not respond to any of these therapies, and treatment selection is not optimized according to disease pathophysiology. Therefore, research on disease pathophysiology aiming to reveal clinically and functionally relevant disease mechanisms and the development of new treatment approaches are needed to optimize disease outcomes in CIDP and GBS. This topical review describes immunological progress that may help guide therapeutic strategies in the future in these two disorders.

By Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Energy-Dispersive X-ray Analysis (EDXA), these bacteria were certificated to be magnetotactic bacteria. The phylogenetic relationship between the isolated magnetic strains and some known magnetotactic bacteria was inferred by the construction of phylogenetic tree based on 16SrDNA sequences. This apparatus has been proven to have the advantages of being inexpensive, simple to assemble, easy to perform and highly efficient to isolate novel magnetotactic bacteria.

This analysis aimed to understand the impact of timing of diagnosis on hospital LOS. METHODS: A retrospective review of patient charts was conducted. Data for adults ≥18 years with confirmed RSV (Oct 2014–Oct 2016; USA) were collected. Each physician (n = 132) submitted up to 3 randomly selected patient cases via an online survey. RESULTS: This study comprised 379 patients, collected in 4 groups (Table). >80% of patients received an RT-PCR test; rapid antigen tests were uncommon (≤10%) with an RT-PCR test also performed in 45% of these. Early RSV diagnosis and less severe disease were associated with a shorter mean LOS (Figure 1and2). Patients diagnosed >24h post-admission had a longer mean [SD] LOS (9.8 [8.6] days; n = 29) than patients diagnosed <12h post-admission (6.2 [3.9] days; n = 67; P = 0.006), and patients diagnosed 12–24h post-admission (7.4 [4.2] days; n = 56; P = 0.038). LOS was higher (P = 0.005) in patients diagnosed in the intensive care unit (9.4 days) than the emergency room or hospital ward (both 6.8 days). CONCLUSION: RSV disease in adults was typically diagnosed by PCR. Delayed diagnosis and greater RSV disease severity are associated with longer LOS, but results need to be confirmed by prospective trials. Introduction of diagnostic testing protocols may lead to earlier identification of patients in need of supportive care and reduce mean LOS. DISCLOSURES: E.

27052,"Index to Volume 10, 2008",2008-11-19,"The development of a “cold-like illness” (CLI) usually requires infection with an upper respiratory virus such as rhinovirus, influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfuluenza virus, coronavirus or adenovirus, among others, and the development of sufficient signs, symptoms and pathophysiologies to qualify as being ill based on personal and cultural definitions. A viral upper respiratory tract infection (vURTI) in the absence of overt illness (subclinical vURTI) will not be made manifest to the individual or to observers and, therefore, will not be diagnosed as a CLI. The degree of illness occurring during a vURTI is directly related to the extent of provoked inflammation, which in turn depends on the engagement of antiviral defense systems. Thus, risk factors for CLI can modulate either the vURTI risk by affecting virus exposure and/or susceptibility to infection, or the CLI risk given a vURTI by affecting immunocompetence, the provoked inflammation and/or the interpretation of ilness as a CLI. In this chapter, we review published studies for evidence of CLI risk-modulating factors and report that climate, crowding and perhaps female gender can affect the probability of exposure to vURTI viruses, that extant immunological factors and age can affect the probability of virus infection given exposure, that stress levels (moderated by social environment), health practices (exercise, tobacco and alcohol consumption, sleep efficiency) and genetics contribute to CLI risk most probably by modulating the immune-inflammatory response to infection, and that other factors such as pollution, home environment and certain personality traits affect CLI risk by biasing illness interpretation for a given set of symptoms and signs.","Doyle, William J.; Cohen, Sheldon",Common Cold,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7124141/,354

27365,Cumulative subject index volumes 24–25,2004-04-11,"The common cold is an acute illness of the upper respiratory tract caused by a virus acquired from another person. Some viruses that produce colds are capable of infecting an individual repeatedly (eg, respiratory syncytial virus); others, with many serotypes (eg, rhinovirus), infect only once. The sustained epidemic of colds that occurs annually during September through April is explained by successive waves of different viruses moving through a community. The peak incidence of colds occurs in preschool children, who typically sustain at least one illness per month during the epidemic period. Clinical manifestations of colds are largely subjective in adults. Colds in preschoolers differ from those in adults as follows: (1) fever is common in children during the first 3 days; (2) colored nasal secretions may be the only indication of nasal involvement in children; and (3) colds in children last 10 to 14 days, as compared with a duration of less than a week in adults. The paranasal sinuses and the middle ear cavities are commonly involved during viral colds in adults (and presumably in children) in the absence of bacterial superinfection. Cold symptoms are due to the host's response to the virus rather than to destruction of the nasal mucosa. Viral infection of a very limited portion of the nasal epithelium results in an influx of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, cytokine release, and a vascular leak. Colds are self-limited illnesses. Therefore, in the absence of adequate blinding of controls, ineffective treatments erroneously may be considered efficacious. None of the medicines used for symptom relief in colds is curative.","Hendley, J. Owen",Semin Pediatr Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7129474/,354

In the United States, more than one million cases of pneumonias afflict children under the age of 5 years, costing hundreds of millions of dollars annually. The majority of these infections are caused by a handful of common viruses. Knowledge of the epidemiology of these viruses combined with new rapid diagnostic techniques will provide faster and more, reliable diagnoses in the future. Although the basic clinical epidemiology of these viruses has been carefully investigated over the last 30 years, new molecular techniques are greatly expanding our understanding of these agents and the diseases they cause. Antigenic and genetic variations are being discovered in many viruses previously thought to be homogeneous. The exact roles and the biological significance of these variations are just beginning to be explored, but already evidence of differences in pathogenicity and immunogenicity has been found in many of these substrains. All of this information clearly will impact the development of future vaccines and antiviral drugs. Effective drugs exist for prophylaxis against influenza A and respiratory syncytial virus, and specific therapy exists for influenza A. Ribarivin is approved for use in respiratory synctial virus infections, and it alone or in combination with other agents (eg, IGIV) may be effective in immunocompromised patients, either in preventing the development of pneumonia or in decreasing morbidity and mortality.

At the farm level, data were stratified by season, with two six-month seasons (winter and summer) per year. The odds of farms with particular management strategies having above-median morbidity were calculated. At the individual calf level, the odds of a calf being treated, controlling for farm of origin and month of birth, were calculated for different management practices. Larger farms had significantly greater odds of experiencing mortality than smaller farms in both winter and summer. Farms which had policies of attending calvings and ensuring that calves received their first colostrum had significantly lower odds of experiencing winter mortality than farms which did not have these policies. Farms which housed calves in hutches had significantly lower odds, and those which housed calves in group pens had significantly higher odds, of experiencing summer mortality, than farms which used individual indoor calf-pens. A policy of teat removal between four weeks of age and weaning was associated with increased odds of summer mortality. At the individual calf level, calving ease, sire, navel treatment, assistance at first colostrum feeding, administration of vitamins A, D and E and anti-scour vaccines to the pregnant dam, and place of calving, were all associated with significantly altered odds of dying.

Jour. Bot. 49(8): 855–865. Illus. 1962.—Chromosome numbers for 39 taxa of Hedyotis separable into the subgenera Edrisia (Raf.) Lewis and Oldenlandia (L.) T. & G. are reported. The occurrence of basic numbers of x = 6, 7, 8, 9(10), 11, and 13, including infraspecific aneuploidy in H. nigricans (Lam.) Fosb., illustrates the importance of aneuploidy in the speciation of Hedyotis in contrast to most rubiaceous genera. In the North American subg. Edrisia, 25 species are ranked according to primitive and advanced expressions for 13 characters. It is postulated on the basis of these, ecologic, geographic, and chromosomal data that the x = 11 group gave rise to the x = 13 line by the gain of chromosomes and to the x = (10)9, 8, and 7 groups by reduction. Those species with a basic number of 6 are thought to have an Asian origin. Although aneuploidy has been dominant in the evolution of subg. Edrisia, only 12% of the species are polyploids. The development of polyploid races in 3 species, H. caerulea (L.) Hook., H. polypremoides (Gray) Shinners, and H. purpurea (L.) T. & G., however, suggests a greater role of polyploidy in the current evolution of Hedyotis.","Lewis, Walter H.",Am J Bot,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7138091/,354

The reproduction numbers for virus infection, antibody immune response, CTL immune response, CTL immune competition and antibody immune competition, respectively, are calculated. By using the Lyapunov functionals and linearization methods, the threshold conditions on the global stability of the equilibria for infection-free, immune-free, antibody response, CTL response and antibody and CTL responses, respectively, are established if the space is assumed as homogeneous. When the space is inhomogeneous, the effects of diffusion, intracellular delay and production delay are obtained by the numerical simulations.","Miao, Hui; Teng, Zhidong; Abdurahman, Xamxinur; Li, Zhiming",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149116/,354

Clinical food intolerance has many causes and many manifestations, including psychological aversion to the sight, smell, or taste of food as well as psychological intolerance to one or more of the many constituents of food. Dietary protein intolerance is the clinical syndrome resulting from the sensitization of an individual to one or more proteins that have been absorbed via a permeable mucosa in the small intestine. Intolerance to various food proteins, especially to cows' milk, has been recognized in children for many years. Such food intolerance may be the result of a variety of causes—for example, a congenital digestive enzyme defect such as sucrase–isomaltase deficiency or an acquired lactase deficiency secondary to small-intestinal mucosal damage, which in turn can be the result of a food allergy. The incidence of gastrointestinal food allergy diseases is greatest in the first few months and years of an infant's life and decreases with age. The acute syndrome is usually characterized by the sudden onset of vomiting, after cows' milk ingestion, occasionally followed by pallor and a shock-like state; however, acute anaphylaxis is rare. Acute abdominal pain seems to be a particular feature of fish hypersensitivity, while peanuts often produce immediate reactions in the oral mucosa as well as abdominal pain.","Walker-Smith, John",Diseases of the Small Intestine in Childhood,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7151781/,354

30450,THE ANTHELMINTIC ACTIVITY OF THIABENDAZOLE (M.K.360),2008-03-10,"This chapter discusses effects of intrinsic membrane proteins on lipid bilayers and model transmembrane α helices. Incorporation of a protein into a lipid bilayer has significant effects on the properties of the bilayer. The rough surface presented by a protein to the surrounding lipid bilayer tends to produce poor packing unless the lipid fatty acyl chains distort to match the surface of the protein. In a liquid crystalline bilayer the lipid fatty acyl chains are disordered, because the chains undergo extensive wobbling fluctuations. The presence of a rigid protein surface reduces the extent of these motional fluctuations. However, the chains tilt and become conformationally disordered to maximize contact with the rough surface of the protein. The net result is that the presence of a protein leads to decreased order for the chains, with a wide range of chain orientations relative to the bilayer normal, but with reduced extent and rate of motion. Because of the reduced motion, lipids adjacent to membrane proteins are often referred to as being motionally restricted. It is clear that the reasons for the disorder of the bulk lipids and the disorder of the lipids adjacent to the protein are different; for the bulk phospholipids, the disorder is dynamic, whereas, for the boundary lipids the disorder is static.","Mall, Sanjay; Malcolm East, J.; Lee, Anthony G.",Curr Top Membr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7157917/,354

30874,SMALL ANIMAL LITERATURE INDEX,2008-04-10,"AIM: Protected areas are key conservation tools intended to increase biodiversity and reduce extinction risks of species and populations. However, the degree to which protected areas achieve their conservation goals is generally unknown for many protected areas worldwide. We assess the effect of protected areas on the abundance of 196 common, resident bird species. If protected areas were beneficial to avian biodiversity, we expect landscapes with a higher proportion of protected areas will have higher densities of species compared to landscapes with no protection. LOCATION: Greater Gauteng region, South Africa. METHODS: We analysed bird survey data collected over regular grid cells across the study area. We estimated bird abundance in relation to the proportion of a grid cell that was protected with the Royle–Nichols model and fitted the model once for each of the species. We examined variation in estimated abundance as a function of avian guild (defined by the type of food a species preferentially ate and its foraging mode) with a regression tree analysis. RESULTS: Abundance was significantly positively related to the proportion of protected areas in grid cells for 26% of the species, significantly negatively related in 15%, and not significantly related in 59% species. We found three distinct guild groups which differed in their average abundance, after accounting for associated variance. Group 1 consisted of guilds frugivores, ground‐feeders, hawkers, predators, and vegivores and average abundance was strongly positively related to the proportion of protected areas. Group 2 included granivores, and average abundance was strongly negatively related to proportion of protected areas. Group 3 included gleaners only, and average abundance was not related to proportion of protected areas. MAIN CONCLUSION: We conclude that the network of protected areas within the greater Gauteng region sustained relatively higher abundances of common birds and thus perform an important conservation role.","Duckworth, Gregory D.; Altwegg, Res",Divers Distrib,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7163781/,354
30892,SMALL ANIMAL LITERATURE INDEX,2008-04-10,"Larval and early juvenile fishes were sampled from the eastern Bering Sea (EBS) shelf from 2001 to 2005, and in 2007. Data from these collections were used to examine spatial and temporal patterns in species assemblage structure and abundance. The years 2001–2005 were unusual because the EBS water temperature was ‘warm’ compared with the long‐term mean temperature. In contrast, 2007 was a ‘cold’ year. The abundance of the five most numerous taxa at 12 stations common to all years sampled (1996–2005, 2007) were significantly different among years. Larval and early juvenile stage Theragra chalcogramma (walleye pollock), a commercially important gadid, were by far the most abundant fish in all years. Bottom depth alone best explained assemblage structure in most years, but in others, bottom depth and water column temperature combined and percent sea‐ice coverage were most important. Abundance of T. chalcogramma larvae increases with water column temperature until 5°C and then becomes level. Higher abundances of Gadus macrocephalus (Pacific cod) larvae occur in years with the greatest percent sea‐ice cover as indicated by GAM analysis. Larvae of Lepidopsetta polyxystra (northern rock sole) increase in abundance with increasing maximum wind speed, but decrease at a later date during the last winter storm. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that oceanographic conditions, specifically water temperature and sea‐ice coverage, affect the spatial and temporal pattern of larval abundances. In general, ichthyoplankton species assemblages can be important early indicators of environmental change in the Bering Sea and potentially other subarctic seas as well.","Busby, M.

This first crystal structure of a 2′‐5′‐oligoadenylate synthetase reveals a structural conservation with the 3′‐specific poly(A) polymerase that, coupled with structure‐guided mutagenesis, supports a conserved catalytic mechanism for the 2′‐ and 3′‐specific nucleotidyl transferases. Comparison with structures of other superfamily members indicates that the donor substrates are bound by conserved active site features while the acceptor substrates are oriented by nonconserved regions. The 2′‐5′‐oligoadenylate synthetases are activated by viral double‐stranded RNA in infected cells and initiate a cellular response by synthesizing 2′‐5′‐oligoadenylates, that in turn activate RNase L. This crystal structure suggests that activation involves a domain–domain shift and identifies a putative dsRNA activation site that is probed by mutagenesis. We demonstrated that this site is required both for the binding of dsRNA and for the subsequent activation of OAS. This RNA‐binding site is different from known RNA‐binding site; rather than forming a defined three‐dimensional domain, it is located at the interface of the two major domains in OAS. This novel architecture ensures that the dsRNA helix can make simultaneously contact with both domains of OAS and ensure the subsequent structural rearrangement leading to the activation of OAS. Our work provides structural insight into cellular recognition of double‐stranded RNA of viral origin and identifies a novel RNA‐binding motif.","Hartmann, R.; Justesen, J.; Sarkar, S.; Sen, G.; Yee, V.",Scand J Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7169539/,354

However, a direct relationship between total calcium intake and CVD has not been well established and remains controversial. Mendelian randomization (MR) studies have been performed to evaluate the causal association between serum calcium levels and CAD risk and found that increased serum calcium levels could increase the risk of CAD. However, MR analysis found no significant association between genetically higher serum calcium levels and IS as well as its subtypes. Hence, three MR studies reported inconsistent effects of serum calcium levels on CAD and IS. Here, we performed an updated MR study to investigate the association of serum calcium levels with the risk of IS using large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) datasets. We selected 14 independent genetic variants as the potential instrumental variables from a large-scale serum calcium GWAS dataset and extracted summary statistics corresponding to the 14 serum calcium genetic variants from the MEGASTROKE Consortium IS GWAS dataset. Interestingly, we found a significant association between serum calcium levels and IS risk using the robust inverse-variance weighted (IVW) and penalized robust IVW methods, with β = 0.243 and P = 0.002. Importantly, the MR results from the robust MR-Egger and penalized robust MR-Egger methods further supported the causal association between serum calcium levels and IS risk, with β = 0.256 and P = 0.005. Meanwhile, the estimates from other MR methods are also consistent with the above findings.","Meng, Qiang; Huang, Lu; Tao, Kai; Liu, Yong; Jing, Jiangpeng; Wang, Wen; Qin, Huaizhou; Feng, Dayun; Cai, Qing",Front Cell Dev Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7686510/,354

METHODS: A cross-sectional, online survey was distributed to MSs and foreign medical graduates (FMGs) residing in the United States who are considering or pursuing careers in neurosurgery. Descriptive statistics comparing MS years were performed. RESULTS: A total of 379 respondents from 67 medical schools completed the survey. Across all participants, 92% (n = 347) have stopped in-person didactic education, and 43% (n = 161) have experienced basic science and 44% (n = 167) clinical research delays. Sixty percent (n = 227) cite a negative impact on academic productivity. Among first year medical students (MS1s), 18% (n = 17) are less likely to pursue a career in neurosurgery. Over half of MS2s and MS3s are likely to delay taking the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Steps I and II. Among MS3s, 77% (n = 91) report indefinite postponement of sub-internships, and 43% (n = 53) are unsatisfied with communication from external programs. Many MS4s (50%, n = 17) are graduating early to participate in COVID-19-related patient care. The top student-requested support activities included access to student-focused educational webinars and studentfocused sessions at upcoming neurosurgical conferences. CONCLUSION: Medical students pursuing careers in neurosurgery have unique academic, career, and personal challenges secondary to the pandemic.

PURPOSE Our aim was to analyze the outcomes after flow diversion among nonsaccular unruptured lesions. DATA SOURCES A systematic search of 3 data bases (2005-2019) was performed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. STUDY SELECTION We included studies reporting flow diversion for nonsaccular unruptured aneurysms of the posterior and distal anterior circulations. Anterior circulation lesions were included if located distal to the petrocavernous and supraclinoid ICA (MCA, A1, anterior communicating artery, A2). Giant dolichoectatic holobasilar lesions were excluded because of their poor treatment outcomes. DATA ANALYSIS Aneurysm occlusion and complication rates were calculated (random effects meta-analysis). DATA SYNTHESIS We included 15 studies (213 aneurysms). The long-term adequate occlusion rate was 85.3% (137/168; 95% CI, 78.2%-92.4%; I2 = 42.3%). Treatment-related complications were 17.4% (41/213; 95% CI, 12.45%-22.4%; I2 = 0%). Overall, 15% (37/213; 95% CI, 10%-20%; I2 = 0%) were ischemic events. Procedure-related morbidity was 8% (20/213; 95% CI, 5%-12%; I2 = 0%). Fusiform or dissecting types had comparable adequate occlusion (116/146 = 83%; 95% CI, 74%-92%; I2 = 48% versus 33/36 = 89%; 95% CI, 80%-98%; I2 = 0%; P = .31) and complication rates (35/162 = 17%; 95% CI, 10%-25%; I2 = 24% versus 11/51 = 19%; 95% CI, 10%-31%; I2 = 0%; P = .72). Aneurysm size (>10 versus ≤10 mm) was independently associated with a higher rate of complications (OR = 6.6; 95% CI, 1.3-15; P = .02). The rate of ischemic events after discontinuation of the antiplatelet therapy was 5% (5/93; 95% CI, 2%-9%; I2 = 0%). LIMITATIONS Small and retrospective studies were available for this meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS Unruptured nonsaccular aneurysms located in the posterior and distal anterior circulations can be effectively treated with flow diversion. Nevertheless, treatment-related complications are not negligible, with about 15% ischemic events and 8% morbidity. Larger size (>10 mm) significantly increases the risk of procedure-related adverse events.","Cagnazzo, F; Lefevre, P-H; Derraz, I; Dargazanli, C; Gascou, G; di Carlo, D T; Perrini, P; Ahmed, R; Hak, J F; Riquelme, C; Bonafe, A; Costalat, V",AJNR.

Methods In this prospective randomized study, 60 patients scheduled for elective surgery under general anesthesia lasting less than 120 min were divided into two groups: the 10-min pre-warming group (n = 30) and the control group (n = 30). Patients in the 10-min pre-warming group were pre-warmed for 10 min in the pre-anesthetic area using a forced-air warmer set at 47ºC. Intraoperatively, we warmed all patients with a forced-air warmer. Body temperature was measured using a tympanic membrane thermometer pre- or postoperatively and a nasopharyngeal temperature probe intraoperatively. Patients were evaluated on the shivering and thermal comfort scale in the pre-anesthetic area and post-anesthesia care unit. Results The incidences of intraoperative hypothermia and postoperative hypothermia were similar in both groups (10.7% vs. 28.6%, P = 0.177; 10.7% vs. 10.7%, P = 1.000 respectively). Body temperature was higher in the 10-min pre-warming group (P = 0.003). Thermal comfort during the pre-warming period was higher in the 10-min pre-warming group (P < 0.001). However, postoperative thermal comfort and shivering grades of both groups were similar. Conclusions Ten minutes of pre-warming has no additional effect on the prevention of inadvertent perioperative hypothermia in intraoperative warming patients.","Yoo, Jae Hwa; Ok, Si Young; Kim, Sang Ho; Chung, Ji Won; Park, Sun Young; Kim, Mun Gyu; Cho, Ho Bum; You, Gyu Wan",Anesthesia and pain medicine,https://doi.org/10.17085/apm.20027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33329836/,354

The spike protein of the virus and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) lead to the presence of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in the cells and, subsequently,decreased ACE2 expression. The therapeutic possibilities of ACE2 antibody, ACE2-derived peptides, and small molecule blockers of ACE2 include a receptor-binding domain blocking approach. Hence,future studies of ACE2 may be very helpful in discovering a therapy for SARS-CoV-2.

60613,Toxicogenomic Analysis.,2021,"BACKGROUND Little is known about the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission in educational settings. Public Health England initiated a study, COVID-19 Surveillance in School KIDs (sKIDs), in primary schools when they partially reopened from June 1, 2020, after the first national lockdown in England to estimate the incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, seroprevalence, and seroconversion in staff and students. METHODS sKIDs, an active, prospective, surveillance study, included two groups: the weekly swabbing group and the blood sampling group. The swabbing group underwent weekly nasal swabs for at least 4 weeks after partial school reopening during the summer half-term (June to mid-July, 2020). The blood sampling group additionally underwent blood sampling for serum SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to measure previous infection at the beginning (June 1-19, 2020) and end (July 3-23, 2020) of the summer half-term, and, after full reopening in September, 2020, and at the end of the autumn term (Nov 23-Dec 18, 2020). We tested for predictors of SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity using logistic regression. We calculated antibody seroconversion rates for participants who were seronegative in the first round and were tested in at least two rounds. FINDINGS During the summer half-term, 11 966 participants (6727 students, 4628 staff, and 611 with unknown staff or student status) in 131 schools had 40 501 swabs taken. Weekly SARS-CoV-2 infection rates were 4·1 (one of 24 463; 95% CI 0·1-21·8) per 100 000 students and 12·5 (two of 16 038; 1·5-45·0) per 100 000 staff. At recruitment, in 45 schools, 91 (11·2%; 95% CI 7·9-15·1) of 816 students and 209 (15·1%; 11·9-18·9) of 1381 staff members were positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, similar to local community seroprevalence. Seropositivity was not associated with school attendance during lockdown (p=0·13 for students and p=0·20 for staff) or staff contact with students (p=0·37). At the end of the summer half-term, 603 (73·9%) of 816 students and 1015 (73·5%) of 1381 staff members were still participating in the surveillance, and five (four students, one staff member) seroconverted.

For the first time, protein A conjugated with chitosan-coated iron oxide nanoparticles was prepared for pathogen separation at low concentrations from liquid samples. Vibrio cholerae O1 (VO1) bacteria were used for testing the effectiveness of this conjugate. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to confirm the presence of captured VO1. The results showed that, after binding with a specific antibody, the conjugate allows separation of VO1 bacteria from water samples at a concentration as low as 10 cfu mL(-1). Moreover, the conjugate can be used in parallel with conventional or modern diagnostic tests for quick and accurate detection of pathogens.","Huy, Tran Quang; Van Chung, Pham; Thuy, Nguyen Thanh; Blanco-Andujar, Cristina; Thanh, Nguyen Th Kim",Faraday discussions,https://doi.org/10.1039/c4fd00152d; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25421572/,354
61388,Evolution and Reversible Polarity of Multilayering at the Ionic Liquid/Water Interface.,2020-06-29,"Quinacridone and its substituted analogs are pigments widely used in art and industry. The temperature dependence of the crystal structures of two quinacridone polymorphs (β and γ), along with the common variant 2,9-dimethylquinacridone, were investigated using powder X-ray diffraction and terahertz spectroscopy. These were then compared with solid-state density functional theory simulations of both structures and vibrations. X-ray patterns were collected at eight temperatures in the range 13-298 K and terahertz spectra at fifteen temperatures in the range 20-300 K. Simulations were at absolute zero and at appropriate expansions to model room temperature. It was found that some of the powder X-ray diffraction features in only β-quinacridone (15.7°, 19.7° and 31.2° at 13 K) underwent anomalous shifting with temperature change. We attribute this to the unique coplanar hydrogen bonding pattern of β-quinacridone compared to the other solids, with the unusual diffraction peaks originating from crystallographic planes perpendicular to the a axis intermolecular hydrogen bonds. This observation coincides with a contraction of the a axis with heating and results from its relatively weak N-HO hydrogen bonds and significant C-HH-C repulsions. Associated with this anomalous contraction, for β-quinacridone only spectral peaks are seen to increase in energy with temperature.","Squires, A D; Zaczek, Adam J; Lewis, R A; Korter, Timothy M",Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0cp03150j; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830208/,354

As treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer improves, the incidence of men with intracranial metastasis from prostate cancer is increasing. Radiation therapy for treatment of intracranial metastasis from prostate cancer is systematically reviewed. A comprehensive review examining peer-reviewed, English language articles from 1990 to 2015 was performed on multiple databases, yielding 1274 articles. These articles were reviewed and selected for studies that met the following inclusion criteria: (1) patients with intracranial metastases from prostate cancer; (2) patients underwent radiation therapy as primary or adjuvant therapy; (3) the sample size of patients was larger than 2. All studies that met inclusion criteria utilized whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) in at least one patient. Other treatment regimens included stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), surgical resection followed by WBRT, as well as concurrent cabazitaxel and WBRT. The range of average time from initial diagnosis of prostate cancer to diagnosis of brain metastasis was 29-45 months. The range of reported median survival time after WBRT was 4-9 months, whereas median survivals after SRS ranged from 9 to 13 months. Intracranial metastases from prostate cancer occur late in the disease process, and are increasing as novel therapies for metastatic disease prolong survival. The reviewed literature suggests that outcomes of patients with prostate cancer intracranial metastases appear similar to those of intracranial metastases from other histologies. Prospective examinations of systemic therapies that cross the blood-brain barrier in conjunction with targeted radiotherapy appear warranted for this increasingly common clinical problem.","Sita, Timothy L; Petras, Katarina G; Wafford, Q Eileen; Berendsen, Mark A; Kruser, Tim J",Journal of neuro-oncology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11060-017-2460-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28547593/,354

Under these circumstances, immunochromatography may serve as an alternative method to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies that can demonstrate a history of infection. In patients with severe COVID-19 infection, 14 of 19 serum samples were shown to be positive, whereas 6 of 10 samples from patients with asymptomatic or mild cases were negative for IgG antibodies. Two patients with immune thrombocytopenia, who were treated with prednisolone, experienced aggressive behavior of COVID-19-related respiratory failure and eventually died. Patients who were before an achievement of remission and those who received steroid-based chemotherapy possessed a higher risk of death, and more deaths were observed in patients with lymphoid malignancies including lymphoma and myeloma compared with those with myeloid malignancies.

This study investigates the effects of cycling training on neuromuscular fatigue and its peripheral contribution measured during and immediately after cycling exercise. METHODS Fourteen healthy men performed a fatigue test before a 9-week cycling program (PRE) and two tests after training: at the same absolute power output as PRE (POSTABS) and based on the post-training maximal aerobic power (POSTREL). Throughout the tests and at exhaustion (EXH), maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) and peripheral fatigue were assessed in the quadriceps muscle by electrical nerve stimulation [single twitch (Pt); high-frequency doublet (Db100) and low-to-high-frequency ratio (Db10:100)]. RESULTS Time to EXH was longer in POSTABS than PRE (34 ± 5 vs. 27 ± 4 min, P < 0.001), and POSTREL tended to be longer than PRE (30 ± 6 min, P = 0.053). MVC and peripheral fatigue were overall less depressed in POSTABS than PRE at isotime. At EXH, MVC and Db10:100 were similarly reduced in all sessions (-37 to - 42% and - 30 to - 37%, respectively). Db100 tended to be less depressed in POSTABS than PRE (-40 ± 9 vs. - 48 ± 16%, P = 0.050) and in POSTREL than PRE (-39 ± 9%, P = 0.071). Pt decreased similarly in POSTABS and PRE (-52 ± 16 vs. - 54 ± 16%), but POSTREL tended to be less depressed than PRE (-48 ± 14%, P = 0.075). CONCLUSIONS This study confirms fatigue attenuation at isotime after training. Yet lower or similar fatigue at EXH indicates that, unlike previously suggested, fatigue tolerance may not be upregulated after 9 weeks of cycling training.","Mira, J; Aboodarda, S J; Floreani, M; Jaswal, R; Moon, S J; Amery, K; Rupp, T; Millet, Guillaume Y",European journal of applied physiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00421-018-3950-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30121882/,354

64299,A tailored approach to overcoming challenges of a bovine aortic arch during left internal carotid artery stenting.,2012,"Inflammation can cause a series of inflammatory lung disease, which seriously endangers human health. Pulmonary fibrosis is a kind of inflammatory disease with end-stage lung pathological changes. It has complicated and unknown pathogenesis and is still lack of effective therapeutic drugs. LPS-induced inflammation is a common feature of many infectious inflammations such as pneumonia, bacteremia, glomerulonephritis, etc. Evodiamine, one of the main components of Evodia rutaecarpa, is an alkaloid with excellent antiinflammatory effects. In this study, we evaluated the protective capacities of evodiamine on LPS-induced inflammatory damages in vitro and in vivo. MTT method, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, and other methods were used for in vitro study to determine the protective capacities of evodiamine. The results suggest that evodiamine can protect murine macrophages from the LPS-nigericin-induced damages by (a) inhibiting cellular apoptosis, (b) inhibiting inflammatory cytokines releasing, and (c) activating the apelin pathway. We also used the exogenous apelin-13 peptide co-cultured with LPS-nigericin in RAW264.7 cells and found that apelin-13 contributes to protecting the effects of evodiamine. In vivo, the ELISA method and immunohistochemistry were used to examine inflammatory cytokines, apelin, and histological changes. BALB/c mice were exposed to LPS and subsequent administration of evodiamine （p.o.）for some time, the results of the alveolar lavage fluid and the tissue slices showed that evodiamine treatment alleviated the pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis, stimulated apelin expression and inhibited the inflammatory cytokines. These results provide a basis for the protective effect and mechanism of evodiamine in LPS-induced inflammation and suggest that it might be potential therapeutics in human pulmonary infections.","Ye, Cui; Zhang, Nan; Zhao, Qian; Xie, Xin; Li, Xiang; Zhu, Hong-Ping; Peng, Cheng; Huang, Wei; Han, Bo",Phytotherapy research : PTR,https://doi.org/10.1002/ptr.7062; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33657655/,354

For the last two decades, HASTY (HST), the ortholog of human Exportin-5, has been considered as a candidate protein that exports plant miRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Here, we report HST functions in the miRNA pathway independent of its cargo-exporting activity in Arabidopsis. We found that Arabidopsis mutants with impaired HST shuttling present normal subcellular distribution of miRNAs. Interestingly, protein-protein interaction and microscopy assays showed that HST directly interacts with the microprocessor core component DCL1 through its N-terminal domain. Moreover, mass-spectrometry analysis revealed that HST also interacts, independently of its N-terminal domain, with the mediator complex subunit MED37. Further experiments showed that HST could act as a scaffold to facilitate the recruitment of DCL1 to genomic MIRNA loci by stabilizing the DCL1-MED37 complex, which in turn promotes the transcription and proper processing of pri-miRNAs. In summary, our results suggest that HST is likely associated with the formation of the miRNA biogenesis complex at MIRNA genes, promoting the transcription and processing of pri-miRNAs, rather than with the direct export of processed miRNAs from the nucleus.","Cambiagno, Damian A; Giudicatti, Axel J; Arce, Agustin L; Gagliardi, Delfina; Li, Lei; Yuan, Wei; Lundberg, Derek S; Weigel, Detlef; Manavella, Pablo A",Molecular plant,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molp.2020.12.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385584/,354

The COVID-19 pandemic has distorted many informal caregivers' roles, which require serious adjustment for reducing caregiving stress and burden. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has created challenging situations in caregiving spaces, which have the tendency to cause informal caregivers to abuse older adults. However, research on elder abuse and mistreatment, up to this point, remains underexplored in Africa. We, therefore, call for a deeper research and interrogation on the pathways and dynamics of violence and abuse against older adults in Africa. We also raise awareness of increased risks of domestic elder abuse and neglect during COVID-19 to stimulate the interest of social welfare institutions in understanding this phenomenon and its prevalence in Africa. We argue that the COVID-19 pandemic should serve as an avenue for governments, social welfare institutions, public health authorities, civil society and traditional leaders in African countries to develop a comprehensive programme and create public awareness to protect older adults against abuse, violence and neglect. The practical ways of minimising the effect of COVID-19 on domestic elder abuse in African settings are further discussed.","Arthur-Holmes, Francis; Gyasi, Razak M",Global public health,https://doi.org/10.1080/17441692.2021.1938171; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34115568/,354

Evaluating real-life clinical outcomes in atrial fibrillation patients receiving the WATCHMAN left atrial appendage closure technology was designed to collect prospective multicenter outcomes of thromboembolic events, bleeding, and mortality for patients implanted with a WATCHMAN in routine daily practice. METHODS One thousand twenty patients with a WATCHMAN implant procedure were prospectively followed in 47 centers. Left atrial appendage occlusion indication was based on the European Society of Cardiology guidelines. Follow-up and imaging were performed per local practice up to a median follow-up of 2 years. RESULTS Included population was old (age 73.4±8.9 years), at high risk for stroke (311 prior ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack and 153 prior hemorrhagic stroke) and bleeding (318 prior major bleeding), with CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥5 in 49%, hypertension, abnormal renal/liver function, stroke, bleeding history or predisposition, Labile international normalized ratio, elderly, drugs/alcohol concomitantly ≥3 in 40% and oral anticoagulation contraindication in 72%. During follow-up, 161 patients (16.4%) died, 22 strokes were observed (1.3/100 patient-years, 83% reduction versus historic data), and 47 major nonprocedural bleeding events (2.7/100 patient-years, 46% reduction versus historic data). Stroke and bleeding rates were consistently lower than historic data in those with prior ischemic (-76% and -41%) or hemorrhagic (-81% and 67%) stroke and prior bleeding (-85% and -30%). Lowest bleeding rates were seen in patients with early discontinuation of dual antiplatelet therapy. Patients with early discontinuation of antithrombotic therapy showed lower bleeding rates, while they were highest for those with prior bleeding. Device thrombus was observed in 34 patients (4.1%) and was not correlated to drug regimen during follow-up ( P=0.28). CONCLUSIONS During the complete 2-year follow-up of Evaluating Real-Life Clinical Outcomes in Atrial Fibrillation Patients Receiving the WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure Technology, patients with a WATCHMAN left atrial appendage occlusion device had consistently low rates of stroke and nonprocedural bleeding, although most were contraindicated to oral anticoagulation and used only single antiplatelet therapy or nothing.

67255,Uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic bronchoplastic and carinal sleeve procedures.,2016,"BACKGROUND There are limited data quantifying national trends, post-operative readmissions, and revisional surgeries for bariatric procedures. We hypothesized that there is a trend away from Roux en Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and laparoscopic adjustable gastric bands (LAGB) in favor of vertical sleeve gastrectomies (VSG). We hypothesized that VSG was associated with fewer revisions and readmissions, and that demographics and comorbidities were associated with surgery received. METHODS We used the US-based Premier database, 2008-2013 and 2014 first and second quarters to 1. Examine trends in incidence of RYGB, LAGB and VSG. 2. Quantify occurrence of revisional surgeries and readmissions. 3. Identify predictors of receipt of procedure and of readmissions. RESULTS The proportion of VSG increased from 3.0 to 54 % from 2008 to 2014. RYGB decreased from 52 % in 2008 to 32 % by 2014. Earlier year, female sex, white race, western (versus southern) region, and Medicaid predicted receipt of RYGB. Later year, male sex, nonwhite race, northeast or western (versus southern) regions, and insurance type predicted VSG. Readmission was less likely for VSG (OR 0.72, 95 % CI 0.65-0.81), male sex (OR 0.83, 95 % CI 0.72-0.95), and more likely for black race (OR Black vs White 1.2, 95 % CI 1.1-1.4). CONCLUSIONS Discharge year strongly predicted surgery type. Females, whites, and Medicaid recipients received RYGB more than referents. Conversely, males, non-whites, and insured patients were more likely to receive VSG. Underinsured, regardless of surgery type, were more likely to be readmitted. These findings have important implications for health policy and cost-containment strategies.","Abraham, Anasooya; Ikramuddin, Sayeed; Jahansouz, Cyrus; Arafat, Fahd; Hevelone, Nathanael; Leslie, Daniel",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-015-1974-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26715330/,354

Pre- and postprocedural MR images and 6-month follow-up MR images for each patient were scored for the presence of postprocedural bland ischemic and hemorrhagic lesions using diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) and T2*-weighted MRI (T2*WI), respectively.RESULTSThe PED group comprised 28 patients with 30 intracranial aneurysms, and the EN group comprised 24 patients with 27 intracranial aneurysms. The mean number of ischemic lesions on DWI 1 day postprocedure was higher in the PED group than in the EN group (5.2 vs 2.7, p = 0.0010). The mean number of microbleeds detected on T2*WI 6 months postprocedure was higher in the PED group than in the EN group (0.6 vs 0.15, p = 0.028). A total of 36.7% of PED-treated patients exhibited new microbleeds on T2*WI at 6 months postprocedure, with at least 77.8% of these lesions representing hemorrhagic transformations of the new ischemic lesions observed on day 1 postprocedure. The rate of adjunctive coil embolization (27.3% vs 0.0%, p = 0.016) and the mean number of ischemic lesions observed 1 day postprocedure (6.6 vs 4.3, p = 0.020) were predictors of subsequent microbleeds in the PED group.CONCLUSIONSNew microbleeds detected using T2*WI at 6 months postprocedure were more common after PED treatment than after stent-mediated embolization. Approximately three-quarters of these lesions were hemorrhagic transformations of new ischemic lesions observed on day 1 postprocedure. Prevention of intraprocedural or postprocedural infarcts is necessary to reduce the risk of hemorrhagic complications following PED placement.","Nakae, Ryuta; Nagaishi, Masaya; Kawamura, Yosuke; Tanaka, Yoshihiro; Hyodo, Akio; Suzuki, Kensuke",Journal of neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.3171/2017.12.jns172480; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29999443/,354

To avoid the undesirable effects of these materials, such as reabsorption, intolerance, granulomas, visualization of the graft's edges, and the migration of the implant, a new technique is proposed that uses a dermic regeneration template (Integra™). The authors have performed 56 surgeries for patients with different indications, and 30 of these patients have been followed up for a minimum of 12 months. The advantage of using this template, a sheet comprising a porous matrix of collagen fibers and glycosaminoglycans, is that it provides a structure for autologous dermic tissue regeneration. Its handling versatility once the silicone sheet is removed allows it to be folded over itself until the needed thickness is obtained as well as the desired aesthetic results. The authors believe that the dermic regeneration template (Integra™) is a good alternative filler material because it is completely reabsorbed and replaced by autologous dermis. The action is not to replace but to help the development of the patient's own tissue, avoiding a possible intolerance because it does not act as a foreign body. The volume remains stable throughout time, and overcorrection is not necessary.","Planas, Jorge",Aesthetic plastic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00266-010-9546-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20680627/,354

Their inactive members, iRhom in Drosophila melanogaster and iRhom1 and iRhom2 in mammals, lack the catalytic center and are hence labelled ""inactive"" rhomboid family members. In mammals, both iRhoms are involved in maturation and trafficking of the ubiquitous transmembrane protease a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) 17, which through cleaving many biologically active molecules has a critical role in tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and Notch signaling. Accordingly, with iRhom2 having a profound influence on ADAM17 activation and substrate specificity it regulates these signaling pathways. Moreover, iRhom2 has a role in the innate immune response to both RNA and DNA viruses and in regulation of keratin subtype expression in wound healing and cancer. Here we review the role of iRhom2 in immunity and disease, both dependent and independent of its regulation of ADAM17.","Al-Salihi, Mazin A; Lang, Philipp A",International journal of molecular sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21186570; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32911849/,354

Recently, the novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has overwhelmed healthcare systems worldwide, as many patients have required hospitalization for the management of respiratory failure similar in nature to ARDS. In addition to lung-protective ventilation strategies aimed to maintain an oxygen saturation >90%, a ratio of partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen >200, a pH of 7.25-7.40, and a plateau pressure <35 cm H2 O, prone positioning has emerged as an effective treatment strategy for severe ARDS by improving oxygenation and secretion clearance. Although early nutrition assessment and intervention are recommended for acutely and critically ill patients, rotational therapy may present challenges in providing this care. Here, we will describe the pathophysiology of ARDS and the rationale for use of prone positioning and review the considerations and challenges of providing nutrition therapy for patients in the prone position.","Behrens, Shay; Kozeniecki, Michelle; Knapp, Nathan; Martindale, Robert G",Nutrition in clinical practice : official publication of the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1002/ncp.10592; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33095474/,354

Diagnostic laboratories testing different types of samples play a vital role in the treatment management. Irrespective of their size, each laboratory has to follow strict biosafety guidelines. Different sections of the laboratory receive samples that are variably infectious. Each sample needs to undergo a proper and well-designed processing system so that the personnel involved are not infected and also their close contacts. It takes a huge effort so as to limit the risk of exposure of the working staff during the collection, processing, reporting or dispatching of biohazard samples. Guidelines help in preventing the laboratory staff and healthcare workers from contracting the disease which has a known human to human route of transmission and high rate of mortality. A well-knit approach is the need of the hour to combat this fast spreading disease. We anticipate that the guidelines described in this article will be useful for continuing safe work practices by all the laboratories in the country.","Misra, Vatsala; Agrawal, Ranjan; Kumar, Harendra; Kar, Asaranti; Kini, Usha; Poojary, Aruna; Chakrabarti, Indranil; Rai, Sharada; Singhal, Anika; Shankar, S Vijay; Iyengar, Jayaram N",Indian journal of pathology & microbiology,https://doi.org/10.4103/ijpm.ijpm_857_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32769321/,354
71982,Treating Low Back Pain in Failed Back Surgery Patients with Multicolumn-lead Spinal Cord Stimulation.,2018,"BACKGROUND A higher incidence of COVID-19 infection was demonstrated in cancer patients, including lung cancer patients. This study was conducted to get insights into the enhanced frequency of COVID-19 infection in this disease. METHODS Using different bioinformatics tools, the expression and methylation patterns of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were analyzed in healthy and malignant tissues, focusing on lung adenocarcinoma and data were correlated to clinical parameters and smoking history. RESULTS ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were heterogeneously expressed across 36 healthy tissues with the highest expression levels in digestive, urinary and reproductive organs, while the overall analysis of 72 paired tissues demonstrated significantly lower expression levels of ACE2 in cancer tissues when compared to normal counterparts. In contrast, ACE2, but not TMPRSS2, was overexpressed in LUAD, which inversely correlated to the promoter methylation. This upregulation of ACE2 was age-dependent in LUAD, but not in normal lung tissues. TMPRSS2 expression in non-neoplastic lung tissues was heterogeneous and dependent on sex and smoking history, while it was downregulated in LUAD of smokers. Cancer progression was associated with a decreased TMPRSS2, but unaltered ACE2. In contrast, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 of lung metastases derived from different cancer subtypes was higher than organ metastases of other sites. TMPRSS2, but not ACE2, was associated with LUAD patients' survival. CONCLUSIONS Comprehensive molecular analyses revealed a heterogeneous and distinct expression and/or methylation profile of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in healthy lung vs. LUAD tissues across sex, age and smoking history and might have implications for COVID-19 disease.","Subbarayan, Karthikeyan; Ulagappan, Kamatchi; Wickenhauser, Claudia; Seliger, Barbara",Current cancer drug targets,https://doi.org/10.2174/1568009620666201207145019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33292131/,354
72415,Severe adenovirus type F enteritis in a young child with acute myeloid leukemia.,2021-05-01,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Walking in water is used for rehabilitation in different pathological conditions. For the characterization of gait alterations related to pathology, gait timing assessment is of primary importance. With the widespread use of inertial sensors, several algorithms have been proposed for gait timing estimation (i.e. gait events and temporal parameters) out of the water, while an assessment of their performance for walking in water is still missing. The purpose of the present study was to assess the performance in the temporal segmentation for gait in water of 17 algorithms proposed in the literature. METHODS Ten healthy volunteers mounting 5 tri-axial inertial sensors (trunk, shanks and feet) walked on dry land and in water. Seventeen different algorithms were implemented and classified based on: 1) sensor position, 2) target variable, and 3) computational approach. Gait events identified from synchronized video recordings were assumed as reference. Temporal parameters were calculated from gait events. Algorithm performance was analysed in terms of sensitivity, positive predictive value, accuracy, and repeatability. RESULTS For walking in water, all Trunk-based algorithms provided a sensitivity lower than 81% and a positive predictive value lower than 94%, as well as acceleration-based algorithms, independently from sensor location, with the exception of two Shank-based ones. Drop in algorithm sensitivity and positive predictive value was associated to significant differences in the stride pattern of the specific analysed variables during walking in water as compared to walking on dry land, as shown by the intraclass correlation coefficient. When using Shank- or Foot-based algorithms, gait events resulted delayed, but the delay was compensated in the estimate of Stride and Step time; a general underestimation of Stance- and overestimation of Swing-time was observed, with minor exceptions. CONCLUSION Sensor position, target variable and computational approach determined different error distributions for different gait events and temporal parameters for walking in water. This work supports an evidence-based selection of the most appropriate algorithm for gait timing estimation for walking in water as related to the specific application, and provides relevant information for the design of new algorithms for the specific motor task.","Pacini Panebianco, Giulia; Bisi, Maria Cristina; Stagni, Rita; Fantozzi, Silvia",Computer methods and programs in biomedicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2020.105703; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818913/,354

Individualized PROMs may be particularly helpful in identifying, prioritizing and monitoring health problems of patients with multimorbidity. We aimed to develop an intervention centred around PROMs feedback as part of Primary Care annual reviews for patients with multimorbidity and evaluate its feasibility and acceptability. METHODS We developed a nurse-oriented intervention including (a) training of nurses on PROMs; (b) administration to patients with multimorbidity of individualized and standardized PROMS; and (c) feedback to both patients and nurses of PROMs scores and interpretation guidance. We then tailored the intervention to patients with two or more highly prevalent conditions (asthma, COPD, diabetes, heart failure, depression, and hip/knee osteoarthritis) and designed a non-controlled feasibility and acceptability evaluation in a convenience sample of primary care practices (5). PROMs were administered and scores fed back immediately ahead of scheduled annual reviews with nurses. Patients and nurses rated the acceptability of the intervention using with a brief survey including optional free comments. Thematic analysis of qualitative interviews with a sample of participating patients (10) and nurses (4) and of survey free comments was conducted for further in-depth evaluation of acceptability. Feasibility was estimated based on rates of participation and completion. RESULTS Out of 68 recruited patients (mean age 70; 47% female), 68 completed the PROMs (100%), received feedback (100%) and confirmed nurse awareness of their scores (100%). Most patients (83%) ""agreed""/""strongly agreed"" that the PROMs feedback had been useful, a view supported by nurses in 89% of reviews. Thematic analysis of rich qualitative data on PROMS administration, feedback and role in annual reviews indicated that both patients and nurses perceived the intervention as acceptable and promising, emphasizing its comprehensiveness and patient-centredness. CONCLUSIONS We have developed and tested an intervention focusing on routine PROM assessment of patients with multimorbidity in Primary Care. Preliminary findings support its feasibility and a high degree of acceptability from both patients and nurses. The next step is to conduct a full-scale trial for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed intervention.","Porter, Ian; Davey, Antoinette; Gangannagaripalli, Jaheeda; Evans, Jonathan; Bramwell, Charlotte; Evans, Philip; Gibbons, Chris; Valderas, Jose M",Health and quality of life outcomes,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12955-021-01748-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33902607/,354

AIMS To determine whether use of subcutaneous heparin during the first 7 days after spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage increases risks of death and disability. METHODS Data are from the Intensive Blood Pressure Reduction in Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage Trial (INTERACT2) study. Patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage (<6 hours) and elevated systolic blood pressure were included; patients received subcutaneous heparin following local best practice standards of care. Multivariable logistic regression and propensity score matched analysis were used to determine associations of heparin use on death and disability (modified Rankin scale) at 90 days. RESULTS In 2525 patients with available data, there were 465 (22.5%) who received subcutaneous heparin. They had higher death or major disability at 90 days in crude (odds ratio 2.29, 95% confidence interval 1.85-2.84; p < 0.001), adjusted (odds ratio 1.62, 95% confidence interval 1.26-2.09; p < 0.001) and propensity score matched (odds ratio 2.06, 95% confidence interval 1.53-2.77; p < 0.001) analyses. In propensity score matched analysis, heparin-treated patients had significant lower mortality (odds ratio 0.55, 95% CI 0.35-0.87; p = 0.01) but greater major disability (odds ratio 1.68, 95% confidence interval 1.25-2.28; p < 0.001) at 90 days. However, no mortality difference was found in analysis restricted to 48-hour survivors. CONCLUSIONS Use of subcutaneous heparin is associated with poor outcome in acute intracerebral hemorrhage, driven by increased residual disability. Despite the limitations of this study, and no clear relation of heparin with bleeding risk, we recommend careful consideration of the need for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis with heparin in intracerebral hemorrhage patients.

76172,Polymyxin B-immobilized fiber column direct hemoperfusion and continuous hemodiafiltration in premature neonates with systemic inflammatory response syndrome.,2016,"UNLABELLED Rotaviruses (RVs) enter cells through different endocytic pathways. Bovine rotavirus (BRV) UK uses clathrin-mediated endocytosis, while rhesus rotavirus (RRV) employs an endocytic process independent of clathrin and caveolin. Given the differences in the cell internalization pathway used by these viruses, we tested if the intracellular trafficking of BRV UK was the same as that of RRV, which is known to reach maturing endosomes (MEs) to infect the cell. We found that BRV UK also reaches MEs, since its infectivity depends on the function of Rab5, the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT), and the formation of endosomal intraluminal vesicles (ILVs). However, unlike RRV, the infectivity of BRV UK was inhibited by knocking down the expression of Rab7, indicating that it has to traffic to late endosomes (LEs) to infect the cell. The requirement for Rab7 was also shared by other RV strains of human and porcine origin. Of interest, most RV strains that reach LEs were also found to depend on the activities of Rab9, the cation-dependent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CD-M6PR), and cathepsins B, L, and S, suggesting that cellular factors from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) need to be transported by the CD-M6PR to LEs to facilitate RV cell infection. Furthermore, using a collection of UK × RRV reassortant viruses, we found that the dependence of BRV UK on Rab7, Rab9, and CD-M6PR is associated with the spike protein VP4. These findings illustrate the elaborate pathway of RV entry and reveal a new process (Rab9/CD-M6PR/cathepsins) that could be targeted for drug intervention. IMPORTANCE Rotavirus is an important etiological agent of severe gastroenteritis in children. In most instances, viruses enter cells through an endocytic pathway that delivers the viral particle to vesicular organelles known as early endosomes (EEs). Some viruses reach the cytoplasm from EEs, where they start to replicate their genome. However, other viruses go deeper into the cell, trafficking from EEs to late endosomes (LEs) to disassemble and reach the cytoplasm. In this work, we show that most RV strains have to traffic to LEs, and the transport of endolysosomal proteases from the Golgi complex to LEs, mediated by the mannose-6-phosphate receptor, is necessary for the virus to exit the vesicular compartment and efficiently start viral replication. We also show that this deep journey into the cell is associated with the virus spike protein VP4. These findings illustrate the elaborate pathway of RV entry that could be used for drug intervention.","Díaz-Salinas, Marco A; Silva-Ayala, Daniela; López, Susana; Arias, Carlos F",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.03457-13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24501398/,354

Here, we performed a scoping review and meta-analysis including clinical studies on patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection with data on AKI assessment and characteristics, and the overall prevalence of AKI was estimated using a random-effects model. We identified 21 articles which passed the search criteria. All were quantitative observational studies which used a cross-sectional, retrospective, case report, or cohort methodology. This showed that aging, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, previous chronic disease, and other comorbidities were risk factors of AKI. Although the prevalence of proteinuria, hematuria, and increased serum creatinine was reported for up to 60% of the patients with COVID-19, the overall prevalence of AKI was estimated to be 8%. We conclude that although approximately two-thirds of patients with COVID-19 had symptoms of kidney damage, most of these did not meet the diagnostic criteria for AKI.

OBJECTIVE To assess the changes to fluid dynamics within an aneurysm by studying two different endoluminal flow diverters on a simple aneurysm model, using tomographic particle image velocimetry to determine which device would better minimize fluid flow into an aneurysm and observe any significant changes in aneurysm fluid structures. METHODS Steady velocity fields of the model's aneurysm dome and neck were measured at three inlet velocities (18, 39, and 59 cm/s) for two flow diverter diameters with different porosities and compared against a baseline case with no flow diverter. RESULTS In the baseline case a large vortex was present inside the dome for all flow rates. However, both devices eliminated this main vortex at all flow rates and reduced the peak aneurysmal velocities by about 90%. A strong correlation between flow diverter porosity and flow reduction was found. In each case the inflow to the aneurysm shifted from the distal neck to the mid- or proximal neck after flow diverter placement. CONCLUSIONS Even with this relatively simple experimental setup, we were able to observe the major flow field changes, which occurred immediately after the deployment of each flow diverter. Limitations of the study included a simplified geometry and steady-state flow. Constraints included model making and limited availability of flow diverters.","Dennis, Kendall D; Rossman, Timothy L; Kallmes, David F; Dragomir-Daescu, Dan",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2014-011323; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25280567/,354

Water resources management is, perhaps, the most drastic change observed in the coastal environment. However, external forcings such as the El Niño event have important implications in the global and regional hydrological balance. These environmental changes have an impact on the density and biomass of the ichthyofauna in the Terminos Lagoon (TL) for the past 30 years, presumably, associated with variations in the temperature and surface salinity of the sea. Therefore, in the present study, δ18O was quantified in otoliths of two important species due to their dominance: Stellifer lanceolatus and Eucinostomus gula, and to understand the environmental changes reflected in both species. The δ18O was analyzed in otoliths of these two species captured in 1998/1997, 2006/2007 and 2016/2017 and were compared with in situ temperature and salinity data. Sea surface temperature and salinity increased by 2 °C and 9, respectively, between 1997 and 2017. Stellifer lanceolatus δ18O values was in isotopic equilibrium with seawater calcite; while, E. gula is not in isotopic equilibrium. The δ18O of S. lanceolatus and E. gula varied significantly with the increase in salinity (R2 = 0.8987 and R2 = -0.2964) and not with the sea surface temperature.

Progress in TB care and prevention has been very slow. In 2019, TB remained the most common cause of death from a single infectious pathogen. Globally, an estimated 10.0 million people developed TB disease in 2019, and there were an estimated 1.2 million TB deaths among HIV-negative people and an additional 208, 000 deaths among people living with HIV. Adults accounted for 88% and children for 12% of people with TB. The WHO regions of South-East Asia (44%), Africa (25%), and the Western Pacific (18%) had the most people with TB. Eight countries accounted for two thirds of the global total: India (26%), Indonesia (8.5%), China (8.4%), the Philippines (6.0%), Pakistan (5.7%), Nigeria (4.4%), Bangladesh (3.6%) and South Africa (3.6%). Only 30% of the 3.5 million five-year target for children treated for TB was met. Major advances have been development of new all oral regimens for MDRTB and new regimens for preventive therapy. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic dislodged TB from the top infectious disease cause of mortality globally. Notably, global TB control efforts were not on track even before the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many challenges remain to improve sub-optimal TB treatment and prevention services. Tuberculosis screening and diagnostic test services need to be ramped up. The major drivers of TB remain undernutrition, poverty, diabetes, tobacco smoking, and household air pollution and these need be addressed to achieve the WHO 2035 TB care and prevention targets. National programs need to include interventions for post-tuberculosis holistic wellbeing.

Specifically, our findings revealed that high levels of anxiety about COVID-19, increased substance use and loneliness as the strongest predictors of distress, while gross annual incomes and loneliness were strongest predictors of well-being. Finding of the present study provide a better insight about psychological adjustment to a pandemic and allows us to identify which population groups are at risk of experiencing higher levels of distress and which factors contribute to greater well-being, which could help in the treatments and prevention in similar stressful and traumatic situations.","Valiente, Carmen; Contreras, Alba; Peinado, Vanesa; Trucharte, Almudena; Martínez, Antón P; Vázquez, Carmelo",The Spanish journal of psychology,https://doi.org/10.1017/sjp.2021.7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33551011/,354
82078,Low-dose fixed-target serial synchrotron crystallography.,2017,"BACKGROUND Recently, the need for rapid wound-healing has significantly increased because of the increasing number of patients who are diagnosed with diabetes and obesity. These conditions have contributed to a surge in the number of patients with chronic wounds worldwide. Furthermore, many cost-effective wound-healing technologies have been developed in order to keep up with the increased demand. In this paper, we performed a quantitative study of the trends associated with wound-healing technologies using patent data. METHODOLOGY We analyzed the trends considering four different groups of patent applicants: firms, universities, research institutes, and individuals using a structural topic model. In addition, we analyzed the knowledge flow between patent applicants using citation analysis, and confirmed the role of applicants in the knowledge-flow network using k-means clustering. As a result, the primary wound-healing technology patents applied for by the four groups varied considerably, and we classified the roles of patent applicants were found in the knowledge-flow network. CONCLUSIONS Our results showed the organizations that are leading each area of wound-healing technology. Furthermore, from the results, we identified specific institutions that are efficient for spreading knowledge related to wound-healing technology based on the patents. This information can contribute to the planning of investment strategies and technology policies related to wound-healing.","Gwak, Jae Ha; Sohn, So Young",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0174203; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28306732/,354
82209,Stent fractures after superficial femoral artery stenting: risk factors and impact on patency.,2015,"PURPOSE Because of the widespread use of CT in the diagnosis of COVID 19, indeterminate presentations such as single, few or unilateral lesions amount to a considerable number. We aimed to develop a new classification and structured reporting system on CT imaging (COVID-19 S) that would facilitate the diagnosis of COVID-19 in the most accurate way. METHODS Our retrospective cohort included 803 patients with a chest CT scan upon suspicion of COVID 19. The patients' history, physical examination, CT findings, RT PCR, and other laboratory test results were reviewed, and a final diagnosis was made as COVID 19 or non-COVID 19. Chest CT scans were classified according to the COVID 19 S CT diagnosis criteria. Cohen's kappa analysis was used. RESULTS Final clinical diagnosis was COVID-19 in 98 patients (12%). According to the COVID-19 S CT diagnosis criteria, the number of patients in the normal, compatible with COVID 19, indeterminate and alternative diagnosis groups were 581 (72.3%), 97 (12.1%), 16 (2.0%) and 109 (13.6%). When the indeterminate group was combined with the group compatible with COVID 19, the sensitivity and specificity of COVID-19 S were 99.0% and 87.1%, with 85.8% positive predictive value (PPV) and 99.1% negative predictive value (NPV). When the indeterminate group was combined with the alternative diagnosis group, the sensitivity and specificity of COVID-19 S were 93.9% and 96.0%, with 94.8% PPV and 95.2% NPV. CONCLUSION COVID-19 S CT classification system may meet the needs of radiologists in distinguishing COVID-19 from pneumonia of other etiologies and help optimize patient management and disease control in this pandemic by the use of structured reporting.","Gezer, Naciye Sinem; Ergan, Begüm; Barış, Mustafa Mahmut; Appak, Özgür; Sayıner, Ayça Arzu; Balcı, Pınar; Kuruüzüm, Ziya; Çavuş, Sema Alp; Kılınç, Oğuz",Diagnostic and interventional radiology,https://doi.org/10.5152/dir.2020.20351; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32558646/,354

IBV strains were divided into four genotypes by the analysis of the S1 gene region. Four strains belonged to the Massachusetts genotype, one strain was placed into the QX genotype, one strain formed a cluster together with the B1648 strain and nine strains were classified into the 624/I genotype. Nine Slovenian strains of the 624/I genotype formed two subgroups independently of the time of isolation and the geographical origin. Phylogenetic analysis of the partial N gene sequences revealed lower sequence variability and different clustering of the Slovenian IBV. Fourteen strains were grouped together with the strains H120 and D1466.

84611,Ten best practices for taking experiential learning online.,2020-12-14,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE To describe our first experience using a small stent retriever specifically designed for thrombectomy in cerebral arteries with a small caliber (Acandis APERIO® 3.5/28) in patients with acute ischemic stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS All patients with an acute ischemic stroke, who underwent endovascular recanalization using the APERIO® thrombectomy device with a diameter of 3.5 mm, were identified in retrospect and included in the present analysis. Demographic and clinical data as well as data on the procedures performed were collected (patient sex, mean age, NIHSS, mRS, TICI score, and complications). RESULTS Stent retriever-based thrombectomy with the Aperio® 3.5/28 alone (n = 10 vessels) or in combination with other devices (n = 13 vessels) was performed in 22 acute stroke patients with embolic occlusions of distal branches of the anterior and posterior circulations (median NIHSS = 8.5). For vessels treated with the Aperio® 3.5/28, we achieved a TICI 2b/3 reperfusion rate of 73.9%. One patient suffered a symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage after thrombectomy; otherwise, no procedure-related complications were seen. CONCLUSION Our data suggest that mechanical thrombectomy of distal cerebral artery occlusions with the Aperio® 3.5/28 is feasible and in general safe, thus offering a promising option for endovascular stroke therapy. However, multicentric studies with larger patient cohorts are necessary to evaluate the clinical benefit.","Müller-Eschner, Monika; You, Se-Jong; Jahnke, Kolja; Kammerer, Sara; Foerch, Christian; Pfeilschifter, Waltraud; Lauer, Arne; Berkefeld, Joachim; Wagner, Marlies",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00270-018-2039-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30039501/,354

Some case reports present schwannomas arising from the brainstem, but regrowth of the tumor and the efficacy of postoperative irradiation have not been examined. In addition, the genetic background of schwannomas arising from the brainstem has not been investigated. CASE PRESENTATION A 21-year-old male presented with diplopia, dysphagia, and left-sided hemiparesis, dysesthesia, and ataxia. Intracranial imaging showed a heterogeneous mass with a cystic lesion in the pontomedullary junction. Since the tumor caused obstructive hydrocephalus, the patient underwent subtotal tumor resection. A histopathologic evaluation aided a diagnosis of brainstem intraparenchymal schwannoma. Gradual postoperative mass regrowth was recognized. Three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy was performed on the residual mass and surgical cavity. No tumor regrowth was observed 4 years after surgery. To investigate the genetic background of the tumor, target sequences for 36 genes, including NF2, SMARCB1, and LZTR1, and microsatellite analysis for loss of 22q did not show any somatic variants or 22q loss. CONCLUSIONS We suggest that brainstem schwannomas might differ from conventional schwannomas in their genetic background.","Ishigami, Daiichiro; Miyawaki, Satoru; Nakatomi, Hirofumi; Takayanagi, Shunsaku; Teranishi, Yu; Ohara, Kenta; Hongo, Hiroki; Dofuku, Shogo; Kin, Taichi; Abe, Hiroyuki; Mitsui, Jun; Komura, Daisuke; Katoh, Hiroto; Ishikawa, Shumpei; Saito, Nobuhito",BMC medical genomics,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12920-021-01049-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34407809/,354

In Japan, more than 30 000 people died by suicide every year between 1998 and 2011, and the Japanese government, local governments, and various other agencies have been working on suicide prevention programs to reduce the suicide rate. While the number of suicides is still high (more than 20 000 per year), many specialists are striving to further reduce the number of suicides in Japan. The Japanese government has played a central role in suicide prevention through the enactment of several laws, and in recent years, suicide prevention has shifted from government to community-specific measures. This review discusses the suicide prevention measures that have been taken so far: (1) policy strategies for suicide prevention by the Japanese government, (2) community suicide prevention, and (3) strategic studies for suicide prevention. Finally, as shown in the ACTION-J study, we conclude that cooperation among related organizations in the community, not just one institution, is important for future suicide prevention, especially youth suicide prevention.","Okamura, Kazuya; Ikeshita, Katsumi; Kimoto, Sohei; Makinodan, Manabu; Kishimoto, Toshifumi",Asia-Pacific psychiatry : official journal of the Pacific Rim College of Psychiatrists,https://doi.org/10.1111/appy.12471; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33787084/,354

Monthly interviews (N = 32) were conducted with champions who were conducting a PAL Card quality improvement project in Tennessee nursing homes (N = 11) between March and August 2020. Three major themes emerged: Structural Changes (e.g., halting admissions, adding an isolation unit), Resident Burden (e.g., physical isolation, loneliness), and Provider Burnout (e.g., increased workload, mental exhaustion). Further, providers expressed the benefits to using PAL Cards, specifically in regard to blunting the negative impact of each theme. Results showed the overall negative impact of COVID-19 on nursing home communities. Nursing staff experienced greater burden than other staff, reflecting their prominent role in providing direct care to residents with COVID-19. Staff reported that PAL Cards helped promote PCC.

The purpose of this study is to describe the calls received by the Tele-Medical Assistance Service (TMAS) in relation to this epidemic. Methods: From March 1 to 30 April 30, 2020, all records coded by TMAS doctors as ""influenza due to an unidentified virus"" were extracted. The following data were collected: patients' age, gender, nationality, role on board, type of ship, area of navigation, reason for the teleconsultation, patient's symptoms, whether or not a COVID test had been carried out, and treatment given. The data were analyzed in two groups, depending on the reason for the consultation: teleconsultation for suspected COVID patients and teleconsultation for non-COVID patients for whom the call was nevertheless related to the COVID pandemic. Results: Sixty-one records were included-51 for suspected COVID patients and 10 records for COVID-related problems (six patients whose treatment had stopped due to shortage of medication/one patient reporting a psychiatric problem associated with isolation, three patients followed up as contact cases). Forty-five patients presented with fever when the first call was made (88%) and 39 had a cough (76%). On closure of the medical records, 33 were receiving treatment on board (65%), 10 had disembarked (20%), 1 had been rerouted (2%), and 7 had been evacuated (13%).

METHOD A video on the use of ICG to assess bowel perfusion after intestinal resection and on the use of intra-ureteral perfusion of ICG. A 6 Fr ureteral catheter was introduced in to each ureters at cystoscopy and 7 ml ICG solution (1,25mg/ml of distilled water) was injected. The catheter was then removed. Using a near- infrared camera (OLYMPUS Medical System Europa and STRYKER Iberia S.L. Madrid,Spain), the fluorescent ureters could be visualized at laparoscopy. After rectal segmental resection, 4ml of ICG solution was injected intravenously to check the vascularity at the site of transection and the anastomosis further checked at ICG-rectoscopy, using a 12 mm- Kii balloon blunt tip (Applied Medical, Europe) RESULTS: The ICG fluorescence may have a role in helping to identify and follow the course of the pelvic ureter especially when the anatomy is distorted. It has the added advantage ureteral fluorescence is detectable for at least 6 hours after injection of ICG. Intravenous ICG also provided a visual assessment of anastomotic perfusion after discoid and segmental bowel resections at laparoscopy and rectoscopy. CONCLUSION(S) ICG enhanced-fluorescence is a feasible, safe and reproducible technology in DIE surgery. It provides a real time evaluation of ureters and bowel.

Due to the lack of good clinical studies involving adequate monitoring and reversal therapies, management requires knowledge and understanding of pharmacokinetics, renal function, drug interactions, and evaluation of the surgical bleeding risk. Consideration of the benefit of reversal of anticoagulation is important and, for some low risk bleeding procedures, it may be in the patient's interest to continue anticoagulation. In case of major intra-operative bleeding in patients likely to have therapeutic or supra-therapeutic levels of anticoagulation, specific reversal agents/antidotes would be of value but are currently lacking. As a consequence, a multimodal approach should be taken which includes the administration of 25 to 50 U/kg 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrates or 30 to 50 U/kg activated prothrombin complex concentrate (FEIBA®) in some life-threatening situations.

Objective To compare pharmacological therapies for neonatal abstinence syndrome. Data Sources Systematic review and network meta-analysis of Medline (1946-June 2018), Embase (1974-June 2018), Cochrane CENTRAL (1966-June 2018), Web of Science (1900-June 2018), and ClinicalTrials.gov (June 2018). Study Selection Randomized clinical trials of pharmacological treatments for neonatal abstinence syndrome alone or in combination with adjuvant treatments. Abstract, title, and full-text screening were conducted independently by 2 reviewers (T.D. and C.G.). Data Extraction and Synthesis Data extraction was conducted independently by 2 reviewers (T.D. and C.G.) according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA)-Network Meta-Analyses guidelines. Quality was assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and data were pooled with fixed-effect models as a result of the low number of trials that were included in the analysis. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was the length of treatment. The length of stay, need for adjuvant therapy, and adverse events were considered as secondary outcomes. Results Eighteen trials (N = 1072) were eligible for inclusion. The treatments that were included in the length of treatment analysis were buprenorphine, clonidine, diluted tincture of opium and clonidine, diluted tincture of opium, morphine, methadone, and phenobarbital. Sublingual buprenorphine was considered the optimal treatment for a reduction in the length of treatment (days: mean difference vs morphine, -12.75 [95% CI, -17.97 to -7.58]; median rank, 1 [3-1]) and length of stay (days: mean difference vs morphine, -11.43 [95% CI, -16.95 to -5.82]; median rank, 1 [3-1]) but not the need for adjuvant treatment (odds ratio vs morphine, 1.23 [95% CI, 0.46-3.44]; median rank, 3 [5-1]). The results were robust to bias but sensitive to imprecision. Conclusions and Relevance The current evidence suggests that buprenorphine is the optimal treatment for neonatal abstinence treatment, but limitations are considerable and wide-scale adoption requires a large multisite trial. Morphine, which is considered standard of care in most hospitals, was the lowest-ranked opioid for length of treatment and length of stay.","Disher, Timothy; Gullickson, Courtney; Singh, Balpreet; Cameron, Chris; Boulos, Leah; Beaubien, Louis; Campbell-Yeo, Marsha",JAMA pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2018.5044; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30667476/,354

He had a mild Ebstein cardiac anomaly but otherwise a normal past history and growth. On examination, he looked ill, his temperature was 37.5 °C, circulation was poor, and there were several purpuric lesions on the face, hands and scrotum. Haemoglobin was 7.8 g/dL (11-14), total white cell count 27 × 109/L, platelets 62 × 109/L, blood urea nitrogen 20.7 mmol/L (4.2-17.1), serum creatinine 95.4 μmol/L (21.2-36.2), CRP 154 mg/L (<5), AST 296 U/L (11-50), ALT 909 U/L (7-40) and C3 component of complement 0.8 g/L (0.9-1.8). Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and prothrombin time (PT) were prolonged and fibrinogen level was 1.0 g/L (2-4). He received immediate fluid resuscitation (IV 0.9% saline solution, 2 × 10 ml/kg boluses, followed by glucose 5/0.45% sodium chloride solution, 2 × 10 ml/kg) and antibiotics (ciprofloxacin and amikacin) but circulation continued to deteriorate with development of decreased consciousness. He was placed on mechanical ventilation and vasopressor agents were added. Despite improved circulation over the next 2 days, he developed oliguria, progressive fluid overload, generalised oedema and a right-sided pleural effusion. Dialysis was commenced on day 3 of admission. Differential diagnosis included sepsis, atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome and lupus nephritis. Blood and urine cultures remained negative but an anti-streptolysin O titre of 1318 (<200) IU/mL led to the diagnosis of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome which is rare in early childhood and associated with high mortality. Haemodialysis was commenced and continued for 10 days with successful treatment of fluid overload and subsequent extubation. Renal function was completely restored over the following 6 weeks and he was discharged in good clinical condition about 2 months after intial admission. The clinical course and outcome are discussed, and the importance of timely initiation of dialysis when there is fluid overload is emphasised.","Keenswijk, Werner; Vande Walle, Johan",Paediatrics and international child health,https://doi.org/10.1080/20469047.2017.1315913; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28426384/,354

Participants included 401 day-shift workers employed in a random sampling of 34 Canadian workplaces. The 16-item Maslach Burnout Inventory was used to extract burnout sub-scales that included emotional exhaustion, cynicism, professional inefficacy, as well as a global burnout average. Consenting workers provided five saliva samples a day (awaking, 30 min after awaking, 1,400 h, 1,600 h, and bedtime) repeated three times over the course of a week (Saturday, Tuesday, Thursday) to capture workday and non-workday variations. Multilevel regression models were estimated from cortisol measurements at each occasion within a day at level-1, workers at level-2, and workplaces at level-3. Multilevel regression analyses found that emotional exhaustion and a global burnout showed the strongest and consistent negative associations to cortisol in the afternoon and evening. In a separate analysis using regression coefficients, emotional exhaustion and a global burnout average were associated with low cortisol levels 30 min upon awakening. By contrast, professional inefficacy was associated only with lower bedtime cortisol. No associations were detected for cynicism and sex did not emerge as a moderator in secondary analyses. Our findings are discussed in a theoretical framework postulating different pathophysiological stages of burnout development. Specifically, professional inefficacy may be the earliest warning signal culminating with emotional exhaustion that may dampen diurnal cortisol levels.","Marchand, Alain; Juster, Robert-Paul; Durand, Pierre; Lupien, Sonia J",Psychoneuroendocrinology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2013.10.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24485473/,354

To bypass the constraints of quasi-continuous recording, progressive measurements of O2 partial pressure (PO2 ) in rhythmically contracting skeletal muscle were compiled to describe the O2 kinetics surrounding and including a single muscle contraction. Phosphorescence quenching microscopy measured PO2 in the interstitium of the rat spinotrapezius muscle. Measurements were triggered by contraction-inducing electrical pulses. For the first 60 seconds, measurement preceeded stimulation. After 60, measurement followed with a progressive 20 ms increment. Thus, the first 60 measurements describe the overall PO2 response to electrical stimulation initiated after a 10 second rest period, while 61-100 (stroboscopic mode) were compiled into a single 800 ms profile of the PO2 transient surrounding muscle contraction. Thirty seconds of stimulated contractions decreased interstitial PO2 from a baseline of 71 ± 1.4 mmHg to an ""active"" steady-state of 43 ± 1.5 mmHg. The stroboscopic mode compilation revealed an unexpected post-contractile rise in PO2 as a 205 ms spike with a maximum amplitude of 58 ± 3.8 mmHg at 68 ms, which restored 58% of the PO2 drop from baseline. Interpretation of this phenomenon is based on classical experiments by G.V. Anrep (1935), who discovered the rapid thrust of blood flow associated with muscle contraction. In addition to the metabolic implications during exercise, the physiological impact of these PO2 spikes may grow with an increased rate of rhythmical contractions in muscle or heart. NEW&NOTEWORTHY: The principal finding is a spike of interstitial PO2 , produced by a twitch in a rhythmically contracting muscle. A possible mechanism is flushing capillaries with arterial blood by mechanical forces. A technical novelty is the PO2 measurement with a ""stroboscopic mode"" and progressively increasing delay between stimulator pulse and PO2 measuring. That permitted a 20 ms time resolution for a 205 ms spike duration, using an excitation flash rate one per second.","Golub, Aleksander S; Nugent, William H; Song, Bjorn K",Physiological reports,https://doi.org/10.14814/phy2.14699; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33400848/,354

METHODS We developed a soft-light overhead illumination system (SOIS) that produced attached shadows on objects. We compared results using the SOIS with those using a conventional illumination system with regard to laparoscopic experience and laparoscope-to-target distances (LTDs). Forty-two medical students and 23 surgeons participated in the study. A peg transfer task (LTD, 120 mm) for students and surgeons, and a suture removal task (LTD, 30 mm) for students were performed. Illumination systems were randomly assigned to each task. Endpoints were: total number of peg transfers; percentage of peg-dropping errors; and total execution time for suture removal. After the task, participants filled out a questionnaire on their preference for a particular illumination system. RESULTS Total number of peg transfers was greater with the SOIS for both students and surgeons. Percentage of peg-dropping errors for surgeons was lower with the SOIS. Total execution time for suture removal was shorter with the SOIS. Forty-five participants (69% in total) evaluated the SOIS for easier task performance. CONCLUSIONS The present results confirm that the SOIS improves laparoscopic task performance, regardless of previous laparoscopic experience or LTD.","Takai, Akihiro; Takada, Yasutsugu; Motomura, Hideki; Teramukai, Satoshi","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",https://doi.org/10.1097/sle.0b013e31828f7245; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24487158/,354

Multiplex PCR, which can simultaneously detect various respiratory pathogens, is currently used worldwide. Recently, a new type of multiplexed molecular test using a fully automated workflow system was developed, which was also adapted to our laboratory. In this study, we assessed improvements in laboratory practice brought about by the implementation of the rapid test for the detection of respiratory viruses. METHODS We investigated the number of routine and rapid tests conducted as well as the change in monthly test frequency of the routine test. We also analyzed the waiting time, turnaround time, and lead time for the routine and rapid tests. The Anyplex II RV16 detection kit (Seegene, Seoul, Korea) and Filmarray Respiratory Panel (BioFire Diagnostics, Inc., Salt Lake City, UT, USA) were used for the routine and rapid tests, respectively. RESULTS Compared to the routine test, the rapid test significantly (p < 0.01) decreased the mean waiting time (1 hour 46 minutes), turnaround time (1 hour 45 minutes), and lead time (3 hours 32 minutes). After the implementation of the rapid test, the number of routine tests conducted was reduced over the 5-month period, from 13 times a month to 3 times a month. CONCLUSIONS The implementation of the rapid test for the detection of respiratory viruses improved the diagnostic efficiency of the laboratory and greatly reduced lead time.","Lee, Jae Min; Lee, Jong Ho; Kim, Yu Kyung",Clinical laboratory,https://doi.org/10.7754/clin.lab.2018.180411; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30274011/,354

However, studies, so far, have employed supervised resistance exercise in a laboratory or gym facility which limits the future translation of such exercise in to clinical practice and recommendations. Our primary aim, therefore, is to test the hypothesis, in a randomized controlled trial, that home-based resistance exercise training and gym-based resistance exercise training both reduce HbA1c levels in people with type 2 diabetes compared to control. We will also investigate the effects of home- and gym-based resistance exercise training on muscle strength and body composition. METHODS The current study is a three-arm randomised controlled trial which will be conducted with 150 eligible people with type 2 diabetes to compare home-and gym-based resistance exercise training with usual care in Kuwait. The interventions will be delivered by exercise specialists and last for 32 weeks. The primary outcomes are HbA1c with secondary outcomes measuring muscle function, body composition, physical activity and quality of life.

98895,Synergetic use of neural precursor cells and self-assembling peptides in experimental cervical spinal cord injury.,2015,"AIMS Atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF) often coexist. Catheter ablation has been reported to restore left ventricular (LV) function but patients benefit differently. This study investigated the correlation between left atrial (LA) fibrosis extent and LV ejection fraction (LVEF) recovery after AF ablation. METHODS AND RESULTS In this study, 103 patients [64 years, 69% men, 79% persistent AF, LVEF 33% interquartile range (IQR) (25-38)] undergoing first time AF ablation were investigated. Identification of LA fibrosis and selection of ablation strategy were based on sinus rhythm voltage mapping. Continuous rhythm monitoring was used to assess ablation success. Improvement in post-ablation LVEF was measured as primary study endpoint. An absolute increase in post-ablation LVEF ≥10% was defined as 'Super Response'. Left atrial fibrosis was present in 38% of patients. After ablation LVEF increased by absolute 15% (IQR 6-25) (P < 0.001). Left ventricular ejection fraction improvement was higher in patients without LA fibrosis [15% (IQR 10-25) vs. 10% (IQR 0-20), P < 0.001]. An inverse correlation between LVEF improvement and the extent of LA fibrosis was found (R2 = 0.931). In multivariate analysis, the presence of LA fibrosis was the only independent predictor for failing LVEF improvement [odds ratio 7.2 (95% confidence interval 2.2-23.4), P < 0.001]. Echocardiographic 'Super Response' was observed in 55/64 (86%) patients without and 21/39 (54%) patients with LA fibrosis, respectively (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION Presence and extent of LA fibrosis predict LVEF response in HF patients undergoing AF ablation. The assessment of LA fibrosis may impact prognostic stratification and clinical management in HF patients with AF.","Kirstein, Bettina; Neudeck, Sebastian; Gaspar, Thomas; Piorkowski, Judith; Wechselberger, Simon; Kronborg, Mads Brix; Zedda, Angela; Hankel, Anastasia; El-Armouche, Ali; Tomala, Jakub; Schmidt, Thomas; Mayer, Julia; Wagner, Michael; Ulbrich, Stefan; Pu, Liying; Richter, Utz; Huo, Yan; Piorkowski, Christopher","Europace : European pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac electrophysiology : journal of the working groups on cardiac pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac cellular electrophysiology of the European Society of Cardiology",https://doi.org/10.1093/europace/euaa179; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830233/,354

We report the outcomes of our early experience with SPA colorectal resections in comparison with CL surgery. METHODS We compared the following data, patient characteristics, operating time, morbidity, operative mortality, length of hospital stay and tumour variables, of patients who underwent SPA right, left, sigmoid and total colon resections, as well as high anterior resections and panproctocolectomies, with that of patients who underwent equivalent conventional laparoscopic (CL) operations. The 40 SPA and 78 CL patients studied underwent surgery between February 2008 and September 2011. RESULTS There was no difference between the SPA and CL operations, as regards the patient's sex (55.0 vs. 62.8% males, p = 0.411), comorbidity (ASA I 10.0 vs. 12.8%; ASA II 57.5 vs. 59.0%; ASA III 32.5 vs. 25.6%; ASA IV 0 vs. 2.6%, p = 0.722) and body mass index (26.2 vs. 28.0 kg/m(2), p = 0.073). However, SPA patients were younger (mean age 54.1 vs. 64.8 years, p = 0.001), and malignancy was a less common indication for surgery (25.0 vs. 71.8%, p < 0.001). There were no conversions to open surgery, and one death occurred in the CL group (1.3%). Mean operating time (162 vs. 170 min, p = 0.547), median post-operative hospital stay (4 vs. 4 days, p = 0.255) and morbidity (7.5 vs. 12.8%, p = 0.538) were comparable. CONCLUSIONS SPA laparoscopic surgery appears safe in the hands of experienced laparoscopic surgeons, with no increase in operating time, length of stay, morbidity and mortality. Selection of patients with indications for surgery for benign disease may be of importance to ensure an oncologically safe initial uptake of SPA colorectal practice.","Kanakala, V; Borowski, D W; Agarwal, A K; Tabaqchali, M A; Garg, D K; Gill, T S",Techniques in coloproctology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10151-012-0839-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22614072/,354

Due to improvements in surgical technique and equipment, single-port VATS (s-VATS) is emerging as an alternative approach to conventional three-port VATS (t-VATS). The aim of this study was to evaluate s-VATS as a treatment for PSP by comparing operative outcomes and recurrence rates for s-VATS versus t-VATS. METHODS Between March 2013 and December 2015, VATS for PSP was performed in 146 patients in Kyungpook National University Hospital. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of these patients. RESULTS The mean follow-up duration was 13.4±6.5 months in the s-VATS group and 28.7±3.9 months in the t-VATS group. Operative time (p<0.001), the number of staples used for the operation (p=0.001), duration of drainage (p=0.001), and duration of the postoperative stay (p<0.001) were significantly lower in the s-VATS group than in the t-VATS group. There was no difference in the overall recurrence-free survival rate between the s-VATS and t-VATS groups. CONCLUSION No significant differences in operative outcomes and recurrence rates were found between s-VATS and t-VATS for PSP. Therefore, we cautiously suggest that s-VATS may be an appropriate alternative to t-VATS in the treatment of PSP.","Jung, Hanna; Oh, Tak Hyuk; Cho, Joon Yong; Lee, Deok Heon",The Korean journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.5090/kjtcs.2017.50.3.184; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28593154/,354

Physical examination revealed a 2 cm rectal prolapse, hepatomegaly and a low body condition score of 3/9. Haematology and biochemistry revealed a mild non-regenerative anaemia (haematocrit 24.5%; reference interval [RI] 30.3-52.3%), a mild mature neutrophilia (16.21 × 109/l; RI 1.48-10.29 × 109/l) and a mild increase in alanine aminotransferase activity (222 IU/l; RI 12-130 IU/l). Abdominal radiographs identified hepatomegaly. The rectal prolapse was reduced under general anaesthesia. Abdominal ultrasound identified a caecocolic intussusception and a large hepatic mass. Thoracic radiographs were unremarkable. Hepatic fine-needle aspirate cytology revealed well-differentiated hepatocytes. A typhlectomy was performed and the quadrate liver lobe, with mass, was resected. Gross examination of the caecum identified a focal polyp; histopathology showed moderate plasmacytic-lymphocytic typhlitis and reactive mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue. The hepatic mass was diagnosed as a well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma. Six weeks postoperatively the cat had gained 0.5 kg, had an improved body condition score of 5/9 and resolution of clinical signs. The cat died acutely 1 year later from an unknown cause. RELEVANCE AND NOVEL INFORMATION Caecocolic intussusception is rare in cats and uncommon in dogs. This is the third report in a cat and the first associated with a caecal polyp. As reported in dogs, the outcome following surgery was good. Hepatocellular carcinoma is a rarely reported feline neoplasm, which may have a good prognosis with surgical resection.","Boland, Lara; Lindsay, Scott; Brunel, Laurencie; Podadera, Juan; Bennett, Peter",JFMS open reports,https://doi.org/10.1177/2055116917706652; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28491458/,354
102022,Mucosal Lactobacillus vectored vaccines.,2013,"BACKGROUND Adults with learning disabilities have an increased disposition to unhealthy lifestyle behaviours which often occur simultaneously. Existing studies focus on complex interventions targeting unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, sedentary behaviour, smoking, and alcohol use to reduce health risks experienced. It is essential to understand how well these interventions work, what works, for whom, in what context and why. This study aims to investigate the effectiveness and underlying mechanisms of lifestyle modification interventions for adults with learning disabilities. METHODS This is a mixed-methods systematic review consisting of a network meta-analysis (NMA) and realist synthesis. Electronic databases (ASSIA, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO) will be searched from inception to 14 January 2021 with no language restriction. Additionally, trial registries, grey literature databases and references lists will be searched. Studies related to lifestyle modification interventions on the adult population (>18 years) with learning disabilities will be eligible for inclusion. Two independent researchers will screen studies, extract data and assess its quality and risk of bias using the Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (RoB Version 2) and ROBINS-I. The strength of the body of evidence will be assessed based on the GRADE approach. The NMA will incorporate results from RCTs and quasi-experimental studies to estimate the effectiveness of various lifestyle interventions. Where appropriate, a component NMA (CNMA) will be used to estimate effectiveness. The realist synthesis will complement and explain the findings of NMA and CNMA by including additional qualitative and mixed-methods studies. Studies will be included based on their relevance to the programme theory and the rigour of their methods, as determined by quality appraisal tools appropriate to the study design. Results from both syntheses will be incorporated into a logic model. DISCUSSION The paucity of population-specific lifestyle interventions contributes to the challenges of behaviour change in adults with learning disabilities. This study will provide an evidence-base from which various stakeholders can develop effective interventions for adults with learning disabilities. The evidence will also help prioritise and inform research recommendations for future primary research so that people with learning disabilities live happier, healthier and longer lives.

We evaluated the effect of oral ribavirin on clinical outcomes of paramyxovirus infections in patients with hematological diseases. All adult patients with paramyxovirus were retrospectively reviewed over a 2-year period. Patients who received oral ribavirin were compared to those who received supportive care without ribavirin therapy. A propensity-matched case-control study and a logistic regression model with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) were performed to reduce the effect of selection bias in assignment for oral ribavirin therapy. A total of 145 patients, including 64 (44%) with PIV, 60 (41%) with RSV, and 21 (15%) with hMPV, were analyzed. Of these 145 patients, 114 (78%) received oral ribavirin and the remaining 31 (21%) constituted the nonribavirin group. Thirty-day mortality and underlying respiratory death rates were 31% (35/114) and 12% (14/114), respectively, for the oral ribavirin group versus 19% (6/31) and 16% (5/31), respectively, for the nonribavirin group (P = 0.21 and P = 0.56). In the case-control study, the 30-day mortality rate in the ribavirin group was 24% (5/21) versus 19% (4/21) in the nonribavirin group (P = 0.71). In addition, the logistic regression model with IPTW revealed no significant difference in 30-day mortality (adjusted hazard ratio of 1.3; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] of 0.3 to 5.8) between the two groups. Steroid use (adjusted odds ratio, 5.67; P = 0.01) and upper respiratory tract infection (adjusted odds ratio, 0.07; P = 0.001) was independently associated with mortality.

BACKGROUND DATA Although some studies investigated the efficacy of LAI of EDTA irrigation, no study has been conducted to investigate the efficacy of LAI of phytic acid in the removal of CH and TAP from root dentin. MATERIALS AND METHODS Root canals of extracted maxillary incisors (n = 80) were instrumented using rotary files and thereafter were split longitudinally. Following preparation of a standardized groove in the apical region of one root half, the roots were randomly divided into two groups according to the intracanal medicaments placed into the grooves: (1) CH and (2) TAP. The roots were reassembled, and the specimens were further assigned into four groups (n = 10/group) defined by the final irrigation solution (EDTA and phytic acid) and irrigation technique (needle irrigation and LAI) used for removal of the medicaments. The data were analyzed statistically using Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests. RESULTS For both EDTA and phytic acid, LAI was more efficient than needle irrigation in removing both CH and TAP (p < 0.05), but none of the tested techniques completely removed CH. Irrespective of the tested irrigation solutions and techniques, significantly less TAP remained in canals (p = 0.0001), with TAP being completely removed by LAI. Irrigation with phytic acid showed better removal efficacy than EDTA in the absence of statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS Er,Cr:YSGG LAI of EDTA and phytic acid completely removed TAP and effectively reduced CH on root dentin.","Eymirli, Ayhan; Nagas, Emre; Uyanik, Mehmet Ozgur; Cehreli, Zafer Cavit",Photomedicine and laser surgery,https://doi.org/10.1089/pho.2016.4146; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27623238/,354
102996,Survey of delivery room resuscitation practices at tertiary perinatal centers in Japan.,2015,"COVID-19, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on the 11th of March 2020, leading to some form of lockdown across almost all countries of the world. The extent of the global pandemic due to COVID-19 has a significant impact on our lives that must be studied carefully to combat it. This study highlights the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown on crucial aspects of daily life globally, including; Food security, Global economy, Education, Tourism, hospitality, sports and leisure, Gender Relation, Domestic Violence/Abuse, Mental Health and Environmental air pollution through a systematic search of the literature. The COVID-19 global lockdown was initiated to stem the spread of the virus and 'flatten the curve' of the pandemic. However, the impact of the lockdown has had far-reaching effects in different strata of life, including; changes in the accessibility and structure of education delivery to students, food insecurity as a result of unavailability and fluctuation in prices, the depression of the global economy, increase in mental health challenges, wellbeing and quality of life amongst others. This review article highlights the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown across the globe. As the global lockdown is being lifted in a phased manner in various countries of the world, it is necessary to explore its impacts to understand its consequences comprehensively. This will guide future decisions that will be made in a possible future wave of the COVID-19 pandemic or other global disease outbreak.","Onyeaka, Helen; Anumudu, Christian K; Al-Sharify, Zainab T; Egele-Godswill, Esther; Mbaegbu, Paul",Science progress,https://doi.org/10.1177/00368504211019854; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34061685/,354
103432,Feedback to the central dogma: cytoplasmic mRNA decay and transcription are interdependent processes.,2019,"Introduction We investigated the possibilities and opportunities for using wearable devices that measure physical activity and physiometric signals in conjunction with ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data to improve the assessment and treatment of pain. Methods We considered studies with cross-sectional and longitudinal designs as well as interventional or observational studies correlating pain scores with measures derived from wearable devices. A search was also performed on studies that investigated physical activity and physiometric signals among patients with pain. Results Few studies have assessed the possibility of incorporating wearable devices as objective tools for contextualizing pain and physical function in free-living environments. Of the studies that have been conducted, most focus solely on physical activity and functional outcomes as measured by a wearable accelerometer. Several studies report promising correlations between pain scores and signals derived from wearable devices, objectively measured physical activity, and physical function. In addition, there is a known association between physiologic signals that can be measured by wearable devices and pain, though studies using wearable devices to measure these signals and associate them with pain in free-living environments are limited. Conclusion There exists a great opportunity to study the complex interplay between physiometric signals, physical function, and pain in a real-time fashion in free-living environments. The literature supports the hypothesis that wearable devices can be used to develop reproducible biosignals that correlate with pain. The combination of wearable devices and EMA will likely lead to the development of clinically meaningful endpoints that will transform how we understand and treat pain patients.","Leroux, Andrew; Rzasa-Lynn, Rachael; Crainiceanu, Ciprian; Sharma, Tushar",Digital biomarkers,https://doi.org/10.1159/000515576; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34056519/,354

104490,Influence of intravenous regional limb perfusion with amikacin sulfate on Staphylococcus aureus bioburden in distal limb wounds in horses.,2017,"OBJECTIVE Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) occurs in up to 25% of very low birth weight (VLBW) preterm neonates. Previous studies found that indomethacin administered in the first 6 h of life reduces the incidence of severe IVH in VLBW neonates and decreases cerebral blood flow, suggesting a decrease in cerebral oxygen delivery. Using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), we monitored cerebral oxygenation before, during and after slow indomethacin infusion in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) neonates to determine whether indomethacin decreases cerebral oxygen saturation and increases cerebral oxygen extraction. STUDY DESIGN Twenty-seven ELBW neonates less than 30 weeks gestational age treated with indomethacin for IVH prophylaxis were monitored for arterial oxygen saturation (SaO(2)) and NIRS-determined regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO(2)). At 30 to 60 s intervals, SaO(2), rSO(2) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were recorded using a VitalSync. Average fractional cerebral oxygen extraction was calculated for the hour before indomethacin infusion, during the infusion and 2 h after infusion. RESULT Fractional cerebral oxygen extraction increased from baseline after indomethacin administration from 0.23±0.11 to 0.25±0.10 (P=0.034). CONCLUSION Fractional cerebral oxygen extraction increased 9% with indomethacin 0.1 mg kg(-1) given over 1 to 2 h. However, the clinical implications of this small increase in extraction, likely representative of decreased cerebral perfusion, are unknown but may be harmful to the developing brain.","Garner, R S; Miller, C; Burchfield, D J",Journal of perinatology : official journal of the California Perinatal Association,https://doi.org/10.1038/jp.2011.175; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22222547/,354

107131,Challenges of Cellular Therapy During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2021,"It has been shown previously in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that two point mutations, N15A and V25F, in the transmembrane domain (TMD) of the envelope (E) protein abolished channel activity and led to in vivo attenuation. Pathogenicity was recovered in mutants that also regained E protein channel activity. In particular, V25F was rapidly compensated by changes at multiple V25F-facing TMD residues located on a neighboring monomer, consistent with a recovery of oligomerization. Here, we show using infected cells that the same mutations, T16A and A26F, in the gamma-CoV infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) lead to, in principle, similar results. However, IBV E A26F did not abolish oligomer formation and was compensated by mutations at N- and C-terminal extramembrane domains (EMDs). The C-terminal EMD mutations clustered along an insertion sequence specific to gamma-CoVs. Nuclear magnetic resonance data are consistent with the presence of only one TMD in IBV E, suggesting that recovery of channel activity and fitness in these IBV E revertant mutants is through an allosteric interaction between EMDs and TMD. The present results are important for the development of IBV live attenuated vaccines when channel-inactivating mutations are introduced in the E protein.IMPORTANCE The ion channel activity of SARS-CoV E protein is a determinant of virulence, and abolishment of channel activity leads to viral attenuation. E deletion may be a strategy for generating live attenuated vaccines but can trigger undesirable compensatory mechanisms through modifications of other viral proteins to regain virulence. Therefore, a more suitable approach may be to introduce small but critical attenuating mutations. For this, the stability of attenuating mutations should be examined to understand the mechanisms of reversion. Here, we show that channel-inactivating mutations of the avian infectious bronchitis virus E protein introduced in a recombinant virus system are deficient in viral release and fitness and that revertant mutations also restored channel activity. Unexpectedly, most of the revertant mutations appeared at extramembrane domains, particularly along an insertion specific for gammacoronaviruses. Our structural data propose a single transmembrane domain in IBV E, suggesting an allosteric interaction between extramembrane and transmembrane domains.","To, Janet; Surya, Wahyu; Fung, To Sing; Li, Yan; Verdià-Bàguena, Carmina; Queralt-Martin, Maria; Aguilella, Vicente M; Liu, Ding Xiang; Torres, Jaume",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02158-16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27974570/,354

DESIGN Retrospective study. SETTING University-affiliated hospital. POPULATION A total of 108 patients who underwent second-look laparoscopy after laparoscopic myomectomy without concomitant pelvic surgery between January 2006 and May 2010. METHODS Absorbable cellulose adhesion barriers were used for uterine repair at initial surgery in all women. The presence of adhesions was evaluated by second-look laparoscopy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The influence of background factors (diameter of largest myoma, number of myomas, incision sites and number of suture layers) and the uterine status immediately after uterine repair at laparoscopic myomectomy (number, length and location of wounds, as well as wound appearance classified as virtually normal, swollen or protruding) on adhesion formation were analysed in 108 women with 296 uterine wounds. Data were analysed by logistic regression analysis. RESULTS Forty-one (38.0%) women had adhesions to their uterus at follow up. We identified 48 (16.2%) adhesions among 296 wounds in all women. A protruding wound was significantly associated with postoperative wound adhesion (odds ratio, 2.53; p=0.02). The number of enucleated subserosal myomas (odds ratio, 3.29; p<0.001) and the diameter of the largest myoma (odds ratio, 1.05; p<0.001) were significantly associated with wound protrusion, which was a critical factor influencing adhesion. CONCLUSIONS Postoperative wound adhesion formation seems to depend on uterine status immediately after laparoscopic myomectomy.","Kumakiri, Jun; Kikuchi, Iwaho; Kitade, Mari; Matsuoka, Shozo; Kono, Ayako; Ozaki, Rie; Takeda, Satoru",Acta obstetricia et gynecologica Scandinavica,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0412.2011.01339.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22168781/,354

In the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, we assessed whether those trained through these programmes were involved in the COVID-19 response and if so, in which area(s) of the emergency response they were applying their skills. Methods: From the records for each training programme, we identified the individuals who had completed training during the relevant timespan of each programme: 1999-2018 for the CRDF scheme, 2015-2020 for PGTS, and 2009-2019 for SORT-IT. Between March and April 2020, we sent trainees an online questionnaire by e-mail. Results: Out of 1254 trained, 1143 could be contacted and 699 responded to the survey. Of the latter, 411 were involved with the COVID-19 response, of whom 315 (77%) were applying their acquired skills in 85 countries. With some overlap between programmes, 84% of those trained through CRDF were applying their skills in 27 countries, 91% of those trained through PGTS were applying their skills in 19 countries, and through SORT IT, this was 73% in 62 countries. Skills were being applied in various areas of the emergency response, including: emergency preparedness, situation analysis/surveillance, infection control and clinical management, data generation, mitigating the effect of COVID on the health system, and research. Depending on the type of training programme, 26-74% were involved in implementation, operational or clinical research. Conclusion: Research training programmes build research capacity and equip health workers with transferable core competencies and skillsets prior to epidemics. This becomes invaluable in building health system resilience at a time of pandemics.","Zachariah, Rony; Maher, Dermot; Aseffa, Abraham; Vahedi, Mahnaz; Launois, Pascal; Khogali, Mohammed; Aslanyan, Garry; Reeder, John C",F1000Research,https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.24192.2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32595962/,354

Vaccination prior to transplantation offers the best chance of developing immunity and may expand the pool of donor organs that candidates can accept without needing post-transplant therapy. Furthermore, transplant recipients are at greater risk for acquiring vaccine-preventable illnesses or succumbing to severe sequelae of such illnesses. However, a rising rate of vaccine refusal has challenged transplant centers to address the phenomenon of vaccine hesitancy. Transplant centers may need to consider adopting a policy of denial of solid organ transplantation on the basis of vaccine refusal for non-medical reasons (i.e., philosophical or religious objections or personal beliefs that vaccines are unnecessary or unsafe). Arguments supporting such a policy are motivated by utility, stewardship, and beneficence. Arguments opposing such a policy emphasize justice and respect for persons, and seek to avoid worsening inequities or medical coercion. This paper examines these arguments and situates them within the special cases of pediatric transplantation, emergent transplantation, and living donation. Ultimately, a uniform national policy addressing vaccine refusal among transplant candidates is needed to resolve this ethical dilemma and establish a consistent, fair, and standard approach to vaccine refusal in transplantation.","Kates, Olivia S; Stohs, Erica J; Pergam, Steven A; Rakita, Robert M; Michaels, Marian G; Wolfe, Cameron R; Danziger-Isakov, Lara; Ison, Michael G; Blumberg, Emily A; Razonable, Raymund R; Gordon, Elisa J; Diekema, Douglas S",American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.1111/ajt.16472; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33370501/,354

STUDY DESIGN Clinical and radiographic data were collected from records of 5 oral pathology laboratories, and all cases were microscopically reviewed. RESULTS This series of cases included 36 (34.2%) from South Africa; 33 (31.4%) from Brazil; 23 (21.9%) from Mexico; and 13 (12.3%) from Guatemala. Seventy-two patients (68.5%) were females and 33 patients (31.4%) were males, with an average age of 19.2 years. The tumors predominantly affected the anterior maxilla (48.5%), followed by the anterior mandible (29.5%); posterior mandible (15.2%); and posterior maxilla (6.6%). Sixty-three tumors (63.6%) were follicular, 34 (34.3%) were extrafollicular, and 2 (2%) were peripheral. In most cases, the tumors caused considerable cortical expansion (average size 3.4 cm). Microscopically, most cases showed rosette-like and duct-like structures.

Here, we report that M(pro)-C can reversibly interconvert between these two topological states under physiological conditions. Although the swapped α(1)-helix is fully buried inside the protein hydrophobic core, the interconversion of M(pro)-C is carried out without the hydrophobic core being exposed to solvent. The 3D domain swapping of M(pro)-C is activated by an order-to-disorder transition of its C-terminal α(5)-helix foldon. Unfolding of this foldon promotes self-association of M(pro)-C monomers and functions to mediate the 3D domain swapping, without which M(pro)-C can no longer form the domain-swapped dimer. Taken together, we propose that there exists a special dimeric intermediate enabling the protein core to unpack and the α(1)-helices to swap in a hydrophobic environment, which minimizes the energy cost of the 3D domain-swapping process.","Kang, Xue; Zhong, Nan; Zou, Peng; Zhang, Shengnan; Jin, Changwen; Xia, Bin",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1205241109; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22927388/,354

116576,COMPARISONS AMONG COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHIC FEATURES OF ADIPOSE MASSES IN DOGS AND CATS.,2017,"The beneficial role that animal shelters play is unquestionable. An estimated 3 to 4 million animals are cared for or placed in homes each year, and most shelters promote public health and support responsible pet ownership. It is, nonetheless, inevitable that shelters are prime examples of anthropogenic biological instability: even well-run shelters often house transient, displaced, and mixed populations of animals. Many of these animals have received minimal to no prior health care, and some have a history of scavenging or predation to survive. Overcrowding and poor shelter conditions further magnify these inherent risks to create individual, intraspecies, and interspecies stress and provide an environment conducive to exposure to numerous potentially collaborative pathogens. All of these factors can contribute to the evolution and emergence of new pathogens or to alterations in virulence of endemic pathogens. While it is not possible to effectively anticipate the timing or the pathogen type in emergence events, their sites of origin are less enigmatic, and pathologists and diagnosticians who work with sheltered animal populations have recognized several such events in the past decade. This article first considers the contribution of the shelter environment to canine and feline disease. This is followed by summaries of recent research on the pathogenesis of common shelter pathogens, as well as research that has led to the discovery of novel or emerging diseases and the methods that are used for their diagnosis and discovery. For the infectious agents that commonly affect sheltered dogs and cats, including canine distemper virus, canine influenza virus, Streptococcus spp, parvoviruses, feline herpesvirus, feline caliciviruses, and feline infectious peritonitis virus, we present familiar as well as newly recognized lesions associated with infection.

116913,Single incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy: for what benefit?,2013,"INTRODUCTION With the current COVID-19 pandemic, concerns have raised regarding the risk for NIV to promote airborne transmission. In case of hospital admission, continuation of therapy in patients undergoing chronic NIV is necessary and several protective circuit configurations have been recommended to reduce the risk of aerosol dissemination. However, all these configurations increase instrumental dead space. We therefore designed this study to evaluate their effects on the tidal volume (VTE) required to preserve stable end-tidal CO2 partial pressure (PETCO2) with constant respiratory rate. METHODS A bench consisting of a test lung connected to an adult-sized mannequin head was set up. The model was ventilated through usual domiciliary configuration (single limb circuit with facial vented mask) which was used as reference. Then, five different circuit configurations including non-vented facial mask with viral/bacterial filter, modification of leak position, and change from single to double-limb circuit were evaluated. For each configuration, pressure support (PS) was gradually increased to reach reference PETCO2. Resulting VTE was recorded as primary outcome. RESULTS Reference PETCO2 was 38(0)mmHg, with a PS set at 10cmH2O, resulting in a VTE of 432(2)mL. Compared to reference, all the configurations evaluated required substantial increase in VTE to preserve alveolar ventilation, ranging from +79(2) to +216(1)mL. CONCLUSIONS Modifications of NIV configurations in the context of COVID-19 pandemic result in substantial increase of instrumental dead space. Re-evaluation of treatment efficiency and settings is crucial whenever protective measures influencing NIV equipment are considered.","Delorme, Mathieu; Leroux, Karl; Boussaid, Ghilas; Lebret, Marius; Prigent, Helene; Leotard, Antoine; Louis, Bruno; Lofaso, Frédéric",Archivos de bronconeumologia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arbres.2021.01.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33678476/,354
117594,"The effectiveness of a dose based reporting tool in reducing vaccine wastage at primary care clinics in Delhi, India: an operational research study.",2020-08-24,"Background In the typical procedure for secondary correction of the inframammary fold (IMF) following breast reconstruction, a large incision is often required, and this increases surgical invasiveness. The ""drawstring method"" is a simple procedure for recreating a smooth IMF. We modified the drawstring method and developed an essentially scarless method for IMF correction from small stab incisions. Methods Patients at our hospital who presented with IMF ptosis or loss of definition after breast reconstruction and required IMF correction, as well as those who requested IMF recreation for the contralateral breast, during the period spanning May 2016 to June 2019 were considered for this study. We collected and analyzed demographic data, as well as complications and postoperative outcomes. Results The new method was performed on 20 patients, with the following breakdown: IMF recreation after breast reconstruction with a deep inferior epigastric artery perforator flap (11 patients), IMF recreation after breast reconstruction with a breast implant (2 patients), IMF recreation after breast reconstruction with fat graft (5 patients), and IMF recreation for the contralateral breast (2 patients). Overcorrection of the IMF stabilized by 2-3 months postoperatively, resulting in a smooth and well-defined IMF. For non-breast implant cases, the implant volume increased at the lower pole. Slack in the suture was observed in only 2 patients of the deep inferior epigastric artery perforator group and in 1 patient of the breast implant group after 6 months postoperatively. Conclusions Our new method allows for the recreation of an essentially scarless, smooth, and well-defined IMF. IMF definition can be adjusted by altering the depth of the barbed suture. Since this method can be performed under local anesthesia, it offers the benefits of reducing medical costs and physical burden on patients.","Tomita, Koichi; Taminato, Mifue; Nomori, Michiko; Maeda, Daisuke; Seike, Shien; Tashima, Hiroki; Yano, Kenji; Kubo, Tateki",Plastic and reconstructive surgery.

118510,Transvaginal specimen extraction after combined laparoscopic splenectomy and hysterectomy: Introduction to NOSE (Natural Orifice Specimen Extraction) in a community hospital.,2013,"Enzootic nasal tumor virus (ENTV) and Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV) are highly related ovine betaretroviruses that induce nasal and lung tumours in small ruminants, respectively. While the ENTV and JSRV envelope (Env) glycoproteins mediate virus entry using the same cellular receptor, the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked protein hyaluronoglucosaminidase, ENTV Env pseudovirions mediate entry into cells from a much more restricted range of species than do JSRV Env pseudovirions. Unlike JSRV Env, ENTV Env does not induce cell fusion at pH 5.0 or above, but rather requires a much lower pH (4.0-4.5) for fusion to occur. The cytoplasmic tail of retroviral envelope proteins is a key modulator of envelope-mediated fusion and pseudotype efficiency, especially in the context of virions composed of heterologous Gag proteins. Here we report that progressive truncation of the ENTV Env cytoplasmic tail improves transduction efficiency of pseudotyped retroviral vectors and that complete truncation of the ENTV Env cytoplasmic tail increases transduction efficiency to wild-type JSRV Env levels by increasing fusogenicity without affecting sensitivity to inhibition by lysosomotropic agents, subcellular localization or efficiency of inclusion into virions. Truncation of the cytoplasmic domain of ENTV Env resulted in a significant advantage in viral entry into all cell types tested, including foetal ovine lung and nasal cells. Taken together, we demonstrate that the cytoplasmic tail modulates the fusion activity of the ENTV Env protein and that truncation of this region enhances Eenv-mediated entry into target cells.","Walsh, Scott R; de Jong, Jondavid G; van Vloten, Jacob P; Gerpe, María Carla Rosales; Santry, Lisa A; Wootton, Sarah K",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/jgv.0.000654; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27902399/,354

METHODS Fifty-four patients (27 in each group) were randomized. A visual analog scale was used with a 10-point scale for an objective assessment of incisional pain and incisional cosmesis on postoperative days 1, 3, and 14. RESULTS The mean operating time was significantly longer in the SPLC. The mean cosmesis scores on postoperative days 3 (9.7 vs. 8.9, P = 0.01) and 14 (9.9 vs. 9.2, P<0.01) were significantly greater in the SPLC group than in the MPLC group. The group's mean visual analog scale scores for incisional pain, and their requirements for analgesics, did not differ significantly. CONCLUSIONS Although SPLC takes longer than MPLC, experienced laparoscopic surgeons can perform SPLC safely with results comparable with those for MPLC. SPLC is superior to MPLC in terms of short-term cosmetic outcomes.","Sasaki, Akira; Ogawa, Masaaki; Tono, Chihiro; Obara, Shin; Hosoi, Nobuyuki; Wakabayashi, Go","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",https://doi.org/10.1097/sle.0b013e3182631a9a; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23047380/,354
119205,Single-Center Experience With Lutonix Drug-Coated Balloons in Infrapopliteal Arteries.,2016,"An effective vaccine for hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major unmet need, and it requires an antigen that elicits immune responses to key conserved epitopes. Based on structures of antibodies targeting HCV envelope glycoprotein E2, we designed immunogens to modulate the structure and dynamics of E2 and favor induction of bNAbs in the context of a vaccine. These designs include a point mutation in a key conserved antigenic site to stabilize its conformation, as well as redesigns of an immunogenic region to add a new N-glycosylation site and mask it from antibody binding. Designs were experimentally characterized for binding to a panel of human monoclonal antibodies (HMAbs) and the coreceptor CD81 to confirm preservation of epitope structure and preferred antigenicity profile. Selected E2 designs were tested for immunogenicity in mice, with and without hypervariable region 1, which is an immunogenic region associated with viral escape. One of these designs showed improvement in polyclonal immune serum binding to HCV pseudoparticles and neutralization of isolates associated with antibody resistance. These results indicate that antigen optimization through structure-based design of the envelope glycoproteins is a promising route to an effective vaccine for HCV.IMPORTANCE Hepatitis C virus infects approximately 1% of the world's population, and no vaccine is currently available. Due to the high variability of HCV and its ability to actively escape the immune response, a goal of HCV vaccine design is to induce neutralizing antibodies that target conserved epitopes. Here we performed structure-based design of several epitopes of the HCV E2 envelope glycoprotein to engineer its antigenic properties. Designs were tested in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating alteration of the E2 antigenic profile in several cases, and one design led to improvement of cross-neutralization of heterologous viruses. This represents a proof of concept that rational engineering of HCV envelope glycoproteins can be used to modulate E2 antigenicity and optimize a vaccine for this challenging viral target.","Pierce, Brian G; Keck, Zhen-Yong; Wang, Ruixue; Lau, Patrick; Garagusi, Kyle; Elkholy, Khadija; Toth, Eric A; Urbanowicz, Richard A; Guest, Johnathan D; Agnihotri, Pragati; Kerzic, Melissa C; Marin, Alexander; Andrianov, Alexander K; Ball, Jonathan K; Mariuzza, Roy A; Fuerst, Thomas R; Foung, Steven K H",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00704-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32878891/,354

119318,2013 AAFP Feline Vaccination Advisory Panel Report.,2013,"Considering the prevailing wave of global warming and other environmental challenges, which can be attributed to increasing environmental pollution as a result of economic activity, thus, it is essential to understand the effect of economic progress on the environment. More importantly, this endeavor is especially suited for the European Union (EU) member states, which account for a sizable portion of the world economy. However, by considering the open border or trade policy approach of the bloc, this study applies a battery of econometrics analysis that consists of mean group, augmented mean group, common correlated effect mean group estimators, and Dumitrescu and Hurlin causality analysis for direction of causality. These techniques are superior to first-generation methods to substantiate the relationship between real income, energy intensity, and carbon emission between annual frequency data from 1990 to 2017. Empirical results from series of cointegration tests reveal the long-run equilibrium relationship between the highlighted variables in the EU. Our study validates the existence of EKC phenomenon where emphasis is based on GDP growth at the expense of environmental quality. This implies that EU growth trajectory comes with an environmental trade-off and consequences. However, few countries in the region have made substantial strides of carbon reduction but not as a bloc. This position is resonated by the regression from all estimators in harmony where energy intensity dampens environmental quality in the blocs investigated. On the direction of causality, feedback Granger causality is observed running from GDP growth and carbon emission. A similar direction of causality is seen between energy intensity and carbon emission. These outcomes have far-reaching consequences on the environment. This study recommends the need for energy transition to cleaner and friendlier energy technologies by EU officials. That is, the need for a paradigm shift from conventional energy based on fossil fuel to renewable energy should be pursued in the region. More policy directions are outlined in the concluding section.","Bekun, Festus Victor; Alola, Andrew Adewale; Gyamfi, Bright Akwasi; Yaw, Sarpong Steve",Environmental science and pollution research international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-14251-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33974207/,354

We sought to document the routine early postoperative MR imaging findings following flow-diverting stent insertion. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients requiring flow-diverting stent placement for treatment or retreatment of cerebral aneurysms were prospectively included in the study during a 26-month period. Early postprocedural MR imaging studies were obtained and compared with preoperative imaging. Patient clinical outcome data were also collected. RESULTS There were 34 stent-placement procedures during the study period. Aneurysm mural enhancement and mild new perianeurysmal edema were present in 50% and 14%, respectively. Any DWI lesion was present in 57% of cases. New or possibly new foci of susceptibility effect were found ipsilateral to the stent and not associated with diffusion restriction in 66% of cases. There were 2 cases (6%) of parenchymal hemorrhage and 2 major clinical complications (6%) causing permanent morbidity. CONCLUSIONS Asymptomatic aneurysm mural enhancement is frequently seen following flow-diverting stent placement and should not necessarily be interpreted as a sign of impending aneurysm rupture. This finding often persists despite complete aneurysm occlusion. New small brain parenchymal susceptibility foci following stent placement have not previously been reported, to our knowledge, but were common in our series.","McGuinness, B J; Memon, S; Hope, J K",AJNR.

The Disease Transmission Advisory Committee (DTAC) evaluated 105 cases of potential donor derived transmission events (PDDTE) of HBV between 2009-2017. Proven, probable or possible transmission of HBV occurred in 25 (23.8%) cases. Recipients of liver grafts were most commonly infected (20 of 21 exposed recipients) compared to 9 of 21 exposed non-hepatic recipients. Eleven of 25 donors were HBV core antibody (HBcAb) positive/HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) negative and infected 8/20 recipients. Of the 10 liver recipients and 1 liver-kidney recipient who received organs from these donors: 6 were not given antiviral prophylaxis, 2 developed infection after antiviral prophylaxis was discontinued, 2 developed HBV while on lamivudine prophylaxis, 1 was on antiviral prophylaxis and did not develop HBV viremia or antigenemia. One recipient of a HBcAb positive/HBsAg negative kidney developed active HBV infection. Unexpected donor-derived transmission of HBV was a rare event in reports to DTAC, but was often detected in the recipient late post-transplant.

However, there are no reports regarding the relationship between 18F-FDG uptake and outcomes after radiofrequency ablation (RFA). A prospective cohort study was conducted to evaluate the prognostic value of 18F-FDG positron emission tomography (PET) in HCC patients after RFA. METHODS A total of 121 consecutive patients with primary HCC (≤3 tumors, of diameter ≤ 3 cm) without vascular invasion on imaging were examined by 18F-FDG-PET computed tomography prior to RFA. An HCC with a component of 18F-FDG uptake visibly stronger than that of surrounding liver was defined as 18F-FDG-PET positive. RESULTS The median follow-up period was 1267 days. There were 110 18F-FDG-PET negative and 11 positive tumors. The cumulative 1-year recurrence rates in the 18F-FDG negative and positive groups were 30 and 64% (P = 0.017), respectively, and cumulative 1-year metastatic recurrence rates were 6 and 36% (P < 0.001), respectively. The cumulative 5-year survival rates were 88 and 22% (P < 0.001), respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed 18F-FDG-PET positivity and tumor size as independent factors related to metastatic recurrence and survival after RFA. CONCLUSIONS 18F-FDG-PET positivity was significantly associated with outcomes after RFA. RFA should not be readily selected as the first-line treatment for small HCC that includes a component of visually strong 18F-FDG uptake.","Ida, Yoshiyuki; Tamai, Hideyuki; Shingaki, Naoki; Shimizu, Ryo; Maeshima, Shuya; Maekita, Takao; Iguchi, Mikitaka; Terada, Masaki; Kitano, Masayuki",Cancer imaging : the official publication of the International Cancer Imaging Society,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40644-020-00356-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33076990/,354

Hispanic/Latino men who have sex with men (MSM) accounted for 24% (138,023) of U.S. MSM living with diagnosed HIV infection at the end of 2018 (1). Antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence is crucial for viral suppression, which improves health outcomes and prevents HIV transmission (2). Barriers to ART adherence among Hispanic/Latino MSM have been explored in limited contexts (3); however, nationally representative analyses are lacking. The Medical Monitoring Project reports nationally representative estimates of behavioral and clinical experiences of U.S. adults with diagnosed HIV infection. This analysis used Medical Monitoring Project data collected during 2015-2019 to examine ART adherence and reasons for missing ART doses among HIV-positive Hispanic/Latino MSM (1,673). On a three-item ART adherence scale with 100 being perfect adherence, 77.3% had a score of ≥85. Younger age, poverty, recent drug use, depression, and unmet needs for ancillary services were predictors of lower ART adherence. The most common reason for missing an ART dose was forgetting; 63.9% of persons who missed ≥1 dose reported more than one reason. Interventions that support ART adherence and access to ancillary services among Hispanic/Latino MSM might help improve clinical outcomes and reduce transmission.","Crim, Stacy M; Tie, Yunfeng; Beer, Linda; Weiser, John; Dasgupta, Sharoda",MMWR.

The aim of this systematic review was to provide an overview and critically evaluate the current evidence on the efficacy and safety of probiotic, prebiotic, synbiotic, and fecal microbiota transplantation therapies for core and co-occurring behavioral symptoms in individuals with ASD. Comprehensive searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science Core Collection, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar were performed from inception to March 5, 2020, and two update searches were completed on October 25, 2020, and April 22, 2021, respectively. A total of 4306 publications were identified, of which 14 articles met the inclusion criteria. Data were extracted independently by two reviewers using a preconstructed form. Results of probiotic studies do not confirm the supposed beneficial effect of probiotics on ASD, whereas prebiotics and synbiotic combinations appear to be efficacious in selective behavioral symptoms. Evidence of the efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation in ASD is still scarce but supports further research. Overall, the current evidence base to suggest beneficial effects of these modalities in ASD is limited and inconclusive. More clinical trials are currently looking at the use of microbial-based therapies in ASD. With a robust double-blind randomized controlled protocol to investigate the efficacy, these trials should provide significant and definitive results. LAY SUMMARY: There is a link between altered gut bacteria and autism spectrum disorder. Some people believe that modulating bacterial composition in the gut may help reduce autism symptoms, but evidence from human studies suggesting beneficial effects of probiotic, prebiotic, and combination thereof as well as fecal transplants in autism spectrum disorder is limited and inconclusive. Current data should not encourage use of these modalities. Further clinical studies are needed.","Tan, Qiming; Orsso, Camila E; Deehan, Edward C; Kung, Janice Y; Tun, Hein M; Wine, Eytan; Madsen, Karen L; Zwaigenbaum, Lonnie; Haqq, Andrea M",Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research,https://doi.org/10.1002/aur.2560; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34173726/,354

METHODS We evaluated the CRP values in 103 patients undergoing primary TKA. Serum CRP was measured on the day before surgery, and on the third and twenty-first days after the procedure. RESULTS PCR showed sudden increase on the third day after surgery, reaching the mean value of 111.9 mg/L, median 75.9 mg/L. Only one-third of the patients returned to normal levels in the third week. In the immediate postoperative period, CRP was not correlated with body mass index (BMI), age, gender, blood transfusion, or complications. CONCLUSION Serum CRP remains high in the third week after TKA in most patients, and this change is primarily related to surgical trauma.","Barretto, João Maurício; Loures, Fabrício Bolpato; Albuquerque, Rodrigo Sattamini Pires E; Bezerra, Filipe das Neves; Faro, Rafael Vinagre; Cavanellas, Naasson Trindade",Revista brasileira de ortopedia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rboe.2016.05.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28409135/,354

128652,Inflammatory joint disease in cats: diagnostic approach and treatment.,2014,"Climate change is the variability of the climate system that includes the atmosphere, the biogeochemical cycles (Carbon cycle, Nitrogen cycle and Hydrological cycle), the land surface, ice and the biotic and abiotic components of the planet earth. Significant impact of climate change is seen in the form of rise in temperature called as global warming. Carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) are the primary greenhouse gases (GHGs) mainly responsible for the global warming and climate change. These GHGs have drawn lot of attention due to their significant role in the global warming potential. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggested to stop global warming at 1.5oC above preindustrial levels as warming beyond this level might lead to heat extremes, alter insect and plant phenology (Phenological shifts) and more occurrence of vector borne diseases. Climate change is the topic of interest in all fields of life starting from social science and going to the applied science. Global climate cycles and world food production systems are under threat due to the recent climate extreme events. These events include heat waves and change in the rainfall patterns. Thus, risk reduction intervention in the form of mitigation and adaptation is required to minimize the impacts of climate change. Mitigation option includes understanding the present and future components of the climate system and interaction among them through coupled modeling system i.e. Global Circulation Model (GCM). Finally, global issue of climate change could be addressed by taking worldwide cooperation and action and adopting sustainable measures like use of alternative energy sources. The visible benefit on recovery of climate has been seen recently through global lockdown against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.","Ahmed, Mukhtar",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139397; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32470658/,354
128833,Seroprevalence of Coxiella burnetii in domesticated and feral cats in eastern Australia.,2015,"OBJECTIVES To investigate the feasibility of molecular beacons (MBs) for screening urine samples from patients with suspected bladder cancer. Our previous study showed that MBs could detect bladder cancer cells and cells shed in the urine from patients with bladder cancer. METHODS Samples from 35 patients with bladder cancer and 35 healthy adults were initially evaluated. Cyanine 3-labeled MBs linked to a survivin mRNA probe were used to detect exfoliative cells in urine. Exfoliative cytology, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and Western blotting of the tissues were used to confirm the MB results. We then evaluated the urine samples from 187 patients with suspected bladder cancer. All 187 patients also underwent cystoscopy. RESULTS In the initial cohort evaluated, MBs detected cancerous cells in 28 (80%) of the 35 patients with confirmed bladder cancer. Survivin protein was detected by Western blotting in 25 (71.4%) of the 35 patients. The sensitivity and specificity of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was 54.3% (20 of 35) and 68.6% (24 of 35), respectively. In a large group of patients with suspected bladder cancer, the sensitivity of MBs was 77.3% (85 of 110) and the specificity was 76.6% (59 of 77) compared with the cystoscopy data. Differences in the protein levels between the tumor grades and stages were not significant. CONCLUSIONS Our results have demonstrated that it is feasible to detect survivin mRNA in the exfoliated cells in urine using MBs. With further development, MBs could be used in a noninvasive clinical diagnostic procedure for the early detection of bladder cancer and postoperative follow-up.","Zhao, Jun; Wang, Zhi-Qiang; Wang, Xin-Yang; Yang, Xiao-Jie; He, Dalin",Urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.urology.2010.04.023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20579701/,354

There are two major elements to immunity that are necessary to model: primary immune tissues and peripheral tissues with immune components. Here, we systematically review progress made along three strategies to modeling immunity: ex vivo cultures, which preserve native tissue structure; microfluidic devices, which constitute a versatile approach to providing physiologically relevant fluid flow and environmental control; and engineered tissues, which provide precise control of the 3D microenvironment and biophysical cues. While many models focus on disease modeling, more primary immune tissue models are necessary to advance the field. Moving forward, we anticipate that the expansion of patient-specific models may inform why immunity varies from patient to patient and allow for the rapid comprehension and treatment of emerging diseases, such as coronavirus disease 2019.

The results indicate the division of isolates into two different genotypes of IBV within the province, Massachusetts (Mass)-like and QX-like. The IBV Mass-like genotype was the most prevalent and was detected in 79% of the full spike protein S1 gene sequences. Variation up to 22.3% was detected within local Mass-type strains, supporting the hypothesis that multiple IBV serotypes may co-circulate in the same region simultaneously. Additionally, more conservation was observed amongst Mass serotypes versus QX-like serotypes, implying that vaccine use can influence the variability within the IBV population; this is deduced from the fact that the only live vaccine registered for use in South Africa at the time of the study was of Mass origin and no QX-like vaccines were available for use. This study offers the first published consolidation of IBV isolates from an area of South Africa and identifies variation within the IBV population of the broiler flock within the study area over a 2-year period.","Knoetze, Adrian D; Moodley, Niloshni; Abolnik, Celia",The Onderstepoort journal of veterinary research,https://doi.org/10.4102/ojvr.v81i1.769; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25685887/,354

BACKGROUND Optic neuritis is a common presenting feature of both NMO and MS. Distinguishing between NMO and RRMS is important in guiding treatment, but biomarkers of NMO and MS can be absent early in the disease process. We looked for differences in MRI characteristics of optic neuritis associated with NMO and MS that provide an early clue in the diagnostic workup. DESIGN/METHODS We conducted a retrospective analysis of 26 NMO and 26 RRMS patients presenting to the Johns Hopkins Hospital with MRI-confirmed acute optic neuritis. Magnetic resonance images were assessed to identify the location and longitudinal extent of each contrast enhancing lesion. For the purposes of this study, the optic nerve was divided into intraorbital, canalicular, prechiasmal, chiasmal, and optic tract. RESULTS There are distinct differences in MRI characteristics between NMO-associated and RRMS-associated optic neuritis. The majority of NMO lesions were longitudinally extensive measuring at least 17.6 mm in length and involving at least 3 optic nerve segments. At a cut-off of 17.6 mm of lesion length, the specificity for NMO is 76.9% with a sensitivity of 80.8% and a positive likelihood ratio of 3.50. Conversely, MS lesions were more commonly focal in 1 optic nerve segment localized anteriorly. CONCLUSIONS Optic neuritis in NMO has a distinct pattern on MRI as compared with RRMS and can help differentiate these 2 neuroinflammatory diseases at presentation.",,Journal of neuro-ophthalmology : the official journal of the North American Neuro-Ophthalmology Society,https://doi.org/10.1097/wno.0000000000000319; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26576022/,354

130588,Uniportal video assisted thoracic surgery with 2 cm skin incision for right middle lobectomy with systematic lymphadenectomy.,2017,"INTRODUCTION CO2 pneumoperitoneum has been used to establish an operation space in laparoscopic surgery. It may have some bad consequences, such as respiratory and circulatory system changes, hypotension and hypoxia in infants and the release of free tumor cells into the abdominal cavity. Gasless laparoscopic technique can avoid these adverse effects. But present gasless laparoscopic techniques have their own disadvantages. The main shortcoming of gasless laparoscopic techniques is inadequate operative space. MATERIAL AND METHODS We herein describe a new technique. We used a self-designed spindle-like abdominal wall-lifting device to perform gasless laparoscopic cholecystectomy in seven pigs, recording the operation time, bleeding volume and unexpected occurrences during the operation. RESULTS Seven pigs underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy using this technique with no conversion to open operation. The operation time was between 21 minutes and 65 minutes, with a mean operative time of 42.5 minutes. The range of bleeding volumes was 2 ml to 8 ml, with a mean operative bleeding volume of 4.3 ml. There were no massive hemorrhages, internal organ injuries or other complications during the operation. CONCLUSIONS These preliminary outcomes indicate that the spindle-like abdominal wall-lifting device is feasible and safe in gasless laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which can provide sufficient exposure of the operative filed.","Wu, Dongbo; Geng, Kuihua; Feng, Zerong; Shao, Xinhua; Qin, Sujiao; Chen, Xiang; Zheng, Guangping; Yang, Shengfu",Minimally invasive therapy & allied technologies : MITAT : official journal of the Society for Minimally Invasive Therapy,https://doi.org/10.3109/13645706.2014.900508; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25308716/,354

METHODS Fourteen young men were tested for 1-repetition maximum (1RM) in the barbell biceps curl and lying triceps extension exercises. On separate visits, subjects performed exercise trials (4 sets to failure at 70% 1RM with 90 s between sets) in six separate randomized conditions, i.e., in normoxia or hypoxia (fraction of inspired oxygen = 20.9% and 12.9%, respectively) combined with three different levels of BFR (0%, 45%, or 60% of resting arterial occlusion pressure). Muscle activation and oxygenation were monitored via surface electromyography and near-infrared spectroscopy, respectively. Arterial oxygen saturation, heart rate, and perceptual responses were assessed following each set. RESULTS Compared to set 1, the number of repetitions before failure decreased in sets 2, 3, and 4 for both exercises (all P < 0.001), independently of the condition (P > 0.065). Arterial oxygen saturation was lower with systemic hypoxia (P < 0.001), but not BFR, while heart rate did not differ between conditions (P > 0.341). Muscle oxygenation and activation during exercise trials remained unaffected by the different conditions (all P ≥ 0.206). A significant main effect of time, but not condition, was observed for overall perceived discomfort, difficulty breathing, and limb discomfort (all P < 0.001). CONCLUSION Local and systemic hypoxic stimuli, or a combination of both, did not modify the fatigue-induced change in performance, trends of muscle activation or oxygenation, nor exercise-related sensations during a multi-set resistance exercise to task failure.","Girard, Olivier; Willis, Sarah J; Purnelle, Marin; Scott, Brendan R; Millet, Grégoire P",European journal of applied physiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00421-019-04217-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31468172/,354

132751,Equine disease surveillance: quarterly update.,2019-11-30,"PURPOSE Humanitarianism is by definition a moral of kindness, benevolence and sympathy extended to all human beings. In our view as surgeons working in underserved countries, humanitarianism means performing the best operation in the best possible circumstances with high income country (HIC) results and training in-country surgeons to do the same. Hernia Repair for the Underserved (HRFU), a not for profit organization, is developing a long term public health initiative for hernia surgery in Western Hemisphere countries. We report the progress of HRFUs methods to render humanitarian care. METHODS In a collaborative effort, Creighton University and the Institute for Latin American Concern developed an outpatient surgery site for hernia surgery in Santiago, Dominican Republic. Based on this experience, we developed a sustainable care model by recruiting American and European Hernia Society expert surgeons, staff members they recommended, building relationships with local and industry partners, and selecting local surgeons to be trained in mesh hernioplasty. HRFU then extended the care model to other Western Hemisphere countries. RESULTS Between 2004 and 2015, the HRFU elective hernia morbidity and mortality rates for 2052 hernia operations were 0.7 and 0%, respectively. This is consistent with outcomes from HICs and confirms the feasibility of a public health initiative based on the principles of the Preferential Option for the Poor. CONCLUSIONS HRFU has recorded HIC morbidity and mortality rates for hernia surgery in low and middle income countries and has initiated a new surgical training model for sustainability of effect.","Schroeder, A D; Campanelli, G; Cavalli, M; Cusick, R; Fitzgibbons, R; Gilbert, A; Lawson, C; Manion, J; Matthews, B; Reinpold, W; Roll, S; Telemaque, L-F; Wagner, J P; Chen, D C; Filipi, C J",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-017-1665-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28887764/,354
132865,qPCR Validation on the Basis of the Listeria monocytogenes prfA Assay.,2021,"The demographic factors of sex, age, and race/ethnicity are well recognized as relevant to pain sensitivity and clinical pain expression. Of these, sex differences have been the most frequently studied, and most of the literature describes greater pain sensitivity for women. The other 2 factors have been less frequently evaluated, and current literature is not definitive. Taking advantage of the large Orofacial Pain: Prospective Evaluation and Risk Assessment (OPPERA) study cohort, we evaluated the association of sex, age, and self-reported race with 34 measures of pressure, mechanical, and thermal pain sensitivity encompassing threshold and suprathreshold perception. Women were significantly more pain-sensitive than men for 29 of 34 measures. Age effects were small, and only significant for 7 of 34 measures, however, the age range was limited (18-44 years of age). Race/ethnicity differences varied across groups and pain assessment type. Non-Hispanic white individuals were less pain-sensitive than African-American (for 21 of 34 measures), Hispanic (19 of 34), and Asian (6 of 34) individuals. No pain threshold measure showed significant racial differences, whereas several suprathreshold pain measures did. This suggests that racial differences are not related to tissue characteristics or inherent nociceptor sensitivity. Rather, the differences observed for suprathreshold pain ratings or tolerance are more likely related to differences in central nociceptive processing, including modulation imposed by cognitive, psychological, and/or affective factors. PERSPECTIVE The influence of sex, age, and race/ethnicity on various aspects of pain sensitivity, encompassing threshold and suprathreshold measures and multiple stimulus modalities, allows for a more complete evaluation of the relevance of these demographic factors to acute pain perception.","Ostrom, Cara; Bair, Eric; Maixner, William; Dubner, Ronald; Fillingim, Roger B; Ohrbach, Richard; Slade, Gary D; Greenspan, Joel D",The journal of pain : official journal of the American Pain Society,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpain.2016.10.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27884689/,354

Other countries have increased ABPM access by making it available in community pharmacies. It is not known if a similar approach is feasible in the United States. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate the feasibility of a community pharmacy-driven ABPM service in the United States. SETTING Two independent community pharmacies. PRACTICE DESCRIPTION The ABPM service was developed through a collaboration between an academic partner and the clinical service leads of each pharmacy. Eligible patients were those referred by their provider or self-referred for white coat, masked, or sustained hypertension (HTN), symptoms of hypotension, or requiring confirmation of an initial diagnosis of HTN. The service was appointment-based, and the pharmacist sent the ABPM results and interpretation to the referring provider via facsimile. PRACTICE INNOVATION This is the first description of a community pharmacy-driven ABPM service in the United States. EVALUATION Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data for the baseline demographics, ABPM findings, and a 9-question patient satisfaction survey. RESULTS A total of 52 patients with a mean (SD) age of 56.6 (16.1) years, 50% women, 75% white, and 71.2% with a prior diagnosis of HTN were enrolled. Forty-six patients (88.5%) had successful ABPM readings with the most common blood pressure phenotypes being nocturnal HTN (91.3%), nondipper (52.1%), sustained HTN (41.3%), normotensive (23.9%), and white coat HTN (19.6%). Overall, 88% of the patients strongly agreed or agreed that they were very satisfied with their experience using the ABPM service. CONCLUSION A community pharmacy-driven ABPM service is feasible in the United States and may be one approach to improve access to ABPM.","Dixon, Dave L; Patterson, Julie A; Gatewood, Sharon; Kaefer, Tana; Jadallah, Joseph; Curtis, Mary; Hawkey, Lisa; Grigsby, Jewlyus; Salgado, Teresa M; Holdford, David A",Journal of the American Pharmacists Association : JAPhA,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.japh.2020.06.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32665096/,354

Chalcones are natural open chain flavonoids that are found in various plants and can be synthesized in labs. Several studies have shown that these small organic molecules exert a number of pharmacological activities, including antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial and anticancer. The purpose of this review is to provide a summary of the antiviral activities of chalcones and their derivatives on a set of human viral infections and their potential for targeting the most recent COVID-19 disease. Accordingly, we herein review chalcones activities on the following human viruses: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, human immunodeficiency, influenza, human rhinovirus, herpes simplex, dengue, human cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B & C, rift valley fever and Venezuelan equine encephalitis.

134340,"Butcherbird polyomavirus isolated from a grey butcherbird (Cracticus torquatus) in Queensland, Australia.",2014,"BACKGROUND Cannabidiol (CBD) is a primary component in the cannabis plant; however, in recent years, interest in CBD treatments has outpaced scientific research and regulatory advancement resulting in a confusing landscape of misinformation and unsubstantiated health claims. Within the limited results from randomized controlled trials, and lack of trust in product quality and known clinical guidelines and dosages, real-world evidence (RWE) from countries with robust regulatory frameworks may fill a critical need for patients and healthcare professionals. Despite growing evidence and interest, no real-world data (RWD) studies have yet investigated patients' reports of CBD impact on symptom control in the common expression of pain, anxiety, depression, and poor wellbeing. The objective of this study is to assess the impact of CBD-rich treatment on symptom burden, as measured with a specific symptom assessment scale (ESAS-r). METHODS This retrospective observational study examined pain, anxiety, depression symptoms, and wellbeing in 279 participants over 18 years old, prescribed with CBD-rich treatment at a network of clinics dedicated to medical cannabis in Quebec, Canada. Data were collected at baseline, 3 (FUP1), and 6 (FUP2) month after treatment initiation. Groups were formed based on symptom severity (mild vs moderate/severe) and based on changes to treatment plan at FUP1 (CBD vs THC:CBD). Two-way mixed ANOVAs were used to assess ESAS-r scores differences between groups and between visits. RESULTS All average ESAS-r scores decreased between baseline and FUP1 (all ps < 0.003). The addition of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) during the first follow-up had no effect on symptom changes. Patients with moderate/severe symptoms experienced important improvement at FUP1 (all ps < 0.001), whereas scores on pain, anxiety, and wellbeing of those with mild symptoms actually increased. Differences in ESAS-r scores between FUP1 and FUP2 were not statistically different. CONCLUSION This retrospective observational study suggests CBD-rich treatment has a beneficial impact on pain, anxiety, and depression symptoms as well as overall wellbeing only for patients with moderate to severe symptoms; however, no observed effect on mild symptoms. The results of this study contribute to address the myths and misinformation about CBD treatment and demand further investigation.","Rapin, Lucile; Gamaoun, Rihab; El Hage, Cynthia; Arboleda, Maria Fernanda; Prosk, Erin",Journal of cannabis research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s42238-021-00078-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34162446/,354

Self-expandable metal stent (SEMS) placement in MLBO is a new decompression treatment in Japan. Preoperative stent placement (bridge to surgery: BTS) avoids emergency surgery, but oncological influences of stent placement and post-BTS surgical approach remain unclear. We examined short- and long-term results of surgery for MLBO after SEMS placement in our hospital. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 75 patients with MLBO who underwent resection after SEMS placement at our hospital from June 2013 to December 2018. Postoperative morbidity and mortality were evaluated by comparison with the surgical approach. RESULTS Tumor location was significantly higher in the left-side colon and rectum (n = 59, 78.7%) than right-side colon (n = 16, 21.3%). Technical and clinical success rates for SEMS placement were 97.3% and 96.0%, respectively. Laparoscopic surgery was performed in 54 patients (69.0%), and one-stage anastomosis was performed in 73 (97.3%). Postoperative complications were similar in the open surgery (open) group (n = 5, 23.8%) and laparoscopic surgery (lap) group (n = 7, 13.0%), with no severe complications requiring reoperation. Three-year overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) rates were not significantly different in the lap vs open group (67.5% vs 66.4%; 82.2% vs 62.5%). CONCLUSION Preoperative stent treatment avoids stoma construction but allows anastomosis. One-time surgery was performed safely contributing to minimally invasive treatment and acceptable short- and long-term results.","Tajima, Jesse Yu; Matsuhashi, Nobuhisa; Takahashi, Takao; Mizutani, Chika; Iwata, Yoshinori; Kiyama, Shigeru; Kubota, Masaya; Ibuka, Takashi; Araki, Hiroshi; Shimizu, Masahito; Doi, Kiyoshi; Yoshida, Kazuhiro",World journal of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12957-020-02039-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33050929/,354

Only 17 (17%) of the 100 participants experienced a severe asthma exacerbation. Moreover, there was no confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 in this population.Conclusion: Patients with severe asthma did not show higher rates of exacerbations during the pandemic outbreak as well as no increased risk of contracting COVID-19 infection or developing the disease. Self-administration of biological drugs could be useful to maintain high rates of adherence to therapy, and, at the same time, to decrease the risk of exacerbations or Intensive Care Unit (ICU) room access.","Caruso, Cristiano; Colantuono, Stefania; Urbani, Sara; Heffler, Enrico; Canonica, Giorgio Walter; Andriollo, Gloria; Di Michele, Loreta; Scarlata, Simone; Zennaro, Danila; Rigon, Amelia; Vadacca, Marta; Moroni, Rossana; Nucera, Eleonora; Gasbarrini, Antonio",Expert review of respiratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/17476348.2021.1917387; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33896350/,354

138991,Comparative study of talc poudrage versus pleural abrasion for the treatment of primary spontaneous pneumothorax.,2012,"PURPOSE After a long period of low utilization, droperidol has become easier to obtain in the US market. This comprehensive review discusses the safety, indications, clinical efficacy, and dosing of droperidol for use in the emergency department (ED) setting. SUMMARY In 2001 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) mandated a boxed warning in the labeling of droperidol after reports of QT interval prolongation associated with droperidol use. Since that time, it has been difficult to access droperidol in the United States; as a result, many practicing clinicians lack experience in its clinical use. Multiple studies have been conducted to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of droperidol use in ED patients. Results consistently show the safety of droperidol and its clinical efficacy when used as an analgesic, antiemetic, and sedative. Now that droperidol is more widely available for use in the US market, pharmacists and prescribers need to reliably translate safety and efficacy data compiled since 2001 to help ensure appropriate and effective use of the medication. CONCLUSION Droperidol is an effective and safe option for the treatment of acute agitation, migraine, nausea, and pain for patients in the ED setting. Healthcare professionals can adopt droperidol for use in clinical practice, and they should become familiar with how to dose and monitor droperidol for safe and effective use.","Mattson, Alicia; Friend, Kimberly; Brown, Caitlin S; Cabrera, Daniel",American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists,https://doi.org/10.1093/ajhp/zxaa271; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839811/,354

Lack of specific therapeutics and limited treatment options against COVID-19 has become a new challenge to identify potential hits in order to develop new therapeutics. One of the crucial life cycle enzymes of SARS-CoV-2 is main protease (Mpro), which plays a major role in mediating viral replication, makes it an attractive drug target. Virtual screening and three times repeated 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation of the best hits were performed to identify potential SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors from the available compounds of an antiviral plant Moringa oleifera. Three flavonoids isorhamnetin (1), kaempferol (2) and apigenin (3) showed good binding affinity, stable protein-ligand complexes throughout the simulation time, high binding energy and similar binding poses in comparison with known SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitor baicalein.

OBJECTIVES The objective of this study was to assess the impact of a culturally appropriate, home-based educational intervention on the knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding prevention and treatment of URIs among urban Latinos. METHODS Using a pretest-posttest design, Spanish-language educational materials available from sources such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were adapted based on feedback from community focus groups and provided to households during an in-person home visit every 2 months (generally three to four visits). Outcome data regarding knowledge, attitudes, and practices were collected in home-based interviews using an 85-item instrument adapted and pilot tested from three other validated instruments. Nonparametric and multiple linear regression analyses were used to summarize data and identify predictors of knowledge scores. RESULTS Four hundred twenty-two households had complete data at baseline and 6 months. Knowledge and attitude scores were improved significantly, and use of alcohol hand sanitizer and rates of influenza vaccine were increased significantly (all p <.01). DISCUSSION Although this home-based educational intervention was successful in improving knowledge, attitudes, and self-reported practices among urban Latinos regarding prevention and treatment of URIs, further research is needed to determine the cost-effectiveness of such a person-intensive intervention, the long-term outcomes, and whether less intensive interventions might be equally effective.","Larson, Elaine L; Ferng, Yu-Hui; McLoughlin, Jennifer Wong; Wang, Shuang; Morse, Stephen S",Nursing research,https://doi.org/10.1097/nnr.0b013e3181a30951; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19373116/,354

Despite this recent success, there are still several aspects related to the structure, function and dynamics of the CoV-2 polymerase that still need to be addressed. This includes understanding the dynamicity of the various polymerase subdomains, analyzing the hydrogen bond networks at the active site and at the template entry in the presence of water, studying the binding modes of the nucleotides at the active site, highlighting positions for acceptable nucleotides' substitutions that can be tolerated at different positions within the nascent RNA strand, identifying possible allosteric sites within the polymerase structure and studying their correlated dynamics relative to the catalytic site. Here, we combined various cutting-edge modelling tools with the recently resolved SARS-CoV-2 cryo-EM polymerase structures to fill this gap in knowledge. Our findings provide a detailed analysis of the hydrogen bond networks at various parts of the polymerase structure and suggest possible nucleotides' substitutions that can be tolerated by the polymerase complex. We also report here three 'druggable' allosteric sites within the NSP12 RdRp that can be targeted by small molecule inhibitors. Our correlated motion analysis shows that the dynamics within one of the newly identified sites are linked to the active site, indicating that targeting this site can significantly impact the catalytic activity of the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

142709,Pharmacist's Role and Pharmaceutical Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2021,"Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is an enveloped (+) RNA virus belonging to the family Coronaviridae. Among the viral membrane proteins, the spike (S) protein mediates receptor recognition/attachment to the host cell and fusion of viral and cellular membranes. The cytoplasmic tail of the S protein contains a tyrosine-dependent sorting signal with the consensus sequence YXXΦ. In the context of the S protein of TGEV (1440YEPI1443), this motif acts as a retention signal, preventing surface expression of the protein. Here, we show that a chimeric S protein, containing the six C-terminal amino acids of the glycoprotein G of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is no longer retained intracellularly, despite the presence of the tyrosine tetrapeptide motif. Following transport to the cell surface, the chimeric protein was rapidly endocytosed. Analysis of mutant proteins generated by site-directed mutagenesis revealed that a single amino acid exchange (1445K/M, position: +2 downstream of the tyrosine-based motif) was responsible for the altered sorting behavior.","Paul, André; Trincone, Anna; Siewert, Sandra; Herrler, Georg; Schwegmann-Weßels, Christel",Biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1515/hsz-2013-0282; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24603841/,354

OBJECTIVE To assess the clinical effectiveness of admission avoidance hospital at home (HAH) with CGA for older persons. DESIGN Multisite randomized trial. (ISRCTN registry number: ISRCTN60477865). SETTING 9 hospital and community sites in the United Kingdom. PATIENTS 1055 older persons who were medically unwell, were physiologically stable, and were referred for a hospital admission. INTERVENTION Admission avoidance HAH with CGA versus hospital admission with CGA when available using 2:1 randomization. MEASUREMENTS The primary outcome of living at home was measured at 6 months. Secondary outcomes were new admission to long-term residential care, death, health status, delirium, and patient satisfaction. RESULTS Participants had a mean age of 83.3 years (SD, 7.0). At 6-month follow-up, 528 of 672 (78.6%) participants in the CGA HAH group versus 247 of 328 (75.3%) participants in the hospital group were living at home (relative risk [RR], 1.05 [95% CI, 0.95 to 1.15]; P = 0.36); 114 of 673 (16.9%) versus 58 of 328 (17.7%) had died (RR, 0.98 [CI, 0.65 to 1.47]; P = 0.92); and 37 of 646 (5.7%) versus 27 of 311 (8.7%) were in long-term residential care (RR, 0.58 [CI, 0.45 to 0.76]; P < 0.001). LIMITATION The findings are most applicable to older persons referred from a hospital short-stay acute medical assessment unit; episodes of delirium may have been undetected. CONCLUSION Admission avoidance HAH with CGA led to similar outcomes as hospital admission in the proportion of older persons living at home as well as a decrease in admissions to long-term residential care at 6 months. This type of service can provide an alternative to hospitalization for selected older persons.

Antibodies or antibody fragments can be easily raised against virtually any target. Despite these fundamental advantages, the power and impact of protein-based agents are substantially undermined, only acting on a limited number of extracellular targets because macrobiomolecules cannot spontaneously cross the cell membrane. Conventional protein delivery techniques fail to address this fundamental problem in that protein cargos are predominantly delivered inside cells via endocytosis, a remarkably effective cell defense mechanism developed by Mother Nature to prevent intact biomolecules from entering the cytoplasm. Here, we report a unique concept, noncovalent cholesterol tagging, enabling virtually any compact proteins to permeate through the cell membrane, completely bypassing endocytosis.

145393,Combined cutting balloon and conventional balloon angioplasty in a dog with supravalvular pulmonary stenosis.,2018,"BACKGROUND Globally, gender as a barrier or facilitator in achieving health outcomes is increasingly being documented. However, the role of gender in health programming and organization is frequently ignored. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative, one of the largest globally coordinated public health programs in history, has faced and worked to address gender-based challenges as they emerge. This paper seeks to describe the role of gender power relations in the polio program across global, national, subnational, and front-line levels to offer lessons learned for global programs. METHODS We conducted qualitative key-informant interviews with individuals purposively selected from the polio universe globally and within seven country partners: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, and Nigeria. The interview tool was designed to explore nuances of implementation challenges, strategies, and consequences within polio eradication. All interviews were conducted in the local or official language, audio-recorded, and transcribed. We employed a deductive coding approach and used four gender analysis domains to explore data at the household, community, workplace, and organizational levels. RESULTS We completed 196 interviews globally and within each partner country; 74.5% of respondents were male and 25.5% were female. Male polio workers were not allowed to enter many households in conservative communities which created demand for female vaccinators. This changed the dynamics of front-line program teams and workplaces and empowered many women to enter the workplace for the first time. However, some faced challenges with safety and balancing obligations at home. Women were less likely to receive promotions to managerial or supervisory roles; this was also reflected at the global level. Some described how this lack of diverse management and leadership negatively affected the quality of program planning, delivery and limited accountability. CONCLUSIONS Gender power relations play an important role in determining the success of global health programs from global to local levels. Without consideration of gender, large-scale programs may fail to meet targets and/or reinforce gender inequities. Global disease programs should incorporate a gender lens in planning and implementation by engaging men and boys, supporting women in the workplace, and increasing diversity and representation among leadership.","Kalbarczyk, Anna; Rao, Aditi; Adebayo, Adedamola; Decker, Ellie; Gerber, Sue; Morgan, Rosemary",Global health research and policy,https://doi.org/10.1186/s41256-021-00203-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34183074/,354

Previous reports have shown that some microRNAs are induced during virus infection and participate in the regulation of the innate antiviral response. However, whether the type I IFN response is regulated by miR-223 is still unknown. Here, we reported that vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection induced significant up-regulation of miR-223 in murine macrophages. We observed that miR-223 overexpression up-regulated type I IFN expression levels in VSV-infected macrophages. We also demonstrated that miR-223 directly targets FOXO3 to regulate the type I IFN production. Furthermore, type I IFN, which is triggered by VSV infection, is responsible for the up-regulation of miR-223, thus forming a positive regulatory loop for type I IFN production. Our results uncovered a novel mechanism of miR-223-mediated regulation of type I IFN production in the antiviral innate immunity for the first time.","Chen, Luoquan; Song, Yinjing; He, Li; Wan, Xiaopeng; Lai, Lihua; Dai, Feng; Liu, Yang; Wang, Qingqing",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m115.700252; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27226534/,354

Objective The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of FC to (a) differentiate between perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease (pCD) and cryptoglandular perianal fistulas; and (b) detect mucosal inflammation in pCD. Methods Patients with active perianal fistulas who had FC measured and a complete ileocolonoscopy within 10 weeks were retrospectively included. Results Fifty-six patients were included (pCD, n = 37) of whom 19 pCD patients exhibited ulcers. FC was significantly higher in pCD compared to cryptoglandular fistulas (µg/g) (708.0 (207.0-1705.0) vs 32.0 (23.0-77.0), p < 0.001). Area-under-the-curve (AUC) value for FC receiver operating characteristic (ROC) statistics was 0.900. Optimal FC cut-off was ≥ 150 µg/g. To differentiate pCD from cryptoglandular fistulas in the absence of luminal inflammation, optimal cut-off remained ≥ 150 µg/g (AUC = 0.857, sensitivity = 0.81, specificity = 0.89, positive predictive value (PPV) = 93.8% and negative predictive value (NPV) = 70.8%). In pCD, FC was significantly increased in the presence of ulcers (1672.0 vs 238.0, p = 0.004). Optimal cut-off was ≥ 250 µg/g (AUC = 0.776; sensitivity = 0.89, specificity = 0.56, PPV - 68.0% and NPV = 83.0%). Conclusion FC discriminates pCD from cryptoglandular fistulas, even in the absence of intestinal ulcers. In active pCD, an elevated FC does not accurately predict the presence of ulcers and should be interpreted with caution.","Stevens, Toer W; D'Haens, Geert R; Duijvestein, Marjolijn; Bemelman, Willem A; Buskens, Christianne J; Gecse, Krisztina B",United European gastroenterology journal,https://doi.org/10.1177/2050640619834464; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31065367/,354

However, only a limited number of predominantly persistent perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) have been analyzed in edible plants so far. We present a generic trace analytical method that allows for quantification of 16 intermediate fluorotelomer alcohol (FTOH)- or perfluoroalkane sulfonamidoethanol (FASE)-based transformation products as well as 18 PFAAs in plants. Additionally, 36 suspected intermediate PFAS transformation products were qualitatively analyzed. The ultrasound-assisted solid-liquid extraction of wheat and maize grain, maize leaves, Jerusalem artichoke and ryegrass (1-5 g plant sample intake) was followed by a clean-up with dispersive solid-phase extraction using graphitized carbon adsorbent (5-10 mg per sample) and chemical analysis by reversed phase liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The method was based on matrix matched and extracted calibration and displayed good precision with relative standard deviations in triplicate analyses typically below 15% for all quantified analytes and matrices. An average deviation of 12% between quantified concentrations obtained by matrix matched and extracted calibration and a method based on isotopically labelled internal standards underlines the good trueness of the method. The method quantification limits for the majority of analytes in all plant samples were in the low ng/kg concentration range on a dry weight basis. Plant matrices were analyzed from crops grown on agricultural fields that have been contaminated with PFASs. FTOH- and/or FASE-based intermediate transformation products were detected in all samples with N-ethyl perfluorooctane sulfonamidoacetic acid (EtFOSAA) and perfluorooctane sulfonamide (FOSA) as the prevailing compounds in concentrations up to several hundred ng/kg in maize leaves. The 9:3 Acid (a transformation product of 10:2 FTOH) was tentatively identified. In accordance with these findings, the final degradation products perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA) were frequently detected. For perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs), according to earlier findings, short chain homologues generally displayed the highest levels (up to 98 µg/kg for perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) in maize leaves). However, maize grain was an exception showing the highest concentrations for long chain PFCAs, whereas PFBA was not detected. The uptake of high levels of PFASs into plants is of concern since these may be used as animal feed or represent a direct exposure medium for humans.","Muschket, Matthias; Keltsch, Nils; Paschke, Heidrun; Reemtsma, Thorsten; Berger, Urs",Journal of chromatography.

This study screened natural products to identify compounds that inhibit STAT3 activity using a STAT3-dependent luciferase reporter system. Sugiol was identified as a compound that decreased luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner. Sugiol specifically inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation at Tyr-705 in DU145 prostate cells, and this inhibition was independent of the STAT3 upstream kinase. Sugiol induced cell cycle arrest and decreased the expression levels of STAT3 target genes, such as cyclin D1, cyclin A, and survivin. Notably, we observed that sugiol interacted with transketolase, an enzyme in central metabolism, and increased ROS levels leading to the activation of ERK, which inhibits STAT3 activity. The protein phosphatase MEG2 was also responsible for sugiol-induced STAT3 dephosphorylation. The inhibitory effect of sugiol on cell growth was confirmed using the DU145 mouse xenograft model. We propose that sugiol inhibits STAT3 activity through a mechanism that involves the inhibition of transketolase, which leads to increased ROS levels and MEG2 activation in DU145 cells. Therefore, sugiol is the first compound regulating STAT3 activity via modulation of cancer metabolic pathway and we suggest the use of sugiol as an inhibitor of the STAT3 pathway for the treatment of human solid tumors with activated STAT3.","Jung, Seung-Nam; Shin, Dae-Seop; Kim, Hye-Nan; Jeon, Yoon Jung; Yun, Jieun; Lee, Yu-Jin; Kang, Jong Soon; Han, Dong Cho; Kwon, Byoung-Mog",Biochemical pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bcp.2015.06.033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26212545/,354

METHODS This is a single-centre prospective study. Patients with an SFK and a tumour smaller than 3.5 cm, treated with RFA over a 7.5-year period, were included. Nineteen consecutive patients (12 male), aged between 33 and 83 years (mean 61.4), were treated for 23 lesions. Primary endpoints were technical success and tumour recurrence rate. Secondary endpoints were the deterioration of renal function and overall survival rate. RESULTS The mean follow-up was 56.1 months (range 36-102). Primary technical success was 100 %. There were no major peri-procedural complications. In two cases, minor complications occurred. There was no significant difference between the baseline glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and GFR at 3, 12 and 24 months post-procedure. In four lesions (17 %), recurrence was detected and an additional RFA session was performed. None of the patients developed renal failure during their lifetime. Three of the patients died because of other reasons. CONCLUSIONS Percutaneous RFA of small renal tumours in patients with an SFK offers very satisfactory long-term results regarding preservation of renal function, local tumour control and overall survival. KEY POINTS • Tumour in a single functioning kidney requires minimally invasive treatment. • Radiofrequency ablation plays an established role in managing small renal tumours. • Long-term results of radiofrequency ablation have shown satisfactory local tumour control. • Long-term results have also shown that renal function may be preserved.","Krokidis, Miltiadis; Spiliopoulos, Stavros; Jarzabek, Magdalena; Fotiadis, Nikos; Sabharwal, Tarun; O'Brien, Tim; Adam, Andy",European radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-013-2802-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23475163/,354
151637,Tuberculosis due to Mycobacterium bovis in pet cats associated with feeding a commercial raw food diet.,2019,"OBJECTIVE Prior studies suggested that early drain removal prevented the development of pancreatic fistula (PF) after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD), but there has been no corresponding prospective trial for distal pancreatectomy (DP). The purpose of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of early drain removal and triple-drug therapy (TDT) with gabexate mesilate, octreotide and carbapenem antibiotics to prevent PF after DP in patients at high-risk of developing PF. METHODS A total 71 patients who underwent a DP were enrolled. We prospectively divided them into two groups: the late-removal group, in which the drain remained in place for at least for 5 days postoperatively (n = 30) and the early-removal group in which the drain was removed on postoperative day 1 (POD1) (n = 41). For the patients with a high drain amylase level (≥10,000 IU/L) and patients with symptomatic intraperitoneal fluid collection, our original TDT was introduced. The primary endpoint was the safety and efficacy of this management, and the secondary endpoint was the incidence of PF. RESULTS The incidence of clinical PF was significantly lower in the early-removal group (0% vs. the late removal 16%; p < 0.001). In the early-removal group, TDT was administered to 12 patients (29%) and none of the patients needed additional treatment after TDT. CONCLUSIONS Postoperative management after DP with early drain removal and TDT was safe and effective for preventing PF.","Adachi, Tomohiko; Kuroki, Tamotsu; Kitasato, Amane; Hirabaru, Masataka; Matsushima, Hajime; Soyama, Akihiko; Hidaka, Masaaki; Takatsuki, Mitsuhisa; Eguchi, Susumu",Pancreatology : official journal of the International Association of Pancreatology (IAP) ...

152140,Video-assisted thoracoscopic thymectomy using 5-mm ports and LigaSure.,2016,"Preclinical studies evaluating plague vaccine candidates have demonstrated that the F1 and V protein antigens of Yersinia pestis confer protection against challenge from virulent strains. Live-attenuated ΔphoP/Q Salmonella typhimurium recombinants were constructed expressing either F1, V antigens, F1 and V antigens, or a F1-V fusion from Asd (+) balanced-lethal plasmids. To improve antigen delivery, genes encoding plague antigens were modified in order to localize antigens to specific bacterial cellular compartments which include cytoplasmic, outer membrane, or secreted. Candidate vaccine strains were evaluated for growth characteristics, full-length lipopolysaccharide (LPS), plasmid stability, and antigen expression in vitro. Plague vaccine candidate strains with favorable in vitro profiles were evaluated in murine or rabbit preclinical oral immunogenicity studies. Attenuated S. typhimurium strains expressing cytoplasmically localized F1-V and V antigen antigens were more immunogenic than strains that secreted or localized plague antigens to the outer membrane. In particular, S. typhimurium M020 and M023, which express Asd(+)-plasmid derived soluble F1-V and soluble V antigen, respectively, at high levels in the bacterial cell cytoplasm were found to induce the highest levels of plague-specific serum antibodies. To further evaluate balanced-lethal plasmid retention capacity, ΔphoP/Q S. typhimurium PurB(+) and GlnA(+) balanced-lethal plasmid systems harboring F1-V were compared with M020 in vitro and in BALB/c mice in a immunogenicity study. Although there was no detectable difference in plague antigen expression in vitro, S. typhimurium M020 was the most immunogenic plague antigen vector strain evaluated, inducing high-titer serum IgG antibodies specific against F1, V and F1-V.","Sizemore, Donata R; Warner, Elizabeth A; Lawrence, Julie A; Thomas, Lawrence J; Roland, Kenneth L; Killeen, Kevin P",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,https://doi.org/10.4161/hv.18670; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22327496/,354

153253,Successful retrieval of a retained capsule endoscope with single incision laparoscopic surgery.,2014,"Ketamine, the phencyclidine derivative described in 1965, is an intravenous anesthetic with a variety of applications. The enthusiasm following its initial release subsided due to side effects from the central nervous system. New anesthetics limited the role of ketamine in anesthetic practice. However, its hemodynamically stable profile, along with its beneficial respiratory properties and analgesic potency, rendered the drug invaluable in battlefield medicine, sedation of the uncooperative child, analgesia, and sedation in burn units. Reevaluation, though, of analgesic properties of ketamine resulted in new interest regarding its use in perioperative and chronic pain management. Moreover, recent studies in the effects of the substance on intracranial pressure and cerebral blood flow led to revising the recommendation against its use in brain injury. Furthermore, the bronchodilating effects of the substance led to increasing interest for potential use in asthma treatment. In addition, separation of the 2 enantiomers and subsequent separate studies indicated beneficial results of the S(+) one. Thus, new controlled multicentered clinical trials are to be conducted to justify approval for new uses of ketamine and take advantage of its unique range of applications.","Aroni, Filippia; Iacovidou, Nicoletta; Dontas, Ismene; Pourzitaki, Chryssa; Xanthos, Theodoros",Journal of clinical pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1177/0091270009337941; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19546251/,354

The goal of the present study was to determine the effects of these meniscal tears and meniscal repair on tibiofemoral joint contact pressure and area. METHODS Eleven fresh-frozen cadaveric knees were loaded to 1000 N of axial load at 0, 30, 60, and 90 of flexion with use of a custom testing apparatus attached to a materials testing machine. Tibiofemoral translations and internal-external and varus-valgus rotations were unconstrained. The knees were tested under four conditions: intact, medial meniscal tear, repaired meniscal tear, and total medial meniscectomy. Radial split tears were created in six knees, and vertical tears were created in five knees. Pressure-sensitive film was used to measure tibiofemoral contact pressure and area. RESULTS Radial split tears of the medial meniscus did not cause significant changes in tibiofemoral joint contact pressure and area. Vertical tears of the medial meniscus caused increases in tibiofemoral joint contact pressure and reductions in contact area in the medial and lateral compartments that were not significantly different from those associated with total medial meniscectomy. The exception was at 90, where the lateral compartment pressure associated with the vertical tear of the medial meniscus was higher than that associated with total medial meniscectomy. In general, after repair of the vertical tear, contact pressure and area values were similar to those in the intact condition. CONCLUSIONS Radial split tears of the medial meniscus that extend from the inner rim to the peripheral third of the meniscus do not cause significant changes in joint contact area and pressure. Vertical tears of the medial meniscus cause nonsignificant increases in joint contact pressure and reductions in contact area in the medial and lateral compartments.Repair of the vertical tear reverses these contact changes, resulting in contact pressure and area similar to the intact state.","Muriuki, M G; Tuason, D A; Tucker, B G; Harner, C D",The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

Method: A large sample of adults who had sustained mild, moderate or severe TBIs seven months prior (N = 165) and a control group (N = 106) underwent DTI and cognitive testing. Fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity were calculated for 5 regions (corpus callosum: genu, body, splenium; fornix; superior longitudinal fasciculus) that recent meta-analyses identified as being affected by TBI and related to cognition following TBI. Memory, attention and executive functioning, which are often affected by TBI, were assessed. Results: Overall, mild TBI did not show significant WM or cognitive changes, relative to controls, but moderate to severe TBI was associated with large WM alterations (all regions) and poorer cognitive performance. No significant correlations were found between DTI findings and cognition in the moderate to severe group. Conclusions: The findings have shown that moderate to severe TBI leads to considerable WM and cognitive changes. Early and ongoing examination of mild TBI is needed to determine whether WM and cognitive changes are initially present and, if so, when they resolve.

155010,Transrectal guidance of the ovaries reduces operative time during bovine laparoscopic ovariectomy.,2017,"Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) infection induced apoptosis in several cell lines in vitro. Our previous studies demonstrated that TGEV could activate FasL- and mitochondria-mediated pathways to induce apoptosis in PK-15 cells. In this study, we investigated the regulation of p53 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signalling pathways in the interaction of TGEV with host cells. We observed that TGEV infection decreased p300/CBP, downregulated MDM2 and promoted p53 phosphorylation at serines 15, 20 and 46, resulting in accumulation and activation of p53 in PK-15 cells. TGEV infection induced the transient activation of p38 MAPK in the early phase of inoculation and constant activation in the later phase of infection. However, UV-irradiated TGEV did not promote the activation of p53 and p38 MAPK in the later phase, whereas it only triggered the transient activation of p38 MAPK in the early phase. Blocking of p53 activation significantly inhibited the occurrence of apoptosis through suppressing the TGEV-induced FasL expression, Bcl-2 reduction, Bax and cytochrome c redistribution, while inhibition of p38 activity moderately blocked apoptosis induction and partly attenuated the accumulation and activation of p53. However, inhibition of p38 and p53 activity had no significant effects on viral gene transcription at 12 and 24 h post-infection. Taken together, these results demonstrated that TGEV infection promoted the activation of p38 MAPK and p53 signalling, and p53 signalling might play a dominant role in the regulation of cell apoptosis. These findings provide new insights into the function of p53 and p38 MAPK in the interaction of TGEV with host cells.","Huang, Yong; Ding, Li; Li, Zhaocai; Dai, Meiling; Zhao, Xiaomin; Li, Wei; Du, Qian; Xu, Xingang; Tong, Dewen",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.051557-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23677787/,354

On various clinical isolates, the lead compounds 6i and 12a exhibited antibacterial activity comparable with that of benzalkonium chloride while higher than that of miramistin. Moreover, 6i and 12a were able to kill bacteria embedded into the matrix of mono- and dual species biofilms. The treatment of bacterial cells by either 6i and 12a lead to fast depolarization of the membrane suggesting that the membrane is an apparent molecular target of compounds. 6i and 12a were non mutagenic neither in SOS-chromotest nor in Ames test and non-toxic in vivo at acute oral (LD50 > 2000 mg/kg) and cutaneous administration (LD50 > 2500 mg/kg) on mice.

With no vaccine currently available, using behavioural measures to reduce the spread of the virus within the population is an important tool in mitigating the effects of this pandemic. As such, social distancing measures are being implemented globally and have proven an effective tool in slowing the large-scale spread of the virus. Aim: This scoping review will focus on answering key questions about the state of the evidence on the behavioural determinants of adherence to social distancing measures in research on COVID-19. Methods: A scoping review will be conducted in accordance with guidelines for best practice. Literature searches will be conducted using online databases and grey literature sources. Databases will include Medline, Web of Science, Embase and PsycInfo, alongside relevant pre-print servers. Grey literature will be searched on Google Scholar. Screening, data extraction and quality appraisal will be conducted by members of the research team, with any discrepancies resolved by consensus discussion. Quality appraisal will be conducted using the Cochrane's ROBINS-I tool, the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, and the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist where appropriate. Results will be analysed by mapping findings onto the Theoretical Domains Framework and visualising characteristics of the included studies using EviAtlas.

The secondary purpose was to compare the economic cost of those methods for the Spanish health service. METHOD A failure mode and effects analysis was carried out to attain the primary objective. For the secondary objective, an in-depth analysis was performed of the economic costs associated with each program using a cost-minimization analysis. RESULTS The failure mode and effects analysis resulted in scores of 184, 170 and 126 points for the health center collection, home delivery and community pharmacy collection programs, respectively. The economic evaluation, for its part, rendered estimated costs of €18,434.52, €11,417.08 and €7,986.52 for home delivery, health center collection and community pharmacy collection services, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The results of the study indicated that collection at the community pharmacy was the program associated to the lowest risk, most likely due to the crucial role of the pharmacist regarding the custody and preservation of medicines. As regards cost, dispensation at the community pharmacy was also associated with the lowest cost. Nevertheless, this finding was biased by the fact that, given the generous collaboration of pharmaceutical distributors during the COVID-19 pandemic, the cost of transport and delivery to the pharmacy during the study period was zero. Further economic analyses are required to evaluate the costs of community pharmacy delivery and determine their impact on the public health system in cases where transport costs are different from zero.","Caballero-Romero, Álvaro; Fernández, Sergio; Morillo, Ana Belén; Zaragoza-Rascón, Mariana; Jaramillo-Pérez, Catalina; Del Pozo-Rubio, Raúl",Farmacia hospitalaria : organo oficial de expresion cientifica de la Sociedad Espanola de Farmacia Hospitalaria,https://doi.org/10.7399/fh.11532; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33709888/,354

157437,Lipid charge regulation of non-specific biological ion channels.,2014,"Aim: Cryotherapy is commonly implemented following soccer match-play in an attempt to accelerate the natural time-course of recovery, but the effect of this intervention on neuromuscular function is unknown. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of donning lower-body garments fitted with cooled phase change material (PCM) on recovery of neuromuscular function following competitive soccer match-play. Methods: Using a randomized, crossover design, 11 male semi-professional soccer players wore PCM cooled to 15°C (PCMcold) or left at ambient temperature (PCMamb; sham control) for 3 h following soccer match-play. Pre-, and 24, 48, and 72 h post-match, participants completed a battery of neuromuscular, physical, and perceptual tests. Maximal voluntary contraction force (MVC) and twitch responses to electrical (femoral nerve) and magnetic (motor cortex) stimulation (TMS) during isometric knee-extension and at rest were measured to assess central nervous system (CNS) (voluntary activation, VA) and muscle contractile (quadriceps potentiated twitch force, Qtw,pot) function. Fatigue and perceptions of muscle soreness were assessed via visual analog scales, and physical function was assessed through measures of jump [countermovement jump (CMJ) height and reactive strength index (RSI)] performance. A belief questionnaire was completed pre- and post-intervention to determine the perceived effectiveness of each garment. Results: Competitive soccer match-play elicited persistent decrements in MVC, VA measured with femoral nerve stimulation, Qtw,pot, as well as reactive strength, fatigue and muscle soreness (P < 0.05). Both MVC and VA were higher at 48 h post-match after wearing PCMcold compared with PCMamb (P < 0.05). However, there was no effect of PCM on the magnitude or time-course of recovery for any other neuromuscular, physical function, or perceptual indices studied (P > 0.05). The belief questionnaire revealed that players perceived that both PCMcold and PCMamb were moderately effective in improving recovery, with no difference between the two interventions (P = 0.56). Conclusion: Although wearing cooled PCM garments improved MVC and VA 48 h following match-play, the lack of effect on measures of physical function or perceptual responses to match-play suggest that PCM offers a limited benefit to the recovery process. The lack of effect could have been due to the relatively small magnitude of change in most of the outcome measures studied.","Brownstein, Callum G; Ansdell, Paul; Škarabot, Jakob; McHugh, Malachy P; Howatson, Glyn; Goodall, Stuart; Thomas, Kevin",Frontiers in physiology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2019.00647; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31244667/,354

EXPERT OPINION Some commonly used vaccines are being considered for their potentially beneficial role in preventing or improving the prognosis of COVID-19: influenza, pneumococcal and tuberculosis vaccines. These vaccines may have either direct effect on COVID-19 via different types of immune responses or indirect effects by reducing the burden of viral and bacterial respiratory diseases on individual patients and national healthcare system and by facilitating differential diagnoses with other viral/bacterial respiratory disease. The latter may ultimately allow a more rapid SARS-CoV-2 infected patient isolation and contact tracing. On the other hand, a large number of candidate vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are currently in the pipeline and undergoing phase I, II and III clinical studies. As SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are expected to be marketed through accelerated regulatory pathways, vaccinovigilance as well as planning of a successful vaccination campaign will play a major role.","Sultana, Janet; Mazzaglia, Giampiero; Luxi, Nicoletta; Cancellieri, Antonino; Capuano, Annalisa; Ferrajolo, Carmen; de Waure, Chiara; Ferlazzo, Guido; Trifirò, Gianluca",Expert review of vaccines,https://doi.org/10.1080/14760584.2020.1825951; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32940090/,354
160336,South African report of first case of chromoblastomycosis caused by Cladosporium (syn Cladophialophora) carrionii infection in a cat with feline immunodeficiency virus and lymphosarcoma.,2015,"OBJECTIVE To evaluate long-term results of otoplasty using standardized measurements. METHODS We performed a retrospective study of patients who underwent otoplasty using a modified anterior scoring technique combined with postauricular fixation sutures. Two hundred twenty-two consecutive patients (421 primary otoplasties) were included. Each auricle was examined before surgery, after surgery, and at a long-term follow-up visit, and the distance between the lateral helical rim and the mastoid surface was measured at 3 points. In addition, patient satisfaction was evaluated using a questionnaire. RESULTS Seventy-two percent of 222 patients were examined at a long-term follow-up visit. Follow-up of 301 auricles was on average 6.25 years (range, 44-106 months). The mean preoperative measurements among all auricles were 23.3 mm at the uppermost point of the helix, 28.6 mm at the middle, and 25.9 mm at the lobule; these values were 14.2, 14.0, and 16.1 mm, respectively, at the end of the operation and 16.0, 17.5, and 17.4 mm, respectively, 6 years later. Long-term data revealed a median 2-mm lateralization of the auricle. The aesthetic result of otoplasty was rated as ""very good"" by 71.8% of patients and as ""good"" by 19.4% of patients; 6.9% of patients thought the result was ""satisfactory"" and 1.9% ""unsatisfactory."" Complete recurrence of the protrusion was seen in 7 ears (2.3%) and partial recurrence within the upper third of the pinna in 26 ears (8.6%). CONCLUSIONS Otoplasty using a modified anterior scoring technique combined with postauricular fixation sutures provides long-term improved results in 91.2% of cases. Complications and sequelae are few, and rates are comparable to those of other long-term studies. A 2-mm lateralization of the auricle may be expected. Standardized measurements of the auricle are important because they supplement the overall aesthetic evaluation of the corrected ear and provide an objective baseline for long-term follow-up.","Schlegel-Wagner, Christoph; Pabst, Gunther; Müller, Werner; Linder, Thomas",Archives of facial plastic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1001/archfacial.2010.34; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20479429/,354
160347,Retrospective analysis of pleural effusion in cats.,2018,"BACKGROUND Culture-positive Gram-negative sepsis induces greater magnitude of early innate immunity /inflammatory response compared with culture-negative sepsis. We previously demonstrated increased activation of anti-inflammatory Glucagon Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) hormone in initial phase of sepsis more pronounced in diabetes patients. However, whether GLP-1 system is hyper-activated during the early innate immune response to Gram-negative sepsis and modulated by diabetes remains unknown. OBJECTIVES Total and active GLP-1, soluble Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (sDPP-4) enzyme and innate immunity markers presepsin (sCD14) and procalcitonin (PCT) in plasma were determined by ELISA on admission and after 2 to 4 days in 37 adult patients with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D) and Gram-negative or culture-negative sepsis of different severity. RESULTS Severe but not non-severe sepsis was associated with markedly increased GLP-1 system response, which correlated with PCT and the organ dysfunction marker lactate. Culture-positive Gram-negative bacteria but not culture-negative sepsis induced hyper-activation of GLP-1 system, which correlated with increased innate immune markers sCD14, PCT and lactate. GLP-1 inhibitory enzyme sDPP-4 was down regulated by sepsis and correlated negatively with sCD14 in Gram-negative sepsis. Diabetic patients demonstrated increased GLP-1 response but significantly weaker innate immune response to severe and Gram-negative sepsis. CONCLUSIONS Early stage of Gram-negative sepsis is characterized by endogenous GLP-1 system hyperactivity associated with over activation of innate immune response and organ dysfunction, which are modulated by diabetes. Total GLP-1 may be novel marker for rapid diagnosis of Gram-negative sepsis and its severity.","Bloch, Olga; Perl, Sivan H; Lazarovitch, Tsilia; Zelnik-Yovel, Dana; Love, Itamar; Mendel-Cohen, Lior; Goltsman, Galina; Flor, Hadar; Rapoport, Micha J",Shock,https://doi.org/10.1097/shk.0000000000001683; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33079891/,354

Tablets were manufactured by direct compression. Three different active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) concentrations were manufactured and three different compaction pressures were used. Intact tablets were analysed by transmission mode with NIRS prior to European Pharmacopoeia tests that were used as reference methods. Partial least square (PLS) regression was selected to build the prediction NIR models for content uniformity, tablet hardness and disintegration time. The prediction of NIR content uniformity and tablet hardness methods were validated using the accuracy profile approach. The values of the root mean squared error of calibration (RMSEC) and the root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) for the disintegration time indicated the robustness and the global accuracy of the NIR model. Regarding the tablet friability test, the classification was based on K-nearest neighbours (KNN). Then tablet NIR analyses successfully allowed the prediction of their conformity. Compared to the time consuming Pharmacopoeia reference methods, the benefit of this nondestructive method is significant, especially for reducing batch release time.","Pestieau, Aude; Krier, Fabrice; Thoorens, Grégory; Dupont, Anaïs; Chavez, Pierre-François; Ziemons, Eric; Hubert, Philippe; Evrard, Brigitte",Journal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpba.2014.05.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24880992/,354

To explore how communities around the United States are addressing workforce issues laid bare by the COVID-19 pandemic and how they are taking advantage of local opportunities to expand their science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine (STEMM) workforces to position them for success going forward, the Board of Higher Education and Workforce of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine convened a series of workshops to identify immediate and near-term regional STEMM workforce needs in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The workshop planning committee identified five U.S. cities and their associated metropolitan areas - Birmingham, Alabama;Boston, Massachusetts;Richmond, Virginia;Riverside, California;and Wichita, Kansas - to host workshops highlighting promising practices that communities can use to respond urgently and appropriately to their STEMM workforce needs. A sixth workshop discussed how the lessons learned during the five region-focused workshops could be applied in other communities to meet STEMM workforce needs.

176641,Graphical abstract TOC,2021-09-24,"Glycans play a vital role in health, disease, bioenergy, biomaterials, and biotherapeutics. As a result, there is keen interest to identify and increase glycan data in bioinformatics databases like ChEBI and PubChem, and connecting them to resources at the EMBL-EBI and NCBI to facilitate access to important annotations at a global level. GlyTouCan is a comprehensive archival database that contains glycans obtained primarily through batch upload from glycan repositories, glycoprotein databases, and individual laboratories. In many instances, the glycan structures deposited in GlyTouCan may not be fully defined or have supporting experimental evidence and citations. Databases like ChEBI and PubChem were designed to accommodate complete atomistic structures with well-defined chemical linkages. As a result, they cannot easily accommodate the structural ambiguity inherent in glycan databases. Consequently, there is a need to improve the organization of glycan data coherently to enhance connectivity across the major NCBI, EMBL-EBI, and glycoscience databases. This paper outlines a workflow developed in collaboration between GlyGen, ChEBI, and PubChem to improve the visibility and connectivity of glycan data across these resources. GlyGen hosts a subset of glycans (~29,000) from the GlyTouCan database and has submitted valuable glycan annotations to the PubChem database and integrated over 10,500 (including ambiguously defined) glycans into the ChEBI database. The integrated glycans were prioritized based on links to PubChem and connectivity to glycoprotein data. The pipeline provides a blueprint for how glycan data can be harmonized between different resources. The current PubChem, ChEBI, and GlyTouCan mappings can be downloaded from GlyGen (https://data.glygen.org).","Navelkar, Rahi; Owen, Gareth; Mutherkrishnan, Venkatesh; Thiessen, Paul; Cheng, Tiejun; Bolerlton, Evan; Edwards, Nathan; Tiemeyer, Michael; Campbell, Matthew P; Martin, Maria; Vora, Jeet; Kahsay, Robel; Mazumder, Raja",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.17.448729,354

However, these challenges are intensified with the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused a radical and unexpected rupture in daily life. This article aims to analyze the affective-semiotic dynamics of Brazilian women who experienced the transition to motherhood during the COVID-19 pandemic from a qualitative multiple case study. Eight women participated in the study in the city of Salvador. Data were collected from two narrative interviews with each participant conducted through videoconference, with a 2-month interval between interviews. The main finding reveals that the emergence of the pandemic was described by the participants as an unexpected and significant rupture in the transition to motherhood that raised feelings of fear and anxiety. In addition, I-other relations were marked by intense ambivalence between the need for social support and the risk of contagion, and the perspective and experience of childbirth were marked by a feeling of insecurity in the relations with the health personnel and settings. In light of Semiotic Cultural Psychology, three interdependent affective-semiotic fields were highlighted from the narratives: the perception of oneself regulated by the sign of vulnerability, the other regulated by the sign of a potential threat, and healthcare provision regulated by the sign of risk. These findings highlight the importance of quality healthcare that helps women to reduce the disruptive impact of the pandemic on the ontogenetic structure of psychological organization. © 2021 Hogrefe Publishing.","Volkmer Pontes, V.; Santos, J.

Educational institutions around the world have stressed online learning programs in the aftermath of the pandemic. However, because of insufficient access to Information Communication Technology (ICT), a substantial number of students failed to harness the opportunity of online learning. This study explores the latent digital divide exhibited during the COVID-19 pandemic while online learning activities are emphasised among students of Bangladesh. It also investigates the digital divide exposure and the significant underlying drivers of the divide. In order to accomplish this, a cross-sectional survey was employed to collect quantitative data, mixed with open-ended questions were utilised to gather qualitative information from the student community. The findings revealed that despite the majority of students having physical access to ICT, only 32.5% of students could attend online classes seamlessly. In total, 34.1% reported data prices as the critical barrier, while 39.8% identified poor network infrastructure as the significant barrier preventing them from participating in online learning activities. Although most students possess physical access to various devices and the Internet, they face the first-level digital divide due to the quality of access and price of cellular Internet. Consequently, they fail to take advantage of physical access, resulting in the third-level digital divide (utility gap), which submerges them into a digital divide cycle. The primary objective of this study is to explore the underlying issues of the digital divide among Bangladeshi students. This will assist relevant stakeholders (e.g., the Bangladesh government, educational institutions, and researchers) to gain necessary insights and theoretical understanding of underlying limitations and emergent directions to arrange adequate support for underprivileged students to undertake essential online learning activities.","Badiuzzaman, Md Rafiquzzaman Md.; Rabby, Md Insiat Islam Rahman Mohammad Mustaneer",Information,https://doi.org/10.3390/info12080287,354

This study aims to analyse the extent of polarised opinions across Spain, Italy and the United Kingdom regarding COVID-19 during 2020 within social media. To do this, we examined YouTube comments (n=111,808) using automatic analysis and machine-learning techniques based on algorithms. This methodological strategy denoted an innovative and unique quantitative approach for this field of study. In line with previous research, the hypothesis was that the degree of polarization does not crystallize in the same manner in different countries’ digital spheres. Therefore, it could be said that higher levels of polarization occur amongst Southern European countries like Spain and Italy (both countries adhering to a polarised pluralism model), compared to other countries ascribing to the liberal model (the United Kingdom in our study), which provides evidence supporting previous research studies. The results confirmed the hypothesis that the polarization of digital deliberation between Spain and Italy is higher than in the United Kingdom. But, also, the findings based on more disaggregated analysis suggest that the most polarized attitudes are even rewarded by other users in Mediterranean countries. © 2021","Luengo, Ó Dr García-Marín J.

This cross-sectional survey-based study compared aspects of nursing care and nurses’ satisfaction with care provided before and during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 936 registered nurses (RNs) rated the frequency with which they performed fundamental care, nursing techniques, patient education, symptom management, and nurse–patient relationships before and during the pandemic. A recursive partitioning for ordered multivariate response in a conditional inference framework approach was applied. More frequent fundamental cares were associated with their frequency before the pandemic (p <0.001), caring for COVID-19 patients (p <0.001), and workplace reassignment (p = 0.004). Caring for COVID-19 patients (p <0.001), workplace reassignment (p = 0.030), and caring for ≤7.4 COVID-19 patients (p = 0.014) increased nursing techniques. RNs in high-intensity COVID-19 units (p = 0.002) who educated patients before the pandemic, stopped this task. RNs caring for COVID-19 patients reported increased symptom management (p <0.001), as did RNs caring for more non-COVID-19 patients (p = 0.037). Less frequent nurse–patient relationships before the pandemic and working in high-intensity COVID-19 units decreased nurse–patient relationships (p = 0.002).

The presented study examines the seasonal and regional specifics that characterize the markets of Central and Eastern Europe. In a sample of almost 14,000,000 Facebook users, the user interactions with ten selected representatives of the e-commerce sector were recorded daily during the 2020/2021 Christmas season lasting 49 days.

The synthesis of the findings provided a knowledge base for compiling a preliminary version of the model of the COVID-19 pandemic impact on e-consumer behavior. In terms of changes in e-consumer behavior, it can be stated that the step change in e-behavior patterns caused by the pandemic merges with pre-pandemic behavior patterns.

Nonenteropathogenic porcine respiratory coronaviruses (PRCVs) have been derived from TGEV. The genetic relationship among six European PRCVs and five coronaviruses of the TGEV antigenic cluster has been determined based on their RNA sequences. The S proteins of six European PRCVs have an identical deletion of 224 amino acids starting at position 21. The deleted area includes the antigenic sites C and B of TGEV S glycoprotein. Interestingly, two viruses (NEB72 and TOY56) with respiratory tropism have the S protein with a similar size to the enteric viruses. NEB72 and TOY56 viruses have 2 and 15 specific amino acid differences with the enteric viruses, respectively. Four of the residues changed are located within the deletion present in the PRCVs and may influence the enteric tropism of TGEV in vivo. A receptor binding site (RBS) used by the virus to infect ST and other cell types might be located between sites A and D of the S glycoprotein, since monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for these sites inhibit the binding of the virus to ST cells. An evolutionary tree relating 13 enteric and respiratory isolates has been proposed. According to this tree, a main virus lineage evolved from a recent progenitor which was circulating around 1941. From this, secondary lineages originated PUR46, NEB72, TOY56, MIL65, BRI70, and the PRCVs, in this order. Least squares estimation of the origin of TGEV-related coronaviruses showed a significant constancy in the mutation fixation rate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Enjuanes, L; Sánchez, C; Gebauer, F; Méndez, A; Dopazo, J; Ballesteros, M L",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8209753/,354

190326,Demonstration of passive protection in neonatal calves against colibacillosis following immunization of pregnant heifers at 3 months of gestation.,2008,"BACKGROUND Respirators have received much attention since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to a substantial shortage of the most commonly used respirator, the N95 Filtering Facepiece Respirator (N95), as well as the desire to have added protection while performing aerosol generating procedures (AGPs), dental healthcare personnel (DHCP) have considered alternative respirator options. It is well documented in the medical literature that the Powered Air-Purifying Respirator (PAPR) provides better protection against respiratory pathogens; however, there are no reported cases that describe the use of PAPRs in the dental setting. This survey report evaluates the use of a loose-fitting full facepiece PAPR by different dental providers. OBJECTIVE To determine if a PAPR can be used in the dental setting and identify any potential barriers to use. METHODS Eleven DHCP representing general dentistry, dental hygiene, pediatric dentistry, endodontics, orthodontics, oral and maxillofacial surgery and maxillofacial prosthodontics at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC) and Naval Postgraduate Dental School (NPDS) were asked to wear the MAXAIR PAPR while performing an AGP. They then completed a 14-question survey. RESULTS There was a 100% response rate. All DHCP with the exception of the endodontist were able to successfully wear the MAXAIR PAPR for the duration of their procedure. All DHCP reported that the PAPR was more comfortable than expected. There were no reports of fogging or hindrance to visibility, breathing was unaffected or enhanced, and the noise level was tolerable. Average time to don and doff the PAPR was 5 minutes. All DHCP were able to wear loupes; some were not able to wear a headlight. Two DHCP reported a history of mild claustrophobia, and both were able to tolerate the PAPR without any issue. 44% preferred the PAPR over the N95. CONCLUSION This preliminary survey of a loose-fitting PAPR in the dental setting suggests there is a place for PAPRs in the dental community.","Oakes, Leslie A; Chi, Woo J; Welch, Rasha H",Medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33666919/,354
190469,Photolabeling probes of ribavirin and EICAR.,2005,"The development of autoimmune type 1 diabetes involves complex interactions among several genes and environmental agents. Human patients with type 1 diabetes show an unusually high frequency of wheat gluten-sensitive enteropathy; T-cell response to wheat proteins is increased in some patients, and high concentrations of wheat antibodies in blood have been reported. In both major models of spontaneous type 1 diabetes, the BioBreeding (BB) rat and non-obese diabetic mouse, at least half of the cases are diet-related. In studies of BB rats fed defined semipurified diets, wheat gluten was the most potent diabetes-inducing protein source. A major limitation in understanding how wheat or other dietary antigens affect type 1 diabetes has been the difficulty in identifying specific diabetes-related dietary proteins. To address this issue, we probed a wheat cDNA expression library with polyclonal IgG antibodies from diabetic BB rats. Three clones were identified, and the intensity of antibody binding to one of them, WP5212, was strongly associated with pancreatic islet inflammation and damage. The WP5212 putative protein has high amino acid sequence homology with a wheat storage globulin, Glb1. Serum IgG antibodies from diabetic rats and humans recognized low molecular mass (33-46 kDa) wheat proteins. Furthermore, antibodies to Glb1 protein were found in serum from diabetic patients but not in age-, sex-, and HLA-DQ-matched controls. This study raises the possibility that in some individuals, type 1 diabetes may be induced by wheat proteins. Also, it provides a first candidate wheat protein that is not only antigenic in diabetic rats and human patients but is also closely linked with the autoimmune attack in the pancreas.","MacFarlane, Amanda J; Burghardt, Karolina M; Kelly, John; Simell, Tuula; Simell, Olli; Altosaar, Illimar; Scott, Fraser W",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12409286/,354

To begin collecting necessary epidemiology and cost information about the illnesses caused by these viruses, we conducted a prospective cohort study in 118 Melbourne children between 12 and 71 months of age during winter and spring 2001. We were interested in calculating an average cost per episode of community-managed acute respiratory disease, in identifying the key cost drivers of such illness, and to identify the proportion of costs borne by the patient and family. There were 202 community-managed influenza-like illnesses identified between July and December 2001, generating 89 general practitioner visits, and 42 antibiotic prescriptions. The average cost of community-managed episodes (without hospitalisation) was dollar 241 (95% CI dollar 191 to dollar 291), with the key cost drivers being carer time away from usual activities caring for the ill child (70% of costs), use of non-prescription medications (5.4%), and general practice visits (5.0%). The patient and family met 87 per cent of total costs. The lowest average cost occurred in households from the highest income bracket. Acute respiratory illness managed in the community is common, with the responsibility for meeting the cost of episodes predominantly borne by the patient and family in the form of lost productivity. These findings have implications for preventive strategies in children, such as the individual use of, or implementation of public programs using, currently available vaccines against influenza and vaccines under development against other viral respiratory pathogens.","Lambert, Stephen; O'Grady, Kerry-Ann; Gabriel, Susan; Carter, Robert; Nolan, Terry",Communicable diseases intelligence quarterly report,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15745401/,354

This increases the risk of the emergence of a reassortant pandemic influenza virus with improved human-to-human transmissibility. Currently triage of suspected cases by epidemiological risk factors remains the only practical way of case identification for laboratory investigation and infection control. The clinical usefulness of rapid diagnostic laboratory tests requires more vigorous evaluation. The lethality of this disease may reflect systemic viral dissemination, cytokine storm, or alveolar flooding due to inhibition of cellular sodium channels. The present circulating genotype Z is intrinsically resistant to amantadine and rimantadine. Prognosis may be improved by early treatment with a neuraminidase inhibitor with good systemic drug levels, and post-exposure prophylaxis for health care workers is recommended. The role of immunomodulators and other modalities of therapy requires evaluation in randomised controlled trials, with prospective monitoring of the viral load and cytokine profiles in various clinical specimens. In view of the high fatality of the disease, a combination of contact, droplet, and airborne precautions are recommended as long as resources allow despite the fact that the relative importance of these three modes in nosocomial transmission of avian influenza is still unknown.","Yuen, K Y; Wong, S S Y",Hong Kong medical journal = Xianggang yi xue za zhi,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15951584/,354

The assembly procedure was initiated by the transfection of 293T cells with three plasmids: (i) a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) packaging construct, (ii) a transfer plasmid expressing a reporter gene, and (iii) a plasmid expressing large (L), middle (M), and small (S) HBV envelope proteins. After 2 days, hepatitis B surface antigen and the antigenic forms of L, M, and S were detected at the cell surface by flow cytometry. Also, virus particles that were able to infect cultured primary human hepatocytes (PHH) were released. Under optimal conditions, 50% of PHH could be infected. In addition, the susceptibility of PHH and the resistance of other cell types to the pseudotype particles were similar to those observed for HBV and hepatitis delta virus (HDV), which shares the same L, M, and S. Furthermore, the infection of PHH by the pseudotype was sensitive to known inhibitors of HBV and HDV entry. These findings of specific and efficient infection of hepatocytes could be applicable to liver-specific gene therapy and may help clarify the attachment and entry mechanism used by HBV and HDV.","Chai, Ning; Chang, Ho Eun; Nicolas, Emmanuelle; Gudima, Severin; Chang, Jinhong; Taylor, John",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17670822/,354

194631,Borna disease virus infection in FIV-positive cats in Germany.,2001,"Antibody-secreting cells (ASC) were enumerated in gut- and bronchus-associated lymphoid tissues of pigs exposed to three antigenically related coronaviruses: virulent transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), attenuated TGEV, and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV). Exposure of 11-day-old pigs to virulent TGEV resulted in severe gastroenteritis and virus shedding mainly in feces but also to a limited extent in nasal secretions. PRCV and attenuated TGEV exposure produced no clinical signs and only one pig given a high dose of attenuated TGEV shed virus in feces, but virus was shed from the nasal passages. Nasal virus titers were highest after PRCV inoculation of pigs. Mononuclear cells were isolated from spleens, mesenteric, and bronchial lymph nodes of pigs and assayed for virus-specific IgG and IgA antibody secretion by an enzyme-linked immunospot assay. Virus-specific ASC peaked at postinoculation days 12 to 24 and IgG-ASC outnumbered IgA-ASC in all tissues tested. The greatest numbers of ASC were in mesenteric lymph nodes of virulent TGEV-exposed pigs and in BLN of PRCV-exposed pigs. Attenuated TGEV induced intermediate ASC responses in the gut and respiratory tract. Secondary in vitro ASC responses to inactivated TGEV or PRCV paralleled the primary responses except in BLN where the numbers of memory ASC were high for both TGEV- and PRCV-exposed pigs. We conclude that: 1) a single exposure of pigs to PRCV either oral-nasally or by aerosol leads to potent systemic and bronchus-associated, but not gut-associated, ASC responses; 2) a high dose of attenuated TGEV (4 x 10(8) plaque-forming units) is more effective than PRCV (6 x 10(5) or 2 x 10(8) plaque-forming units) or a lower dose of attenuated TGEV (7 x 10(6) plaque-forming units) in eliciting gut-associated ASC; 3) although virulent and a high dose of attenuated TGEV induce high numbers of ASC in the tissues tested, virulent TGEV induces the most ASC in the gut and IgA-ASC in all lymphoid tissues; and 4) virus replication in the gut or respiratory tract is a major factor affecting the magnitude of an ASC response at that site and may be necessary for the recruitment of IgG- and IgA-ASC and memory cells in large numbers from other mucosal inductive sites. This unique model of mucosal immunity using antigenically related viruses with distinct tissue tropisms may help to clarify interactions of the various components of the common mucosal immune system.","VanCott, J L; Brim, T A; Simkins, R A; Saif, L J",Journal of immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8386204/,354

A new immunofluorescence assay using Trichoplusia ni insect cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus expressing the VP1 protein of HBoV was developed, and the levels of immunoglobulin G antibody to the VP1 protein of HBoV in serum samples were measured. The overall seroprevalence rate of antibodies against the VP1 protein of HBoV in a Japanese population aged from 0 months to 41 years was 71.1% (145 of 204). The seropositive rate was lowest in the age group of 6 to 8 months and gradually increased with age. All of the children had been exposed to HBoV by the age of 6 years. A rise in titers of antibody against the VP1 protein of HBoV during the convalescent phase was observed for four patients with lower respiratory tract infections, and HBoV DNA was detected in nasopharyngeal swab and serum samples from all four patients. These results suggest that HBoV is a ubiquitous virus acquired early in life and that HBoV might play a role in the course of lower respiratory tract infections.","Endo, Rika; Ishiguro, Nobuhisa; Kikuta, Hideaki; Teramoto, Shinobu; Shirkoohi, Reza; Ma, Xiaoming; Ebihara, Takashi; Ishiko, Hiroaki; Ariga, Tadashi",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17699639/,354

We aimed to determine the frequency of a broad panel of respiratory viruses including human bocavirus (HBoV) and to assess the clinical characteristics of acute bronchiolitis in a group of children under 24 months of age. A total of 62 children (45 male, 17 female; age range: 0-2 years) with the initial diagnosis of acute bronchiolitis and 33 healthy children (21 male, 12 female; age range: 0-2 years) as control group who were admitted to the Pediatrics Department of Mersin University Hospital, southern Turkey, from January to July 2010 were included in the study. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from the study groups and the detection of respiratory viruses [respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A & B; rhinovirus (RV); human metapneumovirus (hMPV) A & B; influenza virus type A [H1N1, H3N2, H1N1v], B & C; parainfluenza virus (PIV) type 1, 2, 3 & 4A/B; adenovirus (AdV); HBoV; coronavirus (CoV 229E); enterovirus (EV)], were performed by using a commercial system namely CLART®Pneumovir (Clinical Array Technology, Genomica, Spain) based on the principle of multiplex polymerase chain reaction (M-PCR) and DNA microarray. Demographic features, clinical and laboratory findings of the patients, treatment protocols and the relationship between the length of hospitalization and the viral agents determined were also evaluated. Of the 62 samples collected from bronchiolitis cases, at least one virus was detected in 52 (83.9%) and viral co-infections were detected in 31 (50%) of them. Including the co-infections, RSV was the most commonly identified virus (n= 21; 33.9%), followed by influenza A [H1N1] (n= 18; 29%), RV (n= 18; 29%), hMPV (n= 13; 21%), PIV (n= 10; 16.1%), AdV (n= 5; 8%), HBoV (n= 3; 4.8%) and EV (n= 1; 1.6%). Of the 33 samples from healthy children, at least one virus was detected in 21 (63.6%) and viral co-infections were detected in seven (21.2%) samples. Including the co-infections, the most commonly detected virus was RV (n= 10; 30.3%), followed by influenza A [H1N1] (n= 6; 18.1%), AdV (n= 6; 18.1%), RSV (n= 4; 12.1%) and PIV (n= 3; 9%), however HBoV and hMPV were not detected in the control group. The differences of demographic features (age, gender, history of atopy, exposure of smoking, length of breast-feeding, presence of school-age sibling) and frequency of virus detection (83.9% and 63.6%, respectively) between the patient and control groups were not statistically significant (p> 0.05). The most common complaints of patients on admission were cough (100%), runny nose (82.3%) and respiratory difficulty (71%), whereas fever was present in 21 (33.9%) patients. The most common findings on physical examination were prolonged expirium (98.4%), rhonchi (98.4%), rales (80.6%), tachypnea (71%) and tachycardia (67.7%). Pulmonary graphies revealed that diffuse air trappings were more common in virus-associated bronchiolitis (36/52; 69.2%) cases, on the other hand infiltrations were more common (6/10; 60%) in patients who were virus-negative (p< 0.05). The demographic features, clinical and laboratory findings, clinical severity scores, hospitalization rates and duration of hospitalizations in bronchiolitis cases did not show statistically significant differences between the viral agents (p> 0.05 for each parameter). However the rates of antibiotic and steroid use in hospitalized patients (24/34 and 5/34, respectively) were significantly higher than those of outpatients (7/28 and 0/28, respectively) (p= 0.001 and p= 0.03). Our data indicated a high rate (~84%) of respiratory viruses in children with bronchiolitis in the Mersin province and the detection of hMPV (21%) and HBoV (4.8%) only in the patient group encouraged their roles in the etiology of acute brochiolitis. It was concluded that viral etiology should be investigated in selected cases to prevent unnecessary antibiotic treatment and to initiate appropriate antiviral therapy when necessary.","Uyar, Mustafa; Kuyucu, Necdet; Tezcan, Seda; Aslan, Gönül; Tasdelen, Bahar",Mikrobiyoloji bulteni,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24819262/,354

Our objective was to compare the volume of patients with urologic emergencies presenting to emergency departments (EDs) within a single health system before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective chart review was performed for 3 EDs within a single health system in the United States to identify all ED consults to urology from January 1, 2019 to May 31, 2020. For emergent consults, covariates were extracted, including demographic information, insurance status, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score, travel distance from home to the ED, and whether the patient had seen a provider in the hospital system before. Data were compared between COVID-19 months (March-May 2020) and corresponding months in 2019. RESULTS The study period encompassed 1,179 consults and 373 urologic emergencies. We observed not only a 22% decrease in urologic presentations to the ED compared to corresponding months in 2019, but also a 54% decrease in the proportion of urologic presentations that were truly emergent. For patients with emergent diagnoses, April 2020 saw an increase in Medicare/Medicaid coverage and a decrease in private insurance, May 2020 saw a decreased travel distance from home to the ED, and March and May 2020 saw an increase in patients who had previously seen a health system provider outside of the ED. No changes were seen in demographic characteristics or CCI. CONCLUSIONS During the early COVID-19 pandemic, urologic emergencies within a single health system decreased by 54% compared to the corresponding months pre-pandemic.

The results of chest computed tomography (CT) scan, and antibody rapid test were compared in EMS personnel with confirmed COVID-19, as well as symptomatic and asymptomatic ones who had exposure to a probable/confirmed COVID-19 teammate. In symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals who were only IgM-positive, chest CT scan or RT-PCR was recommended. Results A total of 243 EMS personnel with the mean age of 36.14±8.70 (range 21 to 59) years took part in this study (87.7% were males). Most of the participants (73.3%) had history of exposure. One hundred sixty-three EMS personnel were tested using either RT-PCR test or chest CT-scan or both, and 78 (47.9%) of them had at least one positive result. Among the participants who had undergone chest CT-scan and/or RT-PCR test (n=163), 78 had positive chest CT-scan and/or RT-PCR test; of these, 18 individuals had negative results for IgM and IgG. The rate of positive IgM and IgG in participants with positive chest CT-scan was 1.6 or 1.3 times more than those with negative chest CT-scan, respectively (p < 0.05). The percentage of positive results for both IgM and IgG in participants having positive RT-PCR test was 1.7 times more than those having negative RT-PCR test (p < 0.05). Conclusion Rapid antibody test could help in diagnosis of COVID-19 in asymptomatic or symptomatic EMS personnel who did not undergo RT-PCR test or the test was reported as negative. However, its sensitivity could be enhanced through use along with other diagnostic methods.","Saberian, Peyman; Mireskandari, Seyed Mohammad; Baratloo, Alireza; Hasani-Sharamin, Parisa; Babaniamansour, Sepideh; Aliniagerdroudbari, Ehsan; Jamshididana, Mahnaz",Archives of academic emergency medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33313569/,354
196441,Promoting effects of Chinese pangolin and wild pink medicines on the mammary gland development in immature mice.,2009,"Neuroendocrine tumors (NET) are the rare tumors which often impose graveyard threat. These tumors are characterized by the over expression of various G-protein coupled receptors including cholecystokinin (CCK) receptors-1 and 2 (A or B). Minigastrin peptides are being investigated for theranostic purposes of CCK-2 receptor positive NET. The minigastrin analogue (APHO70) was modified by engineering enzyme susceptible tetrapeptide sequence into APHO70 peptide to reduce the random degradation by lysosome enzymes which pave the way to random trafficking in patient's body and dipeptide addition at c-terminus. All the four modified minigastrin peptides (MG-CL1-4) were investigated for lysosome cathepsin B (catB) enzyme susceptibility and fate into AR42J cancer cell line. The indium-111 labeled MG-CL1-4 peptides were also studied for target (tumor) and non-target saccumulation by using tumor induced mice. The RP-HPLC analysis result showed nonspecific cleavage of standard 111In-APH070 and 111In-MGCL1 while specific cleavage was noted in case of 111In-MGCL (2-4). The effect of specific and non-specific cleavage on biodistribution in tumor induced nude mice model indicates the promising accumulation of 111In-MGCL2, 111In-MGCL3, and 111In-MGCL4 radiotracers while 111In-MGCL1 showed less accumulation. 111In-MGCL2 and 111In-MGCL3 showed highest target-to-kidney ratio (T/K) i.e. 1.71 and 1.72, respectively whereas standard compound showed T/K 1.13. In conclusion, the two indium-111 labeled analogues i.e. 111In-MGCL2 and 111In-MGCL3 showed promising sensitivity for tumor andcould be tested for further investigation to reach pre-clinical studies.","Naqvi, Syed Ali Raza; Yameen, Muhammad; Hussain, Zaib; Asim, Sadia; Usman, Muhammad; Khan, Naeemul Haq; Abbas, Khizar",Pakistan journal of pharmaceutical sciences,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30587465/,354

The authors therefore investigated whether the course-of-illness parameters would define groups within atypical depression differing in brain laterality. Patients with atypical depression were assessed for illness course and brain laterality. Two patient groups were defined, 1 with onset prior to age 20 plus a very chronic course, and a 2nd group having later onset or less chronic illness. Patients reporting early onset of very chronic dysphoria showed significantly less right-ear (left-hemisphere) accuracy and also differed in characteristic perceptual asymmetry when compared to patients with later onset or less chronicity. Course of illness may usefully define more homogeneous depressive subgroups within atypical depression.","Stewart, Jonathan W; Bruder, Gerard E; McGrath, Patrick J; Quitkin, Frederic M",Journal of abnormal psychology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12784835/,354

214029,Preparing e-portfolio as an element of online training by clinical chemistry residents in the COVID-19 era,2021,"This paper presents a study of early epidemiological assessment of COVID-19 transmission dynamics in Indonesia. The aim is to quantify heterogeneity in the numbers of secondary infections. To this end, we estimate the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] and the overdispersion parameter [Formula: see text] at two regions in Indonesia: Jakarta-Depok and Batam. The method to estimate [Formula: see text] is based on a sequential Bayesian method, while the parameter [Formula: see text] is estimated by fitting the secondary case data with a negative binomial distribution. Based on the first 1288 confirmed cases collected from both regions, we find a high degree of individual-level variation in the transmission. The basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] is estimated at 6.79 and 2.47, while the overdispersion parameter [Formula: see text] of a negative-binomial distribution is estimated at 0.06 and 0.2 for Jakarta-Depok and Batam, respectively. This suggests that superspreading events played a key role in the early stage of the outbreak, i.e., a small number of infected individuals are responsible for large numbers of COVID-19 transmission. This finding can be used to determine effective public measures, such as rapid isolation and identification, which are critical since delay of diagnosis is the most common cause of superspreading events.","Hasan, Agus; Susanto, Hadi; Kasim, Muhammad Firmansyah; Nuraini, Nuning; Lestari, Bony; Triany, Dessy; Widyastuti, Widyastuti",Sci Rep,,354
218166,Understanding the impact of isolation due to COVID-19 on employment for Kentuckians with spinal cord injuries,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Adipose tissue plays a role in the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), a unique visceral fat, presents with high degree of inflammation in severe COVID-19 disease. Whether and how adipose tissue may respond to the COVID-19 therapies is unknown. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the difference in computed tomography (CT) measured EAT and subcutaneous (SAT) attenuation, defined as mean attenuation expressed in Hounsfield units (HU), in 72 patients [mean±SD age was 59.6±12.4 years, 50 (69%) were men] at the hospital admission for COVID-19 and 99 days [IQR (71-129)] after discharge. RESULTS: At the admission, EAT HU was significantly correlated with blood glucose levels, interleukin 6 , troponin T levels and waist circumference. EAT HU decreased from -87.21±16.18 to -100.0±11 (p<0.001) whereas SAT HU did not change (-110.21±12.1 to -111.11±27.82, p=0.78) after therapy. Changes in EAT HU (expressed as &#8710;) significantly correlated with dexamethasone therapy (r= - 0.46, p= 0.006), and when dexamethasone was combined with tocilizumab (r= -0.24, p=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Dexamethasone therapy was associated with significant reduction of EAT inflammation in COVID-19 patients, whereas SAT showed no changes. Anti-inflammatory therapies targeting visceral fat may be helpful in COVID-19 diseases.","Iacobellis, Gianluca; Malavazos, Alexis Elias; Basilico, Sara; Tresoldi, Silvia; Rinaldo, Rocco Francesco; Dubini, Carola; Capitanio, Gloria; Serpi, Francesca; Schiaffino, Simone; Oliva, Omar Alessandro; Cariati, Maurizio; Morricone, Lelio; Centanni, Stefano; Sardanelli, Francesco; Carruba, Michele; Corsi Romanelli, Massimiliano Marco; Secchi, Francesco",Obesity (Silver Spring),,354

231563,Single- versus Dual-Ion Conductors for Electric Double Layer Gating: Finite Element Modeling and Hall-Effect Measurements,2020,"This study develops a mathematical model to mitigate disruptions in a three-stage (i.e., supplier, manufacturer, retailer) supply chain network subject to a natural disaster like COVID-19 pandemic. This optimization model aims to manage supply chain disruptions for a pandemic situation where disruptions can occur to both the supplier and the retailer. This study proposes an inventory policy using the renewal reward theory for maximizing profit for the manufacturer under study. Tested using two heuristics algorithms, namely the genetic algorithm (GA) and pattern search (PS), the proposed inventory-based disruption risk mitigation model provides the manufacturer with an optimum decision to maximize profits in a production cycle. A sensitivity analysis was offered to ensure the applicability of the model in practical settings. Results reveal that the PS algorithm performed better for such model than a heuristic method like GA. The ordering quantity and reordering point were also lower in PS than GA. Overall, it was evident that PS is more suited for this problem. Supply chain managers need to employ appropriate inventory policies to deal with several uncertain conditions, for example, uncertainties arising due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This model can help managers establish and redesign an inventory policy to maximize the profit by considering probable disruptions in the supply chain network.","Shahed, Kazi Safowan; Azeem, Abdullahil; Ali, Syed Mithun; Moktadir, Md Abdul",,,354

In this article, I develop three propositions. First, I identify trust studies as a rich interdisciplinary field, linking communication to other branches of the social sciences and humanities. Second, I argue that we lack a comprehensive account of how trust has been understood in communication, and that doing so requires integrating macro-societal approaches with the ""meso"" level of institutions, and the ""micro"" level of interpersonal communication. Third, I propose that a focus upon trust would open up new perspectives on two important topics-the future of news media and journalism, and the global rise of populism.","Flew, T.",Journal of Communication,,354

Indeed, most studies thus far have focused on the risk of increase and aggravation of other psychiatric disorders as a consequence of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Yet, risk of onset or aggravation of panic disorder, especially the subtype with prominent respiratory symptoms, which is characterized by a fear response conditioning to interoceptive sensations (e.g., respiratory), and hypervigilance to these interoceptive signals, could be expected in the current situation. Indeed, respiratory symptoms, such as coughs and dyspnea, are among the most commonly associated with the SARS-CoV-2 (59-82% and 31-55%, respectively), and respiratory symptoms are associated with a poor illness prognosis. Hence given that some etiological and maintenance factors associated with panic disorder - i.e., fear conditioning to abnormal breathing patterns attributable or not to the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), as well as hypervigilance towards breathing abnormalities - are supposedly more prevalent, one could expect an increased risk of panic disorder onset or aggravation following the COVID-19 epidemic in people who were affected by the virus, but also those who were not. In people with the comorbidity (i.e., panic disorder or panic attacks and the COVID-19), it is particularly important to be aware of the risk of hypokalemia in specific at-risk situations or prescriptions. For instance, in the case of salbutamol prescription, which might be overly used in patients with anxiety disorders and COVID-19, or in patients presenting with diarrhea and vomiting. Hypokalemia is associated with an increased risk of torsade de pointe, thus caution is required when prescribing specific psychotropic drugs, such as the antidepressants citalopram and escitalopram, which are first-line treatments for panic disorder, but also hydroxyzine, aiming at anxiety reduction. The results reviewed here highlight the importance of considering and further investigating the impact of the current pandemic on the diagnosis and treatment of panic disorder (alone or comorbid with the COVID-19).","Javelot, H; Weiner, L",Encephale,,354

These disruptions will alter the way we work, where we work, and will be further affected by the changing demographic characteristics and level of training of the available workforce. These changes will likely result in scenarios where existing workplace hazards are exacerbated and new hazards with unknown health effects are created. The pace of these changes heralds an urgent need for a proactive approach to understand the potential effects new and emerging workplace hazards will have on worker health, safety, and well-being. As employers increasingly rely on non-standard work arrangements, research is needed to better understand the work organization and employment models that best support decent work and improved worker health, safety, and well-being. This need has been made more acute by the SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic that has resulted in dramatic changes in employment patterns, millions of lost jobs, an erosion of many economic sectors, and widespread disparities which further challenge occupational safety and health (OSH) systems to ensure a healthy and productive workplace. To help identify new research approaches to address OSH challenges in the future, a virtual workshop was organized in June 2020 with leading experts in the fields of OSH, well-being, research methods, mental health, economics, and life-course analysis. A paradigm shift will be needed for OSH research in the future of work that embraces key stakeholders and thinks differently about research that will improve lives of workers and enhance enterprise success. A more transdisciplinary approach to research will be needed that integrates the skills of traditional and non-traditional OSH research disciplines, as well as broader research methods that support the transdisciplinary character of an expanded OSH paradigm.

There has been a surge in demand for COVID-19 diagnostic reagents, as timely detection of virus carriers is one of the most important components of disease prevention and control. Nucleic acid testing (NAT), with high sensitivity and specificity, is considered the ""gold standard"" for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Therefore, more than 700 research units and companies have been devoted to developing NAT reagents. To date, nearly 600 research units and companies have claimed to have completed the development of NAT reagents. The use of these products has a positive effect on disease prevention and control; however, exaggerated claims and inadequate understanding of the products have led to improper access to reagents and equipment in clinics.

On the one hand, this growth poses challenges to access providers (APs), who have to upgrade their infrastructure to meet the growing traffic demands as well as find new ways to monetize their network resources. On the other hand, despite numerous optimizations of the underlying transport protocol, a user's utilization of network bandwidth and is thus the user's perceived quality still being largely affected by network latency and buffer size. To address both concerns, we propose DiffPerf, a class-based differentiation framework, that, at a macroscopic level dynamically allocates bandwidth to service classes pre-defined by the APs, and at a microscopic level statistically differentiates and isolates user flows to help them achieve better performance. We implement DiffPerf on OpenDaylight SDN controller and programmable Barefoot Tofino switch and evaluate it from an application perspective for MPEG-DASH video streaming. Our evaluations demonstrate the practicality and flexibility that DiffPerf provides APs with capabilities through which a spectrum of qualities are provisioned at multiple classes. Meanwhile, it assists in achieving better fairness and improving overall user's perceived quality within the same class.","Aljoby, Walid; Wang, Xin; Divakaran, Dinil Mon; Fu, Tom Z.

We aimed to describe clinical features and outcomes of severe COVID-19 patients with co-infection of influenza virus. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study was performed and a total of 140 patients with severe COVID-19 were enrolled in designated wards of Sino-French New City Branch of Tongji Hospital between Feb 8th and March 15th in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China. The demographic, clinical features, laboratory indices, treatment and outcomes of these patients were collected. RESULTS: Of 140 severe COVID-19 hospitalized patients, including 73 patients (52.14%) with median age 62 years were influenza virus IgM-positive and 67 patients (47.86%) with median age 66 years were influenza virus IgM-negative. 76 (54.4%) of severe COVID-19 patients were males. Chronic comorbidities consisting mainly of hypertension (45.3%), diabetes (15.8%), chronic respiratory disease (7.2%), cardiovascular disease (5.8%), malignancy (4.3%) and chronic kidney disease (2.2%). Clinical features, including fever (&#8805;38 °C), chill, cough, chest pain, dyspnea, diarrhea and fatigue or myalgia were collected. Fatigue or myalgia was less found in COVID-19 patients with IgM-positive (33.3% vs 50/7%, P = 0.0375). Higher proportion of prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) > 42 s was observed in COVID-19 patients with influenza virus IgM-negative (43.8% vs 23.6%, P = 0.0127). Severe COVID-19 Patients with influenza virus IgM positive have a higher cumulative survivor rate than that of patients with influenza virus IgM negative (Log-rank P = 0.0308). Considering age is a potential confounding variable, difference in age was adjusted between different influenza virus IgM status groups, the HR was 0.29 (95% CI, 0.081-1.100). Similarly, difference in gender was adjusted as above, the HR was 0.262 (95% CI, 0.072-0.952) in the COX regression model. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza virus IgM positive may be associated with decreasing in-hospital death.","Tong, Xunliang; Xu, Xiaomao; Lv, Guoyue; Wang, He; Cheng, Anqi; Wang, Dingyi; Fan, Guohui; Zhang, Yue; Li, Yanming",BMC Infect Dis,,354

This study aimed at investigating the global prevalence, biological and clinical characteristics of novel coronavirus, Wuhan China (2019-nCoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection outbreaks. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The data on the global outbreak of ""2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV"" were obtained from World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), concerned ministries and research institutes. We also recorded the information from research documents published in global scientific journals indexed in ISI Web of Science and research centers on the prevalence, biological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. RESULTS: Worldwide, SARS-CoV involved 32 countries, with 8422 confirmed cases and 916 (10.87%) casualties from November 2002 to August 2003. MERS-CoV spread over 27 states, causing 2496 cases and 868 (34.77%) fatalities during the period April 2012 to December 2019. However, the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV spread swiftly the global borders of 27 countries. It infected 34799 people and resulted in 724 (2.08%) casualties during the period December 29, 2019 to February 7, 2020. The fatality rate of coronavirus MERS-CoV was (34.77%) higher than SARS-CoV (10.87%) and 2019-nCoV (2.08%); however, the 2019-nCoV transmitted rapidly in comparison to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. CONCLUSIONS: The novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV has diverse epidemiological and biological characteristics, making it more contagious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. It has affected more people in a short time period compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, although the fatality rate of MERS-CoV was higher than SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV. The major clinical manifestations in coronavirus infections 2019-nCoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS CoV are fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, generalized myalgia, malaise, drowsy, diarrhea, confusion, dyspnea, and pneumonia. Global health authorities should take immediate measures to prevent the outbreaks of such emerging and reemerging pathogens across the globe to minimize the disease burden locally and globally.","Meo, S A; Alhowikan, A M; Al-Khlaiwi, T; Meo, I M; Halepoto, D M; Iqbal, M; Usmani, A M; Hajjar, W; Ahmed, N",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,354

355890,Neurologic complications of coronavirus infections,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of the national lockdown because of the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic towards the ED visits and admission rates in Thailand. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the electronic medical database of patients presenting to the ED during the national lockdown period (from 26 March to 30 June 2020). We used the same time interval in the year 2019 as the control period in our analysis. We collected baseline characteristics and outcomes of each patient in the ED. The primary outcome was the incidence rate ratio (IRR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of the average daily ED visits. Secondary outcomes included the IRR with 95% CI of total admissions and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. RESULTS: The average number of daily ED visits decreased significantly from 89.1 to 57.0 (-36.0%, IRR 0.69, 95% CI 0.67-0.70). However, the proportions of 'Resuscitation' and 'Emergency' triage level were increased (29.1% vs 19.2%, P < 0.001). Total ED admission rate and ICU admission rate were also increased (33.5% vs 28.3%, P < 0.001 and 10.2% vs 7.5%, P < 0.001, respectively). The IRR for the admission rate was 1.18 (95% CI 1.11-1.26), and the IRR for the ICU admission rate was 1.35 (95% CI 1.21-1.52). CONCLUSION: The national lockdown in Thailand was associated with a significant reduction in average daily ED visits across traumatic and non-traumatic patients. Communication from healthcare professionals and public health officers is necessary to reinforce the importance of timely ED visits for acute health conditions.","Wongtanasarasin, Wachira; Srisawang, Thanchanok; Yothiya, Wanwisa; Phinyo, Phichayut",Emerg. med Australas,,354

However, the susceptibility of the brain to SARS-CoV-2, and the mechanisms underlying neurological infection are still elusive. Here, we utilized human embryonic stem cell-derived brain organoids and monolayer cortical neurons to investigate infection of brain with pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 viral particles. Spike-containing SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infected neural layers within brain organoids. The expression of ACE2, a host cell receptor for SARS-CoV-2, was sustained during the development of brain organoids, especially in the somas of mature neurons, while remaining rare in neural stem cells. However, pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 was observed in the axon of neurons, which lack ACE2. Neural infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus did not increase in proportion to viral load, but only 10% of neurons were infected. Our findings demonstrate that brain organoids provide a useful model for investigating SARS-CoV-2 entry into the human brain and elucidating the susceptibility of the brain to SARS-CoV-2.","Yi, Sang Ah; Nam, Ki Hong; Yun, Jihye; Gim, Dongmin; Joe, Daeho; Kim, Yong Ho; Kim, Han-Joo; Han, Jeung-Whan; Lee, Jaecheol",Viruses,,354

Precision medicine focuses on individual-level disease treatment and prevention. Here, we propose the usage of the term 'precision omics' to represent the combinatorial strategy that applies omics to translate large-scale molecular omics data for precision disease understanding and accurate disease diagnosis, treatment and prevention. Given the complexity of both omics and precision medicine, precision omics requires standardized representation and integration of heterogeneous data types. Ontology has emerged as an important artificial intelligence component to become critical for standard data and metadata representation, standardization and integration. To support precision omics, we propose a precision omics ontology hypothesis, which hypothesizes that the effectiveness of precision omics is positively correlated with the interoperability of ontologies used for data and knowledge integration. Therefore, to make effective precision omics studies, interoperable ontologies are required to standardize and incorporate heterogeneous data and knowledge in a human- and computer-interpretable manner. Methods for efficient development and application of interoperable ontologies are proposed and illustrated. With the interoperable omics data and knowledge, omics tools such as OmicsViz can also be evolved to process, integrate, visualize and analyze various omics data, leading to the identification of new knowledge and hypotheses of molecular mechanisms underlying the outcomes of diseases such as COVID-19. Given extensive COVID-19 omics research, we propose the strategy of precision omics supported by interoperable ontologies, accompanied with ontology-based semantic reasoning and machine learning, leading to systematic disease mechanism understanding and rational design of precision treatment and prevention. SHORT ABSTRACT: Precision medicine focuses on individual-level disease treatment and prevention. Precision omics is a new strategy that applies omics for precision medicine research, which requires standardized representation and integration of individual genetics and phenotypes, experimental conditions, and data analysis settings. Ontology has emerged as an important artificial intelligence component to become critical for standard data and metadata representation, standardization and integration. To support precision omics, interoperable ontologies are required in order to standardize and incorporate heterogeneous data and knowledge in a human- and computer-interpretable manner. With the interoperable omics data and knowledge, omics tools such as OmicsViz can also be evolved to process, integrate, visualize and analyze various omics data, leading to the identification of new knowledge and hypotheses of molecular mechanisms underlying disease outcomes.

Korea, with its remarkable Information and Communications Technology infrastructure, introduced telemedicine in 1988, yet it has not been formally accepted owing to stakeholders' resistance and legal restrictions. Purpose: This study aims to determine the feasibility of implementing the telemedicine system and find solutions of its development and resistance by stakeholders. Method and Material: The authors present a unique case of Korea where telemedicine, despite its solid technological base, has not yet gained a foothold 32 years after its first pilot project. A narrative review was condected according to the timeline of government-driven telemedicine adoption in Korea, and an analysis was performed on the tendency of stakeholder resistance. Results: The analysis revealed that the relevant stakeholders were classified into doctors, patients, governments and some political parties. Among stakeholders as a whole, private healthcare physicians, who provide over 90% of primary care in Korea, amount to the largest demographic against the implementation of telemedicine. Their resistance was found to be the product of policies and problems arising from the coexistence of telemedicine and conventional healthcare regimes. With the COVID-19 pandemic, policymakers are at odds with these stakeholders while implementing a pilot project. Conclusion: Fostering smooth policy implementation necessitates adopting an approach that reduces conflicts with private healthcare providers.","Kim, Ah Young; Choi, Woo Seok",Telemed. j. e. health,,354

METHODS: Cross-sectional data were from the COVID-19 Pandemic Adjustment Survey (CPAS, N = 2365 parents of a child 0-18 years, 8-28th April 2020); and a pre-pandemic national database containing 18 years of annual surveys collected in 2002-2019 (N = 17,529 parents). RESULTS: Levels of subjective wellbeing during the pandemic were considerably lower than ratings prior to the pandemic (Personal Wellbeing Index, mean[SD] = 65.3 [17.0]; compared to [SD] = 75.8 [11.9], p < 0.001). During the pandemic, lower subjective wellbeing was associated with low education (adjusted regression coefficient, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = -5.19, -0.93), language other-than-English (95% CI = -7.22, -1.30), government benefit (95% CI = -6.99, -0.96), single parents (95% CI = -8.84, -4.59), child neurodevelopmental condition (95% CI = -3.44, -0.76), parent physical/mental health problems (95% CI = -3.23, -0.67), COVID-environmental stressors (95% CI = -3.48, -2.44), and fear/worry about COVID-19 (95% CI = -8.13, -5.96). Unexpectedly, parent engagement with news media about the pandemic was associated with higher subjective wellbeing (95% CI = 0.35, 1.61). CONCLUSION: Subjective wellbeing in parents raising children aged 0-18 years appears to be disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and restrictions in Australia. Specific at-risk groups, for which government intervention may be warranted, include parents in socially disadvantaged contexts, parents with pre-existing mental health difficulties, and parents facing significant COVID-19-related work changes.","Westrupp, Elizabeth M; Stokes, Mark A; Fuller-Tyszkiewicz, Matthew; Berkowitz, Tomer S; Capic, Tanja; Khor, Sarah; Greenwood, Christopher J; Mikocka-Walus, Antonina; Sciberras, Emma; Youssef, George J; Olsson, Craig A; Hutchinson, Delyse",J Psychosom Res,,354

The present study aimed to investigate the antioxidant, cytotoxic, genotoxic, and chemopreventive effects of LicoA in in vitro and in vivo systems. The results showed that LicoA (197.1 µM) scavenged 77.92% of free radicals. Concentrations of 147.75 µM or higher LicoA produced cytotoxicity in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) fibroblasts. LicoA treatments of 4.43 to 10.34 µM did not exert genotoxic activity, but at 11.8 µM significantly lowered nuclear division indexes, compared to negative control, revealing cytotoxicity. Lower concentrations (1.85 to 7.39 µM) exhibited protective activity against chromosomal damage induced by doxorubicin (DXR) or methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) in CHO cells. LicoA exerted no marked influence on DXR-induced genotoxicity in mouse erythrocytes, but reduced pre-neoplastic lesions induced by 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) in rat colon at 3.12 to 50 mg/kg b.w.

367125,The effects of myelin on macrophage activation are phenotypic specific via cPLA2 in the context of spinal cord injury inflammation,2021,"High quantities of quality RNA are necessary for many veterinary laboratory tests. Several commercial kits are available for RNA isolation from human whole blood; their resultant RNA yield and purity have not been reported for canine whole blood, to our knowledge. We assessed the performance of 4 RNA extraction kits (RiboPure, TRIzol, RNeasy Protect animal blood, and QIAamp RNA blood mini). Whole blood from a healthy dog was stored in the manufacturer-recommended RNA stabilizing buffer as directed. RNA isolation, including DNase treatment, was performed using each kit's manufacturer's protocol. Resultant RNA yield and purity were evaluated using spectrophotometric absorbance, capillary electrophoresis and electropherogram analysis, and a reverse-transcription real-time PCR (RT-rtPCR) assay. The RNeasy Protect animal blood kit extracted the highest, and RiboPure the lowest, concentration of nucleic acid. RNA integrity numbers classified extracted RNA as good quality or better for all kits except RNeasy Protect. All kits had evidence of genomic DNA contamination as assessed by RT-rtPCR. Overall, QIAamp RNA blood mini kit and TRIzol optimized both RNA yield and purity from canine whole blood. These kits extracted high quantities of good quality RNA as evidenced by high RNA integrity numbers and minimal contamination with proteins and solvents.","Tesfamichael, Dahlia H; Wood, Michael W; Pritchard, Jessica C",J Vet Diagn Invest,,354
367738,Mechanical behavior and phase change of alkali-silica reaction products under hydrostatic compression,2020,"BACKGROUND: The use of high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and noninvasive ventilation (NIV) in patients with COVID-19 is debated. METHODS: This study was performed in four hospitals of China from January to March 2020. We retrospectively enrolled 23 and 13 COVID-19 patients who used HFNC and NIV as first-line therapy, respectively. RESULTS: Among the 23 patients who used HFNC as first-line therapy, 10 experienced HFNC failure and used NIV as rescue therapy. Among the 13 patients who used NIV as first-line therapy, one (8%) used HFNC as rescue therapy due to NIV intolerance. The duration of HFNC + NIV (median 7.1, IQR: 3.5-12.2 vs. 7.3, IQR: 5.3-10.0 days), intubation rate (17% vs. 15%) and mortality (4% vs. 8%) did not differ between patients who used HFNC and NIV as first-line therapy. In total cohorts, 6 (17%) patients received intubation. Time from initiation of HFNC or NIV to intubation was 8.4 days (IQR: 4.4-18.5). And the time from initiation of HFNC or NIV to termination in patients without intubation was 7.1 days (IQR: 3.9-10.3). Among all the patients, C-reactive protein was independently associated with intubation (OR = 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01-1.07). In addition, no medical staff got nosocomial infection who participated in HFNC and NIV management. CONCLUSIONS: In critically ill patients with COVID-19 who used HFNC and NIV as first-line therapy, the duration of HFNC + NIV, intubation rate and mortality did not differ between two groups. And no medical staff got nosocomial infection during this study.","Duan, Jun; Chen, Baixu; Liu, Xiaoyi; Shu, Weiwei; Zhao, Wei; Li, Ji; Li, Yishi; Hong, Yueling; Pan, Longfang; Wang, Ke",Am. j. emerg. med,,354

401950,Brainstem auditory evoked responses and bone conduction assessment in alpacas,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Rigid multiplanar thoracolumbar adult spinal deformity (ASD) cases are challenging and many require a 3-column osteotomy (3CO), specifically asymmetrical pedicle subtraction osteotomy (APSO). The outcomes and additional risks of performing APSO for the correction of concurrent sagittal-coronal deformity have yet to be adequately studied. METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective review of all ASD patients who underwent 3CO during the period from 2006 to 2019. All cases involved either isolated sagittal deformity (patients underwent standard PSO) or concurrent sagittal-coronal deformity (coronal vertical axis [CVA] &#8805; 4.0 cm; patients underwent APSO). Perioperative and 2-year follow-up outcomes were compared between patients with isolated sagittal imbalance who underwent PSO and those with concurrent sagittal-coronal imbalance who underwent APSO. RESULTS: A total of 390 patients were included: 338 who underwent PSO and 52 who underwent APSO. The mean patient age was 64.6 years, and 65.1% of patients were female. APSO patients required significantly more fusions with upper instrumented vertebrae (UIV) in the upper thoracic spine (63.5% vs 43.3%, p = 0.007). Radiographically, APSO patients had greater deformity with more severe preoperative sagittal and coronal imbalance: sagittal vertical axis (SVA) 13.0 versus 10.7 cm (p = 0.042) and CVA 6.1 versus 1.2 cm (p < 0.001). In APSO cases, significant correction and normalization were achieved (SVA 13.0-3.1 cm, CVA 6.1-2.0 cm, lumbar lordosis [LL] 26.3°-49.4°, pelvic tilt [PT] 38.0°-20.4°, and scoliosis 25.0°-10.4°, p < 0.001). The overall perioperative complication rate was 34.9%. There were no significant differences between PSO and APSO patients in rates of complications (overall 33.7% vs 42.3%, p = 0.227; neurological 5.9% vs 3.9%, p = 0.547; medical 20.7% vs 25.0%, p = 0.482; and surgical 6.5% vs 11.5%, p = 0.191, respectively). However, the APSO group required significantly longer stays in the ICU (3.1 vs 2.3 days, p = 0.047) and hospital (10.8 vs 8.3 days, p = 0.002). At the 2-year follow-up, there were no significant differences in mechanical complications, including proximal junctional kyphosis (p = 0.352), pseudarthrosis (p = 0.980), rod fracture (p = 0.852), and reoperation (p = 0.600). CONCLUSIONS: ASD patients with significant coronal imbalance often have severe concurrent sagittal deformity. APSO is a powerful and effective technique to achieve multiplanar correction without higher risk of morbidity and complications compared with PSO for sagittal imbalance. However, APSO is associated with slightly longer ICU and hospital stays.","Lau, Darryl; Haddad, Alexander F; Deviren, Vedat; Ames, Christopher P",J Neurosurg Spine,,354

Our method colorizes a whole page (not a single panel) semi-automatically, with the same color for the same character across multiple panels. To colorize the target character by the color from the reference image, we extract a color feature from the reference and feed it to the colorization network to help the colorization. Our approach employs adversarial loss to encourage the effect of the color features. Optionally, our tool allows users to revise the colorization result interactively.

Methods: Retrospective observational cohort of consecutive adults evaluated in the emergency department and/or admitted with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) across 31 hospitals in 4 countries (2/1/2020 - 06/16/2020). The primary outcome was the incidence rate of cerebrovascular events, inclusive of acute ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhages (ICH), and cortical vein and/or sinus thrombosis (CVST). Results: Of the 14,483 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2, 172 were diagnosed with an acute cerebrovascular event (1.13% of cohort;1130/100,000 patients, 95%CI 970- 1320/100,000), 68/171 (40.5%) of whom were female and 96/172 (55.8%) were between the ages 60-79 years. Of these, 156 had acute ischemic stroke (1.08%;1080/100,000 95%CI 920- 1260/100,000), 28 ICH (0.19%;190/100,000 95%CI 130 - 280/100,000) and 3 with CVST (0.02%;20/100,000, 95%CI 4-60/100,000). The in-hospital mortality rate for SARS-CoV-2-associated stroke was 38.1% and for ICH 58.3%. After adjusting for clustering by site and age, baseline strokeseverity, and all predictors of in-hospital mortality found in univariate regression (p&lt;0.1: male sex,tobacco use, arrival by emergency medical services, lower platelet and lymphocyte counts, andintracranial occlusion), cryptogenic stroke mechanism (aOR 5.01, 95%CI 1.63-15.44, p&lt;0.01), olderage (aOR 1.78, 95%CI 1.07-2.94, p=0.03), and lower lymphocyte count on admission (aOR 0.58,95%CI 0.34-0.98 p=0.04) were the only independent predictors of mortality among patients withstroke and COVID-19. Conclusions: COVID-19 is associated with a small but significant risk of clinically relevantcerebrovascular events, particularly ischemic stroke. The mortality rate is high for COVID-19associated cerebrovascular complications, therefore aggressive monitoring and early interventionshould be pursued to mitigate poor outcomes.","Siegler, J.

While not exhaustive, this review's goal is to add to the body of literature available on this topic and give interventional providers and practitioners an additional resource to consider when performing procedures. RECENT FINDINGS: In the current SARS-CoV2 epidemiological environment, infection control and costs associated with healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are of paramount importance. Even before the onset of SARS-CoV2, HAIs affected nearly 2million patients a year in the USA and resulted in nearly 90,000 deaths, all of which resulted in a cost to hospitals ranging from US$28 billion to 45 billion. The onset SARS-CoV2, though not spread by an airborne route, has heightened infection control protocols in hospitals and, as such, cast a renewed focus on disinfectants and their utility across different settings and organisms. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of disinfectants used in the inpatient setting.","Aranke, Mayank; Moheimani, Roya; Phuphanich, Melissa; Kaye, Alan D; Ngo, Anh L; Viswanath, Omar; Herman, Jared",Curr Pain Headache Rep,,354

In the present study, the neuroprotective role of DEX on cerebral ischemic injury and the underlining signaling mechanisms were explored. In order to simulate cerebral ischemic injury, we performed middle cerebral artery occlusion in mice and oxygen-glucose deprivation in neurons. Immunohistochemistry, Western blot analysis, and RT-qPCR were used to examine expression of HDAC5, NPAS4, MDM2, and PSD-95 in hippocampus tissues of MCAO mice and OGD-treated neurons. MCAO mice received treatment with DEX and sh-PSD-95, followed by neurological function evaluation, behavioral test, infarct volume detection by TTC staining, and apoptosis by TUNEL staining. Additionally, gain- and loss-of-function approaches were conducted in OGD-treated neuron after DEX treatment. Cell viability and apoptosis were assessed with the application of CCK-8 and flow cytometry. The interaction between MDM2 and PSD-95 was evaluated using Co-IP assay, followed by ubiquitination of PSD-95 detection. As per the results, HDAC5 and MDM2 were abundantly expressed, while NPAS4 and PSD-95 were poorly expressed in hippocampus tissues of MCAO mice and OGD-treated neurons. DEX elevated viability, and reduced LDH leakage rate and apoptosis rate of OGD-treated neurons, which was reversed following the overexpression of HDAC5. Moreover, HDAC5 augmented MDM2 expression via NPAS4 inhibition. MDM2 induced PSD-95 ubiquitination and degradation. In MCAO mice, DEX improved neurological function and behaviors and decreased infarct volume and apoptosis, which was negated as a result of PSD-95 silencing. DEX plays a neuroprotective role against cerebral ischemic injury by disrupting MDM2-induced PSD-95 ubiquitination and degradation via HDAC5 and NPAS4.","Lv, Hu; Li, Ying; Cheng, Qian; Chen, Jiawei; Chen, Wei",Mol.

Renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) blockers enhance the expression of ACE2, the binding receptor of SARS-CoV-2, and can enhance viral infectivity. We aim to provide a pooled estimate of the effect of RAAS blockers on COVID-19 outcomes. Methods: A literature search was performed using MEDLINE/PubMed, Google Scholar and preprint servers. All clinical studies analyzing the effect of RAAS blockers on clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients were included in this study. Newcastle–Ottawa scale was used for quality assessment of studies. MOOSE checklist was followed. Mortality and severity outcomes were recorded as pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) and level of heterogeneity (I2). Odds of mortality was the primary outcome. Odds of severity, hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation (MV), steroid use and acute kidney injury were the secondary outcomes. Severity outcomes were chosen depending upon the definition used by respective authors. Country-specific variations and effects of individual class of RAAS blockers were also explored. Results: In total 47 published studies were included in the final analysis, with a total of 26,432 patients from 31 studies in mortality analysis and 20,127 patients from 23 studies in severity analysis. No increased risk of mortality [Pooled OR 0.91 (0.65–1.26), I2 = 89%] or severity [Pooled OR 1.08 (0.79–1.46), I2 = 88%] was seen with RAAS blockers. The drug class was protective in hypertension [pooled OR 0.63 (0.46–0.86), I2 = 58%]. Severity of COVID-19 outcomes was high for Europeans [Pooled OR 2.08 (1.52–2.85), I2 = 77%] and US patients [Pooled OR 1.87 (1.62–2.17)]. Nearly 4 times higher risk of hospitalization and 2 times higher risk of ICU admission and MV were observed in US patients. Class-wise, angiotensin receptor blocker use was associated with 1.6 times higher odds of severity, mainly in Europeans. Conclusion: RAAS blockers are not associated with increased mortality in COVID-19 patients and should be continued in hypertensives. US and European patients are at higher risk of severe outcomes. Pharmacogenetic differences may explain the ethnicity-related variations. Plain language summary: Effect of RAAS-blocking medicines on COVID-19 Background and aims: Higher deaths have been observed in COVID-19 patients who have other long-term diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure. Many of these patients are prescribed a class of medicines called RAAS blockers (ramipril, telmisartan, etc). We studied whether the use of these medicines worsens the course of COVID-19 disease in these patients or causes excess deaths. Methods: We conducted a pooled analysis of 47 observational studies on the use of RAAS blocker drugs in COVID-19 patients. Results: We found that RAAS blockers do not cause excess deaths in patients with COVID-19. On the contrary, they have benefits if prescribed to those with high blood pressure. We also found that whereas European and US patients of COVID-19 taking these medicines had higher disease severity, this was not the case for Chinese patients. Conclusion: Theremay be some genetic and other factors responsible for differences by ethnicity.","Kaur, U.; Chakrabarti, S. S.; Patel, T. K.",Therapeutic Advances in Drug Safety,,354

504032,Reader response: Neurologic complications of coronavirus infections,2020,"Countries with abundant solar radiation have the potential to invest in simple technologies for deactivation of many bacteria and viruses in medical solid waste. In addition to the traditional Infection and Prevention Control (IPC) measures, these simple technologies contribute to better protection of health care workers in countries with compromised solid management schemes. Monitoring of temperature, relative humidity and ultraviolet inside containers soundly designed to collect disposal infectious waste illustrated to deactivate several viruses and bacteria. Casanova et al., 2010, used some surrogate viruses to overcome the challenges of working with SARS-CoV, concluded that by temperature above 40 °C most of viruses become below levels of detection after 90 min. Here we are proposing a model of a simple transparent container almost 200 L in volume that allow solar energy to be accumulated inside. In summer conditions in the testing site, temperature inside the container reached above 50 °C when the ambient air temperature was around 30 °C. The container was built using epoxy glass to guarantee maximum heat penetration. Actual temperature measurement inside the container was measured in real time against ambient air temperature. We present a mathematical model for predication of maximum temperature at different positions inside the container and their relation to different ambient air temperature scenarios. The mathematical formulas used are based on the conservation laws and a good agreement of a full month of field measurements were obtained. Even in winter conditions in many of developing countries air temperature can maintain levels above 20 °C, which will produce temperature around 30 °C and viruses can reach levels below detection limit in maximum 3 h.","Maher, Osama Ali; Kamal, Sherif A; Newir, Ahmed; Persson, Kenneth M",Int J Hyg Environ Health,,354
505971,Reader response: Neurologic complications of coronavirus infections,2020,"Importance: At the beginning of a public health crisis, such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, it is important to collect information about people's knowledge, worries, and behaviors to examine their influence on quality of life and to understand individual characteristics associated with these reactions. Such information could help to guide health authorities in providing informed interventions and clear communications. Objectives: To document the initial knowledge about COVID-19 and recommended health behaviors; to assess worries (ie, one's perception of the influence of the worries of others on oneself), social appraisal, and preventive behaviors, comparing respondents from areas under different movement restrictions during the first week after the outbreak; and to understand how worries, perceived risk, and preventive behaviors were associated with quality of life and individual characteristics among Italian adults. Design, Setting, and Participants: This convenience sample, nonprobablistic survey study recruited adult participants with a snowballing sampling method in any Italian region during the first week of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy from February 26, 2020, to March 4, 2020. Data were analyzed from March 5 to 12, 2020. Exposures: Information was collected from citizens living in the quarantine zone (ie, red zone), area with restricted movements (ie, yellow zone), and COVID-19-free regions (ie, green zone). Main Outcomes and Measures: Levels of knowledge on the virus, contagion-related worries, social appraisal, and preventive behaviors were assessed with ratings of quality of life (measured using the Short Form Health Survey). Additionally, some individual characteristics that may be associated with worries and behaviors were assessed, including demographic characteristics, personality traits (measured using Big Five Inventory-10), perceived health control (measured using the internal control measure in the Health Locus of Control scale), optimism (measured using the Revised Life Orientation Test), and the need for cognitive closure (measured using the Need for Closure Scale). Results: A total of 3109 individuals accessed the online questionnaire, and 2886 individuals responded to the questionnaire at least partially (mean [SD] age, 30.7 [13.2] years; 2203 [76.3%] women). Most participants were well informed about the virus characteristics and suggested behaviors, with a mean (SD) score of 77.4% (17.3%) correct answers. Quality of life was similar across the 3 zones (effect size = 0.02), but mental health was negatively associated with contagion-related worries (ß = -0.066), social appraisal (ß = -0.221), and preventive behaviors (ß = -0.066) in the yellow zone (R2 = 0.108). Social appraisal was also associated with reduced psychological well-being in the green zone (ß = -0.205; R2 = 0.121). In the yellow zone, higher worries were negatively correlated with emotional stability (ß = -0.165; R2 = 0.047). Emotional stability was also negatively associated with perceived susceptibility in the yellow (ß = -0.108; R2 = 0.040) and green (ß = -0.170; R2 = 0.087) zones. Preventative behaviors and social appraisal were also associated with the need for cognitive closure in both yellow (preventive behavior: ß = 0.110; R2 = 0.023; social appraisal ß = 0.115; R2 = 0.104) and green (preventive behavior: ß = 0.174; R2 = 0.022; social appraisal: 0.261; R2 = 0.137) zones. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that during the first week of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy, people were well informed and had a relatively stable level of worries. Quality of life did not vary across the areas, although mental well-being was challenged by the social appraisal and worries related to the contagion. Increased scores for worries and concerns were associated with more cognitive rigidity and emotional instability.","Pagnini, Francesco; Bonanomi, Andrea; Tagliabue, Semira; Balconi, Michela; Bertolotti, Mauro; Confalonieri, Emanuela; Di Dio, Cinzia; Gilli, Gabriella; Graffigna, Guendalina; Regalia, Camillo; Saita, Emanuela; Villani, Daniela",JAMA Netw Open,,354
513287,Human Vaccines & Immunotherapeutics: news,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has created profound challenges for health care systems worldwide. The exponential spread of COVID-19 has forced mental health providers to find new ways of providing mental health services that maintain physical distance and keeps providers and patients at home limiting possible exposure to the deadly virus. The pandemic has thus sparked a sudden interest in providing mental health services via telepsychotherapy (otherwise known as telehealth or telemedicine). Telepsychotherapy care has some inherent challenges that must always be mastered by providers to render effective care. Previous research and professional guidelines understandably note possible concerns about providing telepsychotherapy care to high-risk suicidal patients in a remote location. The coronavirus pandemic now poses all new ethical concerns about the routine practice of having an acutely suicidal patient go to an emergency department and/or admitting such patients to an inpatient psychiatric unit (if the public health goal is to limit the spread of this deadly virus). To this end, this article describes a pandemic-driven effort to rapidly provide support, guidance, and resources to providers around the world to use a suicide-focused and evidence-based intervention called the Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicidality (CAMS) within a telepsychotherapy modality. Additional suicide-relevant resources are being made available to provide further guidance and support to mental health professionals worldwide. In the midst of a global pandemic, there are emerging ways to help reduce further loss of life to suicide through the medium of telepsychotherapy to provide effective clinical care that is suicide-focused and evidence-based.","Jobes, David A.; Crumlish, Jennifer A.; Evans, Andrew D.",J.

In the case of multiple sclerosis, however, there is no such specific model able to provide an overview of the disease; multiple models covering the different pathophysiological features of the disease are therefore necessary. DEVELOPMENT: We reviewed the different in vitro and in vivo experimental models used in multiple sclerosis research. Concerning in vitro models, we analysed cell cultures and slice models. As for in vivo models, we examined such models of autoimmunity and inflammation as experimental allergic encephalitis in different animals and virus-induced demyelinating diseases. Furthermore, we analysed models of demyelination and remyelination, including chemical lesions caused by cuprizone, lysolecithin, and ethidium bromide; zebrafish; and transgenic models. CONCLUSIONS: Experimental models provide a deeper understanding of the different pathogenic mechanisms involved in multiple sclerosis. Choosing one model or another depends on the specific aims of the study.","Torre-Fuentes, L.; Moreno-Jiménez, L.; Pytel, V.; Matías-Guiu, J.A.; Gómez-Pinedo, U.; Matías-Guiu, J.",Neurologia,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0213485317302360; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0213485317302360,354

MIS-C can lead to myocardial dysfunction, heart failure, and multiorgan failure; the primary finding is hyperinflammation. Endothelial dysfunction has not been evaluated in patients with MIS-C. We investigated endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffness parameters in patients with MIS-C. The study included 38 pediatric patients (20 males and 18 females aged 4–17 years, mean age 8.89 years) with MIS-C. Thirty-eight age- and sex-matched healthy individuals were enrolled as the control group. Systolic and diastolic ventricular measurements and systolic and diastolic measurements of ascending aorta diameter were performed by M-mode echocardiography. Endothelial dysfunction was evaluated using flow-mediated dilation by measuring the brachial artery diameter with a high-resolution probe. The MIS-C group had lower flow-mediated dilation than did the controls. The MIS-C group had decreased aortic strain and aortic distensibility values and correlations between decreased flow-mediated dilation and reduced aortic strain, aortic distensibility, and reduced ejection fraction. Conclusion: The results show that patients with MIS-C had endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffness. Furthermore, the degree of endothelial dysfunction correlated with reduced ejection fractions. What is Known: •Endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffness are unknown in patients with MIS-C. •The effect of endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffness on decreased cardiac function is unknown. What is New: •MIS-C patients have endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffness. •There is a link between left ventricular dysfunction and reduced endothelial dysfunction in patients with MIS-C.","Çiftel, Murat; Ateş, Nurgül; Yılmaz, Osman",Eur J Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34212240/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00431-021-04136-6,354

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the therapeutic efficacy of ivermectin mucoadhesive nanosuspension intranasal spray in treatment of patients with mild COVID-19. METHODS: This clinical trial included 114 patients diagnosed as mild COVID-19. Patients were divided randomly into two age and sex-matched groups; group A comprising 57 patients received ivermectin nanosuspension nasal spray twice daily plus the Egyptian protocol of treatment for mild COVID-19 and group B comprising 57 patients received the Egyptian protocol for mild COVID-19 only. Evaluation of the patients was performed depending on improvement of presenting manifestations, negativity of two consecutive pharyngeal swabs for the COVID-19 nucleic acid via rRT-PCR and assessments of hematological and biochemical parameters in the form of complete blood counts, C-reactive protein, serum ferritin and d-dimer which were performed at presentation and 7 days later. RESULTS: Of the included patients confirmed with mild COVID-19, 82 were males (71.9%) and 32 females (28.1%) with mean age 45.1 ± 18.9. In group A, 54 patients (94.7%) achieved 2 consecutive negative PCR nasopharyngeal swabs in comparison to 43 patients (75.4%) in group B with P = 0.004. The durations of fever, cough, dyspnea and anosmia were significantly shorter in group A than group B, without significant difference regarding the duration of gastrointestinal symptoms. Duration taken for nasopharyngeal swab to be negative was significantly shorter in group A than in group B (8.3± 2.8 days versus 12.9 ± 4.3 days; P = 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Local use of ivermectin mucoadhesive nanosuspension nasal spray is safe and effective in treatment of patients with mild COVID-19 with rapid viral clearance and shortening the anosmia duration.

Data from two online studies (Study 1; N = 105 and Study 2; N = 336), using two self-report measures of therapists' defense mechanisms (Defense Style Questionnaire-40 in Study 1 and Defense Mechanism Rating Scales Self-Report-30 in Study 2), are presented. Therapists reported higher levels of mature defense mechanisms, and lower levels of immature defense mechanisms, compared to published community and clinical populations assessed before and during the pandemic. Therapists' lower level of mature defense mechanisms and higher levels of neurotic and immature defense mechanisms were related to higher concurrent levels of vicarious trauma and professional doubt. Therapists who reported higher levels of mature defense mechanisms at 3-month follow-up showed less vicarious trauma and professional self-doubt at follow-up, after controlling for these professional stressors at baseline. Implications for clinical supervision and training are discussed.

We hypothesised that differences in HLA genes might influence this variation. Using next generation sequencing, we analysed the class I and class II classical HLA genes of 147 individuals of European descent experiencing variable clinical outcomes following COVID‐19 infection. Forty‐nine of these patients were admitted to hospital with severe respiratory disease. They had no significant pre‐existing comorbidities. We compared the results to those obtained from a group of 69 asymptomatic hospital workers who evidence of COVID exposure based on blood antibody testing. Allele frequencies in both the severe and asymptomatic groups were compared to local and national healthy controls with adjustments made for age and sex. With the inclusion of hospital staff who had reported localised symptoms only (limited to loss of smell/taste, n = 13) or systemic symptoms not requiring hospital treatment (n = 16), we carried out ordinal logistic regression modelling to determine the relative influence of age, BMI, sex and the presence of specific HLA genes on symptomatology. We found a significant difference in the allele frequency of HLA‐DRB1*04:01 in the severe patient compared to the asymptomatic staff group (5.1% vs. 16.7%, P = .003 after adjustment for age and sex). There was a significantly lower frequency of the haplotype DQA1*01:01‐DQB1*05:01‐DRB1*01:01 in the asymptomatic group compared to the background population (P = .007). Ordinal logistic regression modelling confirmed the significant influence of DRB1*04:01 on the clinical severity of COVID‐19 observed in the cohorts. These alleles are found in greater frequencies in the North Western European population. This regional study provides evidence that HLA genotype influences clinical outcome in COVID‐19 infection. Validation studies must take account of the complex genetic architecture of the immune system across different geographies and ethnicities.","Langton, David J.; Bourke, Stephen C.; Lie, Benedicte A.; Reiff, Gabrielle; Natu, Shonali; Darlay, Rebecca; Burn, John; Echevarria, Carlos",HLA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33896121/; https://doi.org/10.1111/tan.14284,354

She developed multiple asymptomatic episodes of long sinus pauses as her oxygen requirements increased. These resolved without atropine and pacing as her respiratory status improved.

611405,Pathogen profiling for disease management and surveillance,2007-05-08,"Background: Other than its direct impact on cardiopulmonary health, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection affects additional body systems, especially in older adults. Several studies have reported acute neurological symptoms that present at onset or develop during hospitalisation, with associated neural injuries. Whilst the acute neurological phase is widely documented, the long-term consequences of COVID-19 infection on neurocognitive functioning remain unknown. Although an evidence-based framework describing the disease chronic phase is premature, it is important to lay the foundations for future data-driven models. This systematic review aimed at summarising the literature on neuroimaging and neuropathological findings in older over-60 patients with COVID-19 following a cognitive neuroscientific perspective, to clarify the most vulnerable brain areas and speculate on the possible cognitive consequences. Methods: PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched to identify relevant manuscripts published between 1st March 2020 and 31th December 2020. Outputs were screened and selected by two assessors. Relevant studies not detected by literature search were added manually. Results: Ninety studies, mainly single cases and case series, were included. Several neuroimaging and neuropathological findings in older patients with COVID-19 emerged from these studies, with cerebrovascular damage having a prominent role. Abnormalities (hyperintensities, hypoperfusion, inflammation, and cellular damage) were reported in most brain areas. The most consistent cross-aetiology findings were in white matter, brainstem and fronto-temporal areas. Viral DNA was detected mainly in olfactory, orbitofrontal and brainstem areas. Conclusion: Studies on COVID-19 related neural damage are rich and diverse, but limited to description of hospitalised patients with fatal outcome (i.e., in neuropathological studies) or severe symptoms (i.e., in neuroimaging studies). The damage seen in this population indicates acute and largely irreversible dysfunction to neural regions involved in major functional networks that support normal cognitive and behavioural functioning. It is still unknown whether the long-term impact of the virus will be limited to chronic evolution of acute events, whether sub-clinical pathological processes will be exacerbated or whether novel mechanisms will emerge. Based on current literature, future theoretical frameworks describing the long-term impact of COVID-19 infection on mental abilities will have to factor in major trends of aetiological and topographic heterogeneity.","Manca, Riccardo; De Marco, Matteo; Ince, Paul G.; Venneri, Annalena",Front Aging Neurosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34149394/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fnagi.2021.646908,354

These autoAb bound mainly to N- and C-terminal FAH peptides, the most reactive sequences being 1–50 and 390–420, respectively. Surprisingly, although FAH sequence 1–50 shares a high degree of homology with various MHV proteins, the C-terminal portion does not. Moreover, whereas the autoAb reacted with homologous peptides surrounding residues 70, 160 and 360, non-similar sequences around residues 130, 210, 240, 250, and 300 were also recognized, indicating that autoAb were not restricted to epitopes with sequence homologies. There was also a lack of correlation between the amount of anti-MHV or anti-FAH antibodies produced and the reactivity towards the peptides. Moreover, the spectrum of peptides recognized by the autoAb of a given mouse did not change significantly with time, which suggests that the MHV-elicited autoimmune response does not induce an epitope recognition spreading. Finally, anti-FAH Ab produced after immunization with rat liver FAH recognized essentially the same mouse FAH regions than autoAb from MHV-infected mice. Results indicated that the induction of the autoAb is not only related to molecular or structural mimicry, but rather supports the Danger model, in which any aggression, in this case the MHV infection, is susceptible to trigger the production of autoAb.","Duhalde-Vega, Maite; Loureiro, María E.; Mathieu, Patricia A.; Retegui, Lilia A.",J Autoimmun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17081731/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0896841106000783; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896841106000783,354
619899,The microbiome of bat guano: for what is this knowledge important?,2021-01-29,"Urtica dioica agglutinin (UDA) is a small plant monomeric lectin, 8.7 kDa in size, with an N-acetylglucosamine specificity that inhibits viruses from Nidovirales in vitro. In the current study, we first examined the efficacy of UDA on the replication of different SARS-CoV strains in Vero 76 cells. UDA inhibited virus replication in a dose-dependent manner and reduced virus yields of the Urbani strain by 90% at 1.1 ± 0.4 µg/ml in Vero 76 cells. Then, UDA was tested for efficacy in a lethal SARS-CoV-infected BALB/c mouse model. BALB/c mice were infected with two LD(50) (575 PFU) of virus for 4 hours before the mice were treated intraperitoneally with UDA at 20, 10, 5 or 0 mg/kg/day for 4 days. Treatment with UDA at 5 mg/kg significantly protected the mice against a lethal infection with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (p<0.001), but did not significantly reduce virus lung titers. All virus-infected mice receiving UDA treatments were also significantly protected against weight loss (p<0.001). UDA also effectively reduced lung pathology scores. At day 6 after virus exposure, all groups of mice receiving UDA had much lower lung weights than did the placebo-treated mice. Thus, our data suggest that UDA treatment of SARS infection in mice leads to a substantial therapeutic effect that protects mice against death and weight loss. Furthermore, the mode of action of UDA in vitro was further investigated using live SARS-CoV Urbani strain virus and retroviral particles pseudotyped with SARS-CoV spike (S). UDA specifically inhibited the replication of live SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV pseudotyped virus when added just before, but not after, adsorption. These data suggested that UDA likely inhibits SARS-CoV infection by targeting early stages of the replication cycle, namely, adsorption or penetration. In addition, we demonstrated that UDA neutralizes the virus infectivity, presumably by binding to the SARS-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein. Finally, the target molecule for inhibition of virus replication was partially characterized. When UDA was exposed to N-acetylglucosamine and then UDA was added to cells just prior to adsorption, UDA did not inhibit the virus infection. These data support the conclusion that UDA might bind to N-acetylglucosamine-like residues present on the glycosylated envelope glycoproteins, thereby preventing virus attachment to cells.","Kumaki, Yohichi; Wandersee, Miles K.; Smith, Aaron J.; Zhou, Yanchen; Simmons, Graham; Nelson, Nathan M.; Bailey, Kevin W.; Vest, Zachary G.; Li, Joseph K.-K.; Chan, Paul Kay-Sheung; Smee, Donald F.; Barnard, Dale L.",Antiviral Research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2011.02.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354211000313; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354211000313; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21338626/,354

This study aimed to explore nurses’ actions to protect their families from COVID-19 in Indonesia. This qualitative descriptive study included seventeen nurses who were chosen using the snowball sampling technique. The semi structured interviews explored nurses’ actions and behavior, and comparative analysis was performed to analyze the data. The study identified four themes: nurses modified their behavior and environments to protect their families, provided supplements and nutritious food, enhanced their families’ knowledge and awareness of COVID-19, and protected their families from social stigma. Nurses play active roles in the health of their family members. The government should support nurses in their roles so that they can remain healthy while caring for COVID-19 patients, and not transmit COVID-19 to their own families.","Widiasih, Restuning; Ermiati,; Emaliyawati, Etika; Hendrawati, Sri; Susanti, Raini Diah; Sutini, Titin; Sari, Citra Windani Mambang",Glob Qual Nurs Res,https://doi.org/10.1177/23333936211014851; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33997120/,354

In order to analyze the spreading of SARS-CoV-2 by statistical data based on the confirmed positive cases which are collected between December 31, 2019 to April 25, 2020. The present analysis reveals that the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in the major countries lie on the Equator is 78,509 cases, the countries lie on the Tropic of Cancer is 62,930 cases (excluding China) and the countries lie on the Tropic of Capricorn is 22,842 cases. The tropical countries, which comes between the Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn is reported to be 1,77,877 cases. The temperate zone countries, which are above and below the tropical countries are reported to be 25, 66,171 cases so, the pandemic analysis describes the correlation between latitude, temperate zones, PM(2.5) and local environmental factors. Hence, the temperature plays a pivotal role in the spreading of coronavirus at below 20 °C. The spreading of SARS-CoV-2 cases in Northern and Southern Hemispheres has inverse order against absorption of insolated energy. In temperate zone countries, the concentration of PM(2.5) at below 20 μg/m(3) has higher spreading rate of SARS-CoV-2 cases. The effect of insolation energy and PM(2.5), it is confirmed that the spreading of SARS-CoV-2 is explained by dumb-bell model and solid/liquid interface formation mechanism.

630199,Axonal neuropathy with unusual clinical course in young Snowshoe cats,2009-10-08,"Metabolism is a critical determinant of immune cell functionality. Immunometabolism, by definition, is a multidisciplinary area of immunology research that integrates the knowledge of energy transduction mechanisms and biochemical pathways. An important concept in the field is metabolic switch, a transition of immune cells upon activation to preferential utilization of select catabolic pathways for their energy needs. Mitochondria are not inert in this process and contribute to the metabolic adaptation by different mechanisms which include increasing ATP production to match dynamic bioenergetic demands and serving as a signaling platform. The latter involves generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), one of the most intensively studied mitochondrial processes. While the role of mitochondrial ROS in the context of oxidative stress is well established, ROS signaling in immunity is an emerging and quickly changing field. In this review, we discuss ROS signaling and immunometabolism concepts from the standpoint of bioenergetics. We also provide a critical insight into the methodology for ROS assessment, outlining current challenges in the field. Finally, based on our analysis of the literature data, we hypothesize that regulatory ROS production, as opposed to oxidative stress, is controlled by mitochondrial biogenesis rather than metabolic switches.","Andreyev, A.

A tele-mammography network could improve access to breast cancer screening decreasing its mortality. This research aims to conduct an economic evaluation of the implementation of a tele-mammography program to improve access to healthcare. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was performed to explore the incremental benefit of annual tele-mammography screening for at-risk Argentinian women over 40 years old. A Markov model was developed to simulate annual mammography or tele-mammography screening in two hypothetical population-based cohorts of asymptomatic women. Parameter uncertainty was evaluated through deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Model structure uncertainty was also explored to test the robustness of the results. RESULTS: It was estimated that 31 out of 100 new cases of breast cancer would be detected by mammography and 39/100 by tele-mammography. The model returned an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £26 051/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) which is lower than the WHO-recommended threshold of £26 288/QALY for Argentina. Deterministic sensitivity analysis showed the ICER is most sensitive to the uptake and sensitivity of the screening tests. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed tele-mammography is cost-effective in 59% of simulations. DISCUSSION: Tele-mammography should be considered for adoption as it could improve access to expertise in underserved areas where adherence to screening protocols is poor. Disaggregated data by province is needed for a better- informed policy decision. Telemedicine could also be beneficial in ensuring the continuity of care when health systems are under stress like in the current COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: There is a 59% chance that tele-mammography is cost-effective compared to mammography for at-risk Argentinian women over 40- years old, and should be adopted to improve access to healthcare in underserved areas of the country.","Malek Pascha, Victoria Alba; Sun, Li; Gilardino, Ramiro; Legood, Rosa",BMJ Health Care Inform,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34281995/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjhci-2021-100351,354

Simulation-based education (SBE) is an innovative addition to clinical experience which can begin to address the skills-based learning deficiency in order to help trainees meet their curriculum requirements and optimise the exposure required for a trainee to become a competent general urology consultant. Surgical simulation is an effective training tool but has a complex implementation process, requiring considerable planning tailored to specific educational targets, to ensure it is sustainable and reproducible. Methodology from the field of implementation science offers an invaluable approach to design an effective simulation-based training adjunct, as exemplified by the example of the UK Urology Simulation Boot Camp (USBC), a comprehensive training course which incorporates core technical and non-technical skills based on the current Joint Committee on Surgical Training (JCST) urological training curriculum to equip newly appointed urology trainees to work as competent junior registrars. Delivered annually in Leeds since 2015, the course has had excellent feedback and results in improving the urological knowledge of trainees, as well as increases in trainees’ confidence. This paper will provide a summary of how the course was designed, delivered, reproduced, sustained and evaluated. Its success is demonstrated by its incorporation into the UK urology training programme, and since 2018, it is now recommended to all new urology residents in the UK. The course implementation model would be applicable to other surgical specialties.","Please, Helen; Biyani, Chandra Shekhar",Indian J Surg,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12262-021-03016-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34248308/,354
635627,Preparation of Recombinant Viral Glycoproteins for Novel and Therapeutic Antibody Discovery,2008-12-10,"Despite widespread recognition of the right to a nationality, statelessness and its attendant vulnerabilities continue to characterize the lives of millions in South Asia. During the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, when states turned inward to protect their own citizens, refugees and de facto stateless persons found themselves excluded from humanitarian services and health care and were denied the ability to claim rights. Stateless women faced the additional burden of gender-based violence, a hostile labor market, and the threat of trafficking. This paper analyzes gender and statelessness as vectors of exclusion in South Asia, where asylum seekers are neither recognized by law nor protected by social institutions. We argue that citizenship constitutes an unearned form of social capital that is claimed and experienced in distinctively gendered ways. The pandemic has shone a bright light on the perils of statelessness, particularly for women, who face exacerbated economic inequities, the forced commodification of their sexuality, and exclusion from mechanisms of justice.","Chakraborty, Roshni; Bhabha, Jacqueline",Health Hum Rights,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34194216/,354

METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis with subgroup meta-analysis (PRISMA guidelines) between severe and non-severe COVID-19. RESULTS: We included nine trials. Overall, the mortality rate was 24.5% (821/3357) in the tocilizumab group and 29.1% (908/3125) in the control group at day 28–30 (pooled OR, 0.85; 95% CI 0.76–0.96; p = 0.006). Considering the subgroup analysis, this benefit on mortality was confirmed and amplified in the severe COVID-19 group (pooled OR, 0.82; 95% CI 0.73–0.93; p = 0.001) but not in the non-severe COVID-19 group (pooled OR, 1.46; 95% CI 0.91–2.34; p = 0.12). For patients who were not mechanically ventilated at baseline (5523/6482), the pooled OR (0.74; 95% CI 0.64–0.85; p < 0.0001) for mechanical ventilation incidence at day 28–30 was in favor of tocilizumab (cumulative incidence of 14.8% versus 19.4% in tocilizumab and control arm, respectively). This benefit was confirmed in both subgroups, i.e., severe and non-severe COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Tocilizumab is an effective treatment in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and hypoxemia by improving survival and decreasing mechanical ventilation requirement.

CASE PRESENTATION: An elderly individual presented for evaluation of dyspnea, fatigue, dizziness, weight loss, and a low-grade fever. The patient denied intravenous drug abuse, blood-borne viral infection, cardiac trauma, congenital heart disease, and immunocompromise. Echocardiography identified a large vegetation on the right pulmonary valve leaflet consistent with isolated PVE. Blood cultures grew E. faecalis. Computed tomography failed to reveal an infectious source. The patient completed a six-week course of antibiotics and was followed with serial echocardiography for three years, but subsequently developed severe pulmonic insufficiency and right heart failure necessitating pulmonary valve replacement. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Isolated PVE is responsible for less than 2.0% of all cases of infective endocarditis. The vast majority of reported cases are associated with risk factors and are caused by gram-positive organisms including Staphylococcus species and Streptococcus viridans. Echocardiography identifies most cases of isolated PVE. Septic embolization of vegetation fragments to lung parenchyma is common. Surgery is reserved for patients who are unresponsive to antibiotics or those who develop severe pulmonary insufficiency with symptoms of right heart failure, as seen here. CONCLUSION: We present an unusual case of isolated E. faecalis PVE without known risk factors that required pulmonary valve replacement three years after antimicrobial therapy.","Biesboer, Elise A.; Ayala, Gelique D.; Cummings, Austin C.; Sutter, Heather A.; Iqbal, Zafar; Pagel, Paul S.; Almassi, G.

KD appears to be a hyper-inflammatory response elicited by environmental or infectious agents (including respiratory viruses) in genetically predisposed individuals. Numerous reports from the current era of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic have described the occurrence of KD/KD-like illness in close temporal proximity to SARS-CoV-2 infection or exposure. Notably, KD has been reported in association with H(1)N(1)-pdm09 virus that caused the previous pandemic a decade ago. Non-H(1)N(1) influenza infections as well as influenza vaccination have also been reported to trigger KD. Herein, we report a case of H(1)N(1)-pdm09 influenza who developed KD. We review the published literature on influenza infection or vaccination triggering KD. This may help in a better understanding of the KD/KD-like illness associated with SARS-CoV-2. Besides, we also evaluate the safety of aspirin in influenza-triggered KD as aspirin administration in children with influenza is associated with the risk of development of Reye syndrome.

It is not known whether COVID-19 affects patients differently across the two continents. We aimed to describe our cohort of patients admitted to a single British centre with COVID-19 in comparison to a Chinese cohort of similar size and admitted over a similar time period to Chinese centres. We present a comparison of 62 Chinese and 71 British cases hospitalised for COVID-19. Cases in both sites were confirmed by a positive RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal swabs. Comparison analysis highlighted some differences between both populations. The most striking difference is the significantly older age of the British population (72% of the British ≥ 66 years compared to only 3% of the Chinese patients, difference of 69%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 68.3% to 69.7%, respectively) and the associated significant premorbid conditions (85% of patients vs 32%, difference of 53%, 95% CI 52 to 54%, respectively). Gastrointestinal and general symptoms were more common clinical presentation in the British while respiratory symptoms were more prominent in the Chinese cohort. Mortality was significantly higher in the British cohort 14% compared to none in the Chinese cohort (difference of 14%, 95% CI 13.7 to 14.3%). We conclude that COVID-19 does present differently in these two cohorts, but the apparent differences in the clinical presentations could be explained by the inherent differences in the demographics and case mix between both countries.","Conway, J.; Gould, A.; Westley, R.; Khan, S.; Emmerton, D.; Raju, S.

649462,Clinical and biological insights from viral genome sequencing,2017-01-16,"BACKGROUND: CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD), a severe neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by early onset epilepsy, intellectual disability, and autistic features, is caused by mutations in the CDKL5 gene. Evidence in animal models of CDD showed that absence of CDKL5 negatively affects neuronal survival, as well as neuronal maturation and dendritic outgrowth; however, knowledge of the substrates underlying these alterations is still limited. Neuroinflammatory processes are known to contribute to neuronal dysfunction and death. Recent evidence shows a subclinical chronic inflammatory status in plasma from CDD patients. However, to date, it is unknown whether a similar inflammatory status is present in the brain of CDD patients and, if so, whether this plays a causative or exacerbating role in the pathophysiology of CDD. METHODS: We evaluated microglia activation using AIF-1 immunofluorescence, proinflammatory cytokine expression, and signaling in the brain of a mouse model of CDD, the Cdkl5 KO mouse, which is characterized by an impaired survival of hippocampal neurons that worsens with age. Hippocampal neuron survival was determined by DCX, NeuN, and cleaved caspase-3 immunostaining in Cdkl5 KO mice treated with luteolin (10 mg/kg), a natural anti-inflammatory flavonoid. Since hippocampal neurons of Cdkl5 KO mice exhibit increased susceptibility to excitotoxic stress, we evaluated neuronal survival in Cdkl5 KO mice injected with NMDA (60 mg/kg) after a 7-day treatment with luteolin. RESULTS: We found increased microglial activation in the brain of the Cdkl5 KO mouse. We found alterations in microglial cell morphology and number, increased levels of AIF-1 and proinflammatory cytokines, and activation of STAT3 signaling. Remarkably, treatment with luteolin recovers microglia alterations as well as neuronal survival and maturation in Cdkl5 KO mice, and prevents the increase in NMDA-induced cell death in the hippocampus. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that neuroinflammatory processes contribute to the pathogenesis of CDD and imply the potential usefulness of luteolin as a treatment option in CDD patients.

At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, a federal government advisory group recommended a rapid, tailored Indigenous response to prevent predicted high morbidity and mortality rates. This paper examines the efforts of one ACCHO, which in the absence of dedicated funding, pivoted its operations in response to COVID-19. Gurriny Yealamucka Health Service (Gurriny) is the only primary healthcare service in the discrete Indigenous community of Yarrabah, Far North Queensland. METHODS: The research was conducted at the request of the Chief Executive Officer of Gurriny. Using grounded theory methods, thirteen Gurriny staff and five Yarrabah and government leaders and community members were interviewed, transcripts of these interviews and 59 documents were imported into NVIVO-12 and coded, and key concepts were compared, organised into higher order constructs, then structured into a theoretical framework. RESULTS: Gurriny responded to COVID-19 by leading with local solutions to keep Yarrabah safe. Four key strategies were implemented: managing the health service operations, realigning services, educating and supporting community, and working across agencies. These strategies were enabled or hindered by five conditions: the governance and leadership capacity of Gurriny, relying on the health taskforce, locking the door, “copping it”, and (not) having resources. A year after the first case was experienced in Australia and on the eve of vaccine rollout to Indigenous communities, there have been no COVID-19 cases in Yarrabah. DISCUSSION: The success of the locally led, holistic, comprehensive and culturally safe response of Gurriny suggests that such tailored place-based approaches to pandemics (and other health issues) are appropriate, but require dedicated resourcing. Key challenges were the fragmented and rapidly changing government processes, poorly coordinated communication and resource allocation channels, and bottlenecks in hierarchical funding approval processes. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 response in Yarrabah demonstrates the need for governance reform towards greater resourcing and support for local decision making by Aboriginal community-controlled health organisations.","McCalman, Janya; Longbottom, Marlene; Fagan, Sara; Fagan, Ruth; Andrews, Suzanne; Miller, Adrian",BMC Health Serv Res,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-021-06761-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34301256/,354

In this systematic literature review, we analyzed different perspectives concerning this situation, aiming to provide recommendations that could guide surgeons and entities toward screening, elective and emergency surgeries, decision making, and operating room management. A computerized search in PubMed, Scopus, and Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO) for relevant literature up to April 4, 2020, was performed. Articles were included if they were related to surgery dynamics in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Of the 281 articles found in our initial search and 15 articles from alternative sources, 39 were included in our review after a systematic evaluation. Concerning preoperative testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, 29 (74.4%) articles recommended some kind of screening. Another major suggestion was postponing all (or at least selected) elective operations (29 articles, 74.4%). Several additional recommendations with respect to surgical practice or surgical staff were also assessed and discussed, such as performing laparoscopic surgeries and avoiding the use of electrocauterization. On the basis of the current literature, we concluded that any surgery that can be delayed should be postponed. COVID-19 screening is strongly recommended for all surgical cases. Moreover, surgical staff should be reduced to the essential members and provided with institutional psychological support.","Hojaij, Flávio Carneiro; Chinelatto, Lucas Albuquerque; Boog, Gustavo Henrique Pereira; Kasmirski, Júlia Adriana; Lopes, João Vitor Ziroldo; Sacramento, Fernando Mauad",Clinics (Sao Paulo),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32428115/; https://doi.org/10.6061/clinics/2020/e1923,354

However, the optimal timing of surgery in patients with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection remains unknown. This case report describes a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia complicated by multi-organ system failure requiring intubation who sustained a femoral neck fracture that required total hip arthroplasty (THA). This patient had a significant, deliberate delay in time to surgical intervention due to his critical state. When deciding the optimal timing for THA in COVID-19 patients we recommend utilizing inflammatory markers, such as procalcitonin and IL-6, as indicators of disease resolution and caution operative intervention when patients are nearing the 7-10(th) day of COVID-19 symptoms. Furthermore, implant cementation and spinal anesthesia in critically ill COVID-positive patients should be approached cautiously in the setting of pulmonary disease and multi-organ system failure. Close follow-up with medical doctors is recommended to minimize long-term sequelae and delay to baseline mobility.","Kaidi, Austin C.; Held, Michael B.; Boddapati, Venkat; Trofa, David P.; Neuwirth, Alexander L.",Arthroplast Today,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32802926/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352344120301254; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352344120301254?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artd.2020.07.006,354

Farm animal populations as models for infectious diseases of humans,2009-12-30,"To survey for canine bocavirus (CBoV) infection, 83 Korean dogs showing several clinical signs were collected in different provinces from January 2013 to July 2014. Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and in situ hybridization, CBoVs were detected in intestine and/or lung samples of 8 dogs (9.6%). To reveal the genetic characteristics of CBoVs, partial or complete regions of CBoVs were sequenced. In phylogenetic trees, 8 CBoVs fell into three clusters. The CBoV strains 13D226-1, 13D250, and 14Q216 were closely related to the CBoV HK831F strain, and the CBoV 14D142 strain was related to the CBoV HK882F strain. Lastly, CBoV 13D003, 13D095, 14D193, and 14Q209 strains were related to CBoV Dis-023, Dis-040, and Dis-046 strains. Interestingly, no canine pathogens were found in dogs in which four CBoVs (13D003, 13D0095, 14D142, and 14D193 strains) were detected and three of them (13D003, 13D095, and 14D193 strains) had a unique deletion (18 nucleotides) in the VP2 gene. Further, the open reading frame 4 (ORF4) region was absent in these 4CBoVs, but found in the other strains, which indicates that the absence of the ORF4 region rather than a unique deletion may have an influence on the pathogenesis of CBoV in dogs.","Choi, Jeong-Won; Lee, Kyung-Hyun; Lee, Jae-Il; Lee, Myoung-Heon; Lee, Kyoung-Ki; Oem, Jae-Ku",Vet Microbiol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113515002850; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2015.07.023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26233679/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113515002850,354

668015,Modeling the dynamic kinetics of microbial disinfection with dissipating chemical agents—a theoretical investigation,2021-01-04,"The COVID-19 pandemic is having major economic and personal consequences for collegiate and professional sports. Sporting events have been canceled or postponed, and even when baseball and basketball seasons resumed in the United States recently, no fans were in attendance. As play resumed, several players developed COVID-19, disrupting some of the schedules. A hypothesis now under scientific consideration is that taking vitamin supplements to raise serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations could quickly reduce the risk and/or severity of COVID-19. Several mechanisms have been identified through which vitamin D could reduce the risks of infection and severity, death, and long-haul effects of COVID-19: (1) inducing production of cathelicidin and defensins to reduce the survival and replication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus; (2) reducing inflammation and the production of proinflammatory cytokines and risk of the “cytokine storm” that damages the epithelial layer of the lungs, heart, vascular system, and other organs; and (3) increasing production of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, thus limiting the amount of angiotensin II available to the virus to cause damage. Clinical trials have confirmed that vitamin D supplementation reduces risk of acute respiratory tract infections, and approximately 30 observational studies have shown that incidence, severity, and death from COVID-19 are inversely correlated with serum 25(OH)D concentrations. Vitamin D supplementation is already familiar to many athletes and sports teams because it improves athletic performance and increases playing longevity. Thus, athletes should consider vitamin D supplementation to serve as an additional means by which to reduce risk of COVID-19 and its consequences.","Grant, William B.; Lahore, Henry; Rockwell, Michelle S.",Nutrients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33291720/; https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12123741,354

Due to the imminent risk of infection, monitoring intervals of rheumatic patients have prolonged. The aim of this study is to present insights from patients, rheumatologists, and digital product developers on the ongoing digital health transition in rheumatology. A qualitative and participatory semi-structured fishbowl approach was conducted to gain detailed insights from a total of 476 participants. The main findings show that digital health and remote care are generally welcomed by the participants. Five key themes emerged from the qualitative content analysis: (1) digital rheumatology use cases, (2) user descriptions, (3) adaptation to different environments of rheumatology care, and (4) potentials of and (5) barriers to digital rheumatology implementation. Codes were scaled by positive and negative ratings as well as on micro, meso, and macro levels. A main recommendation resulting from the insights is that both patients and rheumatologists need more information and education to successfully implement digital health tools into clinical routine.","Mühlensiepen, Felix; Kurkowski, Sandra; Krusche, Martin; Mucke, Johanna; Prill, Robert; Heinze, Martin; Welcker, Martin; Schulze-Koops, Hendrik; Vuillerme, Nicolas; Schett, Georg; Knitza, Johannes",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33807952/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18052636,354
674569,Ibis T5000: a universal biosensor approach for microbiology,2008-06-03,"The Fairwork Project is an international action-research project that currently operates in over 20 countries. The project focuses on working conditions in the platform economy, in order to develop ‘fairness ratings’ for digital labour platforms. With respect to Germany, the project evaluated the working conditions offered by ten digital labour platforms, by scoring them against the Fairwork principles and producing a national league table. We found that even in a highly regulated labour market context like the German one, platform workers experience precarity and insecurity and have limited access to employment rights. A number of platform workers are classified as employees rather than self-employed, and this guarantees a number of employment rights, including entitlement to minimum wage, health and safety protection and social protection. However, the existence of an employment relationship does not necessarily ensure platform work to be fair as other factors, including the existence of complex networks of subcontracting, erode labour standards and deprive workers of basic employment rights. Practical Relevance: While there are tens of millions of digital platform workers around the world performing functions essential to society—as demonstrated drastically by the Covid-19 pandemic—by supplying food, care and passenger transportation services, many platform workers face low pay, precarity as well as poor and dangerous working conditions. Exposing fracture lines of inequalities affecting particularly women, migrants and minority-ethnic groups who form the core part of the gig workforce, the international Fairwork research project aims not just to understand the gig economy, but to change it.","Bertolini, Alessio; Borkert, Maren; Ferrari, Fabian; Graham, Mark",Z Arbeitswiss,https://doi.org/10.1007/s41449-021-00247-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34121798/,354

677680,Biting back against rabies,2010-09-16,"COVID-19 is a novel virus that causes infection in both the upper respiratory tract and the lungs. The numbers of cases and deaths have increased on a daily basis on the scale of a global pandemic. Chest X-ray images have proven useful for monitoring various lung diseases and have recently been used to monitor the COVID-19 disease. In this paper, deep-learning-based approaches, namely deep feature extraction, fine-tuning of pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNN), and end-to-end training of a developed CNN model, have been used in order to classify COVID-19 and normal (healthy) chest X-ray images. For deep feature extraction, pretrained deep CNN models (ResNet18, ResNet50, ResNet101, VGG16, and VGG19) were used. For classification of the deep features, the Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier was used with various kernel functions, namely Linear, Quadratic, Cubic, and Gaussian. The aforementioned pretrained deep CNN models were also used for the fine-tuning procedure. A new CNN model is proposed in this study with end-to-end training. A dataset containing 180 COVID-19 and 200 normal (healthy) chest X-ray images was used in the study’s experimentation. Classification accuracy was used as the performance measurement of the study. The experimental works reveal that deep learning shows potential in the detection of COVID-19 based on chest X-ray images. The deep features extracted from the ResNet50 model and SVM classifier with the Linear kernel function produced a 94.7% accuracy score, which was the highest among all the obtained results. The achievement of the fine-tuned ResNet50 model was found to be 92.6%, whilst end-to-end training of the developed CNN model produced a 91.6% result. Various local texture descriptors and SVM classifications were also used for performance comparison with alternative deep approaches; the results of which showed the deep approaches to be quite efficient when compared to the local texture descriptors in the detection of COVID-19 based on chest X-ray images.","Ismael, Aras M.; Şengür, Abdulkadir",Expert Syst Appl,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417420308198?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2020.114054; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0957417420308198; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33013005/,354

While the government should prioritize the curbing of epidemics, minimal attention has been paid to residents' positive outlook of tourism recovery, which affects public engagement during the recovery stage. Through an online survey conducted with 228 Macao residents in the early phase of epidemic, this study found that residents anticipate quick tourism recovery when they are satisfied with the government's performance in dealing with epidemic, because of their self-efficacy in avoiding infection and government efficacy in tourism recovery, but not relief of emotional concern.

688348,Feline infectious peritonitis virus-associated rhinitis in a cat,2020-06-23,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection has claimed hundreds of lives and has become a global threat since its emergence in Saudi Arabia in 2012. The ability of MERS-CoV to evade the host innate antiviral response may contribute to its severe pathogenesis. Many MERS-CoV-encoded proteins were identified to have interferon (IFN)-antagonizing properties, which correlates well with the reduced IFN levels observed in infected patients and ex vivo models. In this study, we fully characterized the IFN-antagonizing property of the MERS-CoV M protein. Expression of MERS-CoV M protein suppressed type I IFN expression in response to Sendai virus infection or poly(I:C) induction. This suppressive effect was found to be specific for the activation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) but not nuclear factor-κB. MERS-CoV M protein interacted with TRAF3 and disrupted TRAF3–TBK1 association leading to reduced IRF3 activation. M proteins from MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV have three highly similar conserved N-terminal transmembrane domains and a C-terminal region. Using chimeric and truncation mutants, the N-terminal transmembrane domains of the MERS-CoV M protein were found to be sufficient for its inhibitory effect on IFN expression, whereas the C-terminal domain was unable to induce this suppression. Collectively, our findings suggest a common and conserved mechanism through which highly pathogenic MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV harness their M proteins to suppress type I IFN expression at the level of TBK1-dependent phosphorylation and activation of IRF3 resulting in evasion of the host innate antiviral response.","Lui, Pak-Yin; Wong, Lok-Yin Roy; Fung, Cheuk-Lai; Siu, Kam-Leung; Yeung, Man-Lung; Yuen, Kit-San; Chan, Chi-Ping; Woo, Patrick Chiu-Yat; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; Jin, Dong-Yan",Emerg Microbes Infect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27094905/; https://doi.org/10.1038/emi.2016.33,354
688634,Viral security proteins: counteracting host defences,2010-11-09,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is now a worldwide public health crisis. The causative pathogen is severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Novel therapeutic agents are desperately needed. Because of the frequent mutations in the virus and its ability to cause cytokine storms, targeting the viral proteins has some drawbacks. Targeting cellular factors or pivotal inflammatory pathways triggered by SARS-CoV-2 may produce a broader range of therapies. Glycyrrhizic acid (GA) might be beneficial against SARS-CoV-2 because of its anti-inflammatory and antiviral characteristics and possible ability to regulate crucial host factors. However, the mechanism underlying how GA regulates host factors remains to be determined. Methods: In our report, we conducted a bioinformatics analysis to identify possible GA targets, biological functions, protein-protein interactions, transcription-factor-gene interactions, transcription-factor-miRNA coregulatory networks, and the signaling pathways of GA against COVID-19. Results: Protein-protein interactions and network analysis showed that ICAM1, MMP9, TLR2, and SOCS3 had higher degree values, which may be key targets of GA for COVID-19. GO analysis indicated that the response to reactive oxygen species was significantly enriched. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that the IL-17, IL-6, TNF-α, IFN signals, complement system, and growth factor receptor signaling are the main pathways. The interactions of TF genes and miRNA with common targets and the activity of TFs were also recognized. Conclusions: GA may inhibit COVID-19 through its anti-oxidant, anti-viral, and anti-inflammatory effects, and its ability to activate the immune system, and targeted therapy for those pathways is a predominant strategy to inhibit the cytokine storms triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Zheng, Wenjiang; Huang, Xiufang; Lai, Yanni; Liu, Xiaohong; Jiang, Yong; Zhan, Shaofeng",Front Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2021.631206; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34177566/,354
