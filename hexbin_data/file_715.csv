11177,Accidental Burn in a Neonate in Neonatal Intensive Care Unit: What Could be the Cause?,2020-03-20,"Chikungunya is a mosquito-borne disease, caused by the member of the Togaviridae family belongs to the genus alphavirus, making it a major threat in all developing countries as well as some developed countries. The mosquito acts as a vector for the disease and carries the CHIK-Virus. To date there is no direct treatment available and that demands the development of more effective vaccines. In this study author employed Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource, a machine learning-based algorithm principally working on the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm, also known as (IEDB-ANN) for the prediction and analysis of Epitopes. A total of 173 epitopes were identified on the basis of IC50 values, among them 40 epitopes were found, sharing part with the linear B-cell epitopes and exposed to the cTAP1protein, and out of 40, 6 epitopes were noticed to show interactions with the cTAP with their binding energy ranging from − 3.61 to − 1.22 kcal/mol. The six epitopes identified were exposed to the HLA class I alleles and from this all revealed interaction with the HLA alleles and minimum binding energy that ranges from − 4.12 to − 5.88 kcal/mol. Besides, two T cell epitopes i.e. (145)KVFTGVYPE(153) and (395)STVPVAPPR(403) were found most promiscuous candidates. These promiscuous epitopes-HLA complexes were further analyzed by the molecular dynamics simulation to check the stability of the complex. Results obtained from this study suggest that the identified epitopes i.e. and (395)STVPVAPPR(403), are likely to be capable of passing through the lumen of ER to bind withthe HLA class I allele and provide new insights and potential application in the designing and development of peptide-based vaccine candidate for the treatment of chikungunya.","Saxena, Prashant; Mishra, Sanjay",Int J Pept Res Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223317/,715

470842,"European Association of Nuclear Medicine October 22 - 30, 2020 Virtual",2020,"The COVID-19 outbreak is the most serious test of the international system since the 2008 global financial crisis. Rather than cooperate to contain and respond to a common threat, the world's leading powers, the United States and China, increasingly blamed each other through wildly speculative theories about the origins of the virus. The World Health Organization (WHO) sought to coordinate a global response but it has been hamstrung and come under attack. Given past cooperation between major powers to mobilize and eradicate smallpox and previous U.S. leadership to fight HIV/AIDS and the 2014 West African Ebola crisis, the limited cooperation and lack of leadership are puzzling. What explains the anemic global response to date? This paper draws from structural international relations theory to suggest a partial but somewhat dissatisfying answer. International organizations are inherently weak faced with opposition by major powers. The international system simultaneously incentivizes states to cooperate and address common threats but at the same time encourages countries to take care of themselves, potentially at the expense of others. Which of these motives dominates cannot be explained by structural theory, requiring us to look to other factors such as the attributes of states or of leaders themselves.","Busby, Joshua W",J. health polit. policy law,,715

This paper presents the third annual iterative outcomes of an innovative university-based space program using Project Based Learning (PBL) methodology in creating design ideas for astronaut health support and wellbeing during a long duration mission (LDM) for a future inhabited lunar moon base or Mars Mission astronaut transit. University faculties including Built Environment, Industrial Design, Engineering, Science, and Health, at Western Sydney University Australia and supported by University of Houston USA are brought together to develop a new understanding of discipline capabilities with the prospect to co-creatively provide new opportunities and inspiration for teamwork across fields. This is of key interest to employers of new graduates in space or innovation-based industries where human factors and designing for high quality human-centered outcomes supports career resilience through currency, agility, and focus. The altruistic nature of interactions that make the ISS a success on multiple levels across cultural, scientific and humanitarian foundations provide the template for cross-disciplinary inspiration, that leverage synergies, and shared goals unattainable by single fields alone. It is not common for disciplines to work so closely together though industry has an expectation for this knowledge. Previously teams of three (2018);five (2019), and now ten undergraduates in 2020 represent team formation. Student numbers across the design for space theme have grown annually from fifteen, to twenty-five, to forty students in 2020. Now opportunities to respond to the complexities of the project in more detail are presented in addressing the overarching research domains in spatial design, human factors and design for health for LDMs. Team supervisory academic staff grew from 1-to-3 and provided further team guidance and discipline specialisations to inform three iterative project phases across the twelve activity weeks for four teams focusing on human spaceflight, exercise, related design performance and materials, and selected UNSDGs principles. The paper outlines the methodological approach, assessment methods, acculturation to working in teams and immersion in space knowledge for newcomers, and a review of forty collaborative outcomes all conducted by migrating Online during the COVID19 pandemic of 2020 by necessity.

470853,"European Association of Nuclear Medicine October 22 - 30, 2020 Virtual",2020,"Matrix proteins are encoded by many enveloped viruses, including influenza viruses, herpes viruses, and coronaviruses. Underneath the viral envelope of influenza virus, matrix protein 1 (M1) forms an oligomeric layer critical for particle stability and pH-dependent RNA genome release. However, high-resolution structures of full-length monomeric M1 and the matrix layer have not been available, impeding antiviral targeting and understanding of the pH-dependent transitions involved in cell entry. Here, purification and extensive mutagenesis revealed protein-protein interfaces required for the formation of multilayered helical M1 oligomers similar to those observed in virions exposed to the low pH of cell entry. However, single-layered helical oligomers with biochemical and ultrastructural similarity to those found in infectious virions before cell entry were observed upon mutation of a single amino acid. The highly ordered structure of the single-layered oligomers and their likeness to the matrix layer of intact virions prompted structural analysis by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The resulting 3.4-Å-resolution structure revealed the molecular details of M1 folding and its organization within the single-shelled matrix. The solution of the full-length M1 structure, the identification of critical assembly interfaces, and the development of M1 assembly assays with purified proteins are crucial advances for antiviral targeting of influenza viruses.","Selzer, Lisa; Su, Zhaoming; Pintilie, Grigore D; Chiu, Wah; Kirkegaard, Karla",PLoS Biol,,715

In this study, we analyze the impact of various stochastic disturbances on the epidemic dynamics during the quarantine period. For this purpose, we present an SIQS epidemic model that incorporates the stochastic transmission and the L\'evy noise in order to simulate both small and massive perturbations. Under appropriate conditions, some interesting asymptotic properties are proved, namely: ergodicity, persistence in the mean, and extinction of the disease. The theoretical results show that the dynamics of the perturbed model are determined by parameters that are closely related to the stochastic noises.

The COVID-19 pandemic brought into light ACE2, its principal product angiotensin (Ang) 1-7, and the G protein-coupled receptor for the heptapeptide (MasR), which together form a still under-recognized arm of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). This axis counteracts vasoconstriction, inflammation and fibrosis, generated by the more familiar deleterious arm of RAS, including ACE, Ang II and the ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R). The COVID-19 disease is characterized by the depletion of ACE2 and Ang-(1-7), conceivably playing a central role in the devastating cytokine storm that characterizes this disorder. ACE2 repletion and the administration of Ang-(1-7) constitute the therapeutic options currently tested in the management of severe COVID-19 disease cases. Based on their beneficial effects, both ACE2 and Ang-(1-7) have also been suggested to slow the progression of experimental diabetic and hypertensive chronic kidney disease (CKD). Herein, we report a further step undertaken recently, utilizing this type of intervention in the management of evolving acute kidney injury (AKI), with the expectation of renal vasodilation and the attenuation of oxidative stress, inflammation, renal parenchymal damage and subsequent fibrosis. Most outcomes indicate that triggering the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/MasR axis may be renoprotective in the setup of AKI. Yet, there is contradicting evidence that under certain conditions it may accelerate renal damage in CKD and AKI. The nature of these conflicting outcomes requires further elucidation.","Heyman, Samuel N; Walther, Thomas; Abassi, Zaid",,,715

This axis counteracts vasoconstriction, inflammation and fibrosis, generated by the more familiar deleterious arm of RAS, including ACE, Ang II and the ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R). The COVID-19 disease is characterized by the depletion of ACE2 and Ang-(1-7), conceivably playing a central role in the devastating cytokine storm that characterizes this disorder. ACE2 repletion and the administration of Ang-(1-7) constitute the therapeutic options currently tested in the management of severe COVID-19 disease cases. Based on their beneficial effects, both ACE2 and Ang-(1-7) have also been suggested to slow the progression of experimental diabetic and hypertensive chronic kidney disease (CKD). Herein, we report a further step undertaken recently, utilizing this type of intervention in the management of evolving acute kidney injury (AKI), with the expectation of renal vasodilation and the attenuation of oxidative stress, inflammation, renal parenchymal damage and subsequent fibrosis. Most outcomes indicate that triggering the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/MasR axis may be renoprotective in the setup of AKI. Yet, there is contradicting evidence that under certain conditions it may accelerate renal damage in CKD and AKI. The nature of these conflicting outcomes requires further elucidation.","Heyman, Samuel N; Walther, Thomas; Abassi, Zaid",,,715

All measures were significantly lower in PWD who live in an institution, such as a nursing home or long-term care facility or who attend adult daycare than PWD who live in a community dwelling . The values from these two groups were significantly lower than those from healthy older people. Moderate to high negative correlations between upper extremity functional activity and respiratory function (-.73 < rs < -.49) and cognitive function (rs = -.83), and between cognitive function and respiratory function (-.74 < rs < -.58) were identified (p < .001). When adjusted for cognitive function (-.38 < rs < -.29; p < .05), the association between upper limb functional activity and respiratory function decreased. The decline demonstrates the importance of physical activity and cognitive and respiratory function in PWD.","Paixão, Cátia; Tavares, Ana; Marques, Alda",J Aging Phys Act,,715

Here, we reviewed the messages spontaneously sent by patients to an Italian PD clinic during the first two weeks of COVID-19 lockdown (9-21 March 2020), in order to highlight their main needs and then outline appropriate strategies of care for this critical period. One hundred sixty-two messages were analysed. Forty-six percent queried about clinical services; 28% communicated an acute clinical worsening for which a therapeutic change was done in 52% of cases; 17% (those patients with younger age and milder disease) asked about the relationship between PD and COVID-19; 8% informed about an intercurrent event. Our analysis suggests that PD patients' needs during COVID-19 emergency include appropriate and complete information, a timely update on changes in clinical services, and the continuity of care, even in a remote mode. By addressing these issues, acute clinical worsening, complications and subsequent therapeutic changes could be prevented.

Drawing on the cognitive-affective personality system theory (CAPS), we tested the dynamic influence of daily perceived uncertainty on COVID-19 on daily impulsive buying via daily information overload and daily information anxiety in a two-wave experience sampling method (ESM) design. Through a multilevel structural equation model (MSEM) analysis, we found that the daily perceived uncertainty on COVID-19 affected daily information overload, which in turn stimulated daily information anxiety, ultimately determining the daily impulsive buying. Namely, daily information overload and daily information anxiety played a complete chain-mediating role between the daily perceived uncertainty on COVID-19 and daily impulsive buying. The present paper is the first to uncover the important dynamic effect of the perceived uncertainty on COVID-19 on impulsive buying with diary data.

METHODS: A total of 33 urological units with physicians affiliated to the AGILE consortium (Italian Group for Advanced Laparo-Endoscopic Surgery; www.agilegroup.it) were surveyed. Urologists were asked to report the amount of surgical elective procedures week-by-week, from the beginning of the emergency to the following month. RESULTS: The 33 hospitals involved in the study account overall for 22 945 beds and are distributed in 13/20 Italian regions. Before the outbreak, the involved urology units performed overall 1213 procedures/week, half of which were oncological. A month later, the number of surgeries had declined by 78%. Lombardy, the first region with positive COVID-19 cases, experienced a 94% reduction. The decrease in oncological and non-oncological surgical activity was 35.9% and 89%, respectively. The trend of the decline showed a delay of roughly 2 weeks for the other regions. CONCLUSION: Italy, a country with a high fatality rate from COVID-19, experienced a sudden decline in surgical activity. This decline was inversely related to the increase in COVID-19 care, with potential harm particularly in the oncological field. The Italian experience may be helpful for future surgical pre-planning in other countries not so drastically affected by the disease to date.","Rocco, Bernardo; Sighinolfi, Maria Chiara; Sandri, Marco; Altieri, Vincenzo; Amenta, Michele; Annino, Filippo; Antonelli, Alessandro; Baio, Raffaele; Bertolo, Riccardo; Bocciardi, AldoMassimo; Borghesi, Marco; Bove, Pierluigi; Bozzini, Giorgio; Brunocilla, Eugenio; Cacciamani, Giovanni; Calori, Alberto; Cafarelli, Angelo; Celia, Antonio; Carbone, Antonio; Cocci, Andrea; Corsaro, Alfio; Costa, Giovanni; Ceruti, Carlo; Cindolo, Luca; Crivellaro, Simone; Dalpiaz, Orietta; D039,; Agostino, Daniele; Dall039,; Oglio, Bruno; Dente, Donato; Falabella, Roberto; Falsaperla, Mario; Ferrari, Giovanni; Finocchiaro, Marinella; Flammia, Simone; Gaboardi, Franco; Galfano, Antonio; Gallo, Fabrizio; Gatti, Lorenzo; Greco, Francesco; Khorrami, Sada; Leonardo, Costantino; Marenghi, Carlo; Nucciotti, Roberto; Oderda, Marco; Pagliarulo, Vincenzo; Parma, Paolo; Pastore, Antonio L; Pini, Giovannalberto; Porreca, Angelo; Pucci, Luigi",BJU int,,715

470898,"European Association of Nuclear Medicine October 22 - 30, 2020 Virtual",2020,"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has substantially impacted the healthcare delivery system in Tehran, Iran. The country's first confirmed positive test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was on February 18, 2020. Since then, the number of cases has steadily increased in Iran and worldwide. Emergency medical services (EMS) quickly adapted its operations to accommodate a greater number of patients, and it worked to decrease the risk of COVID-19 spread among EMS personnel, given the disease's high transmissibility. METHODS: We evaluated the chief complaint as well as the pattern and number of EMS calls and dispatches during the 28-day intervals before and after the February 18, 2020, COVID-19 outbreak in Iran. RESULTS: EMS calls increased from 355,241 in the pre-outbreak period to 1,589,346 in the post-outbreak period, a 347% increase (p<0.001). EMS dispatches rose more modestly from 82,282 to 99,926, a 21% increase (p<0.001). The average time on telephone hold decreased from 10.6 ± 12.7 seconds pre-outbreak to 9.8 ± 11.8 seconds post-outbreak, a 7% decrease (p<0.001). The average length of call also decreased from 1.32 ± 1.42 minutes pre-outbreak to 1.06 ± 1.28 minutes post-outbreak, a 20% decrease (p<0.001). The highest number of daily dispatches occurred during the second and third weeks of the four-week post-outbreak period, peaking at 4557 dispatches/day. After the first reported case of SARS-CoV-2, there were significant increases in chief complaints of fever (211% increase, p<0.001) and respiratory symptoms (245% increase, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The number of EMS calls and dispatches in Tehran increased 347% and 20%, respectively, after the outbreak of COVID-19. Despite this, the time on hold for EMS response decreased. The Tehran EMS system accomplished this by increasing personnel hours, expanding call-center resources, and implementing COVID-19-specific training.","Saberian, Peyman; Conovaloff, Joseph L; Vahidi, Elnaz; Hasani-Sharamin, Parisa; Kolivand, Pir-Hossein",West J Emerg Med,,715

In this brief meta-analysis, the reduction of lymphocyte subset counts in COVID-19 patients was investigated across 20 peer-reviewed studies meeting criteria for reporting lymphocyte subset counts and COVID-19 disease severity. CD4+ T cell, CD8+ T cell, B cell, NK cell, and total lymphocyte cell counts all showed statistically significant reduction in patients with severe/critical COVID-19 disease compared to mild/moderate disease. T-cell subsets showed the largest standardized magnitude of change. In some studies, multivariate analysis has shown that CD4 and/or CD8 T-cells counts are independently predictive of patient outcomes. © 2020 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry.","Huang, Wei; Berube, Julie; McNamara, Michelle; Saksena, Suraj; Hartman, Marsha; Arshad, Tariq; Bornheimer, Scott J; O039,; Gorman, Maurice",Cytometry A,,715
470902,"European Association of Nuclear Medicine October 22 - 30, 2020 Virtual",2020,"In this paper, we report a high power single frequency 1030â nm fiber laser with near-diffraction-limited beam quality based on a polarization-maintaining tapered Yb-doped fiber (T-YDF). The T-YDF has advantages of effectively suppressing stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) while maintaining good beam quality. As a result, a record output power of 379 W single frequency, linearly polarized, nearly single-mode fiber amplifier operating at 1030 nm is demonstrated. The polarization extinction ratio is as high as 16.3 dB, and the M2 is measured to be 1.12. Further, the dependence of the thermal-induced mode instability (TMI) threshold on the polarization state of an input signal laser is investigated for the first time. By changing the polarization state of the injected seed laser, the output power can increase to 550 W while the beam quality can be maintained well (M2=1.47). The slope efficiency of the whole amplifier is about 80%. No sign of SBS appears even at the highest output power and the further brightness scaling of both situations is limited by the TMI effect. To the best of our knowledge, this result is the highest output power of all-fiberized single frequency fiber amplifiers.","Lai, Wenchang; Ma, Pengfei; Liu, Wei; Huang, Long; Li, Can; Ma, Yanxing; Zhou, Pu",Opt Express,,715
470903,"European Association of Nuclear Medicine October 22 - 30, 2020 Virtual",2020,"OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to assess the volunteering of undergraduate health students and interns in the Ministry of Health (MOH) services in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) during the COVID-19 pandemic, its motivational factors and barriers, as well as their risk perception of COVID-19. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS: From 12 to 21 May 2020, an online survey was sent to all undergraduate health students and interns in the KSA. This included questions on demographics, volunteering status, risk perception of COVID-19, as well as motivations and barriers towards volunteering. RESULTS: In a convenience sample of 6016 students and interns across KSA, 1824 (30.31%) have volunteered with the MOH services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Volunteering was more likely among older participants, from the College of Medicine, those with self-perceived at risk of COVID-19 infection and those with self-perceived healthy participants. Females, those who did not think that students had moral duties to volunteer, those who were at risk of seasonal influenza and those with self-perceived at risk of hospitalisation from COVID-19 were less likely to volunteer. Patriotism, gaining experience, assisting when able and religious rewards all were reported as major motivators to volunteer. Non-volunteering participants reported that lack of interest, protocol and knowledge, as well as issues related to their personal health and transportation were the main barriers to volunteering. CONCLUSIONS: About one-third of undergraduate health students and interns volunteered during the first 2 months of the COVID-19 pandemic in KSA. Moral values were the most important motivations among volunteers. Efforts to encourage heath students and interns to volunteer and providing those with appropriate educational programmes are recommended.","AlOmar, Reem S; AlShamlan, Nouf A; AlAmer, Naheel A; Aldulijan, Fajar; AlMuhaidib, Seereen; Almukhadhib, Omar; Algarni, Saad A; Alshaibani, Askar; Darwish, Magdy; Al Shammari, Malak",BMJ Open,,715

METHOD: Descriptive study with a qualitative approach, convergent care type, developed in a Psychosocial Care Center for Alcohol and Drugs in the interior of the state of Goiás. RESULTS: The service in the waiting room provided moments of reflection, knowledge, learning, listening and exchanging experiences. Final considerations: The meetings in the waiting room favored the articulation between theoretical knowledge and the practice of nursing care in groups, constituting a space with a valuable locus for the development of educational and support actions in health services, to be undertaken by the nurse and, also, by other professionals of the health team.","Andrade, Juliana Macedo Melo; Farinha, Marciana Gonçalves; Esperidião, Elizabeth",Rev Bras Enferm,,715
