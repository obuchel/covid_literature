The overwhelming number of hospitalizations due to hRSV-induced ALRTI each year is due, at least in part, to the lack of licensed vaccines against this virus. Thus, hRSV infection is considered a major public health problem and economic burden in most countries. The lung pathology developed in hRSV-infected individuals is characterized by an exacerbated proinflammatory and unbalanced Th2-type immune response. In addition to the adverse effects in airway tissues, hRSV infection can also cause neurologic manifestations in the host, such as seizures and encephalopathy. Although the origins of these extrapulmonary symptoms remain unclear, studies with patients suffering from neurological alterations suggest an involvement of the inflammatory response against hRSV. Furthermore, hRSV has evolved numerous mechanisms to modulate and evade the immune response in the host. Several studies have focused on elucidating the interactions between hRSV virulence factors and the host immune system, to rationally design new vaccines and therapies against this virus. Here, we discuss about the infection, pathology, and immune response triggered by hRSV in the host.","Bohmwald, Karen; Espinoza, Janyra A.; Rey-Jurado, Emma; Gómez, Roberto S.; González, Pablo A.; Bueno, Susan M.; Riedel, Claudia A.; Kalergis, Alexis M.",Semin Respir Crit Care Med,486,12

Here, we utilized single-cell transcriptomic analyses to delineate NCC-derivatives along the posterior developing vertebrate, zebrafish, during the late embryonic to early larval stage, a period when NCCs are actively differentiating into distinct cellular lineages. We identified several major NCC/NCC-derived cell-types including mesenchyme, neural crest, neural, neuronal, glial, and pigment, from which we resolved over three dozen cellular subtypes. We dissected gene expression signatures of pigment progenitors delineating into chromatophore lineages, mesenchyme cells, and enteric NCCs transforming into enteric neurons. Global analysis of NCC derivatives revealed they were demarcated by combinatorial hox gene codes, with distinct profiles within neuronal cells. From these analyses, we present a comprehensive cell-type atlas that can be utilized as a valuable resource for further mechanistic and evolutionary investigations of NCC differentiation.","Howard, Aubrey GA; Baker, Phillip A; Ibarra-García-Padilla, Rodrigo; Moore, Joshua A; Rivas, Lucia J; Tallman, James J; Singleton, Eileen W; Westheimer, Jessa L; Corteguera, Julia A; Uribe, Rosa A",,486,12

Streptococcal M protein shares an extensive sequence homology with human epidermal keratins. Keratins 16 (K16) and 17 (K17) are mostly absent from uninvolved skin but are upregulated in psoriatic lesions. There is increasing evidence that CD8(+) T cells play an important effector role in psoriasis and M protein‐primed T cells may recognize these shared epitopes in skin via molecular mimicry. To identify candidate epitopes, peptides with sequences from K17 were selected on the basis of predicted binding to HLA‐Cw6 and sequence similarities with M6 protein. Matched peptides from the sequence of M6 protein and a set of peptides with poor predicted binding were also selected. Cw6(+) individuals with psoriasis and Cw6(+) healthy controls, having a family history of psoriasis, were recruited. PBMCs were incubated with the peptide antigens. T‐cell activation in the CD4(+), CD8(+) and later the skin‐homing cutaneous lymphocyte‐associated antigen (CLA)‐expressing subset of CD8(+) T cells was evaluated by CD69 expression and intracellular IFN‐γ accumulation using flow cytometry. We demonstrate that Cw6(+) psoriasis patients had significant CD8(+) T‐cell IFN‐γ responses to peptides from K17 and M6 protein selected on the basis of sequence homology and predicted HLA‐Cw*0602 binding. These responses were about 10 times more frequent in the skin‐homing cutaneous lymphocyte‐associated antigen‐expressing (CLA(+)) subset of CD8(+) T cells. CD4(+) T cells showed only borderline responses. CD8(+) T cells from Cw6 + nonpsoriatic individuals responded to some M6 peptides but very rarely to K17 peptides, and this also applied to the CLA(+)CD8(+) subset. These findings indicate that psoriatic individuals have CD8(+) T cells that recognize keratin self‐antigens and that epitopes shared by streptococcal M protein and human keratin may be targets for the CD8(+) T cells that infiltrate psoriatic skin lesions.","Johnston, A.; Gudjónsson, J.

METHODS We reviewed the medical records of 736 severe trauma patients with an Injury Severity Score of >15. Poisson regression was used to compare the infection rates according to the catheter insertion sites. Univariate analysis of the groups with and without CVC-related infection was used to identify confounding variables for inclusion in multivariate models that were used to identify the risk factors for CRLI and CRBSI. RESULTS We evaluated 1646 catheter insertions and their duration of insertion and found 1241 subclavian (18,461 days), 251 internal jugular (3454 days), and 154 femoral catheters (1526 days). The CRLI infection rate per 1000 catheter days was significantly lower for subclavian, compared to that for internal jugular (4.83 vs. 9.55, respectively; P < 0.001) and femoral catheters (4.83 vs. 7.93, respectively; P = 0.013). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that catheter insertion duration [odds ratio (95 % confidence interval): 1.035 (1.021-1.050), P < 0.001] and subclavian access [0.532 (0.366-0.775), P < 0.001] were significantly associated with CRLI, while catheter insertion duration [1.024 (1.002-1.046), P = 0.032] was significantly associated with CRBSI. CONCLUSIONS To reduce the rate of CVC-related infections in severe trauma patients, we suggest that catheters be shifted from the internal jugular or femoral veins to the subclavian vein as soon as possible and that the duration of catheter insertion should be minimized.","Youn, Seok Hwa; Lee, John Cook-Jong; Kim, Younghwan; Moon, Jonghwan; Choi, Younghwa; Jung, Kyoungwon",World journal of surgery,486,28

The vitamin profile of colostrum depends on the maternal vitamin status, which in turn is influenced by diet and lifestyle. Yet, the relationship between maternal vitamin status and colostrum vitamin composition has not been systematically reviewed. This review was conducted with the aim to generate a comprehensive overview on the relationship between maternal serum (plasma) vitamin concentration and corresponding colostrum composition. Three electronic databases, Embase (Ovid), Medline (Ovid), and Cochrane, were systematically searched based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Finally, a total of 11 eligible publications were included that examined the vitamins A, C, D, E, and K in both biological fluids. Maternal vitamin A, D, E, and K blood levels were unrelated to colostrum content of the respective vitamins, and serum vitamin A was inversely correlated with colostrum vitamin E. Colostrum versus maternal serum vitamins were higher for vitamins A, C, and K, lower for vitamin D, and divergent results were reported for vitamin E levels. Colostrum appears typically enriched in vitamin A, C, and K compared to maternal serum, possibly indicative of active mammary gland transport mechanisms. Inter-individual and inter-study high variability in colostrum's vitamin content endorses its sensitivity to external factors.","Y de Vries, Jasmijn; Pundir, Shikha; Mckenzie, Elizabeth; Keijer, Jaap; Kussmann, Martin",Nutrients,486,11

Changes in vital signs prior to clinical deterioration are well documented and early detection of preventable outcomes is key to timely intervention. Despite their role in clinical practice, how to best monitor and interpret them is still unclear. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the ability of vital sign trends to predict clinical deterioration in patients hospitalized with acute illness. DATA SOURCES PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and CINAHL were searched in December 2017. STUDY SELECTION Studies examining intermittently monitored vital sign trends in acutely ill adult patients on hospital wards and in emergency departments. Outcomes representing clinical deterioration were of interest. DATA EXTRACTION Performed separately by two authors using a preformed extraction sheet. RESULTS Of 7,366 references screened, only two were eligible for inclusion. Both were retrospective cohort studies without controls. One examined the accuracy of different vital sign trend models using discrete-time survival analysis in 269,999 admissions. One included 44,531 medical admissions examining trend in Vitalpac Early Warning Score weighted vital signs. They stated that vital sign trends increased detection of clinical deterioration. Critical appraisal was performed using evaluation tools. The studies had moderate risk of bias, and a low certainty of evidence. Additionally, four studies examining trends in early warning scores, otherwise eligible for inclusion, were evaluated. CONCLUSIONS This review illustrates a lack of research in intermittently monitored vital sign trends. The included studies, although heterogeneous and imprecise, indicates an added value of trend analysis. This highlights the need for well-controlled trials to thoroughly assess the research question.","Brekke, Idar Johan; Puntervoll, Lars Håland; Pedersen, Peter Bank; Kellett, John; Brabrand, Mikkel",PloS one,486,20

Despite studies showing that both job satisfaction and burnout are effects of exposure to stressful working environments, leading to poor health among nurses, little is known about the causal nature and direction of these relationships. The aim of this systematic review is to identify published research that has formally investigated relationships between these variables. Six databases (including CINAHL, COCHRANE, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PROQUEST and PsyINFO) were searched for combinations of keywords, a manual search was conducted and an independent reviewer was asked to cross validate all the electronically identified articles. Of the eighty five articles that were identified from these databases, twenty one articles were excluded based on exclusion criteria; hence, a total of seventy articles were included in the study sample. The majority of identified studies exploring two and three way relationships (n = 63) were conducted in developed countries. Existing research includes predominantly cross-sectional studies (n = 68) with only a few longitudinal studies (n = 2); hence, the evidence base for causality is still very limited. Despite minimal availability of research concerning the small number of studies to investigate the relationships between work-related stress, burnout, job satisfaction and the general health of nurses, this review has identified some contradictory evidence for the role of job satisfaction. This emphasizes the need for further research towards understanding causality.","Khamisa, Natasha; Peltzer, Karl; Oldenburg, Brian",International journal of environmental research and public health,486,1

These measures may be associated with disruptions to other health services including for gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) at risk for or living with HIV. Here, we assess the relationship between stringency of COVID-19 control measures and interruptions to HIV prevention and treatment services for MSM. SETTING Data for this study were collected between 16-Apr-2020 and 24-May-2020 as part of a COVID-19 Disparities Survey implemented by the gay social networking app, Hornet. Pandemic control measures were quantified using the Oxford Government Response Tracker Stringency Index: each country received a score (0-100) based on the number and strictness of nine indicators related to restrictions, closures, and travel bans. METHODS We used a multilevel mixed-effects generalized linear model with Poisson distribution to assess the association between stringency of pandemic control measures and access to HIV services. RESULTS A total of 10,654 MSM across 20 countries were included. 38% (3992/10396) reported perceived interruptions to in-person testing, 55% (5178/9335) interruptions to HIV self-testing, 56% (5171/9173) interruptions to PrEP, and 10% (990/9542) interruptions to condom access. For every ten-point increase in stringency, there was a 3% reduction in the prevalence of perceived access to in-person testing (aPR: 0·97, 95%CI: [0·96, 0·98]), a 6% reduction in access to self-testing (aPR: 0·94, 95%CI: [0·93, 0·95]), and a 5% reduction in access to PrEP (aPR: 0·95, 95% CI: [0·95, 0·97]). Among those living with HIV, 20% (218/1105) were unable to access their provider; 65% (820/1254) reported being unable to refill their treatment prescription remotely. CONCLUSION More stringent responses were associated with decreased perceived access to services. To minimize increases in HIV-related morbidity and mortality, innovative strategies are needed to minimize service interruptions to the community of gay men and other MSM during this and future waves of COVID-19.","Rao, Amrita; Rucinski, Katherine; Jarrett, Brooke; Ackerman, Benjamin; Wallach, Sara; Marcus, Julia; Adamson, Tyler; Garner, Alex; Santos, Glenn-Milo; Beyrer, Chris; Howell, Sean; Baral, Stefan",Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes,486,1

Splenectomy is a proven method with which to overcome these problems. To investigate the safety and feasibility of synchronous laparoscopic splenectomy and azygoportal disconnection with hepatectomy (LSDH) for treatment of portal hypertension accompanied with HCC, we describe a clinical cohort of 10 patients who underwent a new technique of synchronous LSDH. METHODS A cohort of 10 cirrhotic patients with HCC, esophageal/gastric variceal bleeding, and hypersplenism received LSDH. A 6-port method was used for LSDH. This procedure comprises 5 steps: laparoscopic splenectomy, intraoperative splenic blood salvage, laparoscopic azygoportal disconnection, laparoscopic partial hepatectomy, and removal of spleen and liver specimens. Intraoperative autologous cell salvage was performed before hepatectomy. RESULTS LSDH was successful in all patients. There was no conversion to open operations. The operative time was 220.5 ± 19.8 minutes, blood loss was 264.0 ± 160.3 mL, and postoperative hospital stay was 10.2 ± 1.8 days. CONCLUSIONS Selective synchronous LSDH is a feasible, effective, and safe surgical procedure with satisfactory short-term efficacy.

We specifically focus on children with asthma, cystic fibrosis (CF), and lung transplant recipients. RECENT FINDINGS Children with asthma, CF, and lung transplant recipients do not appear to have an increased risk of morbidity or mortality with COVID-19 infection compared to the general pediatric population. Data does not support the change or withdrawal of any asthma or CF maintenance medications; however, does advocate for the cessation of aerosolized medications whenever possible to minimize transmission risk. It may not be necessary to adjust immunosuppressive therapy when managing COVID-19 in pediatric lung transplant patients. Mechanisms of infection in airway epithelial cells in children may differ from adults, resulting in a milder phenotype. SUMMARY Current data about pediatric patients with chronic lung disease infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is promising but remains scarce. Additional study is needed to definitively understand the complex interplay of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the airway of children with chronic lung disease, how it differs from adults, and how best to manage the symptoms of acute infection.","Palla, John; Laguna, Theresa A",Current opinion in pediatrics,486,1

We performed a systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis to determine the range of liver stiffness in healthy children and evaluate the influence of important biological parameters. METHODS We pooled data from 10 studies that examined healthy children using transient elastography. We divided 1702 children into two groups: ≥ 3 years (older group) and < 3 years of age (younger group). Univariate and multivariate linear regression models predicting liver stiffness were conducted. RESULTS After excluding children with obesity, diabetes, or abnormal liver tests, 652 children were analyzed. Among older children, mean liver stiffness was 4.45 kPa (95% confidence interval 4.34-4.56), and increased liver stiffness was associated with age, sedation status, and S probe use. In the younger group, the mean liver stiffness was 4.79 kPa (95% confidence interval 4.46-5.12), and increased liver stiffness was associated with sedation status and Caucasian race. In a subgroup analysis, hepatic steatosis on ultrasound was significantly associated with increased liver stiffness. We define a reference range for normal liver stiffness in healthy children as 2.45-5.56 kPa. CONCLUSIONS We have established transient elastography-derived liver stiffness ranges for healthy children and propose an upper limit of liver stiffness in healthy children to be 5.56 kPa. We have identified increasing age, use of sedation, probe size and presence of steatosis on ultrasound as factors that can significantly increase liver stiffness.","Li, Darrick K; Rehan Khan, Muhammad; Wang, Zhen; Chongsrisawat, Voranush; Swangsak, Panida; Teufel-Schäfer, Ulrike; Engelmann, Guido; Goldschmidt, Imeke; Baumann, Ulrich; Tokuhara, Daisuke; Cho, Yuki; Rowland, Marion; Mjelle, Anders B; Ramm, Grant A; Lewindon, Peter J; Witters, Peter; Cassiman, David; Ciuca, Ioana M; Prokop, Larry D; Haffar, Samir; Corey, Kathleen E; Hassan Murad, M; Furuya, Katryn N; Bazerbachi, Fateh",Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver,486,17

We conducted a study in technical secondary school and college students before and during the pandemic to explore changes in PLEs and relevant influential factors. METHODS A total of 938 students completed both waves of the survey through electronic questionnaires. PLEs were assessed using the 15-item Positive Subscale of the Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences (CAPE-P15). Childhood trauma, perceived stress, resilience, and demographic factors were evaluated at baseline, and psychological status was measured during the pandemic. RESULTS The overall CAPE-P15 scores significantly decreased during the pandemic. Students with persistent PLEs showed the most severe COVID-19 related psychological symptoms, followed by new-onset and remitted individuals; those without PLEs exhibited the mildest symptoms (all p < .001). A single parent family (OR = 4.707), more childhood trauma (OR = 1.056), and a higher family income (OR = 1.658) were predictive of new-onset PLEs during the pandemic, while better resilience was a protective factor, associated with remission of previous PLEs (OR = 0.932). CONCLUSIONS Despite a downward trend in the prevalence of PLEs during the pandemic, PLEs predict greater serious psychological impact due to COVID-19, especially for students with persistent PLEs.

However, the noise level has not been measured digitally. METHODS We evaluated 3 types of HFNCs without filters and 2 types with filters attached for noise reduction. Optiflow (with and without a filter), MaxVenturi (with and without a filter) and AIRVO2 (without a filter only) were positioned at the center of a hospital room. We measured the noise levels at the distance of 1 m from the equipment at various total flows (30, 40, 50, 60 L/min) and FIO2 (0.40, 0.60, and 0.90). RESULTS Noise levels were increased with the AIRVO2 and MaxVenturi when total flow and FIO2 were increased. Noise levels decreased with the MaxVenturi when a filter was used. The noise level did not change with the Optiflow when total flow and FIO2 were increased. The noise level decreased in the groups with AIRVO2 and Optiflow compared with MaxVenturi without a filter. CONCLUSIONS The findings in this study show that the noise level of HFNC/Venturi could be reduced by attaching an intake filter. However, the noise level of HFNC/blender and HFNC/turbine decreased in comparison with HFNC/Venturi without an intake filter.","Kubo, Takamitsu; Nakajima, Hiroaki; Shimoda, Ryo; Seo, Tatsuya; Kanno, Yurie; Kondo, Toshikazu; Tamai, Sunao",Respiratory care,486,7

Current evidence regarding the effect of funeral practices on bereaved relatives' mental health and bereavement outcomes is inconclusive. Five observational studies found benefits from funeral participation while six did not. However, qualitative research provides additional insight: the benefit of after-death rituals including funerals depends on the ability of the bereaved to shape those rituals and say goodbye in a way which is meaningful for them.

Recognizing viral PTMs is very important for a better understanding of the mechanism of viral infections and finding potential drug targets. However, few studies have investigated the roles of viral PTMs in virus-human interactions using comprehensive viral PTM datasets. To fill this gap, we developed the first comprehensive viral posttranslational modification database (VPTMdb) for collecting systematic information of PTMs in human viruses and infected host cells. The VPTMdb contains 1240 unique viral PTM sites with 8 modification types from 43 viruses (818 experimentally verified PTM sites manually extracted from 150 publications and 422 PTMs extracted from SwissProt) as well as 13 650 infected cells' PTMs extracted from seven global proteomics experiments in six human viruses. The investigation of viral PTM sequences motifs showed that most viral PTMs have the consensus motifs with human proteins in phosphorylation and five cellular kinase families phosphorylate more than 10 viral species. The analysis of protein disordered regions presented that more than 50% glycosylation sites of double-strand DNA viruses are in the disordered regions, whereas single-strand RNA and retroviruses prefer ordered regions. Domain-domain interaction analysis indicating potential roles of viral PTMs play in infections. The findings should make an important contribution to the field of virus-human interaction. Moreover, we created a novel sequence-based classifier named VPTMpre to help users predict viral protein phosphorylation sites.

The patient's quality of life rapidly deteriorates, resulting in a dismal prognosis. Stomach-partitioning gastrojejunostomy has been previously reported, and here, we evaluate the laparoscopic procedure. METHODS We performed laparoscopic stomach-partitioning gastrojejunostomy in 18 patients with unresectable gastroduodenal or periampullary cancers. Data on operation time, blood loss, complications, and postoperative course were retrospectively collected. RESULTS The mean operation time was 152 min, and conversion to open surgery was not required in any patients. Postoperative complications occurred in three patients (17%) and included cholangitis, anastomotic ulcer hemorrhage, and enterocolitis. The mean time to oral intake was 4.5 days, and the mean and median duration of oral intake were maintained for 133 and 88 days, respectively. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic stomach-partitioning gastrojejunostomy is a safe and effective procedure that allows patients with gastroduodenal outlet obstruction to eat again and improve the quality of their remaining life.","Eguchi, Hidetoshi; Yada, Kazuhiro; Shibata, Kohei; Matsumoto, Toshifumi; Etoh, Tsuyoshi; Yasuda, Kazuhiro; Inomata, Masafumi; Shiraishi, Norio; Ohta, Masayuki; Kitano, Seigo",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,486,17

Exploring the immune-inflammatory characteristics of COVID-19 patients is essential to reveal pathogenesis and predict progression. In this study, COVID-19 patients showed decreased CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells but increased neutrophils in circulation, exhibiting upregulated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte and neutrophil-to-CD8+ T cell ratio. IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-18, IL-12/IL-23p40, IL-10, Tim-3, IL-8, neutrophil extracellular trap-related proteinase 3, and S100A8/A9 were elevated, whereas IFN-γ and C-type lectin domain family 9 member A (clec9A) were decreased in COVID-19 patients compared with healthy controls. When compared with influenza patients, the expressions of TNF-α, IL-18, IL-12/IL-23p40, IL-8, S100A8/A9 and Tim-3 were significantly increased in critical COVID-19 patients, and carcinoembryonic Ag, IL-8, and S100A8/A9 could serve as clinically available hematologic indexes for identifying COVID-19 from influenza. Moreover, IL-6, IL-8, IL-1β, TNF-α, proteinase 3, and S100A8/A9 were increased in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of severe/critical patients compared with moderate patients, despite decreased CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells, and NK cells. Interestingly, bronchoalveolar IL-6, carcinoembryonic Ag, IL-8, S100A8/A9, and proteinase 3 were found to be predictive of COVID-19 severity and may serve as potential biomarkers for predicting COVID-19 progression and potential targets in therapeutic intervention of COVID-19.","Huang, Wei; Li, Mei; Luo, Guangwei; Wu, Xiaojie; Su, Bintao; Zhao, Lan; Zhang, Shuang; Chen, Xiaofan; Jia, Min; Zhu, Jianhua; Su, Wen; Zhang, Dongxin",Journal of immunology,486,12

The hepatitis B virus-encoded HBx oncoprotein is known to perform an overwhelming array of functions in the cell and has been implicated in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. However, its structure has not been elucidated. HBx carries nine conserved cysteine residues that have proven to be crucial for its various functions. However, the status of disulfide bonds between the cysteine residues reported in previous studies remains discrepant because of the use of refolded recombinant HBx that may contain non-native disulfides. Now we have determined the disulfide linkages in soluble and biologically active recombinant maltose binding protein-HBx fusion protein using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. We report four disulfide linkages in HBx protein, viz., between Cys(7) and Cys(69), Cys(61) and Cys(115), Cys(78) and Cys(137), and Cys(17) and Cys(143), based on the differential mobility of corresponding disulfide-linked peptide ions under reducing and nonreducing conditions. Cys(148) was observed to be free. Site-directed mutagenesis of Cys(143) and Cys(148) with serine and functional analyses of these mutants affirmed the importance of these residues in the ability of HBx to potentiate Cdk2/cyclin E kinase activity and transcriptionally activate promoter reporter gene activity. Thus, this study identifies native disulfide linkages in the structure of a biologically active viral oncoprotein.","Sidhu, Kaveri; Kumar, Saravanan; Reddy, Vanga Siva; Kumar, Vijay",Biochemistry,486,1

Using Registry data, we evaluated the frequency of concurrent venous thromboembolism in cancer patients prior to treatment initiation by cancer type. METHODS The Cancer-VTE Registry is an ongoing (March 2017-September 2020) prospective cohort study using a nationwide, multicentre clinical registry. Participants aged ≥20 years with colorectal, lung, stomach, pancreatic, breast or gynecologic cancer, confirmed staging, ≥6 months life expectancy post-registration and who had undergone venous thromboembolism screening were managed with routine clinical care. Venous thromboembolism frequency at registration was evaluated. RESULTS Of 9735 participants, 571 (5.9%) had venous thromboembolism at baseline, including asymptomatic [5.5% (n = 540)] and symptomatic venous thromboembolism [0.3% (n = 31)]. Most participants with venous thromboembolism (n = 506, 5.2%) had deep vein thrombosis only; 65 (0.7%) had pulmonary embolism with/without deep vein thrombosis. The prevalence of distal and proximal deep vein thrombosis was 4.8% (n = 466) and 0.9% (n = 83), respectively. The highest prevalence of venous thromboembolism was for pancreatic cancer (8.5%) and the lowest for breast cancer (2.0%). Venous thromboembolism prevalence increased as cancer stage advanced. CONCLUSIONS Although there was a marked difference in venous thromboembolism by cancer type, the data suggest that cancer stage is an important risk factor for venous thromboembolism. Thus, metastasis seems a critical risk factor for venous thromboembolism. This is the first demonstration of venous thromboembolism prevalence and risk factors in Japanese cancer patients prior to treatment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Five computed tomography acquisitions from a previous animal study on computed tomography-guided percutaneous applicator positioning for microwave antenna were reconstructed with 6 different algorithms (30 image series total): standard filtered backprojection (B30f) and iterative reconstruction (ADMIRE-I30-1, ADMIRE-I30-3), all with and without metal artifact reduction. For artifact quantification, 3-dimensional segmentation of liver parenchyma without visible artifacts (VLiverReference) and liver volume surrounding the antenna (VLiverVOI) was performed, determining thresholds for artifact segmentation and calculating volume of voxels influenced by artifacts. Objective image analysis was based on relative volume of artifacts, and subjective image quality (ie, metal artifact extent) was evaluated by 2 independent observers. Correlation between objective and subjective evaluation was calculated. RESULTS Both objective and subjective evaluations showed a significant reduction in metal artifacts when using dedicated metal artifact reduction algorithms (both P < 0.05). No significant reduction in metal artifacts was found when using iterative reconstruction (both P > 0.05). A good correlation between subjective and objective image quality was found (Spearman rank correlation coefficient rs = 0.65; P < 0.05). Interreader agreement was substantial (κ = 0.67). CONCLUSIONS Segmentation-based objective evaluation of metal artifacts shows good agreement with conventional subjective evaluations and offers a promising quantitative and precise approach with limited time expenditure.","Do, Thuy D; Sommer, Christof M; Melzig, Claudius; Nattenmüller, Johanna; Vollherbst, Dominik; Kauczor, Hans-Ulrich; Stiller, Wolfram; Skornitzke, Stephan",Investigative radiology,486,19

However, an extremely rare cause of fat necrosis is calciphylaxis, a calcification of small- and medium-sized arteries causing thrombosis and ischemia. It is classified into (A) uremic (B) nonuremic-induced calciphylaxis. Calciphylaxis has been reported to be encountered in different parts of the body. However, to the best of our knowledge there is only one case in the English literature of BFN 2ry to warfarin-induced calciphylaxis. We report a 65-year-old female, known case of atrial fibrillation on warfarin, presented with a left breast mass of 4-month duration. The mass was painful and progressively enlarging. Examination of the left breast showed 7 × 4 cm mass, spanning from 10-2 o'clock, free from surrounding structures, with preserved overlying skin. However, the mass was not visualized on mammogram. Ultrasound showed a left breast lobulated hypoechoic mass containing a hyperechoic component. Biopsy showed fat necrosis. After 1 month, she presented with ulceration of the overlying skin. After wide local excision, histopathology demonstrated a calciphylaxis-induced fat necrosis. Considering the patient's background, the diagnosis was BFN secondary to warfarin-induced calciphylaxis. Hence, the warfarin was shifted to Rivaroxaban, 6 months follow-up showed no evidence of recurrence. In conclusion, the rarity of nonuremic calciphylaxis is reflected on the delay of diagnosis in some of the reported cases and the lack of grading system used to guide the management of such difficult wounds. However, keeping a high index of suspicion is important whenever such wounds are encountered with presence of risk factors other than end-stage kidney disease.","AlQattan, Abdullah Saleh; Ghulam, Weaam Zohier; Aldaoud, Najla; Algheryafi, Lama; Aleisa, Nadia; Aldulaijan, Fozan A",The breast journal,486,16
94964,94964,94964,Human rhinovirus species and season of infection determine illness severity.,19.15549,12.408074,2012,"BACKGROUND Currently, the majority cases of the novel down-to-up transanal total mesorectal excision (TaTME) were performed in a hybrid approach with conventional laparoscopic assistance because of less operative difficulty. However, although cases are limited, the successes of TaTME in a pure approach (without laparoscopic assistance) indicate that the costly and less mini-invasive hybrid TaTME could be potentially avoided. METHODS In the present single institutional, prospective study, we attempted to demonstrate the safety and feasibility of this approach in rectal cancer by evaluating the short-term results of our first 20 TaTME cases. For the majority of cases, we adopted a strategy that laparoscopic assistance was not introduced unless it was required during the planned pure TaTME procedure. RESULTS A total of 20 patients (12 males and 8 females) were analyzed in this study, including 11 cases (55 %) of pure TaTME and 9 cases (45 %) of hybrid TaTME. Overall, the median operative time was 200 min (range 70-420), along with a median estimated blood loss of 50 ml (range 20-800). Morbidity rate was 20 % (one urethral injury, two urinary retentions, one anastomotic hemorrhage and one mild anastomotic leak). The median number of harvested lymph nodes was 12 (range 1-20). All specimens were intact in mesorectum without positive distal and circumferential resection margins. Among the 15 patients who were preoperatively scheduled to undertake pure TaTME, four patients (26.7 %) required converting to laparoscopic assistance. Moreover, among these 15 patients, the results of the comparative analysis between female and male subgroups favor the former, suggesting easier operation in them. CONCLUSION This preliminary study demonstrates that TaTME in rectal cancer is safe and feasible. The strategy of not introducing laparoscopic assistance unless it is required while performing the planned pTaTME should be cautiously explored. Further studies with larger sample size and longer follow-up are warranted.","Kang, Liang; Chen, Wen-Hao; Luo, Shuang-Ling; Luo, Yan-Xin; Liu, Zhi-Hua; Huang, Mei-Jin; Wang, Jian-Ping",Surgical endoscopy,486,31

BACKGROUND Disease disclosure is a critical component of prevention and control of a virus outbreak, and this is especially true during the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding COVID patients' experiences and perspectives on disclosure could play a vital role in COVID management. DESIGN A qualitative study. METHODS A semi-structured interview guide was used to conduct qualitative in-depth interviews from April to June 2020. All the interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed and then a thematic analysis was conducted. The Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research (SRQR) were applied to this study. RESULTS A total of 26 COVID-confirmed patients were recruited for the in-depth interviews. Four themes emerged from the thematic analysis on disclosure: persons disclosed to, reasons for disclosure, reasons for nondisclosure, and impact of disclosure. The participants disclosed their COVID diagnosis to different groups, including family, close friends, community members, and workplace contacts. The main reasons for disclosure included: government policy, social responsibility, gaining support, and fear of being blamed for nondisclosure. However, some participants decided not to disclose to some groups for fear of facing stigma and discrimination or to protect family members from discrimination. Despite the potential benefits of obtaining support after disclosure, many participants did experience stigma and discrimination, privacy exposure, psychological distress, and social isolation. CONCLUSIONS An individual's decision as to whether to disclose their COVID-positive status is affected by many factors. To prevent the spread of COVID-19 and reduce the potential risks of disclosure, such as discrimination and privacy exposure, a balanced intervention should be designed to protect COVID patients and to secure any contact tracing. Therefore, the chances of discrimination could be decreased and patients' confidentiality could be protected. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE As the number of COVID patients increases, disclosure of an individual's infectious status is encouraged by health departments. Despite the potential benefits of disclosure, discrimination and privacy exposure should not be ignored. A disclosure protocol is necessary to ensure patients' privacy regarding their COVID status.","Sun, Wenxiu; Zhou, Ying; Chen, Wei-Ti; Huang, Feifei; Sun, Meiyan; Shen, Lei; Gao, Yan; Zhang, Qing; Ma, Siyue; Shiu, Cheng-Shi; Zhang, Lin; Lu, Hongzhou",Journal of clinical nursing,486,8

RESULTS The overall incidence of post-operative cerebrospinal fluid leak was 10.8 per cent. Seventy-five per cent of patients who had a post-operative cerebrospinal fluid leak underwent a transclival approach (p < 0.05). All patients with clival pathology who underwent an intradural dissection had a post-operative cerebrospinal fluid leak (p < 0.05).

There is a relevant gap between the legal framework and the actual state of implementation. Healthcare providers play an important role in this implementation process as they are increasingly confronted with the application of telemedical scenarios. Therefore, the aim of this survey was to determine attitudes towards telemedicine of postgraduate trainees in Family Medicine (FM) in Germany. METHODS A cross-sectional survey was conducted between July and October 2016 among postgraduate trainees in FM throughout Germany. The questionnaire covered four topics: attitudes towards telemedicine, barriers for the implementation of telemedicine, assessment of useful telemedical applications and telemedicine scenarios. A descriptive approach was used to analyze the data in order to derive determinants for the implementation of telemedicine. RESULTS In total, 388 postgraduate trainees from 13 of the 16 federal states in Germany answered the survey. Seventy-eight percent were female. Participants' mean age was 36 years. The majority of participants believed that only a fraction of the already existing technology in telemedicine is being used (70 %). The largest perceived barrier to telemedicine was data safety concerns. More than half of the participants (54 %) believed that telemedicine would change the doctor-patient relationship. 51 % of the participants were interested in training in telemedicine. In this respect, it is important to note that 27 % of the postgraduate trainees said their willingness to practice in rural areas might be facilitated through the availability of telemedical backup for family physicians. CONCLUSIONS Participating trainees in FM in Germany think that the potential for telemedicine is not yet fully exploited. Based on the results of this survey the next steps to be taken for the implementation of telemedicine applications can be addressed.","Waschkau, Alexander; Flägel, Kristina; Goetz, Katja; Steinhäuser, Jost","Zeitschrift fur Evidenz, Fortbildung und Qualitat im Gesundheitswesen",486,1

BTB and CNC homology1 (Bach1) is a regulator of oxidative stress and participates in the pathogenesis of multiple lung diseases. Thus, this study aimed to determine the effect of Bach1 knockdown on fibrosis and inflammation in pulmonary fibrosis (PF) mice and cell models. METHODS Bleomycin induced PF mice were constructed and treated with Bach1 siRNA adenovirus (BLM + Bach1 siRNA group), control siRNA adenovirus (BLM + Control siRNA group) or normal saline (BLM group), then lung tissues were collected for Bach1 expression detection, H&E staining and Masson's trichrome staining. Afterwards, collagen type I alpha 1 chain (COL1A1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) expressions in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were examined. Subsequently, mouse lung fibroblasts (MLFs) were collected from PF mice and treated with TGF-β1 to construct PF cell model, which was treated with Bach1 siRNA adenovirus (TGF-β1 + Bach1 siRNA group) and MAP kinase (ERK) inhibitor U0126 alone (TGF-β1 + U0126 group) or in combination (TGF-β1 + U0126 + Bach1 siRNA group), then alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), fibronectin 1 (Fn1), COL1A1, IL-6 expressions and cell viability were detected. RESULTS Lung tissue Bach1 mRNA and protein expressions were upregulated in PF mice compared to control mice. Bach1 knockdown reduced lung fibrosis (displayed by Masson's trichrome staining) and inflammation (displayed by H&E staining), then downregulated serum and BALF expressions of COL1A1 and IL-6 in PF mice. Subsequently, in PF cell model, Bach1 knockdown blocked ERK pathway, but did not affect Smads, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) or thymoma viral proto-oncogene 1 (Akt) pathways. Further experiments revealed that Bach1 knockdown repressed cell viability, α-SMA, Fn1, IL-6 and COL1A1 expressions in PF cell model, then ERK inhibition by U0126 enhanced these effects. CONCLUSIONS Bach1 is involved in the PF pathogenesis via modulating ERK signaling pathway.","Liu, Yuan; Wang, Yongfu; Lu, Fuai; Wang, Le; Miao, Liu; Wang, Xiaoyuan",Experimental lung research,486,1

Outbreaks were expected at each phase. One week after Phase Two of reopening in the provincial public health administration region of Kingston, Frontenac, Lennox and Addington (KFL&A), a positive case was reported after three weeks of zero new COVID-19 cases. The objective of this report is to describe this COVID-19 outbreak, linked to a personal service setting (PSS), and the public health response to contain the outbreak. Methods The outbreak investigation included all COVID-19 cases in KFL&A between June 20, 2020 and July 3, 2020. Public health inspectors and nurses were rapidly deployed to inspect the PSS. A multimodal approach to high-volume testing involved fixed assessment centres, drive-through testing capacity and targeted testing at the outbreak site. Testing was conducted through a real-time polymerase chain reaction assay at the local Public Health Ontario laboratory. Results Thirty-seven cases were associated with the outbreak: 38% through direct PSS exposure; 32% through household contact; and 30% through social and workplace contact. A superspreading event contributed to 38% of total cases. The majority of cases were in the low to mid-quintiles when analyzed for material deprivation. Testing rates increased four-fold compared to the prior baseline weeks in response to media attention and public health messaging, resulting in a low percent positivity. Conclusion The interplay of aggressive accessible testing, quick lab turnaround time, contact tracing within 24 hours of positive laboratory results as per provincial standards, frequent public communication, rapid inspections, mandatory self-isolation and face coverings were measures successful in halting the outbreak. Inspections or self-audits should be required at all PSSs prior to reopening and outbreak management must work with PSSs to reduce the possibility of superspreading events.","Li, Anthony; Parent, Stéphanie; Kasmani, Azim; Guan, T Hugh; Moore, Kieran",Canada communicable disease report = Releve des maladies transmissibles au Canada,486,1

Large quantities of PPE were introduced into US stockpiles because of the need to protect healthcare and other professionals during these events. Because most stockpiled PPE was acquired during, or immediately following, large-scale public health events, such as pandemic influenza planning (2005-20080), SARS (2003), H1N1 (2009-10), and Ebola (2014-15), aging PPE poses a significant problem. PPE such as N95 filtering face piece respirators were not designed to be stored for long periods, and much of the currently stored PPE has exceeded its manufacturer-assigned shelf life. Given the significant investment in the procurement and storage of PPE, along with projections of consumption during public health emergencies, discarding large quantities of potentially viable PPE is not an attractive option. Although shelf-life extension programs exist for other stockpiled medical assets, no such option is currently available for stockpiled PPE. This article posits stockpile quality assurance sampling plans as a mechanism through which shelf-life extension programs for stockpiled PPE may be achieved. We discuss some of the nuances that should be considered when developing a plan tailored to stockpiles and provide basic decision tools that may be used in the context of a quality assurance program tailored to stockpiled PPE.

METHODS Descriptive analysis of a nationally representative 5% random sample of anonymized, longitudinal, individual-level prescription claims from IQVIA LRx between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2016 among individuals ages 18 years or older that used a retail pharmacy. High-risk opioid use was defined as ≥50 morphine milligram equivalents per day and/or having concurrent dispensing of a benzodiazepine based on overlapping days of coverage. RESULTS The prevalence of high-risk opioid use among adults in the U.S. decreased from 12.0% in 2011 to 9.4% in 2016 (p < 0.01). Declines were most pronounced among individuals ages 18 to 35 years (10.9% to 7.0%, 36.2% decline; p < 0.01) compared to individuals age 65 years or greater (10.5% to 9.8%, 6.7% decline; p < 0.01). Declines in high-risk use prevalence were observed across 49 states, with only South Dakota experiencing an increase (+13.7% relative increase). Similar to earlier years, in 2016 50.9% of all high-risk use opioid users received all their opioid prescriptions from a single prescriber, and 71.1% used a single pharmacy to fill them. CONCLUSION Despite clinically significant declines in high-risk opioid use, in 2016 nearly 1 in 10 adult retail pharmacy users remained at high-risk for opioid overdose in the U.S. Future clinical and policy interventions should consider targeting older adults with Medicare Part-D, including those using a single pharmacy to fill their opioid prescriptions.

The most common mutation responsible for the onset of cystic fibrosis (CF), F508del, inhibits the biosynthesis and transport of the protein at PM, and also presents gating and stability defects of the membrane anion channel upon its rescue by the use of correctors and potentiators. This prompted a multiple drug strategy for F508delCFTR aimed simultaneously at its rescue, functional potentiation and PM stabilization. Since ganglioside GM1 is involved in the functional stabilization of transmembrane proteins, we investigated its role as an adjuvant to increase the effectiveness of CFTR modulators. According to our results, we found that GM1 resides in the same PM microenvironment as CFTR. In CF cells, the expression of the mutated channel is accompanied by a decrease in the PM GM1 content. Interestingly, by the exogenous administration of GM1, it becomes a component of the PM, reducing the destabilizing effect of the potentiator VX-770 on rescued CFTR protein expression/function and improving its stabilization. This evidence could represent a starting point for developing innovative therapeutic strategies based on the co-administration of GM1, correctors and potentiators, with the aim of improving F508del CFTR function.","Mancini, Giulia; Loberto, Nicoletta; Olioso, Debora; Dechecchi, Maria Cristina; Cabrini, Giulio; Mauri, Laura; Bassi, Rosaria; Schiumarini, Domitilla; Chiricozzi, Elena; Lippi, Giuseppe; Pesce, Emanuela; Sonnino, Sandro; Pedemonte, Nicoletta; Tamanini, Anna; Aureli, Massimo",International journal of molecular sciences,486,31

The focus here is on the biggest killers, plague, typhus, smallpox, tuberculosis, cholera, typhoid, dysentery, childhood infections, pneumonia, and influenza. Many other infectious diseases including puerperal fever, relapsing fever, malaria, syphilis, meningitis, tetanus and gangrene caused thousands of deaths. This review of preventive measures, public health interventions and changes in behavior that reduced the risk of severe infections puts the response to recent epidemic challenges in historical perspective. Two new respiratory viruses have recently caused pandemics: an H1N1 influenza virus genetically related to pig viruses, and a bat-derived coronavirus causing COVID-19. Studies of infectious diseases emerging in human populations in recent decades indicate that the majority were zoonotic, and many of the causal pathogens had a wildlife origin. As hunter-gatherers, humans contracted pathogens from other species, and then from domesticated animals and rodents when they began to live in settled communities based on agriculture. In the modern world of large inter-connected urban populations and rapid transport, the risk of global transmission of new infectious diseases is high. Past and recent experience indicates that surveillance, prevention and control of infectious diseases are critical for global health. Effective interventions are required to control activities that risk dangerous pathogens transferring to humans from wild animals and those reared for food.","Mercer, Alexander",Pathogens and global health,486,5

The detailed clinical features and virological data of pediatric COVID-19 patients, particularly young infants, remain unclear. Here, the clinical and virological characteristics of 4 children with COVID-19 including two young infants were investigated. One- and 4-month-old boys with COVID-19 were both asymptomatic, and seroconversion was demonstrated. These findings suggest that even young infants can mount an immune response against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), despite having weaker immune defenses than adolescents and adults. Three-year-old boy, who was SARS-CoV-2-negative, was admitted to the same room as his SARS-CoV-2-positive father due to the lack of caregivers. Although he was asymptomatic, he had seroconverted to SARS-CoV-2. Eleven-year-old boy, who was sibling of the 3-year-old boy, was also SARS-CoV-2-negative. He was isolated in his own room and did not seroconvert. If young children are SARS-CoV-2 negative, they should be isolated from their SARS-CoV-2-positive parents. This may be difficult in practice, if parents with COVID-19 are the only available caregivers. In such situations, the most appropriate measures should be taken for each patient.

Patients with relevant symptoms and all patients hospitalized in an intensive care unit (ICU) were invited for further assessment at an ambulatory care visit. Exposures Survival of hospitalization for COVID-19. Main Outcomes and Measures Respiratory, cognitive, and functional symptoms were assessed by telephone with the Q3PC cognitive screening questionnaire and a checklist of symptoms. At the ambulatory care visit, patients underwent pulmonary function tests, lung computed tomographic scan, psychometric and cognitive tests (including the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey and 20-item Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory), and, for patients who had been hospitalized in the ICU or reported ongoing symptoms, echocardiography. Results Among 834 eligible patients, 478 were evaluated by telephone (mean age, 61 years [SD, 16 years]; 201 men, 277 women). During the telephone interview, 244 patients (51%) declared at least 1 symptom that did not exist before COVID-19: fatigue in 31%, cognitive symptoms in 21%, and new-onset dyspnea in 16%. There was further evaluation in 177 patients (37%), including 97 of 142 former ICU patients. The median 20-item Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory score (n = 130) was 4.5 (interquartile range, 3.0-5.0) for reduced motivation and 3.7 (interquartile range, 3.0-4.5) for mental fatigue (possible range, 1 [best] to 5 [worst]).

Serology was positive in 172 of 177 outpatients (97%). Conclusions and Relevance Four months after hospitalization for COVID-19, a cohort of patients frequently reported symptoms not previously present, and lung-scan abnormalities were common among those who were tested. These findings are limited by the absence of a control group and of pre-COVID assessments in this cohort.

Prevalence of CCV antibodies also declined during the 6-yr study with high prevalence during spring 2006-08 (80%, n=24) and low prevalence during spring 2009-11 (4%, n=24). Prevalence of N. caninum and T. gondii antibodies were highly variable in the study area during 2006-11.

Performance of rMLA was evaluated by comparing with real-time RT-PCR. Detection data from clinical specimens showed that the rMLA had diagnostic sensitivities of 97.10% for FluA, 94.59% for FluB, 98.68% for PIV-3, 94.87% for RSV and 95.92% for MPV (No Data for MERS-CoV due to the lack of positive specimens). Data of analytical sensitivities showed that the detection limits of the rMLA assay were 5-25 viral RNA copies per μl for FluA, FluB, PIV-3 and MERS-CoV, approximate to the real-time RT-PCR assay; while the values were 8 and 22copies/μl for MPV and RSV, lower than the real-time RT-PCR(78 and 114 copies/μl respectively). The results indicated that the rMLA is a sensitive, specific detection tool and comparable to real-time RT-PCR, especially suitable for high-throughput detection of respiratory specimens.","Yan, Yong; Luo, Jian-Yong; Chen, Yin; Wang, Heng-Hui; Zhu, Guo-Ying; He, Pei-Yan; Guo, Jin-Lei; Lei, Yong-Liang; Chen, Zhong-Wen",Oncotarget,486,11

119763,119763,119763,In Response.,19.289467,12.153565,2018,"BACKGROUND Convalescent plasma and hyperimmune immunoglobulin may reduce mortality in patients with viral respiratory diseases, and are currently being investigated in trials as potential therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A thorough understanding of the current body of evidence regarding the benefits and risks is required. OBJECTIVES: To continually assess, as more evidence becomes available, whether convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin transfusion is effective and safe in treatment of people with COVID-19. SEARCH METHODS We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 Global Research Database, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 Research Article Database and trial registries to identify completed and ongoing studies on 19 August 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA We followed standard Cochrane methodology. We included studies evaluating convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin for people with COVID-19, irrespective of study design, disease severity, age, gender or ethnicity. We excluded studies including populations with other coronavirus diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)) and studies evaluating standard immunoglobulin. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess bias in included studies, we used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' 2.0 tool for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), the Risk of Bias in Non-randomised Studies - of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool for controlled non-randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs), and the assessment criteria for observational studies, provided by Cochrane Childhood Cancer for non-controlled NRSIs. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the following outcomes: all-cause mortality at hospital discharge, mortality (time to event), improvement of clinical symptoms (7, 15, and 30 days after transfusion), grade 3 and 4 adverse events (AEs), and serious adverse events (SAEs). MAIN RESULTS This is the second living update of our review. We included 19 studies (2 RCTs, 8 controlled NRSIs, 9 non-controlled NRSIs) with 38,160 participants, of whom 36,081 received convalescent plasma. Two completed RCTs are awaiting assessment (published after 19 August 2020). We identified a further 138 ongoing studies evaluating convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin, of which 73 are randomised (3 reported in a study registry as already being completed, but without results). We did not identify any completed studies evaluating hyperimmune immunoglobulin. We did not include data from controlled NRSIs in data synthesis because of critical risk of bias. The overall certainty of evidence was low to very low, due to study limitations and results including both potential benefits and harms. Effectiveness of convalescent plasma for people with COVID-19 We included results from two RCTs (both stopped early) with 189 participants, of whom 95 received convalescent plasma. Control groups received standard care at time of treatment without convalescent plasma. We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma decreases all-cause mortality at hospital discharge (risk ratio (RR) 0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 1.34; 1 RCT, 86 participants; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma decreases mortality (time to event) (hazard ratio (HR) 0.64, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.25; 2 RCTs, 189 participants; low-certainty evidence). Convalescent plasma may result in little to no difference in improvement of clinical symptoms (i.e. need for respiratory support) at seven days (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.30 to 3.19; 1 RCT, 103 participants; low-certainty evidence). Convalescent plasma may increase improvement of clinical symptoms at up to 15 days (RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.85 to 2.11; 2 RCTs, 189 participants; low-certainty evidence), and at up to 30 days (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.43; 2 studies, 188 participants; low-certainty evidence). No studies reported on quality of life. Safety of convalescent plasma for people with COVID-19 We included results from two RCTs, eight controlled NRSIs and nine non-controlled NRSIs assessing safety of convalescent plasma. Reporting of safety data and duration of follow-up was variable. The controlled studies reported on AEs and SAEs only in participants receiving convalescent plasma. Some, but not all, studies included death as a SAE. The studies did not report the grade of AEs. Fourteen studies (566 participants) reported on AEs of possible grade 3 or 4 severity. The majority of these AEs were allergic or respiratory events. We are very uncertain whether convalescent plasma therapy affects the risk of moderate to severe AEs (very low-certainty evidence). 17 studies (35,944 participants) assessed SAEs for 20,622 of its participants. The majority of participants were from one non-controlled NRSI (20,000 participants), which reported on SAEs within the first four hours and within an additional seven days after transfusion. There were 63 deaths, 12 were possibly and one was probably related to transfusion. There were 146 SAEs within four hours and 1136 SAEs within seven days post-transfusion. These were predominantly allergic or respiratory, thrombotic or thromboembolic and cardiac events. We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma therapy results in a clinically relevant increased risk of SAEs (low-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma is beneficial for people admitted to hospital with COVID-19. There was limited information regarding grade 3 and 4 AEs to determine the effect of convalescent plasma therapy on clinically relevant SAEs. In the absence of a control group, we are unable to assess the relative safety of convalescent plasma therapy. While major efforts to conduct research on COVID-19 are being made, recruiting the anticipated number of participants into these studies is problematic. The early termination of the first two RCTs investigating convalescent plasma, and the lack of data from 20 studies that have completed or were due to complete at the time of this update illustrate these challenges. Well-designed studies should be prioritised. Moreover, studies should report outcomes in the same way, and should consider the importance of maintaining comparability in terms of co-interventions administered in all study arms. There are 138 ongoing studies evaluating convalescent plasma and hyperimmune immunoglobulin, of which 73 are RCTs (three already completed). This is the second living update of the review, and we will continue to update this review periodically. Future updates may show different results to those reported here.","Chai, Khai Li; Valk, Sarah J; Piechotta, Vanessa; Kimber, Catherine; Monsef, Ina; Doree, Carolyn; Wood, Erica M; Lamikanra, Abigail A; Roberts, David J; McQuilten, Zoe; So-Osman, Cynthia; Estcourt, Lise J; Skoetz, Nicole",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,486,16

Multiple predisposing factors (for example, pre-existing cognitive impairment) and precipitating factors (for example, urinary tract infection) for delirium have been described, with most patients having both types. Because multiple factors are implicated in the aetiology of delirium, there are likely several neurobiological processes that contribute to delirium pathogenesis, including neuroinflammation, brain vascular dysfunction, altered brain metabolism, neurotransmitter imbalance and impaired neuronal network connectivity. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5) is the most commonly used diagnostic system upon which a reference standard diagnosis is made, although many other delirium screening tools have been developed given the impracticality of using the DSM-5 in many settings. Pharmacological treatments for delirium (such as antipsychotic drugs) are not effective, reflecting substantial gaps in our understanding of its pathophysiology. Currently, the best management strategies are multidomain interventions that focus on treating precipitating conditions, medication review, managing distress, mitigating complications and maintaining engagement to environmental issues. The effective implementation of delirium detection, treatment and prevention strategies remains a major challenge for health-care organizations globally.","Wilson, Jo Ellen; Mart, Matthew F; Cunningham, Colm; Shehabi, Yahya; Girard, Timothy D; MacLullich, Alasdair M J; Slooter, Arjen J C; Ely, E Wesley",Nature reviews.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Six electronic databases and partial gray literature were searched without date or language restrictions until September 2020. Prospective and retrospective observational cohort and case-control studies were included. The risk of bias (RoB) was assessed using the checklists from the Joanna Briggs Institute and the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE tool. To complement the case-control studies, the odds ratio (OR) of the individuals with allergies/asthma to develop root resorption was calculated. RESULTS Six studies were included. One study with low RoB, one with moderate, and one with high RoB stated that allergic patients did not report a greater chance of developing OIIRR (OR = 1.17 to 2.10, p = 0.1 to 1), while only one study with low RoB reported that individuals with allergies tend to develop root resorption (OR = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.08-5.37). Three studies with low RoB and one with moderate showed no significant association between asthma and OIIRR (OR = 1.05 to 3.42, p = 0.12 to 0.94). No association was identified between the type of malocclusion and the degree of OIIRR. Uniradicular dental units and a prolonged treatment time seem to be associated with an increased risk of resorption. The certainty of the evidence was considered low for both exposure factors. CONCLUSION Evidence with a low level of certainty indicates that individuals with allergies or asthma are not more predisposed to OIIRR. Uniradicular teeth and long-term orthodontic treatments are associated with a higher risk of OIIRR.

Cancer survivors with mental health conditions incurred significantly higher total medical costs and costs of most service types compared to cancer survivors without a mental health condition. Additionally, the total healthcare expenditure related to mental health was higher among cancer survivors compared with people without history of cancer. EXPERT COMMENTARY Mental health conditions are associated with increased healthcare costs among cancer survivors. Future examination of other components of economic burden, including patient out-of-pocket costs, nonmedical costs, such as transportation, childcare, and productivity losses for patients and their caregivers, will be important. Additionally, evaluation of economic burden by cancer site, stage at diagnosis, duration of survivorship, and treatment(s) will increase understanding of the overall impact of mental health conditions on cancer survivors and on the healthcare system.","Khushalani, Jaya S; Qin, Jin; Cyrus, John; Buchanan Lunsford, Natasha; Rim, Sun Hee; Han, Xuesong; Yabroff, K Robin; Ekwueme, Donatus U",Expert review of pharmacoeconomics & outcomes research,486,16

Recently in vitro data have suggested vitamin D may play a role in stabilizing CCM2 endothelial cells. Little is known about the effect of vitamin D in human CM disease. METHODS Beginning in 2015, consecutive patients at our institution with radiologically confirmed CM were recruited to participate in a prospective clinical registry as well as 25-hydroxy-vitamin D study. A structured interview, survey, and examination were performed at baseline. Medical records and magnetic resonance imaging studies were reviewed and data collected included comorbid conditions, medication use, and location of CM. Standard definition of clinical hemorrhage, FND, and seizures was used. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used, and OR, 95% CIs, and likelihood-ratio p values were calculated to determine the influence of the 25-hydroxy-vitamin D level on clinical presentation with hemorrhage. RESULTS Of 213 patients enrolled in the clinical registry between January 2015 and October 2018, 70 participated in the vitamin D study (median age: 38.3 years; 51.4% female). Of the 70 participants, 30 (42.9%) presented with hemorrhage. 25-Hydroxy-vitamin D levels were performed within 1 year of symptoms in 64.1% of patients. Patients presenting with hemorrhage had a lower 25-hydroxy-vitamin D level compared to those presenting with seizure without hemorrhage, FND, or as an incidental finding (median 25.5 ng/mL; range 11-59 hemorrhage vs. median 31.0; range 14-60, no hemorrhage; p = 0.04). After adjusting for age, month of blood draw, and body mass index, 25-hydroxy-vitamin D remained a significant predictor of hemorrhagic presentation. Brainstem location also predicted hemorrhage at presentation. CONCLUSION Low 25-hydroxy-vitamin D level was more common in patients with CM presenting with hemorrhage. This study supports the potential role of modifiable factor in the initial clinical presentation of CM. Further study is needed to determine the role of vitamin D on prospective hemorrhage risk and whether supplementation may be beneficial.","Flemming, Kelly D; Kumar, Shivram; Brown, Robert D; Singh, Ravinder J; Whitehead, Kevin; McCreath, Lauren; Lanzino, Giuseppe",Cerebrovascular diseases,486,19

Off-clamp LPN with zero ischemia can completely eliminate ischemic reperfusion injury to the kidney. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and functional outcome of nephrometry score-guided off-clamp technique in LPN. METHODS A total of 44 patients underwent LPN between January 2015 and July 2015 for renal mass with radius, exophytic/endophytic, nearness to sinus, anterior/posterior location (RENAL) score 4 were enrolled. Twenty-two of them underwent off-clamp LPN with zero ischemia, and the other 22 received standard LPN with common renal artery clamp. Estimate blood loss (EBL), total operation time, resection time, renorrhaphy time, preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), postoperative eGFR, eGFR change, and drainage after surgery were compared between these two groups using t test. RESULTS Patients' characteristics including gender, age, BMI, tumor size, and RENAL score were balanced between the two groups. Average EBL was more in the off-clamp group than in the on-clamp group (134.32 versus 70.23 ml, p = 0.001). Average eGFR change was less in the off-clamp group than in the on-clamp group (-1.56 versus -6.45, p < 0.001). Average drainage after surgery was 203.41 ml for the off-clamp group and 145.46 ml for the on-clamp group, p = 0.062. No urinary leakage and hematuria occurred in both groups. There were no statistical difference in total operation time, resection time, renorrhaphy time, preoperative eGFR, and postoperative eGFR between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS Off-clamp LPN is a safe and feasible approach to excise certain kidney tumors with RENAL score 4. This technique can better preserve kidney function without ischemic reperfusion injury.","Wang, Hong-Kai; Qin, Xiao-Jian; Ma, Chun-Guang; Shi, Guo-Hai; Zhang, Hai-Liang; Ye, Ding-Wei",World journal of surgical oncology,486,12

The impact of these two procedures on health-related quality of life has not been analyzed in comparative studies. METHODS A matched-pair analysis of a prospectively collected database was performed. Fifty-two consecutive patients with laparoscopic gastric bypass were randomly matched to fifty-two patients with laparoscopic gastric banding according to age, BMI, and gender. Quality of life was assessed using two standardized questionnaires (SF 36 and Moorehead-Ardelt II). RESULTS Mean preoperative BMI was 45.7 kg/m(2) for the bypass patients and 45.3 kg/m(2) for the banding patients. Mean BMI after 3 years follow-up of was 30.4 kg/m(2) and 33.1 kg/m(2) (p=0.036). In the SF 36 questionnaire, gastric bypass patients yielded a mean total score of 613 versus 607 points in the gastric banding group (p=0.543), which is comparable to the normal population in Europe. In the Moorhead-Ardelt II questionnaire, the gastric bypass patients scored a mean total of 1.35 points and the gastric banding patients 1.28 points (p=0.747). Of the patients, 97% with a gastric bypass and 83% with a gastric banding were satisfied with the result of the operation (p=0.145).

The impact of the disease among the obstetric population remains unclear, and the study of the placenta can provide valuable information. Adequate sampling of the placental tissue can help characterize the pathways of viral infections. METHODS A protocol of placental sampling is proposed, aiming at guaranteeing representativity of the placenta and describing the adequate conservation of samples and their integrity for future analysis. The protocol is presented in its complete and simplified versions, allowing its implementation in different complexity settings. RESULTS Sampling with the minimum possible interval from childbirth is the key for adequate sampling and storage. This protocol has already been implemented during the Zika virus outbreak. CONCLUSION A protocol for adequate sampling and storage of placental tissue is fundamental for adequate evaluation of viral infections on the placenta. During the COVID-19 pandemic, implementation of this protocol may help to elucidate critical aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Nobrega, Guilherme de Moraes; Guida, José Paulo Siqueira; Japecanga, Rodolfo Rosa; Antolini-Tavares, Arthur; Mysorekar, Indira; Costa, Maria Laura",Revista brasileira de ginecologia e obstetricia : revista da Federacao Brasileira das Sociedades de Ginecologia e Obstetricia,486,12

The results demonstrated that the crystallinity and morphology of the Cs3Cu2I5 films can be improved and the resistive switching performance can be modulated by adding an appropriate amount of HI. The obtained Cs3Cu2I5 films by adding 5 μL HI exhibit the fewest lattice defects and flattest surface (RMS = 13.3 nm). Besides, the memory device, utilizing the optimized films, has a low electroforming voltage (1.44 V), a large on/off ratio (∼65), and a long retention time (104 s).

Recent data support the role of interferons (IFN), especially type I IFN (IFN-I), in the onset and development of APS clinical manifestations, including thrombotic events and obstetric complications. AREAS COVERED In this review the authors aimed to discuss the growing body of evidences on the relevance of IFN-I pathways in APS, both from a basic mechanistic perspective, focusing on its possible use in disease/patients stratification. The IFN-I signature has shown promising, although preliminary, results in segregating aPL-positive subjects by aPL profile, association with other autoimmune conditions such as lupus, age at onset, and current treatment, among others. EXPERT OPINION To date, the scarce available data as well as methodological and technical heterogeneity among studies limit the comparability of the results, thus requiring further validation to translate these findings to routine clinical practice. Therefore, further research is required in pursuit of more nuanced patient profiling and the development of new immunomodulatory therapeutic strategies for APS beyond anti-coagulant and anti-platelet agents.","Cecchi, Irene; Radin, Massimo; Rodríguez-Carrio, Javier; Tambralli, Ajay; Knight, Jason S; Sciascia, Savino",Expert review of clinical immunology,486,1

As minimally invasive surgery has developed, minimising surgical trauma and improving cosmetic outcomes have led to the development of single-port laparoscopic surgery (SPLS). The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility and safety of SPLS for acute appendicitis during pregnancy. Patients and Methods Between September 2014 and May 2016, 12 pregnant patients diagnosed with acute appendicitis and having single-port laparoscopic appendectomy were included in the study. Results The median gestational age at surgery was 16 weeks (6-30 weeks). All operations were completed safely and without vascular or visceral injury. Four patients (33.3%) required conversion to a reduced-port laparoscopic surgery with 3 patients (25%) having a 5 mm port inserted because of perforated appendicitis with drain placement, and 1 patient (8.3%) having a 2-mm needle instrument insertion. Median operation time was 60 min (32-100 min), and a drainage tube was placed in 5 patients (41.7%). Median total length of incision was 2 cm (1.2-2.5 cm). The median time to soft diet initiation and length of stay in the hospital were 1 day (0-9 days) and 5 days (2-11 days), respectively. Two patients (8.0%) developed post-operative complications: One wound site bleeding and two surgical site infections. One case of abortion (8.3%) was noted on the post-operative day 1 and one case of imperforate hymen was noted after delivery. Conclusions SPLS appendectomy is feasible and safe for treating patients with acute appendicitis during pregnancy.","Cho, In Soo; Bae, Sung Uk; Jeong, Woon Kyung; Baek, Seong Kyu",Journal of minimal access surgery,486,24

Given the scale of this burden and lockdown measures in most countries, there is a need for an integrated rehabilitation pathway using a tele-medicine approach to screen and manage these sequelae in a systematic and efficient way. METHODS A multidisciplinary team of professionals in the UK developed a comprehensive pragmatic telephone screening tool, the COVID-19 Yorkshire Rehabilitation Screen (C19-YRS), and an integrated rehabilitation pathway, which spans the acute hospital trust, community trust and primary care service within the National Health Service (NHS) service model. RESULTS The C19-YRS telephone screening tool, developed previously, was used to screen symptoms and grade their severity. Referral criteria thresholds were applied to the output of C19-YRS to inform the decision-making process in the rehabilitation pathway. A dedicated multidisciplinary COVID-19 rehabilitation team is the core troubleshooting forum for managing complex cases with needs spanning multiple domains of the health condition. CONCLUSION The authors recommend that health services dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic adopt a comprehensive telephone screening system and an integrated rehabilitation pathway to manage the large number of survivors in a timely and effective manner and to enable the provision of targeted interventions.","Sivan, Manoj; Halpin, Stephen; Hollingworth, Lisa; Snook, Nicola; Hickman, Katherine; Clifton, Ian J",Journal of rehabilitation medicine,486,30

A descriptive epidemiological study was conducted using data on the number of deaths by suicide published by the National Police Agency. The suicide rate ratio during the crisis-the monthly suicide mortality rate in the year of the crisis divided by the average suicide mortality rate in the three years before the crisis-was used as the indicator. After the earthquake, in March 2011 the suicide rate was 18% lower than the average mortality rate for the previous three years. However, it increased by 18% in May and 8% in June; increased mortality was observed among women. The suicide rate began to decline after October 2011. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the suicide rate decreased from February to June 2020. The declines in April and May were significant at 20% and 18%, respectively. From July onwards, the suicide rate of women began to rise, and from October, the overall suicide also began to increase. The rise in female suicide rates was significant, especially in October, with an increase of 70%. Thus, during these crises, suicide rates fell temporarily but then rose, especially among women. The period of increase in suicide rates was longer during the COVID-19 pandemic than after the earthquake. Therefore, there is an urgent need to promote measures for suicide prevention currently, and during a future crisis.","Osaki, Yoneatsu; Otsuki, Hitoshi; Imamoto, Aya; Kinjo, Aya; Fujii, Maya; Kuwabara, Yuki; Kondo, Yoko; Suyama, Yoshiko",Journal of psychiatric research,486,1

The authors hypothesized that a shallow angle of approach may reduce the rate of posterior wall injuries compared with the conventional steep angle approach. The present study aimed to evaluate whether a difference in the angle of approach of the needle affects the rate of posterior wall injuries. The present study was a randomized crossover-controlled trial involving 40 medical residents, conducted in the clinical training center at a hospital with a residency program. The primary outcome measure was the rate of posterior vessel wall injuries. Subjects received a didactic lecture during which the instructors taught three SAX-OOP techniques including the conventional free-hand method (procedure C), a needle navigation system (procedure N), and a shallow puncture angle using a guidance system (procedure S). Participants were trained in these approaches under supervision and each technique tested in a simulation environment. Thirty-four of 40 residents had no previous experience with central venous catheterization and were included in the final analysis. The rate of posterior vessel wall injuries in procedure S (9%) was significantly lower than using the other approaches (procedure C, 53%; procedure N, 41%). In conclusion, a shallow angle of approach using the SAX-OOP technique resulted in significantly fewer posterior vein wall injuries in central venous catheterization compared with steep angle techniques.","Watanabe, Kunitaro; Tokumine, Joho; Lefor, Alan Kawarai; Motoyasu, Akira; Moriyama, Kumi; Yorozu, Tomoko",BioMed research international,486,1

OBJECTIVE To conduct a rapid validation study assessing our ability to reliably provide diagnostic Neuropathology services via a whole slide imaging (WSI) platform as part of our departmental COVID-19 planning response. DESIGN This retrospective study assessed diagnostic concordance of neuropathological diagnoses rendered via WSI as compared to those originally established via traditional histopathology in a cohort of 30 cases encompassing a broad range of neurosurgical and neuromuscular entities. This study included the digitalization of 93 slide preparations, which were independently examined by groups of board-certified neuropathologists and neuropathology fellows. RESULTS There were no major or minor diagnostic discrepancies identified in either the attending neuropathologist or neuropathology trainee groups for either the neurosurgical or neuromuscular case cohorts.

METHODS Referring to other related guidelines, general considerations specific to the diagnosis and treatment of highly prevalent anorectal diseases were developed to target the correct patients, evaluate and orientate by telemedicine, adapt the Proctology Unit to the new pandemic, and control contamination and infection. Specific considerations for common anorectal diseases were cited, and our initial results were retrospectively documented. RESULTS From March 1 to April 10, 2020, we contacted 240 patients with anorectal diseases in two centers. We evaluated the results retrospectively on 16-17 April. At the end of this survey, 14 patients (5.8%) were lost for further contact and follow-up. Thirty-one patients (12.9%) were evaluated as nondeferrable cases and invited to the Proctology Unit. Twenty-eight patients required interventions at the same session. Adhering to the principles described here, more than 90 percent of benign anorectal disorders could be treated successfully, with 2.1 percent of suspected contamination and no confirmed cases.

However, the dysregulation of RNA m6A regulators (writers, readers, and erasers) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) has never been reported. In this study, we showed that METTL3, one of the writers, was upregulated in NPC. Functional studies revealed that METTL3 promoted the migration and invasion of NPC cells. However, METTL3 knockdown reversed this effect and inhibited the migration, invasion and metastasis of NPC cells. METTL3 activated the luciferase activity of TOPflash (a reporter for beta-catenin/TCF signaling), and downregulation of METTL3 inhibited the expression of beta-catenin/TCF target genes vimentin and N-cadherin, which are two regulators of epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Moreover, dominant negative beta-catenin blocked the migration and invasion of NPC cells. Further mechanistic studies showed that METTL3 silencing decreased the m6A methylation and total mRNA levels of Tankyrase, a negative regulator of axin. Moreover, Tankyrase overexpression abrogated the repressive effects of METTL3 silencing on the migration of NPC cells. Collectively, our study demonstrates the oncogenic roles of METTL3 in NPC, and suggests that METTL3 might be a therapeutic target for NPC.","Liu, Zhi-Feng; Yang, Jing; Wei, Shu-Pei; Luo, Xing-Gu; Jiang, Qing-Shan; Chen, Tao; Gong, Yong-Qian",The Kaohsiung journal of medical sciences,486,1

RESULTS Ninety-one parallel charts were collected from 25 epileptologists, who had a mean age of 50 years; their narratives concerned patients with a mean age of 37 years, with different types of epilepsy (53 % drug-resistant; 31 % unemployed). The limitations in the daily life of people with epilepsy (57 %), employment (42 %), caregiver burden (51 %), and the universal prevalence of fear were the primary topics that emerged. Attentive and reassuring care relationships were found to be the main element of coping (21 %). A new multi-factorial classification of epilepsies, integrating clinical with social and legal risk factors, was the main agreed action to face the issues identified. CONCLUSIONS The narrative medicine approach supplied a broader scenario of living with epilepsy, including the family and social impact and possible effects on the choices for care pathways. The epileptologists showed a strong motivation to care for patients with epilepsy and deep involvement in the care relationships; the use of parallel chart demonstrated to be an effective tool to preserve their wellbeing.","Chesi, P; Marini, M G; Scarlata, P; Mecarelli, O",Seizure,486,19

Serological tests to identify antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are an important tool to characterize subclinical infection exposure, which is critical in determining transmission trajectories and consequent population immunity. During the summer of 2020, a mail-based serological survey with self-collected dried blood spot (DBS) samples was implemented among university affiliates and their household members in Massachusetts, USA. Described here are some of the challenges faced and novel procedures used during the implementation of this study to assess the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies amid the global pandemic. Important challenges included remote and contact-minimized participant recruitment, limited availability of commodities and laboratory capacity, a potentially biased sample population, and policy changes impacting the distribution of clinical results to study participants. Methods used to surmount these challenges and lessons learned are presented to inform similar studies. Key lessons relate to the acceptability and feasibility of DBS sampling, supply requirements, the logistics of packing and shipping packages, data linkages to enrolled household members, and the utility of having an on-call nurse available for participant concerns during sample collection. Future studies might consider additional recruitment techniques such as conducting studies during academic semesters when recruiting in a university setting, partnerships with supply and shipping specialists, and using a stratified sampling approach to minimize potential biases in recruitment. This study design highlights the feasibility and acceptability of self-collected bio-samples and has broad applicability for other serological surveys for a range of pathogens.","Cramer, E.

The study presented in this paper involved identifying and proposing the managerial competencies needed for a successful I4.0 environment. I4.0 is a complex phenomenon that spans multiple technologies and requires an extensive set of capabilities that managers and organizations need to develop in their functional and business contexts. Using the published literature on I4.0, we uncovered the key themes following a qualitative coding method that identified the managerial competencies most relevant to I4.0. We thus identify a set of 14 managerial competencies as crucial to I4.0. We further contribute to the literature by making an assessment of the significance of all these competencies and proposing a competency model with behavioral descriptors for each. We expect the findings in this paper to benefit business organizations, policy makers, academics, and other stakeholders engaged in developing the capabilities required for an I4.0 ecosystem.","Shet, Sateesh V.; Pereira, Vijay",Technological Forecasting and Social Change,486,24

Methods The mice at different developmental stages were enrolled, including fetal mice (embryonic days 14.5 and 18.5), neonatal mice (0, 3, 7, 14, and 21 days old), young mice (28 and 42 days old), and adult mice (84 days old). The lung tissues of all fetal mice from 4 pregnant mice were collected at each time point in the fetal group. Four mice were sampled in other age groups at each time point. Whole transcriptome resequencing was used to measure the mRNA expression of AGT, ACE, ACE2, Renin, Agtr1a, Agtr1b, Agtr2, and Mas1 in mouse lung tissue. Results The expression of ACE2 in the lungs showed changes from embryonic stage to adult stage. It increased gradually after birth, reached a peak on day 3 after birth, and reached a nadir on day 14 after birth (P<0.05). The expression of AGT reached a peak on days 0 and 7 after birth and reached a nadir on day 21 after birth (P<0.05). The expression of ACE increased rapidly after birth and reached a peak on day 21 after birth (P<0.05). Agtr1a expression reached a peak on day 21 after birth (P<0.05). Agtr2 expression gradually decreased to a low level after birth. Renin, Agtr1b, and Mas1 showed low expression in lung tissues at all developmental stages. Conclusions At different developmental stages of mice, ACE2 has dynamic expression changes, with high expression in early neonatal and adult mice. The other key molecules of the RAS pathway have their own expression patterns. These suggest that the difference in clinical features between children and adults with COVID-19 might be associated with the different expression levels of ACE2 in the different stages, and further studies are needed for the mechanism.","Lou, Li Li Xie Liang Hu Yu Na Chenl L.; Liang, Ping Shi Fang Liu Cai Jun Liu Han Min",Chinese Journal of Contemporary Pediatrics,486,16

The diagnosis was based on lack of platelet aggregation with adenosine diphosphate (ADP), arachidonic acid and collagen, and normal aggregation induced by ristocetin. OBJECTIVE To study the mechanism of platelet function inhibition in a patient with acquired thrombasthenia. METHODS Aggregation assays of platelets from the patient and healthy controls were performed. In addition, anti-glycoprotein (GP) IIbIIIa antibodies bindingto normal in the presence or absence of the patient's serum was by flow cytometry. RESULTS Aggregation of normal platelets in the presence of patient's plasma was inhibited four- and 2.5-fold in the presence of ADP and arachidonic acid respectively, while collagen-induced aggregation was completely abolished. Ristocetin-induced aggregation was normal. The patient's serum inhibited binding of commercial anti-glycoprotein IIbIIIa antibodies to normal platelets twofold by flow cytometry. Treatment with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (rituximab) normalized the patient's platelet aggregation. CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that the patient developed inhibitory anti-GPIIbIIIa autoantibodies that caused acquired thrombasthenia.","Blickstein, Dorit; Dardik, Rima; Rosenthal, Esther; Lahav, Judith; Molad, Yair; Inbal, Aida",The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ,486,1

Here, we report the identification and characterization of three distinct suppressors of RNA silencing encoded by the approximately 20-kb plus-strand RNA genome of citrus tristeza virus (CTV). When introduced by genetic crosses into plants carrying a silencing transgene, both p20 and p23, but not coat protein (CP), restored expression of the transgene. Although none of the CTV proteins prevented DNA methylation of the transgene, export of the silencing signal (capable of mediating intercellular silencing spread) was detected only from the F(1) plants expressing p23 and not from the CP- or p20-expressing F(1) plants, demonstrating suppression of intercellular silencing by CP and p20 but not by p23. Thus, intracellular and intercellular silencing are each targeted by a CTV protein, whereas the third, p20, inhibits silencing at both levels. Notably, CP suppresses intercellular silencing without interfering with intracellular silencing. The novel property of CP suggests a mechanism distinct to p20 and all of the other viral suppressors known to interfere with intercellular silencing and that this class of viral suppressors may not be consistently identified by Agrobacterium coinfiltration because it also induces RNA silencing against the infiltrated suppressor transgene. Our analyses reveal a sophisticated viral counter-defense strategy that targets the silencing antiviral pathway at multiple steps and may be essential for protecting CTV with such a large RNA genome from antiviral silencing in the perennial tree host.","Lu, Rui; Folimonov, Alexey; Shintaku, Michael; Li, Wan-Xiang; Falk, Bryce W; Dawson, William O; Ding, Shou-Wei",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,486,1

In all diverse medical departments CRP is often used, and also in orthopaedics CRP is proved to be very helpful in diagnosis and monitor of infections. CRP in most fields is superior to conventional and newer infection parameter and is a basic parameter for inflammation. Especially for detection of an early postoperative infection CRP can be very helpful as an objective parameter easy to obtain. In uneventful operative treatment a similar evolution in CRP concentrations was found: the peak level occurred on the second or third postoperative day and reflected the extent of surgical trauma. A second rise of CRP in the postoperative course indicates a complication. Highest levels are reached in bacterial infection after the forth postoperative day with a cut-off level about 10 mg/dl. CRP can also be used as a preoperative marker for risk stratification and newer times CRP is reported as an independent fracture-risk-factor. In general CRP is the basic inflammatory parameter in orthopaedic surgery and is more significant and common than WBC or ESR.

METHODS AND RESULTS A total of 3325 patients with lower respiratory infection (LRI) [bronchiolitis (42%), pneumonia (38%) and croup (12%)] were identified. It is estimated that 545,000 LRI hospitalizations occur each year in the United States in children younger than 18 years old (viral, 428,000; pneumonia, 221,000; bronchiolitis, 222,000; croup, 65,000), including a continued increase in bronchiolitis hospitalizations (47.8/1000; <1 year). The most common viruses detected each year in hospitalized children included respiratory syncytial virus (A and B; 117,000), parainfluenza virus (PIV-1 and -2, 48 000; PIV-3, 18,000) and influenza (A and B, 39,000). With multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (MPCR), different patient populations demonstrated different LRI epidemiology in relation to specific syndromes and viral causes. At least 21% of LRI hospitalizations were in children with significant medical problems.PIVs were detected much more frequently in immunocompromised children than in previously healthy children (33% vs. 16%). Similarly 15% of respiratory syncytial virus was detected between May and October, mostly in immunocompromised children. Influenza caused 19% of bronchiolitis in previously healthy children, and no virus could be reliably predicted based on clinical presentation, including wheezing. Of children hospitalized for LRI, 40% tested positive for the seven most common respiratory viruses by MPCR. CONCLUSIONS Work is under way to expand the number of viruses detected by MPCR and to determine whether newly discovered viruses, such as human metapneumovirus, contribute to the burden of pediatric LRI hospitalizations.","Henrickson, Kelly J; Hoover, Susan; Kehl, K Sue; Hua, Weimin",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,486,10

Due to privacy reasons, most of the users will not disclose their location. Detecting the location of the tweet users is required to track the geographic location of the spreading diseases. This work aims to detect the spreading location of the COVID-19 disease from the Twitter users and content discussed in the tweet. COVID-19 is a disease caused by the ""novel coronavirus."" About 80% of confirmed cases recover from the disease. However, one out of every six people who get COVID-19 can become seriously ill, stated by the World health organization. Inferring the user location for identifying the spreading location for the disease is a very challenging task. This paper proposes a new technique based on a hypergraph model to detect the Twitter user's locations based on the spreading disease. This model uses hypergraph with weighting factor technique to infer the spreading disease's spatial location. The accuracy of prediction can be improved when a massive volume of streaming data is analyzed. The Helly property of the hypergraph was applied to discard less potential words from the text analysis, which claims this work of unique nature. A weighting factor was introduced to calculate the score of each location for a particular user. The location of each user is predicted based on the one that possesses the highest weighting factor. The proposed framework has been evaluated and tested for various measures like precision, recall and F-measure.

Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy structure of a translating mammalian ribosome primed for frameshifting on the viral RNA. The viral RNA adopts a pseudoknot structure that lodges at the entry to the ribosomal mRNA channel to generate tension in the mRNA and promote frameshifting, whereas the nascent viral polyprotein forms distinct interactions with the ribosomal tunnel. Biochemical experiments validate the structural observations and reveal mechanistic and regulatory features that influence frameshifting efficiency. Finally, we compare compounds previously shown to reduce frameshifting with respect to their ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication, establishing coronavirus frameshifting as a target for antiviral intervention.","Bhatt, Pramod R; Scaiola, Alain; Loughran, Gary; Leibundgut, Marc; Kratzel, Annika; Meurs, Romane; Dreos, René; O039,; Connor, Kate M; McMillan, Angus; Bode, Jeffrey W; Thiel, Volker; Gatfield, David; Atkins, John F; Ban, Nenad",Science (Wash.),486,7

The analysis focuses on trends and changes in the two most important forms of trade in banking services, namely, cross-border banking flows, which include direct cross-border banking flows and local banking flows of international banks' subsidiaries abroad, and foreign bank presence. It has been concluded that direct cross-border banking flows are more volatile than local banking flows of foreign banks during economic and social upheavals. The period under study has witnessed large increase in foreign bank presence, both in terms of number and local market share. The study determines changes of leading international banks and their home countries, highlighting the weakening position of banks from advanced countries and increase in the role of banks from emerging markets and developing countries. The authors review international expansion strategies of major banks from the post-Soviet states, that are influenced both by the opportunities and goals of banks going abroad, and by the institutional features of their banking systems;countries which these banks are targeting are predominantly comparable to the post-Soviet states in terms of economic development, and are chosen by criteria of their attractiveness, such as high level of trade and political relations with the bank's home country, the presence of diaspora, the degree of saturation and growth dynamics of the banking market in the host country. The reasons behind the banks' geographical expansion decision include, among many others, the dramatic growth of their economies, stimulated by the involvement in globalization processes, and liberal banking reforms. Obstacles of economic and non-economic nature that are hindering this expansion, encompass high level of competition in external banking markets, expensive financial resources of domestic banks, low level of expansion of the post-Soviet states-based enterprises to the non-post-Soviet states, discriminatory qualification requirements for personnel and composition of management bodies, problems related to banking licensing procedures and requirements, aspects of culture and communication;their transformation from local banks, operating in the local market, to banks with a clear manifestation of the tendency of their international expansion amidst changing global environment and uncertainty. © Institute of Society Transformation, 2020","Murshudli, F.; Zapotichna, R.; Dilbazi, E.",Economic Annals-XXI,486,20

It is an important consequence of the aging adult population, generating a plethora of spine-related interventions with variable treatment efficacy and consistently high costs. Recent years have witnessed more than a threefold increase in the prevalence and treatment of ASD, and further increases over the coming decades are expected with the growing elderly population worldwide. The ability to monitor and assess clinical outcomes has not kept pace with these developments. This paper addresses the pressing need to provide a set of common outcome metrics for this growing group of patients with back pain and other disabilities due to an adult spinal deformity. METHODS: The standard outcome set was created by a panel with global representation, using a thorough modified Delphi procedure. The three-tiered outcome hierarchy (Porter) was used as a framework to capture full cycle of care. The standardized language of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (WHO-ICF) was used. RESULTS: Consensus was reached on a core set of 25 WHO-ICF outcome domains ('What to measure'); on the accompanying globally available clinician and patient reported measurement instruments and definitions ('How to measure'), and on the timing of the measurements ('When to measure'). The current work has brought to light domains not routinely reported in the spinal literature (such as pulmonary function, return to work, social participation), and domains for which no adequate instruments have yet been identified (such as how to clinically quantify in routine practice lumbar spinal stenosis, neurogenic claudication, radicular pain, and loss of lower extremity motor function). CONCLUSION: A standard outcome set was developed for patients undergoing treatment for adult spinal deformity using globally available outcome metrics. The current framework can be considered a reference for further work, and may provide a starting point for routine methodical and systematic monitoring of outcomes. Post-COVID e-health may accelerate the routine capture of these types of data.","de Kleuver, Marinus; Faraj, Sayf S A; Haanstra, Tsjitske M; Wright, Anna K; Polly, David W; van Hooff, Miranda L; Glassman, Steven D",Spine Deform,486,1

However, it is pertinent to identify the hardships associated with pet ownership. We conducted a large-scale survey of U.S. pet owners (n = 2254) in spring and summer 2020 to assess the ways that relationships with pets impacted life during COVID-19. We used thematic analysis to analyze 3671 open-ended responses to three prompts. Reported concerns fell into three major categories: (1) pet-focused (meeting needs of pets; procuring supplies; accessing veterinary care; new and emerging behavioral issues; fate of the pet if owner becomes ill; general safety and well-being), (2) human-focused (issues with working from home; well-being and mental health; balancing responsibilities), and (3) household-focused (disease spread; economic issues). Quantitative analyses showed that the owner's strength of attachment to their pet, economic resources, and relationship status were associated with the types of concerns expressed. Results from this study indicate that pet owners experienced unique hardships related to changes in everyday life from the COVID-19 pandemic. These hardships should be considered alongside the potential benefits found in other studies in order to manage pet owner expectations, prevent pet relinquishment, and more fully understand multifaceted human-companion animal relationships.","Applebaum, Jennifer W; Tomlinson, Camie A; Matijczak, Angela; McDonald, Shelby E; Zsembik, Barbara A",,486,20

Outcomes following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in individuals with primary immunodeficiency (PID) or symptomatic secondary immunodeficiency (SID) remain uncertain. OBJECTIVES: We sought to document the outcomes of individuals with PID or symptomatic SID following COVID-19 in the United Kingdom. METHODS: At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the United Kingdom Primary Immunodeficiency Network established a registry of cases to collate the nationwide outcomes of COVID-19 in individuals with PID or symptomatic SID and determine risk factors associated with morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 in these patient groups. RESULTS: A total of 100 patients had been enrolled by July 1, 2020, 60 with PID, 7 with other inborn errors of immunity including autoinflammatory diseases and C1 inhibitor deficiency, and 33 with symptomatic SID. In individuals with PID, 53.3% (32 of 60) were hospitalized, the infection-fatality ratio was 20.0% (12 of 60), the case-fatality ratio was 31.6% (12 of 38), and the inpatient mortality was 37.5% (12 of 32). Individuals with SID had worse outcomes than those with PID; 75.8% (25 of 33) were hospitalized, the infection-fatality ratio was 33.3% (11 of 33), the case-fatality ratio was 39.2% (11 of 28), and inpatient mortality was 44.0% (11 of 25). CONCLUSIONS: In comparison to the general population, adult patients with PID and symptomatic SID display greater morbidity and mortality from COVID-19.

Prior to the pandemic, the Virginia Fresh Match (VFM) Nutrition Incentive Network partnered with food retail outlets to provide Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participants point-of-purchase incentives (e.g., Double Up Food Bucks, SNAP Match), which function as matching discounts on fresh fruits and vegetables (F/V). These can enable participants to increase their purchasing power and potentially reduce food insecurity. In response to COVID-19, VFM removed the limit on incentive discounts (previously $101) to further incentivize the purchase of fresh F/V by SNAP participants. This study sought to characterize the purchasing patterns of SNAP participants at a food co-operative (co-op) partnered with VFM before and during the Virginia stay-at-home order. A total of 654 transactions at the co-op were included. Independent t-tests were utilized to determine differences before and during the order. The results indicated a significant increase in the mean incentive discount received during the order (pre-shutdown=$3.95, inter-shutdown=$5.01, p=0.035);however, simultaneously there was a decrease in the mean number of fresh F/V purchased (pre-shutdown=3.08, inter-shutdown=2.39, p=0.015). Although F/V purchases decreased, the presence of unlimited point-of-purchase incentives at the food co-op may have helped prevent a greater decline in fresh F/V purchases and helped increase access to fresh F/V in this population during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Parker, M.

Compliance is essential for SCIT to obtain maximal benefit as it is a long-term treatment. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the level of real-life SCIT compliance in pediatric patients and the associated factors. Additional aims were to determine how SCIT compliance was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and why some patients dropped out SCIT. METHOD: Pediatric patients diagnosed with allergic rhinitis, allergic asthma, or venom allergy that received SCIT between September 2012 and July 2020 were analyzed. RESULTS: The study included 201 children (66.7% male) with a median (interquartile range) age of 12.8 years (9.4-15.2) at the time of the first SCIT injection. The overall compliance rate before COVID-19 pandemic was 86.1%. Short SCIT follow-up time and venom anaphylaxis were found to be risk factors for drop out. The leading causes of drop outs were moving to another city/country (32.1%), symptom improvement (17.8%), treatment ineffectiveness (14.2%), and adverse reactions (14.2%). Among the 108 patients that were still receiving SCIT during the COVID-19 pandemic, 31 (28.7%) dropped out the therapy. The most frequent reasons for drop-out were fear of being infected with COVID-19 (35.4%) and thinking that the AIT practise stopped due to COVID-19 pandemic (29%). Male gender and older age were found to be the independent risk factors for drop-out of SCIT. CONCLUSIONS: Real life compliance in children was found 13.9% and it was higher than adults. Nearly one-third of children dropped out during the CO-VID-19 pandemic. Male gender and older age are associated with SCIT drop-out during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Aytekin, Elif Soyak; Soyer, Özge; Sekerel, Bülent E; Sahiner, Ümit M",Int Arch Allergy Immunol,486,5

Data from patients with severe clinical manifestations compared to patients with mild symptoms indicate that highly dysregulated exuberant inflammatory responses correlate with severity of disease and lethality. Significantly elevated cytokine levels, i.e. cytokine storm, seem to play a central role in severity and lethality in COVID-19. We have previously shown that excessive cytokine release induced by highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza A virus was reduced by application of proteasome inhibitors. In the present study we present experimental data of a central cellular pro-inflammatory signal pathways, NF-kappaB, in the context of published clinical data from COVID-19 patients and develop a hypothesis for a therapeutic approach aiming at the simultaneous inhibition of whole cascades of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines via blocking the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB by proteasome inhibitors. The simultaneous inhibition of multiple cytokines/chemokines using clinically approved proteasome inhibitors is expected to have a higher therapeutic potential compared to single target approaches to prevent cascade (i.e. triggering, synergistic, and redundant) effects of multiple induced cytokines and may provide an additional therapeutic option to be explored for treatment of critical stage COVID-19 patients.","Kircheis, Ralf; Haasbach, Emanuel; Lueftenegger, Daniel; Heyken, Willm T.; Ocker, Matthias; GmbH, Oliver Planz Virologik; Erlangen, 91052; Biology, Germany Institute of cell; Immunology,; Tuebingen, Eberhard Karls University; Germany,; Research, Institute for Surgical; Marburg, Philipps University of; Marburg, 35043",,486,15

Our study aimed to evaluate the relationship between COVID-19 and serum erythropoietin (EPO), hepcidin, and haptoglobin (Hpt) levels with disease severity, and other biochemical values. METHODS: Fifty nine COVID-19 patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU) and wards in our hospital between March and June 2020 and 19 healthy volunteers were included in the study. Participants were divided into mild, severe, and critical disease severity groups. Group mean values were analyzed with SPSS according to disease severity, mortality, and intubation status. RESULTS: Hemoglobin (Hb) levels were significantly lower in the critical patient group (P < .0001) and deceased group (P < .0001). The red blood cell distribution width-coefficient of variation (RDW-CV) and ferritin values were significantly higher in the intubated (P = .001, P = .005) and deceased (P = .014, P = .003) groups. Ferritin values were positively correlated with disease severity (P < .0001). Serum iron levels were lower in the patient group compared with the reference range. (P < .0001). It was found that the transferrin saturation (TfSat) was lower in the patient group compared with the control group (P < .0001). It was found that the mean EPO of the deceased was lower than the control group and the survived patient group (P = .035). Hepcidin levels were found to be significantly lower in the patient group (P < .0001). Hpt values were found to be significantly lower in the intubated group (P = .004) and the deceased group (P = .042). CONCLUSION: In our study, while serum iron and hepcidin levels decreased in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, we found that EPO and Hpt levels were significantly lower in critical and deceased patient groups. Our study is the first study examining EPO and Hpt levels in patients diagnosed with COVID-19.","Yagci, Sema; Serin, Erdinç; Acicbe, Özlem; Zeren, Mustafa Ismet; Odabasi, Merve Sena",Int. j. lab. hematol,486,3

SARS-CoV-2 main protease plays a dynamic role in mediating viral replication and transcription, which is one of the most probable drug targets against SARS-CoV-2. Ficus carica latex encompasses notable bioactive molecules with various biological properties, including antiviral activities. In this study, latex compounds of Ficus carica were screened to find out active phytochemicals against SARS-CoV-2 main protease through molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation, and ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) profiling. A total of 21 compounds were screened, and the compounds, lupeol, α-amyrin, and luteolin, showed the highest binding affinity and intense interaction with the vital catalytic residue His 41 and Cys 145. The molecular dynamics simulation revealed that the amyrin is the most stable compound with higher binding free energy, suggesting that this compound can compete with the native ligands of the main protease. The ADMET analysis indicated that these phytochemicals have considerable physicochemical, pharmacokinetics, and drug-likeness properties and do not possess any considerable detrimental effects and can be considered as potential drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2. However, further in-vitro, in-vivo, and clinical trials are required to observe the exact efficiency of these compounds. © 2020, Bangladesh Society for Microbiology, Immunology and Advanced Biotechnology.

This paper aims to learn from peer health mentors (PHM) about changes to their work during overlapping health emergencies, as well as barriers and opportunities to support people leaving prison in this context. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: The Unlocking the Gates (UTG) Peer Health Mentoring Program supports people leaving prison in British Columbia during the first three days after release. The authors conducted two focus groups with PHM over video conference in May 2020. Focus groups were recorded and transcribed, and themes were iteratively developed using narrative thematic analysis. FINDINGS: The findings highlighted the importance of peer health mentorship for people leaving prisons. PHM discussed increased opportunities for collaboration, ways the pandemic has changed how they are able to provide support, and how PHM are able to remain responsive and flexible to meet client needs. Additionally, PHM illuminated ways that COVID-19 has exacerbated existing barriers and identified specific actions needed to support client health, including increased housing and recovery beds, and tools for social and emotional well-being. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: This study contributes to our understanding of peer health mentorship during the COVID-19 pandemic from the perspective of mentors. PHM expertise can support release planning, improved health and well-being of people leaving prison and facilitate policy-supported pandemic responses.","McLeod, Katherine E; Timler, Kelsey; Korchinski, Mo; Young, Pamela; Milkovich, Tammy; McBride, Cheri; Young, Glenn; Wardell, William; Condello, Lara-Lisa; Buxton, Jane A; Janssen, Patricia A; Martin, Ruth Elwood",International journal of prisoner health (Online),486,1

OBJECTIVE: NFATc2 has been described to associate with IRF4 to induce interleukin-4, and to be inhibited by T-bet. Here, we analyzed the role of NFATc2 in asthmatic children and adults. METHODS: PBMCs were isolated from the blood of control of asthmatics subjects. Some PBMCs were analyzed untreated and some cultured with and without phytohemagglutinin. Then, RNA was extracted from the cells and cytokines were measured in the supernatants via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or multiplex analysis. RNA was then reverse-transcribed and NFATc1, NFATC2, IRF4, and T-bet mRNA were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. In addition, in peripheral blood cells, NFATc2 expression was analyzed, in a population of asthmatic children and adults from the Asthma BRIDGE study. RESULTS: In addition to NFATc1 and NIP45, also NFATc2 was found upregulated in PBMCs and peripheral blood cells from asthmatic children and adults with allergic asthma. Moreover, NFATc1 directly correlated with lymphocytes number whereas NFATc2 correlated with peripheral eosinophilia in asthma. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to NFATc1 and NIP45, NFATc2 was found upregulated in asthma. Moreover, NFATc1 mRNA correlated with lymphocytes both in control and asthma, and NFATC1 and NFATc2 mRNA showed a direct correlation with eosinophils in controls but not in asthma, indicating that NFATc1 is associated with lymphocytes and not eosinophils in asthma. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Targeting NFATc2 in T lymphocytes might ameliorate the allergic phenotype in asthmatic subjects.","Jakobi, Marielena; Kiefer, Alexander; Mirzakhani, Hooman; Rauh, Manfred; Zimmermann, Theodor; Xepapadaki, Paraskevi; Stanic, Barbara; Akdis, Mubeccel; Papadopoulos, Nikolaos G; Raby, Benjamin A; Weiss, Scott T; Finotto, Susetta",Immun.

Effective public policy is data-informed policy. This requires a liaison between public health scientists and public officials. OBJECTIVE: This article details the experience, challenges, and lessons learned advising public officials in a large metropolitan area from March to October 2020. METHODS: To effectively do this, an R Markdown report was created to iteratively monitor the number of COVID-19 tests performed, positive tests obtained, COVID-19 hospitalization census, intensive care unit census, the number of patients with COVID-19 on ventilators, and the number of deaths due to COVID-19. RESULTS: These reports were presented and discussed at meetings with policy makers to further comprehension. DISCUSSION: To facilitate the fullest understanding by both the general public and policy makers alike, we advocate for greater centralization of public health surveillance data, objective operational definitions of metrics, and greater interagency communication to best guide and inform policy makers. Through consistent data reporting methods, parsimonious and consistent analytic methods, a clear line of communication with policy makers, transparency, and the ability to navigate unforeseen externalities such as ""data dumps"" and reporting delays, scientists can use information to best support policy makers in times of crises.","Williams, Roy; Bursac, Zoran; Trepka, Mary Jo; Odom, Gabriel J",J Public Health Manag Pract,486,10

SATORI detected single-stranded RNA targets with maximal sensitivity of ~10 fM in <5 min, with high specificity. Furthermore, the simultaneous use of multiple different guide RNAs enhanced the sensitivity, thereby enabling the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 N-gene RNA at ~5 fM levels.

It consists mainly of crystalline and amorphous regions, and natural degradation of the crystalline part is highly dependent on the degree of processivity of the degrading enzymes (i.e., the extent of continuous hydrolysis without detachment from the substrate cellulose). Here, we report high-speed atomic force microscopic (HS-AFM) observations of the movement of four types of cellulases derived from the cellulolytic bacteria Cellulomonas fimi on various insoluble cellulose substrates. The HS-AFM images clearly demonstrated that two of them (CfCel6B and CfCel48A) slide on crystalline cellulose. The direction of processive movement of CfCel6B is from the nonreducing to the reducing end of the substrate, which is opposite that of processive cellulase Cel7A of the fungus Trichoderma reesei (TrCel7A), whose movement was first observed by this technique, while CfCel48A moves in the same direction as TrCel7A. When CfCel6B and TrCel7A were mixed on the same substrate, ""traffic accidents"" were observed, in which the two cellulases blocked each other's progress. The processivity of CfCel6B was similar to those of fungal family 7 cellulases but considerably higher than those of fungal family 6 cellulases. The results indicate that bacteria utilize family 6 cellulases as high-processivity enzymes for efficient degradation of crystalline cellulose, whereas family 7 enzymes have the same function in fungi. This is consistent with the idea of convergent evolution of processive cellulases in fungi and bacteria to achieve similar functionality using different protein foldings.","Uchiyama, Taku; Uchihashi, Takayuki; Nakamura, Akihiko; Watanabe, Hiroki; Kaneko, Satoshi; Samejima, Masahiro; Igarashi, Kiyohiko",Proc.

METHODS: In this study, we included adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 form Tongji Hospital (Wuhan, China), with or without influenza, and compared their clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Among 93 patients, 44 died and 49 were discharged. Forty-four (47.3%) were infected with influenza virus A and 2 (2.2%) with influenza virus B. Twenty-two (50.0%) of the non-survivors and 24 (49.0%) of the survivors were infected with the influenza virus. Critically ill COVID-19 patients with influenza were more prone to cardiac injury than those without influenza. For the laboratory indicators at admission, white blood cell counts, neutrophil counts, levels of tumor necrosis factor-&#945;, D-dimer value, and proportion of elevated creatinine were higher in non-survivors with influenza than in those without influenza. CONCLUSION: The results showed a high proportion of COVID-19 patients were co-infected with influenza in Tongji Hospital, with no significant difference in the proportion of co-infection between survivors and non-survivors. The critically ill COVID-19 patients with influenza exhibited more severe inflammation and organ injury, indicating that co-infection with the influenza virus may induce an earlier and more frequently occurring cytokine storm.","Ma, Simin; Lai, Xiaoquan; Chen, Zhe; Tu, Shenghao; Qin, Kai",Int. j. infect. dis,486,20

In this review, biomarkers/indicators for diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) or detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the environment are summarized and discussed. It is concluded that the detection methods targeting antibodies are not suitable for screening of early and asymptomatic cases since most patients had an antibody response at about 10 days after onset of symptoms. However, antibody detection methods can be combined with quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) to significantly improve the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis, and boost vaccine research. Fast, sensitive and accurate detection methods targeting antigens need to be developed urgently. Various specimens for diagnosis or detection are compared and analyzed. Among them, deep throat saliva and induced sputum are desired for RT-qPCR test or other early detection technologies.

Methods: a retrospective analysis of data from Cancer Diseases Hospital (CDH) database was conducted on EC patients diagnosed between 2007 and December 2018. Medical records of EC patients were manually retrieved and reviewed using medical record numbers identified from the CDH database. Demographics, clinicopathologic features and modes of treatment were extracted. A coding sheet was created a priori, and data analysed in SAS version 9.3. Results: two hundred and seventy eight (278) complete EC medical records were included in the analysis, 183 (66%) were males, mean age was 55 years (range 21-89). One hundred and fifty six (156) (56%) resided in Lusaka, the location of CDH. The age-standardized incidence for EC was 5.5 per 100,000 people (95% CI, 4.3-6.6). The commonest symptom was dysphagia (83%), 97% were diagnosed endoscopically, squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma accounted for 90% and 8.3% respectively, 65% received treatment. One hundred and twenty four (124) medical records had missing cancer staging. Of 154 medical records with complete cancer staging, 98 (35%) were diagnosed at stage 4 of which 33% were between 40 and 49 years. Conclusion: the age-standardized incidence for EC is high at CDH. Patients with EC are predominantly male, reside in Lusaka and present with late stage EC at time of diagnosis; mostly between the ages of 40-49 years.

In Europe, the virus spread slowed considerably in the late spring due to strict lockdown, but a second wave of the pandemic grew throughout the fall. In this study, we first reconstruct the time evolution of the effective reproduction numbers ${\cal R}(t)$ for each country by integrating the equations of the classic SIR model. We cluster countries based on the estimated ${\cal R}(t)$ through a suitable time series dissimilarity. The result suggests that simple dynamical mechanisms determine how countries respond to changes in COVID-19 case counts. Inspired by these results, we extend the SIR model to include a social response to explain the number $X(t)$ of new confirmed daily cases. As a first-order model, we assume that the social response is on the form $d_t{\cal R}=-\nu (X-X^*)$, where $X^*$ is a threshold for response. The response rate $\nu$ depends on whether $X^*$ is below or above this threshold, on three parameters $\nu_1,\;\nu_2,\,\nu_3,$, and on $t$. When $XX^*$, $\nu=\nu_2\exp{(-\nu_3t)}$, models the impact of interventions when incidence rate is high. The parameter $\nu_3$ represents the fatigue, i.e., the reduced effect of intervention as time passes. The proposed model reproduces typical evolving patterns of COVID-19 epidemic waves observed in many countries. Estimating the parameters $\nu_1,\,\nu_2,\,\nu_3$ and initial conditions, such as ${\cal R}_0$, for different countries helps to identify important dynamics in their social responses. One conclusion is that the leading cause of the strong second wave in Europe in the fall of 2020 was not the relaxation of interventions during the summer, but rather the general fatigue to interventions developing in the fall.","Rypdal, Kristoffer; Bianchi, Filippo Maria; Rypdal, Martin",,486,1

Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) play essential roles in viral RNA synthesis, and thus remains the target of choice for the prophylactic or curative treatment of several viral diseases, due to high sequence and structural conservation. To date, the most promising broad-spectrum class of viral RdRp inhibitors are nucleoside analogues (NAs), with over 25 approved for the treatment of several medically important viral diseases. However, Coronaviruses stand out as a particularly challenging case for NA drug design due to the presence of an exonuclease (ExoN) domain capable of excising incorporated NAs and thus providing resistance to many of these available antivirals. Here we use the available structures of the SARS-CoV RdRp and ExoN proteins, as well as Lassa virus N exonuclease to derive models of catalytically competent SARS-CoV-2 enzymes. We then map a promising NA candidate, GS-441524 (the active metabolite of Remdesivir) to the nucleoside active site of both proteins, identifying the residues important for nucleotide recognition, discrimination, and excision. Interestingly, GS-441524 addresses both enzyme active sites in a manner consistent with significant incorporation, delayed chain termination, and altered excision due to the ribose 1'-CN group, which may account for the increased antiviral effect compared to other available analogues. Additionally, we propose structural and function implications of two previously identified RdRp resistance mutations in relation to resistance against Remdesivir. This study highlights the importance of considering the balance between incorporation and excision properties of NAs between the RdRp and ExoN.","Shannon, Ashleigh; Le, Nhung Thi-Tuyet; Selisko, Barbara; Eydoux, Cecilia; Alvarez, Karine; Guillemot, Jean-Claude; Decroly, Etienne; Peersen, Olve; Ferron, Francois; Canard, Bruno",Antiviral Res,486,5

TB was considered incurable till the mid 19th century. The major landmark in the treatment was the discovery of Rifampicin which has led to shorter courses of therapy as compared to the previous regimens which also consisted of injectables. Although, treatment for TB is evolving expeditiously today but a lot needs to be done as far as drug resistant TB (DRTB) is concerned. Non-standard regimens in private sector, lack of access to drug susceptibility testing, delay in the treatment, poor follow up and default in the treatment has led to emergence DRTB. Addition of newer drugs like bedaquiline and delamanid has made oral regimen possible in DRTB as well. Encouraging results of BPaL regimen for extensively drug resistant TB (XDR-TB) may prove to be a game changer. The target of TB elimination by 2025 is onerous considering the huge population, rising DRTB patients and private sector non engagement in the programme despite implementation of second largest national programme of the world.","Gupta, Aditi; Chopra, Vishal",Indian J Tuberc,486,22

METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional survey amongst orthopaedic trainees to explore PPE practice in 19 hospitals caring for hip fracture patients in the North West of England. RESULTS: During the second wave of the pandemic, 14/19 (74%) hospitals experienced an outbreak of COVID-19 amongst staff or patients on the orthopaedic wards. An FFP3 respirator mask was used by doctors in only 6/19 (32%) hospitals when seeing patients with COVID-19 and a cough and in 5/19 (26%) hospitals when seeing asymptomatic patients with COVID-19. A COVID-19 outbreak was reported in 11/13 (85%) orthopaedic units where staff wore fluid resistant surgical masks compared to 3/6 (50%) units using an FFP3 respirator mask (RR 1.69, 95% CI 0.74-3.89) when caring for symptomatic patients with COVID-19. Similarly, a COVID-19 outbreak was reported in more orthopaedic units caring for asymptomatic patients with COVID-19 where staff wore fluid resistant surgical masks (12/14 (86%)) as compared to an FFP3 respirator mask (2/5 (40%)) (RR 2.14, 95% CI 0.72-6.4).

Objective: To assess the economic security, food security, health, and sexual behavior of women at high risk of HIV infection in rural Kenya during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: This survey study of women enrolled in a randomized trial in a rural county in Kenya combined results from phone interviews, conducted while social distancing measures were in effect between May 13 and June 29, 2020, with longitudinal, in-person surveys administered between September 1, 2019, and March 25, 2020. Enrolled participants were HIV-negative and had 2 or more sexual partners within the past month. Surveys collected information on economic conditions, food security, health status, and sexual behavior. Subgroup analyses compared outcomes by reliance on transactional sex for income and by educational attainment. Data were analyzed between May 2020 and April 2021. Main Outcomes and Measures: Self-reported income, employment hours, numbers of sexual partners and transactional sex partners, food security, and COVID-19 prevention behaviors. Results: A total of 1725 women participated, with a mean (SD) age of 29.3 (6.8) years and 1170 (68.0%) reporting sex work as an income source before the COVID-19 pandemic. During the pandemic, participants reported experiencing a 52% decline in mean (SD) weekly income, from $11.25 (13.46) to $5.38 (12.51) (difference, -$5.86; 95% CI, -$6.91 to -$4.82; P < .001). In all, 1385 participants (80.3%) reported difficulty obtaining food in the past month, and 1500 (87.0%) worried about having enough to eat at least once. Reported numbers of sexual partners declined from a mean (SD) total of 1.8 (1.2) partners before COVID-19 to 1.1 (1.0) during (difference, -0.75 partners; 95% CI, -0.84 to -0.67 partners; P < .001), and transactional sex partners declined from 1.0 (1.1) to 0.5 (0.8) (difference, -0.57 partners; 95% CI, -0.64 to -0.50 partners; P < .001). In subgroup analyses, women reliant on transactional sex for income were 18.3% (95% CI, 11.4% to 25.2%) more likely to report being sometimes or often worried that their household would have enough food than women not reliant on transactional sex (P < .001), and their reported decline in employment was 4.6 hours (95% CI, -7.9 to -1.2 hours) greater than women not reliant on transactional sex (P = .008). Conclusions and Relevance: In this survey study, COVID-19 was associated with large reductions in economic security among women at high risk of HIV infection in Kenya. However, shifts in sexual behavior may have temporarily decreased their risk of HIV infection.","Kavanagh, Nolan M; Marcus, Noora; Bosire, Risper; Otieno, Brian; Bair, Elizabeth F; Agot, Kawango; Thirumurthy, Harsha",JAMA Netw Open,486,12

Our study aimed at assessing the frequency of vascular and extravascular events' distribution in a retrospective cohort of 42 COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Patients were evaluated by whole-body CT angiography between March 16 and April 30, 2020. Twenty-three out of the 42 patients evaluated were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Vascular and extravascular findings were categorized into ""relevant"" or ""other/incidental,"" first referring to the need for immediate patient care and management. Student T-test, Mann-Whitney U test, or Fisher exact test was used to compare study groups, where appropriate. RESULTS: Relevant vascular events were recorded in 71.4% of cases (n = 30). Pulmonary embolism was the most frequent in both ICU and non-ICU cases (56.5% vs. 10.5%, p = 0.002). Ischemic infarctions at several sites such as the gut, spleen, liver, brain, and kidney were detected (n = 20), with multi-site involvement in some cases. Systemic venous thrombosis occurred in 30.9% of cases compared to 7.1% of systemic arterial events, the first being significantly higher in ICU patients (p = 0.002). Among incidental findings, small-sized splanchnic arterial aneurysms were reported in 21.4% of the study population, with no significant differences in ICU and non-ICU patients. CONCLUSIONS: Vascular involvement is not negligible in COVID-19 and should be carefully investigated as it may significantly affect disease behavior and prognosis.

Quite recently, blood clots have emerged as the common factor unifying many of the symptoms initially attributed without an explanation to COVID-19. Cardiovascular biomarkers and particularly, D-dimer and troponin appear to be very powerful prognostic markers, signaling the need for earlier and more aggressive interventions and treatments in order to avoid and/or minimize arterial/venous thromboembolism and myocardial infarct. The ultrasound imaging patterns at both the lung and peripheral vascular level can also be very useful weapons that have the advantage of being able to monitor longitudinally the clinical picture, something that real-time PCR/nasopharyngeal swab is not able to do and that CT can only pursue with significant radiation exposure.

Many licensed vaccines confer protection by inducing long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs) and memory B cells (MBCs), cell types canonically generated during germinal center (GC) reactions. Here, we directly compared two vaccine platforms-mRNA vaccines and a recombinant protein formulated with an MF59-like adjuvant-looking for their abilities to quantitatively and qualitatively shape SARS-CoV-2-specific primary GC responses over time. We demonstrated that a single immunization with SARS-CoV-2 mRNA, but not with the recombinant protein vaccine, elicited potent SARS-CoV-2-specific GC B and T follicular helper (Tfh) cell responses as well as LLPCs and MBCs. Importantly, GC responses strongly correlated with neutralizing antibody production. mRNA vaccines more efficiently induced key regulators of the Tfh cell program and influenced the functional properties of Tfh cells.

The COVID-19 pandemic, however, limited these in-person opportunities. Therefore, we hypothesized that applicants of the 2021 cycle would be more likely to match into programs with which they have existing geographic connections when compared to previous years. DESIGN: Residency websites and social media accounts were searched for resident names and educational information for those matching in 2021 and 2015 to 2020. Outcomes included proportion of applicants matching at the program affiliated with their medical school (""home program""), or matching in the same state or United States Census Map region as their medical school or undergraduate institution. Subgroup analyses were stratified by program region, incoming resident class size, and Doximity residency reputation ranking. SETTING: Columbia University (New York). PARTICIPANTS: For the 2015 to 2020 residency cycles, 963 residents were identified from 78 (95.1%) programs. For 2021, 159 incoming interns were identified from 70 (82.3%) programs. RESULTS: 2021 applicants matched into their home program at higher rates than 2015-2020 applicants (36.0% vs. 24.1%, p â¯=â¯0.019). This trend was similar regardless of program region or size. This increase was significant for programs ranked outside of the top 30 (41.5% vs. 26.4%, p = 0.032), but not for the top 30 programs (32.1% vs. 22.3%, pâ¯=â¯0.128). Excluding those who matched at their home program, 2015 to 2020 and 2021 applicants matched in the same state or region of their medical school or undergraduate institution at similar rates (p > 0.05 for all). CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, plastic surgery residency programs matched more applicants from affiliated medical schools than in previous years. This may result from lack of in-person opportunities for applicants at other programs. Alternative relationship-building opportunities may facilitate broader geographic connections in the 2022 cycle.","Asadourian, Paul A; Murphy, Alexander I; Marano, Andrew A; Rohde, Christine H; Wu, June K",J. surg. educ,486,29

The goal of this study was to determine the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccine in patients with CLL. We evaluated humoral immune responses to the BNT162b2 messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccine in patients with CLL and compared responses with those obtained in age-matched healthy control subjects. Patients received 2 vaccine doses, 21 days apart, and antibody titers were measured by using the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S assay after administration of the second dose. In a total of 167 patients with CLL, the antibody response rate was 39.5%. A comparison between 52 patients with CLL and 52 sex- and aged-matched healthy control subjects revealed a significantly reduced response rate among patients (52% vs 100%, respectively; adjusted odds ratio, 0.010; 95% confidence interval, 0.001-0.162; P < .001). The response rate was highest in patients who obtained clinical remission after treatment (79.2%), followed by 55.2% in treatment-naive patients and 16.0% in patients under treatment at the time of vaccination. In patients treated with either Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors or venetoclax ± anti-CD20 antibody, response rates were considerably low (16.0% and 13.6%). None of the patients exposed to anti-CD20 antibodies <12 months before vaccination responded. In a multivariate analysis, the independent predictors of response were younger age, female sex, lack of currently active treatment, immunoglobulin G levels &#8805;550 mg/dL, and immunoglobulin M levels &#8805;40 mg/dL. In conclusion, antibody-mediated response to the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in patients with CLL is markedly impaired and affected by disease activity and treatment.

In order to provide a basis for clinical diagnosis, this study retrospectively analyzed the imaging characteristics, evolution and related imaging manifestations of COVID-19 patients in different stages of the disease. The results suggest that the imaging findings of 48 COVID-19 patients from Hengyang, Hunan Province are comparable in different stages of the disease. Chest CT showed no pneumonia in one mild patient. Chest CT findings of moderate type (n=38) and severe type (n=9) had comparable characteristics. The main manifestations were ground-glass opacity (GGO) (18/38, 47.37%;1/9, 11.11%), and GGO with consolidation (16/38, 42.11%;5/9, 55.56%), which respectively presented in bilateral lungs (34/38, 89.47%;9/9, 100.00%), and multi-lobe distribution (involving 5 lobes) (17/38, 44.74%;8/9, 88.89%).

As of 24 April 2020, Lombardy was the worst hit Italian region and entirely separated from all the others. Sensitivity analysis-by excluding data from Lombardy-partitioned the remaining regions into four clusters. Although cluster 1 (i.e. Veneto) and 2 (i.e. Piedmont and Emilia-Romagna) included the most hit regions beyond Lombardy, this partition reflected differences in the efficacy of restrictions and testing strategies. Cluster 3 was heterogeneous and comprised regions where the epidemic started later and/or where it spread with the lowest intensity. Regions within cluster 4 were those where the epidemic started slightly after Veneto, Emilia-Romagna and Piedmont, favoring timely adoption of control measures.

Reporting radiographers provide a cost-effective and safe solution for managing CXR backlogs, but not all Trusts support this service development. This study aimed to establish the service enablers and challenges associated with training and employing radiographers to report CXR images in acute hospital sites in England, UK. METHODS: Approval for this electronic survey was granted in 84 of 146 (58%) Trusts approached. The survey was open for 10 weeks during August to October 2020, comprising of qualitative and quantitative questions. Data was exported in to an Excel spreadsheet where manual thematic analysis was performed. Descriptive statistics were also generated. RESULTS: Sample size was 75 (89% response rate). Thirty-three departments (44%) had at least one trainee. Most departments (n = 53, 71%) employ at least one CXR reporting radiographer. A total of 121/160 (76%) radiographers report CXRs. Number of reporting sessions shows progression. Factors enabling training and employment arise from service improvements, financial pressures, and developing the workforce. The main challenges relate to staffing issues with a number of associated sub-themes. A small faction indicated lack of radiographer interest to report CXRs due to litigation worries; possibly uncovering a new and emerging issue. CONCLUSION: Enablers and challenges associated with radiographers reporting CXRs are similar to previous studies. The growth of CXR reporting radiographers and reporting sessions indicates a continuing reliance on radiographers to contributing to managing CXR backlogs. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: It is recommended that potential trainees are explicitly informed of the legal protection that will be provided, to prevent accountability concerns impacting on the continuing progression in this area of advanced practice.","Stevens, B J; Skermer, L; Davies, J","Radiography (Lond.

We found that antibody sequences from different discovery cohorts shared biochemical properties and could be retrieved across validation cohorts confirming the stereotyped character of this naive response in COVID-19. While neutralizing antibody sequences were found independently of disease severity in line with serological data, individual non-neutralizing antibody sequences were associated with fatal clinical courses suggesting detrimental effects of these antibodies. We mined 200 immune repertoires of healthy individuals and 500 of patients with blood or solid cancers - all acquired prior to the pandemic - for SARS-CoV-2 antibody sequences. While the largely unmutated B cell rearrangements occurred in a substantial fraction of immune repertoires from young and healthy individuals, these sequences were less likely found in individuals over 60 years of age and in cancer. This reflects B cell repertoire restriction in aging and cancer and may to a certain extent explain the different clinical COVID-19 courses observed in these risk groups.

PARTICIPANTS: This trial is conducted in 3 hospitals in Switzerland, 1 hospital in Brazil and 1 hospital in Mexico (academic and non-academic). All patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection requiring hospitalization for at least 3 calendar days for severe COVID-19 will be screened for study eligibility. INCLUSION CRITERIA: - Signed informed consent - Age 18-85 years - Evidence of pulmonary involvement on CT scan or X-ray of the chest - Duration of symptoms associated with COVID-19 &#8804; 10 days - At least one of the following risk factors for progression to mechanical ventilation on the day of enrolment: 1) Arterial hypertension 2) &#8805; 50 years 3) Obesity (BMI &#8805; 30 kg/m2) 4) History of cardiovascular disease 5) Chronic pulmonary disease 6) Chronic renal disease 7) C-reactive protein > 35mg/L 8) Oxygen saturation at rest of &#8804; 94% when breathing ambient air Exclusion criteria: - Incapacity or inability to provide informed consent - Contraindications to the class of drugs under investigation (C1 esterase inhibitor) - Treatment with tocilizumab or another IL-6R or IL-6 inhibitor before enrolment - History or suspicion of allergy to rabbits - Pregnancy or breast feeding - Active or anticipated treatment with any other complement inhibitor - Liver cirrhosis (any Child-Pugh score) - Admission to an ICU on the day or anticipated within the next 24 hours of enrolment - Invasive or non-invasive ventilation - Participation in another study with any investigational drug within the 30 days prior to enrolment - Enrolment of the study investigators, their family members, employees and other closely related or dependent persons INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Patients randomized to the experimental arm will receive conestat alfa in addition to standard of care (SOC). Conestat alfa (8400 U followed by 4200 U every 8 hours) will be administered as a slow intravenous injection (5-10 minutes) over a 72-hour period (i.e. 9 administrations in total). The first conestat alfa treatment will be administered on the day of enrolment. The control group will receive SOC only. SOC treatment will be administered according to local institutional guidelines, including supplemental oxygen, antibiotics, corticosteroids, remdesivir, and anticoagulation. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary endpoint of this trial is disease severity on day 7 after enrolment assessed by an adapted WHO Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement (score 0 will be omitted and score 6 and 7 will be combined) from 1 (no limitation of activities) to 7 (death). Secondary outcomes include (i) the time to clinical improvement (time from randomization to an improvement of two points on the WHO ordinal scale or discharge from hospital) within 14 days after enrolment, (ii) the proportion of participants alive and not having required invasive or non-invasive ventilation at 14 days after enrolment and (iii) the proportion of subjects without an acute lung injury (defined by PaO2/FiO2 ratio of &#8804;300mmHg) within 14 days after enrolment. Exploratory outcomes include virological clearance, C1 esterase inhibitor pharmacokinetics and changes in routine laboratory parameters and inflammatory proteins. RANDOMISATION: Subjects will be randomised in a 2:1 ratio to treatment with conestat alfa in addition to SOC or SOC only. Randomization is performed via an interactive web response system (SecuTrial®). BLINDING (MASKING): In this open-label trial, participants, caregivers and outcome assessors are not blinded to group assignment. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): We will randomise approximately 120 individuals (80 in the active treatment arm, 40 in the SOC group). Two interim analyses after 40 and 80 patients are planned according to the Pocock adjusted levels &#945;p = 0.0221. The results of the interim analysis will allow adjustment of the sample size (Lehmacher, Wassmer, 1999). TRIAL STATUS: PROTECT-COVID-19 protocol version 3.0 (July 07 2020). Participant recruitment started on July 30 2020 in one center (Basel, Switzerland, first participant included on August 06 2020). In four of five study centers patients are actively recruited. Participation of the fifth study center (Mexico) is anticipated by mid December 2020. Completion of trial recruitment depends on the development of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

The main organ affected in this infection is the lung and the virus uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor to enter the target cells. In this context, a controversy raised regarding the use of renin-angiotensin system (RAAS) blockers, as these drugs might increase ACE2 expression in some tissues and potentially increase the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. This is specially concerning in diabetic patients as diabetes is a risk factor for COVID-19. METHODS: 12-week old diabetic mice (db/db) were treated with ramipril, or vehicle control for 8 weeks. Non-diabetic db/m mice were included as controls. ACE2 expression and activity were studied in lung, kidney and heart of these animals. RESULTS: Kidney ACE2 activity was increased in the db/db mice as compared to the db/m (143.2% ± 23% vs 100% ± 22.3%, p = 0.004), whereas ramipril had no significant effect. In the lung, no differences were found in ACE2 when comparing db/db mice to db/m and ramipril also had no significant effect. In the heart, diabetes decreased ACE2 activity (83% ± 16.8%, vs 100% ± 23.1% p = 0.02), and ramipril increased ACE2 significantly (83% ± 16.8% vs 98.2% ± 15%, p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: In a mouse model of type 2 diabetes, ramipril had no significant effect on ACE2 activity in either kidneys or in the lungs. Therefore, it is unlikely that RAAS blockers or at least angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection through increasing ACE2.","Vergara, Ander; Jacobs-Cachá, Conxita; Molina-Van den Bosch, Mireia; Domínguez-Báez, Pamela; Benito, Begoña; García-Carro, Clara; Serón, Daniel; Soler, María José",Mol Cell Endocrinol,486,16

It is a very complex systemic disease in terms of pathogenesis, treatment, and prognosis. Pharmacological treatment may include antiviral and antimalarial drugs, antibiotics, monoclonal antibodies, corticosteroids as well as low-molecular-weight heparins to prevent the evolution of the disease from reaching the severe inflammatory phase that can lead to respiratory complications, multiple organ failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and finally death. Therefore, pending the development of the much sought-after vaccine, there needs to be a multidisciplinary approach to tackling this disease, and it is essential to use different medical treatments at the correct pathogenic moment. The aim of this article is to evaluate the rationale and reason behind the use of antirheumatic drugs, by expert point of view, in the various phases of the disease. Another important aspect in the management of the disease is to identify patients at high risk, both to change their lifestyle and to correct the state of their health through non-pharmacological measures for improving their immuno-balance. Our literature review reveals the important role and the therapeutic potential of antirheumatic agents in preventing the progression of the disease and aiding recovery from the disease. However, there is a lack of clinical evidence to support the use of these agents, indicating that further randomized controlled studies are required.","Valentini, Marco; Zmerly, Hassan",J Popul Ther Clin Pharmacol,486,1

The degree of STS, perceived stress and burnout was assessed using the Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale (STSS), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Maslach Burnout Inventory Human Service Survey (MBI-HSS) respectively. Stepwise multiple regression analysis was performed to identify potential risk and protective factors for STS; (3) Results: 184 HCWs (M = 90; Age mean: 46.45; SD: 11.02) completed the survey. A considerable proportion of HCWs had symptoms of STS (41.3%), emotional exhaustion (56.0%), and depersonalization (48.9%). The prevalence of STS was 47.5% in frontline HCWs while in HCWs working in other units it was 30.3% (p < 0.023); 67.1% for the HCWs exposed to patients' death and 32.9% for those HCWs which were not exposed to the same condition (p < 0.001). In stepwise multiple regression analysis, perceived stress, emotional exhaustion, and exposure to patients' death remained as significant predictors in the final model for STS (adjusted R2 = 0.537, p < 0.001); (4) Conclusions: During the current COVID-19 pandemic, HCWs facing patients' physical pain, psychological suffering, and death are more likely to develop STS.","Orrù, Graziella; Marzetti, Francesca; Conversano, Ciro; Vagheggini, Guido; Miccoli, Mario; Ciacchini, Rebecca; Panait, Eugenia; Gemignani, Angelo",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),486,24

TSWs often experience violence from clients, police, and others, but it is estimated that 50% of these acts of violence are at the hands of their intimate partners. The marginalization of TSWs is fueled by abuse through isolation and shaming which prevents them from seeking help through formal channels like police or counselling services. There is limited research on intimate partner violence (IPV) involving transgender sex workers (biologically male at birth who transition to women) and their partners who are typically heterosexual/bisexual men. In China, stigmatization, homophobia, heterosexism, and transphobia structurally disadvantage TSWs and this power structure tacitly supports violence and abuse against them. To survive, TSWs rely on informal networks with their 'sisters' for advice and emotional support which is more effective at combatting IPV than criminal justice or social policy efforts. Ethnographic data from in-depth interviews with 25 TSWs provide insight about IPV and how informal social support is a protective factor that helps them cope with routine acts of violence. The findings identify the importance of the 'sisterhood' and how it protects and helps TSWs manage their physical and mental health.","Tsang, Eileen Yuk-Ha",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),486,16

This study explored the experiences and perspectives of volunteer contact tracers in order to identify facilitators, challenges, and novel solutions for implementing COVID-19 contact tracing. METHODS: As part of a study to evaluate an emergently established volunteer contact tracing program for COVID-19 in New Haven, Connecticut, April-June 2020, we conducted focus groups with 36 volunteer contact tracers, thematically analyzed the data, and synthesized the findings using the RE-AIM implementation framework. RESULTS: To successfully reach cases and contacts, participants recommended identifying clients' outreach preferences, engaging clients authentically, and addressing sources of mistrust. Participants felt that the effectiveness of successful isolation and quarantine was contingent on minimizing delays in reaching clients and on systematically assessing and addressing their nutritional, financial, and housing needs. They felt that successful adoption of a volunteer-driven contact tracing model depended on the ability to recruit self-motivated contact tracers and provide rapid training and consistent, supportive supervision. Participants noted that implementation could be enhanced with better management tools, such as more engaging interview scripts, user-friendly data management software, and protocols for special situations and populations. They also emphasized the value of coordinating outreach efforts with other involved providers and agencies. Finally, they believed that long-term maintenance of a volunteer-driven program requires monetary or educational incentives to sustain participation. CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the first studies to qualitatively examine implementation of a volunteer-run COVID-19 contact tracing program. Participants identified facilitators, barriers, and potential solutions for improving implementation of COVID-19 contact tracing in this context. These included standardized communication skills training, supportive supervision, and peer networking to improve implementation, as well as greater cooperation with outside agencies, flexible scheduling, and volunteer incentives to promote sustainability.","Shelby, Tyler; Hennein, Rachel; Schenck, Christopher; Clark, Katie; Meyer, Amanda J; Goodwin, Justin; Weeks, Brian; Bond, Maritza; Niccolai, Linda; Davis, J Lucian; Grau, Lauretta E",PLoS One,486,20

In the United States more than 25 million people have been infected with SARS-CoV-2. To date, COVID-19 has killed close to 400,000 U.S. citizens. In the face of limited pharmacotherapies, the current burden of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 signals overwhelming sickness and trillions in healthcare costs ahead. The need to expeditiously identify safe and efficacious prophylaxis and treatment options is critical. Drug repositioning may be a promising strategy toward mitigating the impact of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. This rapid review appraises available evidence on the viability of vintage antimalarial drugs chloroquine (CHQ) and its analog hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) repositioned for SARS-CoV-2 prophylaxis and COVID-19 treatment. Findings suggest neither the use of CHQ nor HCQ singularly, or concomitantly, with azithromycin and/or zinc provide definitive benefits for use against SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 illness. Moreover, administration of these medications was linked to significant and sometimes fatal complications.","Powell-Young, Yolanda M; Alzaghari, Omar; Reyes-Miranda, Clara; Coleman, Bernice; Strickland, Ora L; Gordon, Yhovana; Aroke, Edwin; Lewis Iii, Henry; Giger, Joyce Newman",J Natl Black Nurses Assoc,486,1

To fulfill this need, we turn to the task of open-domain question-answering, which we can use to efficiently find answers to free-text questions from a large set of documents. In this work, we present such a system for the emergent domain of COVID-19. Despite the small data size available, we are able to successfully train the system to retrieve answers from a large-scale corpus of published COVID-19 scientific papers. Furthermore, we incorporate effective re-ranking and question-answering techniques, such as document diversity and multiple answer spans.

Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes are emerging as critical determinants of both SARS-CoV-2 infection severity and long-term immunity, either after recovery or vaccination. A hallmark of COVID-19 is its highly variable severity and breadth of immune responses between individuals. To address the underlying mechanisms behind this phenomenon we analyzed the proteolytic processing of S1 spike glycoprotein precursor antigenic peptides by 10 common allotypes of ER aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP1), a polymorphic intracellular enzyme that can regulate cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses by generating or destroying antigenic peptides. We utilized a systematic proteomic approach that allows the concurrent analysis of hundreds of trimming reactions in parallel, thus better emulating antigen processing in the cell. While all ERAP1 allotypes were capable of producing optimal ligands for MHC class I molecules, including known SARS-CoV-2 epitopes, they presented significant differences in peptide sequences produced, suggesting allotype-dependent sequence biases. Allotype 10, previously suggested to be enzymatically deficient, was rather found to be functionally distinct from other allotypes. Our findings suggest that common ERAP1 allotypes can be a major source of heterogeneity in antigen processing and through this mechanism contribute to variable immune responses to COVID-19.","Stamatakis, George; Samiotaki, Martina; Temponeras, Ioannis; Panayotou, George; Stratikos, Efstratios",,486,26

When people are physically isolated and distant from each other, technology may play a fundamental role by enabling social connection and reducing feelings of loneliness caused by this prolonged social isolation. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many mental health services worldwide have had to shift their routine face-to-face outpatient appointments to remote telepsychiatry encounters. The increased pressure on mental health services highlights the importance of community-led health-promotion interventions, which can contribute to preventing mental illness or their relapses, and to reduce the burden on health services. Patients with psychosis are particularly socially isolated, have sedentary lifestyles, and commonly face stigma and discrimination from the general population. At the same time, patients with psychosis value technology, are interested in, use and own smart-phones to digitally connect, and are satisfied with their use. Thus, among psychosocial interventions, a helpful resource may be ""Phone Pal,"" a complex intervention which facilitates remote communication between volunteers and socially isolated patients with psychosis through different smart-phone tools. While ""Phone Pal"" has been originally developed for people with psychosis, it may also be useful to the wider population, helping to overcome the social isolation caused by physical distancing, particularly in these times of widespread isolation. ""Phone Pal"" may be a potential public health resource for society, providing important support to those that may need it the most, and possibly benefit most from it.","Pinto da Costa, Mariana",Eur Psychiatry,486,1

The morphometric features of the normal cerebellum in guinea pigs have not been previously investigated using stereology. The objective of the present work was to establish normal volumetric and quantitative stereological parameters for cerebellar tissues in guinea pigs, by means of unbiased design-based stereology. Cerebellar total volume, gray and white matter volume fractions, molecular and granular layers volume fractions, cerebellar surface area, Purkinje cellular and nuclear volumes, and the Purkinje cell total count were stereologically estimated. For this purpose, cerebellar hemispheres from six adult male guinea pigs were employed. Isotropic, uniform random sections were obtained by applying the orientator method, and subsequently processed for light microscopy. The cerebellar total volume, the white and grey matter volume fractions, and the molecular and granular layer volumes were estimated using the Cavalieri's principle and the point counting system. The cerebellar surface area was estimated through the use of test lines; Purkinje cellular and nuclear volumes were analysed using the nucleator technique, whereas the Purkinje cell total count was obtained by means of the optical disector technique. The mean ± standard deviation total volume of a guinea-pig cerebellar hemisphere was 0.11 ± 0.01 cm3 . The mean volumetric proportions occupied by the gray and white matters were, respectively, 78.0 ± 2.6% and 22.0 ± 2.6%, whereas their mean absolute volumes were found to be 0.21 ± 0.02 cm3 and 0.059 ± 0.006 cm3 . The volumes of the molecular and granular layers were estimated at 112.4 ± 20.6 mm3 and 104.4 ± 7.3 mm3 , whereas their mean thicknesses were calculated to be 0.184 ± 0.020 mm and 0.17 ± 0.02 mm. The molecular and granular layers accounted for 40.7 ± 3.9% and 37.4 ± 1.8% of total cerebellar volume respectively. The surface area of the cerebellum measured 611.4 ± 96.8 mm2 . Purkinje cells with a cellular volume of 3210.1 µm3 and with a nuclear volume of 470.9 µm3 had a higher incidence of occurrence. The mean total number of Purkinje cells for a cerebellar hemisphere was calculated to be 253,090 ± 34,754. The morphometric data emerging from the present study provide a set of reference data which might prove valuable as basic anatomical contribution for practical applications in veterinary neurology.","De Silva, Margherita; Sadeghinezhad, Javad; Nyengaard, Jens R; Aghabalazadeh Asl, Mahdi; Saeidi, Ava; De Sordi, Nadia; Chiocchetti, Roberto; Grandis, Annamaria",J. anat,486,1

Methods: On April 20 th, 2020, we search MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health, Scopus, Web of Science and MedXriv. We used terms related to COVID-19, smell and taste disorders. We selected case series, cross-sectional, case-control and cohort studies. We included studies with COVID-19 patients describing their symptoms; studies that compared smell and taste disorders between COVID-19 patients and otherwise healthy subjects; and studies comparing smell and taste disorders between COVID-19 severe and mild/moderate cases. Because of methodological heterogeneity and the limited number of results, a qualitative synthesis is presented. Results: From 31 reports, we selected six (n=2,757). Six studies reported the proportion of smell and taste disorders among COVID-19 patients. Two reports studied whether smell and taste disorders were independently associated with COVID-19 diagnosis. No reports studied the association with impaired outcomes among COVID-19 patients. The frequency of anosmia ranged between 22%-68%. The definition of taste disorders varied greatly, with dysgeusia present in 33% and ageusia in 20%. People who reported loss of smell and taste had six-fold higher odds of being COVID-19 positive; similarly, anosmia and ageusia were associated with 10-fold higher odds of COVID-19 diagnosis. Conclusions: The frequency of smell and taste disorders is as high as other symptoms, thus, at least anosmia for which the definition was more consistent, could be included in lists of COVID-19 symptoms. Although there is promising evidence, it is premature to conclude that smell and taste disorders are strongly associated with COVID-19 diagnosis.

To address these challenges, we investigate utterance recommendations that contextually provide analytic guidance by suggesting data features (e.g., attributes, values, trends) while implicitly making users aware of the types of phrasings that an NLI supports. We present SNOWY, a prototype system that generates and recommends utterances for visual analysis based on a combination of data interestingness metrics and language pragmatics.

In CAP platelet biosynthesis of TxA2 is augmented and associated with myocardial infarction; however, a cause-effect relationship is still unclear as unclear is if platelet activation promotes thrombosis or functional changes of coronary tree such vasospasm. Retrospective studies suggested a potential role of aspirin in reducing mortality but the impact on vascular disease is still unknown. Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is complicated by thrombosis in roughly 20% of patients with an almost equivalent localization in arterial and venous circulation. Platelet activation seems to have a pivot role in the thrombotic process in Covid-19 as consistently evidenced by its involvement in promoting Tissue Factor up-regulation via leucocyte interaction.

It has become more critical during the COVID-19 pandemic than ever before. This study aimed to determine the knowledge, attitudes, practices of hand hygiene among final-year medical students. It also explored reported hand hygiene behavior before the COVID-19 pandemic and the need for educational strategies to correct the deficiencies. METHODS: A concurrent mixed-method approach was used. In the quantitative strand, a cross-sectional online survey was carried out via a Google form. Mann-Whitney U test and Chi-squared test were used for comparisons. In the qualitative strand, twelve participants were interviewed, based on a semi-structured interview guide and audio recorded. Transcribed data were evaluated with thematic content analysis. RESULTS: A total of 225 final-year medical students were studied in the quantitative strand. Most were females. The mean score for knowledge was 3.35 ± 0.795 out of six. Of them, 31.6 % of participants scored below 3 points (< 50 % of the total). Most (78.9 %) had positive attitudes (score of > 80 %). Only 36.4 % reported ""adequate"" hand hygiene performance in all eight dimensions of the behavior domain. Noticeably, fewer participants reported to clean their hands after checking blood pressure (55.6 %), and only 66.2 % stated carrying a hand sanitizer in their pocket. Significant correlations were not found between reported behavior and attitudes (p = 0.821) or knowledge (p = 0.794). The qualitative strand with 12 respondents revealed the positive influence of both hierarchical and non-hierarchal role models. Time constraints, skin irritation, and workload pressures were the main barriers. Frequent reminders, supervision, and interactive teaching were suggested as methods to improve hand hygiene compliance. They also stated that increased enthusiasm was noted on hand hygiene during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic period. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the participants had positive attitudes towards hand hygiene. Yet, a considerable gap between attitudes and knowledge and reported hand hygiene behavior was evident.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, 33 patients (18 men, 15 women; median age, 49.0 years) with confirmed with moderate COVID-19 pneumonia in a multicenter hospital were included. The patients underwent at least four chest non-contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scans at approximately 5-day intervals. We analyzed the clinical and CT characteristics of the patients. Moreover, the total CT score and the sum of lung involvement were determined for every CT scan. RESULTS: The most widespread presenting symptoms were fever (32/33, 97.0%) and cough (17/33, 51.5%), which were often accompanied by decreased lymphocyte count (15/33, 45.5%) and increased C-reactive protein levels (18/33, 54.6%). Bilateral, multifocal ground glass opacities (32/33, 97.0%), consolidation (25/33, 75.8%), vascular thickening (23/33, 69.7%), and bronchial wall thickening (21/33, 63.6%) with peripheral distribution were the most frequent CT findings during moderate COVID-19 pneumonia. In patients recovering from moderate COVID-19 pneumonia, four stages (stages 1-4) of evolution were identified on chest CT with average CT scores of 3.4±2.3, 6.0±4.4, 5.6±3.8, and 4.9±3.2, respectively, from the onset of symptoms. For most patients, the peak of average total CT score increased for approximately 8 days after the onset of symptoms, after which it decreased gradually. The mean CT score of all patients was 4.7 at the time of discharge. CONCLUSION: The moderate COVID-19 pneumonia CT score increased rapidly in a short period of time initially, followed by a slow decline over a relatively long time. The peak of the course occurred in stage 2. Complete recovery of patients with moderate COVID-19 pneumonia with high mean CT score at the time of discharge requires longer time.","Zhang, Hua; Liu, Xiaohong; Yu, Peng; Cheng, Mingyuan; Wang, Weiting; Sun, Yipeng; Zeng, Bingliang; Fan, Bing",J Xray Sci Technol,486,26

However, the role of S100A9 in lung injury in sepsis has not been fully investigated. Therefore, the present study aimed to determine the role of S100A9 in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lung injury murine model and its underlying molecular mechanisms. METHODS: LPS was utilized to induce sepsis and lung injury in C57BL/6 or NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3)-/- mice. To investigate the effects of S100A9 blockade, mice were treated with a specific inhibitor of S100A9. Subsequently, lung injury and inflammation were evaluated by histology and enzyme­linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. Furthermore, western blot analysis and RT-qPCR were carried out to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of S100A9. RESULTS: S100A9 was upregulated in the lung tissues of LPS-treated mice. However, inhibition of S100A9 alleviated LPS-induced lung injury. Additionally, S100A9 blockade also attenuated the inflammatory responses and apoptosis in the lungs of LPS-challenged mice. Furthermore, the increased expression of NLRP3 was also suppressed by S100A9 blockade, while S100A9 blockade had no effect on NLRP3-/- mice. In vitro, S100A9 downregulation mitigated LPS-induced inflammation. Interestingly, these effects were blunted by NLRP3 overexpression. CONCLUSION: The results of the current study suggested that inhibition of S100A9 could protect against LPS-induced lung injury via inhibiting the NLRP3 pathway. Therefore, S100A9 blockade could be considered as a novel therapeutic strategy for lung injury in sepsis.","Zhao, Boying; Lu, Renfu; Chen, Jianjun; Xie, Ming; Zhao, Xingji; Kong, Lingwen",Respir Res,486,17

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the cases of parturients diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection disease (COVID-19). Their epidemiologic history, chest computed tomography scans, laboratory measurements, and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid positivity were evaluated. We also recorded the patients' demographic and clinical characteristics, anesthesia and surgery-related data, maternal and neonatal complications, as well as the health status of the involved medical staff. RESULTS: The clinical characteristics of 17 pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 were similar to those previously reported in non-pregnant adult patients. All of the 17 patients underwent Cesarean delivery with anesthesia performed according to standardized anesthesia/surgery procedures. Fourteen of the patients underwent continuous epidural anesthesia with 12 experiencing significant intraoperative hypotension. Three patients received general anesthesia with tracheal intubation because emergency surgery was needed. Three of the parturients are still recovering from their Cesarean delivery and are receiving in-hospital treatment for COVID-19. Three neonates were born prematurely. There were no deaths or serious neonatal asphyxia events. All neonatal SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests were negative. No medical staff were infected throughout the patient care period. CONCLUSIONS: Both epidural and general anesthesia were safely used for Cesarean delivery in the parturients with COVID-19. Nevertheless, the incidence of hypotension during epidural anesthesia appeared excessive. Proper patient transfer, medical staff access procedures, and effective biosafety precautions are important to protect medical staff from COVID-19.","Chen, Rong; Zhang, Yuan; Huang, Lei; Cheng, Bi-Heng; Xia, Zhong-Yuan; Meng, Qing-Tao",Can J Anaesth,486,16

The relationship between MS and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is uncertain. The aim of the study was to collect and analyze this relationship. METHODS: All MS patients of the Neurological Outpatient Clinic in Zabrze, Poland, were regularly questioned for the symptoms of COVID-19 and contact with an infected person. Patients that presented with COVID-19 symptoms or confirmed contact with an infected person were referred for the COVID-19 test. All patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 41) were included in the analysis. Medical records of the study group were analyzed. Patient condition was monitored in the outpatient clinic after recovery. In 26 subjects, additional examinations, including brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electroneurography (ENG), electroencephalography (EEG), color duplex Doppler (CDD), visual evoked potentials (VEPs), brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) and psychological assessment were performed following recovery. RESULTS: Only one patient required hospitalization during COVID-19 infection, whereas 87.80% of patients did not require treatment for COVID-19. In all patients, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were below 10 mg/L. In 2.44% of patients, oxygen partial pressure was below 95%. In most MS patients, the results of further examinations after COVID-19 infection were similar to those prior to infection. Psychological assessment revealed that anxiety was found in 42.31% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: A mild course of COVID-19 in MS patients seems common despite disease-modifying drug treatment and disability. Self-isolation is recommended to reduce the number of infected patients. COVID-19 infection did not worsen the course of MS in most subjects. Patients with MS may require additional psychological support during the pandemic due to their susceptibility to anxiety.","Nowak-Kiczmer, Maria; Kubicka-Baczyk, Katarzyna; Niedziela, Natalia; Adamczyk, Bozena; Wierzbicki, Krzysztof; Bartman, Wojciech; Adamczyk-Sowa, Monika",Mult Scler Relat Disord,486,21

Executive nurses and hospital administrations need reliable open-source measures to monitor burnout and prioritize nurses for intervention as Lebanon struggles with the multiple crises compounded by rising numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Objectives: The study aimed to determine whether the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory scales are suitable for settings experiencing multiple crises. Its objectives were to investigate the CBI scales' measurement properties, identify burnout levels in a sample of nurses experiencing compound stressors, assess whether the scales' three-dimensional burnout model is plausible, and establish norms for using the scales in work settings subject to compound external stressors. Methods: The study is a psychometric analysis of the anonymous survey data of 142 registered nurses working in acute hospitals in Lebanon. We fitted the data to unidimensional and multidimensional Rasch rating scale models. Item fit, person separation and reliability, targeting, differential item functioning, and scale norms were estimated. Results: Nurses in the sample had a high level of burnout. The Copenhagen Burnout Inventory scales have excellent reliability. The personal burnout and work-related scales were highly correlated and moderately correlated with the client-related burnout scale. Possible differential functioning in the work-related burnout scale requires further investigation. Conclusion: More extensive and diverse studies in workplaces subjected to compound stressors are required to confirm the study results. Meanwhile, executive nurses and hospital administrations can use the norms reported to prioritize nurses for burnout prevention and intervention programs. In Lebanon, our reported CBI scale values can be used as baseline standards for studies tracking how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting the nursing workforce. © The Author(s) 2021.","Clinton, M.; Shehadeh, Msn Rn R.",SAGE Open Nursing,486,13

Here, we applied density functional theory calculations to study the Al-doping effect on the sensitivity of a ZnO nanosheet to HCHO gas, explaining the experimental results. We found that the pristine ZnO nanosheet weakly interacts with the HCHO with adsorption energy (Ead) of -9.3 kcal/mol, and the sensing response (S) value of 2.2 at 623 K. After the Al-doping process, the Ead and S values increase to -40.7 kcal/mol and 83.9, respectively, indicating an excellent agreement with the experimental results. We showed a relation between the HOMO-LUMO gap and the S value, confirming with the experimental results. Also, the proposed Al-doped ZnO nanosheet shows a good selectivity to HCHO gas at the presence of H2, NH3, C2H5OH, CO, and CH4 gases. A short recovery time of 18 s is predicted for Al-ZnO-based sensor which is comparable with the experimental value of 26 s. Finally, we conclude that the Al-doping makes the ZnO nanosheet a promising HCHO gas sensor with a high sensitivity, an excellent selectivity, and short recovery time.","Fang, Yu; Yang, Dong Dong; Xiang, Cai Yun; Shi, Min; Zhao, Huan; Asadi, H",J Mol Graph Model,486,21

Several repurposing pharmaceutical candidates have been reported or envisaged to inhibit the emerging infections of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), but their binding sites, binding affinities and inhibitory mechanisms are still unavailable. In this study, we use the ligand-protein docking program and molecular dynamic simulation to ab initio investigate the binding mechanism and inhibitory ability of seven clinically approved drugs (Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine, Remdesivir, Ritonavir, Beclabuvir, Indinavir and Favipiravir) and a recently designed α-ketoamide inhibitor (13b) at the molecular level. The results suggest that Chloroquine has the strongest binding affinity with 3CL hydrolase (Mpro) among clinically approved drugs, indicating its effective inhibitory ability for SARS-CoV-2. However, the newly designed inhibitor 13b shows potentially improved inhibition efficiency with larger binding energy compared with Chloroquine. We further calculate the important binding site residues at the active site and demonstrate that the MET 165 and HIE 163 contribute the most for 13b, while the MET 165 and GLN 189 for Chloroquine, based on residual energy decomposition analysis. The proposed work offers a higher research priority for 13b to treat the infection of SARS-CoV-2 and provides theoretical basis for further design of effective drug molecules with stronger inhibition.","Han, Yanqiang; Wang, Zhilong; Ren, Jiahao; Wei, Zhiyun; Li, Jinjin",Brief Bioinform,486,32

Worldwide, more than 13,500 patients died, most often from acute respiratory distress syndrome. Because sudden death cases were rare, involving mostly young apparently healthy persons, influenza A/H1N1 (2009)‐related deaths may be misdiagnosed, which can raise medico‐legal issues. Case history: we report on an unexpected out‐of‐hospital death involving a young male with no past medical history and no vaccination. Fever was his only symptom. Laboratory tests: histology showed patchy necrotic foci with mononuclear inflammation in the lungs. The heart was histologically normal, but virological analyses using molecular biology on frozen myocardial samples showed high virus load. In conclusion, this case report shows that influenza A/H1N1 (2009) virus can be a cause of sudden cardiac death in the young and demonstrates the importance of quantitative virological analyses for the diagnosis of myocarditis.","Boulagnon, Camille; Leveque, Nicolas; Renois, Fanny; Andreoletti, Laurent; Fornes, Paul",J Forensic Sci,486,10

Analyses compared gambling behaviour as a function of pre-lockdown gambling status, measured by the Brief Problem Gambling Scale. In the whole sample, gambling participation decreased between pre- and during-lockdown. Both gambling frequency and weekly expenditure decreased during the first month of lockdown overall, but, the most engaged gamblers did not show a change in gambling behaviour, despite the decrease in opportunity and availability. Individuals whose financial circumstances were negatively affected by lockdown were more likely to perceive an increase in gambling than those whose financial circumstances were not negatively affected. Findings reflect short-term behaviour change; it will be crucial to examine, at future release of lockdown, if behaviour returns to pre-lockdown patterns, or whether new behavioural patterns persist.","Sharman, Steve; Roberts, Amanda; Bowden-Jones, Henrietta; Strang, John",Int J Ment Health Addict,486,16

DESIGN: A telephone and video assessment of IPC measures in SNFs at high risk or experiencing COVID-19 activity. PARTICIPANTS: SNFs in 14 New York counties, including New York City. INTERVENTION: A 3-component remote IPC assessment: (1) screening tool; (2) telephone IPC checklist; and (3) COVID-19 video IPC assessment (ie, “COVIDeo”). RESULTS: In total, 92 SNFs completed the IPC screening tool and checklist: 52 (57%) were conducted as part COVID-19 investigations, and 40 (43%) were proactive prevention-based assessments. Among the 40 proactive assessments, 14 (35%) identified suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases.

The IPC assessments took ∼1 hour each and reached an estimated 4 times as many SNFs as on-site visits in a similar time frame. CONCLUSIONS: Remote IPC assessments by telephone and video were timely and feasible methods of assessing the extent to which IPC interventions had been implemented in a vulnerable setting and to disseminate real-time recommendations. Remote assessments are now being implemented across New York State and in various healthcare facility types.

622049,622049,622049,ACE2: The Only Thing That Matters?,19.580145,12.060889,2020-07-15,"BACKGROUND: Accurate antibody tests are essential to monitor the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs) can deliver testing at scale. However, reported performance varies, and sensitivity analyses have generally been conducted on serum from hospitalised patients. For use in community testing, evaluation of finger-prick self-tests, in non-hospitalised individuals, is required. METHODS: Sensitivity analysis was conducted on 276 non-hospitalised participants. All had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription PCR and were ≥21 days from symptom onset. In phase I, we evaluated five LFIAs in clinic (with finger prick) and laboratory (with blood and sera) in comparison to (1) PCR-confirmed infection and (2) presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies on two ‘in-house’ ELISAs. Specificity analysis was performed on 500 prepandemic sera. In phase II, six additional LFIAs were assessed with serum. FINDINGS: 95% (95% CI 92.2% to 97.3%) of the infected cohort had detectable antibodies on at least one ELISA. LFIA sensitivity was variable, but significantly inferior to ELISA in 8 out of 11 assessed. Of LFIAs assessed in both clinic and laboratory, finger-prick self-test sensitivity varied from 21% to 92% versus PCR-confirmed cases and from 22% to 96% versus composite ELISA positives. Concordance between finger-prick and serum testing was at best moderate (kappa 0.56) and, at worst, slight (kappa 0.13). All LFIAs had high specificity (97.2%–99.8%). INTERPRETATION: LFIA sensitivity and sample concordance is variable, highlighting the importance of evaluations in setting of intended use. This rigorous approach to LFIA evaluation identified a test with high specificity (98.6% (95%CI 97.1% to 99.4%)), moderate sensitivity (84.4% with finger prick (95% CI 70.5% to 93.5%)) and moderate concordance, suitable for seroprevalence surveys.","Flower, Barnaby; Brown, Jonathan C; Simmons, Bryony; Moshe, Maya; Frise, Rebecca; Penn, Rebecca; Kugathasan, Ruthiran; Petersen, Claire; Daunt, Anna; Ashby, Deborah; Riley, Steven; Atchison, Christina Joanne; Taylor, Graham P; Satkunarajah, Sutha; Naar, Lenny; Klaber, Robert; Badhan, Anjna; Rosadas, Carolina; Khan, Maryam; Fernandez, Natalia; Sureda-Vives, Macià; Cheeseman, Hannah M; O'Hara, Jessica; Fontana, Gianluca; Pallett, Scott J C; Rayment, Michael; Jones, Rachael; Moore, Luke S P; McClure, Myra O; Cherepanov, Peter; Tedder, Richard; Ashrafian, Hutan; Shattock, Robin; Ward, Helen; Darzi, Ara; Elliot, Paul; Barclay, Wendy S; Cooke, Graham S",Thorax,486,19

These are associated with appetitive traits (food approach and avoidance) to some extent. However, no research has been conducted so far analyzing the association between food preferences and appetitive traits of adolescents. The aim of this study was to evaluate the associations between food preferences and appetitive traits in adolescents (aged 15–20 years) within the Polish Adolescents’ COVID-19 Experience (PLACE-19) Study population. The PLACE-19 Study was carried out in a population-based sample of 2448 secondary school students sampled across the country (random quota sampling). Food preferences (including the preference for vegetables, fruit, meat/fish, dairy, snacks, and starches) of the adolescents were assessed using the validated Food Preference Questionnaire (FPQ) while their appetitive traits (hunger, food responsiveness, emotional overeating, enjoyment of food, satiety responsiveness, emotional undereating, food fussiness, slowness in eating) were assessed using the validated Adult Eating Behavior Questionnaire (AEBQ). The k-means clustering was performed to identify the homogenous clusters of respondents based on their preferences, and linear regression was performed to determine the relationship between food preferences and appetitive traits with a model adjusted for sex and age. Based on their preferences, three homogenous clusters of respondents were defined: low-preferring respondents (low preference for all food categories), respondents preferring snacking foods (low preference for all food categories, except for fruit and snacks), and high-preferring respondents (high preference for all food categories). The low-preferring respondents showed the lowest values for all appetitive traits (p = 0.0008), as well as the lowest total score (p = 0.0001), except for food fussiness, for which they showed the highest value (p = 0.0008). All preference scores were positively associated with traits such as hunger, food responsiveness, enjoyment of food, and emotional under-eating, while negatively associated with food fussiness (all p < 0.05). The largest amount of variance was observed for preference for dairy (14.6%; R(2) = 0.146, p = 0.008) and snacks with respect to enjoyment of food (16.2%; R(2) = 0.162, p = 0.008), for vegetable with respect to food fussiness (22%; R(2) = 0.220, p = 0.008), and for meat/fish with respect to enjoyment of food (19.9%; R(2) = 0.199, p = 0.008) and food fussiness combined (19.1%; R(2) = 0.191, p = 0.008). These results support the association of food preferences with both food approach traits and food avoidance traits.","Guzek, Dominika; Skolmowska, Dominika; Głąbska, Dominika",Nutrients,486,15

To date, no national epidemiological study has examined the prevalence, associated factors, or sequelae of mental disorders in Qatar's general population. METHODS: The World Mental Health Qatar (WMHQ) is a national mental health needs assessment survey and is the first carried out in collaboration with the World Mental Health Survey initiative to assess the prevalence and burden of psychiatric illnesses among the full Arabic speaking population (nationals and non‐nationals) within the same country. RESULTS: Standard translation and harmonization procedures were used to develop the WMHQ instrument. A survey quality control system with standard performance indicators was developed to ensure interviewer adherence to standard practices. A pilot study was then carried out just prior to the COVID‐19 pandemic. Endorsement from public health authorities and sequential revision of the interview schedule led to full survey completion (as opposed to partial completion) and good overall response rate.

Instantaneously, however, all non‐essential research activities were halted when the pandemic started, forcing those involved in clinical research to re‐think their research strategy, including a shift to COVID‐19 research while endeavoring to maintain their pre‐existing agenda. Strategies to maintain the integrity of ongoing studies, including patient follow up, safety assessments and continuation of investigation products, have included a shift to telemedicine, remote safety laboratory monitoring, and shipping of investigational products to study subjects. As a re‐vamp of research is being planned, unique issues that face the research community include maintenance of infrastructure, funding, completion of studies in the pre‐determined time frame and the need to re‐program career path timelines.

The significance of having two additional compartments, viz., protective and hospital quarantine compartments, is then illustrated via numerical simulations. From the analysis and results, it is observed that, by properly selecting transfer functions to place exposed and infected individuals in protective and hospital quarantine compartments, respectively, and with apt governmental action, it is possible to contain the COVID-19 spread effectively.

Methods The associations of FPG and glucose fluctuation indexes with prognosis of COVID-19 in 2,642 patients were investigated by multivariate Cox regression analysis. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality; the secondary outcome was disease progression. The longitudinal changes of FPG over time were analyzed by the latent growth curve model in COVID-19 patients stratified by diabetes and severity of COVID-19. Results We found FPG as an independent prognostic factor of overall survival after adjustment for age, sex, diabetes and severity of COVID-19 at admission (HR: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.06-1.25, P=1.02×10-3). Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that the standard deviation of blood glucose (SDBG) and largest amplitude of glycemic excursions (LAGE) were also independent risk factors of COVID-19 progression (P=0.03 and 0.04, respectively). The growth trajectory of FPG over the first 3 days of hospitalization was steeper in patients with critical COVID-19 in comparison to moderate patients. Conclusions Hyperglycemia and glucose fluctuation were adverse prognostic factors of COVID-19 regardless of pre-existing diabetes. This stresses the importance of glycemic control in addition to other therapeutic management.","Xie, Weijia; Wu, Na; Wang, Bin; Xu, Yu; Zhang, Yao; Xiang, Ying; Zhang, Wenjing; Chen, Zheng; Yuan, Zhiquan; Li, Chengying; Jia, Xiaoyue; Shan, Yifan; Xu, Bin; Bai, Li; Zhong, Li; Li, Yafei",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,486,1

Given its unpredictable clinical course, risk assessment, and stratification for severity of COVID-19 are required. Apart from serving as admission criteria, prognostic factors might guide future therapeutic strategies. Aim: We aimed to compare clinical features and biological parameters between elderly (age ≥ 65 years) and non-elderly (age <65 years) patients with COVID-19 and new neurological symptoms/conditions. We also aimed to determine factors independently associated with all-cause in-hospital mortality. Methods: All consecutive patients with COVID-19 and new neurological symptoms/conditions admitted in our Neurology Department between April 1 and August 23, 2020 were enrolled in this observational retrospective cohort study. Patient characteristics such as demographic data, comorbidities, biological parameters, imaging findings and clinical course were recorded. All-cause in-hospital mortality was the main outcome, whereas COVID-19 severity, hospitalization duration and the levels of supplemental oxygen were the secondary outcomes. Results: One hundred forty-eight patients were included, out of which 54.1% were women. The average age was 59.84 ± 19.06 years and 47.3% were elderly, the majority having cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities. In the elderly group, the most frequent neurological symptoms/manifestations responsible for hospitalization were stroke symptoms followed by confusion, whereas in the non-elderly, headache prevailed. The final neurological diagnosis significantly varied between the two groups, with acute cerebrovascular events and acute confusional state in dementia most commonly encountered in the elderly (65.71 and 14.28%, respectively) and secondary headache attributed to SARS-CoV-2 infection often experienced by the non-elderly (38.46%). The elderly had statistically significant higher median values of white blood cell (8,060 vs. 6,090/μL) and neutrophil count (6,060 vs. 4,125/μL), C-reactive protein (29.2 vs. 5.72 mg/L), ferritin (482 vs. 187 mg/dL), fibrinogen (477 vs. 374 mg/dL), D-dimer (1.16 vs. 0.42), prothrombin time (151.15 vs. 13.8/s), aspartate transaminase (26.8 vs. 20.8 U/l), creatinine (0.96 vs. 0.77 mg/dL), and blood urea nitrogen level (51.1 vs. 27.65 mg/dL), as well as lower median value of hemoglobin (13.05 vs. 13.9 g/dL) and lymphocyte count (1,245 vs. 1,670/μL). Moreover, advanced age was significantly associated with more extensive lung involvement (25 vs. 10%) and higher fatality rate (40 vs. 9%). Overall, the mortality rate was 23.6%. Age as well as neutrophil count, C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and activated partial thromboplastin time levels were independently associated with mortality. Conclusions: Older age, higher neutrophil count, C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and activated partial thromboplastin time levels are independent predictors of mortality in COVID-19 patients with new neurological manifestations/conditions at admission.","Davidescu, Eugenia Irene; Odajiu, Irina; Tulbǎ, Delia; Sandu, Constantin Dragoş; Bunea, Teodora; Sandu, Georgiana; Mureşanu, Dafin Fior; Bǎlǎnescu, Paul; Popescu, Bogdan Ovidiu",Front Aging Neurosci,486,20

I find several important results. First, holding mobility fixed, temperature is found to have a negative and significant effect on COVID-19 cases from 1 to 8 weeks ahead and on deaths from 2 to 8 weeks ahead. Second, holding weather fixed, mobility is found to have a large positive effect on subsequent growth in COVID-19 cases and deaths. The impact on cases becomes significant 3 to 4 weeks ahead and continues through 8 to 10 weeks ahead. The impact on deaths becomes significant around 4 weeks ahead and persists for at least 10 weeks. Third, I find that the deleterious effects of mobility on COVID-19 outcomes are far greater when the local virus transmission rate is above one -- evidence supportive of public health policies aiming to reduce mobility specifically in places experiencing high transmission rates while relaxing restrictions elsewhere. Fourth, I find that the dynamic effects of mobility on cases are generally similar across counties, but the effects on deaths are higher for counties with older populations and, surprisingly, counties with lower black or hispanic population shares. Lastly, I find that while the marginal impact of mobility changes has been stable over recent weeks for cases, it has come down for deaths.","Wilson, D. J.",,486,16

We sought to examine the alignment of vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 risk in Massachusetts to inform public health response. Methods: We aggregated cumulative SARS-CoV-2 testing and vaccination data from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and the Boston Public Health Commission from January 29, 2020 to April 9, 2021. We used two approaches to assess vaccination equity: vaccination-to-infection risk (VIR) ratio and Lorenz curves. The VIR ratio was calculated for each community as the quotient of the number of fully vaccinated individuals divided by the cumulative number of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections. Lorenz curves were used to describe vaccination relative to COVID-19 burden. A multivariable Poisson model was used to assess predictors of VIR ratio. Results: A total of 607,120 (8.9%) SARS-CoV-2 infections were confirmed in Massachusetts residents and 1,485,266 (21.8%) residents were fully vaccinated. Communities with increased socioeconomic vulnerability had lower VIR ratios indicating less equitable vaccination relative to infection risk. In multivariable analysis, decreased vaccination relative to infection risk was independently associated with increasing socioeconomic vulnerability (aRR 0.82 per quartile increase, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.87) and with greater than 20% of the community identified as Black and/or Latinx (aRR 0.67, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.81). Improved community vaccine delivery was associated with higher community proportion of residents aged 65 or older (aRR 1.23 per 5% increase in proportion, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.31). Lorenz curves indicated considerable inequity (Gini 0.46 between communities). An estimated 330,000 full vaccination courses would need to be diverted to under-vaccinated communities to achieve equity. Conclusion: In conclusion, disparities in vaccine delivery highlight ongoing inequities in our approach to COVID-19 and imperil efforts to control the pandemic.","Dryden-Peterson, S.; Velasquez, G.
