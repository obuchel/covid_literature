595,The fertility quality of life (FertiQoL) tool: development and general psychometric properties(†),2011-06-10,"BACKGROUND: To develop the first international instrument to measure fertility quality of life (FertiQoL) in men and women experiencing fertility problems, to evaluate the preliminary psychometric properties of this new tool and to translate FertiQoL into multiple languages. METHOD: We conducted a survey, both online and in fertility clinics in USA, Australia/New Zealand, Canada and UK. A total of 1414 people with fertility problems participated. The main outcome measure was the FertiQoL tool. RESULTS: FertiQoL consists of 36 items that assess core (24 items) and treatment-related quality of life (QoL) (10 items) and overall life and physical health (2 items). Cronbach reliability statistics for the Core and Treatment FertiQoL (and subscales) were satisfactory and in the range of 0.72 and 0.92. Sensitivity analyses showed that FertiQoL detected expected relations between QoL and gender, parity and support-seeking. FertiQoL was translated into 20 languages by the same translation team with each translation verified by local bilingual fertility experts. CONCLUSIONS: FertiQoL is a reliable measure of the impact of fertility problems and its treatment on QoL. Future research should establish its use in cross-cultural research and clinical work.","Boivin, Jacky; Takefman, Janet; Braverman, Andrea",Hum Reprod,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3137391/,217
6408,Infection in Athletes,2012-10-23,"The use of negative contrast electronmicroscopy of stool suspension in the investigation of the aetiology of childhood gastroenteritis has led to the recognition of a number of candidate viral agents. There is convincing evidence that rotavirus is the single most important cause of community acquired gastroenteritis, and is responsible for some nosocomial outbreaks. The epidemiology of rotavirus acquisition, differential clinical susceptibilities of young and older infants, pathogenesis of disease, mechanisms of immunity and breast milk protection, and the role of different viral serotypes are aspects as yet poorly understood; and attempts to propagate human rotavirus in tissue culture have met with only limited success. Moreover, the aetiologically unaccountable one third of cases of infantile diarrhoea, and the association of enteritis with up to six other virus-like particles add to the complexity of the problem. This review considers the available data from human and animal studies, and based on the experience of ourselves and others comments on the present state of knowledge and trends in continuing research.","Spratt, H.

We have shown that the cytoskeletal passive stiffness of airway smooth muscle (ASM) can be regulated by intracellular signaling pathways, especially those associated with Rho kinase (ROCK). We have also shown that an oscillatory strain reduces the passive stiffness of ASM and its ability to generate force. Here, we investigated the combined effect of inhibiting the ASM contraction with β(2) agonist and decreasing the ASM cytoskeletal stiffness with ROCK inhibitor and/or force oscillation (FO) on the relaxation of contracted ASM. We hypothesize that the ASM relaxation can be synergistically enhanced by the combination of these interventions, because drug-induced softening of the cytoskeleton enhances the FO-induced relaxation and vice versa. Sheep tracheal strips were isotonically contracted to acetylcholine (3 × 10(−5) M). At the plateau of shortening, β(2) agonist salbutamol (10(−7) M), ROCK inhibitor H1152 (10(−7) M), and FO (square wave, 1 Hz, amplitude 6% maximal active force) were applied either alone or in combination. After adjusting for nonspecific time-dependent variation, relengthening by individual interventions with low-dose salbutamol or H1152, or small amplitude FO was not significantly different from zero. However, significant relengthening was observed in all combination treatments. The relengthening was greater than the mathematical sum of relengthening caused by individual treatments thereby demonstrating synergistic relaxation. The ASM stiffness did not change with salbutamol or H1152 treatments, but was lower with FO in combination with H1152. The results suggest that the mechanopharmacological treatment can be an effective therapy for asthma.","Wang, Lu; Chitano, Pasquale; Paré, Peter D.; Seow, Chun Y.",J Eng Sci Med Diagn Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7164492/,217

STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study of 81,110 infants <35 weeks gestational age and <1500 g birth weight discharged from 304 neonatal intensive care units from 2001–2016. RESULTS: The mean postmenstrual age at caffeine discontinuation ranged from 32 to 37 weeks among sites. Respiratory support at the time of discontinuation was common, but variable, with 0–57% of infants receiving positive airway pressure at caffeine discontinuation by site. Infants who discontinued caffeine within the last week of hospitalization had longer total duration of caffeine, but were discharged from the hospital at an earlier postmenstrual age. CONCLUSION: There was substantial variability among sites in the timing of caffeine discontinuation before discharge and respiratory support at the time of caffeine discontinuation.","Ji, Dabin; Smith, P.

11558,Trauma Does not Quarantine: Violence During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-04-29,"Mechanisms regulating the turnover of synaptic vesicle (SV) proteins are not well understood. They are thought to require poly-ubiquitination and degradation through proteasome, endo-lysosomal or autophagy-related pathways. Bassoon was shown to negatively regulate presynaptic autophagy in part by scaffolding Atg5. Here, we show that increased autophagy in Bassoon knockout neurons depends on poly-ubiquitination and that the loss of Bassoon leads to elevated levels of ubiquitinated synaptic proteins per se. Our data show that Bassoon knockout neurons have a smaller SV pool size and a higher turnover rate as indicated by a younger pool of SV2. The E3 ligase Parkin is required for increased autophagy in Bassoon-deficient neurons as the knockdown of Parkin normalized autophagy and SV protein levels and rescued impaired SV recycling. These data indicate that Bassoon is a key regulator of SV proteostasis and that Parkin is a key E3 ligase in the autophagy-mediated clearance of SV proteins.","Hoffmann-Conaway, Sheila; Brockmann, Marisa M; Schneider, Katharina; Annamneedi, Anil; Rahman, Kazi Atikur; Bruns, Christine; Textoris-Taube, Kathrin; Trimbuch, Thorsten; Smalla, Karl-Heinz; Rosenmund, Christian; Gundelfinger, Eckart D; Garner, Craig Curtis; Montenegro-Venegas, Carolina",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7224700/,217
11796,"Scope, quality, and inclusivity of clinical guidelines produced early in the covid-19 pandemic: rapid review",2020-06-12,"BACKGROUND: The advent of immune checkpoint blockade antibodies has demonstrated that effective mobilization of T cell responses can cause tumor regression of metastatic cancers, although these responses are heterogeneous and restricted to certain histologic types of cancer. To enhance these responses, there has been renewed emphasis in developing effective cancer-specific vaccines to stimulate and direct T cell immunity to important oncologic targets, such as the oncogene human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), expressed in ~20% of breast cancers (BCs). METHODS: In our study, we explored the use of alternative antigen trafficking through use of a lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP) domain to enhance vaccine efficacy against HER2 and other model antigens in both in vitro and in vivo studies. RESULTS: We found that inclusion of this domain in plasmid vaccines effectively trafficked antigens to endolysosomal compartments, resulting in enhanced major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II presentation. Additionally, this augmented the expansion/activation of antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and also led to elevated levels of antigen-specific polyfunctional CD8+ T cells. Significantly, vaccination with HER2-LAMP produced tumor regression in ~30% of vaccinated mice with established tumors in an endogenous model of metastatic HER2+ BC, compared with 0% of HER2-WT vaccinated mice. This therapeutic benefit is associated with enhanced tumor infiltration of activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate the potential of using LAMP-based endolysosomal trafficking as a means to augment the generation of polyfunctional, antigen-specific T cells in order to improve antitumor therapeutic responses using cancer antigen vaccines.","Chen, Alan Chen; Xu, Renhuan; Wang, Tao; Wei, Junping; Yang, Xiao-Yi; Liu, Cong-Xiao; Lei, Gangjun; Lyerly, Herbert Kim; Heiland, Teri; Hartman, Zachary Conrad",J Immunother Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7295440/,217

12259,On the Development of Implicit and Control Processes in Relation to Substance Use in Adolescence,2015-04-08,"Gambling disorder recently was reclassified under the category “substance-related and addictive disorders.” With regard to the diagnostic criteria, it overlaps a great deal with substance use disorder, i.e., loss of control, craving/withdrawal, and neglect of other areas of life. However, the gambling disorder symptom “chasing one’s losses” is the only criterion absent from substance use disorder. Therefore, special forms of reward (i.e., gain/loss) processing, such as the processing of loss avoidance and loss aversion, have just recently attracted attention among gambling disorder researchers. Because gambling disorder might be considered an addiction in its “pure” form, i.e., without the influence of a drug of abuse, investigating brain volume changes in people with this behavioral addiction is an important task for neuroimaging researchers in exploring the neural signatures of addiction. Because the brain is a complex network, investigation of alterations in functional connectivity has gained interest among gambling disorder researchers in order to get a more complete picture of functional brain changes in people with gambling disorder. However, only a few studies on brain structure and functional connectivity in gambling disorder have been performed so far. This review focuses on brain imaging studies of reward and loss processing, with an emphasis on loss avoidance and aversion as well as brain volume and functional connectivity in gambling disorder.","Quester, Saskia; Romanczuk-Seiferth, Nina",Curr Addict Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4529460/,217
12619,Estimating the Effect of Depression on HIV Transmission Risk Behaviors Among People Who Inject Drugs in Vietnam: A Causal Approach,2020-08-24,"Influenza A viruses are single-stranded RNA viruses capable of evolving rapidly to adapt to environmental conditions. Examples include the establishment of a virus in a novel host or an adaptation to increasing immunity within the host population due to prior infection or vaccination against a circulating strain. Knowledge of the viral protein regions under positive selection is therefore crucial for surveillance. We have developed a method for detecting positively selected patches of sites on the surface of viral proteins, which we assume to be relevant for adaptive evolution. We measure positive selection based on dN/dS ratios of genetic changes inferred by considering the phylogenetic structure of the data and suggest a graph-cut algorithm to identify such regions. Our algorithm searches for dense and spatially distinct clusters of sites under positive selection on the protein surface. For the hemagglutinin protein of human influenza A viruses of the subtypes H3N2 and H1N1, our predicted sites significantly overlap with known antigenic and receptor-binding sites. From the structure and sequence data of the 2009 swine-origin influenza A/H1N1 hemagglutinin and PB2 protein, we identified regions that provide evidence of evolution under positive selection since introduction of the virus into the human population. The changes in PB2 overlap with sites reported to be associated with mammalian adaptation of the influenza A virus. Application of our technique to the protein structures of viruses of yet unknown adaptive behavior could identify further candidate regions that are important for host–virus interaction.","Tusche, Christina; Steinbrück, Lars; McHardy, Alice C.",Mol Biol Evol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3408068/,217

Many biological properties of cfNAs can be informative to gain deeper insights into the function of the organism, such as their different types (DNA, RNAs) and subtypes (gDNA, mtDNA, bacterial DNA, miRNAs, etc.), forms (naked or vesicle bound NAs), fragmentation profiles, sequence composition, epigenetic modifications, and many others. On the other hand, the workflows of their analyzes comprise many important steps, from sample collection, storage and transportation, through extraction and laboratory analysis, up to bioinformatic analyzes and statistical evaluations, where each of these steps has the potential to affect the outcome and informational value of the performed analyzes. There are, however, no universal or standard protocols on how to exactly proceed when analyzing different cfNAs for different applications, at least according to our best knowledge.

15738,Community assets and multimorbidity: A qualitative scoping study,2021-02-24,"BACKGROUND: Outdated gender, sex, and sexual orientation (GSSO) information practices in health care contribute to health inequities for sexual and gender minorities (SGMs). Governments, statistics agencies, and health care organizations are developing and implementing modernized practices that support health equity for SGMs. Extending our work, we conducted a rapid review of grey literature to explore information practices that support quality health care for SGMs. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this rapid review of grey literature was to elucidate modern GSSO information practices from leading agencies for adaptation, adoption, and application by health care providers and organizations seeking to modernize outdated GSSO information practices that contribute to health inequities among SGMs. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE and Google from 2015 to 2020 with terms related to gender, sex, sexual orientation, and electronic health/medical records for English-language grey literature resources including government and nongovernment organization publications, whitepapers, data standards, toolkits, health care organization and health quality practice and policy guides, conference proceedings, unpublished academic work, and statistical papers. Peer-reviewed journal articles were excluded, as were resources irrelevant to information practices. We also screened the reference sections of included articles for additional resources, and canvassed a working group of international topic experts for additional relevant resources. Duplicates were eliminated. ATLAS.ti was used to support analysis. Themes and codes were developed through an iterative process of writing and discussion with the research team. RESULTS: Twenty-six grey literature resources met the inclusion criteria. The overarching themes that emerged from the literature were the interrelated behaviors, attitudes, and policies that constitute SGM cultural competence as follows: shared language with unambiguous definitions of GSSO concepts; welcoming and inclusive care environments and affirming practices to reduce barriers to access; health care policy that supports competent health care; and adoption of modernized GSSO information practices and electronic health record design requirements that address invisibility in health data. CONCLUSIONS: Health equity for SGMs requires systemic change. Binary representation of sex and gender in electronic health records (EHRs) obfuscates natural and cultural diversity and, in the context of health care, places SGM patients at risk of clinical harm because it leads to clinical assumptions. Agencies and agents in health care need to be equipped with the knowledge and tools needed to cultivate modern attitudes, policies, and practices that enable health equity for SGMs. Adopting small but important changes in the language and terminology used in technical and social health care systems is essential for institutionalizing SGM competency. Modern GSSO information practices depend on and reinforce SGM competency in health care.","Davison, Kelly; Queen, Roz; Lau, Francis; Antonio, Marcy",JMIR Med Inform,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7906831/,217
17809,Changing Knowledge and Attitudes Towards HIV Treatment-as-Prevention and “Undetectable = Untransmittable”: A Systematic Review,2021-05-25,"The microbiome, by virtue of its interactions with the host, is implicated in various host functions including its influence on nutrition and homeostasis. Many chronic diseases such as diabetes, cancer, inflammatory bowel diseases are characterized by a disruption of microbial communities in at least one biological niche/organ system. Various molecular mechanisms between microbial and host components such as proteins, RNAs, metabolites have recently been identified, thus filling many gaps in our understanding of how the microbiome modulates host processes. Concurrently, high-throughput technologies have enabled the profiling of heterogeneous datasets capturing community level changes in the microbiome as well as the host responses. However, due to limitations in parallel sampling and analytical procedures, big gaps still exist in terms of how the microbiome mechanistically influences host functions at a system and community level. In the past decade, computational biology and machine learning methodologies have been developed with the aim of filling the existing gaps. Due to the agnostic nature of the tools, they have been applied in diverse disease contexts to analyze and infer the interactions between the microbiome and host molecular components. Some of these approaches allow the identification and analysis of affected downstream host processes. Most of the tools statistically or mechanistically integrate different types of -omic and meta -omic datasets followed by functional/biological interpretation. In this review, we provide an overview of the landscape of computational approaches for investigating mechanistic interactions between individual microbes/microbiome and the host and the opportunities for basic and clinical research. These could include but are not limited to the development of activity- and mechanism-based biomarkers, uncovering mechanisms for therapeutic interventions and generating integrated signatures to stratify patients.","Sudhakar, Padhmanand; Machiels, Kathleen; Verstockt, Bram; Korcsmaros, Tamas; Vermeire, Séverine",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8148342/,217

However, the last such prioritization study was conducted more than a decade ago and used International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes. OBJECTIVES: To identify conditions that should be prioritized for comparative effectiveness research based on prevalence, cost, and variation in cost of hospitalizations using contemporary data at US children’s hospitals. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study of children with hospital encounters used data from the Pediatric Health Information System database. Children younger than 18 years with inpatient hospital encounters at 45 tertiary care US children’s hospitals between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2019, were included. Data were analyzed from March 2020 to April 2021. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The condition-specific prevalence and total standardized cost, the corresponding prevalence and cost ranks, and the variation in standardized cost per encounter across hospitals were analyzed. The variation in cost was assessed using the number of outlier hospitals and intraclass correlation coefficient. RESULTS: There were 2 882 490 inpatient hospital encounters (median [interquartile range] age, 4 [1-12] years; 1 554 024 [53.9%] boys) included. Among the 50 most prevalent and 50 most costly conditions (total, 74 conditions), 49 (66.2%) were medical, 15 (20.3%) were surgical, and 10 (13.5%) were medical/surgical. The top 10 conditions by cost accounted for $12.4 billion of $33.4 billion total costs (37.4%) and 592 815 encounters (33.8% of all encounters). Of 74 conditions, 4 conditions had an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.30 or higher (ie, major depressive disorder: ICC, 0.49; type 1 diabetes with complications: ICC, 0.36; diabetic ketoacidosis: ICC, 0.33; acute appendicitis without peritonitis: ICC, 0.30), and 9 conditions had an ICC higher than 0.20 (scoliosis: ICC, 0.27; hypertrophy of tonsils and adenoids: ICC, 0.26; supracondylar fracture of humerus: ICC, 0.25; cleft lip and palate: ICC, 0.24; acute appendicitis with peritonitis: ICC, 0.21). Examples of conditions high in prevalence, cost, and variation in cost included major depressive disorder (cost rank, 19; prevalence rank, 10; ICC, 0.49), scoliosis (cost rank, 6; prevalence rank, 38; ICC, 0.27), acute appendicitis with peritonitis (cost rank, 13; prevalence rank, 11; ICC, 0.21), asthma (cost rank, 10; prevalence rank, 2; ICC, 0.17), and dehydration (cost rank, 24; prevalence rank, 8; ICC, 0.18). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study found that major depressive disorder, scoliosis, acute appendicitis with peritonitis, asthma, and dehydration were high in prevalence, costs, and variation in cost. These results could help identify where future comparative effectiveness research in hospital pediatrics should be targeted to improve the care and outcomes of hospitalized children.","Gill, Peter J.; Anwar, Mohammed Rashidul; Thavam, Thaksha; Hall, Matt; Rodean, Jonathan; Kaiser, Sunitha V.; Srivastava, Rajendu; Keren, Ron; Mahant, Sanjay",JAMA Netw Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8314139/,217

A rapid increase in healthcare expenditure is a trend in major developing and developed countries; however, healthcare expenditure widely varies among most Asian countries. Asian countries contribute a significant amount of output to economic development worldwide. The statistical test power is more efficient for the pooling of national data than individual national data because of the economic value and trade integration of regional nations. This is the first study that applies the quantile-on-quantile approach to investigate the influence of the quantiles of healthcare on the quantiles of the economy's growth for pooling forty countries in the Asian region. As the quantile of healthcare expenditure increases in the countries, the impact of healthcare expenditure on the economy's growth does not guarantee an increase. The positive and negative effects of healthcare expenditure on developing the economic relationship will repeatedly occur when the quantiles of the economy's growth increase in the countries. One implication is that the governments should account for problems such as corruption, bureaucracy, underinvestment, and inefficiency in health-related resource utilization.","Wu, Cheng-Feng; Chang, Tsangyao; Wang, Chien-Ming; Wu, Tsung-Pao; Lin, Meng-Chen; Huang, Shian-Chang",Front Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8438143/,217

Asymptomatic carriers may host the parasite for years, without knowing they are infected. The aim of this study is to assess prevalence of Chagas disease and evaluate the participants’ level of knowledge between Latin American migrants attending a community-based screening campaign. METHODS: Three community-based campaigns were performed in Alicante (Spain) in 2016, 2017 and 2018, including educational chats and blood tests for Trypanosoma cruzi serology. Participants completed a questionnaire assessing knowledge about the mechanisms of transmission, disease presentation, diagnosis, and treatment. People seropositive for T. cruzi underwent diagnostic confirmation by two different tests. Results were analyzed by multivariable logistic regression and expressed as adjusted odds ratios (aORs), adjusting for age, sex, and time in Spain. RESULTS: A total of 596 participants were included in the study; 17% were aged under 18 years. Prevalence in adults was 11% [54/496; 95% confidence interval (CI): 8.3–14.5%] versus 0% among children. All but one case were in Bolivians. Diagnosis was independently associated with having been born in Bolivia (aOR: 102, 95% CI: 13–781) and a primary school-level education (aOR: 2.40, 95% CI: 1.14–5.06). Of 54 people diagnosed with Chagas disease (most of whom were asymptomatic), 42 (77.7%) returned to the clinic at least once, and 24 (44.4%) received treatment. Multivariable analysis showed that coming from Argentina (aOR: 13, 95% CI: 1.61–1188) or Bolivia (aOR: 1.90, 95% CI: 1.19–3.39) and having received information about Chagas disease in Spain (aOR: 4.63, 95% CI: 2.54–8.97) were associated with a good level of knowledge on the disease. Having primary level studies (aOR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.34–0.98) and coming from Ecuador (aOR: 4.63, 95% CI: 2.52–847) were independently associated with a lower level of knowledge. CONCLUSIONS: Community-based interventions are a good strategy for diagnosing neglected diseases such as Chagas disease in non-endemic countries and for identifying and treating infected, asymptomatic individuals.

24565,Terror-Related Trauma,2015-10-28,"Plus-stranded RNA viruses, the largest group among eukaryotic viruses, are capable of reprogramming host cells by subverting host proteins and membranes, by co-opting and modulating protein and ribonucleoprotein complexes, and by altering cellular pathways during infection. To achieve robust replication, plus-stranded RNA viruses interact with numerous cellular molecules via protein–protein, RNA–protein, and protein–lipid interactions using molecular mimicry and other means. These interactions lead to the transformation of the host cells into viral “factories"" that can produce 10,000–1,000,000 progeny RNAs per infected cell. This chapter presents the progress that was made largely in the last 15 years in understanding virus–host interactions during RNA virus replication. The most commonly employed approaches to identify host factors that affect plus-stranded RNA virus replication are described. In addition, we discuss many of the identified host factors and their proposed roles in RNA virus replication. Altogether, host factors are key determinants of the host range of a given virus and affect virus pathology, host–virus interactions, as well as virus evolution. Studies on host factors also contribute insights into their normal cellular functions, thus promoting understanding of the basic biology of the host cell. The knowledge obtained in this fast-progressing area will likely stimulate the development of new antiviral methods as well as novel strategies that could make plus-stranded RNA viruses useful in bio- and nanotechnology.","Nagy, Peter D.; Pogany, Judit",Viral Genome Replication,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120932/,217

32454,Effects of Covid-19 Pandemic on Neurological Surgery Care and Education; Our Experience from Iran,2020-05-13,"User Identity Linkage (UIL) is the problem of matching user identities across multiple online social networks (OSNs) which belong to the same person. The solutions to UIL problem facilitate cross-platform research on OSN users and enable many useful applications such as user profiling and recommendation. As the UIL labeled data are often lacking and costly to obtain, learning user embeddings for matching user identities using an unsupervised approach is therefore highly desired. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised UIL framework for enhancing existing user embedding-based UIL methods. Our proposed framework incorporates two key ideas, user-discriminative features and retrofitting embedding. The user-discriminative features enable us to differentiate a specific user identity from other users in its OSN. From the user-discriminative features, we derive pairs of similar user identities across OSNs for retrofitting the base user embeddings of existing UIL methods. Through extensive experiments on three real-world OSN datasets, we show that our framework can leverage user-discriminative features to improve the accuracy of different user embedding-based UIL methods significantly. The quantum of improvement can also be surprisingly good even for existing UIL methods with very poor matching accuracy.

32707,COVID-19: contact and gesture monitoring using PROUD Technology,2020-05-12,"The rapid advancement of electronic devices and fabrication technologies has further promoted the field of wearables and smart textiles. However, most of the current efforts in textile electronics focus on a single modality and cover a small area. Here, we have developed a tailored, electronic textile conformable suit (E-TeCS) to perform large-scale, multimodal physiological (temperature, heart rate, and respiration) sensing in vivo. This platform can be customized for various forms, sizes and functions using standard, accessible and high-throughput textile manufacturing and garment patterning techniques. Similar to a compression shirt, the soft and stretchable nature of the tailored E-TeCS allows intimate contact between electronics and the skin with a pressure value of around ~25 mmHg, allowing for physical comfort and improved precision of sensor readings on skin. The E-TeCS can detect skin temperature with an accuracy of 0.1 °C and a precision of 0.01 °C, as well as heart rate and respiration with a precision of 0.0012 m/s(2) through mechano-acoustic inertial sensing. The knit textile electronics can be stretched up to 30% under 1000 cycles of stretching without significant degradation in mechanical and electrical performance. Experimental and theoretical investigations are conducted for each sensor modality along with performing the robustness of sensor-interconnects, washability, and breathability of the suit. Collective results suggest that our E-TeCS can simultaneously and wirelessly monitor 30 skin temperature nodes across the human body over an area of 1500 cm(2), during seismocardiac events and respiration, as well as physical activity through inertial dynamics.","Wicaksono, Irmandy; Tucker, Carson I.; Sun, Tao; Guerrero, Cesar A.; Liu, Clare; Woo, Wesley M.; Pence, Eric J.; Dagdeviren, Canan",npj Flex Electron,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222957/,217

Since its latest stable version, the SMT-LIB standard defines a theory of algebraic datatypes, which is currently supported by several mainstream SMT solvers. In this paper, we study this particular theory of datatypes and prove that it is strongly polite, showing also how it can be combined with other arbitrary disjoint theories using polite combination. Our results cover both inductive and finite datatypes, as well as their union. The combination method uses a new, simple, and natural notion of additivity, that enables deducing strong politeness from (weak) politeness.","Sheng, Ying; Zohar, Yoni; Ringeissen, Christophe; Lange, Jane; Fontaine, Pascal; Barrett, Clark",Automated Reasoning,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7324139/,217

We explored the effects of administering dexmedetomidine on the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin, and thus on inflammation, in patients with sepsis enrolled in a randomized clinical trial. METHODS: The DESIRE trial was a multicenter randomized clinical trial in which adult patients with sepsis were sedated with (DEX group) or without (non-DEX group) dexmedetomidine while on mechanical ventilators. As a prespecified sub-analysis, we compared CRP and procalcitonin levels during the first 14 days of treatment between the two groups. The 14-day mortality rate, albumin level, and the number of patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) were also assessed. We used generalized linear models to estimate the differences in these outcomes between groups. We also used the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate the 14-day mortality rate and the log-rank test to assess between-group differences. RESULTS: Our study comprised 201 patients: 100 in the DEX group and 101 in the non-DEX group. CRP and procalcitonin levels were lower in the DEX vs. non-DEX group during the 14-day treatment period [CRP—range, 5.6–20.3 vs. 8.3–21.1 mg/dL (P = 0.03); procalcitonin—range, 1.2–37.4 vs. 1.7–52.9 ng/mL (P = 0.04)]. Albumin levels were higher in the DEX group (range, 2.3–2.6 g/dL) than in the non-DEX group (range, 2.1–2.7 g/dL; P = 0.01). The percentage of patients with DIC did not significantly differ between the groups (range, 21–59% and 17–56% for the DEX and non-DEX groups, respectively; P = 0.49). The 14-day mortality rates in the DEX and non-DEX groups were 13 and 21%, respectively (P = 0.16).

Since many systems are too large to be studied numerically, DFTs dependability is often analysed using Monte Carlo simulation. A bottleneck here is that many simulation samples are required in the case of rare events, e.g. in highly reliable systems where components fail seldomly. Rare event simulation (RES) provides techniques to reduce the number of samples in the case of rare events. We present a RES technique based on importance splitting, to study failures in highly reliable DFTs. Whereas RES usually requires meta-information from an expert, our method is fully automatic: By cleverly exploiting the fault tree structure we extract the so-called importance function. We handle DFTs with Markovian and non-Markovian failure and repair distributions—for which no numerical methods exist—and show the efficiency of our approach on several case studies.","Budde, Carlos E.; Biagi, Marco; Monti, Raúl E.; D’Argenio, Pedro R.; Stoelinga, Mariëlle",Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7439750/,217
38547,How one large outpatient practice moved to home‐based telemedicine services,2020-08-19,"BACKGROUND: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a relatively rare and life-threatening disorder. Early mortality remains significantly high among patients with HLH. Our aim was to investigate clinical features and risk factors associated with 7-day and 30-day mortality among pediatric HLH patients. We retrospectively collected medical records of patients with discharge diagnosis of HLH between August 2014 and October 2018 from a tertiary children’s hospital in China. The main outcome measures were the 7-day and 30-day outcome after hospital admission. The associations between symptoms, concomitant diagnoses, laboratory test results, and the risk of 7-day and 30-day mortality were examined. RESULTS: Among 160 pediatric HLH patients, 18 (11.3%) patients were deceased within 7 days after admission, and 46 (28.8%) patients were deceased within 30 days. The identified strong risk factors (OR > 10 and p < 0.05) for 30-day mortality were myocardial damage, severe pneumonia, respiratory failure, coagulopathy, gastrointestinal disorder, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Factors strongly associated with 7-day mortality were sepsis, myocardial damage, shock, and respiratory failure. All patients deceased within 7 days developed hepatic dysfunction, coagulopathy, and MODS. CONCLUSIONS: The identified risk factors could help to stratify patients with high risk of early death, and need to be considered in the development of treatment protocols. As early mortality of HLH remains high, studies are needed to investigate how to initiate adequate HLH-directed treatment strategies for patients at higher risk of early death.","Li, Xun; Yan, Haipeng; Zhang, Xinping; Huang, Jiaotian; Xiang, Shi-Ting; Yao, Zhenya; Zang, Ping; Zhu, Desheng; Xiao, Zhenghui; Lu, Xiulan",Orphanet J Rare Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7456759/,217

To determine whether bovine surfactant given in NARDS can improve oxygenation and survival rate, we conducted a multicenter, randomized trial between January 2018 and June 2019, and we compared Calsurf treatment to controls in neonates with pneumonia accompanied by NARDS. Neonates who met the Montreux criteria definition of NARDS were included, and those with congenital heart and lung malformations were excluded. Primary outcomes were oxygenation index (OI) after Calsurf administration, and secondary outcomes were mortality, and duration of ventilator and oxygen between the two groups, and also other morbidities. Cumulatively, 328 neonates were recruited and analyzed, 162 in the control group, and 166 in the Calsurf group. The results shows that OI in the Calsurf group were significantly lower than that in the control group at 4 h (7.2 ± 2.7 and 11.4 ± 9.1, P = 0.001); similarly, OI in the Calsurf group were significantly lower than in the control group at 12 h ( 7.5 ± 3.1 and 11.2 ± 9.2, P = 0.001). Mortality and duration of ventilator support or oxygen use between the two groups were not significantly different. Conclusion: Calsurf acutely improved OI immediately after administration in pneumonia-induced NARDS; although, we observed no significant decrease in mortality, duration of ventilator or oxygen, or major morbidity.

Throughout, UK government ministers emphasised their reliance on science and expertise to make the right choices at the right time, while their critics argued that ministers ignored key evidence and acted too little too late. Lessons from this debate should have a profound effect on future action, but only if based on a systematic analysis of policymaking as the problem emerged in real time. We should not confuse hindsight with foresight. To that end, I combine insights from policy analysis guides, policy theories, and critical policy analysis to frame this debate. The pandemic exposes the need to act despite high ambiguity and uncertainty and low government control, using trial-and-error strategies to adapt to new manifestations of the problem, and producing unequal consequences for social groups. Lessons will only have value if we incorporate these policymaking limitations and unequal socioeconomic effects and ask the right questions when holding the UK government to account.","Cairney, Paul",Br Polit,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7603640/,217

This study explored how forensic patients with schizophrenia process spoken emotion by: (a) identifying emotions expressed in prosodic and semantic content separately, (b) selectively attending to one speech channel while ignoring the other, and (c) integrating the prosodic and the semantic channels, compared to non-clinical controls. Twenty-one forensic patients with schizophrenia and 21 matched controls listened to sentences conveying four emotions (anger, happiness, sadness, and neutrality) presented in semantic or prosodic channels, in different combinations. They were asked to rate how much they agreed that the sentences conveyed a predefined emotion, focusing on one channel or on the sentence as a whole. Forensic patients with schizophrenia performed with intact identification and integration of spoken emotions, but their ratings indicated reduced discrimination, larger failures of selective attention, and under-ratings of negative emotions, compared to controls. This finding doesn't support previous reports of an inclination to interpret social situations in a negative way among individuals with schizophrenia. Finally, current results may guide rehabilitation approaches matched to the pattern of auditory emotional processing presented by forensic patients with schizophrenia, improving social interactions and quality of life.","Leshem, Rotem; Icht, Michal; Bentzur, Roni; Ben-David, Boaz M.",Front Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7691229/,217

The identification of locations with potential and unknown spread of ZIKV is a key yet understudied component for outbreak preparedness. Here, we aim to identify locations at a high risk of cryptic ZIKV spread during 2015–2016 to further the understanding of the global ZIKV epidemiology, which is critical for the mitigation of the risk of future epidemics. METHODS: We developed an importation simulation model to estimate the weekly number of ZIKV infections imported in each susceptible spatial unit (i.e. location that did not report any autochthonous Zika cases during 2015–2016), integrating epidemiological, demographic, and travel data as model inputs. Thereafter, a global risk model was applied to estimate the weekly ZIKV transmissibility during 2015–2016 for each location. Finally, we assessed the risk of onward ZIKV spread following importation in each susceptible spatial unit to identify locations with a high potential for cryptic ZIKV spread during 2015–2016. RESULTS: We have found 24 susceptible spatial units that were likely to have experienced cryptic ZIKV spread during 2015–2016, of which 10 continue to have a high risk estimate within a highly conservative scenario, namely, Luanda in Angola, Banten in Indonesia, Maharashtra in India, Lagos in Nigeria, Taiwan and Guangdong in China, Dakar in Senegal, Maputo in Mozambique, Kinshasa in Congo DRC, and Pool in Congo. Notably, among the 24 susceptible spatial units identified, some have reported their first ZIKV outbreaks since 2017, thus adding to the credibility of our results (derived using 2015–2016 data only). CONCLUSION: Our study has provided valuable insights into the potentially high-risk locations for cryptic ZIKV circulation during the 2015–2016 pandemic and has also laid a foundation for future studies that attempt to further narrow this key knowledge gap. Our modelling framework can be adapted to identify areas with likely unknown spread of other emerging vector-borne diseases, which has important implications for public health readiness especially in resource-limited settings.","Sun, Haoyang; Dickens, Borame L.; Jit, Mark; Cook, Alex R.; Carrasco, L.

Reading is part of communication applying the correct (de) coding of written information. An important factor in understanding the information is the set of knowledge and skills elements of a sociological, psychological, ethical and media nature. Language as a tool for the transmission of information and human thinking concurrently reflects the values of the individual and society. This study aims to characterise the level of reading strategies of secondary vocational school students in the Moravian-Silesian Region in connection with the findings of an international survey of reading literacy of 15-year-old students (PISA 2018), which pointed out that Czech students (especially boys) achieve a below-average level in analysed reading strategies. Fifteen-year-old pupils of the region are among the worst regional groups in the Czech Republic. The second goal of the research was to find out which factors influence the development of pupils’ reading literacy, during and after working with the (e)text, reading comprehension and the effectiveness of reading comfort. An analysis of the responses of 488 students of three secondary schools of engineering showed that students who read for knowledge prefer a particular topic when reading and that students who ask questions while reading or after reading a text also look for new information to discover a context of information. Another important finding was that reading comfort and reading context are in mutual interaction. To develop an individual’s language culture, it is significant to support reading not only as a part of school duties but as an integral part of everyday life.","Vicherková, Dana; Malach, Josef",Educating Engineers for Future Industrial Revolutions,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972133/,217

The ‘anthropause’, a period of unusually reduced human activity and mobility due to COVID‐19 restrictions, has serendipitously opened up unique opportunities for research on how human activities impact the environment. 2. In the field of health, COVID‐19 research has led to concerns about the quality of research papers and the underlying research and publication processes due to accelerated peer review and publication schedules, increases in pre‐prints and retractions. 3. In the field of environmental science, framing the pandemic and associated global lockdowns as an unplanned global human confinement experiment with urgency should raise the same concerns about the rigorousness and integrity of the scientific process. Furthermore, the recognition of an ‘infodemic’, an unprecedented explosion of research, risks research waste and duplication of effort, although how information is used is as important as the quality of evidence. This highlights the need for an evidence base that is easy to find and use – that is discoverable, curated, synthesizable, synthesized. 4. We put forward a list of 10 key principles to support the establishment of a reproducible, replicable, robust, rigorous, timely and synthesizable COVID‐19 environmental evidence base that avoids research waste and is resilient to the pressures to publish urgently. These principles focus on engaging relevant actors (e.g. local communities, rightsholders) in research design and production, statistical power, collaborations, evidence synthesis, research registries and protocols, open science and transparency, data hygiene (cleanliness) and integrity, peer review transparency, standardized keywords and controlled vocabularies.","Kadykalo, Andrew N.; Haddaway, Neal R.; Rytwinski, Trina; Cooke, Steven J.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7994966/,217

Several hypotheses have been raised to understand the intersections between melatonin and depression, in which changes in rest-activity and sleep patterns are prominent. This review describes key experimental and clinical evidence that link melatonin with the etiopathology and symptomatology of depressive states, its role in the follow up of therapeutic response to antidepressants, as well as the clinical evidence of melatonin as MDD treatment. Melatonin, as an internal temporal cue contributing to circadian organization and best studied in the context of circadian misalignment, is also implicated in neuroplasticity. The monoaminergic systems that underly MDD and melatonin production overlap. In addition, the urinary metabolite 6-sulfatoxymelatonin (aMT6) has been proposed as biomarker for antidepressant responders, by revealing whether the blockage of noradrenaline uptake has taken place within 24 h from the first antidepressant dose. Even though animal models show benefits from melatonin supplementation on depressive-like behavior, clinical evidence is inconsistent vis-à-vis prophylactic or therapeutic benefits of melatonin or melatonin agonists in depression. We argue that the study of melatonin in MDD or other psychiatric disorders must take into account the specificities of melatonin as an integrating molecule, inextricably linked to entrainment, metabolism, immunity, neurotransmission, and cell homeostasis.","Tonon, André C.; Pilz, Luísa K.; Markus, Regina P.; Hidalgo, Maria Paz; Elisabetsky, Elaine",Front Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8060443/,217

The assessment of CI is based on neuropsychological tests and accurate anamnesis, involving the patients and caregivers (CG). This study aimed to assess the complex interplay between self-perception of CI, objective CI and the brain atrophy of MS patients, also exploring the possible differences with CI evaluated by caregivers. Methods: Relapsing pwMS were enrolled in this study. Subjects underwent neuropsychological examination using the Brief Cognitive Assessment for Multiple Sclerosis (BICAMS) and evaluation of self-reported cognitive status using the patient-version of the Multiple Sclerosis Neuropsychological Questionnaire (p-MSNQ). Depression and anxiety were also evaluated using the Back Depression Inventory-version II (BDI-II) and Zung Anxiety Scale. Brain MRI images were acquired and brain volumes estimated. For each patient that was enrolled, we spoke to a caregiver and collected their perception of the patient's CI using the MSNQ- Caregiver version. Results: Ninety-five MS subjects with their caregivers were enrolled. CI was detected in 51 (53.7%) patients. We found a significant correlation (p < 0.001) between BICAMS T scores and lower whole brain (Rho = 0.51), gray matter (Rho = 0.54), cortical gray matter (Rho = 0.51) volumes and lower p-MSNQ (Rho = 0.31), and cg-MSNQ (Rho = 0.41) scores. Multivariate logistic regression showed that p-MSNQ is related to a patient's anxiety to evaluate by Zung Score (p < 0.001) while cg-MSNQ to patient's brain volume (p = 0.01).

Together the International Osteoporosis Federation and National Osteoporosis Foundation sought to ascertain the impact on osteoporosis management. Methods Questionnaires were electronically circulated to a sample of members of both learned bodies and included information regarding the location and specialty of respondents, current extent of face to face consultations, alterations in osteoporosis risk assessment, telemedicine experience, alterations to medication ascertainment and delivery, and electronic health record (EHR) utilisation. Responses were collected, quantitative data analysed, and qualitative data assessed for recurring themes. Results Responses were received from 209 healthcare workers from 53 countries, including 28% from Europe, 24% from North America, 19% from the Asia Pacific region, 17% from the Middle East, and 12% from Latin America. Most respondents were physicians (85%) with physician assistants, physical therapists and nurses/nurse practitioners represented in the sample. The main three specialties represented included rheumatology (40%), endocrinology (22%) and orthopaedics (15%).In terms of the type of patient contact, 33% of respondents conducted telephone consultations and 21% video consultations. Bone mineral density assessment by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) usage was affected with only 29% able to obtain a scan as recommended. The majority of clinicians (60%) had systems in place to identify patients receiving subcutaneous or intravenous medication, and 43% of clinicians reported difficulty in arranging appropriate osteoporosis medications during the COVID-19 crisis.

To study the effect of lockdown on glucose control we conducted an observational, retrospective cohort study involving 98 patients followed at endocrine clinic at an inner city, community hospital in Brooklyn, NY in the period February to May 2020. Of the cohort, 60% were women, mean age was 54.1 + 15.3 years, 70% was Hispanic, 24% was African American with a predominance of type 2 diabetes (86%). Mean HbA1c of prelockdown and lockdown phase was 9.77 ± 2.26% and 9.49 ± 2.17 % respectively and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.001) both in patients with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Mean BMI of prelockdown and lockdown phase was 30.5 ± 6.8% and 30.1 ± 6.05% respectively and the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.33). Despite no significant change in BMI, the factors responsible for improvement in HbA1c might be a result of refined eating patterns (increased consumption of homemade food), increased adherence to medication and time to cope with the daily challenges of diabetes management (1).

53238,"575 Management of Acute Appendicitis During the COVID-19 Pandemic. Our Experience at The General Surgery Department in Queen Elizabeth Hospital, London",2021-05-04,"Background/Aims During the peak of COVID-19 pandemic, there were growing concerns that rheumatology patients could have an increased risk of contracting coronavirus due to the immunosuppressive drugs that they were taking. British Society for Rheumatology (BSR) recommended in its risk stratification guide in March 2020 that vulnerable patients should be either shielded or isolated according to their level of risk. The purpose of this survey is to evaluate the compliance to the risk stratification advice among rheumatology patients in a single centre. Methods Risk stratification guidance was sent out to 401 patients recommending either to shield or to isolate. Patients were contacted over the telephone between 14 September and 18 October 2020 to ensure they had received a postal letter with risk stratification advice. If received, it was checked whether they had followed the guidance. Responses received from all participants were analysed. Results 93% (373) of patients confirmed that they had received the guidance; however, 8 patients suggested they hadn’t received and we were unable to contact 16 patients, despite trying multiple times. Four patients died but they did not have confirmed coronavirus. 267 confirmed they were shielding and 83 were isolating, but 21 patients decided not to follow the guidance despite the recommendation and two patients stopped taking the drugs due to fear of contracting the coronavirus. Total 258 females and 143 males with the mean age 59. Most common diagnoses were rheumatoid arthritis (227), psoriatic arthritis (97) and axial spondyloarthritis (59). It was noted that out of 7 patients who had symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, only three patients were confirmed to have COVID-19 positive PCR test. Three most commonly used drugs were Benepali (128) followed by Amjevita (100), then Rituximab (56). Conclusion Although uptake of postal communication was high in this study, it was difficult to establish how rapidly the guidance was delivered. We realise the need to employ better ways of communicating with the patients. Innovative ways such as text messaging and social media have an important role in the delivery of a rapid mass communication during the pandemic. It was reassuring to note that only a very small number of patients had COVID-19 among the patients who followed the government advice to either shield or isolate. But, it would be interesting to see whether the incidence of COVID-19 cases rise since rheumatology patients are no longer shielding. Disclosure S. Azam: None. E. Thompson: None. N. Costello: None.

53243,341 The Diagnosis and Management of Appendicitis During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Pennine Acute Trust Experience,2021-05-04,"Introduction: COVID-19, an illness caused by the novel coronavirus usually presents as a mild to moderate flu like illness, but can lead to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and death in some patients. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic there has been special attention towards patients with diabetes. Not only is diabetes highly prevalent in patients with COVID-19, but diabetes has been reported as a significant predictor of morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, race seems to be a predictor of severity with black people dying at 2.3 times the rate of white people. Methods: Here we performed a retrospective study of 524 cases of COVID-19 at an academic center in Chicago between March 2020 until August 2020. Data were obtained from patients that consented to the study to examine the relationship between diabetes, BMI, age, and race with degree of COVID-19 severity. Not all patients had all clinical and demographic data available. COVID-19 severity was determined using a severity index obtained from the measured SpO2 divided by the FiO2/fraction of inspired oxygen times 100. Numbers ≥ 315 mmHg were defined as low severity with patients generally requiring outpatient care, while 235–314 mm Hg were classified as moderate severity generally requiring inpatient care and≤ 234 mm Hg indicated high severity generally requiring intubation/ICU care. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used for linear correlation analyses. Proportion for categorical values were compared using the Chi squared test, the means for continuous variables were compared using two-tailed t tests or one way ANOVA (with Tukey post-test) for comparisons involving more than two conditions. A multiple linear regression model was used to assess the contribution of different variables. Differences were considered statistically significant at p<0.05 Results: Among 120 patients with an A1c, 55 (46%) patients had diabetes and 65 (54%) did not have diabetes. More patients with a high severity index were seen in the cohort with diabetes compared to those without diabetes (72% compared to 28% p=0.004). Univariate analyses revealed statistically significant positive correlations with higher COVID-19 severity and older age, BMI, and African American race. ANOVA analysis revealed a statistically significant difference between increasing BMI and worse severity category with a BMI mean of 29.3 kg/m(2) in the low severity category compared to 34.9 kg/m(2) in the moderate severity category (p=0.006). A multi-variate analysis adjusting for all variables revealed that A1c, older age and race were positively associated with higher COVID-19 severity. Conclusion: Increased A1c, older age and race are positively and independently associated with a higher COVID-19 severity index. Further research regarding the relationship between COVID-19 and these associations is urgently needed.","Arosemena, Marilyn A; Pyzer, Athalia; Yu, Jovian; Flood, Blake; Rouhani, Sherin; Trujillo, Jonathan; Gajewski, Thomas; Casimiro, Isabel",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135362/,217
53263,998 Utilisation of A “COVID-Free” Hospital in The Independent Sector - Endourology Service Provision and Outcomes During The COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-05-04,"Thyrotoxic Periodic Paralysis (TPP) is an emergency associated with flaccid paralysis in which the paralysis is reversible with prompt potassium replacement and the attacks are terminated when hyperthyroidism is cured. Timely diagnosis and treatment are therefore prudent. While managing patients with flaccid paralysis, physicians should be aware of TPP as potential etiology and investigate history to identify the triggering factors and provide timely and cautious treatment with replacement of potassium, further addressing permanent approaches to treating thyrotoxicosis to prevent future recurrences of TPP. We report a clinical scenario of a patient who experienced TPP.22-year-old male, laying down at home at around 1:45pm developed sudden onset bilateral lower extremity weakness and was unable to stand up. His weakness was associated with thigh pain with exertion. He was eventually able to walk a few steps, but then fell onto his knees. He reported having a carbohydrate rich lunch at noon. Notably, patient underwent surgery under general anesthesia for a deviated nasal septum the day before. His neurological examination was remarkable for giveaway proximal lower extremity weakness involving only select muscle groups. Examination and CT/CTA of head and neck findings was not consistent with acute stroke. Myopathy secondary to electrolyte imbalance, drug/toxin, infection, or inflammatory disorders, myelopathy and myasthenia gravis were considered in the differential. Labs revealed suppressed TSH <0.01uIU/mL, elevated FT4 of 6ng/dL and low serum potassium of 2.6mmol/L. CT scan of the neck revealed enlarged thyroid gland and thymic enlargement. Patient was given intravenous bolus of potassium chloride 20 mEq and serum potassium normalized in 4 hours to 3.8mmol/L. His lower extremity weakness resolved within 3hours of potassium replacement. The next day his serum potassium was 5.2mmol/L. His thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin index was elevated at 1.4 (normal <1.3). He was started on propranolol, methimazole and advised to return to the endocrinology clinic to discuss permanent treatment options for hyperthyroidism to prevent TPP. Reviewing his prior medical history, he was diagnosed with Graves’ disease 5 months prior to the emergency room evaluation and was started on methimazole. He took methimazole for 2 months and did not return to follow up until the occurrence of TPP. He did not experience symptoms of hyperthyroidism in the interim. Discussion: TPP is a rare disorder with a prevalence of 0.1-0.2% in North America. TPP commonly affects Asian and Latin Americans males. The episodes of TPP are influenced by genetic, environmental, and ethnic factors. Common environmental triggers include carbohydrate rich meals, rest after intense physical exertion, fever, infection, trauma, emotional stress, and smoking. Thymic hyperplasia has also been reported to be associated with hypokalemic periodic paralysis. Clinical Presentation: The motor weakness tends to affect proximal lower extremities as noted in our patient’s presentation and is usually associated with hyporeflexia and is painless. Cardiac arrhythmias due to hypokalemia are rare, though ventricular fibrillation have been reported, and respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation is a possibility. Pathophysiology: TPP has been thought to be a channelopathy associated with increased Na(+)–K(+) ATPase activity and loss of function mutation of the Kir 2.6 potassium efflux channel resulting in intracellular pooling of potassium and transient hypokalemia. The attacks are stimulated by thyroid hormone excess and/or hyperadrenergic activity and hyperinsulinemia, most commonly due to carbohydrate load or intravenous fluids containing dextrose. Treatment should include:1.Potassium supplementation to reverse paralysis and prevent life threatening cardiac arrhythmias. Care must be taken to not over replace potassium, as it could result in hyperkalemia when potassium channels revert to functioning normally.2.Propranolol, a non-selective betablocker works by blocking the thyroid hormone mediated adrenergic overstimulation of the Na-K ATPase channel, there by limiting the intracellular pooling of potassium.3.Definitive treatment of thyrotoxicosis should be offered. Studies comparing various modalities of treatment of thyrotoxicosis in the setting of TPP indicate permanent treatment with either radioactive iodine or thyroidectomy are often successful in preventing recurrence of TPP, as relapse events are higher in treatment with antithyroid drugs. Caution should be taken to prevent surge of thyroid hormone release following radioactive iodine treatment, as this can trigger TPP. Higher doses of radioactive iodine might be required to render hypothyroidism and prevent TPP recurrences. There is one case report of hypokalemic periodic paralysis associated with thymic hyperplasia that was treated with thymectomy. Our patient had multiple triggers leading to periodic paralysis, including a prior untreated Graves’ disease due to non-adherence to treatment during COVID-19 pandemic, general anesthesia for nasal septal surgery the day before presenting with TPP, having a carbohydrate rich meal one hour before the episode, and thymic enlargement on neck CT scan. He responded well to potassium replacement, and propranolol. He was started on methimazole and offered permanent treatment options to address hyperthyroidism.

53287,283 Laparoscopic Surgery During Covid-19 Pandemic: A Systematic Review of Recommendations,2021-05-04,"Background/Aims There is evidence for non-pharmacological interventions to support patients to self-manage fatigue, however implementation in clinical practice is a challenge. LIFT (Lessening the Impact of Fatigue in inflammatory rheumatic diseases: a randomised Trial) is a multi-centre three-arm randomised trial using a remotely delivered cognitive-behavioural approach (CBA) or personalized exercise programme (PEP) interventions, in addition to usual care, compared to normal care alone. Interventions were delivered to patients by rheumatology health professionals using a manual, after training. The aim of this nested qualitative evaluation was to understand their perspectives of delivering the interventions. Methods A subgroup of rheumatology healthcare professionals who had delivered the CBA and PEP interventions took part in semi-structured telephone interviews to explore their experiences of training and delivery, the challenges and benefits of learning new skills, and the barriers and facilitators to supporting patients remotely (mainly by telephone) using the LIFT manual. Results A total of 17 rheumatology healthcare professionals (13 women, 4 men) from the CBA (n = 9) and PEP (n = 8) arms contributed. SB conducted an inductive thematic analysis of the data set. ED, CA, AW and KL reviewed a sub-set of transcripts. Five main themes were identified: The benefits of informative, structured training: Rheumatology healthcare professionals reflected how training, including role-play, helped them to practice their skills, even though this could feel uncomfortable. Those allocated shorter four-hour training sessions would have liked more time to practice. Many felt anxious before meeting patients for the first time but liked the manual to refer to. Getting into the swing of it: Practice gave rheumatology healthcare professionals the confidence to tailor content to individual patients’ requirements. Clinical supervision in the PEP and CBA arm supported rheumatology healthcare professionals to query their own practice, gain valuable feedback, and request assistance where needed. Benefits of telephone delivery: The initial face-to-face session enabled rheumatology healthcare professionals to build rapport with patients. Thereafter, patients seemed engaged and valued the opportunity to address their fatigue and challenge their own beliefs via the telephone. Some patients not ready to change: Rheumatology healthcare professionals struggled to work collaboratively with a minority of patients who were not willing to make changes, lacked motivation to complete tasks or stopped engaging with the intervention. LIFT developing clinical skills: Rheumatology healthcare professionals were confident that they were doing the ‘right thing’ for patients with fatigue and gained professional satisfaction seeing patients’ fatigue improve. Many felt that the skills they acquired and their experiences of remote delivery were helping them to respond to the current COVID-19 related changes in service provision. Conclusion Findings support the value of skills training for rheumatology health professionals to deliver fatigue management interventions remotely. These insights can inform service provision and clinical practice. Disclosure S.E. Bennett: None. E. Dures: None. C. Almeida: None. E. Bachmair: None. K. Lovell: None. L. Paul: None. A.

53315,890 Predictive Factors for Mortality Following Trauma & Orthopaedic Surgery in The Covid-19 Pandemic. The Manchester Equation,2021-05-04,"FUNDING ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: Type of funding sources: None. Background/Introduction: Global reports are suggestive of decline in number of patients attending hospital with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and a reduction in the number of cardiac procedures since the onset of COVID-19 pandemic. PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to compare the trend of presentations and management among ACS patients in a single tertiary cardiac centre in the West midlands of United Kingdom (UK) during the early lock down period of COVID-19 pandemic (Group 2020) in comparison to the same period of 2019 (Group 2019). METHODS: In this descriptive study patients’ records were extracted retrospectively from the electronic database who presented with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non- ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and Unstable angina (UA), during the 30 day period from mid-March to mid-April of 2020 (Group 2020), and the same period of 2019 (Group 2019). RESULTS: In comparison to group 2019, total number of ACS (153 vs 91) including STEMI (70 vs 59), NSTEMI (76 vs 31) and UA (7 vs 1) were lower in group 2020 (Fig 1A). Inter-hospital transfer (IHT) dropped from 2019 to 2020 (55 vs 17). In group 2020, percutaneous coronary angioplasty (PCI) for STEMI was similar to group 2019 (83.05% vs 88.57%) but PCI for NSTEMI were higher (80.65% vs 48.68%). No coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) services were available during the studied period (Fig 1B). In terms of troponin I (Trop I) levels at the time of admission, 47.25% of all ACS presentations were over 1000ng/L in group 2020 compared to 28.76% in group 2019 (Fig 1C). On assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at the time of admission, 24% of all ACS were severely impaired (LVEF < 40%) compared to 13.79% in 2019 (Fig 1D). 37 (31 IHT) patients in group 2019 and 16 (11 IHT) patients in group 2020 had no transthoracic echocardiogram data. There was an overall reduction in number of days spent in hospital per ACS patient from 4.78 days in 2019 to 3.70 days in 2020 and a further reduction for STEMI patients from 5.16 days in 2019 to 3.83 days in 2020. 5 ACS patients died in 2020 in comparison to 6 patients in 2019. CONCLUSION: The reduced number of admissions is likely to be a result of nation-wide lock-down and public fear. Proportion of ACS patients with high level of troponin I values and severely impaired LVEF may be explained due to late presentation. It remains necessary to address public fear and to ensure that ACS patients are managed in accordance with ACS management guidelines even in the times of COVID-19 pandemic.","Tomson, J; Khanra, D; Ntoskas, T; Wrigley, B",Eur Heart J Acute Cardiovasc Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135563/,217
53329,918 COVID-19: A Detailed Analysis on Fit-Testing for Respiratory Protective Equipment in the UK,2021-05-04,"Background: New-onset diabetes mellitus (DM) and severe metabolic complications in association with COVID-19 has been reported in the literature. Studies indicate a bidirectional relationship between COVID-19 and DM. Not only does severe DM lead to an increased risk for COVID-19 complications, but COVID-19 infection itself may precipitate new-onset DM. Clinical Case: A 45-year-old male with no known past medical history and normal body mass index presented after being found unresponsive at home. One week prior to admission, he tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus. On admission, laboratory evaluation showed: serum glucose 1090 mg/dl [70–109 mg/dL], anion gap 31 [<12], serum sodium 159 meq/L [133–145 meq/L], serum bicarbonate 18 meq/L [23–30 meq/L], creatinine 2.9 mg/dL [0.7–1.2 mg/dL], serum osmolality 438 mosm/k [280–295 mosm/k], venous pH 7.29 [7.32–7.42], venous bicarbonate 20 mmol/L [24–28 mmol/L], lactic acid 5.0 mmol/L [0.5–2.2 mmol/L], serum acetone positive 1+, urine ketone 20, hemoglobin 16.1 g/dL [14–18.0 g/dL] and HbA1c 13.5% [4.8–5.9%]. A diagnosis of diabetes with hyperosmolarity was made and he was admitted to the medical intensive care unit for treatment. Rapid resolution of hyperglycemia and hyperosmolarity was achieved with insulin infusion and intravenous fluids. He was transitioned to subcutaneous insulin on hospital day 2 and glycemic control was maintained using a basal/bolus insulin regimen. However, he experienced a prolonged two-month hospitalization due to complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy placement, pleural effusions with need for chest tube placement, and acute renal failure requiring short-term hemodialysis support. He was discharged to a rehabilitation facility on insulin glargine 15 units daily. Two-months after discharge, no weight changes were noted. Insulin was discontinued due to fasting serum glucose around 100 mg/dL and HbA1c 5.9%. Six-weeks later, a random serum glucose was 135 mg/dL and HbA1c 6.6%. He remains off glucose-lowering medications to date. Conclusion: We report an interesting case of new-onset diabetes with hyperosmolarity associated with COVID-19 infection with rapid achievement of euglycemia upon resolution of viral infection. Our case adds to growing evidence demonstrating a possible diabetogenic effect due to COVID-19 infection. There is also a complex interplay between SARS-CoV-2 virus and DM leading to a higher risk for complications. Questions remain regarding the long-term effects of COVID-19 on glucose metabolism. Patients with similar clinical presentations warrant close follow-up since it may be possible to de-escalate or discontinue hypoglycemic agents.","Yu, Ian; Sutherland, Anne; Diaz, Monica C Abreu; Cespedes, Lissette Maria",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135622/,217
53365,COVID-19 era in long-term cardiac rehabilitation programs: how did physical activity and sedentary time change compared to previous years?,2021-05-11,"INTRODUCTION: As the Covid-19 pandemic hit the UK, the way the NHS operates changed overnight. One change was the move to remote appointments (RA) by video or telephone. This meta-analysis (MA) of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) looks at existing evidence on RA and aims to discover if surgical patients are satisfied with them. METHOD: A literature search of RCTs of surgical patient satisfaction of RA versus conventional outpatient clinic (OPC) was performed. The PubMed, EMBASE and Google Scholar databases were searched to include articles from January 2000 to 2020. A random effects MA model was used to compare outcomes. RESULTS: All 5 RCTs showed that patients were as satisfied with RA as OPC (RR = 1.00, [0.97-1.03] p = 0.96). Furthermore, both patient cohorts would prefer RA for future follow-up (RR = 2.28 [1.85-2.82] p < 0.00001). 1 RCT performed a cost analysis and found the cost to institutions was less in the RA group ($19.05 vs $52.76). All other RCTs suggested cost to patients and institutions would be less for RA. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical patients are satisfied with RA and in fact would prefer them, thus indicating that out with the Covid-19 pandemic RAs could be continued, and in doing so may well save money for patients and the NHS.","Oates, Emily; Hui Chin Lim, Grace; Nevins, Edward J; Kanakala, Venkatesh",Br J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135721/,217
53702,Problems faced by Researchers and pressure on Impact Factor Journal Editors,2021,"The worldwide problem of infectious diseases has appeared in recent years, and antimicrobial agents are crucial in reducing disease emergence. Nevertheless, the development and distribution of multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains in pathogenic bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella Typhi and Citrobacter koseri, has become a major society health hazard. Essential oils could serve as a promising tool as a natural drug in fighting the problem with these bacteria. The current study aimed to investigate the antimicrobial effectiveness of tea tree (Melaleuca alternifolia (Maiden and Betche) Cheel), rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L.), eucalyptus (Eucalyptus obliqua L’Hér.), and lavender (Lavandula angustifolia Mill) essential oils. The antimicrobial properties of essential oils were screened against four pathogenic bacteria, E. coli, S. aureus, S. Tyhpi, and C. koseri, and two reference bacterial strains, while for the testing, the agar well diffusion method was used. Gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography–mass spectrometric (GC–MSD) analyses were performed on essential oils. The obtained results showed that M. alternifolia essential oil is the richest in terpinen-4-ol, R. officinalis and E. oblique essential oils in 1,8-cineole, and L. angustifolia essential oil in α-terpinyl acetate. In addition, the main bioactive compounds present in the essential oil of tea tree are rich in α-pinene (18.38%), limonene (7.55%) and γ-terpinene (14.01%). The essential oil of rosemary is rich in α-pinene (8.38%) and limonene (11.86%); eucalyptus essential oil has significant concentrations of α-pinene (12.60%), p-cymene (3.24%), limonene (3.87%), and γ-terpinene (7.37%), while the essential oil of lavender is rich in linalool (10.71%), linalool acetate (9.60%), α-terpinyl acetate (10.93%), and carbitol (13.05%) bioactive compounds, respectively. The obtained results from the in vitro study revealed that most of the essential oils exhibited antimicrobial properties. Among the tested essential oils, tea tree was discovered to demonstrate the strongest antimicrobial activity. The recorded MIC of S. Typhi was 6.2 mg/mL, 3.4 mg/mL of C. koseri, 3.1 mg/mL of E. coli, and 2.7 mg/mL of E. coli ATCC 25922, compared to M. alternifolia. Similarly, only S. aureus ATCC 25923 showed antimicrobial activity towards R. officinalis (1.4 mg/mL), E. oblique (2.9 mg/mL), and L. angustifolia (2.1 mg/mL). Based on the obtained results, it is possible to conclude that tea tree essential oil might be used as an ecological antimicrobial in treating infectious diseases caused by the tested pathogens.","Puvača, Nikola; Milenković, Jovana; Galonja Coghill, Tamara; Bursić, Vojislava; Petrović, Aleksandra; Tanasković, Snežana; Pelić, Miloš; Ljubojević Pelić, Dragana; Miljković, Tatjana",Antibiotics (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8151751/,217
54191,PERIOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOME OF HIP FRACTURES DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC,2021-05-18,"OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic has catalyzed both a health and economic crisis in the US, with growing concerns on how eating behaviors and food security (risk factors of non-communicable disease) have changed. This study examines changes in food insecurity and eating behaviors during the early months of the pandemic among US adults. METHODS: A nationwide survey of US adults was conducted in April 2020 through social-media advertisement-based recruitment to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Food insecurity was measured using a six-item validated USDA Household Food Security instrument. Eating behaviors were assessed by asking participants how their eating has changed since the pandemic (“Much More” to “Much Less”). Sociodemographic differences in food behaviors were assessed with chi-square tests, and an adjusted logistic regression model evaluated the association between food insecurity and eating behaviors. RESULTS: Overall, 5256 participants had data on eating behaviors; 58.6% were female, 43.8% aged 40–59 years old, and 56.4% were employed. Eating remained unchanged for most participants (52.7%), while 34.6% noted eating more, and 12.7% noted eating less since the pandemic. 85.3% of participants displayed high/marginal food insecurity, while 14.7% displayed low/very-low food security. Compared to those eating more during the pandemic, those eating less were more likely to be younger (24.7% vs. 17.4% aged 18–39), male (42.0% vs. 33.4%), not working, or unemployed (17.1% vs. 13.7%), and make <$30,000 a year (20.7% vs. 12.6%). When adjusting for socio-demographic variables, compared to those whose eating behavior did not change, the adjusted odds of low/very-low food insecurity was higher among both those who were eating less (AOR:6.44, 95%CI:4.96–8.37) and eating more (AOR:1.67, 95%CI:1.33–2.09). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic has catalyzed significant food insecurity, with food insecurity being associated with bidirectional changes in food consumption.

54218,EPIDEMIOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT OF PEDIATRIC FRACTURES DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC,2021-05-18,"BACKGROUND: Platypnea and Orthodeoxia Syndrome (POS) is a rare clinical condition characterized by positional dyspnoea and arterial desaturation. Various mechanisms are related to this syndrome. The simultaneous presence of abnormal anatomical findings [aortic root dilatation, atrial septal aneurysm (ASA), Lipomatous septum, and patent foramen ovale (PFO)] and an occurring ventilation/perfusion mismatch can modify intracardiac haemodynamics leading to POS in elderly patients. CASE SUMMARY: A 70-year-old man was admitted to our emergency department suffering from neurological symptoms. A brain computed tomography scan showed a subdural haematoma and the patient underwent surgical evacuation. Some days later, he experienced an acute pulmonary insufficiency (SpO(2) 63%) due to parenchymal basal pneumonia treated with endotracheal intubation. Two weeks later, despite pneumonia resolution, the patient’s dyspnoea became worse, experiencing deep hypoxia as soon as the patient sat up with a partial resolution on recumbent position. A transoesophageal echocardiogram with bubble-test was performed showing aortic root dilatation and a lipomatous interatrial septum characterized by the presence of tunnel-like PFO with large ASA resulting in a big right to left shunt at rest with no signs of pulmonary hypertension. The patient underwent PFO percutaneous closure intervention and a few days later O(2) therapy was reduced and the patient decannulated. DISCUSSION: This case illustrates how the presence of both intracardiac and extracardiac factors may facilitate the onset of POS in aged patients. Platypnea and Orthodeoxia Syndrome should be considered in patients with unexplained dyspnoea and arterial desaturation related to orthostatism. It has a good prognosis with an improvement of quality of life if the causal factor can be treated.","Dipasquale, Francesco; Musto, Carmine; Pennacchi, Mauro; De Felice, Francesco",Eur Heart J Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8188864/,217

56432,Top Three Learning Platforms for Orthopaedic In-Training Knowledge Produce Different Results,2021-08-03,"The rapid development of facial recognition technologies (FRT) has led to complex ethical choices in terms of balancing individual privacy rights versus delivering societal safety. Within this space, increasingly commonplace use of these technologies by law enforcement agencies has presented a particular lens for probing this complex landscape, its application, and the acceptable extent of citizen surveillance. This analysis focuses on the regulatory contexts and recent case law in the United States (USA), United Kingdom (UK), and European Union (EU) in terms of the use and misuse of FRT by law enforcement agencies. In the case of the USA, it is one of the main global regions in which the technology is being rapidly evolved, and yet, it has a patchwork of legislation with less emphasis on data protection and privacy. Within the context of the EU and the UK, there has been a critical focus on the development of accountability requirements particularly when considered in the context of the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the legal focus on Privacy by Design (PbD). However, globally, there is no standardised human rights framework and regulatory requirements that can be easily applied to FRT rollout. This article contains a discursive discussion considering the complexity of the ethical and regulatory dimensions at play in these spaces including considering data protection and human rights frameworks. It concludes that data protection impact assessments (DPIA) and human rights impact assessments together with greater transparency, regulation, audit and explanation of FRT use, and application in individual contexts would improve FRT deployments. In addition, it sets out ten critical questions which it suggests need to be answered for the successful development and deployment of FRT and AI more broadly. It is suggested that these should be answered by lawmakers, policy makers, AI developers, and adopters.","Almeida, Denise; Shmarko, Konstantin; Lomas, Elizabeth",AI Ethics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8320316/,217
58056,"Interrelationship Between Age, Gender, and Weight Status on Motor Coordination in Italian Children and Early Adolescents Aged 6–13 Years Old",2021-09-10,"Currently, many universities use the communicative approach to foreign language teaching. In contrast, Peoples' Friendship University of Russia (RUDN University) uses a mixed approach for these purposes, which combines both the abovementioned communicative method and the grammar-translation method, which is more traditional for Russian universities. Additionally, RUDN University provides an opportunity for students to continue learning the target language at foreign partner universities, where students can practice the language in its natural environment. In this regard, the serious research interest for us is which of our students’ language competencies will transform after graduation from these universities and how their motivation changes towards learning Spanish. The vast majority of previous research on the role of foreign language internships in increasing students' motivation to learn the target language focuses on issues related to motivation to learn the language within the framework of the communicative or grammar-translation method (Helmchen, Melo-Pfeifer, 2018; Germer, 2018; Marijuan and Sanz, 2018). This study approaches the question from a different angle and concentrates on the problem of motivating students who previously studied Spanish at a university that employs the mixed method for learning the foreign language and who later completed an internship at a partner university that in turn utilizes the communicative method. To answer this research question, we aimed to conduct a study of the formed cultural and linguistic competencies of 3rd- and 4th-year students who were and who were not on foreign internships at Spanish partner universities of RUDN University. Based on the obtained data, this research demonstrates the need to change the established approaches not only to the practice of teaching Spanish but also to the conscious use of internships as a tool to increase the motivation of students to learn the target language.","Veselova, Irina; Khimich, Galina; Terentieva, Ekaterina",Heliyon,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8449184/,217

58971,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the hospital care of stroke,2021-10-08,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in 2019 and is still an on-going pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 uses a human protease called furin to aid in cellular entry and its main protease (M(pro)) to achieve viral replication. By targeting these proteins, scientists are trying to identify phytoconstituents of medicinal plants as potential therapeutics for COVID-19. Therefore, our study was aimed to identify promising leads as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) and furin using the phytocompounds reported to be isolated from Acacia pennata (L.) Willd. RESULTS: A total of 29 phytocompounds were reported to be isolated from A. pennata. Molecular docking simulation studies revealed 9 phytocompounds as having the top 5 binding affinities towards SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) and furin. Among these phytocompounds, quercetin-3-O-α-L-rhamnopyranoside (C_18), kaempferol 3-O-α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1 → 4)-β-D-glucopyranoside (C_4), and isovitexin (C_5) have the highest drug score. However, C_18 and C_4 were not selected for further studies due to bioavailability issues and low synthetic accessibility. Based on binding affinity, molecular properties, drug-likeness, toxicity parameters, ligand interactions, bioavailability, synthetic accessibility, structure–activity relationship, and comparative analysis of our experimental findings with other studies, C_5 was identified as the most promising phytocompound. C_5 interacted with the active site residues of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) (GLU166, ARG188, GLN189) and furin (ASN295, ARG298, HIS364, THR365). Many phytocompounds that interacted with these amino acid residues were reported by other studies as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) and furin. The oxygen atom at position 18, the –OH group at position 19, and the 6-C-glucoside were identified as the pharmacophores in isovitexin (also known as apigenin-6-C-glucoside). Other in-silico studies reported apigenin as a potential inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) and apigenin-o-7-glucuronide was reported to show stable conformation during MD simulations with SARS-CoV-2 M(pro). CONCLUSION: The present study found isovitexin as the most promising phytocompound to potentially inhibit the cellular entry and viral replication of SARS-CoV-2. We also conclude that compounds having oxygen atom at position 18 (C-ring), –OH group at position 19 (A-ring), and 6-C-glucoside attached to the A-ring at position 3 on a C(6)–C(3)–C(6) flavonoid scaffold could offer the best alternative to develop new leads against SARS-CoV-2.","Zothantluanga, James H.; Gogoi, Neelutpal; Shakya, Anshul; Chetia, Dipak; Lalthanzara, H.",Futur J Pharm Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8502097/,217

Agardh (derived from algal biodiesel industry waste) biochar was investigated via batch experiments and mathematical models. The activated biochar (BC-H) was produced in a single step by using the microwave irradiation method. Thus, it was obtained with a low cost, energy efficiency and by promoting clean production processes. BC-H exhibited a remarkable adsorption efficiency (98.9%) and large surface area (1088.806 m(2) g(−1)) for removal of HCQ. The Langmuir isotherm and the pseudo-second-order kinetic models were the best fit for the equilibrium adsorption and kinetics experiments, and the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity (qmax) was found to be 353.58 µg g(−1). Additionally, the experiments with real wastewater showed that BC-H's ability to adsorb HCQ was not affected by competitive ions in the water. The Taguchi orthogonal array (L16 OA) experimental design was applied for the effective cost optimization analyses of the adsorption process by considering four levels and four controllable factors (initial pH, HCQ concentration, amount of adsorbent and contact time). Scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller analyses were used for characterizing the adsorbent. The findings showed that BC-H can be used as an effective and low-cost adsorbent in the removal of HCQ from water.

Responses elicit significant psychological distress and impairment in functioning, and include acute increases in (a) negative affect (e.g., anger, anxiety, and disgust), (b) physiological arousal (e.g., sympathetic nervous system activation), and (c) overt behavior (e.g., escape behavior and verbal aggression toward individuals generating triggers). A major barrier to research and treatment of misophonia is the lack of rigorously validated assessment measures. As such, the primary purpose of this study was to develop and psychometrically validate a self-report measure of misophonia, the Duke Misophonia Questionnaire (DMQ). There were two phases of measure development. In Phase 1, items were generated and iteratively refined from a combination of the scientific literature and qualitative feedback from misophonia sufferers, their family members, and professional experts. In Phase 2, a large community sample of adults (n = 424) completed DMQ candidate items and other measures needed for psychometric analyses. A series of iterative analytic procedures (e.g., factor analyses and IRT) were used to derive final DMQ items and scales. The final DMQ has 86 items and includes subscales: (1) Trigger frequency (16 items), (2) Affective Responses (5 items), (3) Physiological Responses (8 items), (4) Cognitive Responses (10 items), (5) Coping Before (6 items), (6) Coping During (10 items), (7) Coping After (5 items), (8) Impairment (12 items), and Beliefs (14 items). Composite scales were derived for overall Symptom Severity (combined Affective, Physiological, and Cognitive subscales) and Coping (combined the three Coping subscales). Depending on the needs of researchers or clinicians, the DMQ may be use in full form, individual subscales, or with the derived composite scales.","Rosenthal, M.

Managing a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 case: a guide for sports.,2020-11-20,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an etiological agent of the current rapidly growing outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which is straining health systems around the world. Disrupting the intermolecular association of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S protein) with its cell surface receptor human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) has been recognized as a promising therapeutic strategy against COVID-19. The association is a typical peptide-mediated interaction, where the hACE adopts an α1-helix, which can form a two-helix bundle with the α2-helix, to pack against a flat pocket on the S protein surface. Here, we demonstrate that the protein context of full-length hACE plays an essential role in supporting the hACE2 α1-helix recognition by viral S protein. Energetic analysis reveals that the α1-helical peptide (αHP) and also the two-helix bundle peptide (tBP) cannot bind effectively to S protein when they are split from the hACE protein. The context contributes moderately and considerably to the direct readout (DR) and indirect readout (IR) of peptide recognition, respectively. Dynamics simulation suggests that the two free peptides exhibit a large intrinsic disorder without the support of protein context, which would incur a considerable entropy penalty upon binding to S protein. To restore the IR effect lost by splitting peptides from hACE, we herein propose employing hydrocarbon stapling and cyclization strategies to constrain the free αHP and tBP peptides into their native ordered conformations, respectively. The stapling and cyclization are carefully designed in order to avoid influencing the peptide DR effect, which has been demonstrated to improve the peptide binding affinity (but not specificity) to S protein. The stapling/cyclization-imposed conformational constraint can effectively minimize the unfavorable IR effect (i) by reducing the peptide flexibility and entropy cost upon their binding to S protein, and (ii) by helping peptide pre-folding into their native state to facilitate the conformational selection by S protein.","Zhou, Peng; Wang, Heyi; Chen, Zheng; Liu, Qian",Molecular omics,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0mo00103a; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33174576/,217

Finding novel molecules to regulate neuroinflammation is of significant clinical value. We have previously shown that adjudin, a small molecule compound known to possess antispermatogenic function, attenuates microglia activation by suppression of the NF-κB pathway. In this study we continued to explore whether adjudin could be neuroprotective by using the transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) model. Adjudin treatment after reperfusion significantly decreased the infarction volume and neuroscore compared to the vehicle group. Staining of CD11b showed that adjudin markedly inhibited microglial activation in both the cortex and the striatum, accompanied by a reduction in the expression and release of cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6. Concomitantly, adjudin noticeably prevented BBB disruption after ischemia and reperfusion, as indicated by the reduction of IgG detection in the brain cortex and striatum versus the vehicle group. This finding was also corroborated by immunofluorescence staining and immunoblotting of tight junction-related proteins ZO-1, JAM-A and Occludin, where the reduction of these proteins could be attenuated by adjudin treatment. Moreover, adjudin obviously inhibited the elevated MMP-9 activity after stroke. Together these data demonstrate that adjudin protects against cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury, and we present an effective neuroinflammation modulator with clinical potential.","Liu, Tengyuan; Zhang, Tingting; Yu, Hemei; Shen, Hailian; Xia, Weiliang",Journal of neuroinflammation,https://doi.org/10.1186/1742-2094-11-107; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24927761/,217
63422,COVID-19 in Singapore ? a case series from primary care.,2021-01-01,"OBJECTIVES This review aims to trace the historical narrative surrounding the low dose effects of radiation on the immune system and how our understanding has changed from the beginning of the 20th century to now. The particular focus is on the non-targeted effects (NTEs) of low dose ionizing radiation (LDIR) which are effects that occur when irradiated cells emit signals that cause effects in the nearby or distant non-irradiated cells known as radiation induced bystander effect (RIBE). Moreover, radiation induced genomic instability (RIGI) and abscopal effect (AE) also regarded as NTE. This was prompted by our recent discovery that ultraviolet A (UVA) photons are emitted by the irradiated cells and that these photons can trigger NTE such as the RIBE in unirradiated recipients of these photons. Given the well-known association between UV radiation and the immune response, where these biophotons may pose as bystander signals potentiating processes in deep tissues as a consequence of LDIR, it is timely to review the field with a fresh lens. Various pathways and immune components that contribute to the beneficial and adverse types of modulation induced by LDR will also be revisited. CONCLUSION There is limited evidence for LDIR induced immune effects by way of a non-targeted mechanism in biological tissue. The literature examining low to medium dose effects of ionising radiation on the immune system and its components is complex and controversial. Early work was compromised by lack of good dosimetry while later work mainly looks at the involvement of immune response in radiotherapy. There is a lack of research in the LDIR/NTE field focussing on immune response although bone marrow stem cells and lineages were critical in the identification and characterisation of NTE where effects like RIGI and RIBE were heavily researched. This may be in part, a result of the difficulty of isolating NTE in whole organisms which are essential for good immune response studies. Models involving inter organism transmission of NTE are a promising route to overcome these issues.","Dawood, Annum; Mothersill, Carmel; Seymour, Colin",International journal of radiation biology,https://doi.org/10.1080/09553002.2021.1962572; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34330196/,217
63526,"Understanding How the ""Open"" of Open Source Software (OSS) Will Improve Global Health Security.",2016,"INTRODUCTION We hypothesized that chest compressions located directly over the left ventricle (LV) would improve hemodynamics, including coronary perfusion pressure (CPP), and return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in a swine model of cardiac arrest. METHODS Transthoracic echocardiography (echo) was used to mark the location of the aortic root and the center of the left ventricle on animals (n = 26) which were randomized to receive chest compressions in one of the two locations. After a period of ten minutes of ventricular fibrillation, basic life support (BLS) with mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was initiated and performed for ten minutes followed by advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) for an additional ten minutes. During BLS the area of maximal compression was verified using transesophageal echo. CPP and other hemodynamic variables were averaged every two minutes. RESULTS Mean CPP was not significantly higher in the LV group during all time intervals of resuscitation; mean CPP was significantly higher in the LV group during the 12-14 minute interval of BLS and during minutes 22-30 of ACLS (p < 0.05). Aortic systolic and diastolic pressures, right atrial systolic pressures, and end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2) were higher in the LV group during all time intervals of resuscitation (p < 0.05). Nine of the left ventricle group (69%) achieved ROSC and survived to 60 minutes compared to zero of the aortic root group (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS In our swine model of cardiac arrest, chest compressions over the left ventricle improved hemodynamics and resulted in a greater proportion of animals with ROSC and survival to 60 minutes.","Anderson, Kenton L; Castaneda, Maria G; Boudreau, Susan M; Sharon, Danny J; Bebarta, Vikhyat S",Prehospital emergency care : official journal of the National Association of EMS Physicians and the National Association of State EMS Directors,https://doi.org/10.1080/10903127.2016.1241328; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27918847/,217

However, reduced trapezial height has sometimes been reported after LRTI. Longer immobilization and delayed rehabilitation times are also problematic. In this study, we evaluated the clinical and radiological outcomes of patients who underwent our modified LRTI procedure. METHODS Retrospective study included 26 thumbs in 24 cases with advanced stages. Our modified Burton's procedure was as follows: (1) trapeziectomy was limited to distal-half, (2) the entire flexor carpi radialis (FCR) was harvested from the forearm, and (3) half-slip of the FCR tendon was stabilized by interference screw in the first metacarpal bone tunnel. RESULTS Pain on the visual analogue scale (VAS), the quick Disabilities of the Arm Shoulder and Hand score, tip pinch strength significantly improved postoperatively. The preoperative height of the trapezial space was well-maintained at final follow-up. Magnetic resonance imaging at the one-year follow-up showed the existence of FCR tendon ball in 15 cases. Eighteen housewives resumed their daily activities after a mean period of 10 days postoperative, while another 6 patients returned to their original jobs after 3 weeks. CONCLUSIONS Our modified LRTI method involves distal-half trapeziectomy and entire FCR interposition. A sewn FCR tendon ball always provide enough volume to fill the trapeziectomy space, which helps to prevent sinking of the metacarpal bone. Our technique produced sufficient ligamentoplasty and allowed early mobilization after surgery.","Muramatsu, Keiichi; Tani, Yasuhiro; Seto, Tetsuya; Arcinue, Jasson; Rayel, Felma; Hashimoto, Takahiro; Iwanaga, Ryuta; Sakai, Takashi",European journal of orthopaedic surgery & traumatology : orthopedie traumatologie,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00590-020-02863-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33763770/,217

She had undergone loop gastric bypass with Braun anastomosis in 2009 at another center for morbid obesity (BMI = 43 kg/m2). Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) was created after the separation of gastro-jejunostomy (GJ) and jejuno-jejunostomy (JJ). On the fifth postoperative day, the patient was readmitted with signs of peritonitis. Urgent relaparoscopy showed Biliopancreatic limb (BP) obstruction. It was then and that we understood intraoperatively the uncut Roux-en-Y caused stricture between the previous GJ and JJ staple lines.

STUDY DESIGN Prospective experimental study. ANIMALS Five clinically healthy Australian Stock Horse foals of mean ± SD age of 12 ± 3 days and weighing 67.3 ± 12.4 kg. METHODS Foals were premedicated with butorphanol (0.05 mg kg(-1) IV) and anaesthesia was induced 10 minutes later by IV injection with alfaxalone 3 mg kg(-1) . Cardiorespiratory variables (pulse rate, respiratory rate, direct arterial blood pressure, arterial blood gases) and clinical signs of anaesthetic depth were evaluated throughout anaesthesia. Venous blood samples were collected at strategic time points and alfaxalone plasma concentrations were assayed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) and analysed by noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analysis. RESULTS The harmonic, mean ± SD plasma elimination half life (t½) for alfaxalone was 22.8 ± 5.2 minutes. The observed mean plasma clearance (Cl(p) ) and volume of distribution (Vd) were 19.9 ± 5.9 mL minute kg(-1) and 0.6 ± 0.2 L kg(-1) , respectively. Overall, the quality of the anaesthetic inductions and recoveries was good and most monitored physiological variables were clinically acceptable in all foals, although some foals became hypoxaemic for a short period following recumbency. The mean durations of anaesthesia from induction to first movement and from induction to standing were 18.7 ± 7 and 37.2 ± 4.7 minutes, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The anaesthetic protocol used provided a predictable and consistent plane of anaesthesia in the five foals studied, with minimal cardiovascular depression. In foals, as in the adult horse, alfaxalone has a short elimination half life. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Alfaxalone appears to be an adequate anaesthetic induction agent in foals and the pharmacokinetics suggest that, with continuous infusion, it might be suitable to provide more prolonged anaesthesia. Oxygen supplementation is recommended.","Goodwin, Wendy; Keates, Helen; Pasloske, Kirby; Pearson, Martin; Sauer, Ben; Ranasinghe, Millagahamada G",Veterinary anaesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-2995.2012.00734.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22642499/,217

Here, we systematically reviewed animal experimental evidence of maternal obesity before and during pregnancy and offspring anthropometry and cardiometabolic health. We systematically searched Embase and Medline from inception until January 2018. Eligible publications compared offspring of mothers with obesity to mothers with a normal weight. We performed meta-analyses and subgroup analyses. We also examined methodological quality and publication bias. We screened 2543 publications and included 145 publications (N = 21 048 animals, five species). Essential methodological details were not reported in the majority of studies. We found evidence of publication bias for birth weight. Offspring of mothers with obesity had higher body weight (standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.76 [95% CI 0.60;0.93]), fat percentage (0.99 [0.64;1.35]), systolic blood pressure (1.33 [0.75;1.91]), triglycerides (0.64 [0.42;0.86], total cholesterol (0.46 [0.18;0.73]), glucose level (0.43 [0.24;0.63]), and insulin level (0.81 [0.61;1.02]) than offspring of control mothers, but similar birth weight. Sex, age, or species did not influence the effect of maternal obesity on offspring's cardiometabolic health. Obesity before and during pregnancy reduces offspring cardiometabolic health in animals. Future intervention studies should investigate whether reducing obesity prior to conception could prevent these detrimental programming effects and improve cardiometabolic health of future generations.","Menting, M D; Mintjens, S; van de Beek, C; Frick, C J; Ozanne, S E; Limpens, J; Roseboom, T J; Hooijmans, C R; van Deutekom, A W; Painter, R C",Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,https://doi.org/10.1111/obr.12817; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633422/,217

METHODS Rats were randomized into four groups and abdominal wall defects repaired with an inlay graft of AlloDerm, Permacol, or CollaMend. Rats were sacrificed at six time points and the defect area was removed and analyzed for tissue integration and physical strength. RESULTS Variable cell infiltration was seen for the three implant groups. At of the all time points examined, cellular infiltration was most rapid in the AlloDerm implants and slowest for CollaMend. At 14 days, significant cell infiltration along with putative blood vessel formation was observed for AlloDerm, while Permacol implants exhibited a moderate level of infiltration. Very few cells penetrated CollaMend implants at 2 weeks. Cells had reached the center of the Permacol implants by 1 month, whereas CollaMend implants were encapsulated with a loose coat of disconnected cells, with very few cells infiltrating past the surface. At 6 months, AlloDerm and Permacol had evidence of cell penetration throughout the implants, while the CollaMend samples exhibited limited infiltration. Animals for each implant developed seromas: AlloDerm 40%, Permacol 33%, and CollaMend 83%. Mechanical testing revealed that AlloDerm at 6 months showed the lowest tensile strength, CollaMend the highest, and Permacol an intermediate level. CONCLUSIONS The three biologics exhibited different patterns and rates of cellular and vascular permeation in our rat model. AlloDerm implants exhibited the most rapid and extensive cellular infiltration, followed by Permacol. However, on gross examination, the AlloDerm implants thinned significantly by 6 months. In contrast, the Permacol and CollaMend implants appeared to be largely intact.","Broderick, G; McIntyre, J; Noury, M; Strom, H M; Psoinos, C; Christakas, A; Billiar, K; Hurwitz, Z M; Lalikos, J F; Ignotz, R A; Dunn, R M",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-011-0891-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22120024/,217

MATERIAL AND METHODS The main outcome measures were laparoscopic entry time, total operation time, amount of bleeding, intraoperative complications, post-operative pain scores, additional analgesic requirements, and length of hospital stay. RESULTS A total of 71 women, 39 in the conventional laparoscopy group and 32 in the SILS group, participated in the study. Demographic findings did not differ between the two groups. Similarly, rates of intraoperative complications, rates of conversion to laparotomy, pre- and postoperative hematocrit levels were not significantly different between the groups. Laparoscopic entry time was shorter in the SILS group (10.4 ± 5.9 min. vs. 5.28 ± 1.7 min.). However, total operation time was similar in the two groups. The groups did not show significant differences regarding additional analgesic requirements, or postoperative pain scores after 24 h. However, pain scores in the recovery room and after six and 12 h were lower in the SILS group. CONCLUSION SILS seems to be effective and safe for the treatment of benign adnexal masses. SILS appears to be advantageous regarding postoperative pain especially in the early period.","Karasu, Yetkin; Akselim, Burak; Kavak Cömert, Duygu; Ergün, Yusuf; Ülker, Kahraman",Minimally invasive therapy & allied technologies : MITAT : official journal of the Society for Minimally Invasive Therapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/13645706.2017.1299763; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28290726/,217

Threat analysis (forecasting), which monitors the measurable risk indicators of disease emergence, should be in place before the emergence of any threat. Animal and public health authorities develop and regularly re-evaluate disease preparedness, response and recovery plans, based on the 'One Health' principle. These plans should include surveillance, biosecurity measures, communication channels and training for personnel. Scenarios for outbreaks of natural emerging infectious disease or bioterrorist events should be prepared and practised. National and international legislation should be regularly updated to provide a robust legal basis to manage outbreaks. Reference laboratories should have reliable and validated diagnostic tools for rapid, high-throughput testing. Strict biosafety, biocontainment and biosecurity control measures must be implemented in laboratories in order to prevent the accidental or malicious release of pathogens. The pharmaceutical industry should be incentivised to develop vaccines and/or antiviral drugs against disease outbreaks. Conventions between public authorities and the pharmaceutical industry should guarantee adequate stockpiling of the pharmaceuticals needed to control large-scale outbreaks. In the early phase of disease emergence (early warning), veterinarians and stakeholders play an important role in early detection at the farm level. Upon notification, veterinary authorities must take rapid response measures to limit disease spread. National and international short- and medium-term strategic research agendas should be developed, based on a comprehensive gap analysis and horizon scan. This planning will help to guide funding agencies and non-governmental organisations in their quest to support relevant research.","Cardoen, S; De Clercq, K; Vanholme, L; De Winter, P; Thiry, E; Van Huffel, X",Revue scientifique et technique,https://doi.org/10.20506/rst.36.2.2674; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30152463/,217
70843,Immune response to physical exercise: evidence to take into account during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.,2020-10-22,"BACKGROUND Elective endovascular repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm results in lower perioperative mortality than traditional open repair, but after 4 years this survival advantage is not seen; in addition, results of two European trials have shown worse long-term outcomes with endovascular repair than with open repair. Long-term results of a study we conducted more than a decade ago to compare endovascular repair with open repair are unknown. METHODS We randomly assigned patients with asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysms to either endovascular repair or open repair of the aneurysm. All the patients were candidates for either procedure. Patients were followed for up to 14 years. RESULTS A total of 881 patients underwent randomization: 444 were assigned to endovascular repair and 437 to open repair. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. A total of 302 patients (68.0%) in the endovascular-repair group and 306 (70.0%) in the open-repair group died (hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82 to 1.13). During the first 4 years of follow-up, overall survival appeared to be higher with endovascular repair than with open repair; from year 4 through year 8, overall survival was higher in the open-repair group; and after 8 years, overall survival was once again higher in the endovascular-repair group (hazard ratio for death, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.18). None of these trends were significant. There were 12 aneurysm-related deaths (2.7%) in the endovascular-repair group and 16 (3.7%) in the open-repair group (between-group difference, -1.0 percentage point; 95% CI, -3.3 to 1.4); most deaths occurred during the perioperative period. Aneurysm rupture occurred in 7 patients (1.6%) in the endovascular-repair group, and rupture of a thoracic aneurysm occurred in 1 patient (0.2%) in the open-repair group (between-group difference, 1.3 percentage points; 95% CI, 0.1 to 2.6). Death from chronic obstructive lung disease was just over 50% more common with open repair (5.4% of patients in the endovascular-repair group and 8.2% in the open-repair group died from chronic obstructive lung disease; between-group difference, -2.8 percentage points; 95% CI, -6.2 to 0.5). More patients in the endovascular-repair group underwent secondary procedures. CONCLUSIONS Long-term overall survival was similar among patients who underwent endovascular repair and those who underwent open repair. A difference between groups was noted in the number of patients who underwent secondary therapeutic procedures. Our results were not consistent with the findings of worse performance of endovascular repair with respect to long-term survival that was seen in the two European trials.

Combined with many trends that were already under way pre-pandemic, the current situation has generated significant disruption and underscored the need for change within and across AMCs. In this article, the authors explore some of the major issues and propose actionable solutions in 3 areas of concentration. First, the impact on medical students is considered, particularly the tradeoffs associated with online learning and the need to place greater pedagogical emphasis on virtual care delivery and other skills that will be increasingly in demand. Solutions described include greater utilization of technology, building more public health knowledge into the curriculum, and partnering with a wide range of academic disciplines. Second, leadership recruiting, vital to long-term success for AMCs, has been complicated by the crisis. Pressures discussed include adapting to the dynamics of competitive physician labor markets as well as attracting candidates with the skill sets to meet the requirements of a shifting AMC leadership landscape. Solutions proposed in this domain include making search processes more focused and streamlined, prioritizing creativity and flexibility as core management capabilities to be sought, and enhancing efforts with assistance from outside advisors. Finally, attention is devoted to the severe financial impact wrought by the pandemic, creating challenges whose resolution is central to planning future AMC directions. Specific challenges include recovery of lost clinical revenue and cash flow, determining how to deal with research funding, and the precarious economic balancing act engendered by the need to continue distance education. A full embrace of telehealth, collaborative policy-making among the many AMC constituencies, and committing fully to being in the vanguard of the transition to value-based care form the solution set offered.","Godley, Bernard F; Lawley, Thomas J; Rubenstein, Arthur; Pizzo, Philip A",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,https://doi.org/10.1097/acm.0000000000004155; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33983136/,217

Here, we described neurologic manifestations associated with COVID-19 in the pediatric population. METHODS Retrospective case series report. We included patients younger than 18 years, admitted with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and neurologic manifestations at our hospital in Santiago, Chile. Demographics, clinical presentations, laboratory results, radiologic and neurophysiological studies, treatment, and outcome features were described. Cases were described based on whether they presented with predominantly central or peripheral neurologic involvement. RESULTS Thirteen of 90 (14.4%) patients admitted with confirmed infection presented with new-onset neurologic symptoms and 4 patients showed epilepsy exacerbation. Neurologic manifestations ranged from mild (headache, muscle weakness, anosmia, ageusia), to severe (status epilepticus, Guillain-Barré syndrome, encephalopathy, demyelinating events). CONCLUSIONS We found a wide range of neurologic manifestations in children with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. In general, neurologic symptoms were resolved as the systemic presentation subsided. It is essential to recognize and report the main neurologic manifestations related to this new infectious disease in the pediatric population. More evidence is needed to establish the specific causality of nervous system involvement.","Sandoval, Francisca; Julio, Katherine; Méndez, Gastón; Valderas, Carolina; Echeverría, Alejandra C; Perinetti, María José; Suarez, N Mario; Barraza, Gonzalo; Piñera, Cecilia; Alarcón, Macarena; Samaniego, Fernando; Quesada-Rios, Pía; Robles, Carlos; Izquierdo, Giannina",Journal of child neurology,https://doi.org/10.1177/0883073821989164; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33646895/,217

Viruses are known to evade the establishment of an antiviral state by regulating the activation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), a critical transcription factor in the alpha/beta interferon induction pathway. Here, we show that dengue virus (DENV) circumvents the induction of the retinoic acid-inducible gene I-like receptor (RLR) pathway during infection by blocking serine 386 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF3. This effect is associated with the expression of nonstructural 2B/3 protein (NS2B/3) protease in human cells. Using interaction assays, we found that NS2B/3 interacts with the cellular IκB kinase ε (IKKε). Docking computational analysis revealed that in this interaction, NS2B/3 masks the kinase domain of IKKε and potentially affects its functionality. This observation is supported by the DENV-associated inhibition of the kinase activity of IKKε. Our data identify IKKε as a novel target of DENV NS2B/3 protease.","Angleró-Rodríguez, Yesseinia I; Pantoja, Petraleigh; Sariol, Carlos A",Clinical and vaccine immunology : CVI,https://doi.org/10.1128/cvi.00500-13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24173023/,217
75013,Moral distress in nurses caring for patients with Covid-19.,2021-04-29,"This report evaluates a dietary manipulation approach to suppress the severity of ocular infections caused by herpes simplex virus infection. The virus causes chronic damage to the cornea that results from a T cell orchestrated inflammatory reaction to the infection. Lesion severity can be limited if cells with regulatory activity predominate over proinflammatory T cells and non-lymphoid inflammatory cells. In this report, we show that this outcome can be achieved by including the short chain fatty acid salt sodium propionate (SP) in the drinking water. Animals given the SP supplement developed significantly reduced ocular lesions than those receiving no supplement. Corneas and lymphoid organs contained fewer CD4 Th1 and Th17 T cells, neutrophils and macrophages than controls, but a higher frequency of regulatory T cells (Treg) was present. The inclusion of SP in cultures to induce CD4 T cell subsets in-vitro reduced the magnitude of Th1 and Th17 responses but expanded Treg induction. Diet manipulation was an effective approach to limit the severity of viral immuno-inflammatory lesions and may be worth exploring as a means to reduce the impact of herpetic lesions in humans.IMPORTANCE Herpetic lesions are a significant problem in several persons and they are difficult to control with therapeutics. Our studies show that the severity of herpetic lesions in a mouse model can be diminished by changing the diet to include increased levels of SCFA which acts to inhibit the involvement of inflammatory T cells. We suggest that changing the diet to include higher levels of SCFA might be a useful approach to reduce the impact of recurrent herpetic lesions in humans.","Sumbria, Deepak; Berber, Engin; Rouse, Barry T",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02056-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33208449/,217

This study aims to systematically evaluate review and meta-analyze technology-assisted interventions for childhood and AYA cancer survivors. Methods: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, the study team used a pre-set of key words and searched studies across 11 electronic databases and 4 professional websites, and conducted a manual search of reference lists from published reviews. Meta-analysis of small sample size corrected Hedges' g was conducted using meta-regression with robust variance estimation. Results: Final analysis included a total of 28 clinical trials, including 237 effect sizes reported an overall statistically significant treatment effect of technology-assisted psychosocial interventions for childhood and AYA cancer survivors, g = 0.382, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.243 to 0.521, p < 0.0001. Subgroup analysis revealed that distraction-based interventions and interventions for psychosocial and emotional health were overall statistically significant, whereas interventions for childhood and AYA cancer survivors' cancer knowledge outcomes and physical and functional health outcomes were statistically nonsignificant. Moderator analysis found intervention target was a significant moderator. Conclusions: Technology-assisted interventions for childhood and AYA cancer survivors were overall effective across domains of survivorship outcomes. Favorable evidence was found primarily for childhood cancer survivors with limited support for AYA cancer survivors. Implications for Cancer Survivors: Although existing technology-assisted interventions are overall promising, research support for cancer survivors from different age groups and with different psychosocial challenges varies and should be considered individually.","Zhang, Anao; Zebrack, Bradley; Acquati, Chiara; Roth, Michael; Levin, Nina Jackson; Wang, Kaipeng; Schwartz, Samantha",Journal of adolescent and young adult oncology,https://doi.org/10.1089/jayao.2021.0012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33960845/,217

For its safe application, the risks of camostat mesylate to induce pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions with co-administered drugs should be known. We therefore tested in vitro the potential inhibition of important efflux (P-glycoprotein (P-gp, ABCB1), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP, ABCG2)), and uptake transporters (organic anion transporting polypeptides OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OATP2B1) by camostat mesylate and its active metabolite 4-(4-guanidinobenzoyloxy)phenylacetic acid (GBPA). Transporter inhibition was evaluated using fluorescent probe substrates in transporter over-expressing cell lines and compared to the respective parental cell lines. Moreover, possible mRNA induction of pharmacokinetically relevant genes regulated by the nuclear pregnane X receptor (PXR) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) was analysed in LS180 cells by quantitative real-time PCR. The results of our study for the first time demonstrated that camostat mesylate and GBPA do not relevantly inhibit P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1 or OATP1B3. Only OATP2B1 was profoundly inhibited by GBPA with an IC50 of 11 μM. Induction experiments in LS180 cells excluded induction of PXR-regulated genes such as cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and ABCB1 and AhR-regulated genes such as CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 by camostat mesylate and GBPA.

They are the third most common type of abdominal aneurysm, after aneurysms of the aorta and of the iliac artery, and account for almost the all aneurysms of visceral arteries. True aneurysms account for 60% of SAA and affect four times as many women as men, generally related to increased incidental or symptomatic findings that coincide with use of ultrasonography in pregnancy. Among pregnant patients, mortality after rupture is 65-75%, with fetal mortality exceeding 90%. There are multiple etiologies and it is believed that hormonal influences and changes in portal flow during gestation play an important role in development of SAA.

METHODS Pre-operative, peri-operative, and post-operative data were obtained from the French ""Club Hernie"" registry with 12- and 24-month follow-up. RESULTS One-hundred consecutive patients (mean age 62.0 ± 13.7; 51% female) underwent repair of 105 hernias: primary (39/105, 37.1%, defect area 5.2 ± 5.6 cm2) and incisional (66/105, 62.9%, 31.9 ± 38.7.8 cm2). The mean BMI was 29.7 (± 5.6 kg/m2). American Society of Anesthesiologists classifications were I 39.4%, II 37.4% and III 23.2%. 75% had risk factors for healing and/or dissection. Of 38 primary repairs, 37 were completed laparoscopically (combined approach n = 1), and of 62 incisional hernia repairs, 40 were completed laparoscopically, and 20 by open repair (combined approach n = 2). Laparoscopic was quicker than open repair (36.2 ± 23.5 min vs. 67.4 ± 25.8, p < 0001). Before surgery, 86.3% of hernias were reported to cause discomfort/pain or dysesthesia. At 24 months (93 of 100 patients), 91 (97.8%) reported no lump and 81 (87.1%) no pain or discomfort. Of 91 patients, 86 (94.5%) rated their repair ""good"" or ""excellent."" There were nine non-serious, surgeon-detected adverse events (ileus, n = 3; seroma, n = 6) and one hernia recurrence (6-12 months). CONCLUSIONS Compared to baseline, open and laparoscopic surgery improved PROMs 24 months after primary and incisional hernia repair. Minimal complications and recurrence support the long-term efficacy of SCM.","Gillion, J F; Lepere, M; Barrat, C; Cas, O; Dabrowski, A; Jurczak, F; Khalil, H; Zaranis, C",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-019-01924-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887379/,217

78778,Nutritional Strategies in Prediabetes: A Scoping Review of Recent Evidence.,2020-09-29,"INTRODUCTION Chronic inflammation is increasingly recognised as a major contributor to disease, disability and ultimately death, but measuring the levels of chronic inflammation remains non-canonised, making it difficult to relate chronic inflammation and mortality. Soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR), an emerging biomarker of chronic inflammation, has been proposed as a prognostic biomarker associated with future incidence of chronic disease and mortality in general as well as patient populations. Proper prognostic biomarkers are important as they can help improve risk stratification in clinical settings and provide guidance in treatment or lifestyle decisions as well as in the design of randomised trials. Here, we wish to summarise the evidence about the overall association of the biomarker suPAR with mortality in healthy, general and patient populations across diseases. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The search will be conducted using Medline, Embase and Scopus databases from their inception to 03 June 2020 to identify studies investigating 'suPAR' and 'mortality'. Observational studies and control groups from intervention studies written in English or Danish will be included. The 'Quality In Prognosis Studies' tool will be used to assess the risk of bias for the studies included. Unadjusted and adjusted mortality outcome measures (eg, risk ratios, ORs, HRs) with 95% CIs will be extracted for healthy individuals, general and patient populations. The primary outcome is all-cause mortality within any given follow-up. Subgroup analyses will be performed based on time of outcome, cause of death, population type, adjustments for conventional risk factors and inflammation markers. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION This systematic review will synthesise evidence on the use of suPAR as a prognostic marker for mortality. The results will be disseminated by publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Data used will be obtained from published studies, and ethics approval is therefore not necessary for this systematic review.

79244,Validity of the Rotterdam Elderly Pain Observation Scale for institutionalised cognitively impaired Dutch adults.,2021-05-05,"BACKGROUND Leaks and bleeding are serious postoperative complications after a sleeve gastrectomy (SG). The objective of the present study was to evaluate the costs of leaks and bleeding after SG. METHODS A retrospective analysis was conducted of a prospective cohort of primary SGs between August 2006 and September 2013 in a bariatric center. All SGs were performed consistently without reinforcement of the staple line. Abscesses adjacent to the staple line were also regarded as leaks. Data were collected on all diagnostic and therapeutic measures necessary to manage leaks or bleeding, days of hospitalization and parenteral feeding, number of blood products, antibiotics, and additional outpatient department visits. RESULTS One thousand two hundred sixty one patients underwent a SG. Leaks occurred in 32 (2.5%) and bleeding in 27 (2.1%) patients. Median additional costs for leaks were 9284 (range 1748-125,684) and 4267 (range 1524-40,022) for bleeding. Prolonged hospitalization in the ward and ICU accounted for the majority of costs, 50.3 and 31.4%, respectively, for leaks and 42.0 and 34.8% for bleeding. CONCLUSIONS These data provide insight into the costs of major complications after SG. A wide range is seen especially due to prolonged hospitalization in the ward and ICU. High costs are an additional argument to reduce complication rate. These data should be considered when analyzing the cost-effectiveness of staple line reinforcement.","Bransen, Jeroen; Gilissen, Lennard P L; van Rutte, Pim W J; Nienhuijs, Simon W",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-015-1584-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25636733/,217
79846,Pandemic threatens primary care for long term conditions.,2020-10-05,"Currently, South Asia accounts for a quarter of the world population, yet it already claims ≈60% of the global burden of heart disease. Besides the epidemics of type 2 diabetes mellitus and coronary heart disease already faced by South Asian countries, recent studies suggest that South Asians may also be at an increased risk of heart failure (HF), and that it presents at earlier ages than in most other racial/ethnic groups. Although a frequently underrecognized threat, an eventual HF epidemic in the densely populated South Asian nations could have dramatic health, social and economic consequences, and urgent interventions are needed to flatten the curve of HF in South Asia. In this review, we discuss recent studies portraying these trends, and describe the mechanisms that may explain an increased risk of premature HF in South Asians compared with other groups, with a special focus on highly relevant features in South Asian populations including premature coronary heart disease, early type 2 diabetes mellitus, ubiquitous abdominal obesity, exposure to the world's highest levels of air pollution, highly prevalent pretransition forms of HF such as rheumatic heart disease, and underdevelopment of healthcare systems. Other rising lifestyle-related risk factors such as use of tobacco products, hypertension, and general obesity are also discussed. We evaluate the prognosis of HF in South Asian countries and the implications of an anticipated HF epidemic. Finally, we discuss proposed interventions aimed at curbing these adverse trends, management approaches that can improve the prognosis of prevalent HF in South Asian countries, and research gaps in this important field.","Martinez-Amezcua, Pablo; Haque, Waqas; Khera, Rohan; Kanaya, Alka M; Sattar, Naveed; Lam, Carolyn S P; Harikrishnan, Sivadasanpillai; Shah, Sanjiv J; Kandula, Namratha R; Jose, Powell O; Narayan, K M Venkat; Agyemang, Charles; Misra, Anoop; Jenum, Anne K; Bilal, Usama; Nasir, Khurram; Cainzos-Achirica, Miguel",Circulation.

This study retrospectively compared long-term outcomes after VATS lobectomy versus lobectomy via open thoracotomy for clinical stage IA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS From July 2002 to June 2012, 160 patients were diagnosed with clinical stage IA NSCLC and underwent lobectomy. Of these, 114 underwent VATS lobectomy and 46 underwent lobectomy via open thoracotomy. RESULTS The 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate was 88.0% in the VATS group and 77.1% in the thoracotomy group for clinical stage IA NSCLC (p = 0.1504), and 91.5% in the VATS group and 93.8% in the thoracotomy group for pathological stage IA NSCLC (p = 0.2662). The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 94.1% in the VATS group and 81.8% in the thoracotomy group for clinical stage IA NSCLC (p = 0.0268), and 94.8% in the VATS group and 96.2% in the thoracotomy group for pathological stage IA NSCLC (p = 0.5545). The rate of accurate preoperative staging was 71.9% in the VATS group and 56.5% in the thoracotomy group (p = 0.2611). Inconsistencies between the clinical and pathological stages were mainly related to tumor size, nodal status, and pleural invasion. Local recurrence occurred for one lesion in the VATS group and six lesions (five patients) in the thoracotomy group (p = 0.0495). CONCLUSIONS The DFS and OS were not inferior after VATS compared with thoracotomy. Local control was significantly better after VATS than after thoracotomy. Preoperative staging lacked sufficient accuracy.","Higuchi, Mitsunori; Yaginuma, Hiroshi; Yonechi, Atsushi; Kanno, Ryuzo; Ohishi, Akio; Suzuki, Hiroyuki; Gotoh, Mitsukazu",Journal of cardiothoracic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1186/1749-8090-9-88; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24886655/,217

In this systematic review, we aimed to investigate the prognostic role of D-dimer in COVID-19-infected patients. We searched PubMed, Medline, Embase, Ovid, and Cochrane for studies reporting admission D-dimer levels in COVID-19 patients and its effect on mortality. Eighteen studies (16 retrospective and 2 prospective) with a total of 3682 patients met the inclusion criteria. The pooled weighted mean difference (WMD) demonstrated significantly elevated D-dimer levels in patients who died versus those who survived (WMD, 6.13 mg/L; 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.16-8.11; P < 0.001). Similarly, the pooled mean D-dimer levels were significantly elevated in patients with severe COVID-19 infection (WMD, 0.54 mg/L; 95% CI 0.28-0.80; P < 0.001). The risk of mortality was fourfold higher in patients with positive D-dimer versus negative D-dimer (risk ratio, 4.11; 95% CI, 2.48-6.84; P < 0.001) and the risk of developing severe disease was twofold higher in patients with positive D-dimer levels versus negative D-dimer (risk ratio, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.34-3.11; P < 0.001).

METHODS The H/R injury involved hypoxia for 3 h and then reperfusion for 2 h. Cardiomyocytes recruited from neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) were randomly divided into control, H/R, H/R+compound C (C.C), H/R+PQS, and H/R+C. C+PQS groups. BrdU assay, lactase dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage and early apoptosis rate were evaluated to assess cell damages. Contents of high energy phosphate compounds were conducted to detect the energy production. Protein expression levels of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase a (AMPKα), glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4), phosphate fructose kinase 2 (PFK2), fatty acid translocase/cluster of differentiation 36 (FAT/CD36), and acetyl CoA carboxylase 2 (ACC2) in the regulatory pathways were measured by Western blotting. Immunofluorescence staining of GLUT4 and FAT/CD36 was used to observe the mobilization of metabolic transporters. RESULTS PQS (50 mg/L) pretreatment significantly alleviated H/R-induced inhibition of NRVMs viability, up-regulation of LDH leakage, acceleration of early apoptosis, and reduction of energy production (P<0.05). Compared with the H/R group, up-regulated expression of AMPKα, GLUT4, PFK2, FAT/CD36 and ACC2 were observed, and more GLUT4 and FAT/CD36 expressions were detected on the membrane in the H/R+PQS group (P<0.05). These effects of PQS on H/R-induced NRVMs were eliminated in the H/R+C.C+PQS group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION PQS has prominent advantages in protecting NRVMs from H/R-induced cell damages and energy metabolic disorders, by activation of AMPKα-mediated GLUT4-PFK2 and FAT/CD36-ACC2 pathways.","Yu, Yong-Hui; Zhang, Pei; Wang, Cheng-Long; Liu, Jian-Gang; Li, Peng; Zhang, Da-Wu",Chinese journal of integrative medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11655-020-3194-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418176/,217

The consortium was founded in 2019 and strives to develop best-practice recommendations for evaluating the validity of consumer wearables and smartphones. This expert statement presents a best-practice consumer wearable and smartphone step counter validation protocol. A two-step process was used to aggregate data and form a scientific foundation for the development of an optimal and feasible validation protocol: (1) a systematic literature review and (2) additional searches of the wider literature pertaining to factors that may introduce bias during the validation of these devices. The systematic literature review process identified 2897 potential articles, with 85 articles deemed eligible for the final dataset. From the synthesised data, we identified a set of six key domains to be considered during design and reporting of validation studies: target population, criterion measure, index measure, validation conditions, data processing and statistical analysis. Based on these six domains, a set of key variables of interest were identified and a 'basic' and 'advanced' multistage protocol for the validation of consumer wearable and smartphone step counters was developed. The INTERLIVE consortium recommends that the proposed protocol is used when considering the validation of any consumer wearable or smartphone step counter. Checklists have been provided to guide validation protocol development and reporting. The network also provide guidance for future research activities, highlighting the imminent need for the development of feasible alternative 'gold-standard' criterion measures for free-living validation. Adherence to these validation and reporting standards will help ensure methodological and reporting consistency, facilitating comparison between consumer devices. Ultimately, this will ensure that as these devices are integrated into standard medical care, consumers, practitioners, industry and researchers can use this technology safely and to its full potential.","Johnston, William; Judice, Pedro B; Molina García, Pablo; Mühlen, Jan M; Lykke Skovgaard, Esben; Stang, Julie; Schumann, Moritz; Cheng, Shulin; Bloch, Wilhelm; Brønd, Jan Christian; Ekelund, Ulf; Grøntved, Anders; Caulfield, Brian; Ortega, Francisco B; Sardinha, Luis B",British journal of sports medicine,https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2020-103147; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33361276/,217

86283,Telemedicine Psychiatric Consultation on an Inpatient Obstetrical Labor and Delivery Unit.,2021-04-20,"The anti-cancer agent doxorubicin (DOX) has high cardiotoxicity that is linked to DOX-mediated increase in oxidative stress, mitochondrial iron overload, DNA damage, autophagy, necrosis, and apoptosis, all of which are also associated with secondary tumorigenicity. This limits the clinical application of DOX therapies. Previous studies have attributed DOX-mediated cardiotoxicity to mitochondrial iron accumulation and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which seem to be independent of its anti-tumor DNA damaging effects. Chemo-sensitization of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) in the cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) pathway induces tumor cell death despite the cardiotoxicity associated with DOX treatment. However, sGC-cGMP signaling must be activated during heart failure to facilitate myocardial cell survival. The sGC pathway is dependent on nitric oxide and signal transduction via the nitric oxide-sGC-cGMP pathway and is attenuated in various cardiovascular diseases. Additionally, cGMP signaling is regulated by the action of certain phosphodiesterases (PDEs) that protect the heart by inhibiting PDE, an enzyme that hydrolyses cGMP to GMP activity. In this review, we discuss the studies describing the interactions between cGMP regulation and DOX-mediated cardiotoxicity and their application in improving DOX therapeutic outcomes. The results provide novel avenues for the reduction of DOX-induced secondary tumorigenicity and improve cellular autonomy during DOX-mediated cardiotoxicity.","Cho, Haneul; Zhao, Xiao-Xiao; Lee, Sora; Woo, Jong Shin; Song, Min-Young; Cheng, Xian Wu; Lee, Kyung Hye; Kim, Weon","American journal of cardiovascular drugs : drugs, devices, and other interventions",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40256-021-00487-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34151411/,217

88539,Menopausal Hormone Therapy and Suicide in a National Sample of Midlife and Older Women Veterans.,2021-02-01,"Identification and characterization of virus-host interactions are very important steps toward a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for disease progression and pathogenesis. To date, very few cellular factors involved in the life cycle of flaviviruses, which are important human pathogens, have been described. In this study, we demonstrate a crucial role for class II Arf proteins (Arf4 and Arf5) in the dengue flavivirus life cycle. We show that simultaneous depletion of Arf4 and Arf5 blocks recombinant subviral particle secretion for all four dengue serotypes. Immunostaining analysis suggests that class II Arf proteins are required at an early pre-Golgi step for dengue virus secretion. Using a horseradish peroxidase protein fused to a signal peptide, we show that class II Arfs act specifically on dengue virus secretion without altering the secretion of proteins through the constitutive secretory pathway. Co-immunoprecipitation data demonstrate that the dengue prM glycoprotein interacts with class II Arf proteins but not through its C-terminal VXPX motif. Finally, experiments performed with replication-competent dengue and yellow fever viruses demonstrate that the depletion of class II Arfs inhibits virus secretion, thus confirming their implication in the virus life cycle, although data obtained with West Nile virus pointed out the differences in virus-host interactions among flaviviruses. Our findings shed new light on a molecular mechanism used by dengue viruses during the late stages of the life cycle and demonstrate a novel function for class II Arf proteins.","Kudelko, Mateusz; Brault, Jean-Baptiste; Kwok, Kevin; Li, Ming Yuan; Pardigon, Nathalie; Peiris, J S Malik; Bruzzone, Roberto; Desprès, Philippe; Nal, Béatrice; Wang, Pei Gang",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m111.270579; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22105072/,217

Methods and Results The study sample consisted of 1227 participants from the 2009-2016 Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi project (south Texas, United States) who had first-ever ischemic stroke or intracerebral hemorrhage and survived 90 days after stroke. Poststroke cognitive function was assessed by the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MSE) (range: 0-100; dementia: <78). The associations of sex with dichotomized and continuous outcomes were examined using logistic regression and tobit regression, respectively. Inverse probability weighting and multiple imputation were used to deal with missing data. The study sample was evenly distributed by sex, and primarily composed of Mexican Americans (59.1%) and non-Hispanic whites (34.1%). Women scored 2.96 points worse on the 3MSE than men at 90 days poststroke (95% CI, -3.99 to -1.93). The prevalence of dementia was 27.6% for men (95% CI, 23.5%-31.6%) and 35.6% for women (95% CI, 31.5%-39.7%), and the unadjusted odds ratio (OR) of dementia comparing women with men was 1.45 (95% CI, 1.24-1.69). The association was attenuated after adjustment for sociodemographic, stroke, and prestroke characteristics (OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.61-1.09). Conclusions Women had worse cognitive outcomes than men at 90 days poststroke. The differences were attributable to sociodemographic and prestroke characteristics, especially widowhood status. Potential mechanisms linking widowhood to dementia in the acute poststroke stage warrant further investigation to inform interventions addressing the unique care needs of women stroke survivors with dementia and cognitive dysfunction.","Dong, Liming; Briceno, Emily; Morgenstern, Lewis B; Lisabeth, Lynda D",Journal of the American Heart Association,https://doi.org/10.1161/jaha.120.016683; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633589/,217

Methods We retrospectively investigated potential patient characteristics that might be associated with an increased likelihood of receiving a telephone visit as opposed to a televideo visit for patients followed in the pediatric neurology, adult epilepsy, and general neurology practices at Montefiore Medical Center during the 30-day period starting April 2, 2020, at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York. Results We found that patients who had telephone encounters, as opposed to televideo encounters, were overall older, less likely to have commercial insurance, and more likely to have Medicaid. Among pediatric patients, a preferred language other than English was also associated with a higher proportion of telephone encounters. New patients in both the adult and pediatric groups were more likely to have televideo visits. Conclusions Our findings identify demographic factors, including age, insurance type, and language preference, which may play a role in access to televideo encounters among neurology patients in an urban center during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The effect of thoracoscopic CO2-insufflation on cerebral oxygenation (rScO2) during the consecutive thoracoscopic procedures in repair of LGEA was evaluated. METHODS Prospective case series of five infants, with in total 16 repetitive thoracoscopic procedures. A CO2-pneumothorax was installed with a pressure of maximum 5 mmHg and flow of 1 L/min. Parameters influencing rScO2 were monitored. For analysis 10 time periods of 10' during surgery and in the perioperative period were selected. RESULTS Median gestational age was 35+3 [range 33+4 to 39+6] weeks; postnatal age at time of first procedure 4 [2-53] days and time of insufflation 127[22-425] min. Median rScO2 varied between 55 and 90%. Transient outliers in cerebral oxygenation were observed in three patients. In Patient 2 oxygenation values below 55% occurred during a low MABP and Hb < 6 mmol/L. The rScO2 increased after erythrocytes transfusion. Patient 5 also showed a rScO2 of 50% with a Hb <6 mmol/L during all procedures, except for a substantial increase during a high paCO2 of 60 mmHg. Patient 4 had a rScO2 > 85% during the first procedure with a concomitant high FiO2 > 45%. All parameters recovered during the surgical course. CONCLUSIONS This prospective case series of NIRS during consecutive thoracoscopic repair of LGEA showed that cerebral oxygenation remained stable. Transient outliers in rScO2 occurred during changes in hemodynamic or respiratory parameters and normalized after interventions of the anesthesiologist. This study underlines the importance of perioperative neuromonitoring and the close collaboration between pediatric surgeon, anesthesiologist and neonatologist.","Stolwijk, Lisanne J; van der Zee, David C; Tytgat, Stefaan; van der Werff, Desiree; Benders, Manon J N L; van Herwaarden, Maud Y A; Lemmers, Petra M A",World journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-016-3853-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28058473/,217

METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 687 patients who underwent laparoscopic total gastrectomy for gastric cancer at a single institution from August 2008 to August 2014. The patients were divided into two groups according to the type of operation: 421 patients underwent TLTG and 266 underwent LATG. Clinicopathologic characteristics and surgical outcomes in the two groups were compared and analyzed. RESULTS The TLTG group had higher mean ages at the time of operation (57.78 ± 11.20 years and 55.69 ± 11.96 years, P = 0.020) and more histories of abdominal surgery (20.2% and 12.4%, P = 0.008) compared with the LATG group. Surgical outcomes such as intraoperative and postoperative transfusions, combined operations, pain scores and administration of analgesics, and complications were similar between the two groups. However, compared with the LATG group, the TLTG group required a shorter operation time (149 min vs 170 min, P < 0.001), had lower postoperative hematocrit change (3.49% vs 4.04%, P = 0.002), less intraoperative events (3.1% vs 10.2%, P < 0.001), less intraoperative anastomosis events (2.4% vs 7.1%, P = 0.003), faster postoperative recovery such as median time to first flatus (3.30 d vs 3.60 d, P < 0.001), faster median commencement of soft diet (4.30 d vs 4.60 d, P < 0.001) and shorter length of postoperative hospital stay (6.75 d vs 7.02 d, P = 0.005). CONCLUSION The intracorporeal method for reconstruction of esophagojejunostomy using a linear stapler may be considered a feasible procedure comparing with extracorporeal anastomosis using circular stapler because TLTG is simpler and more straightforward than LATG. Therefore, TLTG can be recommended as an appropriate procedure for gastric cancer.","Gong, Chung Sik; Kim, Byung Sik; Kim, Hee Sung",World journal of gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.3748/wjg.v23.i48.8553; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29358863/,217

Indeed, vimentin IFs help regulate cell mechanics and contractility, and in crowded 3D environments they protect the nucleus during cell migration. Recently, a multitude of studies, often using genetic or proteomic screenings show that vimentin has many non-mechanical functions within and outside of cells. These include signaling roles in wound healing, lipogenesis, sterol processing, and various functions related to extracellular and cell surface vimentin. Extracellular vimentin is implicated in marking circulating tumor cells, promoting neural repair, and mediating the invasion of host cells by viruses, including SARS-CoV, or bacteria such as Listeria and Streptococcus. These findings underscore the fundamental role of vimentin in not only cell mechanics but also a range of physiological functions.","Patteson, Alison E; Vahabikashi, Amir; Goldman, Robert D; Janmey, Paul A","BioEssays : news and reviews in molecular, cellular and developmental biology",https://doi.org/10.1002/bies.202000078; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32893352/,217

Health insurance mandates are effective mechanisms that many state policymakers use to increase the utilization of preventive health services, such as colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. The current study estimated the effects of health insurance mandate variations on CRC screening post Affordable Care Act (ACA) era. The study analyzed secondary data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and the National Cancer Institute State Cancer Legislative Database (SCLD) from 1997-2014. BRFSS data were merged with SCLD data by state ID. The target population was U.S. adults, age 50 to 74, who lived in states where health insurance was mandated or non-mandated before and after the implementation of ACA. Using a difference-in-differences (DD) approach with a time-series analysis, we evaluated the effects of health insurance mandates on CRC screening status based on U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guidelines. The adjusted average marginal effects from the DD model indicate that health insurance mandates increased the probability of up-to-date screenings vs. non-compliance by 2.8% points, suggesting that an estimated 2.37 million additional age-eligible persons would receive a screening with such health insurance mandates. Compliant participants' mean age was 65 years and 57% were women (n=32,569). Our findings are robust for various model specifications. Health insurance mandates that lower out-of-pocket expenses constitute an effective approach to increase CRC screenings for the population, as a whole.","Preston, Michael A; Ross, Levi; Chukmaitov, Askar; Smith, Sharla A; Odlum, Michelle L; Dahman, Bassam; Sheppard, Vanessa B",Cancer prevention research,https://doi.org/10.1158/1940-6207.capr-20-0028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32917646/,217

A multiplexed peptide-MHC tetramer approach was used to screen 408 SARS-CoV-2 candidate epitopes for CD8+ T cell recognition in a cross-sectional sample of 30 COVID-19 convalescent individuals. T cells were evaluated using a 28-marker phenotypic panel, and findings were modelled against time from diagnosis, humoral and inflammatory responses. There were 132 SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell responses detected across six different HLAs, corresponding to 52 unique epitope reactivities. CD8+ T cell responses were detected in almost all convalescent individuals and were directed against several structural and non-structural target epitopes from the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome. A unique phenotype for SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells was observed that was distinct from other common virus-specific T cells detected in the same cross-sectional sample and characterized by early differentiation kinetics. Modelling demonstrated a coordinated and dynamic immune response characterized by a decrease in inflammation, increase in neutralizing antibody titer, and differentiation of a specific CD8+ T cell response. Overall, T cells exhibited distinct differentiation into stem-cell and transitional memory states, subsets, which may be key to developing durable protection.","Kared, Hassen; Redd, Andrew D; Bloch, Evan M; Bonny, Tania S; Sumatoh, Hermi R; Kairi, Faris; Carbajo, Daniel; Abel, Brian; Newell, Evan W; Bettinotti, Maria; Benner, Sarah E; Patel, Eshan U; Littlefield, Kirsten; Laeyendecker, Oliver; Shoham, Shmuel; Sullivan, David; Casadevall, Arturo; Pekosz, Andrew; Nardin, Alessandra; Fehlings, Michael; Tobian, Aaron Ar; Quinn, Thomas C",The Journal of clinical investigation,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci145476; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33427749/,217

Advice for strict, widespread social distancing has catalysed the transformation of course delivery into fully online design across nations. This is problematic for HPE, which has traditionally relied on face-to-face learner interaction, in the form of skills laboratories, simulation training and industry-based clinical placements. The transition to online-only course delivery has brought with it a need to address particular issues regarding the construction and delivery of quality curricula and education activities. It is in this context that regional, rural and remote health professionals and academics can provide invaluable insights into the use of technology to overcome the tyranny of distance, promote high-quality online HPE and enable the ongoing development of communities of practice.

103301,COVID-19 Pandemic Outbreak May Compromise Proper Management for Critically Ill Trauma Patients.,2020-07-16,"Background There is a critical need for non-narcotic analgesic adjuncts in the treatment of thoracic pain. We evaluated the efficacy of intercostal cryoneurolysis as an analgesic adjunct for chest wall pain, specifically addressing the applicability of intercostal cryoneurolysis for pain control after chest wall trauma. Methods A systematic review was performed through searches of PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. We included studies involving patients of all ages that evaluated the efficacy of intercostal cryoneurolysis as a pain adjunct for chest wall pathology. Quantitative and qualitative synthesis was performed. Results Twenty-three studies including 570 patients undergoing cryoneurolysis met eligibility criteria for quantitative analysis. Five subgroups of patients treated with intercostal cryoneurolysis were identified: pectus excavatum (nine studies); thoracotomy (eight studies); post-thoracotomy pain syndrome (three studies); malignant chest wall pain (two studies); and traumatic rib fractures (one study). There is overall low-quality evidence supporting intercostal cryoneurolysis as an analgesic adjunct for chest wall pain. A majority of studies demonstrated decreased inpatient narcotic use with intercostal cryoneurolysis compared with conventional pain modalities. Intercostal cryoneurolysis may also lead to decreased hospital length of stay. The procedure did not definitively increase operative time, and risk of complications was low. Conclusions Given the favorable risk-to-benefit profile, both percutaneous and thoracoscopic intercostal cryoneurolysis may serve as a worthwhile analgesic adjunct in trauma patients with rib fractures who have failed conventional medical management. However, further prospective studies are needed to improve quality of evidence.

The current prespecified analysis compared BP reduction in participants with mild vs moderate baseline hypertension (ie, systolic [S]BP <160 mm Hg vs ≥160 mm Hg and DBP <100 mm Hg vs ≥100 mm Hg). A total of 1362 patients were analyzed by descriptive statistics. In all patient subgroups investigated, the NC combinations (ie, N: 20, 30, or 60 mg; C: 4, 8, 16, or 32 mg daily) provided greater SBP and DBP lowering and higher rates of BP control (defined as BP <140/90 mm Hg) than respective monotherapies or placebo, with greatest absolute BP reductions observed in the moderately elevated SBP or DBP subgroups. A trend to dose-response relationship was observed in each subgroup. In each SBP and DBP subgroup, treatment-related vasodilatory events (flushing, headache, or edema) were less frequent for patients receiving NC combination therapy than N monotherapy. These analyses support the use of calcium antagonist and angiotensin receptor blocker combination therapy in patients with both mild and moderate hypertension, for whom effective BP normalization and good drug tolerance would greatly reduce the risk of cardiovascular events.","Kjeldsen, Sverre E; Cha, Gloria; Villa, Giuseppe; Mancia, Giuseppe",Journal of clinical pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1002/jcph.712; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26829251/,217

MATERIALS AND METHODS Institutional review board approval was obtained for this prospective, single-center, HIPAA-compliant trial. Patients who were suspected of having hepatocellular carcinoma or liver metastases from colorectal cancer and were scheduled for percutaneous liver biopsy or thermal ablation were eligible for this study. Patients (n = 5) received 0.5 mg per kilogram of body weight of indocyanine green (ICG) intravenously 24 hours prior to their scheduled procedure in this study. Intraprocedurally, a handheld device composed of an endoscope that fits coaxially through a standard 17-gauge introducer needle was advanced into the liver, and real-time measurements of ICG fluorescence were obtained. A point-of-care fluorescence imaging system was used to image ICG fluorescence in biopsy samples. Target-to-background ratios (TBRs) were calculated by dividing the mean fluorescence intensity in the lesion by the mean fluorescence intensity in the adjacent liver parenchyma. The reference standard for determination of proper needle positioning in patients undergoing biopsy was final pathologic analysis of biopsy specimens or follow-up imaging. RESULTS Intraprocedural OMI was successfully performed in six lesions (two lesions in patient 3) in five patients. The median size of the targeted lesions was 16 mm (range, 10-21 mm). Four of five biopsies (80%) yielded an accurate pathologic diagnosis, and one biopsy specimen showed benign liver parenchyma; both ablated lesions showed no residual disease 1 month after the procedure. The median overall added procedure time to perform OMI was 2 minutes. ICG was found to localize with TBRs greater than 2.0 (median, 7.9; range, 2.4-13.4) in all target lesions. No trial-related adverse events were reported. CONCLUSION The clinical translation of OMI to percutaneous hepatic interventions was demonstrated.","Sheth, Rahul A; Arellano, Ronald S; Uppot, Raul N; Samir, Anthony E; Goyal, Lipika; Zhu, Andrew X; Gervais, Debra A; Mahmood, Umar",Radiology,https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.14141308; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25302707/,217

By focusing directly on masculinity as a social process, this analysis contributes to the broader literature on gender and leadership, unpacking the gendered double bind that leaders who identify as men must navigate in acknowledging and responding to risks. I examine the responses of Justin Trudeau and Donald Trump suggesting that their respective struggles to acknowledge and respond to the public health threat were not simply the result of a lack of available information to inform rational policy decisions. Acknowledging risk and taking measures to prevent rather than 'fight' are not culturally neutral, they are coded as feminine and 'weak'. Clearly, the delay in the response and subsequent spread of the virus in North America was not inevitable, other jurisdictions were able to respond more quickly. The masculinity double bind may have been one of the factors that undermined a prompt response in the increasingly macho context of North America.","Thomson, Kelly",Health sociology review : the journal of the Health Section of the Australian Sociological Association,https://doi.org/10.1080/14461242.2020.1784773; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33411649/,217

105725,[The Challenge of Rehabilitation Medicine in Portugal During the COVID-19 Pandemic].,2020-06-08,"Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells 5 (NFAT5) is a transcription factor (TF) that mediates protection from adverse effects of hypertonicity by increasing transcription of genes, including those that lead to cellular accumulation of protective organic osmolytes. NFAT5 has three intrinsically ordered (ID) activation domains (ADs). Using the NFAT5 N-terminal domain (NTD), which contains AD1, as a model, we demonstrate by biophysical methods that the NTD senses osmolytes and hypertonicity, resulting in stabilization of its ID regions. In the presence of sufficient NaCl or osmolytes, trehalose and sorbitol, the NFAT5 NTD undergoes a disorder-to-order shift, adopting higher average secondary and tertiary structure. Thus, NFAT5 is activated by the stress that it protects against. In its salt and/or osmolyte-induced more ordered conformation, the NTD interacts with several proteins, including HMGI-C, which is known to protect against apoptosis. These findings raise the possibility that the increased intracellular ionic strength and elevated osmolytes caused by hypertonicity activate and stabilize NFAT5.","Kumar, Raj; DuMond, Jenna F; Khan, Shagufta H; Thompson, E Brad; He, Yi; Burg, Maurice B; Ferraris, Joan D",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1911680117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32747529/,217

MHV-Brts31 has near-normal levels of RNA synthesis at the permissive temperature of 33 degrees C but is unable to synthesize viral RNA when the infection is initiated and maintained at the nonpermissive temperature of 39.5 degrees C. Sequence analysis of MHV-Brts31 RNA indicated that a single G-to-A transition at codon 1307 in open reading frame 1a, which results in a replacement of methionine-475 with isoleucine in nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3), was responsible for the ts phenotype. This conclusion was confirmed using a vaccinia virus-based reverse genetics system to produce a recombinant virus, Bristol tsc31 (MHV-Brtsc31), which has the same RNA-negative ts phenotype and complementation profile as those of MHV-Brts31. The analysis of protein synthesis in virus-infected cells showed that, at the nonpermissive temperature, MHV-Brtsc31 was not able to proteolytically process either p150, the precursor polypeptide of the replicase nonstructural proteins nsp4 to nsp10, or the replicase polyprotein pp1ab to produce nsp12. The processing of replicase polyprotein pp1a in the region of nsp1 to nsp3 was not affected. Transmission electron microscopy showed that, compared to revertant virus, the number of double-membrane vesicles in MHV-Brts31-infected cells is reduced at the nonpermissive temperature. These results identify a new cistron in the MHV replicase gene locus and show that nsp3 has an essential role in the assembly of a functional MHV replication-transcription complex.","Stokes, Helen L; Baliji, Surendranath; Hui, Chang Guo; Sawicki, Stanley G; Baker, Susan C; Siddell, Stuart G",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00901-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20668085/,217

Functional biomolecular gratings are fabricated by microcontact printing on the surface of tapered optical microfibers, and their structural features were characterized. The transduction principle is experimentally demonstrated, and its quantitative bioanalytical prospects are assessed in a representative immunoassay, based on patterned protein probes and selective IgG targets, in label-free conditions. This biosensing system involves appealing perspectives to avoid unwanted signal contributions from non-specific binding, herein investigated in human serum samples.

111963,Filtration Efficiency of Hospital Face Mask Alternatives Available for Use During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-08-11,"Objective The clinical spectrum of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is still evolving. This study describes the clinical characteristics and investigates factors that predict symptomatic presentation and duration of hospitalisation in a cohort of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients managed in Lagos, Nigeria. Methodology This was a retrospective assessment of patients hospitalised with COVID-19 disease in six dedicated facilities in Lagos, Nigeria, between April 1st and May 31st 2020. Participants were individuals with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The outcome measures were presence of symptoms and duration of hospitalisation. Demographic and comorbidity data were also obtained. Statistical analysis was done using STATA 15.0 software, with P < 0.05 being considered statistically significant. Results A total of 632 cases were analysed. The median age was 40 years (IQR: 30.5-49); male patients accounted for 60.1%. About 63% of patients were asymptomatic at presentation. Among the symptomatic, the most common symptoms were cough (47.4%) and fever (39.7%). The most common comorbidities were hypertension (16.8%) and diabetes (5.2%). The median duration of hospitalisation was 10 days (IQR: 8-14). Comorbidities increased the odds of presenting with symptoms 1.6-fold (P = 0.025) for one comorbidity and 3.2-fold (P = 0.005) for ≥2 comorbidities. Individuals aged ≥50 years were twice as likely to be hospitalised for more than 14 days compared to individuals aged <50 years (P = 0.016). Conclusion Most individuals had no symptoms with comorbidities increasing the likelihood of symptoms. Older age was associated with longer duration of hospitalisation. Age and comorbidities should be used for COVID-19 triaging for efficient resource allocation.","Erinoso, Olufemi A; Wright, Kikelomo Ololade; Anya, Samuel; Bowale, Abimbola; Adejumo, Olusola; Adesola, Sunday; Osikomaiya, Bodunrin; Mutiu, Bamidele; Saka, Babatunde; Falana, Ayodeji; Ola-Ayinde, Disu; Akase, Ephraim I; Owuna, Henry; Abdur-Razzaq, Hussein; Lajide, Dayo; Ezechi, Oliver; Ogboye, Olusegun; Osibogun, Akin; Abayomi, Akin",The Nigerian postgraduate medical journal,https://doi.org/10.4103/npmj.npmj_272_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33154280/,217

Following two pilot studies analysing spiked samples and material from 698 patients, we conducted a prospective multicentre cross-sectional study, including 867 patients treated with rivaroxaban, apixaban or edoxaban in clinical practice to comprehensively evaluate a simple, readily available anti-Xa assay that would accurately measure drug concentrations and correctly predict relevant levels in clinical practice. Anti-Xa activity was measured by an assay calibrated with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) in addition to ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). As an external validation, LMWH-calibrated anti-Xa activity was also determined in nine external laboratories. The LMWH-calibrated anti-Xa activity correlated strongly with rivaroxaban, apixaban or edoxaban drug levels [rs = 0·98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0·98-0·98]. The sensitivity for the clinically relevant cut-off levels of 30, 50 and 100 µg/l was 96·2% (95% CI 94·4-97·4), 96·4% (95% CI 94·4-97·7) and 96·7% (95% CI 94·3-98·1) respectively. Concordant results were obtained in the external validation study. In conclusion, a universal, LMWH-calibrated anti-Xa assay accurately measured rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban concentrations and correctly predicted relevant drug concentrations in clinical practice.","Willekens, Guido; Studt, Jan-Dirk; Mendez, Adriana; Alberio, Lorenzo; Fontana, Pierre; Wuillemin, Walter A; Schmidt, Adrian; Graf, Lukas; Gerber, Bernhard; Bovet, Cedric; Sauter, Thomas C; Nagler, Michael",British journal of haematology,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjh.17470; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33954979/,217

CASE REPORT A 57-year-old woman underwent laparoscopic hysterosacropexy for a Stage 2 uterine prolapse, presenting with acute abdominal pain and a bowel obstruction syndrome 2 days following the surgery. Conservative treatment was given, but the symptoms did not improve and gradually became worse. Diagnostic laparoscopy was performed on the 7th day after the hysterosacropexy, and the volvulus was found. The residual end of the barbed V-Loc adopted in the peritoneal closure was incidentally hooked to the mesentery and caused small bowel obstruction. The redundant V-Loc was released and cut off at 2 cm. Neither bowel ischemia nor significant bowel injury was noted. Two days later, she was discharged without complication. CONCLUSION A barbed suture has a risk of bowel obstruction when used in surgery. To avoid a grave prognosis, early diagnosis and prompt management of complication is necessary.","Chen, Hsuan; Hong, Mun-Kun; Ding, Dah-Ching",Taiwanese journal of obstetrics & gynecology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tjog.2016.03.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28420518/,217

Senescent cells persist during aging and promote age-related pathologies via the pro-inflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), whose regulation depends on environmental factors. In vivo, a major environmental variable is oxygenation, which varies among and within tissues. Here, we demonstrate that senescent cells express lower levels of detrimental pro-inflammatory SASP factors in physiologically hypoxic environments, as measured in culture and in tissues. Mechanistically, exposure of senescent cells to low-oxygen conditions leads to AMPK activation and AMPK-mediated suppression of the mTOR-NF-κB signaling loop. Finally, we demonstrate that treatment with hypoxia-mimetic compounds reduces SASP in cells and tissues and improves strength in chemotherapy-treated and aged mice. Our findings highlight the importance of oxygen as a determinant for pro-inflammatory SASP expression and offer a potential new strategy to reduce detrimental paracrine effects of senescent cells.","van Vliet, Thijmen; Varela-Eirin, Marta; Wang, Boshi; Borghesan, Michela; Brandenburg, Simone M; Franzin, Rossana; Evangelou, Konstantinos; Seelen, Marc; Gorgoulis, Vassilis; Demaria, Marco",Molecular cell,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2021.03.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33823141/,217
117578,Exploring the impact of COVID-19 on the willingness of older adults to participate in physiology research: views from past and potential volunteers.,2021-06-28,"INTRODUCTION This study sought to analyse differences in epidemiology and survival between women and men living with HIV in the CoRIS cohort and the course of their disease over a 10-year period. METHODS Variables of interest between women living with HIV and men living with HIV were compared. A trend analysis was performed using the Mantel-Haenszel test. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and a Cox regression analysis were used to study survival. RESULTS A total of 10,469 people were enrolled; of them, 1,742 (16.6%) were women. At the time of enrolment in the cohort, women living with HIV, compared to men living with HIV, had higher rates of transmission due to intravenous drug use (IDU), hepatitisC virus (HCV) coinfection, AIDS-stage disease and foreign origin. They also had a worse immunovirological status and a lower educational level. These differences were maintained in the trend study. Regarding age, the women included in the cohort were older whereas the men were younger. In the comparative analysis between women according to place of origin, we found that the group of Spanish women living with HIV featured older women with higher rates of IDU transmission and HCV coinfection, whereas the group of women living with HIV born outside of Spain featured women with higher rates of syphilis infection. There were no major differences in relation to other characteristics such as educational level or disease status. Although sex was not a determinant of survival, conditions more prevalent in women were determinants of survival. CONCLUSIONS HIV-infected women presented at diagnosis with certain epidemiological and HIV-associated characteristics that made them more vulnerable. These trends became more marked or did not improve during the years of observation.","Muñoz Hornero, Constanza; Muriel, Alfonso; Montero, Marta; Iribarren, José Antonio; Masía, Mar; Muñoz, Leopoldo; Sampériz, Gloria; Navarro, Gemma; Moreno, Santiago; Pérez-Elías, María Jesús",Enfermedades infecciosas y microbiologia clinica,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eimc.2020.05.021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680794/,217
117766,Patient-facing healthcare workers and their families have a higher risk of hospital admission with COVID-19 than the general population.,2021-05-26,"OBJECTIVE To assess the prevalence of and risk factors for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in patients with COVID-19. METHODS We conducted a cohort study between March and May 2020 at the Lille University Hospital (France), including all patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Psychological distress symptoms were measured 3 weeks after onset of COVID-19 symptoms using the Impact of Event Scale-6 items (IES-6). The evaluation of PTSD symptoms using the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) took place 1 month later. Bivariate analyses were performed to analyze the relationship between PCL-5 scores and the demographic and health variables. The significant variables were then introduced into a multivariable linear regression analysis to establish their relative contributions to the severity of PTSD symptoms. RESULTS 180 patients were included in this study, and 138 patients completed the 2 evaluations. Among the 180 patients, 70.4% patients required hospitalization, and 30.7% were admitted to the intensive care unit. The prevalence of PTSD was 6.5%, and the predictive factors of PTSD included psychological distress at the onset of the illness and a stay in an intensive care unit. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of PTSD in patients with COVID-19 is not as high as that reported among patients during previous epidemics. Initial psychological responses were predictive of a PTSD diagnosis, even though most patients showing acute psychological distress (33.5% of the sample) improved in the following weeks. PTSD symptoms also increased following a stay in an intensive care unit. Future studies should assess the long-term consequences of COVID-19 on patients' mental health.","Horn, Mathilde; Wathelet, Marielle; Fovet, Thomas; Amad, Ali; Vuotto, Fanny; Faure, Karine; Astier, Thibault; Noël, Hélène; Duhem, Margot Henry Stéphane; Vaiva, Guillaume; D'Hondt, Fabien",The Journal of clinical psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.4088/jcp.20m13641; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33296149/,217
117876,[Ethics Committees in Portugal: Old and New Challenges].,2020-05-04,"BACKGROUND Barbed sutures were developed to reduce operative time and improve security of wound closure. OBJECTIVE The authors compare absorbable barbed sutures (V-Loc, Covidien, Mansfield, Massachusetts) with conventional (smooth) absorbable sutures for soft tissue approximation. METHOD A prospective multicenter randomized study comparing barbed sutures with smooth sutures was undertaken between August 13, 2009, and January 31, 2010, in 241 patients undergoing abdominoplasty, mastopexy, and reduction mammaplasty. Each patient received barbed sutures on 1 side of the body, with deep dermal sutures eliminated or reduced. Smooth sutures with deep dermal and subcuticular closure were used on the other side as a control. The primary endpoint was dermal closure time. Safety was assessed through adverse event reporting through a 12-week follow-up. RESULTS A total of 229 patients were ultimately treated (115 with slow-absorbing polymer and 114 with rapid-absorbing polymer). Mean dermal closure time was significantly quicker with the barbed suture compared with the smooth suture (12.0 vs 19.2 minutes; P<.001), primarily due to the need for fewer deep dermal sutures. The rapid-absorbing barbed suture showed a complication profile equivalent to the smooth suture, while the slow-absorbing barbed suture had a higher incidence of minor suture extrusion. CONCLUSIONS Barbed sutures enabled faster dermal closure quicker than smooth sutures, with a comparable complication profile.

118425,100 days on: the primary care response to COVID-19 in Singapore.,2020-11-30,"BACKGROUND Although 5-year clinical data exist for different zirconia implants, no analysis has yet been performed focusing on how the surface topography of the implant affects clinical parameters. PURPOSE To analyze the influence of zirconia implant topography on first bone implant contact (fBIC). MATERIALS AND METHODS In a prospective two-center cohort investigation 63 zirconia implants were evaluated at implant placement, prosthetic delivery, 1, 3, and 5 years. The distance (DIB) between implant shoulder and fBIC was measured at each time point in periapical radiographs at mesial and distal sites. Two-way ANOVA/Bonferroni was used to analyze the effects of time and center (α < 0.05). RESULTS Between the centers, the mean DIB varied significantly at implant placement (Freiburg [FR]: 1.4 ± 0.6 mm; Zurich [ZH]: 0.8 ± 0.5 mm). Thereafter, no statistically significant difference in DIB was observed, neither between centers nor between time points (prosthetic delivery: FR: 1.9 ± 0.6 mm, ZH: 1.7 ± 0.8 mm; 1 year: FR: 1.8 ± 0.6 mm, ZH: 1.6 ± 0.8 mm; 3 years: FR: 1.9 ± 0.8 mm, ZH: 1.7 ± 0.8 mm; 5 years: FR: 1.9 ± 0.8 mm, ZH 1.8 ± 0.6 mm). The overall mean DIB at prosthetic delivery to 5 years of both centers (1.8 ± 0.7 mm) is located within the transition zone between the smooth neck and the moderately rough intraosseous part (1.6-2.0 mm from the implant shoulder). However, individual DIB values are ranging from 0.1 to 4.2 mm overlapping the transition zone. CONCLUSIONS The standard deviation of the DIB indicates that the fBIC establishes on moderately rough and smooth surfaces. Consequently, soft tissue adapts to both topographies as well.","Rohr, Nadja; Balmer, Marc; Jung, Ronald E; Kohal, Ralf J; Spies, Benedikt C; Hämmerle, Christoph H F; Fischer, Jens",Clinical implant dentistry and related research,https://doi.org/10.1111/cid.13013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34047019/,217

119204,Reducing the rate of psychiatric Re-ADMISsions in Bipolar Disorder using smartphones The RADMIS trial.,2020-12-23,"BACKGROUND The current trend in thoracoscopic surgery is to use fewer ports to decrease postoperative pain, chest wall paresthesia, and duration of hospital stay. In this study we compared the results of our current experience with single-incision thoracoscopic surgery (SITS) and conventional three-port video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (3P-VATS). METHODS From October 2011 to August 2012, 37 consecutive patients underwent thoracoscopic surgery. This is a non-randomized retrospective study. Among these patients, 19 (SITS group) were treated using single port method (SITS), whereas 18 (3P-VATS group) were treated using the conventional three-port methods (3P-VATS). The surgical duration, number of resected lesions, duration of chest drainage, duration of hospital stay, inpatient pain scores, and patient satisfaction scores were compared between both groups. RESULTS The mean age at surgery, indication, gender, body mass index, and the side involved were similar in both groups. The procedures performed in the SITS group were similar to those performed in the 3P-VATS group. The mean operative time was longer in the SITS group compared with the 3P-VATS group. Duration of postoperative drainage days and hospital stay was shorter in the SITS group compared with the 3P-VATS group, although these differences were not statistically significant. Pain scores on postoperative days 0,1, and 3 were significantly higher in patients who underwent 3P-VATS compared with those who underwent SITS (p = 0.012, 0.039, and 0.037, respectively). The SITS group reported higher patient satisfaction scores than the 3P-VATS group, patients in the 3P-VATS group tended to receive higher total doses of analgesics (NSAIDs) after surgery compared with those in the SITS group, although these differences were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS Our experience demonstrated that SITS decreased postoperative pain and resulted in higher patient satisfaction compared with the conventional three-port VATS. However, a prospective, randomized study is needed to confirm our preliminary findings. To overcome the technological limitations of SITS, the development of new instruments is needed.","Tamura, Masaya; Shimizu, Yosuke; Hashizume, Yasuo",Journal of cardiothoracic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1186/1749-8090-8-153; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23759173/,217
119394,COVID - A Caring Reflection.,2020-06-01,"Flexible and stretchable supercapacitors (FS-SCs) are promising energy storage devices for wearable electronics due to their versatile flexibility/stretchability, long cycle life, high power density, and safety. Transition metal compounds (TMCs) can deliver a high capacitance and energy density when applied as pseudocapacitive or battery-like electrode materials owing to their large theoretical capacitance and faradaic charge-storage mechanism. The recent development of TMCs (metal oxides/hydroxides, phosphides, sulfides, nitrides, and selenides) as electrode materials for FS-SCs are discussed here. First, fundamental energy-storage mechanisms of distinct TMCs, various flexible and stretchable substrates, and electrolytes for FS-SCs are presented. Then, the electrochemical performance and features of TMC-based electrodes for FS-SCs are categorically analyzed. The gravimetric, areal, and volumetric energy density of SC using TMC electrodes are summarized in Ragone plots. More importantly, several recent design strategies for achieving high-performance TMC-based electrodes are highlighted, including material composition, current collector design, nanostructure design, doping/intercalation, defect engineering, phase control, valence tuning, and surface coating. Integrated systems that combine wearable electronics with FS-SCs are introduced. Finally, a summary and outlook on TMCs as electrodes for FS-SCs are provided.","Lyu, Lulu; Hooch Antink, Wytse; Kim, Young Seong; Kim, Chae Won; Hyeon, Taeghwan; Piao, Yuanzhe",Small,https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202101974; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34323350/,217
119519,An Analytical Perspective on Pandemic Recovery.,2020-06-11,"The increasing amount of food waste generated as a direct consequence of its excessive production, mismanagement, and wasteful behaviors represents a real challenge in promoting resource efficiency. In the United Kingdom (UK), the lack of robust mass flow data hinders the ability both to understand and address food waste challenges and to devise long-term sustainable prevention strategies. In recognition of these challenges, this paper seeks to (i) provide insights into the UK's annual estimates of food mass flows, including imports, exports, distribution, consumption, surplus food production, and final disposal; and (ii) scrutinize the uptake and redistribution of surplus food as a potential food waste prevention strategy. Evidence collected from several enterprises and community-led initiatives in the UK, and London specifically, supports that there is an increasing potential of making a shift towards food redistribution and reuse. Further analysis has shown that the outreach of food redistribution initiatives in the UK is currently limited, possibly because redistribution efforts remain largely fragmented and independent from each other. It is concluded that a national commitment could be instrumental in encouraging the roll-out of this practice, and governmental support through fiscal incentives could lead to the development of a larger and coherent surplus food redistribution system, ultimately enabling food waste prevention and recovery of food's multidimensional value. IMPLICATIONS This paper deals with the topical issue of the increasing amount of food waste generated as a direct consequence of excessive production, mismanagement, and wasteful behavior, representing a real challenge in achieving sustainability and resource efficiency. Currently, only a small fraction of food is redistributed back into the system. Yet, a considerable fraction of food waste generated is edible; thus, better planning, storage, and coordination amongst the different stakeholders in the food supply chain is required in order to prevent its wastage and promote its reuse in accordance with the waste hierarchy.","Facchini, Elisa; Iacovidou, Eleni; Gronow, Jan; Voulvoulis, Nikolaos",Journal of the Air & Waste Management Association,https://doi.org/10.1080/10962247.2017.1405854; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29215968/,217

Because of atypical and asymptomatic carriage of the virus and nosocomial spread within institutions, timely diagnosis remains a challenge. Machine learning models trained on blood test results have shown promise in identifying cases of Covid-19. AIMS To train and validate a machine learning model capable of differentiating Covid-19 positive from negative patients using routine blood tests and assess the model's accuracy against atypical and asymptomatic presentations. DESIGN AND METHODS We conducted a retrospective analysis of medical admissions to our institution during March and April 2020.

METHODS In this multicenter trial, we tested the superiority of dalteparin over unfractionated heparin by randomly assigning 3764 patients to receive either subcutaneous dalteparin (at a dose of 5000 IU once daily) plus placebo once daily (for parallel-group twice-daily injections) or unfractionated heparin (at a dose of 5000 IU twice daily) while they were in the intensive care unit. The primary outcome, proximal leg deep-vein thrombosis, was diagnosed on compression ultrasonography performed within 2 days after admission, twice weekly, and as clinically indicated. Additional testing for venous thromboembolism was performed as clinically indicated. Data were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. RESULTS There was no significant between-group difference in the rate of proximal leg deep-vein thrombosis, which occurred in 96 of 1873 patients (5.1%) receiving dalteparin versus 109 of 1873 patients (5.8%) receiving unfractionated heparin (hazard ratio in the dalteparin group, 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68 to 1.23; P=0.57). The proportion of patients with pulmonary emboli was significantly lower with dalteparin (24 patients, 1.3%) than with unfractionated heparin (43 patients, 2.3%) (hazard ratio, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.88; P=0.01). There was no significant between-group difference in the rates of major bleeding (hazard ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.34; P=0.98) or death in the hospital (hazard ratio, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.80 to 1.05; P=0.21).

METHODS The IWI was applied to 1106 community-dwelling adults aged 60 years and over. The sample was additionally assessed using scales for comorbidity, disability, mood, general orientation to life, social support, health-related quality of life, and two questions assessing satisfaction with life as a whole and with life in Spain. The PWI and NWI were separately analyzed for acceptability, internal consistency, convergent and discriminative validity, and precision. Linear regression analyses of the PWI and the NWI were also conducted. RESULTS Mean scores were 71.0 ± 13.5 for the PWI and 49.5 ± 14.4 for the NWI. No floor or ceiling effects were detected. Cronbach's α was 0.88 for the PWI and 0.92 for the NWI. Factor analysis identified two factors in the IWI, and one factor in the PWI and NWI respectively. The PWI showed a correlation of 0.50 with the ""satisfaction with life as a whole"" item, and the NWI showed a correlation of 0.73 with the ""satisfaction with life in Spain"" item. There were significant differences in scores: in the PWI, according to gender, age, social support, education and depression; and in the NWI, according to education and depression.

METHODS A total of 36 confirmed COVID-19 patients were divided into the general (n = 17) and critical group (n = 19). The suspected group enrolled 23 suspected COVID-19 patients with the negative nucleic acid test result. We collected all patients' clinical characteristics and some laboratory indicators at the time of admission and conducted Logistic regression analysis after comparing the differences between groups. RESULTS There were no significant differences in age, gender, disease duration, fever history, and comorbidities between the suspected and general group (P > 0.05); however, fibrinogen was statistically different (P < 0.05). Compared with the general group, the oxygenation index and lymphocytes were significantly reduced and the Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) and total bilirubin were increased in the critical group (P < 0.05). The fibrinogen OR value was 2.52 (95% CI 1.18-5.36, P = 0.017) and the NLR OR value was 2.91 (95% CI 1.36-6.21, P = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS Fibrinogen is a valuable diagnostic predictor for patients with suspected COVID-19. For confirmed COVID-19 patients, the NLR is a valuable early warning indicator.","Song, Lu; Dong, Yongkang; Xu, Ming; Shi, Dongwu; Guo, Wei; Li, Yaojun; Zhang, Xinri; Ma, Xia",Expert review of respiratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/17476348.2020.1793674; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32701376/,217
125908,Curbing Youth E-cigarette Use Must Remain a Priority.,2020-05-11,"BACKGROUND Despite the known contribution of sport to health and well-being, sport participation declines in older age. However, for some people, sport continues to play an important role in older age and may contribute to improved health and well-being in older years. Although the health-related benefits of participating in sport are commonly reported, the reasons why some older adults continue to play sport are not well understood. This systematic review aimed to (1) identify studies from the literature that evaluated the reasons why older adults (aged 55 years and older) participate in sport and (2) synthesize and discuss the reasons for their participation reported in the literature. METHODS Searches of the electronic databases Embase, Medline, PsycInfo, PubMed, and SPORTDiscus were performed. Studies were included that evaluated reasons for sport participation in adults aged 55 years and older because this is the age at which sport participation has been reported to begin declining. The studies included in this review used qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methods designs, were peer reviewed, and were published in the English language before the search date (20 January 2019). RESULTS A total of 1732 studies were identified. After exclusions, 30 studies were included in the review (16 qualitative, 10 quantitative, and 4 mixed methods). The review presents several features and findings from the studies, including a description and systematization of the reasons for participating in sport and the main reasons that participants gave for participating in sport (maintaining health, feeling and being part of a community, and taking advantage of opportunities to develop relationships). Other reasons included competing and attaining a feeling of achievement, taking advantage of opportunities for travel, and being part of a team. Sport was identified as contributing to the overall experience of successful ageing. There were few comparative differences for participating in sport, and there were only small differences between genders for the reasons given for participation. Generally, the quality of the studies was good; however, mixed methods studies lacked appropriate data analysis procedures. CONCLUSION Older adults play sport for a range of health-related and social reasons that can contribute to the experience of successful ageing. Strategies to increase sport participation by older adults should focus on promoting these aspects.","Stenner, Brad J; Buckley, Jonathan D; Mosewich, Amber D",Journal of sport and health science,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jshs.2019.11.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33308804/,217

DESIGN Multicenter observational study. SETTING Fifteen PICUs across the United Kingdom. PATIENTS Patients admitted to United Kingdom PICUs with pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 between March 14, 2020, and May 20, 2020. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Deidentified data collected as part of routine clinical care were analyzed. All children were diagnosed and staged for acute kidney injury based on the level of serum creatinine above the upper limit of reference interval values according to published guidance. Severe acute kidney injury was defined as stage 2/3 acute kidney injury. Uni- and multivariable analyses were performed to study the association between demographic data, clinical features, markers of inflammation and cardiac injury, and severe acute kidney injury. Over the study period, 116 patients with pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 were admitted to 15 United Kingdom PICUs. Any-stage acute kidney injury occurred in 48 of 116 patients (41.4%) and severe acute kidney injury in 32 of 116 (27.6%) patients, which was mostly evident at admission (24/32, 75%). In univariable analysis, body mass index, hyperferritinemia, high C-reactive protein, Pediatric Index of Mortality 3 score, vasoactive medication, and invasive mechanical ventilation were associated with severe acute kidney injury. In multivariable logistic regression, hyperferritinemia was associated with severe acute kidney injury (compared with nonsevere acute kidney injury; adjusted odds ratio 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.08; p = 0.04). Severe acute kidney injury was associated with longer PICU stay (median 5 days [interquartile range, 4-7 d] vs 3 days [interquartile range, 1.5-5 d]; p < 0.001) and increased duration of invasive mechanical ventilation (median 4 days [interquartile range, 2-6 d] vs 2 days [interquartile range, 1-3 d]; p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS Severe acute kidney injury occurred in just over a quarter of children admitted to United Kingdom PICUs with pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2. Hyperferritinemia was significantly associated with severe acute kidney injury. Severe acute kidney injury was associated with increased duration of stay and ventilation. Although short-term outcomes for acute kidney injury in pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 appear good, long-term outcomes are unknown.","Deep, Akash; Upadhyay, Gaurang; du Pré, Pascale; Lillie, Jon; Pan, Daniel; Mudalige, Nadeesha; Kanthimathinathan, Hari Krishnan; Johnson, Mae; Riphagen, Shelley; Dwarakanathan, Buvana; Raffaj, Dusan; Sundararajan, Santosh; Davies, Patrick; Mohammad, Zoha; Shetty, Nayan; Playfor, Stephen; Jardine, Michelle; Ross, Oliver; Levin, Richard; Waters, Gareth; Sinha, Ruchi; Scholefield, Barnaby R; Boot, Elizabeth; Koul, Ashwani; Freire-Gomez, Xabier; Ramnarayan, Padmanabhan",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000004662; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33044282/,217
127032,"Covid-19: Care home residents in England should have ""safe spaces"" for visits from family and friends, says guidance.",2020-11-05,"OBJECTIVE We aimed to assess the prognostic significance of microscopic vessel invasion (MVI) and visceral pleural invasion (VPI) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). BACKGROUND VPI is included in the current tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) classification in NSCLC; however, MVI is not incorporated in TNM classification. METHODS From August 1992 to December 2009, 2657 consecutive patients with pathological T1-4N0-2M0 NSCLC underwent complete resection. In addition to conventional staging factors, we evaluated MVI histologically and analyzed its significance in NSCLC recurrence prognosis. The recurrence-free period in several NSCLC subgroups was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression analysis. RESULTS The proportion of patients with a 5-year recurrence-free period was 52.6% and 87.5%, respectively, in those with and without MVI (P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that MVI, similarly to VPI, was found to be an independently significant predictor of recurrence [hazard ratio (HR): 2.78]. In particular, MVI and VPI were the 2 strongest significant independent predictors of recurrence in 1601 patients with pathological stage I disease treated without adjuvant chemotherapy (HR: 2.74 and 1.84, respectively). In each T subgroup analysis, evident and significant separation of the recurrence-free proportion curves were observed among the 3 groups (VPI and MVI absent, VPI or MVI present, and VPI and MVI present). CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrated that MVI was a significant independent risk factor for recurrence in patients with a resected T1-4N0-2M0 NSCLC. Further data on MVI prognostic impact should be collected for the next revision of the TNM staging system.","Neri, Shinya; Yoshida, Junji; Ishii, Genichiro; Matsumura, Yuki; Aokage, Keiju; Hishida, Tomoyuki; Nagai, Kanji",Annals of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0000000000000617; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24646539/,217

A number of SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant women have been reported. However, more information is still needed on the pregnancy outcome and the neonates regarding COVID-19 pneumonia.Material and Methods: A systematic search was done and nine articles on COVID-19 pneumonia and SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant women were extracted. Some maternal-fetal characteristics were extracted to be included in the meta-analysis.Results: The present meta-analysis was conducted on 87 SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant women. Almost 65% of the patients reported a history of exposure to an infected person, 78% suffered from mild or moderate COVID-19, 99.9% had successful termination, 86% had cough, and 68% had fever (p = .022 and p < .001). The overall proportions of vertical transmission, still birth, and neonatal death were zero, 0.002, and, 0.002, respectively (p = 1, p = .86, and p = .89, respectively). The means of the first- and fifth-minute Apgar scores were 8.86 and 9, respectively (p < .001 for both). The confounding role of history of underlying diseases with an estimated overall proportion of 33% (p = .03) resulted in further investigations due to sample size limitation. A natural history of COVID-19 pneumonia in the adult population was presented, as well.Conclusion: Currently, no evidence of vertical transmission has been suggested at least in late pregnancy. No hazards have been detected for fetuses or neonates. Although pregnant women are at an immunosuppressive state due to the physiological changes during pregnancy, most patients suffered from mild or moderate COVID-19 pneumonia with no pregnancy loss, proposing a similar pattern of the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia to that of other adult populations.","Kasraeian, Maryam; Zare, Marjan; Vafaei, Homeira; Asadi, Nasrin; Faraji, Azam; Bazrafshan, Khadijeh; Roozmeh, Shohreh","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",https://doi.org/10.1080/14767058.2020.1763952; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32429786/,217
128486,Impact of COVID-19 on Heart Failure Self-Care: A Qualitative Study.,2021-02-11,"PURPOSE Breast cancer is the most common cancer and leading cause of cancer death in women. Body composition parameters, especially those related to muscle, have become a growing focus of cancer research. In this review, we summarize the literature on breast cancer and muscle parameters as well as combine their outcomes for overall survival (OS), time to tumor progression (TTP), and chemotherapy toxicity in a meta-analysis. METHODS A systematic search of the literature for randomized controlled trials and observational studies was conducted on MEDLINE, Cochrane CENTRAL, and EMBASE through May 1, 2019. Two reviewers independently searched and selected. Meta-analysis was conducted using a random-effects model. The risk of bias was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment for cohorts and GRADE summary of findings tool from Cochrane. RESULTS A total of 754 articles were screened from which 6 articles and one abstract were selected. Using skeletal muscle index (SMI), patients classified as sarcopenic had a 68% greater mortality risk compared to non-sarcopenic patients (HR 1.68 95% CI 1.09-2.59, 5 studies) (p = .02) (i2 = 70%). Low muscle density was not predictive of OS (HR 1.44 95% CI 0.77-2.68, 2 studies) (p = .25) (i2 = 87%). Patients with sarcopenia (56%) had more grade 3-5 toxicity compared to non-sarcopenic (25%) (RR 2.17 95% CI 1.4-3.34, 3 studies) (p = .0005) (i2 = 0%). TTP was nearly 71 days longer in advanced/metastatic patients classified as non-sarcopenic compared to patients with sarcopenia (MD - 70.75 95% CI - 122.32 to - 19.18) (p = .007) (i2 = 0%). CONCLUSION Our synthesis of the literature shows that patients with sarcopenia have more severe chemotherapy toxicity as well as shorter OS and TTP, and that low muscle density is prognostic of OS for women with metastatic breast cancer. Our findings suggest that in clinical practice, body composition assessment is valuable as a prognostic parameter in breast cancer.","Aleixo, G F P; Williams, G R; Nyrop, K A; Muss, H B; Shachar, S S",Breast cancer research and treatment,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10549-019-05352-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31292800/,217

131638,"Africa Succeeded Against COVID-19's First Wave, but the Second Wave Brings New Challenges.",2021-01-06,"INTRODUCTION People with bipolar disorder require long-term treatment but it is estimated that 40% of these people do not adhere to prescribed medication regimens. Non-adherence increases the risk of relapse, hospitalisation and suicide. Some evidence syntheses report barriers to mental health treatment adherence but rarely delineate between modifiable and non-modifiable barriers. They also fail to distinguish between the patients' perspective and that of other stakeholders such as clinicians despite of their different understanding and priorities about adherence. Facilitators of adherence, which are also important for informing adherence intervention design, are also lacking from syntheses and few syntheses focus on medications for bipolar disorder.This systematic review aims to identify modifiable barriers and facilitators (determinants) of medication adherence in bipolar disorder. We also plan to report determinants of medication adherence from perspectives of patients, carers, healthcare professionals and other third parties. A unique feature of this systematic review in the context of mental health is the use of the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) to organise the literature identified determinants of medication adherence. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The protocol adheres to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols and ENhancing Transparency in REporting the synthesis of Qualitative research (ENTREQ) guidelines. This review will include both qualitative and quantitative primary studies exploring determinants of medication adherence in bipolar disorder. We will search the following databases using a preplanned strategy: CINAHL, Cochrane Library (CENTRAL), Embase, LiLACS, Medline, PsychINFO, PubMed without date restrictions.

131714,A Strategy for Management of Electroconvulsive Therapy Patients During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-09-01,"INTRODUCTION Erectile dysfunction (ED) is the most common male sexual disorder that severely impacts the sexual performance and quality of life of men. As the main subtype of ED, psychogenic ED (pED) has been demonstrated to be a genitourinary disease and also associated with alterations in both brain structure and function. However, the scattered neuroimaging evidence from individual studies has not yet been integrated, and the central pathological alterations associated with pED remain unclear. The objective of this systematic review is to integrate and assess the evidence of the impact of pED on brain structure and function. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Five databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, China Biology Medicine Database and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI)) will be systematically searched from inception to 1 October 2019 (the anticipated completion date of this review), with language restricted to English and Chinese. Studies focusing on the structural or functional alterations in patients with pED will be retrieved. The study selection process will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guideline and quality assessment will be conducted with a customised checklist. After data extraction, a qualitative review will be performed to synthesise the structural and functional brain alterations as well as the correlations between the altered cerebral structures and functions and the clinical characteristics of patients with pED. If the collected data make it feasible, an activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis will also be launched. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethical approval is not required as primary data will not be collected. This review will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at conferences.

137193,Impact of urinary incontinence on falls in the older population: 2017 national survey of older Koreans.,2020-06-22,"Hemagglutinin esterases (HEs), closely related envelope glycoproteins in influenza C and corona- and toroviruses, mediate reversible attachment to O-acetylated sialic acids (Sias). They do so by acting both as lectins and as receptor-destroying enzymes, functions exerted by separate protein domains. HE divergence was accompanied by changes in quaternary structure and in receptor and substrate specificity. The selective forces underlying HE diversity and the molecular basis for Sia specificity are poorly understood. Here we present crystal structures of porcine and bovine torovirus HEs in complex with receptor analogs. Torovirus HEs form homodimers with sialate-O-acetylesterase domains almost identical to corresponding domains in orthomyxo- and coronavirus HEs, but with unique lectin sites. Structure-guided biochemical analysis of the esterase domains revealed that a functionally, but not structurally conserved arginine-Sia carboxylate interaction is critical for the binding and positioning of glycosidically bound Sias in the catalytic pocket. Although essential for efficient de-O-acetylation of Sias, this interaction is not required for catalysis nor does it affect substrate specificity. In fact, the distinct preference of the porcine torovirus enzyme for 9-mono- over 7,9-di-O-acetylated Sias can be explained from a single-residue difference with HEs of more promiscuous specificity. Apparently, esterase and lectin pockets coevolved; also the porcine torovirus HE receptor-binding site seems to have been designed to use 9-mono- and exclude di-O-acetylated Sias, possibly as an adaptation to replication in swine. Our findings shed light on HE evolution and provide fundamental insight into mechanisms of substrate binding, substrate recognition, and receptor selection in this important class of virion proteins.","Langereis, Martijn A; Zeng, Qinghong; Gerwig, Gerrit J; Frey, Barbara; von Itzstein, Mark; Kamerling, Johannis P; de Groot, Raoul J; Huizinga, Eric G",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0904266106; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19721004/,217

Patients enrolled in the SWIFT PRIME trial with baseline computed tomography perfusion (CTP) scans were included. RAPID software was used to calculate mean relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) in hypoperfused regions, and hypoperfusion index ratio (HIR). Blind assessments of collaterals were performed using CT angiography in the whole sample and cerebral angiogram in the endovascular group. Reperfusion was assessed on 27-h CTP; infarct volume was assessed on 27-h magnetic resonance imaging/CT scans. Logistic and rank linear regression models were conducted. We included 158 patients. High rCBV ( p = 0.03) and low HIR ( p = 0.03) were associated with good collaterals. A positive association was found between rCBV and better collateral grades on cerebral angiography ( p = 0.01). Baseline and 27-h follow-up CTP were available for 115 patients, of whom 74 (64%) achieved successful reperfusion. Lower rCBV predicted a higher infarct growth in successfully reperfused patients ( p = 0.038) and in the endovascular treatment group ( p = 0.049). Finally, rCBV and HIR may serve as markers of collateral circulation in AIS patients prior to endovascular therapy.

It is controversial whether the virus may be transmitted via tears. Exposed ocular surface can serve as a gateway in transmission and acquiring respiratory diseases. Considering the reported cases on healthcare workers indicating nosocomial transmission and the anatomical and physiological aspects it is perceived that ophthalmic healthcare professionals are at higher risk of contracting the virus by virtue of their job.

Our aim, in the given prospective study was to report our initial clinical experience with TAMIS, and to evaluate its effects on postoperative anorectal functions. MATERIALS AND METHODS In 10 patients treated with TAMIS for benign and malignant rectal tumors, preoperative and postoperative anorectal function was evaluated with anorectal manometry and Cleveland Clinic Incontinence Score. RESULTS The mean distance of the tumors from the anal verge was 5.6 cm, and mean tumor diameter was 2.6 cm. All resection margins were tumor free. There was no difference in preoperative and 3-week postoperative anorectalmanometry findings; only mean minimum rectal sensory volume was lower at 3 weeks after surgery. The Cleveland Clinic Incontinence Score was normal in all patients except one which resolved by 6 weeks after surgery.The mean postoperative follow-up was 28 weeks without any recurrences.

139892,[The Contribution of SARS-CoV-2 Genomics to the Handling of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Portugal].,2021-06-04,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has had a massive impact on human lives worldwide. While the airborne SARS-CoV-2 primarily affects the lungs, viremia is not uncommon. As placental trophoblasts are directly bathed in maternal blood, they are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2. Intriguingly, the human fetus is largely spared from SARS-CoV-2 infection. We tested whether the human placenta expresses the main SARS-CoV-2 entry factors angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), and furin and showed that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed in the trophoblast rather than in other placental villous cells. While furin is expressed in the main placental villous cell types, we surveyed, trophoblasts exhibit the highest expression. In line with the expression of these entry factors, we demonstrated that a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus could enter primary human trophoblasts. Mechanisms underlying placental defense against SARS-CoV-2 infection likely involve postentry processing, which may be germane for mitigating interventions against SARS-CoV-2.IMPORTANCE Pregnant women worldwide have been affected by COVID-19. As the virus is commonly spread to various organs via the bloodstream and because human placental trophoblasts are directly bathed in maternal blood, feto-placental infection by SARS-CoV-2 seems likely. However, despite the heightened risk to pregnant women, thus far the transmission risk of COVID-19 to the feto-placental unit seems extremely low. This has been recently attributed to a negligible expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry factors in the human placenta. We therefore sought to explore the expression of the entry factors ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the different cell types of human placental villi. Using a combination of transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq), real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), in situ hybridization, and immunofluorescence, we found that trophoblasts, but not the other main villous cell types, express ACE2 and TMPRSS2, with a broad expression of furin. Correspondingly, we also showed that primary human trophoblasts are permissive to entry of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus particles.","Ouyang, Yingshi; Bagalkot, Tarique; Fitzgerald, Wendy; Sadovsky, Elena; Chu, Tianjiao; Martínez-Marchal, Ana; Brieño-Enríquez, Miguel; Su, Emily J; Margolis, Leonid; Sorkin, Alexander; Sadovsky, Yoel",mSphere,https://doi.org/10.1128/msphere.00250-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33853873/,217
140453,Restarting elective orthopaedic services during the COVID-19 pandemic: Do patients want to have surgery?,2020-06-01,"Micronutrient deficiencies continue to be widespread among children under-five in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), despite the fact that several effective strategies now exist to prevent them. This kind of malnutrition can have several immediate and long-term consequences, including stunted growth, a higher risk of acquiring infections, and poor development outcomes, all of which may lead to a child not achieving his or her full potential. This review systematically synthesizes the available evidence on the strategies used to prevent micronutrient malnutrition among children under-five in LMICs, including single and multiple micronutrient (MMN) supplementation, lipid-based nutrient supplementation (LNS), targeted and large-scale fortification, and point-of-use-fortification with micronutrient powders (MNPs). We searched relevant databases and grey literature, retrieving 35,924 papers. After application of eligibility criteria, we included 197 unique studies. Of note, we examined the efficacy and effectiveness of interventions. We found that certain outcomes, such as anemia, responded to several intervention types. The risk of anemia was reduced with iron alone, iron-folic acid, MMN supplementation, MNPs, targeted fortification, and large-scale fortification. Stunting and underweight, however, were improved only among children who were provided with LNS, though MMN supplementation also slightly increased length-for-age z-scores. Vitamin A supplementation likely reduced all-cause mortality, while zinc supplementation decreased the incidence of diarrhea. Importantly, many effects of LNS and MNPs held when pooling data from effectiveness studies. Taken together, this evidence further supports the importance of these strategies for reducing the burden of micronutrient malnutrition in children. Population and context should be considered when selecting one or more appropriate interventions for programming.","Tam, Emily; Keats, Emily C; Rind, Fahad; Das, Jai K; Bhutta, And Zulfiqar A",Nutrients,https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12020289; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31973225/,217

Most studies of GL featured short series and no data on the time to reoperation for persistent GL. OBJECTIVES Characterize the time between discovery of persistent post-SG GL and the implementation of reoperation. SETTING University hospital, France, public practice. METHODS All patients treated for post-SG GL between November 2004 and December 2013 were included. The primary efficacy criterion was the time interval between discovery of a persistent GL and reoperation. The secondary efficacy criteria were demographic, surgical, and endoscopic data; mortality rate; time to GL healing; treatment success rate; and risk factors for failure treatment. RESULTS Eighty-six patients were treated for post-SG GL. Forty patients (46.5%) had early-onset GL (postoperative day ≤ 7). Two patients (2.3%) presented primary gastrobronchial fistula. Fifty-six patients (70%) underwent immediate reoperation. Endoscopic treatment was required to treat the GL in 92.7% of the cases (n = 77). The mortality rate was 1.2% (n = 1). The treatment success rate was 89.1%. The median time to healing GL was 84 days (14-423 d). Eighty percent of the GLs had healed 120 days after discovery. After 120 days, the incidence of complications related to GL increased and few additional GLs healed. The only identified risk factor for treatment failure was large retained gastric fundus (P ≤ .05). CONCLUSIONS Most cases of GL can be adequately treated by incorporating endoscopic stenting. Surgery for persistent GL should be performed within 120 days of discovery; after this cut-off, the incidence of GL-related complications increases. Large retained gastric fundus is a risk factor for treatment failure and may prompt the surgeon to consider earlier reoperation.","Rebibo, Lionel; Bartoli, Eric; Dhahri, Abdennaceur; Cosse, Cyril; Robert, Brice; Brazier, Franck; Pequignot, Aurélien; Hakim, Sami; Yzet, Thierry; Delcenserie, Richard; Dupont, Hervé; Regimbeau, Jean-Marc",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soard.2015.04.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26070397/,217

However, the coexistence of both diseases is rare. Common immunological mechanisms with altered T-cell-mediated autoimmunity, cytokine milieu, and Koebner phenomenon play a role in their pathogenesis. As reviewed in the literature, psoriasis may independently be associated with other autoimmune conditions like vitiligo, alopecia areata, LP, and discoid lupus erythematosus. A rare co-occurrence of these two or three autoimmune diseases has been reported. Here, we report a case of a 10-year-old boy who presented with persistent nonpruritic multiple hyperpigmented scaly papules and plaques over the body since 6 months of age. Histopathology revealed features suggestive of both LP and psoriasis in the same section.

141388,Letter to the Editor: Recommendations for the Care of Pediatric Orthopaedic Patients During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-07-22,"The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted medical research, pushing mentors and mentees to decide if COVID-19 research would be germane to the early career investigator's developing research portfolio. With COVID-19 halting hundreds of federal trials involving non-COVID-19 research, mentors and mentees must also consider the broader moral calling of contributing to COVID-19 research. At the time of writing, the National Institutes of Health had responded to the pandemic with significant funding for COVID-19 research. However, because this pandemic is a new phenomenon, few mentors have expertise in the disease and relevant established resources. As a result, many mentors are unable to provide insight on COVID-19 research to early career investigators considering a pivot toward research related to this disease. The authors suggest 4 ways for mentees and mentors to respond to the changes the pandemic has brought to research funding and opportunities: (1) Include COVID-19 research in existing portfolios to diversify intellectual opportunities and reduce funding risks; (2) negotiate the mentor-mentee relationship and roles and expectations early in project discussions-considering, as relevant, the disproportionate burden of home responsibilities often borne by early career faculty members who are women and/or from a minority group; (3) address any mentor limitations in content expertise; and (4) if the decision is to pivot to COVID-19 research, select projects with implications generalizable beyond this pandemic to other infectious outbreaks or to the redesign of health care delivery. Mentors and mentees must weigh the relevance of COVID-19 research projects to the postpandemic world and the amount of available funding against the developing interests of early career investigators. Academic medical centers nationwide must enable seasoned and early career researchers to contribute meaningfully to COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 research.","Gettel, Cameron J; Venkatesh, Arjun K",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,https://doi.org/10.1097/acm.0000000000004076; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33769338/,217

Healthcare-associated infections are considered serious in developing countries, and there are few reports on the hand-hygiene status of these countries. Thus, we evaluated hand-hygiene status in eight hospitals in Cambodia to understand and identify factors hindering effective infection control. METHODOLOGY Eight infection-management instructors working in one of the eight Cambodian government hospitals in a large city were interviewed with the WHO Hand Hygiene Self-Assessment Framework. RESULTS The mean Hand Hygiene Self-Assessment Framework score across the eight hospitals was 177.81 ± 56.73. The overall level of compliance with the multimodal hand hygiene improvement strategy across these eight hospitals was basic-two hospitals scored inadequate and six hospitals scored basic. The scores for the 5 factors of the Hand Hygiene Self-Assessment Framework were as follows: 45.63 ± 15.45 for system change, 33.13 ± 16.89 for education and training, 27.81 ± 21.65 for evaluation and feedback, 58.13 ± 5.30 for reminders in the workplace, and 13.13 ± 11.00 for institutional safety climate for hand hygiene CONCLUSIONS: The promotion of hand hygiene compliance requires the establishment of a basic infrastructure, reinforcement of the hand hygiene education system, and provision of diverse educational materials, as well as the fostering of a professional workforce for education.

142224,Grieving Kairos Moments.,2021-03-01,"Background Thyroid cancer is a very common endocrine cancer worldwide. How long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) regulates thyroid cancer is elusive. LncRNA MFI2-AS1 has been demonstrated to initiate colorectal cancer. Nevertheless, the role of MFI2-AS1 in thyroid cancer remains unknown. This study aims to determine the roles of MFI2-AS1 in thyroid cancer. Methods qRT-PCR was used to determine the expression of MFI2-AS1 in thyroid cancer tissues and cells. Proliferation was determined by using CCK8 and colony formation assays. Transwell assay was utilized to analyze migration and invasion. Luciferase reporter assay was performed to confirm the interaction between MFI2-AS1 and miR-125a-5p. Results MFI2-AS1 was shown to be highly expressed in thyroid cancer tissues and predicted poor prognosis. Knockdown of MFI2-AS1 inhibited proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion of thyroid cancer cells in vitro. Bioinformatics screening identified MFI2-AS1 as the sponge for miR-125a-5p. And miR-125a-5p was further confirmed to target TRIAP1 directly. Our data further demonstrated that MFI2-AS1 promoted TRIAP1 expression via repressing miR-125a-5p. Finally, TRIAP1 was found to be upregulated in thyroid cancer tissues and its restoration reversed the effects of MFI2-AS1 depletion. Conclusion Our results elucidated a novel mechanism that MFI2-AS1 promotes thyroid cancer progression via the miR-125a-5p/TRIAP1 pathway.","Yu, Tianyu; Tong, Lingling; Ao, Yu; Zhang, Genmao; Liu, Yunpeng; Zhang, Hejia",OncoTargets and therapy,https://doi.org/10.2147/ott.s236476; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764987/,217
142274,Low Incidence of Asymptomatic Positive Patients Detected During Preoperative Testing for Total Joint Arthroplasty During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2021-02-04,"BACKGROUND Respiratory viral infections can become epidemic due to high contagiosity. Since there was no rapid diagnostic method for complete diagnosis in the past, diagnosis was solely made on the basis of clinical symptoms or the time of infection. With recent developments in rapid diagnostic methods like multiplex reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR, R-mix virus culture, etc., early detection and effective treatment of respiratory viral infections is possible. Herein, we compared the efficiency of multiplex RT-PCR and the R-mix virus culture for the rapid detection of respiratory viruses. METHODS We used 96 nasopharyngeal swab specimens for culturing respiratory viruses using R-mix (Diagnostics Hybrids Inc., USA). Afterwards, multiplex RT-PCR was performed using specimens stored at -70 degrees C. RESULTS R-mix virus culture yielded positive results in 34 cases (35.4%) and multiplex RT-PCR in 73 cases (76.0%). Both methods yielded identical results in 51 cases (29 positive cases and 22 negative cases). Among 45 cases that showed different results, 40 showed negative results in R-mix virus culture and positive results in multiplex RT-PCR, and 1 showed positive result in R-mix virus culture and negative result in multiplex RT-PCR. Different viruses were detected in the remaining 4 cases by both the methods. CONCLUSIONS Multiplex RT-PCR provided faster results and had higher detection rates than R-mix virus culture. Further, unlike R-mix virus culture, multiplex RT-PCR can be used to identify new respiratory viruses. Therefore, multiplex RT-PCR is more useful than R-mix virus culture in the diagnosis of respiratory virus infection.","Lim, Gayoung; Park, Tae Sung; Suh, Jin Tae; Lee, Hee Joo",The Korean journal of laboratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.3343/kjlm.2010.30.3.289; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20603590/,217
142339,"COVID-19 Pandemic, Corona Viruses, and Diabetes Mellitus.",2020-03-31,"INTRODUCTION There is uncertainty over the optimal level of systolic blood pressure (SBP) in the setting of acute ischemic stroke (AIS). The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of the early manipulation of SBP in non-thrombolised patients. The key hypothesis under investigation was that clinical outcomes vary across ranges of SBP in AIS. METHODS 218 patients were randomized within 12 h of AIS to maintain the SBP during 24 h within three ranges: Group 1 140-160 mmHg, Group 2 161-180 mmHg or Group 3 181-200 mmHg. Vasoactive drugs and fluids were used to achieve these targets. Good outcome was defined as a modified Rankin score 0-2 at 90-days. RESULTS The median SBP in the three groups in 24 h was: 153 mmHg, 163 mmHg, and 178 mmHg, respectively, P < 0.0001. Good clinical outcome did not differ among the different groups (51% vs 52% vs 39%, P = 0.27). Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (SICH) was more frequent in the higher SBP range (1% vs 2.7% vs 9.1%, P = 0.048) with similar mortality rates. No patient had acute neurological deterioration related to the SBP reduction in the first 24 h. In our logistic regression analysis, the odds of having good clinical outcome was higher in Group 2 (OR 2.83) after adjusting for important confounders. Regardless of the assigned group, the probability of good outcome was 47% in patients who were manipulated to increase the BP, 42% to decrease and 62% in non-manipulated (P = 0.1). Adverse effects were limited to Group 2 (4%) and Group 3 (7.6%) and were associated with the use of norepinephrine (P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Good outcome in 90 days was not significantly different among the 3 blood pressure ranges. After logistic regression analysis, the odds of having good outcome was greater in Group 2 (SBP 161-180 mmHg). SICH occurred more frequently in Group 3 (181-200 mmHg).","Nasi, Luiz Antonio; Martins, Sheila Cristina Ouriques; Gus, Miguel; Weiss, Gustavo; de Almeida, Andrea Garcia; Brondani, Rosane; Rebello, Letícia Costa; DalPizzol, Angélica; Fuchs, Flávio Danni; Valença, Maria Júlia Monteiro; Wirth, Letícia F; Nunes, Gerson; Anderson, Craig S",Neurocritical care,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12028-018-0642-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30460598/,217

PATIENTS AND METHODS The expression of lncRNA-URHC in tissues and cells was tested by Real-time quantitative PCR. The expression of lncRNA-URHC was down-regulated by RNA interference (siRNA). The Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was used to detect the interference efficiency. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), flow cytometry, and transwell were used to detect the effect of lncRNA-URHC on the proliferation, apoptosis and invasion of colorectal cancer cells. The effect of lncRNA-URHC on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related markers was detected by Western blot. RESULTS LncRNA-URHC expression was significantly increased in colorectal cancer cells compared with normal cells, and the expression of lncRNA-URHC in colorectal cancer cells was higher than that in the normal cell. After down-regulated the expression of lncRNA-URHC, the proliferation and invasion of colorectal cancer cells were decreased, while cells apoptosis was promoted. Down-regulation of lncRNA-URHC could enhance the expression of E-cadherin and reduce the expression of N-cadherin, vimentin and snail.

Here we examine whether the particular genetic variants can lead to increased susceptibility to PJI development. RESULTS We conducted a genetic-association study to determine whether PJI could be associated with functional cytokine gene polymorphisms (CGP) influencing on innate immunity response. A case-control design was utilized and previously published criteria for PJI were included to distinguish between cases and control subjects with/without TJA. Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in the genes for interleukin-1beta (SNP: IL1B-511, +3962), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-308, -238) and interleukin-6 (IL6-174, nt565) were genotyped in 303 Caucasian (Czech) patients with TJA (89 with PJI / 214 without PJI), and 168 unrelated healthy Czech individuals without TJA. The results showed that carriers of the less common IL1B-511*T allele were overrepresented in the group of TJA patients with PJI (69%) in comparison with those that did not develop PJI (51%, p = 0.006, p(corr) = 0.037) and with healthy controls (55%, p = 0.04, p(corr) = N.S.). There was no significant difference in the distribution of the remaining five investigated CGPs and their haplotypes between groups. CONCLUSION A functional variant of the gene encoding for IL-1beta was preliminarily nominated as a genetic factor contributing to the susceptibility to PJI. Our results should be independently replicated; studies on the functional relevance of IL1B gene variants in PJI are also needed.","Stahelova, Anna; Mrazek, Frantisek; Smizansky, Matej; Petrek, Martin; Gallo, Jiri",BMC immunology,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2172-13-25; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22568934/,217

Many patients are dependent on a lifetime of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions and iron chelation therapy. Although treatments have a significant impact on quality of life (QoL), life expectancy and long-term health outcomes have improved in recent decades through safer RBC transfusion practices and better iron chelation strategies. Advances in the understanding of the pathology of β-thalassemia have led to the development of new treatment options that have the potential to reduce the RBC transfusion burden in patients with transfusion-dependent (TD) β-thalassemia and improve QoL. AREAS COVERED This review provides an overview of currently available treatments for patients with TD β-thalassemia, highlighting QoL issues, and providing an update on current clinical experience plus important practical points for two new treatments available for TD β-thalassemia: betibeglogene autotemcel (beti-cel) gene therapy and the erythroid maturation agent luspatercept, an activin ligand trap. EXPERT OPINION : Approved therapies, including curative gene therapies and supportive treatments such as luspatercept, have the potential to reduce RBC transfusion burden, and improve clinical outcomes and QoL in patients with TD β-thalassemia.

METHODS Database review occurred for patients seen between 1997-2020 at the Emory ALS Center in Atlanta, Georgia. ALS patients were included for analyses if race was self-reported as black or white and symptom onset was prior to 1/1/2017. Variables examined include race, age of onset, diagnostic delay, site of onset, median income, C9orf72 mutation status, feeding tube and tracheostomy status, vital capacity, ALSFRS-R, and survival time. RESULTS 2363 patient records were queried, and 1298 were included in analysis; 203 self-identified as black and 1095 as white. Black patients had younger age of symptom onset, lower frequency of C9orf72 mutations, lower median income, longer diagnostic delay, and lower baseline ALSFRS-R and vital capacity compared to white patients. Black patients had a longer median survival than white patients; however race was not an independent predictor of survival time when controlling for age of symptom onset, bulbar onset, and C9orf72 positivity. CONCLUSIONS Black patients with ALS showed longer median survival compared to white patients, however race was not independently associated with survival after controlling for age, site of onset, and C9orf72 status, factors known to predict prognosis. Black patients with ALS had longer diagnostic delay and lower baseline ventilatory and functional status at first their clinic visit compared to white patients, which could be suggestive of barriers to tertiary care.

148242,Migration health research and policy in south and south-east Asia: mapping the gaps and advancing a collaborative agenda.,2020-09-01,"PURPOSE The United States has experienced a surge of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Regardless of the overall increase in the prevalence and mortality, there are disagreements about the consequences of exposure and contracting COVID-19, specifically in rural areas. Rural areas have inherent characteristics that increase their vulnerability to contracting COVID-19. The objective of this study was to investigate the differences in death rates from COVID-19 between urban and rural areas in the United States. METHODS This study used county-level data. The data set consisted of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths along with county-level demographics. The sample consisted of all counties in the 50 US states and DC. Counties were designated as metropolitan, micropolitan, and rural. A zero-inflated negative binomial regression was used to estimate county-level number of deaths conditional on contracting COVID-19. The study focused on COVID-19-related mortality from February 10, 2020, to June 12, 2020. FINDINGS After controlling for county-level characteristics, the rate of COVID-19 deaths was 70.3% (P < .001) for rural counties and 53.4% (P < .001) for micropolitan counties, both significantly lower than metropolitan counties during the study time period. CONCLUSION Over time, rural geography and social isolation may not provide sustainable protection to rural residents from the pandemic. The slow progression provides rural areas additional time and opportunity to learn from the experiences in urban areas that were most affected.

The quantified bioactive compounds were two isoforms of vitamin E highlighting α-tocopherol (3370.35 mg/100 g dry weight (DW) and ergosterol (11.70 mg/100 g DW). The total phenolic content was 164.80 mg gallic acid equivalents/100 g and nine phenolic compounds were identified (protocatechuic, p -hydroxybenzoic, caffeic, vanillic, ferulic, salicylic, p -anisic, t -cinnamic acids, and scopoletin). The highest antioxidant capacity was detected in the lipophilic extract with TEAC (27688 µmoles Trolox equivalents/100 g). These results suggest that lipophilic compounds are among the main bioactive compounds in N. lepideus and they might exhibit the highest radical scavenging properties in non-polar extracts.","Quintero-Cabello, Karen P; Palafox-Rivera, Patricia; Lugo-Flores, Marco A; Gaitan-Hernandez, Rigoberto; Gaitan-Hernandez, Rigoberto; González-Aguilar, Gustavo A; Silva-Espinoza, Brenda A; Tortoledo-Ortiz, Orlando; Ayala-Zavala, J Fernando; Monribot-Villanueva, Juan L; Guerrero-Analco, José A",Chemistry & biodiversity,https://doi.org/10.1002/cbdv.202100085; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34046999/,217
148683,Systematic reviews of ten pharmaceutical pricing policies - a research protocol.,2020,"With a lot of uncertainty, unclear, and frequently changing management protocols, COVID-19 has significantly impacted the orthopaedic surgical practice during this pandemic crisis. Surgeons around the world needed closed introspection, contemplation, and prospective consensual recommendations for safe surgical practice and prevention of viral contamination. One hundred orthopaedic surgeons from 50 countries were sent a Google online form with a questionnaire explicating protocols for admission, surgeries, discharge, follow-up, relevant information affecting their surgical practices, difficulties faced, and many more important issues that happened during and after the lockdown. Ten surgeons critically construed and interpreted the data to form rationale guidelines and recommendations. Of the total, hand and microsurgery surgeons (52%), trauma surgeons (32%), joint replacement surgeons (20%), and arthroscopy surgeons (14%) actively participated in the survey. Surgeons from national public health care/government college hospitals (44%) and private/semiprivate practitioners (54%) were involved in the study. Countries had lockdown started as early as January 3, 2020 with the implementation of partial or complete lifting of lockdown in few countries while writing this article. Surgeons (58%) did not stop their surgical practice or clinics but preferred only emergency cases during the lockdown. Most of the surgeons (49%) had three-fourths reduction in their total patients turn-up and the remaining cases were managed by conservative (54%) methods. There was a 50 to 75% reduction in the number of surgeries. Surgeons did perform emergency procedures without COVID-19 tests but preferred reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR; 77%) and computed tomography (CT) scan chest (12%) tests for all elective surgical cases. Open fracture and emergency procedures (60%) and distal radius (55%) fractures were the most commonly performed surgeries. Surgeons preferred full personal protection equipment kits (69%) with a respirator (N95/FFP3), but in the case of unavailability, they used surgical masks and normal gowns. Regional/local anesthesia (70%) remained their choice for surgery to prevent the aerosolized risk of contaminations. Essential surgical follow-up with limited persons and visits was encouraged by 70% of the surgeons, whereas teleconsultation and telerehabilitation by 30% of the surgeons. Despite the protective equipment, one-third of the surgeons were afraid of getting infected and 56% feared of infecting their near and dear ones. Orthopaedic surgeons in private practice did face 50 to 75% financial loss and have to furlough 25% staff and 50% paramedical persons. Orthopaedics meetings were cancelled, and virtual meetings have become the preferred mode of sharing the knowledge and experiences avoiding human contacts. Staying at home, reading, and writing manuscripts became more interesting and an interesting lifestyle change is seen among the surgeons. Unanimously and without any doubt all accepted the fact that COVID-19 pandemic has reached an unprecedented level where personal hygiene, hand washing, social distancing, and safe surgical practices are the viable antidotes, and they have all slowly integrated these practices into their lives. Strict adherence to local authority recommendations and guidelines, uniform and standardized norms for admission, inpatient, and discharge, mandatory RT-PCR tests before surgery and in selective cases with CT scan chest, optimizing and regularizing the surgeries, avoiding and delaying nonemergency surgeries and follow-up protocols, use of teleconsultations cautiously, and working in close association with the World Health Organization and national health care systems will provide a conducive and safe working environment for orthopaedic surgeons and their fraternity and also will prevent the resurgence of COVID-19.","Jerome, J Terrence Jose; Mercier, Francisco; Mudgal, Chaitanya S; Arenas-Prat, Joan; Vinagre, Gustavo; Goorens, Chul Ki; Rivera-Chavarría, Ignacio J; Sechachalam, Sreedharan; Mofikoya, Bolaji; Thoma, Achilleas; Medina, Claudia; Henry, Mark; Afshar, Ahmadreza; Dailiana, Zoe H; Prasetyono, Theddeus O H; Artiaco, Stefano; Madhusudhan, Thayur R; Ukaj, Skender; Reigstad, Ole; Hamada, Yoshitaka; Bedi, Rajesh; Poggetti, Andrea; Al-Qattan, Mohammad Manna; Siala, Mahdi; Viswanathan, Anand; Romero-Reveron, Rafael; Hong, Joon Pio; Khalid, Kamarul Ariffin; Bhaskaran, Shivashankar; Venkatadass, Krishnamoorthy; Leechavengvongs, Somsak; Goorens, Chul Ki; Nazim, Sifi; Georgescu, Alexandru Valentin; Tremp, Mathias; Nakarmi, Kiran K; Ellabban, Mohamed A; Chan, Pingtak; Aristov, Andrey; Patel, Sandeep; Moreno-Serrano, Constanza L; Rai, Shwetabh; Kanna, Rishi Mugesh; Malshikare, Vijay A; Tanabe, Katsuhisa; Thomas, Simon; Gokkus, Kemal; Baek, Seung-Hoon; Brandt, Jerker; Rith, Yin; Olazabal, Alfredo; Saaiq, Muhammad; Patil, Vijay; Jithendran, N; Parekh, Harshil; Minamikawa, Yoshitaka; Atagawi, Abdulljawad Almabrouk; Hadi, Jalal Ahmed; Berezowsky, Claudia Arroyo; Moya-Angeler, Joaquin; Altamirano-Cruz, Marco Antonio; Galvis R, Luz Adriana; Antezana, Alex; Paczesny, Lukasz; Fernandes, Carlos Henrique; Asadullah, Md; Yuan-Shun, Lo; Makelov, Biser; Dodakundi, Chaitanya; Regmi, Rabindra; Pereira, Ganarlo Urquizo; Zhang, Shuwei; Sayoojianadhan, Binoy; Callupe, Ivan; Rakha, Mohamed I; Papes, Dino; Ganesan, Ramesh Prabu; Mohan, Mukesh; Jeyaraman, Arun; Prabhakar, Ponnaian; Rajniashokan, Arungeethayan; Geethan, I; Chandrasekar, Sugavanam; Löw, Steffen; Thangavelu, Kannan; Giudici, Luca Dei; Palanisamy, Yuvarajan; Vaidyanathan, Singaravadivelu; Boretto, Jorge; Ramirez, Monica Alexandra; Goundar, Thirumalaisamy Subbiah; Kuppusamy, Thirumavalavan; Kanniyan, Kalaivanan; Srivastava, Atul; Chiu, Yung-Cheng; Bhat, Anil K; Gopinath, Nalli R; Vasudevan, Vijayaraghavan P; Abraham, Vineet",Journal of hand and microsurgery,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1713964; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33408440/,217

152352,"Updates on Heat Stroke, Carbon Monoxide, and Muscle Cramping.",2020-11-01,"The C-type lectin receptor DC-SIGN is a pattern recognition receptor expressed on macrophages and dendritic cells. It has been identified as a promiscuous entry receptor for many pathogens, including epidemic and pandemic viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, Ebola virus, and HIV-1. In the context of the recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, DC-SIGN-mediated virus dissemination and stimulation of innate immune responses has been implicated as a potential factor in the development of severe COVID-19. Inhibition of virus binding to DC-SIGN, thus, represents an attractive host-directed strategy to attenuate overshooting innate immune responses and prevent the progression of the disease. In this study, we report on the discovery of a new class of potent glycomimetic DC-SIGN antagonists from a focused library of triazole-based mannose analogues. Structure-based optimization of an initial screening hit yielded a glycomimetic ligand with a more than 100-fold improved binding affinity compared to methyl α-d-mannopyranoside. Analysis of binding thermodynamics revealed an enthalpy-driven improvement of binding affinity that was enabled by hydrophobic interactions with a loop region adjacent to the binding site and displacement of a conserved water molecule. The identified ligand was employed for the synthesis of multivalent glycopolymers that were able to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein binding to DC-SIGN-expressing cells, as well as DC-SIGN-mediated trans-infection of ACE2+ cells by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-expressing viruses, in nanomolar concentrations. The identified glycomimetic ligands reported here open promising perspectives for the development of highly potent and fully selective DC-SIGN-targeted therapeutics for a broad spectrum of viral infections.","Cramer, Jonathan; Lakkaichi, Adem; Aliu, Butrint; Jakob, Roman P; Klein, Sebastian; Cattaneo, Ivan; Jiang, Xiaohua; Rabbani, Said; Schwardt, Oliver; Zimmer, Gert; Ciancaglini, Matias; Abreu Mota, Tiago; Maier, Timm; Ernst, Beat",Journal of the American Chemical Society,https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.1c06778; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34652144/,217
152682,Impact of COVID-19 shelter-in-place order on transmission of gastrointestinal pathogens in Northern California.,2021-04-12,"The effect of salt on the electrostatic interaction of a protein is an important issue, because addition of salt affects protein stability and association/aggregation. Although adding salt is a generally recognized strategy to improve protein stability, this improvement does not necessarily occur. The lack of an effect upon the addition of salt was previously confirmed for the tenth fibronectin type III domain from human fibronectin (FN3) by thermal stability analysis. However, the detailed molecular mechanism is unknown. In the present study, by employing the negatively charged carboxyl triad on the surface of FN3 as a case study, the molecular mechanism of the inefficient NaCl effect on protein stability was experimentally addressed using spectroscopic methods. Complementary analysis using Raman spectroscopy and 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid fluorescence revealed the three-phase behavior of the salt-protein interaction between NaCl and FN3 over a wide salt concentration range from 100 mM to 4.0 M, suggesting that the Na+-specific binding to the negatively charged carboxyl triad causes a local conformational change around the binding site with an accompanying structural change in the overall protein, which contributes to the protein's structural destabilization. This spectroscopic evidence clarifies the molecular understanding of the inefficiency of salt to improve protein stability. The findings will inform the optimization of formulation conditions.","Ota, Chikashi; Fukuda, Yui; Tanaka, Shun-Ichi; Takano, Kazufumi",Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c02367; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33197316/,217
153322,Challenges to scientific publishing in times of COVID-19.,2020-06-01,"Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are one of the original twelve classes of toxic chemicals covered by the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POP), an international environmental treaty signed in 2001. PCBs are present in the environment as mixtures of multiple isomers at different degree of chlorination. These compounds are manmade and possess useful industrial properties including extreme longevity under harsh conditions, heat absorbance, and the ability to form an oily liquid at room temperature that is useful for electrical utilities and in other industrial applications. They have been widely used for a wide range of industrial purposes over the decades. Despite a ban in production in 1979 in the US and many other countries, they remain persistent and ubiquitous in environment as contaminants due to their improper disposal. Humans, independent of where they live, are therefore exposed to PCBs, which are routinely found in random surveys of human and animal tissues. The prolonged exposures to PCBs have been associated with the development of different diseases and disorders, and they are classified as endocrine disruptors. Due to its ability to interact with thyroid hormone, metabolism and function, they are thought to be implicated in the global rise of obesity diabetes, and their potential toxicity for neurodevelopment and disorders, an example of gene by environmental interaction (GxE). The current review is primarily intended to summarize the evidence for the association of PCB exposures with increased risks for metabolic dysfunctions and neurobehavioral disorders. In particular, we present evidence of gene expression alterations in PCB-exposed populations to construct the underlying pathways that may lead to those diseases and disorders in course of life. We conclude the review with future perspectives on biomarker-based research to identify susceptible individuals and populations.","Simhadri, Jyothirmai J; Loffredo, Christopher A; Trnovec, Tomas; Murinova, Lubica Palkovicova; Nunlee-Bland, Gail; Koppe, Janna G; Schoeters, Greet; Jana, Siddhartha Sankar; Ghosh, Somiranjan",Environmental research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.110211; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937175/,217

He presented with a PSA of 3.3 and was diagnosed with Gleason 3 + 4 prostate cancer. An extra peritoneal approach was chosen due to his body habitus and to avoid extreme Trendelenburg tilt. Side docking with the da Vinci robot was employed and the prostatectomy was carried out in the standard extra peritoneal fashion. At 6 months' follow-up his PSA is unrecordable and he is voiding well with minimal urinary incontinence, requiring 1 pad/day.

The authors assessed subjects retrospectively for cardiac and liver injury, shock, ventilation, mortality, and viral clearance. Corticosteroids in severe COVID-19 related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was associated with increased mortality and delayed viral clearance. Here, we consider how to reconcile the negative effects of corticosteroids revealed by Liu and Zhang et al. with the favorable effects (reduced mortality) that were described in the RECOVERY trial.

Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus, resulting in a lethal systemic granulomatous disease called feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), which is one of the most important fatal infectious diseases of cats worldwide. No specific vaccines or drugs have been approved to treat FIP. CoV main proteases (M(pro)s) play a pivotal role in viral transcription and replication, making them an ideal target for drug development. Here, we report the crystal structure of FIPV M(pro) in complex with dual inhibitors, a zinc ion and a Michael acceptor. The complex structure elaborates a unique mechanism of two distinct inhibitors synergizing to inactivate the protease, providing a structural basis to design novel antivirals and suggesting the potential to take advantage of zinc as an adjunct therapy against CoV-associated diseases. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses (CoVs) have the largest genome size among all RNA viruses. CoV infection causes various diseases in humans and animals, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). No approved specific drugs or vaccinations are available to treat their infections. Here, we report a novel dual inhibition mechanism targeting CoV main protease (M(pro)) from feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), which leads to lethal systemic granulomatous disease in cats. M(pro), conserved across all CoV genomes, is essential for viral replication and transcription. We demonstrated that zinc ion and a Michael acceptor-based peptidomimetic inhibitor synergistically inactivate FIPV M(pro). We also solved the structure of FIPV M(pro) complexed with two inhibitors, delineating the structural view of a dual inhibition mechanism. Our study provides new insight into the pharmaceutical strategy against CoV M(pro) through using zinc as an adjuvant therapy to enhance the efficacy of an irreversible peptidomimetic inhibitor.","Wang, Fenghua; Chen, Cheng; Liu, Xuemeng; Yang, Kailin; Xu, Xiaoling; Yang, Haitao",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02685-15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26656689/,217

One month later, the intubation time was longer using the C-MAC (41 (29.5-52 [20-119])s; p = 0.002) and A.P. Advance (40 (28.5-57.5 [21-107])s; p = 0.0003)m compared with the Macintosh (27 (21-29 [16-90])s); there was no difference using the Airtraq (27 (20.5-32.5 [15-94])s; p = 0.258) compared with the Macintosh. While skill acquisition after a brief period of learning and practice was equal for each laryngoscope, performance levels differed after 1 month without practice.

Although the successful experience in Macao SAR, China, may not be generalized to other regions, it should not be unreasonable to be well prepared with sufficient logistic support to conduct timely containment and early detection of episodic cases to prevent the backsliding of COVID-19 outbreak.","Lio, Chon Fu; Cheong, Hou Hon; Lei, Chin Ion; Lo, Iek Long; Lam, Chong; Leong, Iek Hou",World journal of clinical cases,https://doi.org/10.12998/wjcc.v8.i13.2674; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32742979/,217
160343,How to restore medical services in the ophthalmic department in the post-pandemic period of COVID-19.,2021-02-01,"BACKGROUND Whether the efficacy and safety of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) are uniform between sexes is unclear. We sought to compare clinical outcomes between short- (≤6 months) versus long-term (≥1 year) DAPT after drug-eluting stent (DES) placement in women and men. METHODS AND RESULTS We pooled individual patient data from 6 randomized trials of DAPT (EXCELLENT, OPTIMIZE, PRODIGY, RESET, SECURITY, ITALIC PLUS). The primary outcome was 1-year risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE). The main secondary outcome was 1-year risk of any bleeding. Out of the 11,473 randomized patients included in the pooled dataset, 3,454 (30%) were females. At 1-year follow-up, women had higher risk of MACE (3.6% vs. 2.8%; P = 0.01) but similar risk of bleeding (1.9% vs. 1.6%; P = 0.16) as compared with men. Compared with long-term DAPT, short-term DAPT was associated with similar rates of MACE in both women (HR 0.88; 95% CI 0.62-1.25) and men (HR 1.25; 95% CI 0.95-1.6; P interaction = 0.08)]. At 1-year follow-up, short-term DAPT was associated with lower rates of bleeding as compared with long-term DAPT in both women (HR 0.84; 95% CI 0.51-1.37) and men (HR 0.58; 95% CI 0.40-0.84; P-interaction = 0.25). The presence of MVD was associated with higher MACE rates in the short-term DAPT group in women (HR: 1.16; CI 0.60-2.23) and men (HR: 2.29; CI 1.22-4.29; P interaction = 0.25). CONCLUSIONS Short-term DAPT is associated with similar rates of MACE but lower risk of bleeding when as compared with prolonged DAPT. There was no significant difference between sexes in the population studied. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Sawaya, Fadi J; Morice, Marie-Claude; Spaziano, Marco; Mehran, Roxana; Didier, Romain; Roy, Andrew; Valgimigli, Marco; Kim, Hyo-Soo; Woo Park, Kyung; Hong, Myeong-Ki; Kim, Byeong-Keuk; Jang, Yangsoo; Feres, Fausto; Abizaid, Alexandre; Costa, Ricardo A; Colombo, Antonio; Chieffo, Alaide; Giustino, Gennaro; Stone, Gregg W; Bhatt, Deepak L; Palmerini, Tullio; Gilard, Martine",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.26653; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27426936/,217

167181,A cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) approach for working with strong feelings of guilt after traumatic events,2021,"The debate about the ‘just price’ has ancient origin and returns forcefully to the scene when, in the event of crises of various kinds, there is a rapid and significant increase in prices of given goods or services. The main issue is whether price increases of such a nature could, or should, be considered illicit and ground the issue of sanctions against the firms increasing prices, thus focusing on a macro-systemic level of analysis. The central part of the article reviews different theories on what a ‘just price’ should be and focuses on the idea that a price is ‘just’ when it functions as an index of relative scarcity in free markets. It is claimed that such a function deserves protection by Italian and EU law. Therefore price adjustments in response to shocks cannot and should not be considered illegal: it is unacceptable to sanction private firms by attributing them the wrong of not having substituted themselves, at their own expense, for the exercise of a public function (that of making sure that price increases do not put at risk solidarity and other constitutional principles). Le débat sur le juste prix est d’origine ancienne mais revient itérativement sur les devants de la scène lorsqu’à l’occasion de crises de diverses sortes, il y a une augmentation significative du prix de certains biens ou services. La question principale est de savoir si de telles augmentations devraient ou pourraient être considérées comme étant illicites et entraîne à son tour celle du fondement de sanctions éventuelles contre les firmes qui y procèdent, plaçant le débat sur le terrain de la macro-analyse économique. La partie centrale de cet article revisite diverses théories relatives à la détermination du juste prix et identifie parmi elles le critère du juste prix comme étant celui qui signale la rareté dans des marchés non régulés. Il est donc soutenu que cette fonction de signalement devrait être protégée par le droit italien comme par le droit de l’Union. Par conséquent, les ajustements de prix en réponse aux crises ne devraient pas être tenus pour illicites. Il est inacceptable de sanctionner des entreprises privées en leur imputant la faute de ne pas s’être substituées, à leur propre dépens, au régulateur public, qui doit s’assurer que les marchés ne mettent pas en risque la solidarité sociale ou d’autres principes constitutionnels. Die Diskussion zum Thema ‘iustum pretium’ (gerechter Preis) hat alte Wurzeln, nimmt jedoch heute wieder mächtig Momentum auf, namentlich, wenn in den verschiedensten Krisen Preise für bestimmte Güter oder Dienstleistungen erheblich anziehen. Die Hauptfrage geht dahin, ob solchermaßen ausgelöste Preissprünge als illegitim gesehen werden können oder sollen, mit anderen Worten: eine Frage, die vor allem makro-systemisch zu sehen ist. Im Kernstück des Beitrages werden verschiedene Theorien analysiert, was denn als ‘gerechter Preis’ zu sehen ist. Besondere Aufmerksamkeit wird der Auffassung gewidmet, dass Preise die richtigen Indikatoren für relative Knappheit in freien Märkten bilden sollten. Das Argument geht dahin, dass diese Funktion von Preisen in der Tat im EU-Recht und auch beispielsweise im italienischen Recht geschützt bzw. vorausgesetzt wird. Daher sollte eine Reaktion auf Preisschocks nicht per se als illegal oder illegitim eingestuft werden. Private Unternehmen sollten nicht dafür “bestraft” werden, dass sie nicht auf eigene Kosten Vorsorge für etwas getroffen haben, was als Staatsaufgabe verstanden werden sollte (namentlich, dass gewährleistet wird, dass Preisentwicklungen nicht im Widerspruch zu verfassungsrechtlichen Grundprinzipien, etwa dem der Solidarität, stehen).","Marchisio, Emiliano",European Review of Contract Law,https://doi.org/10.1515/ercl-2021-2026,217

The rapidity of spread and the enormous burden placed on public health infrastructure by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has forced researchers to look for quick answers for therapy. Drug repurposing is probably the quickest way to develop an effective therapy in a very short time. With additional input from artificial intelligence (AI), drug repurposing may emerge as one of the major techniques by which humanity can overcome this as well as future challenges.

168856,Neuropsychiatric disorders and COVID-19,2021,"Relevance. Currently, the incidence of COVID-19 is growing in many countries of the world, including Russia. There are suggestions about a likely protective role against the new coronavirus infection of widely used traditional vaccines against respiratory infections (influenza, tuberculosis, pneumococcal infection). Those vaccinated with these vaccines are less likely to report deaths and severe forms of COVID-19 diseases in vulnerable populations. The aim is to determine the frequency of detection of positive markers of a new coronavirus infection in individuals with different vaccination histories. Materials and methods. We examined 313 employees of an educational institution with various vaccination histories at the age of 20–54 years from May to September 2020. The determination of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and specific IgM and IgG antibodies to the virus nucleocapsid was carried out. Results. Positive markers for SARS-CoV-2 (PCR and / or ELISA) were found in 51 (16.3%) people. All examined patients had no signs of acute respiratory viral infections. Among people with positive markers of coronavirus infection (PCR and / or ELISA), the number of people vaccinated against diphtheria, tetanus, measles and hepatitis B (HBV) was 13.7–17.6% of those examined. Among those with negative PCR results, the number of people vaccinated against these infections was higher (p ≤ 0.05) and amounted to 51.0– 56.6%. Similar results were found in the determination of specific IgM and IgG. Conclusion. Positive markers of a new coronavirus infection were found much less frequently in persons who had a history of vaccination with ADS-M-toxoid, measles and hepatitis B vaccines. © 2021, Numikom.

169479,The Challenges Faced by Allottees of Medical and Dental Postgraduate Programs during Admission: A Questionnaire-based Survey Study,2021,"We present a study of the Corona Borealis (CB) supercluster. We determined the high-density cores of the CB and the richest galaxy clusters in them, and studied their dynamical state and galaxy content. We determined filaments in the supercluster to analyse the connectivity of clusters. We compared the mass distribution in the CB with predictions from the spherical collapse model and analysed the acceleration field in the CB. We found that at a radius $R_{\mathrm{30}}$ around clusters in the CB (A2065, A2061, A2089, and Gr2064) (corresponding to the density contrast $\Delta\rho \approx 30$), the galaxy distribution shows a minimum. The $R_{30}$ values for individual clusters lie in the range of $3 - 6$ $h^{-1}$ Mpc. The radii of the clusters (splashback radii) lie in the range of $R_{\mathrm{cl}} \approx 2 - 3$ $R_{\mathrm{vir}}$. The projected phase space diagrams and the comparison with the spherical collapse model suggest that $R_{\mathrm{30}}$ regions have passed turnaround and are collapsing. Galaxy content in clusters varies strongly. The cluster A2061 has the highest fraction of galaxies with old stellar populations, and A2065 has the highest fraction of galaxies with young stellar populations. The number of long filaments near clusters vary from one at A2089 to five at A2061. During the future evolution, the clusters in the main part of the CB may merge and form one of the largest bound systems in the nearby Universe. Another part of the CB, with the cluster Gr2064, will form a separate system. The structures with a current density contrast $\Delta\rho \approx 30$ have passed turnaround and started to collapse at redshifts $z \approx 0.3 - 0.4$. The comparison of the number and properties of the most massive collapsing supercluster cores from observations and simulations may serve as a test for cosmological models.","Einasto, Maret; Kipper, Rain; Tenjes, Peeter; Lietzen, Heidi; Tempel, Elmo; Liivamagi, Lauri Juhan; Einasto, Jaan; Tamm, Antti; Heinamaki, Pekka; Nurmi, Pasi",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.02326v2.pdf,217

An established multi-site remote patient monitoring (RPM) service was rapidly adapted to support a novel, interdisciplinary COVID-19 program for outpatient management of patients at high-risk for severe illness. The goal of this study was to assess the impact of the RPM program on clinical outcomes and acute care utilization in cancer patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Methods: This is a crosssectional analysis following a multi-site prospective observational study performed at Mayo Clinic Cancer Center (MCCC). All adult patients with active cancer - defined as currently receiving cancer-directed therapy or in recent remission on active surveillance - and PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between March 18 and July 31, 2020 were included. RPM was comprised of in-home technology to assess symptoms and physiologic data with centralized nurse and physician oversight. Results: During the study timeframe 224 cancer patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 at MCCC. Initial management included urgent hospitalization (within 48 hours of diagnosis) in 34 patients (15%). Of the remaining 190 patients (85%) initially managed in the outpatient setting, those who did not receive RPM were significantly more likely to experience hospitalization than those receiving RPM (OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.036 to 12.01, P = 0.044). Following balancing of patient characteristics by inverse propensity weighting, rates of hospital admission for RPM and non-RPM patients were 3.1% and 11% respectively, implying that RPM was associated with an 8% reduction in hospital admission rate (-0.077;95% CI: -0.315 to -0.019, P = 0.009). Use of RPM was also associated with lower rates of prolonged hospitalization, ICU admission, and mortality, though these trends did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions: In the midst of a global pandemic associated with inpatient bed, ventilator, and PPE shortages, the RPM program provided an effective strategy for outpatient clinical management and was associated with decreased rates of hospitalization, ICU admission, and mortality in cancer patients with COVID-19. This care model enabled simultaneous opportunity to mitigate the increased risks of exposure, transmission, and resource utilization associated with conventional care.","Pritchett, J.; Desai, A.; Borah, B.

Whilst many molecules act to control inappropriate activation, Properdin is the only known positive regulator of the human complement system. By stabilising the alternative pathway C3 convertase it promotes complement self-amplification and persistent activation boosting the magnitude of the serum complement response by all triggers. We have identified a novel family of alternative pathway complement inhibitors, hereafter termed CirpA. Functional and structural characterisation reveals that CirpA family directly bind to properdin, inhibiting its ability to promote complement activation, and leading to potent inhibition of the complement response in a species specific manner. For the first time this study provides a full functional and structural characterization of a properdin inhibitor, opening avenues for future therapeutic approaches.","Braunger, Katharina; Ahn, Jiyoon; Jore, Matthijs M.; Johnson, Steven; Tang, Terence; Pedersen, Dennis V.; Andersen, Gregers R.; Lea, Susan M.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.02.438250,217

A paper prominently circulated on social media concluded that countries requiring more infant vaccinations have higher infant mortality rates (IMR), which has serious public health implications. However, inappropriate data exclusion and other statistical flaws in that paper merit a closer examination of this correlation. We re-analyzed the original data used in Miller and Goldman's study to investigate the relationship between vaccine doses and IMR. We show that the sub-sample of 30 countries used in the original paper was not a random sample from the entire dataset, and the correlation coefficient of 0.49 reported in that study is virtually impossible without data manipulation. Next, we show IMR as a function of countries' actual vaccination rates, rather than vaccination schedule, and show a strong negative correlation between vaccination rates and IMR. Finally, we analyze United States IMR data as a function of Hepatitis B vaccination rate to show an example of increased vaccination rates corresponding with reduced infant death over time. From our analyses, it is clear that vaccination does not predict higher IMR as previously reported.","Nysetvold, E.; Mika, T.; Elison, W.; Garrett, D.; Hunt, J.; Tsuchiya, I.; Brugger, S.

Ninety children (median 3.5 years) were randomized and completed baseline and 6-month evaluations. Due to the COVID pandemic, only 68 completed 12-month assessments. The only adverse events (AEs) related to the cell products were 8 transient infusion reactions (3 CB, 5 hCT-MSC). An additional 95 non-severe AEs and 33 severe AEs were unrelated to the products. At 6 months, there was no statistical difference in change in GMFM-66 scores between Natural History (n=31) and either treatment group (CB n=31, hCTMSC n=28). At 12 months, after adjustment for baseline GMFCS level, GMFM-66 score, and etiology of CP, the mean GMFM-66 score of the hCT- MSC group (n=23) was 1.4 points higher than Natural History (n=25;95% CI: -1.1, 4.0;p=0.27) and the CB group (n=20) was 3.3 points higher than Natural History (95% CI: 0.59, 5.93;p=0.02). High dose allogeneic CB, but not hCT-MSC, infusion is associated with gross motor improvement in young children with CP, consistent with the dose effect in a prior study of autologous CB. A phase 3 randomized placebo-controlled study should be performed to confirm the CB observation.","Sun, J. M.; Case, L. E.; McLaughlin, C.; Skergan, N.; Jasien, J.

This paper looks at the effect that these activities had on emissions caused by ground transport among different countries. CO2 emission year-to-date dropped by 5.4% with respect to the 2019 statistics, which means that the scope of the decrease is much more abrupt than during past financial crises or World War II. The circumstance of emissions relates to lockdown measures in every nation. By the beginning of July 2020, the pandemic's impacts on worldwide emission reduced as lockdown limitations were loosened and some monetary exercises restarted, although the air pollution is still lower in contrast to 2019. The article traces back the reasons for the observed decline from the perspective of different countries and economy sectors. While there is no doubt that the major vector of changes was the COVID-19 pandemic, an increasingly important role of climate changes is also visible in the analysed data.","Sikorski, M.; Majewski, J.; Snarski, W.",7th International Conference on Renewable Energy Technologies,https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202124202003,217
178919,"Nurses’ intention to work during the COVID-19 outbreak in West Sumatra, Indonesia",2021,"The purpose of the academic paper is to study the new personnel management system within the conditions of external shocks (pandemic). The methodology is based on quantitative and qualitative methodology using in-depth interview methods with the HR Project Director for Cement JSC ""Podilsky Cement"" and Director on Projects in the sphere of Cement Personnel, CRH Ukraine, content analysis of the company's websites, statistical analysis of financial statements in order to determine the effectiveness of personnel management programs. The results prove that within the conditions of new social-economic reality through external shocks (pandemic) a new system of personnel management is formed, which through technology transforms the threats of management (hiring, employment) into opportunities for development and training, mentoring, internships by reducing staff turnover. Thus, the positive effect emerges of replacing the negative consequences of the virus spreading with the potential for human resources' development through effective virtual communication. External shocks cause a change in the social variables of the organization through the transformation of values, motivation, efficiency of employees. Within the pandemic conditions, the value of the collective atmosphere for employees increases, which will have a medium-term effect in the form of increased financial performance of organizations. The practical significance of the results lies in the possibility of using the results in human resource management, namely the integration of technology into personnel management in order to establish virtual communications.","Marchenko, O.

In this work, a novel approach to augmentation of small datasets is proposed based on an ensemble of neural network models of unsupervised generative self-learning. Applying generative learning with an ensemble of individual models allowed to identify stable clusters of data points in the latent representations of the observable data. Several techniques of augmentation based on identified latent cluster structure were applied to produce new data points and enhance the dataset. The proposed method can be used with small and extremely small datasets to identify characteristics patterns, augment data and in some cases, improve accuracy of classification in the scenarios with strong deficit of labels.","Dolgikh, S.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.21.21254796v1?rss=1,217

The COVID 19 pandemic created a new threat to this common 'slow to learn and adapt' model in healthcare. We describe how UPMC committed to a rapid learning health system (LHS) model to respond to the COVID 19 pandemic. Methods: An observational cohort study was conducted among 11,429 hospitalized patients from 22 hospitals (PA, NY) with a primary diagnosis of COVID 19 infection (March 19, 2020 to June 6, 2021). Sociodemographic and clinical data were captured from UPMC electronic medical record (EMR) systems. Patients were grouped into four time-defined patient 'waves' based on nadir of daily hospital admissions, with wave 3 (September 20, 2020 to March 10, 2021) split at its zenith due to high volume with steep acceleration and deceleration. Outcomes included changes in clinical practice (e.g., use of corticosteroids, antivirals, and other therapies) in relation to timing of internal system analyses, scientific publications, and regulatory approvals, along with 30-day rate of mortality over time. Results: Mean (SD) daily number of hospital admissions was 26 (28) with a maximum 7 day moving average of 107 patients. System wide implementation of the use of dexamethasone, remdesivir, and tocilizumab occurred within days of release of corresponding seminal publications and regulatory actions. After adjustment for differences in patient clinical profiles over time, each month of hospital admission was associated with an estimated 5% lower odds of 30 day mortality (adjusted OR = 0.95, 95% confidence interval: 0.92 to 0.97, p < .001). Conclusions: In our large LHS, near real-time changes in clinical management of COVID 19 patients happened promptly as scientific publications and regulatory approvals occurred throughout the pandemic. Alongside these changes, patients with COVID 19 experienced lower adjusted 30 day mortality following hospital admission over time.","McCreary, E. J.; Kip, K. E.; Bariola, J.

A remarkable consequence of topological wave functions is the emergence of edge modes, a phenomenon known as bulk-edge correspondence, that gives rise to quantized or chiral physical properties. While edge modes are widely presented as signatures of non-trivial topology, how bulk wave functions can manifest explicitly topological properties remains unresolved. Here, using high-resolution inelastic x-ray spectroscopy (IXS) combined with first principles calculations, we report experimental signatures of chiral wave functions in the bulk phonon spectrum of BaPtGe, which we show to host a previously undiscovered twofold degenerate quadruple Weyl node. The chirality of the degenerate phononic wave function yields a non-trivial phonon dynamical structure factor, S(Q,$\omega$), along high-symmetry directions, that is in excellent agreement with numerical and model calculations. Our results establish IXS as a powerful tool to uncover topological wave functions, providing a key missing ingredient in the study of topological quantum matter.","Li, Haoxiang; Zhang, Tiantian; Said, A.; Fu, Y.; Fabbris, G.; Mazzone, D.

182460,Online exercise rehabilitation to stable COPD patients during the second COVID wave: are physiotherapists able to help?,2020,"Background: Telemedicine was widely utilised to complement face-to-face (F2F) care in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, but the impact of this on patient care is poorly understood. Objectives: To investigate the impact of telemedicine during COVID-19 on outpatient rheumatology services. Methods: We retrospectively audited patient electronic medical records from rheumatology outpatient clinics in an urban tertiary rheumatology centre between April-May 2020 (telemedicine cohort) and April-May 2019 (comparator cohort). Differences in age, sex, primary diagnosis, medications, and proportion of new/review appointments were assessed using Mann-Whitney U and Chi-square tests. Univariate analysis was used to estimate associations between telemedicine usage and the ability to assign a diagnosis in patients without a prior rheumatological diagnosis, the frequency of changes to immunosuppression, subsequent F2F review, planned admissions or procedures, follow-up phone calls, and time to next appointment. Results: 3,040 outpatient appointments were audited: 1,443 from 2019 and 1,597 from 2020. There was no statistically significant difference in the age, sex, proportion of new/review appointments, or frequency of immunosuppression use between the cohorts. Inflammatory arthritis (IA) was a more common diagnosis in the 2020 cohort (35.1% vs 31%, p=0.024). 96.7% (n=1,444) of patients seen in the 2020 cohort were reviewed via telemedicine. In patients without an existing rheumatological diagnosis, the odds of making a diagnosis at the appointment were significantly lower in 2020 (28.6% vs 57.4%;OR 0.30 [95% CI 0.16-0.53];p<0.001). Clinicians were also less likely to change immunosuppressive therapy in 2020 (22.6% vs 27.4%;OR 0.78 [95% CI 0.65-0.92];p=0.004). This was mostly driven by less de-escalation in therapy (10% vs 12.6%;OR 0.75 [95% CI 0.59-0.95];p=0.019) as there was no statistically significant difference in the escalation or switching of immunosuppressive therapies. There was no significant difference in frequency of follow-up phone calls, however, patients seen in 2020 required earlier follow-up appointments (p<0.001). There was also no difference in unplanned rheumatological presentations but significantly fewer planned admissions and procedures in 2020 (1% vs 2.6%, p=0.002). Appointment non-attendance reduced in 2020 to 6.5% from 10.9% in 2019 (OR 0.57 [95% CI 0.44-0.74];p<0.001), however the odds of discharging a patient from care were significantly lower in 2020 (3.9% vs 6%;OR 0.64 [95% CI 0.46-0.89];p=0.008), although there was no significance when patients who failed to attend were excluded. Amongst patients seen via telemedicine in 2020, a subsequent F2F appointment was required in 9.4%. The predictors of needing a F2F review were being a new patient (OR 6.28 [95% CI 4.10-9.64];p<0.001), not having a prior rheumatological diagnosis (OR 18.43 [95% CI: 2.35-144.63];p=0.006), or having a diagnosis of IA (OR 2.85 [95% CI: 1.40-5.80];p=0.004) or connective tissue disease (OR 3.22 [95% CI: 1.11-9.32];p=0.031). Conclusion: Most patients in the 2020 cohort were seen via telemedicine. Telemedicine use during the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with reduced clinic non-attendance, but with diagnostic delay, reduced likelihood of changing existing immunosuppressive therapy, earlier requirement for review, and lower likelihood of discharge. While the effects of telemedicine cannot be differentiated from changes in practice related to other aspects of the pandemic, they suggest that telemedicine may have a negative impact on the timeliness of management of rheumatology patients.","Zhu, W.; De Silva, T.; Eades, L.; Morton, S.; Ayoub, S.; Morand, E.

Researchers are working around the clock to control this pandemic and consequent waves of viral reproduction, through repurposing existing drugs as well as designing new vaccines. Several countries have hastened vaccine design and clinical trials to quickly address this outbreak. Currently, more than 250 aspirants against SARS-CoV-2 are in progress, including mRNA-replicating or non-replicating viral vectored-, DNA-, autologous dendritic cell-based-, and inactivated virus-vaccines. Vaccines work by prompting effector mechanisms such as cells/molecules, which target quickly replicating pathogens and neutralize their toxic constituents. Vaccine-stimulated immune effectors include adjuvant, affinity, avidity, affinity maturation, antibodies, antigen-presenting cells, B lymphocytes, carrier protein, CD4+ T-helper cells. In this review, we describe updated information on the various vaccines available over the last two decades, along with recent progress in the ongoing battle developing 63 diverse vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.

Although telocytes can be found in many different tissues in luding the heart1, lung2 and intestine3, their tissue-specific roles are poorly understood. Here we identify a cell signalling role for telocytes in the periodontium whereby telocytes regulate macrophage activity. Methods We performed scRNA-seq and lineage tracing to identify TCs in mouse periodontium in homeostasis and periodontitis and carried out HGF signalling inhibition experiments using Tivantinib. Results We demonstrated that TCs are quiescent in homeostasis, however, they proliferate and serve as a major source of HGF in periodontitis. Macrophages receive telocyte-derived HGF signals and shift from an M1 to a M1/M2 hybrid state. Conclusions Our results reveal the source of HGF signals in periodontal tissue and provide new insights into the function of TCs in regulating macrophage behaviour in periodontitis through HGF/c-Met cell signalling, that may provide a novel approach in periodontitis treatment. Graphic abstract A population of telocytes (TC) have been identified in the periodontium. They are quiescent in homeostasis, however, in periodontitis, they are activated and send HGF signals to LPS activated iNOS+ (M1) macrophages. Macrophages receive the HGF signals via c-Met, which results in the expression of M2 marker Arg1, representing in an increase of M1/M2 hybrid macrophages. The expression of Arg1 can be inhibited by a HGF/c-Met selective inhibitor Tivantinib.","Zhao, Jing; Sharpe, Paul T.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.03.446871,217

Previous studies have shown that the TGEV external protein M plays a major role in IFN-alpha induction by a non-infectious virus, whereas protein S is not involved. The present study extended these results by showing that monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed at the external viral protein sM could not block IFN-alpha induction, which argues against a direct role for this protein. In the same type of blocking experiment, MAbs to the TGEV receptor aminopeptidase N did not inhibit IFN-alpha induction, which strongly indicates that viral replication or entry through the receptor is not needed for TGEV induction of IFN-alpha in leukocytes. In an attempt to isolate functional envelope proteins, TGEV virions were detergent-solubilized and reconstituted in virosomes. Although BIAcore antigenic analysis revealed that the three external viral proteins were present on the virosomes, these proteins were unable to induce IFN-alpha in porcine leukocytes, and seemed to compete with the native virus for IFN-alpha induction. These data indicated that IFN-alpha inducing interactions between TGEV external proteins and leukocytes required a complex native envelope protein structure which has been lost in the virosomes.","Riffault, S; Grosclaude, J; Vayssier, M; Laude, H; Charley, B",Veterinary research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9172843/,217

Rapid and reliable diagnosis of human coronavirus infections therefore becomes indispensable in a routine clinical setting. In this study, we present a very sensitive and specific TaqMan-based, real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) for the rapid detection and quantitation of human coronaviruses (HCoVs) OC43 and 229E. Absolute viral load measurement in clinical samples was achieved through the construction of in-house HCoV OC43 and 229E cRNA standards for the generation of a standard curve. The HCoV OC43 assay allows quantitation over a range from 20 to 2 x 10(8) RNA copies per reaction mixture (5 microl RNA extract). When this is extrapolated to clinical samples, this corresponds to a detection range of 10(3) to 10(10) viral genome equivalents per ml. By using the HCoV 229E qRT-PCR assay, viral RNA copies ranging from 200 to 2 x 10(9) per reaction mixture can be detected, which corresponds to 10(4) to 10(11) viral genome equivalents per ml sample. A total of 100 respiratory samples screened for the presence of HCoVs OC43 and 229E by using conventional RT-PCR were assessed in parallel by the qRT-PCR assays. By use of the real-time qRT-PCR techniques, the detection rate of HCoVs OC43 and 229E increased from 2.0% to 3.1% and from 0.3% to 2.5%, respectively. The real-time qRT-PCR assays described here allow the rapid, specific, and sensitive laboratory detection and quantitation of human coronaviruses OC43 and 229E.","Vijgen, Leen; Keyaerts, Els; Moës, Elien; Maes, Piet; Duson, Griet; Van Ranst, Marc",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16272469/,217

Currently the technique can be customized in consideration of the different tumor angioarchitecture, thanks to embolic materials with different vascular penetration: solid particles of polyvinyl-alcohol (PVA), histoacryl glue, and liquid polymer (Onyx(®)). Two cases of swelling dissection with volume progression over time came to our observation. Both patients (45 and 70-year-old women) were studied with neck ultrasound imaging and computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance (MR). In both cases the radiological investigations confirmed the clinical suspicion of carotid paraganglioma. Both patients were sent for angiography control and preoperative devascularization of the lesion. The treatment was performed under general anesthesia using, depending on the type of tumor vasculature, in case 1 solid particles of PVA and histoacryl glue, and in case 2 Onyx(®) (Covidien, Irvine). The patients successfully underwent excision of the lesion via cervicotomy within a week from the embolization procedure, without any complications. The histological findings confirmed the diagnosis of chemodectoma, and macrophage infiltrates were seen in the regions previously embolized. At one-year follow-up, there was no evidence of recurrent disease. The preoperative embolization of vascular lesions of the neck represents a safe technique that yields the best results when customized over the type of vascularization of the lesion, enabling the use of the most appropriate materials, depending on the case to be treated.","Faragò, Giuseppe; Castellani, Carlotta; Ponzi, Silvano; Jankovic, Claudio; Saginario, Vittorio; Berardi, Carlo; Pollo, Bianca; Ciceri, Elisa F",The neuroradiology journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24355187/,217

The introduction of a specific prion-binding ligand gel in combination with SD treatment, time-reduced from 4 to 1-1.5 h, still ensures efficient virus kill, reduces abnormal prion protein by >5 log steps, and preserves levels of plasmin inhibitor at close to the reference range. Infections with known non-enveloped viruses such as HAV or parvovirus B19 are prevented by ensuring low virus loads in the starting plasma units, dilution through pooling of single plasma units, and neutralization of immune antibodies already present in the initial plasma pools. The major advantages of SD plasma over fresh frozen plasma and the other pathogen-inactivated plasmas are its extreme safety with respect to transfusion-related acute lung injury and the significantly lower likelihood of provoking allergic reactions. Both advantages are best interpreted as results of the dilution effect of pooling. No fewer than 18 clinical studies covering all indications for plasma, and extensive clinical experience have shown that reduced levels of coagulation factors and inhibitors as a result of SD treatment do not impair significantly the clinical efficacy or tolerance of plasma. Properly standardized clotting factor and inhibitor potencies and low batch-to-batch variations when compared with single-donor plasma units makes SD plasma more suitable for standardized treatment.","Hellstern, Peter; Solheim, Bjarte G",Transfusion medicine and hemotherapy : offizielles Organ der Deutschen Gesellschaft fur Transfusionsmedizin und Immunhamatologie,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21779207/,217

APN was demonstrated by the same techniques to be present on villous enterocytes from both newborn and weaned piglets, as well as on ST cells. It was concluded that the 200 kDa protein may be a second receptor for TGEV, contributing to the high susceptibility of newborn piglets to the virus.","Weingartl, H M; Derbyshire, J B",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8830502/,217

199674,[Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the management of heart failure outpatient clinics. Lessons during the lockdown restrictions],2020,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW This review covers the epidemiological research from developing countries to identify the scope of research in the various aspects of epidemiology and the strengths of research. The period covered is June 2004 to June 2005. The literature survey used searches of Medline, key psychiatric journals and personal correspondence with leading psychiatric researchers from developing countries. RECENT FINDINGS There is a new interest in epidemiological studies in developing countries. These studies have been driven by three factors, namely international collaboration; specific situations like disasters, terrorism and severe acute respiratory syndrome; and international attention to specific topics like maternal depression. There is limited long-term research on specific conditions. There are a number of leads suggesting local social-cultural factors contribute to the distribution of psychiatric problems. Child psychiatry continues to be low in priority. There is also lack of research in areas such as personality disorders and organic psychiatric disorders. SUMMARY It is possible to carry out high quality epidemiological research in developing countries. Such research has provided new insights into the distribution, causation, course and outcome of mental disorders. There is need for greater attention to the development of epidemiological assessment tools to suit local conditions. Specific centers/institutions developing long-term research interests on specific subjects would be valuable for future efforts. There is also need to widen the conditions to be studied.","Murthy, R Srinivasa; Lakshminarayana, Rashmi",Current opinion in psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16639120/,217
200102,Apples to Oranges: Ethical Considerations in COVID-19 Surgical Recovery,2020,"OBJECTIVE To further validate an antibody-capture ELISA for measuring bovine coronavirus (BCV) exposure (antibody seroresponse) in cattle and to explain the apparent loss of sensitivity of a BCV antigen-capture ELISA when testing feces from adult versus neonatal cattle. ANIMALS 98 adult cows from herds with and without winter dysentery; 10 gnotobiotic or colostrum-deprived calves. PROCEDURES Results of an antibody-capture ELISA for BCV and a plaque reduction virus neutralization assay performed on paired serum samples from 24 cattle were compared with each other and with results of immunoelectron microscopy (IEM) of feces for BCV. For samples from 98 cattle, results of antibody-capture ELISA were compared with results of IEM. Calves were inoculated with feces ELISA-positive or IEM-positive for BCV and monitored for BCV infection. An ELISA was developed to detect BCV antigen-antibody complexes in feces and results were compared with results of an antigen-capture ELISA and IEM. RESULTS Antibody-capture ELISA results correlated with neutralization assay results, but agreed more closely with results of IEM. Calves became infected with BCV following inoculation with either ELISA-positive or ELISA-negative but IEM-positive feces. Results of the antigen-antibody ELISA correlated with results of IEM and the antigen-capture ELISA. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS In adult cattle, testing of paired serum samples by use of an antibody-capture ELISA may be a better indicator of recent BCV exposure than results of virus neutralization tests. Antigen-antibody binding in feces may interfere with results of antigen-capture ELISA for BCV.","Smith, D R; Nielsen, P R; Gadfield, K L; Saif, L J",American journal of veterinary research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9706198/,217

METHODS Follow-up lung function tests and chest high-resolution computerized tomography (HRCT) were performed in medical staff with SARS from Dec. 2003 to Feb. 2004. RESULTS Thirty-one (7.64%) of 406 patients showed abnormal ventilatory function, while 165 of 404 patients showed diffusing abnormality. Of the 434 patients who had received HRCT scans, 151 (34.79%) showed abnormalities including subpleural and basal ground-glass and reticular attenuation, nodular septal thickening and bronchiectasis. Of the 395 patients who had received both lung function test and HRCT scanning, 55 (13.92%) had abnormalities both in the lung function and HRCT. The decrease in diffusing capacity in patients with HRCT changes was more significant than those without HRCT changes. CONCLUSIONS Lung function and lung imaging were abnormal in some patients with SARS after recovery.

201460,Evaluation of Chilblains as a Manifestation of the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Although viral infections are often invoked as environmental factors in the aetiology and pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS) it is only recently that a specific, indirect, cytokine-mediated mechanism for triggering of relapses during viral infections has been demonstrated. It is not yet clear however whether this indirect mechanism can account for all reported viral associations with the aetiopathogenesis of MS. A direct causal role of central nervous system (CNS) viral infection in MS has largely been discounted following repeated failures to demonstrate virus within the oligodendrocyte-myelin unit. In the light of increasing evidence of blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction in MS and to further explore the issue of possible viral involvement in MS, an ultrastructural search for viruses was undertaken in the CNS microvasculature, in autopsy and biopsy tissue from human CNS primary demyelinating diseases, including MS (20 cases), idiopathic monophasic CNS demyelinating disease (Mdemy, four cases) and metabolic or immunopathological demyelinating disease (two cases). For comparison, tissues from CNS viral disease in which demyelination is a major feature (nine cases) were examined in the same way. Control CNS tissues (nine cases) from a range of other neurological and non-neurological diseases were also examined. Outside the MS and Mdemy groups, morphological evidence of virus associations with the BBB were found only in the acute and subacute viral encephalitides (three cases subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, one case of Herpes encephalitis) and in one case of disseminated Cytomegalovirus infection. In a small proportion of MS and Mdemy cases, particles resembling either adenovirus (one case of MS) or paramyxovirus (one case of MS, one case of Mdemy) were found in the vicinity of microvessels. In each case a different cell type or extracellular compartment was involved and an exact correlation between the virus particles and the demyelinating lesions could not be demonstrated. Furthermore, corroborative clinical or laboratory evidence of current CNS infection in these primary demyelinating disease cases was available only from the single positive Mdemy case and not from the two cases of MS. This and other previously published evidence from MS (which implicated a Coronavirus) and other diseases highlights the potential vulnerability to viral infection of cells associated with the BBB. Furthermore it is concluded that the detection rate of such infections in pathological tissue could underestimate their true frequency. A possible role of transient virus-BBB interactions in triggering focal inflammation, BBB breakdown and demyelination in some cases of MS and parainfectious demyelinating disease cannot be discounted.","Kirk, J; Zhou, A L",Multiple sclerosis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9345442/,217
201487,Life and Death in the Age of COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND In obese patients, the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) following sleeve gastrectomy under titration of total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) and the relevance of risk factors to indicate prophylaxis is unknown. OBJECTIVES The hypothesis was that after automated TIVA, prophylaxis reduces PONV following laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. Our objective was to determine the incidence of PONV and evaluate the efficacy of dexamethasone and ondansetron as prophylaxis when automated intravenous anaesthesia is employed. DESIGN A randomised, placebo-controlled, single-centre, double-blinded study. SETTING Secondary care centre in New Caledonia from June 2013 to January 2014. PATIENTS A total of 122 patients were randomised and 117 (92 women) were included in the analysis (58 in the prophylaxis group and 59 in the placebo group). Eligibility criteria included at least two of the known risk factors for PONV: female sex, nonsmoking status, prior history of PONV or motion sickness and expected postoperative opioid analgesia. Exclusion criteria included disorders limiting the use of the bispectral index. INTERVENTIONS All patients received propofol and remifentanil controlled by the same automated system during induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia. The controller modifies the calculated effect-site concentrations according to bispectral index values. Patients received either intravenous dexamethasone 4 mg after tracheal intubation and ondansetron 4 mg during skin closure, or placebo. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary endpoint was the cumulative incidences of 24-h PONV and severe PONV (vomiting or nausea with a score of ≥4 on an 11-point verbal rating scale). Data are presented as percentage (95% confidence interval). RESULTS PONV in the first 24 h occurred in 45 (34 to 60)% of patients who received prophylaxis and 54 (41 to 67)% in the placebo group (P = 0.35). The numbers of patients who suffered severe PONV [19 (10 to 32)% in the prophylaxis group vs. 20 (11 to 33)%, P = 1, in the placebo group] and who required rescue antiemetic drugs [55 (41 to 68) vs. 63 (49 to 75)%, P = 0.46] were similar between the groups. CONCLUSION The combination of dexamethasone and ondansetron was not effective in preventing PONV or severe PONV in obese patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy after TIVA.

The framings of techno-scientific solutions for COVID-19 are similar to those that are presented to address many societal problems. The messy scientific and regulatory underpinnings of this desired silver bullet rarely make it fully into view. Technoscientific-related hope and its associated affects can operate as a kind of ""cruel optimism"" (Berlant 2010, 2011). It can be an affective response to return to life as ""normal"" that is psychologically soothing, even as its enactment may replicate destructive social, political, and economic structures. Hope and technoscience thread throughout the interactions between journalists and health officials in the health press briefings in the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Technoscientific complexity that challenges the desire to return to normal is rarely brought up in Ontario and Nova Scotia public health briefings. But when it is, health officials in this zone of interaction balance explanations of scientific reality and caution, while attempting to not crush hope for a techno-scientifically mediated return to normal. As such, public health discourse obscures or tempers cruel optimism rather than directly confronting it. © 2021 University of Toronto.

203924,Persistent post-covid symptoms in healthcare workers,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic and phased nationwide lockdown have impacted negatively on individuals with tuberculosis (TB) and routine TB services. Through a literature review and the perspective of members of a national TB Think Tank task team, we describe the impact of the pandemic and lockdown on TB patients and services as well as the potential long-term setback to TB control in South Africa (SA). Strategies to mitigate risk and impact are explored, together with opportunities to leverage synergies from both diseases to the benefit of the National TB Programme (NTP). With the emergence of COVID-19, activities to address this new pandemic have been prioritised across all sectors. Within the health system, the health workforce and resources have been redirected away from routine services towards the new disease priority. The social determinants of health have deteriorated during the lockdown, potentially increasing progression to TB disease and impacting negatively on people with TB and their households, resulting in additional barriers to accessing TB care, with early reports of a decline in TB testing rates. Fewer TB diagnoses, less attention to adherence and support during TB treatment, poorer treatment outcomes and consequent increased transmission will increase the TB burden and TB-related mortality. People with TB or a history of TB are likely to be vulnerable to COVID-19. Modifications to current treatment practices are suggested to reduce visits to health facilities and minimise the risks of COVID-19 exposure. The COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to negatively impact on TB control in TB-endemic settings such as SA. However, there are COVID-19-related health systems-strengthening developments that may help the NTP mitigate the impact of the pandemic on TB control. By integrating TB case finding into the advanced screening, testing, tracing and monitoring systems established for COVID-19, TB case finding and linkage to care could increase, with many more TB patients starting treatment. Similarly, integrating knowledge and awareness of TB into the increased healthcare worker and community education on infectious respiratory diseases, behavioural practices around infection prevention and control, and cough etiquette, including destigmatisation of mask use, may contribute to reducing TB transmission. However, these potential gains could be overwhelmed by the impact of increasing poverty and other social determinants of health on the burden of TB.","Loveday, M; Cox, H; Evans, D; Furin, J; Ndjeka, N; Osman, M; 039, Naidoo For The National Tb Think Tank; Outcomes039, Optimising Tb Treatment; Task Team, K",S Afr Med J,,217
203991,Assessing the regional impact of Japan's COVID-19 state of emergency declaration: a population-level observational study using social networking services,2021,"BACKGROUND: Several countries have released digital proximity tracing (DPT) apps to complement manual contact tracing for combatting the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. DPT aims to notify app users about proximity exposures to persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 so that they can self-quarantine. The success of DPT apps depends on user acceptance and the embedding of DPT into the pandemic mitigation strategy. OBJECTIVE: By searching for media articles published during the first 3 months after DPT launch, the implementation of DPT in Switzerland was evaluated to inform similar undertakings in other countries. The second aim of the study was to create a link between reported DPT implementation challenges and normalization process theory for planning and optimizing complex digital health interventions, which can provide useful guidance for decision-making in DPT design and implementation. METHODS: A Swiss media database was searched for articles on the Swiss DPT app (SwissCovid) published in German or French between July 4 and October 3, 2020. In a structured process, topics were extracted and clustered manually from articles that were deemed pertinent. Extracted topics were mapped to four NPT constructs, which reflected the flow of intervention development from planning, stakeholder onboarding, and execution to critical appraisal. Coherence constructs describe sense-making by stakeholders, cognitive participation constructs reflect participants' efforts to create engagement with the intervention, collective actions refer to intervention execution and joint stakeholder efforts to make the intervention work, and reflexive monitoring refers to collective risk-benefit appraisals to create improvements. RESULTS: Out of 94 articles deemed pertinent and selected for closer inspection, 38 provided unique information on implementation challenges. Five challenge areas were identified: communication challenges, challenges for DPT to interface with other processes, fear of resource competition with established pandemic mitigation measures, unclear DPT effectiveness, and obstacles to greater user coverage and compliance. Specifically, several articles mentioned unclear DPT benefits to affect commitment and to raise fears among different health system actors regarding resource competition. Moreover, media reports indicated process interface challenges such as delays or unclear responsibilities in the notification cascade, as well as misunderstandings and unmet communication needs from health system actors. Finally, reports suggested misaligned incentives, not only for app usage by the public but also for process engagement by other actors in the app notification cascade. NPT provided a well-fitting framework to contextualize the different DPT implementation challenges and to highlight improvement strategies, namely a better alignment of stakeholder incentives, or stakeholder-specific communication to address their concerns about DPT. CONCLUSIONS: Early experiences from one of the first adopters of DPT indicate that nontechnical implementation challenges may affect the effectiveness of DPT. The NPT analysis provides a novel perspective on DPT implementation and stresses the need for stakeholder inclusion in development and operationalization.","von Wyl, Viktor",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,,217

204548,Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation: Possible method for respirator disinfection to facilitate reuse during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Besides the pandemic caused by the coronavirus outbreak, many other pathogenic microbes also pose a devastating threat to human health, for instance, pathogenic bacteria. Due to the lack of broad-spectrum antibiotics, it is urgent to develop nonantibiotic strategies to fight bacteria. Herein, inspired by the localized ""capture and killing"" action of bacteriophages, a virus-like peroxidase-mimic (V-POD-M) is synthesized for efficient bacterial capture (mesoporous spiky structures) and synergistic catalytic sterilization (metal-organic-framework-derived catalytic core). Experimental and theoretical calculations show that the active compound, MoO3 , can serve as a peroxo-complex-intermediate to reduce the free energy for catalyzing H2 O2 , which mainly benefits the generation of â¢OH radicals. The unique virus-like spikes endow the V-POD-M with fast bacterial capture and killing abilities (nearly 100% at 16 µg mL-1 ). Furthermore, the in vivo experiments show that V-POD-M possesses similar disinfection treatment and wound skin recovery efficiencies to vancomycin. It is suggested that this inexpensive, durable, and highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) catalytic active V-POD-M provides a promising broad-spectrum therapy for nonantibiotic disinfection.","Yang, Ye; Wu, Xizheng; Ma, Lang; He, Chao; Cao, Sujiao; Long, Yanping; Huang, Jianbo; Rodriguez, Raul D; Cheng, Chong; Zhao, Changsheng; Qiu, Li",Adv Mater,,217
204674,Managing chronic pain patients at the time of COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: The Bronx has the highest prevalence of asthma in the United States (US), and was also an early COVID-19 epicenter, making it a unique study location. Worldwide reports describe significant declines in pediatric emergency department (PED) visits during COVID-19. The ongoing impact of COVID-19 on all PED presentations, including asthma, at an early epicenter has not been studied beyond the pandemic peak and into the early phases of state re-opening. OBJECTIVES: To compare PED health-seeking behaviors and clinical characteristics during the 2020 pandemic and subsequent initial New York State (NYS) phased re-opening to the same period in 2019. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of children <21 years utilizing the PED at a high-volume quaternary children's hospital in The Bronx, NY from March 15th 2020 - July 6th 2020 (pandemic cohort) and the same interval in 2019 (comparison cohort). Visits were assigned to pre-determined diagnostic categories. Demographic and clinical data were compared. RESULTS: 19,981 visits were included. Visits declined by 66% during 2020. Proportions of asthma visits (2% vs. 7%, p < 0.0001) and minor medical problems (61% vs. 67%, p < 0.0001) had significant declines in the pandemic cohort, while major medical problems (13% vs. 8%, p < 0.0001), appendicitis (1% vs. 0.4%, p < 0.0001) and other surgical complaints (1% vs. 0.5%, p < 0.0001) had proportional increases in the pandemic cohort. No significant proportional changes were noted among psychosocial and trauma groups between the two cohorts. CONCLUSION: The pandemic cohort experienced a substantial decrease in PED volume, but an increase in acuity and admission rates, which was sustained through the NYS phase-II re-opening. Despite being located in an asthma hub, the incidence of asthma-related PED visits declined appreciably in the pandemic cohort. Future studies examining the effects of indoor allergens in isolation on pediatric asthma are warranted.","Levene, Rachel; Fein, Daniel M; Silver, Ellen J; Joels, Joanna R; Khine, Hnin",Am J Emerg Med,,217

The control group received routine treatment + IFN analog (two injections, bid). Overall response rate (ORR) of five kinds clinical symptoms. Further outcomes were daily average score and the response rate of each of the symptoms above. Results: A total of 163 patients were included in the full analysis set (FAS) and 151 patients were included in the per-protocol set (PPS). After 7 days of treatment, ORR of clinical symptoms was higher in IFNα1b group than that in control group for both the FAS and PPS. Moreover, after 7 days of treatment, the daily score of three efficacy indexes including expectoration, respiratory rate, and pulmonary rales were improved. The ORRs for expectoration and pulmonary rales were higher in the IFNα1b group than in the control group (P &lt; 0.05). There were no significant differences of the ORRs for coughing, chest pain and respiratory rate between the two groups (P &gt; 0.05).

205018,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Easter,2021,"Cell senescence is a process that causes growth arrest and the release of a senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP), characterized by secretion of chemokines, cytokines, cell growth factors and metalloproteases, leading to a tissue condition that may precipitate cancers and neurodegenerative processes. With the recent pandemic of coronavirus, senolytic drugs are being considered as possible therapeutic tools to reduce the virulence of SARS-CoV-2. In the last few years, our research group showed that lithium carbonate at microdose levels was able to stabilize memory and change neuropathological characteristics of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present work, we present evidence that low-dose lithium can reduce the SASP of human iPSCs-derived astrocytes following acute treatment, suggesting that microdose lithium could protect cells from senescence and development of aging-related conditions. With the present findings, a perspective of the potential use of low-dose lithium in old patients from the ""high risk group"" for COVID-19 (with hypertension, diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) is presented.","Viel, Tania; Chinta, Shankar; Rane, Anand; Chamoli, Manish; Buck, Hudson; Andersen, Julie",Aging (Albany NY),,217

205791,Disruptive Modifications to Cardiac Critical Care Delivery During the Covid-19 Pandemic: An International Perspective,2020,"In seeking to limit the number of new infections of COVID-19, governments around the world have implemented national lockdowns and guidelines about safe behaviours. Lockdown requires people to stay home and only leave when essential such as to purchase groceries and medication. In low- and middle-income countries, many of which have large proportions of the population living in precarity, lockdown forces millions of people to spend prolonged periods of time together in close proximity to one another and with limited resources. In many ways, efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 in densely populated communities with limited access to food, water and sanitation may seem counter-intuitive and even impossible under conditions of precarity. In this paper, we explore the barriers to implementation of lockdown rules in conditions of precarity. We conceptualise the structural barriers by drawing on the Theoretical Domains Framework to explain how these barriers influence adherence to lockdown rules. We argue that without sufficient support or intervention to help poor communities mitigate these structural barriers, adhering to lockdown rules is difficult, resulting in continued COVID-19 infections.","Coetzee, Bronwyné Jo039; sean,; Kagee, Ashraf",Glob Public Health,,217

Three days before the start of the block week of the ""Teamwork"" module, the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) announced the ban on live interaction, which made it impossible to conduct five days of practice in the simulation centre of the University Hospital of Zurich. But how can the teaching of all the learning objectives necessary for medical training be guaranteed during an exceptional situation with constantly changing conditions? In the case of the BSc Human Medicine at ETH Zurich (ETHZ), the answer is: Hybrid teaching. The field report ""COVID-19 as a chance for hybrid teaching concepts"" outlines how ETHZ switched to hybrid teaching within a very short time and how hospital placements were combined with video conferences. The qualitative surveys conducted at the end of the semester and the weekly quantitative surveys of students from March to June indicate the importance of personal exchange despite the ban on contact and that interactivity is possible even without physical proximity. An example from the autumn semester will also be used to show which aspects have proved to be successful and can therefore be retained.","Weissmann, Yaël; Useini, Mirdita; Goldhahn, Jörg",GMS J Med Educ,,217
209013,Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Patients with Immune Thrombocytopaenia,2021,"N-linked glycosylation is one of the most abundant posttranslational modifications of membrane-bound proteins in eukaryotes and affects a number of biological activities, including protein biosynthesis, protein stability, intracellular trafficking, subcellular localization, and ligand-receptor interaction. Accumulating evidence indicates that cell membrane immune checkpoint proteins, such as programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), are glycosylated with heavy N-linked glycan moieties in human cancers. N-linked glycosylation of PD-L1 maintains its protein stability and interaction with its cognate receptor, programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), and this in turn promotes evasion of T-cell immunity. Studies have suggested targeting PD-L1 glycosylation as a therapeutic option by rational combination of cancer immunotherapies. Interestingly, structural hindrance by N-glycan on PD-L1 in fixed samples impedes its recognition by PD-L1 diagnostic antibodies. Notably, the removal of N-linked glycosylation enhances PD-L1 detection in a variety of bioassays and more accurately predicts the therapeutic efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, suggesting an important clinical implication of PD-L1 N-linked glycosylation. A detailed understanding of the regulatory mechanisms, cellular functions, and diagnostic limits underlying PD-L1 N-linked glycosylation could shed new light on the clinical development of immune checkpoint inhibitors for cancer treatment and deepen our knowledge of biomarkers to identify patients who would benefit the most from immunotherapy. In this review, we highlight the effects of protein glycosylation on cancer immunotherapy using N-linked glycosylation of PD-L1 as an example. In addition, we consider the potential impacts of PD-L1 N-linked glycosylation on clinical diagnosis. The notion of utilizing the deglycosylated form of PD-L1 as a predictive biomarker to guide anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy is also discussed.","Wang, Ying-Nai; Lee, Heng-Huan; Hsu, Jennifer L; Yu, Dihua; Hung, Mien-Chie",J Biomed Sci,,217

Using cross-sectional data from the DocStyles survey administered September-October 2020 (68% response rate), we compared changes in family planning-related clinical services and healthcare delivery strategies before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and assessed service provision issues among 1063 U.S. physicians whose practice provided family planning services just before the pandemic. About one-fifth of those whose practices provided the following services or strategies just before the pandemic discontinued these services during the pandemic: long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) placement (16%); LARC removal (17%); providing or prescribing emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs) in advance (18%); and reminding patients about contraception injections or LARC removal or replacement (20%). Many practices not providing the following services or strategies just before the pandemic initiated these services during the pandemic: telehealth for contraception initiation (43%); telehealth for contraception continuation (48%); and renewing contraception prescriptions without requiring an office visit (36%). While a smaller proportion of physicians reported service provision issues in the month before survey completion than at any point during the pandemic, about one-third still reported fewer adult females seeking care (37%) and technical challenges with telehealth (32%). Discontinuation of key family planning services during the COVID-19 pandemic may limit contraception access and impede reproductive autonomy. Implementing healthcare service delivery strategies that reduce the need for in-person visits (e.g., telehealth for contraception, providing or prescribing ECPs in advance) may decrease disruptions in care. Resources exist for public health and clinical efforts to ensure contraception access during the pandemic.","Zapata, Lauren B; Curtis, Kathryn M; Steiner, Riley J; Reeves, Jennifer A; Nguyen, Antoinette T; Miele, Kathryn; Whiteman, Maura K",Prev Med,,217

METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted at the prenatal care clinic of St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College (SPHMMC), Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, among pregnant women from 31 August to 2 November 2020. Participants were interviewed using Open Data Kit. Logistic regression was used to assess predictors. RESULTS: Among the 464 pregnant women, 33 (7.1%) reported IPV during pregnancy, and among these 24 (72.7%) reported emotional violence, 16 (48.5%) reported sexual violence, and 10 (30.3%) reported physical violence. Among the study participants, only 8 (1.7%) were screened for IPV. IPV was reported 3.27 times more often by women who reported that their partner chewed Khat compared with those women whose partner did not (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.27; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.45-7.38), and 1.52 times more often women who reported that their partner drank alcohol compared with those women whose partner did not (aOR 1.52; 95% CI 1.01-2.28). CONCLUSION: Very few women were screened for IPV. Partners drinking alcohol and chewing Khat are significantly positively associated with IPV during pregnancy. IPV screening should be included in the national management protocol of obstetric cases of Ethiopia.","Teshome, Abel; Gudu, Wondimu; Bekele, Delayehu; Asfaw, Mariamawit; Enyew, Ruhama; Compton, Sarah D",Int. j. gynaecol. obstet,,217

METHODS: A dynamic transmission model that extended the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered framework by incorporating asymptomatic, presymptomatic and waiting-to-be-diagnosed patients was constructed to conduct the cost-effectiveness analysis from the healthcare system perspective. To estimate epidemic parameters, the model was first calibrated to the observed epidemic curve in Wuhan from 23 January to 19 March 2020. Following the calibration, the infected compartment was replaced by 3 severity-defined health states to reflect differential costs and quality of life associated with disease gravity. Costs and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) outcomes of 9 million simulated people were accrued across time to evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of remdesivir. As robustness checks, an alternative modelling technique using decision tree, additional epidemic scenarios representing different epidemic intensities, and 1-way parameter variations were also analysed. RESULTS: Remdesivir treatment cost CN¥97.93 million more than standard of care. Also, the net QALY gain from 5-day remdesivir treatment was 6947 QALYs. As such, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was CN¥14 098/QALY, substantially lower than the gross domestic product per capita threshold. The peak daily number of severe cases was 19% lower in the remdesivir treatment strategy. Overall, results were robust in alternative scenarios and sensitivity analyses.

On the 30th of April, 64 days after this first diagnosis, the number of patients had increased exponentially, reaching 19 224 confirmed cases and 1859 (9.67%) deaths. In response to this global outbreak, we summarize the current state of our understanding regarding COVID-19 in Mexico. METHODS: We obtained the data from the official website of the Ministry of Health in Mexico. The study period was between the 27th of February and the 30th of April 2020. The cases were confirmed using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and we analysed epidemiological, demographic and clinical data. RESULTS: In Mexico, most cases of COVID-19 were located in Mexico City. The mean age of the patients was 46 years. Of the 12 656 confirmed cases, most infected individuals were between the ages of 30 and 59 years (65.85%), and there was a higher incidence rate in men (58.18%) than in women (41.82%). The patients who died had one or more comorbidities, mainly hypertension (45.53%), diabetes (39.39%) and obesity (30.4%). In the first 64 days of the epidemic, China had reported 80 304 cases with a mortality rate of 3.66%. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate an early transmission of COVID-19 in Mexico.

There has been limited systematic analysis of PET findings after COVID-19 vaccination. Objective: To evaluate the frequency and characteristics of abnormal FDG and 11C-choline uptake on PET imaging performed after COVID-19 vaccination. Methods: This retrospective study included 67 patients (mean age 75.6±9.2 years; 43 men, 24 women) who underwent PET examination (PET/CT in 66, PET/MRI in 1; FDG in 54, 11C-choline in 13) between December 14th 2020 and March 10th 2021 following COVID-19 vaccination (Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in 52, Moderna vaccine in 15) and who had undergone pre-vaccination PET without visible axillary node uptake. PET was performed a median of 13 and 10 days after vaccination in patients who had received one (n = 44) and two (n = 23) doses, respectively. Two nuclear medicine physicians independently reviewed images, blinded to injection laterality and days since vaccination. Lymph node or deltoid SUVmax greater than blood pool SUVmax was considered positive. Interreader agreement was assessed, and the more experienced physician's measurements were used for subsequent analysis. Results: Positive axillary lymph node uptake was observed in 10.4% (7/67) of patients [7.4% (4/54) of FDG examinations, 23.1% (3/13) of 11C-choline examinations]; four and three patients with positive axillary lymph nodes had received Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, respectively. Injection laterality was documented in five of seven patients with positive axillary lymph nodes and was ipsilateral to the positive node in all five patients. PET was performed within 24 days of vaccination in all patients with a positive node. One patient exhibited extra-axillary lymph node uptake (ipsilateral supraclavicular uptake on FDG PET). Ipsilateral deltoid uptake was present in 14.5% (8/55) of patients with documented injection laterality, including in 42.9% (3/7) of patients with positive axillary lymph nodes. Interreader agreement for SUV measurements ranged from intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.600 to 0.988. Conclusion: Increased axillary lymph node or ipsilateral deltoid uptake is occasionally observed on FDG or 11C-choline PET performed after Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccination. Clinical impact: Interpreting physicians should recognize characteristics of abnormal uptake on PET after COVID-19 vaccination to guide optimal follow-up management and reduce unnecessary biopsies.","Schroeder, Dane G; Jang, Samuel; Johnson, Derek R; Takahashi, Hiroaki; Navin, Patrick J; Broski, Stephen M; Thorpe, Matthew P; Johnson, Geoffrey B; Young, Jason R",,,217

METHODS: We distributed an electronic questionnaire using the popular social application WeChat to adults from any province of China except Hubei Province, the epicenter of the outbreak. The questionnaire asked for demographic information, body weight, physical activity, and lifestyle factors before and during the quarantine. RESULTS: Of 376 questionnaires returned, 339 were valid (90.2%). During the period of semi-lockdown, both females and males with BMI <24 gained weight, males with BMI &#8805;24 lost weight, and females with BMI &#8805;24 gained weight. The average steps per day and the average moderate or vigorous-intensity exercise declined significantly for both males and females during the semi-lockdown. Changes in body weight inversely correlated with changes in steps per day and moderate or vigorous-intensity exercise during the quarantine. CONCLUSIONS: Normal weight individuals, who are not normally troubled by overweight or obesity, had less awareness of weight gain than people with a BMI &#8805; 24.

The epidemiological implications of this phenomenon is that the classical epidemiological requirement of making R 0less than unity is only a necessary, but not sufficient for effectively controlling the spread of COVID-19 outbreak. It is observed that the system undergoes backward bifurcation which is a new observation for COVID-19 disease transmission model. We also noticed that under the perfect lockdown scenario, there is no possibility of having backward bifurcation. Using Lyapunov function theory and LaSalle Invariance Principle, the DFE is shown globally asymptotically stable for perfect lockdown model. We have calibrated our proposed model parameters to fit daily data from India, Mexico, South Africa and Argentina. We have provided a short-term prediction for India, Mexico, South Africa and Argentina of future cases of COVID-19. We calculate the basic reproduction number from the estimated parameters. We further assess the impact of lockdown during the outbreak. Furthermore, we find that effective lockdown is very necessary to reduce the burden of diseases.","Nadim, Sk Shahid; Chattopadhyay, Joydev",Chaos Solitons Fractals,,217
217941,An effective screening and management process in the outpatient clinic for patients requiring hospitalization during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"This paper illustrates five different techniques to assess the distinctiveness of topics, key terms and features, speed of information dissemination, and network behaviors for Covid19 tweets. First, we use pattern matching and second, topic modeling through Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to generate twenty different topics that discuss case spread, healthcare workers, and personal protective equipment (PPE). One topic specific to U.S. cases would start to uptick immediately after live White House Coronavirus Task Force briefings, implying that many Twitter users are paying attention to government announcements. We contribute machine learning methods not previously reported in the Covid19 Twitter literature. This includes our third method, Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), that identifies unique clustering-behavior of distinct topics to improve our understanding of important themes in the corpus and help assess the quality of generated topics. Fourth, we calculated retweeting times to understand how fast information about Covid19 propagates on Twitter. Our analysis indicates that the median retweeting time of Covid19 for a sample corpus in March 2020 was 2.87 hours, approximately 50 minutes faster than repostings from Chinese social media about H7N9 in March 2013. Lastly, we sought to understand retweet cascades, by visualizing the connections of users over time from fast to slow retweeting. As the time to retweet increases, the density of connections also increase where in our sample, we found distinct users dominating the attention of Covid19 retweeters. One of the simplest highlights of this analysis is that early-stage descriptive methods like regular expressions can successfully identify high-level themes which were consistently verified as important through every subsequent analysis.","Ordun, Catherine; Purushotham, Sanjay; Raff, Edward",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.03082v1.pdf,217
218617,"The relationship between chronotype, sleep, and autism symptom severity in children with ASD in COVID-19 home confinement period",2020,"OBJECTIVE: Vaccine hesitancy is a complex public health issue referring to concerns about safety, efficacy, or need for vaccination. Using pneumococcal vaccination, which is recommend in anti-CD20-treated multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, as a model, we assessed vaccination behavior in patients with MS to prepare for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 vaccination challenge. METHODS: By a medical chart review, we retrospectively identified patients with MS treated with ocrelizumab at the University Hospital Bern in 2018-2020. Pneumococcal vaccination was discussed with the patients during clinical visits and highlighted in the after-visit summary addressed to the general practitioner before ocrelizumab initiation as part of our clinical standard of care. RESULTS: Pneumococcal vaccination was performed in 71/121 (58.7%) of patients, and 50/121 (41.3%) patients were not vaccinated. Patients who did not get a pneumococcal vaccination were younger (no vaccination vs vaccination; mean [95% CI] 40.1 [36.1-44.1] vs 45.4 [41.9-48.8], p = 0.028) and had more frequently a relapsing remitting disease course (no vaccination vs vaccination, n [%]; 43/50 [86.0%] vs 49/71 [69.0%], p = 0.031). Furthermore, patients who did not get vaccination had more frequently a history of comorbid psychiatric disorder (no vaccination vs vaccination, n (%); 12/50 [24.0] vs 7/71 [9.8], p = 0.035). CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that in our single-center cohort, 41.3% of patients with MS do not get the recommended pneumococcal vaccination. Future research should focus on vaccine hesitancy in the vulnerable cohort of patients with MS to improve the safety of MS immunotherapies.","Diem, Lara; Friedli, Christoph; Chan, Andrew; Salmen, Anke; Hoepner, Robert",,,217
219942,Impact of COVID-19 on Trauma Surgical Education at a Level 1 Trauma Center,2021,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic requires appropriate measures for containing infection spreading. Endoscopic procedures are considered at increased risk of infection transmission. We evaluated organizational aspects and personal behaviours in Italian Endoscopic Units during phase II of the pandemic. METHODS: A questionnaire on organizational aspects and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) were e-mailed to gastroenterologists working in Endoscopic Units. Data were analysed accordingly to the National Health Institute and Gastroenterology Societies recommendations. RESULTS: Data of 117 centres were collected, and different shortcomings emerged. Specific protocols for containing infection and training programs for operators were lacking in 20 and 30% of centres, respectively, and telephone triage 24-72 h before the endoscopy was not implemented in 25% of hospitals. In 30% of centres, the slot time for endoscopies and between examinations was not prolonged. PPE, masks, shirts and gloves were universally adopted, although with some differences. In 20% of centres, a FFPE-FFP3 mask was not adopted during endoscopic examinations. Postendoscopy patient tracking/contact was completed in only one-third of centres. CONCLUSIONS: Our survey provides information on organizational and medical behaviours during COVID-19 phase II in Italy, which could be useful for adopting appropriate measures for containing COVID-19 spread during phase II.","Vassallo, Roberto; Venezia, Ludovica; Zullo, Angelo; Stasi, Elisa; Milazzo, Giuseppe; Soncini, Marco; Triossi, Omero; Neri Bortoluzzi, Francesco; Montalto, Paolo; Usai Satta, Paolo; Monica, Fabio",Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol,,217

Primary acrocyanosis is a distinct, rare condition which may be missed resulting in misdiagnosis and mismanagement. Primary acrocyanosis is a peripheral vascular disorder defined by painless, symmetrical discoloration of the distal appendages and uniquely characterized by persistence of the skin color changes after cold exposure. We present a case of a 24-year-old female who presented to the Emergency Department with peripheral cyanosis after cold exposure and was eventually diagnosed with primary acrocyanosis by Rheumatology. The prognosis for primary acrocyanosis is quite good in comparison to other acrosyndromes and once secondary causes of acrocyanosis have been ruled, out can be managed conservatively with lifestyle modifications and potential follow-up with Rheumatology.","Kent, Jessica T; Carr, David",Am. j. emerg. med,,217

We aimed to assess the psychiatric and neuropsychiatric presentations of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature databases (from their inception until March 18, 2020), and medRxiv, bioRxiv, and PsyArXiv (between Jan 1, 2020, and April 10, 2020) were searched by two independent researchers for all English-language studies or preprints reporting data on the psychiatric and neuropsychiatric presentations of individuals with suspected or laboratory-confirmed coronavirus infection (SARS coronavirus, MERS coronavirus, or SARS coronavirus 2). We excluded studies limited to neurological complications without specified neuropsychiatric presentations and those investigating the indirect effects of coronavirus infections on the mental health of people who are not infected, such as those mediated through physical distancing measures such as self-isolation or quarantine. Outcomes were psychiatric signs or symptoms; symptom severity; diagnoses based on ICD-10, DSM-IV, or the Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders (third edition) or psychometric scales; quality of life; and employment. Both the systematic review and the meta-analysis stratified outcomes across illness stages (acute vs post-illness) for SARS and MERS. We used a random-effects model for the meta-analysis, and the meta-analytical effect size was prevalence for relevant outcomes, I2 statistics, and assessment of study quality. FINDINGS: 1963 studies and 87 preprints were identified by the systematic search, of which 65 peer-reviewed studies and seven preprints met inclusion criteria. The number of coronavirus cases of the included studies was 3559, ranging from 1 to 997, and the mean age of participants in studies ranged from 12·2 years (SD 4·1) to 68·0 years (single case report). Studies were from China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Canada, Saudi Arabia, France, Japan, Singapore, the UK, and the USA. Follow-up time for the post-illness studies varied between 60 days and 12 years. The systematic review revealed that during the acute illness, common symptoms among patients admitted to hospital for SARS or MERS included confusion (36 [27·9%; 95% CI 20·5-36·0] of 129 patients), depressed mood (42 [32·6%; 24·7-40·9] of 129), anxiety (46 [35·7%; 27·6-44·2] of 129), impaired memory (44 [34·1%; 26·2-42·5] of 129), and insomnia (54 [41·9%; 22·5-50·5] of 129). Steroid-induced mania and psychosis were reported in 13 (0·7%) of 1744 patients with SARS in the acute stage in one study. In the post-illness stage, depressed mood (35 [10·5%; 95% CI 7·5-14·1] of 332 patients), insomnia (34 [12·1%; 8·6-16·3] of 280), anxiety (21 [12·3%; 7·7-17·7] of 171), irritability (28 [12·8%; 8·7-17·6] of 218), memory impairment (44 [18·9%; 14·1-24·2] of 233), fatigue (61 [19·3%; 15·1-23·9] of 316), and in one study traumatic memories (55 [30·4%; 23·9-37·3] of 181) and sleep disorder (14 [100·0%; 88·0-100·0] of 14) were frequently reported. The meta-analysis indicated that in the post-illness stage the point prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder was 32·2% (95% CI 23·7-42·0; 121 of 402 cases from four studies), that of depression was 14·9% (12·1-18·2; 77 of 517 cases from five studies), and that of anxiety disorders was 14·8% (11·1-19·4; 42 of 284 cases from three studies). 446 (76·9%; 95% CI 68·1-84·6) of 580 patients from six studies had returned to work at a mean follow-up time of 35·3 months (SD 40·1). When data for patients with COVID-19 were examined (including preprint data), there was evidence for delirium (confusion in 26 [65%] of 40 intensive care unit patients and agitation in 40 [69%] of 58 intensive care unit patients in one study, and altered consciousness in 17 [21%] of 82 patients who subsequently died in another study). At discharge, 15 (33%) of 45 patients with COVID-19 who were assessed had a dysexecutive syndrome in one study. At the time of writing, there were two reports of hypoxic encephalopathy and one report of encephalitis. 68 (94%) of the 72 studies were of either low or medium quality. INTERPRETATION: If infection with SARS-CoV-2 follows a similar course to that with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, most patients should recover without experiencing mental illness. SARS-CoV-2 might cause delirium in a significant proportion of patients in the acute stage. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of depression, anxiety, fatigue, post-traumatic stress disorder, and rarer neuropsychiatric syndromes in the longer term.

We suggest that though the results of two-phase III double-blind clinical trials have been less than expected, tocilizumab has a real remaining potential to treat selected critical cases of COVID-19 beyond clinical trials until more data are revealed. On the contrary, remdesivir, though its FDA approval, and favipiravir are least likely to benefit COVID-19 patients. Moreover, we recommend that the RECOVERY dexamethasone should only be considered for critical hospitalized COVID-19 patients and we urge physicians in developing countries to avoid using it in mild-moderate COVID-19 cases. Finally, we recommend considering a personalized risk-benefit ratio before a decision is made using any of these drugs.","Kelleni, Mina T",SN Compr Clin Med,,217

The correlates of QOL of NISs with their gender, age, prior nursing experience, and general point average (GPA) from the previous semester are also assessed. Methods This study used a quantitative cross-sectional design through an electronic survey form for the collection of required data. The 22-item Quality of Life Evaluation Scale (QOLES) was adopted as the survey instrument. A total of 283 NISs from five public universities in KSA completed the survey. Results The students' age, gender, and nursing-related experience prior to their internship were all found to be significantly associated with the overall QOLES score (p values of 0.001, 0.001, and 0.01, respectively). The NISs GPA was found to be marginally significant (p = 0.08). A significant difference was identified in the overall QOLES score based on age (p = 0.02), gender (p = 0.02), and GPA (p = &lt;0.001). Finally, as estimated by the regression analysis, only age (p = 0.002) was found to be a significant predictor of NISs’ QoL. Conclusion In this study, the QoL of Saudi NISs was positively correlated with their age and gender. Male NISs had greater QoL than females, while a high QoL was observed among students with high GPAs before the internship year. Only the age of the NISs was found to be a reliable predictor of QoL.","Grande, Rizal Angelo N.; Berdida, Daniel Joseph E.; Maniago, Jestoni D.; Ablao, Jay Nantin Llaguno Maria Blesilda B.; Manood, Edgar Gatioan",Journal of Taibah University Medical Sciences,,217

221253,Non-COVID area of a tertiary care hospital: A major source of nosocomial COVID-19 transmission,2020,"The recent exposure of novel coronavirus strain, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) has spread to different countries at an alarming rate. Faster transmission rate and genetic modifications have provoked scientists to search for an immediate solution. With an increasing death rate, it becomes important to throw some light on the life cycle of the virus and its associated pathogenesis in the form of lung inflammation through cytokine storm (CS) production. This paper highlights the different stages of viral-mediated inflammatory responses in the host respiratory system. Previously, known anti-inflammatory drugs and therapeutic strategies that might show potential in controlling the CS of Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is also mentioned in this study. Our critical analysis provides insights into the inflammation cycle induced in the lungs by early virus replication, downregulation and shedding of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and in the CS production. Identification of suitable targets within the inflammatory pathways for devising the therapeutic strategies useful in controlling the prognosis of COVID-19 finds a special mention in this article. However, antibody-dependent enhancement is the key aspect to consider before testing any drug/compound for therapeutic purposes. Our in-depth analysis would provide similarities and differences between the inflammatory responses induced by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, providing an excellent avenue to further look at how earlier outbreaks of coronaviruses were controlled and where new steps are required?","Asrani, Purva; Hassan, Md Imtaiyaz",Mol. cell. biochem,,217

Previous studies have suggested significant declines in cases of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We performed a quasi-experimental, retrospective cohort study of ACS hospitalisations by using a multi-institutional administrative claims database in Japan. We used interrupted time series analyses to ascertain impacts on cases, treatment approaches, and in-hospital mortality before and after Japan's state of emergency to respond to COVID-19. The primary outcome was the change in ACS cases per week. RESULTS: A total of 30,198 ACS cases (including 21,612 acute myocardial infarction and 8,586 unstable angina) were confirmed between 1st July 2018 and 30th June 2020. After the state of emergency, an immediate decrease was observed in ACS cases per week (-18.3%; 95% confidence interval, -13.1 to -23.5%). No significant differences were found in the severity of Killip classification (P=0.51) or cases of fibrinolytic therapy (P=0.74). The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on in-hospital mortality in ACS patients was no longer observed after adjustment for clinical characteristics (adjusted odds ratio, 0.93; 95% confidence interval, 0.78 to 1.12; P=0.49). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the characteristics and trends of ACS cases in a Japanese population by applying interrupted time series analyses. Our findings provide significant insights into the association between COVID-19 and decreases in ACS hospitalisations during the pandemic.","Morishita, Tetsuji; Takada, Daisuke; Shin, Jung-Ho; Higuchi, Takuya; Kunisawa, Susumu; Imanaka, Yuichi",J. atheroscler. thromb,,217
224520,Where Have All the Emergencies Gone? The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on obstetric and gynecologic procedures and consults at a New York City hospital,2020,"BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether insulin resistance (IR) contributes to excess mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes independent of diabetic kidney disease (DKD), which is strongly associated with IR and is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), the main cause of death in these individuals. We tested this hypothesis in patients with type 2 diabetes from the Renal Insufficiency And Cardiovascular Events Italian Multicentre Study. METHODS: This observational, prospective, cohort study enrolled 15,773 patients with type 2 diabetes attending 19 Italian Diabetes Clinics in 2006-2008. Insulin sensitivity was assessed as estimated glucose disposal rate (eGDR), which was validated against the euglycaemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp technique. Vital status on October 31, 2015, was retrieved for 15,656 patients (99.3%). Participants were stratified by eGDR tertiles from T1 (&#8805; 5.35 mg/kg/min) to T3 (&#8804; 4.14 mg/kg/min, highest IR). RESULTS: CVD risk profile was worse in T2 and T3 vs T1. eGDR tertiles were independently associated with micro- and macroalbuminuria and the albuminuric DKD phenotypes (albuminuria with preserved or reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]) as well as with eGFR categories or the nonalbuminuric DKD phenotype. Over a 7.4-year follow-up, unadjusted death rates and mortality risks increased progressively across eGDR tertiles, but remained significantly elevated after adjustment only in T3 vs T1 (age- and gender- adjusted death rate, 22.35 vs 16.74 per 1000 person-years, p < 0.0001, and hazard ratio [HR] adjusted for multiple confounders including DKD, 1.140 [95% confidence interval [CI], 1.049-1.238], p = 0.002). However, eGDR was independently associated with mortality in participants with no DKD (adjusted HR, 1.214 [95% CI, 1.072-1.375], p = 0.002) and in those with nonalbuminuric DKD (1.276 [1.034-1.575], p = 0.023), but not in those with the albuminuric DKD phenotypes. Moreover, the association was stronger in males and in younger individuals and was observed in those without but not with prior CVD, though interaction was significant only for age. CONCLUSIONS: The proxy of insulin sensitivity eGDR predicts all-cause mortality in type 2 diabetes, independent of confounders including DKD. However, the impact of IR in individuals with albuminuric DKD may be mediated by its relationship with albuminuria.

Another key epidemiological parameter-asymptomatic ratio that provides strength and range for social alienation strategies of COVID-19, which is widely defined as the proportion of asymptomatic infections among all disease infections. In fact, the ratio of asymptomatic infection is a useful indicator of the burden of disease and a better measurement of the transmissibility of the virus.

The aim of this paper is to describe the pharmacokinetics of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients, considered to be a key step toward its dosing optimization. METHODS: We have developed a population pharmacokinetic model for hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients using prospectively collected pharmacokinetic data from patients either enrolled in a clinical trial or treated with hydroxychloroquine as part of standard of care in two tertiary Belgian hospitals. RESULTS: The final population pharmacokinetic model was a one-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination. The estimated parameter values were 9.3/h, 860.8 L, and 15.7 L/h for the absorption rate constant, the central compartment volume, and the clearance, respectively. The bioavailability factor was fixed to 0.74 based on previously published models. Model validations by bootstraps, prediction corrected visual predictive checks, and normalized prediction distribution errors gave satisfactory results. Simulations were performed to compare the exposure obtained with alternative dosing regimens. CONCLUSION: The developed models provide useful insight for the dosing optimization of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients. The present results should be used in conjunction with exposure-efficacy and exposure-safety data to inform optimal dosing of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19.","Thémans, Pauline; Belkhir, Leila; Dauby, Nicolas; Yombi, Jean-Cyr; De Greef, Julien; Delongie, Kevin-Alexandre; Vandeputte, Martin; Nasreddine, Rakan; Wittebole, Xavier; Wuillaume, Francoise; Lescrainier, Cécile; Verlinden, Veerle; Kiridis, Sophie; Dogné, Jean-Michel; Hamdani, Jamila; Wallemacq, Pierre; Musuamba, Flora T",Eur J Drug Metab Pharmacokinet,,217

226887,Surgical Residents at the Forefront of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Perspectives on Redeployment,2021,"BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular involvement in SARS-CoV-2 infection has emerged as one of viral major clinical features during actual pandemic; limb arterial ischemic events, venous thrombosis, acute myocardial infection and stroke have occurred in patients. Acute aortic conditions have also been described, followed by interesting observations on cases, hypothesis, raised since the emergence of the pandemics. METHODS: a review of cases in literature of aortic pathology in patients with clinically suspected/microbiologically confirmed COVID-19 infection has been carried out to analyze anagraphic data, clinical presentation, treatment options and outcome. RESULTS: Seventeen cases have been included. Mean age of patients was 58.6 ± 15.2 years, with a male to female ratio of 12:15 (70.5% vs. 29.5%). Comorbidities were reported in 11 cases (64.7%), but in 5 cases (29.4%) no previous pathology was signaled in history. Hypertension was the most frequently reported comorbidity, in 8 cases, (47%), followed by renal pathology (17.6%), coronary artery disease (17.6%), previous aortic surgery (11.7%) and arrhythmia (11.7%); but also cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, autoimmune conditions, previous neoplasia and arrhythmia were reported once each. Fever and thoracic pain were the most frequently reported findings at presentation (8 cases, 47% each), followed by respiratory symptoms (6, 35.2%), low lymphocyte count (17.6%), features related to aneurysm rupture, ischemic stroke, abdominal pain and acute renal insufficiency. Reported aortic pathology included: type A aortic dissection (11 cases; 64.7%); new pathology of previous aortic graft (2 cases, 11.7%); 2 aortitis, 1 associated with type A aortic dissection; 1 thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysm, 1 ruptured aortic aneurysm and 1 aortic embolizing thrombosis. Open surgery was carried out in 10 cases (58.8%), endovascular treatment in 3 (17.6%). Three patients (17.6%) died before surgery. Exitus was reported in 4 cases, with a total mortality of 23.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Acute aortic events have occurred during pandemic in patients with clinically suspected/microbiologically confirmed COVID-19 infection. Confounding clinical features at presentation, the importance of anamnestic details (as previous vascular graft implant), the observed surgical and postoperatory challenges may suggest the need to consider the implications of the possible link between acute aortic events and SARS-CoV-2 infection, in order to promptly correctly diagnose the patient and respond to specific needs.","Silvestri, Valeria; Recchia, Gregorio Egidio",Ann. vasc. surg,,217

In the United States, allocation frameworks are determined by each of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 64 jurisdictions (50 states, the District of Columbia, five cities and eight territories). In this study, we analyzed vaccine allocation plans published by 8 November 2020, tracking updates through to 30 March 2021. We evaluated whether jurisdictions adopted proposals to reduce inequity using disadvantage indices and related place-based measures. By 30 March 2021, 14 jurisdictions had prioritized specific zip codes in combination with metrics such as COVID-19 incidence, and 37 jurisdictions (including 34 states) had adopted disadvantage indices, compared to 19 jurisdictions in November 2020. Uptake of indices doubled from 7 to 14 among the jurisdictions with the largest shares of disadvantaged communities. Five applications were distinguished: (1) prioritizing disadvantaged groups through increased shares of vaccines or vaccination appointments; (2) defining priority groups or areas; (3) tailoring outreach and communication; (4) planning the location of dispensing sites; and (5) monitoring receipt. To ensure that equity features centrally in allocation plans, policymakers at the federal, state and local levels should universalize the uptake of disadvantage indices and related place-based measures.","Schmidt, Harald; Weintraub, Rebecca; Williams, Michelle A; Miller, Kate; Buttenheim, Alison; Sadecki, Emily; Wu, Helen; Doiphode, Aditi; Nagpal, Neha; Gostin, Lawrence O; Shen, Angela A",Nat Med,,217

Existing compressive sensing based defence schemes assume that adversarial perturbations are usually on high frequency components, whereas recently it has been shown that low frequency perturbations are more effective. This paper proposes a novel Compressive sensing based Adaptive Defence (CAD) algorithm which combats distortion in frequency domain instead of time domain. Unlike existing literature, the proposed CAD algorithm does not use information about the type of attack such as l0, l2, l-infinity etc. CAD algorithm uses exponential weight algorithm for exploration and exploitation to identify the type of attack, compressive sampling matching pursuit (CoSaMP) to recover the coefficients in spectral domain, and modified basis pursuit using a novel constraint for l0, l-infinity norm attack. Tight performance bounds for various recovery schemes meant for various attack types are also provided. Experimental results against five state-of-the-art white box attacks on MNIST and CIFAR-10 show that the proposed CAD algorithm achieves excellent classification accuracy and generates good quality reconstructed image with much lower computation","Gupta, Akash Kumar; Chattopadhyay, Arpan; Yadav, Darpan Kumar",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.05077v1.pdf,217
229833,Implementation of Simulation Training During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A New York Hospital Experience,2020,"The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic emphasizes the need to actively study the virome of unexplained respiratory diseases. We performed viral metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) analysis of 91 nasal-throat swabs from individuals working with animals and with acute respiratory diseases. Fifteen virus RT-PCR-positive samples were included as controls, while the other 76 samples were RT-PCR negative for a wide panel of respiratory pathogens. Eukaryotic viruses detected by mNGS were then screened by PCR (using primers based on mNGS-derived contigs) in all samples to compare viral detection by mNGS versus PCR and assess the utility of mNGS in routine diagnostics. mNGS identified expected human rhinoviruses, enteroviruses, influenza A virus, coronavirus OC43, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A in 13 of 15 (86.7%) positive control samples. Additionally, rotavirus, torque teno virus, human papillomavirus, human betaherpesvirus 7, cyclovirus, vientovirus, gemycircularvirus, and statovirus were identified through mNGS. Notably, complete genomes of novel cyclovirus, gemycircularvirus, and statovirus were genetically characterized. Using PCR screening, the novel cyclovirus was additionally detected in 5 and the novel gemycircularvirus in 12 of the remaining samples included for mNGS analysis. Our studies therefore provide pioneering data of the virome of acute-respiratory diseases from individuals at risk of zoonotic infections. The mNGS protocol/pipeline applied here is sensitive for the detection of a variety of viruses, including novel ones. More frequent detections of the novel viruses by PCR than by mNGS on the same samples suggests that PCR remains the most sensitive diagnostic test for viruses whose genomes are known. The detection of novel viruses expands our understanding of the respiratory virome of animal-exposed humans and warrant further studies.","Thi Kha Tu, Nguyen; Thi Thu Hong, Nguyen; Thi Han Ny, Nguyen; My Phuc, Tran; Thi Thanh Tam, Pham; Doorn, H Rogier van; Dang Trung Nghia, Ho; Thao Huong, Dang; An Han, Duong; Thi Thu Ha, Luu; Deng, Xutao; Thwaites, Guy; Delwart, Eric; Virtala, Anna-Maija K; Vapalahti, Olli; Baker, Stephen; Van Tan, Le",Viruses,,217

Objective: To evaluate the in vitro efficacy of PVP-I nasal antiseptic for the inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 at clinically significant contact times of 15 and 30 seconds. Interventions: The SARS-CoV-2, USA-WA1/2020 strain, virus stock was tested against nasal antiseptic solutions consisting of aqueous PVP-I as the sole active ingredient. Povidone-iodine was tested at diluted concentrations of 0.5%, 1.25%, and 2.5% and compared with controls. The test solutions and virus were incubated at mean (SD) room temperature of 22 (2) °C for time periods of 15 and 30 seconds. Design and Setting: This controlled in vitro laboratory research study used 3 different concentrations of study solution and ethanol, 70%, as a positive control on test media infected with SARS-CoV-2. Test media without virus were added to 2 tubes of the compounds to serve as toxicity and neutralization controls. Ethanol, 70%, was tested in parallel as a positive control and water only as a negative control. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary study outcome measurement was the log reduction value after 15 seconds and 30 seconds of given treatment. Surviving virus from each sample was quantified by standard end point dilution assay, and the log reduction value of each compound was compared with the negative (water) control. Results: Povidone-iodine nasal antiseptics at concentrations (0.5%, 1.25%, and 2.5%) completely inactivated SARS-CoV-2 within 15 seconds of contact as measured by log reduction value of greater than 3 log10 of the 50% cell culture infectious dose of the virus. The ethanol, 70%, positive control did not completely inactivate SARS-CoV-2 after 15 seconds of contact. The nasal antiseptics tested performed better than the standard positive control routinely used for in vitro assessment of anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents at a contact time of 15 seconds. No cytotoxic effects on cells were observed after contact with each of the nasal antiseptics tested. Conclusions and Relevance: Povidone-iodine nasal antiseptic solutions at concentrations as low as 0.5% rapidly inactivate SARS-CoV-2 at contact times as short as 15 seconds. Intranasal use of PVP-I has demonstrated safety at concentrations of 1.25% and below and may play an adjunctive role in mitigating viral transmission beyond personal protective equipment.","Frank, Samantha; Brown, Seth M; Capriotti, Joseph A; Westover, Jonna B; Pelletier, Jesse S; Tessema, Belachew",JAMA otolaryngol.-- head neck surg.

The aim of this study was to understand the level of depression as a result of the COVID-19 situation and possible associations with sociodemographic variables. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: It's a cross-sectional study. The participants were 155 respondents recruited online in the period 27.04.2020 until 05.06.2020, who completed the Albanian version of PHQ-9. RESULTS: Mean score of depression resulted 10.94 (SD=9.22). 63% of participants agreed that the situation has worsened their psychological state; 35.6% had a mild to severe form of depression and 18.7% had minimal symptoms. 13.4% of participants saw iCBT as helpful, 16.8% a little while 65.8% wanted to try it. Significantly higher depression resulted for females and age-group 18 to 24 years. No significant differences by levels of education, marital status, employment, socio-economic status and by expectations regarding iCBT. Gender and perception of worsened psychological state showed predictive abilities for depression. CONCLUSION: The situation with Covid-19 has increased depression levels especially among females and 18 to 24 years old and thus expectations for e-psychotherapy.

232101,COVID-19 and potential global mortality - Revisited,2020,"Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters are ubiquitous and versatile inorganic cofactors that are crucial for many fundamental bioprocesses in nearly all organisms. How cells maintain Fe-S cluster homeostasis is not well understood in Gram-positive bacteria. Genomic analysis showed that the Suf system, which is encoded by the sufRBDCSU operon, is the sole Fe-S cluster assembly system in the genus Streptomyces Streptomyces avermitilis is the industrial producer of avermectins, which are widely used as agricultural pesticides and antiparasitic agents. sufR (SAV6324) encodes a putative ArsR-family transcriptional regulator, which was characterized as a repressor of the sufRBDCSU operon in this investigation. Spectroscopy and mass spectrometry demonstrated that anaerobically isolated SufR contained an oxidation-sensitive [4Fe-4S] cluster and existed as a homodimer. EMSAs and DNase I footprinting analyses revealed that [4Fe-4S]-SufR bound specifically and tightly to a 14-bp palindromic sequence (CAAC-N6-GTTG) in the promoter region of the sufR operon, repressing expression of the sufRBDCSU operon. The presence of the [4Fe-4S] cluster is critical for the DNA binding activity of SufR. Cys182, Cys195, and Cys223 in the C-terminal region of SufR are essential for [4Fe-4S] cluster coordination, but Cys178 is not. The fourth non-Cys ligand in coordination of the [4Fe-4S] cluster for SufR remains to be identified. The findings clarify the transcriptional control of the suf operon by [4Fe-4S] SufR to satisfy the varying Fe-S cluster demands. SufR senses the intracellular Fe-S cluster status and modulates the expression of the sole Fe-S cluster assembly system via its Fe-S cluster occupancy.Importance Fe-S clusters function as cofactors of proteins controlling diverse biological processes such as respiration, photosynthesis, nitrogen fixation, DNA replication and gene regulation. The mechanism of how Actinobacteria regulate the expression of the sole Fe-S cluster assembly system in response to the varying Fe-S cluster demands remains to be elucidated. In this study, we showed that SufR functions as a transcriptional repressor of the sole Fe-S cluster assembly system in the avermectin-producer S. avermitilis [4Fe-4S]-SufR binds to the promoter region of the suf operon and represses its expression. When Fe-S cluster is insufficient, SufR loses its [4Fe-4S] cluster and DNA binding activity. Apo-SufR dissociates from the promoter region of suf operon, and the expression of the suf system is strongly increased by de-repression to promote the synthesis of Fe-S clusters. The study clarifies how Streptomyces maintains its Fe-S cluster homeostasis through the activity of SufR to modulate the varying Fe-S cluster demands.","Cheng, Yaqing; Lyu, Mengya; Yang, Renjun; Wen, Ying; Song, Yuan; Li, Jilun; Chen, Zhi",,,217

How immune cell subsets change during the disease course and with disease severity needs further study. While myeloid cells have been shown to initiate and maintain responses to pneumonia and lung inflammation, often playing a role in resolution, their involvement with COVID-19 remains unknown. In this issue of the JCI, Sánchez-Cerrillo and Landete et al. investigated DCs and monocytes from blood and bronchial secretions of patients with varying COVID-19 severity and with healthy controls. The authors conclude that circulating monocytes and DCs migrate from the blood into the inflamed lungs. While sampling differences in sex, collection timing, bacteria/fungal infection, and corticosteroid treatment limit interpretation, we believe that reprogramming monocyte or macrophages by targeting immunometabolism, epigenetics, or the cytokine milieu holds promise in resolving lung inflammation associated with COVID-19.","D039,; Alessio, Franco R; Heller, Nicola M",J Clin Invest,,217

The first reports of patients with COVID-19 were provided to World Health Organization on December 21, 2019 and were presumably associated with seafood markets in Wuhan, China. As of October 25, 2020, more than 42 million cases have been confirmed worldwide, with more than 1.1 million deaths. Asymptomatic transmission contributes significantly to transmission, and clinical features are non-specific to the disease. Thus, the diagnosis of COVID-19 requires specific viral RNA testing. The disease demonstrates extensive human-to-human transmissibility and has infected healthcare workers at high rates. Clinical awareness of the epidemiology and the risk factors for nosocomial transmission of COVID-19 is essential to preventing infection. Moreover, effective control measures should be further identified by comprehensive evaluation of hospital and community responses. In this review, we provide a comprehensive update on the epidemiology, presentation, transmission, risk factors, and public health measures associated with COVID-19.

235040,[Risk stratification of emergencies during the COVID-19 pandemic within the emergency department],2020,"Effective and rapid detection of lesions in the Gastrointestinal tract is critical to gastroenterologist's response to some life-threatening diseases. Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) has revolutionized traditional endoscopy procedure by allowing gastroenterologists visualize the entire GI tract non-invasively. Once the tiny capsule is swallowed, it sequentially capture images of the GI tract at about 2 to 6 frames per second (fps). A single video can last up to 8 hours producing between 30,000 to 100,000 images. Automating the detection of frames containing specific lesion in WCE video would relieve gastroenterologists the arduous task of reviewing the entire video before making diagnosis. While the WCE produces large volume of images, only about 5\% of the frames contain lesions that aid the diagnosis process. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based models have been very successful in various image classification tasks. However, they suffer excessive parameters, are sample inefficient and rely on very large amount of training data. Deploying a CNN classifier for lesion detection task will require time-to-time fine-tuning to generalize to any unforeseen category. In this paper, we propose a metric-based learning framework followed by a few-shot lesion recognition in WCE data. Metric-based learning is a meta-learning framework designed to establish similarity or dissimilarity between concepts while few-shot learning (FSL) aims to identify new concepts from only a small number of examples. We train a feature extractor to learn a representation for different small bowel lesions using metric-based learning. At the testing stage, the category of an unseen sample is predicted from only a few support examples, thereby allowing the model to generalize to a new category that has never been seen before. We demonstrated the efficacy of this method on real patient capsule endoscopy data.","Adewole, Sodiq; Fernandez, Philip; Yeghyayan, Michelle; Jablonski, James; Copland, Andrew; Porter, Michael; Syed, Sana; Brown, Donald",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.04240v2.pdf,217

235525,The Management Of Neurosurgical Patients During The Covid-19 Pandemic,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The management of laryngotracheal stenosis is challenging, as patients usually require in-time interventions. The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has added unique challenges to this procedure. The presence of the virus in high concentrations in the aerodigestive tract and the need for an open airway during surgery can increase the risk of aerosolization of the virus and subsequent infection of the surgical, anesthetic, and operating room (OR) personnel. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: University hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Patients who underwent airway interventions between March and October 2020. INTERVENTIONS: A protocolized strategy was initiated during the COVID-19 pandemic to facilitate the consistent management of all patients undergoing airway interventions. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: During a seven-month period, 34 patients were managed with this policy. All threatened airways were managed successfully and no healthcare workers dealing with such procedures were infected. Priorities during the current novel coronavirus pandemic are ensuring the safety of healthcare professionals and offering urgent bronchoscopic and surgical airway interventions for patients with progressive symptoms and threatened airways. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical and bronchoscopic management of laryngotracheal stenosis presents a unique challenge during the COVID-19 pandemic, requiring careful consideration of patient triage and the development of protocols that minimize risk to patients and healthcare professionals. Close collaboration between thoracic surgeons and anesthesiology teams is essential to safely navigate and handle these threatened airways while mitigating the risk of viral aerosolization.","Elsayed, Hany Hasan; Moharram, Assem Adel",J. cardiothoracic vasc. anest,,217

The Global Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2/hCoV-19 Sequences (GESS, https://wan-bioinfo.shinyapps.io/GESS/) is a resource to provide comprehensive analysis results based on tens of thousands of high-coverage and high-quality SARS-CoV-2 complete genomes. The database allows user to browse, search and download SNVs at any individual or multiple SARS-CoV-2 genomic positions, or within a chosen genomic region or protein, or in certain country/area of interest. GESS reveals geographical distributions of SNVs around the world and across the states of USA, while exhibiting time-dependent patterns for SNV occurrences which reflect development of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. For each month, the top 100 SNVs that were firstly identified world-widely can be retrieved. GESS also explores SNVs occurring simultaneously with specific SNVs of user's interests. Furthermore, the database can be of great help to calibrate mutation rates and identify conserved genome regions. Taken together, GESS is a powerful resource and tool to monitor SARS-CoV-2 migration and evolution according to featured genomic variations. It provides potential directive information for prevalence prediction, related public health policy making, and vaccine designs.","Fang, Shuyi; Li, Kailing; Shen, Jikui; Liu, Sheng; Liu, Juli; Yang, Lei; Hu, Chang-Deng; Wan, Jun",Nucleic acids res,,217

237816,Management of Neurosurgical Cases in a Tertiary Care Referral Hospital During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Lessons From a Middle-Income Country,2020,"BACKGROUND: India was one of the countries to institute strict measures for Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) control in the early phase. Since, then, the epidemic growth trajectory was slow before registering an explosion of cases due to local cluster transmissions. METHODS: We estimated the growth rate and doubling time of SARS-CoV-2 for India and high burden states using crowdsourced time series data. Further, we also estimated the Basic Reproductive Number (R0) and Time-dependent Reproductive number (Rt) using serial intervals from the data. We compared the R0 estimated from five different methods and R0 from SB was further used in the analysis. We modified standard Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) models to SIR/Death (SIRD) model to accommodate deaths using R0 with the sequential Bayesian method for simulation in SIRD models. RESULTS: On average, 2.8 individuals were infected by an index case. The mean serial interval was 3.9 days. The R0 estimated from different methods ranged from 1.43 to 1.85. The mean time to recovery was 14 ± 5.3 days. The daily epidemic growth rate of India was 0.16 [95% CI; 0.14, 0.17] with a doubling time of 4.30 days [95% CI; 3.96, 4.70]. From the SIRD model, it can be deduced that the peak of SARS-CoV-2 in India will be around mid-July to early August 2020 with around 12.5% of the population likely to be infected at the peak time. CONCLUSION: The pattern of spread of SARS-CoV-2 in India is suggestive of community transmission. There is a need to increase funds for infectious disease research and epidemiologic studies. All the current gains may be reversed if air travel and social mixing resume rapidly. For the time being, these must be resumed only in a phased manner and should be back to normal levels only after we are prepared to deal with the disease with efficient tools like vaccines or medicine. KEY POINTS: . QUESTION: What are the estimates of infectious disease parameters of early phase of novel SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in India? FINDINGS: Incidence pattern SARS-CoV-2 shows possible evidence of community transmission. However, the estimated Basic Reproductive Number (R0) is relatively lower than those observed in high burden regions (range 1.43-1.85). Our simulation using susceptible-infectious-recovered/death model shows that peak of SARS-CoV-2 in India is farther than currently projected and is likely to affect around 12.5% of population. MEANING: The lower estimated R0 is indicative of the effectiveness of early social distancing measures and lockdown. Premature relaxation of the current control measures may result in large numbers of cases in India.","Rajendrakumar, Aravind Lathika; Nair, Anand Thakarakkattil Narayanan; Nangia, Charvi; Chourasia, Prabal Kumar; Chourasia, Mehul Kumar; Syed, Mohammed Ghouse; Nair, Anu Sasidharan; Nair, Arun B; Koya, Muhammed Shaffi Fazaludeen",Journal of epidemiology and global health (Online),,217
238121,Clinical dental care: Is there a risk of SARS-CoV2 infection?,2020,"Background: Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, public health policies to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and its associated disease, COVID-19, have resulted in significant alterations to daily routines (eg, work-from-home policies) that may have enabled longer sleep duration among the general population. Objective: We aimed to examine changes in estimated sleep duration in 5 major metropolitan areas before and after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study using estimated sleep duration data obtained from a smartphone app. The data were obtained from regular users of the smartphone app before and after the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic in March 2020. We compared within-subject estimated sleep duration before and during the COVID-19 pandemic using generalized linear mixed models. Results: Among the 2,871,037 observations, 957,022 (33.3%) were from users in London;549,151 (19.1%) were from users in Los Angeles;846,527 (29.5%) were from users in New York City;251,113 (8.7%) were from users in Seoul;and 267,224 (9.3%) were from users in Stockholm. The average age of the users in the sample was 35 years (SE 11 years). Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, people residing in Seoul had the shortest estimated sleep duration (mean 6 hours 28 minutes, SE 11.6 minutes) and those residing in Stockholm had the longest estimated sleep duration (mean 7 hours 34 minutes, SE 9.9 minutes). The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a 13.7 minute increase in estimated sleep duration when comparing March 2019 and March 2020 (95% CI 13.1-14.3, P<.001) and an increase of 22.3 minutes when comparing April 2019 and April 2020 (95% CI 21.5-23.1, P<.001). Conclusions: The average estimated sleep duration increased sharply in the months after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. This finding suggests that the implementation of COVID-19 mitigation strategies has provided people worldwide with increased opportunities to sleep, which may enhance the response of the immune system to viral pathogens.

The epidemic quickly broke out and spread throughout the country. Now it becomes a pandemic that affects the whole world. In this study, three models were used to fit and predict the epidemic situation in China: a modified SEIRD (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered-Dead) dynamic model, a neural network method LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), and a GWR (Geographically Weighted Regression) model reflecting spatial heterogeneity. Overall, all the three models performed well with great accuracy. The dynamic SEIRD prediction APE (absolute percent error) of China had been &#8804; 1.0% since Mid-February. The LSTM model showed comparable accuracy. The GWR model took into account the influence of geographical differences, with R2 = 99.98% in fitting and 97.95% in prediction. Wilcoxon test showed that none of the three models outperformed the other two at the significance level of 0.05. The parametric analysis of the infectious rate and recovery rate demonstrated that China's national policies had effectively slowed down the spread of the epidemic. Furthermore, the models in this study provided a wide range of implications for other countries to predict the short-term and long-term trend of COVID-19, and to evaluate the intensity and effect of their interventions.","Liu, Fenglin; Wang, Jie; Liu, Jiawen; Li, Yue; Liu, Dagong; Tong, Junliang; Li, Zhuoqun; Yu, Dan; Fan, Yifan; Bi, Xiaohui; Zhang, Xueting; Mo, Steven",PLoS One,,217

However, associated mechanisms and markers remain to be further investigated. This study aimed to investigate the effect of &#945;-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (&#945;-HBDH) levels on disease progression and prognosis of patients with COVID-19. METHODS AND RESULTS: One thousand seven hundred and fifty-one patients from the Leishenshan hospital in Wuhan were divided into elevated and normal groups by &#945;-HBDH level, and the clinical information between the two groups was compared retrospectively. The main outcome evaluation criteria included in-hospital death and disease severity. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses, survival curves, logistic regression, and receiver operating characteristic curve models were performed to explore the relationship between elevated &#945;-HBDH and the two outcomes. Besides, curve fitting analyses were conducted to analyse the relationship between computed tomography score and survival. Among 1751 patients with confirmed COVID-19, 15 patients (0.87%) died. The mean (SD) age of patients was 58 years in normal &#945;-HBDH group and 66 years in elevated &#945;-HBDH group (P < 0.001). The mortality during hospitalization was 0.26% (4 of 1559) for patients with normal &#945;-HBDH levels and 5.73% (11 of 192) for those with elevated &#945;-HBDH levels (P < 0.001). Multivariate Cox analysis confirmed an association between elevated &#945;-HBDH levels and higher risk of in-hospital mortality [hazard ratio: 4.411, 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.127-17.260; P = 0.033]. Multivariate logistic regression for disease severity and &#945;-HBDH levels showed significant difference between both groups (odds ratio = 3.759; 95% CI, 1.895-7.455; P < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier curves also illustrated the survival difference between normal and elevated &#945;-HBDH patients (P < 0.001).

A dataset of cellular phone recordings from 88 subjects was recently collected. The dataset included vocal utterances, speech and coughs that were self-recorded by the subjects in either hospitals or isolation sites. All subjects underwent nasopharyngeal swabbing at the time of recording and were labelled as SARS-CoV-2 positives or negative controls. The present study harnessed deep machine learning and speech processing to detect the SARS-CoV-2 positives. A three-stage architecture was implemented. A self-supervised attention-based transformer generated embeddings from the audio inputs. Recurrent neural networks were used to produce specialized sub-models for the SARS-CoV-2 classification. An ensemble stacking fused the predictions of the sub-models. Pre-training, bootstrapping and regularization techniques were used to prevent overfitting. A recall of 78% and a probability of false alarm (PFA) of 41% were measured on a test set of 57 recording sessions. A leave-one-speaker-out cross validation on 292 recording sessions yielded a recall of 78% and a PFA of 30%. These preliminary results imply a feasibility for COVID19 screening using voice.","Pinkas, Gadi Yarden Karny Aviad Malachi Barkai Galia Bachar Gideon Aharonson Vered",IEEE Open Journal of Engineering in Medicine and Biology,,217

Here, we present a user-interactive 3D touchless sensing display based on multiorder reflection structural colors (SCs) of a thin, solid-state block copolymer (BCP) photonic crystal (PC). Full-visible-range SCs are developed in a BCP PC consisting of alternating lamellae, one of which contains a chemically cross-linked, interpenetrated hydrogel network. The absorption of a nonvolatile ionic liquid into the domains of the interpenetrated network allows for further manipulation of SC by using multiple-order photonic reflections, giving rise to unprecedented visible SCs arising from reflective color mixing. Furthermore, by using a hygroscopic ionic liquid ink, a printable 3D touchless interactive display is created where 3D position of a human finger is efficiently visualized in different SCs as a function of finger-to-display distance.","Kang, Han Sol; Han, Sang Won; Park, Chanho; Lee, Seung Won; Eoh, Hongkyu; Baek, Jonghyeok; Shin, Dong-Gap; Park, Tae Hyun; Huh, June; Lee, Hyungsuk; Kim, Dae-Eun; Ryu, Du Yeol; Thomas, Edwin L; Koh, Won-Gun; Park, Cheolmin",Sci Adv,,217

244522,Global attitudes in the management of acute appendicitis during COVID-19 pandemic: ACIE Appy Study,2020,"RATIONALE: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is an immense global health threat that has invoked unheard-of containment measures in numerous countries to reduce the number of new infections. OBJECTIVE: The sequential introduction of severe measures, intentionally aiming at reducing the number of new infections, also imposes sharp restrictions on populations with potentially unintended, detrimental effects on public mental health. METHOD: We used observational data reflecting the number of phone calls made to national crisis hotlines in Austria and Germany during the COVID-19 pandemic (January 2020-April 2020) to investigate the impact of government restrictions as well as their later revocations on public mental health. Importantly, both countries have comparable health care systems, are similar in their political and socio-economic idiosyncrasies, and took similar restrictive government measures in order to contain COVID-19-but implemented them at different points in time. RESULTS: Analysis indicated that the number of crisis hotline calls increased in both countries. This increase seemed to occur at around the same time as the implementation of restrictive governmental responses. Importantly, the revocation of these governmental restrictions (i.e., re-opening the economy, allowing more social contact) seemed to occur at around the same time as the decrease in the number of calls. CONCLUSIONS: The present study supports the notion that the implementation of severe measures affects public mental health. However, the negative mental health effects of COVID-19 may be reduced if severe governmental restrictions are kept in place as briefly as possible.","Arendt, Florian; Markiewitz, Antonia; Mestas, Manina; Scherr, Sebastian",Soc Sci Med,,217

METHODS: Fity-five COVID-19 patients were admitted to the Fifth People's Hospital of Wuxi from January 23rd to March 31st, 2020 as the research object. The demographic characteristics of the cases and the methods of immunotherapy were analyzed, focusing on the immunized indicators, positivity of pathogens and clinical indicators of critically ill COVID-19 patient, and the effects of immunotherapy and stem cell transplantation were evaluated. RESULTS: Aged, male and people with comorbidities were the main risk factors in the development of severe and critical COVID-19. All of confirmed COVID-19 cases (n = 55) had been treated with interferon-&#945; (IFN-&#945;), of which 81.8% (n = 45, mild and ordinary) of the patients were recovered, 14.6% (n = 8) of the patients were converted to severe, 3.6% (n = 2) of the patients were converted to critical, and some severe patients were treated with gamma globulin and albumin as adjuvant treatment. Critically ill patients were not only treated with IFN-&#945;, gamma globulin and albumin, but also treated with convalescent plasma and MSC transplantation. Due to pulmonary hemorrhage and persistently low blood oxygen saturation, terminal lung transplantation therapy was implemented. The total number of lymphocytes, CD4+, CD8+ T lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells and B cells in peripheral blood of the two critical COVID-19 patients were significantly reduced, and the functions of lung, liver, and kidney were severely damaged on admission, manifested as significant increase of the levels of blood C-reactive protein (CRP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), etc. and decrease of blood oxygen saturation, and type I respiratory failure, and the noninvasive assisted ventilation was needed to improve. After adjuvant immunotherapy such as gamma globulin, the nucleic acid of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) turned into negative. The CRP of one critically ill patient was significantly lower than the value at admission (minimum of 21 mg/L). But the lung inflammation progressed rapidly, and the pathological results of the lung tissue from the lung transplantation showed hemorrhage and irreversible fibrosis. The ability to secrete immunoglobulin A (IgA) was significantly reduced. Liver function had been significantly improved and stabilized after treatment with convalescent plasma during the recovery period. MSC transplantation treatment reduced the BUN level by > 50% compared with the previous period, and the total number of lymphocytes in the patient increased by more than 2 times (rose from 0.23×109/L to 0.57×109/L), but the total amount of lymphocytes was still lower than the normal reference value (< 1.1×109/L). The lung inflammation lesions were obviously absorbed, and the vital signs were stable. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to IFN, gamma globulin, antiserum and MSC transplantation therapy can help clear the virus and reduce inflammation. Although MSC transplantation fail to completely change the immunecompromised state of critically ill patients, it controlled the progression of inflammation in the liver and kidneys.","Yan, Yan; Jiang, Xiufeng; Ding, Difei; Huang, Jiehui",Zhonghua Wei Zhong Bing Ji Jiu Yi Xue,,217

Dev. 145C (2020) pages 105043]",2021,"To limit the spread of the novel coronavirus, governments across the world implemented extraordinary physical distancing policies, such as stay-at-home orders. Numerous studies aim to estimate the effects of these policies. Many statistical and econometric methods, such as difference-in-differences, leverage repeated measurements, and variation in timing to estimate policy effects, including in the COVID-19 context. Although these methods are less common in epidemiology, epidemiologic researchers are well accustomed to handling similar complexities in studies of individual-level interventions. Target trial emulation emphasizes the need to carefully design a nonexperimental study in terms of inclusion and exclusion criteria, covariates, exposure definition, and outcome measurement-and the timing of those variables. We argue that policy evaluations using group-level longitudinal (""panel"") data need to take a similar careful approach to study design that we refer to as policy trial emulation. This approach is especially important when intervention timing varies across jurisdictions; the main idea is to construct target trials separately for each treatment cohort (states that implement the policy at the same time) and then aggregate. We present a stylized analysis of the impact of state-level stay-at-home orders on total coronavirus cases. We argue that estimates from panel methods-with the right data and careful modeling and diagnostics-can help add to our understanding of many policies, though doing so is often challenging.","Ben-Michael, Eli; Feller, Avi; Stuart, Elizabeth A",Epidemiology,,217

The present pandemic, declared on the 11 thof March 2020, was first recognized in Wuhan city, and rapidly spread throughout China and other countries, including Portugal. Regional anesthesia should be considered whenever surgery is planned for a patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, as it minimizes not only airway management, the intervention with the highest risk of aerosolization, but also potential personnel contamination and patient recovery time, while maximizing operation room efficiency. Anesthesia techniques should be aimed at preventing airway manipulation such as endotracheal intubation, which is associated with a higher risk of pulmonary complications in infected patients. These recommendations are structured in pre-, intra-, and post-operative management in suspected or confirmed infected patients with SARS-CoV-2, based in local hospital infection committee recommendations and the most recent literature available regarding regional anaesthesia. They are aimed at anesthesiology personnel, with the main goals being both team and patient safety. The SARS-CoV-2 virus will be not the last novel virus to trigger global pandemics, so having a well-structured regional anesthesia plan to manage this kind of cases will ensure the best outcome possible to both patients and the perioperative team.

A similar clinical profile occurs in severe trauma cases. This review compares pathophysiological and therapeutic principles of severely injured trauma patients and severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The development of sequential organ failure in trauma parallels deterioration seen in severe COVID-19. Based on established pathophysiological models in the field of trauma, two complementary pathways of disease progression into severe COVID-19 have been identified. Furthermore, the transition from local contained disease into systemic and remote inflammation has been addressed. More specifically, the traumatology concept of sequential insults ('hits') resulting in immune dysregulation, is applied to COVID-19 disease progression modelling. Finally, similarities in post-insult humoral and cellular immune responses to severe trauma and severe COVID-19 are described. To minimize additional 'hits' to COVID-19 patients, we suggest postponing all elective surgery in endemic areas. Based on traumatology experience, we propose that immunoprotective protocols including lung protective ventilation, optimal thrombosis prophylaxis, secondary infection prevention and calculated antibiotic therapy are likely also beneficial in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Finally, rising SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality rates mandate exploration of out-of-the box treatment concepts, including experimental therapies designed for trauma care.","Teuben, Michel P.

Research on synthetic drugs and vaccines has become a focus of attention in China and other countries, as such approaches are regarded as key tools for disease prevention and control; however, the development of these therapeutics will take months, or even years. Under such circumstances, development of coronavirus specific therapeutics is urgent. For this specific indication, the rapid performance of natural products, such as plant compounds, herbal extracts, and traditional Chinese medicine, could contribute as alternative measures. Recent investigations have provided evidence that these natural products are potential candidates for development as therapeutic agents against the virus that causes COVID-19, 2019-nCoV. Targeting the structural proteins or cellular receptors of 2019-nCoV, including coronavirus chymotrypsin-like (3CLproor Mpro), helicase (nsP13), S protein, and human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), holds promise for preventing infection. In this review, we summarize some representative natural products and their active components that have potential anti-2019-nCoV effects. We focus on the basic structural elements of 2019-nCoV, its main mechanisms of action, and the feasibility and potential of products to inhibit the novel coronavirus. In addition, the relative advantages, additional functions, and precautions that should be used with typical natural products are also discussed. The aim is to make the case that natural products could be a valuable pool for the development of active compounds for treating 2019-nCoV infection, which may contribute to mitigation of the spread of the pandemic.","Zhou, Jin; Huang, Jie",Front.

However, preserving the myoelectric control system's performance over multiple days is challenging, due to the transient nature of this recording technique. In practice, if the system is to remain usable, a time-consuming and periodic re-calibration is necessary. In the case where the sEMG interface is employed every few days, the user might need to do this re-calibration before every use. Thus, severely limiting the practicality of such a control method. Consequently, this paper proposes tackling the especially challenging task of adapting to sEMG signals when multiple days have elapsed between each recording, by presenting SCADANN, a new, deep learning-based, self-calibrating algorithm. SCADANN is ranked against three state of the art domain adversarial algorithms and a multiple-vote self-calibrating algorithm on both offline and online datasets.

While preexisting inequities have amplified the negative impacts of the pandemic, culturally sensitive crisis response is challenged by the diversity and intersecting identities of the nation’s second largest ethnic group. This article examines COVID-19 related inequities among the Latinx population through the lens of Representative Bureaucracy, and suggests that public administration can address COVID-19 inequities through the promotion of passive, active, and symbolic representation while taking into consideration the unique within-group diversity of the Latinx experience. We further suggest that leveraging social networks are one path forward and can demonstrate the particular importance of symbolic representation during crisis response.

Objectives: This study aimed to measure the awareness level of nurses in Shiraz, Iran, during the current COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: A self-administered questionnaire containing knowledge questions was distributed to 85 participants to complete. Results: More than half of the nurses (56.5%) had good knowledge about sources, transmission, symptoms, signs, prognosis, treatment, and mortality rate of COVID-19. The sources of information for the nurses were the World Health Organization and the Ministry of Health (55.29%), social applications (48.23%), and media (42.35%). Conclusions: Nurses had almost good knowledge of COVID-19. However, the WHO and the Ministry of Health still must provide more information for the medical staff for better control of the infectious disease.","Nemati, Marzieh; Ebrahimi, Bahareh; Nemati, Fatemeh",Arch.

Judicious implementation and relaxation of restrictions amplify their public health benefits while reducing costs. We derive optimal strategies for toggling between mitigation stages using daily COVID-19 hospital admissions. With public compliance, the policy triggers ensure adequate intensive care unit capacity with high probability while minimizing the duration of strict mitigation measures. In comparison, we show that other sensible COVID-19 staging policies, including France's ICU-based thresholds and a widely adopted indicator for reopening schools and businesses, require overly restrictive measures or trigger strict stages too late to avert catastrophic surges. As proof-of-concept, we describe the optimization and maintenance of the staged alert system that has guided COVID-19 policy in a large US city (Austin, Texas) since May 2020. As cities worldwide face future pandemic waves, our findings provide a robust strategy for tracking COVID-19 hospital admissions as an early indicator of hospital surges and enacting staged measures to ensure integrity of the health system, safety of the health workforce, and public confidence.","Yang, Haoxiang; Sürer, Özge; Duque, Daniel; Morton, David P; Singh, Bismark; Fox, Spencer J; Pasco, Remy; Pierce, Kelly; Rathouz, Paul; Valencia, Victoria; Du, Zhanwei; Pignone, Michael; Escott, Mark E; Adler, Stephen I; Johnston, S Claiborne; Meyers, Lauren Ancel",Nat Commun,,217
259254,"First, second and third wave of COVID-19. What have we changed in the ICU management of these patients?",2021,"Information and communication technologies (ICTs) have increasingly become vital for people on the move including the nearly 80 million displaced due to conflict, violence, and human right violations globally. However, existing research on ICTs and migrants, which almost entirely focused on migrants' ICT use 'en route' or within developed economies principally in the perspectives of researchers from these regions, is very fragmented posing a difficulty in understanding the key objects of research. Moreover, ICTs are often celebrated as liberating and exploitable at migrants' rational discretion even though they are 'double-edged swords' with significant risks, burdens, pressures and inequality challenges particularly for vulnerable migrants including those forcefully displaced and trafficked. Towards addressing these limitations and illuminating future directions, this paper, first, scrutinises the existing research vis-a-vis ICTs' liberating and authoritarian role particularly for vulnerable migrants whereby explicating key issues in the research domain. Second, it identifies key gaps and opportunities for future research. Using a tailored methodology, broad literature relating to ICTs and migration/development published in the period 1990-2020 was surveyed resulting in 157 selected publications which were critically appraised vis-a-vis the key themes, major technologies dealt with, and methodologies and theories/concepts adopted. Furthermore, key insights, trends, gaps, and future research opportunities pertaining to both the existing and missing objects of research in ICTs and migration/development are spotlighted.","Haile, Yidnekachew Redda",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.09782v1.pdf,217

Standard imaging features of KD include interstitial and lobular inflammatory lesions in the lungs, while KD shock syndrome (KDSS), complicated with substantial consolidation and atelectasis in the lung, is rarely reported. PATIENTS CONCERNS: Herein, we report a single case of a 5-year-old female patient who manifested KDSS on the seventh day of the course of KD. Chest enhanced computed tomography indicated large-area consolidation in the lower lobes of the bilateral lungs. DIAGNOSIS: The patient was diagnosed with KDSS complicated with non-infective lung consolidation. INTERVENTIONS: The patient received human intravenous immunoglobulin (2âg/kg) and aspirin (30-50âmg/kgd), methylprednisolone, a vasoactive agent, and albumin. Infective factors were excluded. OUTCOMES: The consolidation in the lower lobe of the bilateral lungs was completely recovered after 3 days of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Children with KDSS may present with pulmonary lesions such as substantial consolidation and atelectasis; thus, infective factors should be excluded. If there is no etiological evidence, antibiotics should be used with caution.","Song, Yue; Wei, Wuran; Liu, Lan; Wang, Yibing; Shi, Xiaoqing; Li, Li",Medicine (Baltimore),,217

260526,Prognosticating COVID-19: A need for Africa-specific laboratory predictors,2020,"A series of cases with rare thromboembolic incidents including cerebral sinus vein thrombosis (some of them fatal) and concomitant thrombocytopenia occurring shortly after vaccination with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine AZD1222 (Vaxzevria) have caused significant concern and led to its temporary suspension in many countries. Immediate laboratory efforts in four of these patients have identified a tentative pathomechanism underlying this syndrome termed initially vaccine-induced prothrombotic immune thrombocytopenia (VIPIT) and renamed recently vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT). It encompasses the presence of platelet-activating antibodies to platelet factor-4/heparin complexes, possibly emulated by polyanionic constituents of AZD1222, and thus resembles heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Because these immune complexes bind and activate platelets via FcÎ³ receptor IIA (FcÎ³RIIA), high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin G has been suggested for treatment of VITT in addition to non-heparin anticoagulants. Here we propose inhibitors of Bruton tyrosine kinase (Btk) approved for B cell malignancies (e.g., ibrutinib) as another therapeutic option in VITT, as they are expected to pleiotropically target multiple pathways downstream of FcÎ³RIIA-mediated Btk activation, for example, as demonstrated for the effective inhibition of platelet aggregation, dense granule secretion, P-selectin expression and platelet-neutrophil aggregate formation stimulated by FcÎ³RIIA cross-linking. Moreover, C-type lectin-like receptor CLEC-2- and GPIb-mediated platelet activation, the interactions and activation of monocytes and the release of neutrophil extracellular traps, as encountered in HIT, could be attenuated by Btk inhibitors. As a paradigm for emergency repurposing of approved drugs in COVID-19, off-label use of Btk inhibitors in a low-dose range not affecting haemostatic functions could thus be considered a sufficiently safe option to treat VITT.","von Hundelshausen, Philipp; Lorenz, Reinhard; Siess, Wolfgang; Weber, Christian",Thromb. haemost,,217

261971,[Psychiatric consequences of Covid-19 are in front of us…],2020,"To understand and approach the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, machine learning offers fundamental tools. This study presents the use of machine learning techniques for projecting COVID-19 infections and deaths in Mexico. The research has three main objectives: first, to identify which function adjusts the best to the infected population growth in Mexico; second, to determine the feature importance of climate and mobility; third, to compare the results of a traditional time series statistical model with a modern approach in machine learning. The motivation for this work is to support health care providers in their preparation and planning. The methods compared are linear, polynomial, and generalized logistic regression models to describe the growth of COVID-19 incidents in Mexico. Additionally, machine learning and time series techniques are used to identify feature importance and perform forecasting for daily cases and fatalities. The study uses the publicly available data sets from the John Hopkins University of Medicine in conjunction with the mobility rates obtained from Google's Mobility Reports and climate variables acquired from the Weather Online API. The results suggest that the logistic growth model fits best the pandemic's behavior, that there is enough correlation of climate and mobility variables with the disease numbers, and that the Long short-term memory network can be exploited for predicting daily cases. Given this, we propose a model to predict daily cases and fatalities for SARS-CoV-2 using time series data, mobility, and weather variables.","Gomez-Cravioto, Daniela A; Diaz-Ramos, Ramon E; Cantu-Ortiz, Francisco J; Ceballos, Hector G",Cognit Comput,,217

Structural comparison provides insights into protein function and evolution. Here, we review some of the original findings and thoughts that have led to the current established structure-based phylogeny of viruses: starting from the original observation that the major capsid proteins of plant and animal viruses possess similar folds, to the idea that each virus has an innate ""self"". This latter idea fueled the conceptualization of the PRD1-adenovirus lineage whose members possess a major capsid protein (innate ""self"") with a double jelly roll fold. Based on this approach, long-range viral evolutionary relationships can be detected allowing the virosphere to be classified in four structure-based lineages. However, this process is not without its challenges or limitations. As an example of these hurdles, we finally touch on the difficulty of establishing structural ""self"" traits for enveloped viruses showcasing the coronaviruses but also the power of structure-based analysis in the understanding of emerging viruses.","Ravantti, Janne J; Martinez-Castillo, Ane; Abrescia, Nicola G A",Viruses,,217

«либеральный» В статье также рассмотрены ключевые ценностные установки и социально-демографические характеристики групп с разными идейно-политическими предпочтениями В частности, делается вывод о постепенном транзите «советского» дискурса из сферы идейного противостояния в сферу морали, в идеализацию «советского человека», приписывания ему особых качеств, отсутствующих, по мнению большинства респондентов, у нынешнего поколения россиян В отношении ценностных ориентиров, которые должны быть основополагающими для России ХХI века, исследование показало востребованность проекта будущего, базирующегося на идеях справедливости и демократии, предполагающий не только улучшение материальных условий жизни, но и минимизацию разнообразных неравенств, расширение возможностей индивидуальной самореализации и политического участия Особенно чётко это проявляется в установках современной молодёжи В то же время, не менее реальной перспективой, особенно в контексте пандемии COVID-19, может стать новый всплеск авторитарных настроений, основой для которого выступят идеи величия державы, возврата к традиционным ценностям, «сильной руке», которые уже сейчас поддерживает значительная часть традиционалистски ориентированных и не имеющих чётко выраженных идейно-политических предпочтений респондентов","Petukhov, Vladimir V.",Sociologicheskaja nauka i social&#039;naia praktika,,217

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was designed as a descriptive, cross-sectional study. Serum melatonin levels and sleep parameters of children with the diagnosis of COVID-19 who had mild and moderate disease (i.e., COVID-19 group) were compared with those of children admitted with non-COVID-19 non-specific upper respiratory tract infection (i.e., control group). The Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children (SDSC) questionnaire was applied to the participants' primary caregivers to analyze their sleep patterns at present and six months before symptom onset and to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on sleep patterns. RESULTS: The entire study cohort consisted of 106 patients. The COVID-19 group included 80 patients, while the control group consisted of 26 patients. The mean serum melatonin levels were 136.72 pg/mL and 172.63 pg/mL in the COVID-19 and control groups, respectively (p=0.16). There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of 6 subcategories of the SDSC questionnaire regarding the present time and six months before symptom onset. The total SDSC scores were also similar in two different evaluation time points described above (p=0.99). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that COVID-19 did not impact the sleep parameters of children. Serum melatonin levels of all patients were higher than the reference range; however, they were higher in the non-COVID-19 patient group than the COVID-19 group. Since serum melatonin levels were higher than the reference values in children with COVID-19, and this disease is significantly less morbid in children, melatonin may have protective effects against COVID-19.","Yayici Köken, Özlem; Gültutan, Pembe; Güngören, Merve Sibel; Bayhan, Gülsüm Iclal; Yilmaz, Deniz; Gürkas, Esra; Özyürek, Hamit; Çitak Kurt, Aysegül Nese",Turkish journal of medical sciences,,217

METHODS: We performed a retrospective mixed-methods analysis of publicly available Twitter data derived from the publicly available ""Coronavirus Tweet IDs"" dataset, March 3, 2020-May 1, 2020. Original tweets and modified retweets in the dataset by 50 influential EM Twitter users in the US were analyzed using linguistic software to report the emotional tone and temporal viewpoint. We qualitatively analyzed a 25% random subsample and report themes. RESULTS: There were 1315 tweets available in the dataset from 36/50 influential EM Twitter users in the US. The majority of tweets were either positive (455/1315, 34.6%) or neutral (407/1315, 31%) in tone and focused on the present (1009/1315, 76.7%). Qualitative analysis identified six distinct themes, with users most often sharing news or clinical information. CONCLUSIONS: During the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic, influential EM Twitter users in the US delivered mainly positive or neutral messages, most often pertaining to news stories or information directly relating to patient care. The majority of these messages led to engagement by other users. This study underscores how EM influencers can leverage social media in public health outbreaks to bring attention to topics of importance.","Leibowitz, Maren K; Scudder, Michael R; McCabe, Meghan; Chan, Jennifer L; Klein, Matthew R; Trueger, N Seth; McCarthy, Danielle M",West J Emerg Med,,217

Leukopenia, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia were encountered more frequently in influenza patients than in COVID-19 patients (22.1% vs. 8.5%, p = 0.029; 17.6% vs. 5.6%, p = 0.013; and 13.2% vs. 5.6%, p = 0.048, respectively). Both groups showed significantly elevated monocyte levels in the complete blood count (70.4% vs. 69.9%, p = 0.511). Major chest X-ray findings in COVID-19 patients included mild diffuse ground glass opacity and right lower lobe infiltrates. There were no statistically significant intergroup differences in hospitalization or mortality rates; however, the intensive care unit admission rate was higher among COVID-19 patients (2.4% vs. 0.5%, p = 0.045). Conclusion: In this study, pediatric COVID-19 patients showed a wide range of clinical presentations ranging from asymptomatic/mild to severe illness. We found no intergroup differences in hospitalization rates, oxygen requirements, or hospital length of stay; however, the intensive care unit admission rate was higher among COVID-19 patients.","Siddiqui, Meraj; Gültekingil, Ayse; Bakirci, Oguz; Uslu, Nihal; Baskin, Esra",,,217
265442,A Long Way to Go Understanding the Role of Chaplaincy? A Critical Reflection on the Findings of the Survey Examining Chaplaincy Responses to Covid-19,2021,"In the face of the COVID-19 outbreak, military healthcare teams were deployed to London to assist the London Ambulance Service t transfer ventilated patients between medical facilities. This paper describes the preparation and activity of these military teams, records the lessons identified (LI) and reviews the complications encountered'. The teams each had two members. A consultant or registrar in emergency medicine (EM) and pre-hospitalemergency medicine (PHEM)E or anaesthesia and an emergency nurse or paramedic. Following a period of training, the teams undertook 52 transfers over a 14-day period. LI centred around minimising both interruption to ventilation and risk of aerosolisation of infectious particles and thus the risk of transmission of COVID-19 to the treating clinicians. Three patient-related complications (6% of all transfers) were identified. This was the first occasion on which the Defence Medical Services (DMS) were the main focus of a large-scale clinical military aid to the civil authorities. It demonstrated that DMS personnel have the flexibility to deliver a novel effect and the ability to seamlessly and rapidly integrate with a civilian organisation. It highlighted some clinical lessons that may be useful for future prehospital emergency care taskings where patients may have a transmissible respiratory pathogen. It also showed that clinicians from different backgrounds are able to safely undertake secondary transfer of ventilated patients. This approacmay enhance flexibility in future operational patient care pathways.","James, Robert Hywel; Doyle, C P; Cooper, D J",,,217
266233,Uninterrupted Anesthesia Support and Technique Adaptations for Patients Presenting for Electroconvulsive Therapy During the COVID-19 Era,2020,"Currently, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading rapidly around the world. This study aimed to investigate whether the presence of acute kidney injury (AKI) might increase the risk of severe infection and fatality in COVID-19 patients. We searched the PubMed, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, MedRxiv and COVID-19 academic research communication platforms for studies reporting severe infection rates and case-fatality rates in COVID-19 patients with and without AKI up to June 20, 2020. The main outcomes were the comparisons of the severe infection rates and fatality rates in COVID-19 patients with and without AKI and the estimation of the odds ratio (OR) and its 95 % confidence interval (CI) for severe infection and mortality. Statistical analyses were performed with R statistical software. A total of 40 studies involving 24,527 patients with COVID-19 were included in our meta-analysis. The incidence of AKI was 10 % (95 % CI 8%-13 %) in COVID-19 patients. The patients had higher severe infection and fatality rates (55.6 % vs. 17.7 % and 63.1 % vs. 12.9 %, respectively, all P < 0.01) with COVID-19. AKI was a predictor of fatality (OR = 14.63, 95 % CI: 9.94-21.51, P < 0.00001) and severe infection (OR = 8.11, 95 % CI: 5.01-13.13, P < 0.00001) in patients with COVID-19. Higher levels of serum creatinine (Scr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were associated with a significant increase in fatality [Scr: mean difference (MD): 20.19 µmol/L, 95 % CI: 14.96-25.42, P < 0.001; BUN: MD: 4.07 mmol/L, 95 % CI: 3.33-4.81, P < 0.001] and severe infection (Scr: MD: 7.78 µmol/L, 95 % CI: 4.43-11.14, P < 0.00001, BUN: MD: 2.12 mmol/L, 95 % CI: 1.74-2.50, P < 0.00001) in COVID-19 patients. In conclusion, AKI is associated with severe infection and higher fatality rates in patients with COVID-19. Clinicians should pay more attention to the monitoring and treatment of COVID-19 patients with AKI.","Shao, Mengjiao; Li, XiaoMei; Liu, Fen; Tian, Ting; Luo, Junyi; Yang, Yining",Pharmacol Res,,217

268689,[The fight against COVID-19 in Cameroon needs a second breath],2020,"The furin cleavage site plays an important role in virus pathogenicity. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 harbors a furin cleavage site insertion in contrast to SARS-CoV, which may be related to its stronger communicability. An avian coronavirus with an extra furin cleavage site upstream of the fusion peptide (S2' site) infected monocyte cells and neuron cells leading to viremia or encephalitis, respectively. Immunohistochemistry and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction were used to follow disease progression and demonstrated differences between the parent avian coronavirus and mutated avian coronavirus with a furin-S2' site. Magnetic resonance imaging and biological dye to evaluate the blood-brain barrier permeability showed that avian coronavirus with a furin-S2' site had increased permeability compared with parent avian coronavirus. Immunohistochemistry of brains after intracerebral injection of avian coronavirus and immunofluorescence staining of primary neuron cells demonstrated the furin-S2' site expanded the cell tropism of the mutant avian coronavirus to neuron cells. TNF-&#945;, which has a key role in blood-brain barrier permeability, was highly induced by avian coronavirus with a furin-S2' site compared with the parent avian coronavirus. We demonstrated the process involved in mutant avian coronavirus-induced disease and that the addition of a furin-S2' site changed the virus cell tropism.IMPORTANCECoronaviruses have broken out three times in two decades. Spike (S) protein plays a key role in the process of infection. To clarify importance of furin cleavage site in spike protein for coronavirus, we investigated the pathogenesis of neurotropic avian coronavirus whose spike protein contains an extra furin cleavage site (furin-S2' site). By combining real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry we demonstrated that infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) infects brain instead of trachea when its S protein contains furin-S2' site. Moreover, the virus was shown to increase the permeability of blood-brain barrier, infect neuron cells and induce high expression of TNF-&#945;. Based on these results we further show that furin cleavage site in S protein plays an important role in coronavirus pathogenicity and cell tropism. Our study extends previous publications on function of S protein of coronavirus, increasing the understanding of researchers to coronavirus.","Cheng, Jinlong; Zhao, Ye; Hu, Yanxin; Zhao, Jing; Xue, Jia; Zhang, Guozhong",J. virol,,217

268988,Gut microbiota: An intermediary between metabolic syndrome and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia,2020,"BACKGROUND: Life expectancy (LE) improvements have stalled, and UK tax and welfare 'reforms' have been proposed as a cause. We estimated the effects of tax and welfare reforms from 2010/2011 to 2021/2022 on LE and inequalities in LE in Scotland. METHODS: We applied a published estimate of the cumulative income impact of the reforms to the households within Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) quintiles. We estimated the impact on LE by applying a rate ratio for the impact of income on mortality rates (by age group, sex and SIMD quintile) and calculating the difference between inflation-only changes in benefits and the reforms. RESULTS: We estimated that changes to household income resulting from the reforms would result in an additional 1041 (+3.7%) female deaths and 1013 (+3.8%) male deaths. These deaths represent an estimated reduction of female LE from 81.6 years to 81.2 years (-20 weeks), and male LE from 77.6 years to 77.2 years (-23 weeks). Cuts to benefits and tax credits were modelled to have the most detrimental impact on LE, and these were estimated to be most severe in the most deprived areas. The modelled impact on inequalities in LE was widening of the gap between the most and least deprived 20% of areas by a further 21 weeks for females and 23 weeks for males. INTERPRETATION: This study provides further evidence that austerity, in the form of cuts to social security benefits, is likely to be an important cause of stalled LE across the UK.","Richardson, Elizabeth; Taulbut, Martin; Robinson, Mark; Pulford, Andrew; McCartney, Gerry",J. epidemiol. community health (1979),,217

At present, inadequate diagnosis and unreliable evaluation systems hinder the implementation and development of effective prevention and treatment strategies. Here, we conducted a horizontal and longitudinal study comparing the detection rates of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in different types of samples collected from COVID-19 patients and SARS-CoV-2-infected monkeys. We also detected anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the above clinical and animal model samples to identify a reliable approach for the accurate diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results showed that, regardless of clinical symptoms, the highest detection levels of viral nucleic acid were found in sputum and tracheal brush samples, resulting in a high and stable diagnosis rate. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin M (IgM) and G (IgG) antibodies were not detected in 6.90% of COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, integration of nucleic acid detection results from the various sample types did not improve the diagnosis rate. Moreover, dynamic changes in SARS-CoV-2 viral load were more obvious in sputum and tracheal brushes than in nasal and throat swabs. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection in sputum and tracheal brushes was the least affected by infection route, disease progression, and individual differences. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection using lower respiratory tract samples alone is reliable for COVID-19 diagnosis and study.","Tian, Ren-Rong; Yang, Cui-Xian; Zhang, Mi; Feng, Xiao-Li; Luo, Rong-Hua; Duan, Zi-Lei; Li, Jian-Jian; Liu, Jia-Fa; Yu, Dan-Dan; Xu, Ling; Zheng, Hong-Yi; Li, Ming-Hua; Fan, Hong-Li; Wang, Jia-Li; Dong, Xing-Qi; Zheng, Yong-Tang",Zool Res,,217

This invited review discusses ongoing developments and future research pathways for respiratory assist devices and tissue engineering to treat advanced and refractory lung disease. An overview is also given on the aftermath of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and lessons learned as the world comes out of this situation. The first order of business in the future of lung support is solving the problems with existing mechanical devices. Interestingly, challenges identified during the early days of development persist today. These challenges include device-related infection, bleeding, thrombosis, cost, and patient quality of life. The main approaches of the future directions are to repair, restore, replace, or regenerate the lungs. Engineering improvements to hollow fiber membrane gas exchangers are enabling longer term wearable systems and can be used to bridge lung failure patients to transplantation. Progress in the development of microchannel-based devices has provided the concept of biomimetic devices that may even enable intracorporeal implantation. Tissue engineering and cell-based technologies have provided the concept of bioartificial lungs with properties similar to the native organ. Recent progress in artificial lung technologies includes continued advances in both engineering and biology. The final goal is to achieve a truly implantable and durable artificial lung that is applicable to destination therapy.","Swol, Justyna; Shigemura, Norihisa; Ichiba, Shingo; Steinseifer, Ulrich; Anraku, Masaki; Lorusso, Roberto",Artif Organs,,217

Recent studies indicate that information seeking behavior is not necessarily a measure of enhanced individual preparedness. A qualitative change from “blindly” following directions to practicing emergency planning and becoming your own disaster risk manager is required. For pandemics, the challenge is even more complicated due to their unique characteristics. Community based exercises (CBEx), a framework concept encompassing a variety of interactive activities, have recently started being utilized to develop resilience amongst citizens. Existing models of resilience can pinpoint to the required knowledge, skills and attitude. Research in the factors influencing behavioral change could offer new understanding of the interplay between cognitive and demographic drivers/factors of resilience. Such knowledge could be utilized for setting targeted objectives, developing appropriate activities and the corresponding training for the CBEx facilitators.

278320,The Bidirectional Association Between Physical and Cognitive Function Among Chinese Older Adults: A Mediation Analysis,2020,"BACKGROUND: The severity of COVID-19 could be evaluated by examining several blood parameters mainly white blood cell (WBC) count, granulocytes, platelet, and novel hemocytometric markers neutrophils to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte (PLR), and lymphocyte to monocyte ratio (LMR). The current study was conducted to investigate alteration in blood parameters and their association with the severity and mortality of COVID-19 patients. METHODOLOGY: An observational cross-sectional study was conducted retrospectively, a total of 101 COVID-19 positive patients were examined: 52 were mild, 24 were moderate, 09 were severe, and 16 were critically diseased patients. We also recorded 16 deaths associated with the critical group. The overall mean age observed in our study was 48.94 years, where the mean age for critical individuals was 62.12 ± 14.35 years. RESULTS: A significant association between the disease severity and elevation in blood parameters were observed. The WBC's and granulocyte count were significantly increased (p value <0.001) while the mean platelet count (165.0 × 109 /L) and red blood cell volume distribution width (RDW) were decreased in the critical group (57.86%) compared to mild group's patients (177.3%) (p = 0.83). The lymphocytes count was decreased in critical patients (1.40 × 109 /L) compared to mild patients (1.92 × 109 /L) (p = 0.28). A significant association was observed in platelet-lymphocyte ratio (p < 0.001), Neutrophil-Lymphocyte ratio (p = <0.001), and Lymphocyte-Monocyte ratio (0.011). CONCLUSION: These blood parameters could be used as a suitable biomarker for the prognosis and severity of COVID-19. Evaluating novel hemograms NLR, PLR, and LMR can aid clinicians to identify potentially severe cases at early stages, initiate effective management in time, and conduct early triage which may reduce the overall mortality of COVID-19 patients.","Waris, Abdul; Din, Misbahud; Khalid, Atiqa; Abbas Lail, Raees; Shaheen, Asmat; Khan, Nida; Nawaz, Mehboob; Baset, Abdul; Ahmad, Imtiaz; Ali, Muhammad",J Clin Lab Anal,,217
278656,Operational considerations for peritoneal dialysis management during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"There is an urgent need for vaccines and antiviral drugs to combat the COVID-19 pandemic Encouraging progress has been made in developing antivirals targeting SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19 Among the drug targets being investigated, the viral main protease (M (pro) ) is one of the most extensively studied drug targets M (pro) is a cysteine protease that hydrolyzes the viral polyprotein at more than 11 sites and it is highly conserved among coronaviruses In addition, M (pro) has a unique substrate preference for glutamine in the P1 position Taken together, it appears that M (pro) inhibitors can achieve both broad-spectrum antiviral activity and a high selectivity index Structurally diverse compounds have been reported as M (pro) inhibitors, with several of which also showed antiviral activity in cell culture In this study, we investigated the mechanism of action of six previously reported M (pro) inhibitors, ebselen, disulfiram, tideglusib, carmofur, shikonin, and PX-12 using a consortium of techniques including FRET-based enzymatic assay, thermal shift assay, native mass spectrometry, cellular antiviral assays, and molecular dynamics simulations Collectively, the results showed that the inhibition of M (pro) by these six compounds is non-specific and the inhibition is abolished or greatly reduced with the addition of reducing reagent DTT In the absence of DTT, these six compounds not only inhibit M (pro) , but also a panel of viral cysteine proteases including SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease, the 2A (pro) and 3C (pro) from enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) and EV-D68 However, none of the compounds inhibits the viral replication of EV-A71 or EV-D68, suggesting that the enzymatic inhibition potency IC (50) values obtained in the absence of DTT cannot be used to faithfully predict their cellular antiviral activity Overall, we provide compelling evidence suggesting that ebselen, disulfiram, tideglusib, carmofur, shikonin, and PX-12 are non-specific SARS-CoV-2 M (pro) inhibitors, and urge the scientific community to be stringent with hit validation","Ma, C.; Hu, Y.; Townsend, J.

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, aside from its impact on physical health, has also had its effects on mental health. This study aimed to explore the frequency of new onset OCD symptomology in medical students amidst COVID-19 pandemic and its association with potential sociodemographic parameters.MethodThis cross-sectional study was conducted among medical students studying in Pakistani medical colleges. Data were collected after ethical approval from 1st January 2020 to 20th January 2020 during the second COVID-19 wave. Participants with a history of diagnosed psychiatric illness such as OCD, bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety and those taking relevant medications were excluded from the study. The online questionnaire included Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) and Revised Padua Inventory-Contamination Subscale (PI-CS), which were used to assess OCD symptoms and aversion for contamination respectively. Participants filled Y-BOCS twice, once for pre-pandemic score (based on self-recall), and a second time during 2nd wave of COVID-19. Data were analysed using IBM SPSS v23.0 (Armonk, N.Y., USA).ResultThe study included 711 participants (Males: 29.8%, Mean age: 21.59 ± 1.52 years) from over 46 medical colleges and over 44 cities of Pakistan. The mean pre-pandemic and mid-2nd wave Y-BOCS scores were 11.86 ± 6.02 and 15.61 ± 7.41 respectively. The mean PI-CS score was 17.27 ± 9.17. Twenty five percent (n = 176) of students developed new onset OCD symptomology during pandemic, while seventy percent (n = 497) suffered from worsened Y-BOCS score during pandemic. New onset OCD symptomology was associated with age less than 20 years (p = 0.02), higher PI-CS score (p = 0.001) and studying in preclinical years (p = 0.002). Worsening of YBOCS score had significant association with female gender (p = 0.02), attending pandemic related awareness seminar (p = 0.027), studying in preclinical years (p &lt; 0.001) and age less than 20 years (p &lt; 0.001). High Padua scorers (16 and above) showed significant association with increase in YBOCS score (p &lt; 0.000), age less than 20 years (p = 0.005), preclinical years (p = 0.001), frequency of engagements in pandemic related discussions (p = 0.001) and change in YBOCS score (p &lt; 0.001).ConclusionOur findings indicate that the prevalence of OCD symptomology increased during the COVID-19 pandemic as demonstrated by increased Y-BOCS scores.Femal medical students and students in preclinical years are more likely to suffer from psycological impact of COVID-19 pandemic and heightened concerns and fear for contamination.","Mazhar, Khadija Khaliq Fatima Daneyal Arshad",BJPsych Open,,217

Nevertheless, NPI efficacy varies enormously between and within countries, mainly because of population and behavioral heterogeneity. In this work, we adapted a multi-group SEIRA model to study the spreading dynamics of COVID-19 in Chile, representing geographically separated regions of the country by different groups. We use national mobilization statistics to estimate the connectivity between regions and data from governmental repositories to obtain COVID-19 spreading and death rates in each region. We then assessed the effectiveness of different NPIs by studying the temporal evolution of the reproduction number R t . Analyzing data-driven and model-based estimates of R t , we found a strong coupling of different regions, highlighting the necessity of organized and coordinated actions to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we evaluated different scenarios to forecast the evolution of COVID-19 in the most densely populated regions, finding that the early lifting of restriction probably will lead to novel outbreaks.","Freire-Flores, Danton; Llanovarced-Kawles, Nyna; Sanchez-Daza, Anamaria; Olivera-Nappa, Álvaro",Chaos Solitons Fractals,,217
279992,Three ways COVID-19 makes the Oncology Care First Model more attractive,2020,"This paper studies the feasibility of detecting the pneumonia due to the COVID-19 with microwave medical imaging. One challenge while formulating such a problem is to identify the disease in lungs whose dielectric permittivity is dynamically fluctuating with the respiration. In this paper, we utilize this feature by assuming that the permittivity of the disease has minor variation at microwave frequencies during the respiration, and thus the dielectric variance of the pixels at the diseased site over a number of consecutive images significantly differs from those of the other tissues in the thorax. Based on this assumption, we propose two approaches that make use of the a priori information (API) on the position of the heart and the symmetry of the thorax, respectively, to identify a diseased lung. Finally, these two approaches are numerically validated on a thorax phantom, and their performance is compared. © 2021 EurAAP.","Lin, X.; Gong, Z.; Ding, Y.; Chen, Y.; Valdes Sosa, P.

During the extended lockdowns caused by the pandemic, online communities are crucial for people to access information and share experiences. In particular, two""new""communities have emerged on Reddit: /r/China_flu and /r/Coronavirus. By studying activities and users in these two communities, we provide a characterization of people's responses to COVID-19 on Reddit. First, we find that user activity peaks around March 17, when the World Health Organization (WHO) announced COVID-19 as a pandemic. Shortly after that, the activity levels of both communities have been declining week by week. We further illustrate the central role of these two communities in the emergence of COVID-related communities. Second, we study the differences between these two communities. /r/Coronavirus is recommended as the official community for COVID-19 on Reddit, while /r/China_flu adopts a loose moderation practice. As a result, we observe that these two communities are gradually growing apart and more extremism is being found in /r/China_flu. Finally, we examine the spillover effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on user activity across the entire Reddit platform. Our results show significant changes in user activities outside COVID-related communities. In subreddits related to finance, food, and countries/cities, user activity is recovering to the pre-pandemic level in late April and May as countries reopen, but subreddits related to travel and sports remain highly impacted and show lower activity levels than the pre-pandemic period. Our work highlights the strength of Reddit as a source for understanding public reactions to COVID-19 and the importance of content moderation on the Internet during a pandemic.","Zhang, Jason Shuo; Keegan, Brian C.; Lv, Qin; Tan, Chenhao",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.04816v1.pdf,217

281327,Close to Home,2020,"BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused unprecedented challenges within medical centers, revealing inequities embedded in the medical community and exposing fragile social support systems. While faculty and staff faced extraordinary demands in workplace duties, personal responsibilities also increased. The goal of this study was to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on personal and professional activities of faculty and staff in order to illuminate current challenges and explore solutions. METHODS: Qualitative, semi-structured group interviews involved faculty and staff at four affiliate sites within the Department of Medicine at the University of Colorado, School of Medicine. Focus groups addressed the impact of COVID-19 on (1) Changes to roles and responsibilities at work and at home, (2) Resources utilized to manage these changes and, (3) Potential strategies for how the Department could assist faculty and staff. Thematic analysis was conducted using an inductive method at the semantic level to form themes and subthemes. RESULTS: Qualitative analysis of focus group transcripts revealed themes of: (1) Challenges and disparities experienced during the pandemic, (2) Disproportionate impact on women personally and professionally, (3) Institutional factors that contributed to wellness and burnout, and (4) Solutions and strategies to support faculty and staff. Within each of these themes were multiple subthemes including increased professional and personal demands, concern for personal safety, a sense of internal guilt, financial uncertainty, missed professional opportunities, and a negative impact on mentoring. Solutions were offered and included an emphasis on addressing preexisting inequities, the importance of community, and workplace flexibility. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic created burdens for already challenged faculty and staff in both their personal and professional lives. Swift action and advocacy by academic institutions is needed to support the lives and careers of our colleagues now and in the future.","Gottenborg, Emily; Yu, Amy; Naderi, Roxana; Keniston, Angela; McBeth, Lauren; Morrison, Katherine; Schwartz, David; Burden, Marisha",BMC Health Serv Res,,217

282200,The Virtual Shoulder and Knee Physical Examination,2020,"Scientists from all over the world have been intensively working to discover different aspects of Coronavi-rus disease 2019 (COVID-19) since the first cluster of cases was reported in China. Herein, we aimed to investigate unclear issues related to transmission and pathogenesis of disease as well as accuracy of diagnostic tests and treatment modalities. A literature search on PubMed, Ovid, and EMBASE databases was con-ducted, and articles pertinent to identified search terms were extracted. A snow-ball search strategy was followed in order to retrieve additional relevant articles. It was reported that viral spread may occur during the asymptomatic phase of infection, and viral load was suggested to be a useful marker to assess disease severity. In contrast to immune response against viral infections, cytotoxic T lymphocytes decline in SARS-CoV-2 infection, which can be partially explained by direct invasion of T lymphocytes or apoptosis activated by SARS-CoV-2. Dysregulation of the urokinase pathway, cleavage of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein by FXa and FIIa, and consumption coagulopathy were the proposed mechanisms of the coagulation dysfunction in COVID-19. False-negative rates of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction varied between 3% and 41% across studies. The probability of the positive test was proposed to decrease with the number of days past from symptom onset. Safety issues related to infection spread limit the use of high flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in hypoxic patients. Further studies are required to elucidate the challenging issues, thus enhancing the management of COVID-19 patients.","Yuksel, Aycan; Karadogan, Dilek; Gurkan, Canan Gunduz; Akyil, Fatma Tokgoz; Toreyin, Zehra Nur; Marim, Feride; Arikan, Huseyin; Eyuboglu, Tugba Sismanlar; Emiralioglu, Nagehan; Serifoglu, Irem; Develi, Elif; Celik, Selman; Sertcelik, Umran Ozden; Gursoy, Tugba Ramasli; Elversli, Mehmet Fatih; Oncel, Asli; Er, Berrin; Firincioglulari, Ali; Gunaydin, Fatma Esra; Ozakinci, Hilal; Ozcelik, Neslihan; Esendagli, Dorina; Aydin, Asena; Kose, Neslihan; Ercelik, Merve; Gulhan, Pinar Yildiz; Yildiz, Ethem; Irmak, Ilim; Kara, Bilge Yilmaz; Gurz, Selcuk; Karakas, Fatma Gulsum; Akgun, Metin",Eurasian J.

The new high-performance module allows for an efficient use of single- and multiple-GPU architectures ranging from research laboratories to modern supercomputer centers. After detailing an analysis of our general scalable strategy that relies on OpenACC and CUDA, we discuss the various capabilities of the package. Among them, the multiprecision possibilities of the code are discussed. If an efficient double precision implementation is provided to preserve the possibility of fast reference computations, we show that a lower precision arithmetic is preferred providing a similar accuracy for molecular dynamics while exhibiting superior performances. As Tinker-HP is mainly dedicated to accelerate simulations using new generation point dipole polarizable force field, we focus our study on the implementation of the AMOEBA model. Testing various NVIDIA platforms including 2080Ti, 3090, V100, and A100 cards, we provide illustrative benchmarks of the code for single- and multicards simulations on large biosystems encompassing up to millions of atoms. The new code strongly reduces time to solution and offers the best performances to date obtained using the AMOEBA polarizable force field.

Objective: To describe the local spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Valencia, Spain. Design, Setting, and Participants: This single-center epidemiological cohort study of patients with SARS-CoV-2 was performed at University General Hospital in Valencia (population in the hospital catchment area, 364â¯000), a tertiary hospital. The study included all consecutive patients with COVID-19 isolated at home from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic on February 19 until August 31, 2020. Exposures: Cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by the presence of IgM antibodies or a positive polymerase chain reaction test result on a nasopharyngeal swab were included. Cases in which patients with negative laboratory results met diagnostic and clinical criteria were also included. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the characterization of dissemination patterns and connections among the 20 neighborhoods of Valencia during the outbreak. To recreate the transmission network, the inbound and outbound connections were studied for each region, and the relative risk of infection was estimated. Results: In total, 2646 patients were included in the analysis. The mean (SD) age was 45.3 (22.5) years; 1203 (46%) were male and 1442 (54%) were female (data were missing for 1); and the overall mortality was 3.7%. The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 cases was higher in neighborhoods with higher household income (ß2 [for mean income per household] = 0.197; 95% CI, 0.057-0.351) and greater population density (ß1 [inhabitants per km2] = 0.228; 95% CI, 0.085-0.387). Correlations with meteorological variables were not statistically significant. Neighborhood 3, where the hospital and testing facility were located, had the most outbound connections (14). A large residential complex close to the city (neighborhood 20) had the fewest connections (0 outbound and 2 inbound). Five geographically unconnected neighborhoods were of strategic importance in disrupting the transmission network. Conclusions and Relevance: This study of local dissemination of SARS-COV-2 revealed nonevident transmission patterns between geographically unconnected areas. The results suggest that tailor-made containment measures could reduce transmission and that hospitals, including testing facilities, play a crucial role in disease transmission. Consequently, the local dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 spread might inform the strategic lockdown of specific neighborhoods to stop the contagion and avoid a citywide lockdown.","Romero García, Carolina; Iftimi, Adina; Briz-Redón, Álvaro; Zanin, Massimiliano; Otero, Maria; Ballester, Mayte; de Andrés, José; Landoni, Giovanni; de Las Marinas, Dolores; Catalá Bauset, Juan Carlos; Mandingorra, Jesus; Conca, José; Correcher, Juan; Ferrer, Carolina; Lozano, Manuel",JAMA Netw Open,,217

While several abdominal emergencies can be managed effectively and safely using minimally invasive surgery (MIS), the safety of using MIS amid the COVID-19 pandemic has been debated. MIS, including laparoscopy and robotic surgery, is considered an aerosol-generating procedure and some recent research demonstrated possible spread of the virus through aerosol. This review assessed the available evidence on the safety of MIS in the COVID-19 era, explored the possible precautions to be taken when using MIS to prevent exposure of the operating team to infection, and highlighted the recommendations of several surgical societies in this regard. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Electronic databases, Google Scholar, and pre-print archives were searched for evidence on airborne transmission of COVID-19 and the safety of MIS amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Recommendations of recognized surgical societies were also searched. The available evidence was summarized in a narrative manner. RESULTS: Limited data on the possibility of airborne transmission of COVID-19 were found. The studies that reported on the presence of the SARS-COV-2 in the air samples of patients with COVID-19 had conflicting results. Several precautions to minimize the presumed risk of exposure of the operation room staff to COVID-19 were devised. CONCLUSION: According to the available evidence and recommendations of different surgical societies, MIS may be used in the treatment of acute abdominal emergency. However, considerable caution should be taken to avoid the presumed risk of aerosolization of the virus particles during the procedure, which may expose the operating staff to the risk of COVID-19.","Emile, Sameh Hany; Hamid, Hytham K S",Minim Invasive Ther Allied Technol,,217

Rapid responses by health systems to meet increased demand for hospital beds while continuing to provide health services, largely via a shift to telehealth services, are critical adaptations. However, these actions are not sufficient to mitigate the impact of coronavirus for people from marginalized communities, particularly those with behavioral health conditions, who are experiencing disproportional health, economic, and social impacts from the evolving pandemic. Helping these communities weather this storm requires partnering with existing community-based organizations and local governments to rapidly and flexibly meet the needs of vulnerable populations.","Progovac, Ana M; Cortés, Dharma E; Chambers, Valeria; Adams, Leslie B; Jean-Claude, Soso; Willison, Charley E; Flores, Michael; Creedon, Timothy B; Cook, Benjamin L",,,217

We aimed to assess psychological distress in the general population of Tunisia during the COVID-19 pandemic and to examine the contribution of religious coping (RC) in the reports of anxiety and depression at the time of the survey. We carried out and online cross-sectional study using a non-probability snowball sampling technique. A total of 603 responses were recorded. The ""Depression Anxiety Stress Scales,"" the ""Brief religious coping scale"" and the ""Arabic religiosity scale"" were used. We found that 28.3%, 24.4% and 19.4% of the participants reported severe or extremely severe levels of depression, anxiety and stress, respectively. The mean score for positive RC was 22.8 ± 5.3, while that for negative RC was 14 ± 5.8. After controlling for confounders, multivariate analysis showed that negative RC significantly and positively contributed to depression and anxiety scores in our respondents, indicating that greater use of negative RC was associated with higher levels of psychological distress. No significant relationship was found between overall religiosity or positive religious coping and either depression or anxiety symptoms. Religious beliefs may have an impact on how people cope with emerging infectious disease outbreaks. Religion should be considered by professionals as an important variable to consider in therapy for individuals who engage in RC or perceive religious needs.","Fekih-Romdhane, Feten; Cheour, Majda",J Relig Health,,217

289864,Lactation Care of Families in the Community Health Setting During the COVID Pandemic,2020,"Once integrated into clinical care, patient risk stratification models may perform worse compared to their retrospective performance. To date, it is widely accepted that performance will degrade over time due to changes in care processes and patient populations. However, the extent to which this occurs is poorly understood, in part because few researchers report prospective validation performance. In this study, we compare the 2020-2021 ('20-'21) prospective performance of a patient risk stratification model for predicting healthcare-associated infections to a 2019-2020 ('19-'20) retrospective validation of the same model. We define the difference in retrospective and prospective performance as the performance gap. We estimate how i)""temporal shift"", i.e., changes in clinical workflows and patient populations, and ii)""infrastructure shift"", i.e., changes in access, extraction and transformation of data, both contribute to the performance gap. Applied prospectively to 26,864 hospital encounters during a twelve-month period from July 2020 to June 2021, the model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.767 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.737, 0.801) and a Brier score of 0.189 (95% CI: 0.186, 0.191). Prospective performance decreased slightly compared to '19-'20 retrospective performance, in which the model achieved an AUROC of 0.778 (95% CI: 0.744, 0.815) and a Brier score of 0.163 (95% CI: 0.161, 0.165). The resulting performance gap was primarily due to infrastructure shift and not temporal shift. So long as we continue to develop and validate models using data stored in large research data warehouses, we must consider differences in how and when data are accessed, measure how these differences may affect prospective performance, and work to mitigate those differences.","Otlecs, Erkin; Oh, Jeeheh; Li, Benjamin; Bochinski, Michelle; Joo, Hyeon; Ortwine, Justin; Shenoy, Erica; Washer, Laraine; Young, Vincent B.; Rao, Krishna; Wiens, Jenna",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.13964v1.pdf,217

Although the reference diagnostic test is a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), chest-computed tomography (CT) has been frequently used in diagnosis because of the low sensitivity rates of RT-PCR. CT findings of COVID-19 are well described in the literature and include predominantly peripheral, bilateral ground-glass opacities (GGOs), combination of GGOs with consolidations, and/or septal thickening creating a ""crazy-paving"" pattern. Longitudinal changes of typical CT findings and less reported findings (air bronchograms, CT halo sign, and reverse halo sign) may mimic a wide range of lung pathologies radiologically. Moreover, accompanying and underlying lung abnormalities may interfere with the CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia. The diseases that COVID-19 pneumonia may mimic can be broadly classified as infectious or non-infectious diseases (pulmonary edema, hemorrhage, neoplasms, organizing pneumonia, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, sarcoidosis, pulmonary infarction, interstitial lung diseases, and aspiration pneumonia). We summarize the imaging findings of COVID-19 and the aforementioned lung pathologies that COVID-19 pneumonia may mimic. We also discuss the features that may aid in the differential diagnosis, as the disease continues to spread and will be one of our main differential diagnoses some time more.","Duzgun, Selin Ardali; Durhan, Gamze; Demirkazik, Figen Basaran; Akpinar, Meltem Gulsun; Ariyurek, Orhan Macit",Insights Imaging,,217

The present commentary focuses on highlighting some of the lessons learnt, challenges and future needs of the health workforce in Europe in the context of COVID-19. During the pandemic innovative and flexible approaches were implemented to meet increasing demand for health workers and new skills and responsibilities were adopted over a short period of time. We have seen the rapid adaptation and use of new technologies to deliver care. The pandemic has underlined the importance of valuing, protecting and caring for our health workforce and the need to invest appropriately and adequately in the health workforce to have sufficient, capable and well-motivated health workers. Some of the main challenges that lie ahead of us include the imperative for better investment, to need to improve recruitment and retraining whilst better retaining health workers, a focus on domestic sustainability, redeploying and developing new skills and competences among health workers, enabling more effective multi-professional collaboration and team work, improving the quality of education and training, increasing the public health focus and promoting ethical and sustainable international recruitment of health workers.

METHODS: A literature search was carried out in the guideline databases, Medline and Embase and in Diabetes Societies websites until May 21st, 2020 for guidelines and recommendations on type 1 diabetes mellitus management during COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: COVID-19 infection in pediatric patients seems to be clinically less severe than in adults; children have so far accounted for 1-5% of diagnosed cases, with a median age of 6.7 years (1 day-15 years) and better prognosis. Clinical manifestations include mild, moderate, severe disease up to critical illness. There is currently no evidence suggesting a higher risk of COVID-19 infection in children with diabetes than unaffected peers. Besides general recommendations for pediatric patients, ISPED has proposed specific measures for patients with diabetes. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 outbreak modified type 1 diabetes management, and telemedicine has been demonstrating to be an effective new tool for patients care. Moreover psychological aspects deserve attention and future researchs are mandatory.","d039,; Annunzio, Giuseppe; Maffeis, Claudio; Cherubini, Valentino; Rabbone, Ivana; Scaramuzza, Andrea; Schiaffini, Riccardo; Minuto, Nicola; Piccolo, Gianluca; Maghnie, Mohamad",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,,217

Our aim was to describe and compare ultrasound and Doppler findings from pregnant women either SARS-CoV-2 positive or negative evaluated during the pandemic period. METHODS: One hundred and six (106) pregnant women who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at the time or within one week of the ultrasound (US) scan were evaluated. There were 49 symptomatic and 57 asymptomatic women. US scans were performed either for routine fetal evaluation, or indicated due to a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. For comparison, 103 pregnant women (controls) matched for maternal age, parity, body mass index, and gestational age at the time of the US scan were evaluated. Control women did not refer symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection at the time of the US scan, or when admitted for delivery, and had a negative SARS-CoV-2 test at the time of admission for delivery. Fetal biometry, fetal anatomy, amount of amniotic fluid, Doppler parameters including umbilical and middle cerebral arteries pulsatility indices, cerebro-placental ratio, and biophysical profile (BBP) were evaluated when indicated. All biometry and Doppler values were converted to z-scores for comparisons. Our primary outcome, an adverse prenatal composite outcome (APCPO) included: small for gestational age (SGA) fetus, oligohydramnios, abnormal BPP, abnormal Doppler velocimetry, and fetal death. Comorbidities, delivery information, and neonatal outcomes were registered and compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Of women SARS-CoV-2 positive, 82.1% had a BMI >25.0 and had a higher prevalence of diabetes (26/106 [24.5%] vs. 13/103[12.6%]; p=0.03), but not of preeclampsia (21/106 [19.8%] vs. 11/105 [10.4%]; p=0.08) as compared to controls. The prevalence of APCPO was not significantly different between SARS-CoV-2 positive women (19/106 [17.9%]) and controls (9/103 [8.7%]; p=0.06. No differences in the prevalence of SGA fetuses (12/106 [11.3%] vs. 6/103 [5.8%]; p=0.17), fetuses with abnormal Doppler evaluation (8/106 [7.5%] vs. 2/103 [1.9%]; p=0.08), and with abnormal BPP (4/106 [3.7%] vs. 0/103 [0%] between SARS-CoV-2 positive woman and controls were documented. Two fetal deaths and a higher rate of preterm delivery &#8804; 35 weeks of gestation (22/106 vs. 9/103; OR, 2.37 [1.14-4.91] p=0.01) were observed in women SARS-CoV-2 positive as compared to controls.

Various factors govern the resulting dynamical behaviour of such networks, including the number of oscillators and their coupling schemes. Although these factors are seldom significant in large populations, a small change in them can drastically affect the global behaviour in small populations. In this paper, we perform an experimental investigation on the effect of these factors on the coupled behaviour of a minimal network of candle-flame oscillators. We observe that strongly coupled oscillators exhibit the global behaviour of in-phase synchrony and amplitude death, irrespective of the number and the topology of oscillators. However, when they are weakly coupled, their global behaviour exhibits the intermittent occurrence of multiple stable states in time. In addition to states of clustering, chimera, and weak chimera, we report the experimental discovery of partial amplitude death in a network of candle-flame oscillators. We also show that closed-loop networks tend to hold global synchronization for longer duration as compared to open-loop networks. We believe that our results would find application in real-life problems such as power grids, neuronal networks, and seizure dynamics.","Manoj, Krishna; Pawar, Samadhan A.; Sujith, R.

ResultsThe delta variant (B.1.617.2) was identified in the majority of cases. Despite similar Ct-values, we demonstrate lower probability of infectious virus detection in respiratory samples of vaccinated HCWs with breakthrough infections compared to unvaccinated HCWs with primary SARS-CoV-2 infections. Nevertheless, infectious virus was found in 68.6% of breakthrough infections and Ct-values decreased throughout the first 3 days of illness.

299840,"COVID-19 knowledge, risk perception, and information sources among Chinese population",2021,"BACKGROUND: The global outbreak of COVID-19 incepted in Wuhan, China in the late 2019. It is still unclear about the origin of the infection. Over time, it has migrated geographically to 150 countries in the world and World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the infectious disease to be pandemic. OBJECTIVE: Recently, COVID-19 has stepped into India by the travellers from other countries. The transmissibility and epidemicity of COVID-19 in India is exponential. So, in-order to understand the above characteristics, specifically COVID-19 status in India is analyzed. To analyze this into deeper, the state of Kerala is selected. The epidemiological characteristics of patients in Kerala, South India and the possible transmission of COVID-19 from asymptomatic members to other peers are shown using certain cases. METHODS: The COVID-19 dataset is taken from Kaggle dataset. This dataset contains the details of the infected patients from different states of India. Statistical analysis techniques where used to analyze the distribution of the affected cases in a particular state. RESULTS: The analysis shows that there is possibility of transmission of the infection even during incubation period. The recent trend in the number of infected cases in India is discussed. CONCLUSION: The transmissibility of COVID-19 and its epidemicity in India is discussed. In specific, a case study on COVID -19 cases in the state of Kerala relating the transmissibility is also summarized. Further, data related to patents on corona virus is also discussed. From the analysis, it can be concluded that there is a possibility of COVID-19 transmission even during incubation period.

301645,Fracture management during COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review,2020,"SESSION TITLE: Lessons from the ICU: What have We Learned about the Management of COVID-19 SESSION TYPE: Original Investigations PRESENTED ON: October 18-21, 2020 PURPOSE: Benefits of early tracheostomy (2-10 days after intubation) include decreased sedation, days on ventilator, ICU length of stay and long-term mortality In addition, it helps improve patient’s comfort level, tracheal suctioning, oral hygiene and facilitates early mobility in comparison to delayed tracheostomy (7-14 days after intubation) With the recent COVID-19 pandemic, an unprecedented surge in patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation led to an increase in the need for tracheostomies Tracheostomy is an aerosol-generating procedure that raises potential risk to the proceduralists Therefore, international professional otolaryngology and surgical organizations published guidelines, which recommended delaying tracheostomy to after 21 intubation days in order to ensure viral clearance prior to the procedure In the setting of these well-intended practice guidelines, intensivists are faced with a new dilemma;following the standard of care for tracheostomy planning vs delaying the procedure without evidence to support the new recommended guidelines METHODS: We utilized our previously established Institute for Critical Care Medicine Tracheostomy Team (ICCM-TT), with its multidisciplinary departments, which include Critical Care, General Surgery, Cardiac and Thoracic Surgery and Otolaryngology In April 2020, throughout the nine ICUs dedicated to the management of COVID-19 patients, the ICCM-TT performed 111 tracheostomy procedures Case selection involved a multidisciplinary team evaluation of patient’s clinical status and wishes after goals of care discussion Median time from translaryngeal intubation to tracheostomy was 11 days All cases were performed at bedside, using percutaneous dilatational technique with bronchoscopic guidance Additionally, real-time ultrasound guidance was utilized in cases identified to have difficult anatomical landmarks All of the 111 procedures were performed within 1 day of the tracheostomy request, unless medical instability deferred the procedure or revisiting goals of care was needed RESULTS: Of the patients who received tracheostomy for COVID-19 prolonged respiratory failure: 35 (31 5 %) patients discharged home alive, 23 (20 7 %) weaned from mechanical ventilation (no ventilator support, downsized or decannulated) but remain hospitalized on non-ICU floors, 33 (29 7 %) expired and the remaining 20 (18 %) are either in the ICUs or undergoing active weaning in a designated weaning unit Of note, none of the ICCM-TT proceduralists acquired COVID-19 infection, all have been tested negative for antibodies This may be due to the thorough pre-procedural planning, adherence to ICCM-TT protocols and vigilance in maintaining infection control guidelines CONCLUSIONS: Developing a dedicated tracheostomy team and following standard of care in timing of tracheostomy for COVID-19 patients avoided unnecessary delay of patient’s care without risk of viral transmission to the staff This facilitated patient’s ventilator weaning and discharges, which improved ICU throughput CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Our results support creating a dedicated tracheostomy team and following standard of care without the need to delay a necessary procedure for COVID-19 pneumonia patients Furthermore, this deemed safe when infection control protocols were strictly followed DISCLOSURES: No relevant relationships by Adel Bassily-Marcus, source=Web Response No relevant relationships by Ella Illuzzi, source=Web Response No relevant relationships by Roopa Kohli-Seth, source=Web Response No relevant relationships by Evan Leibner, source=Web Response No relevant relationships by Ahmed Mohammed, source=Web Response","Illuzzi, E.; Bassily-Marcus, A.; Kohli-Seth, R.; Leibner, E.; Mohammed, A.",Chest,,217

Antibody testing was performed on residual blood specimens for 112,941 individuals (â¼10% of Qatar's urban population) attending for routine/other clinical care between May 12-September 9, 2020. Seropositivity was 13.3% (95% CI=13.1-13.6%) and was independently associated with sex, age, nationality, clinical-care encounter type, and testing date. Median optical density (antibody titer) among antibody-positive persons was 27.0 (range=1.0-150.0), with higher values associated with age, nationality, clinical-care encounter type, and testing date. Seropositivity by nationality was positively-correlated with the likelihood of having higher antibody titers (Pearson correlation coefficient=0.85; 95% CI=0.47-0.96). Less than two in every 10 individuals in Qatar's urban population had detectable antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, suggesting this population is still far from herd immunity and at risk of subsequent infection waves. Higher antibody titer appears to be a biomarker of repeated exposures to the infection.","Coyle, Peter V; Chemaitelly, Hiam; Kacem, Mohamed Ali Ben Hadj; Al Molawi, Naema Hassan Abdulla; El Kahlout, Reham Awni; Gilliani, Imtiaz; Younes, Nourah; Al Anssari, Ghada Ali A A; Al Kanaani, Zaina; Al Khal, Abdullatif; Al Kuwari, Einas; Butt, Adeel A; Jeremijenko, Andrew; Kaleeckal, Anvar Hassan; Latif, Ali Nizar; Shaik, Riyazuddin Mohammad; Abdul Rahim, Hanan F; Nasrallah, Gheyath K; Yassine, Hadi M; Al Kuwari, Mohamed Ghaith; Al Romaihi, Hamad Eid; Al-Thani, Mohamed H; Bertollini, Roberto; Abu-Raddad, Laith J",iScience,,217
306016,"Neurosurgery Services in Dr. Sardjito General Hospital, Yogyakarta, Indonesia, During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Experience from a Developing Country",2020,"BACKGROUND: We have previously identified IL-9 producing mucosal mast cell (MMC9) as the primary source of IL-9 to drive intestinal mastocytosis and experimental IgE-mediated food allergy. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate the expansion of MMC9s remain unknown. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that IL-4 regulates MMC9 development and MMC9-dependent experimental IgE-mediated food allergy. METHODS: We utilized an epicutaneous sensitization-model and performed bone marrow (BM) reconstitution experiments, to test the requirement of IL-4R&#945; signaling on MMC9's in experimental IgE-mediated food allergy. Flow cytometric, bulk and single cell RNA-seq analysis on small intestine (SI)-MMC9s was performed to illuminate MMC9 transcriptional signature and the effect of IL-4R&#945; signaling on MMC9 function. BM-derived MMC9 culture system was used to define IL-4-BATF signaling in MMC9 development. RESULTS: Epicutaneous sensitization and BM reconstitution based models of IgE-mediated food allergy revealed an IL-4 signaling-dependent cell-intrinsic effect on SI- MMC9 cell accumulation and food allergy severity. RNA-seq analysis of SI-MMC9 cells identified 410 gene transcripts reciprocally regulated by IL-4 signaling, including Il9 and Basic leucine zipper ATF-like transcription factor (Batf). In silico analyses identified a 3491-gene MMC9 transcriptional signature and identified two transcriptionally distinct SI-MMC9 populations enriched for metabolic or inflammatory programs. Employing an in vitro MMC9-culture model system we show that generation of MMC9-like cells was induced by IL-4 and this was in part dependent on BATF. CONCLUSION: IL-4R&#945; signaling directly modulates MMC9 function and exacerbation of experimental IgE-mediated food allergic reactions. IL-4R&#945; regulation of MMC9s is in part BATF-dependent and via modulation of metabolic transcriptional programs.","Tomar, Sunil; Ganesan, Varsha; Sharma, Ankit; Zeng, Chang; Waggoner, Lisa; Smith, Andrew; Kim, Chang H; Licona-Limón, Paula; Reinhardt, Richard L; Flavell, Richard A; Wang, Yui-Hsi; Hogan, Simon P",J. allergy clin. immunol,,217
306825,Strategy for treating vascular emergencies during the COVID-19 pandemic in China,2020,"PURPOSE: Online health information (OHI) and social media have become prominent health resources for people with arthritis-related fatigue. More research is needed to understand how OHI and online social support may influence illness experiences and patient-practitioner relationships in people with arthritis-related fatigue. The present study aimed to explore how OHI and social media shape these experiences by using an inductive qualitative analysis. METHOD: Seven focus groups were conducted with 21 participants aged 28-77 diagnosed with a range of rheumatic diseases. Within the focus groups, participants were asked questions about OHI, online social support and the role of OHI in their health care. The focus groups were recorded, transcribed and analysed using a combination of interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) and thematic analysis. RESULTS: The analysis resulted in three themes: (a) how online social support changes illness experiences, (b) communicating fatigue to health professionals using OHI and (c) health care experiences online. These themes provide insight into the ways people with arthritis-related fatigue benefit from online social support, use OHI to support communication with health professionals and how they share health care for arthritis in online spaces. CONCLUSION: This research expanded on previous literature addressing the role of OHI and social media in the illness experience of arthritis-related fatigue. As technology use is increasing, particularly in the current extraordinary environment of social distancing, it is critical to address the role of OHI and social media in health care. In this study, OHI and social media played a prevalent role in the health care of many participants.","Muir, Julia; Hegarty, Roisin S M; Stebbings, Simon; Treharne, Gareth J",Musculoskeletal Care,,217

Informed by the frameworks of journalistic branding, the heuristic-systematic model, and hypertextual elements, the present study examines the extent to which the source factor (journalists? branding on social media profiles) and message factors (communication styles and hypertextual elements) influence visibility (i.e. the popularity of the account and the number of favourites and retweets of the posts). We analysed the Twitter profiles of 98 health journalists from seven major media organizations in the US and conducted a manual content analysis of a representative sample of their public tweets (n?=?3982) published during the Covid-19 pandemic. In contrast to expectations, branding contributed little to any indicators of visibility, and profiles with institutional branding had fewer followers. Both affective messages and rational messages received more likes and retweets than messages without these elements. Tweets containing images or news-related hyperlinks received more retweets, whereas the number of @mentions in a tweet was negatively related to visibility. Journalists from traditional media, those who tweeted more often, and those with more followers had higher levels of visibility.","Zhang, Xinzhi Zhu Rui",Journalism,,217

MATERIAL AND METHOD: Use of the formalized consensus method. RESULTS: The medical and surgical management of patients in andrology and sexual medicine must be adapted. Consultations should, as far as possible, be carried out by tele-consultation. For operative procedures, the delay between the operative decision and the date of (re)scheduling of the procedure will depend on: (1) the level of criticality of the clinical situation; (2) the type of intervention; (3) the functional and psychological repercussions, including quality of life while waiting for the procedure; (4) the notion of losing the chance of having an optimal outcome; (5) the risk of potential complications from delaying a procedure for too long; and (6) taking into account the patient's risk factors for severe forms of COVID-19. The protection of urologists from COVID-19 should be considered. Each urologist must make the best decision for the patient, taking into account the acceptable time frame and quality of life impact before surgical management, the COVID risk parameters, the technical and anesthetic feasibility and the structural possibility of the health care institution to ensure a specific dedicated pathway during the COVID-19 health crisis.

309212,Treatment concerns for psychiatric symptoms in patients with COVID-19 with or without psychiatric disorders,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a newly recognized infectious disease that has spread rapidly. COVID-19 has been associated with a number of cardiovascular complications, including arrhythmias. The mechanism of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with COVID-19 is uncertain. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the ventricular repolarization by using the Tp-e interval, QT dispersion, Tp-e/QT ratio, and Tp-e/QTc ratio as candidate markers of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with newly diagnosed COVID-19. In addition, the relationship between the repolarization parameters and the CRP (C-reactive protein) was investigated. METHODS: 75 newly diagnosed COVID-19 patients, 75 age and sex matched healthy subjects were included in the study between 20th March 2020 and 10th April 2020. The risk of ventricular arrhythmias was evaluated by calculating the electrocardiographic Tp-e and QT interval, Tp-e dispersion, corrected QT(QTc), QT dispersion (QTd), corrected QTd, Tp-e/QT and Tp-e/QTc ratios. CRP values were also measured in patients with newly diagnosed COVID-19. RESULTS: Tp-e interval (80.7â¯±â¯4.6 vs. 70.9â¯±â¯4.8; pâ¯<â¯.001), Tp-e / QT ratio (0.21â¯±â¯0.01 vs. 0.19â¯±â¯0.01; pâ¯<â¯.001) and Tp-e/QTc ratio (0.19â¯±â¯0.01 vs.0.17â¯±â¯0.01; pâ¯<â¯.001) were significantly higher in patients with newly diagnosed COVID-19 than the control group. There was a significant positive correlation between Tp-e interval, Tp-e/QTc ratio and CRP in patients with newly diagnosed COVID-19 (rsâ¯=â¯0.332, pâ¯=â¯.005, rsâ¯=â¯0.397, pâ¯<â¯.001 consecutively). During their treatment with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), azithromycin and favipiravir, ventricular tachycardia episodes were observed in in two COVID-19 patients during their hospitalization in the intensive care unit. CONCLUSION: Our study showed for the first time in literature that the Tp-e interval, Tp-e/QT ratio, and Tp-e/QTc ratio, which are evaluated electrocardiographically in patients with newly diagnosed COVID-19, were prolonged compared with normal healthy individuals. A positive correlation was determined between repolarization parameters and CRP. We believe that pre-treatment evaluation of repolarization parameters in newly diagnosed COVID-19 would be beneficial for predicting ventricular arrhythmia risk.","Yenerçag, Mustafa; Arslan, Ugur; Dogdus, Mustafa; Günal, Özgür; Öztürk, Çagatay Erman; Aksan, Gökhan; Erdogan, Güney; Gül, Sefa; Yontar, Osman Can; Sen, Ahmet",J Electrocardiol,,217

309907,Spike in Rhino-Orbital-Cerebral Mucormycosis Cases Presenting to a Tertiary Care Center During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Background: Autoimmune hyperthyroidism also known as Graves’ disease is the leading cause of hyperthyroidism. The pathogenesis of Graves’ disease is still an area of active research. We present a case of Graves’ disease, which developed following SARS-CoV2 infection. Clinical Case: A 43-year-old man with no prior history of thyroid disease, presented for evaluation due to fatigue palpitations, tremors, and hair loss in June 2020. Earlier that month, he was diagnosed with SARS-CoV2 infection and his thyroid function tests (TFTs) during a visit to the emergency department revealed thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level of &amp;lt;0.010 mIU/L (0.35-4.94) with a free T4 (FT4) 1.4 ng/dL (0.7-1.5);consistent with subclinical hyperthyroidism. He continued to report palpitations and tremors and further workup was done. A thyroid ultrasound showed two sub-centimeter nodules. A thyroid uptake scan followed, which showed heterogeneous activity in the thyroid gland, (12% and 32% uptake at 6 and 24 hours respectively) with focal increased uptake in the medial lobes, without cold nodules or hot nodules. Repeat TFTs one month later showed a suppressed TSH &amp;lt;0.010 mIU/L, and a normal FT4 1.3 ng/dL. Given suspicion for Graves’ disease, further labs were ordered. Thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) were found to be elevated at 173 % baseline (&amp;lt;=140). Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies and thyroglobulin antibodies were also elevated at 362 IU/mL H* (&amp;lt;=9) and 2 IU/mL H* (&amp;lt;=1) respectively. The overall picture was consistent with evolving early Graves’ disease. Conclusion: Multiple factors are frequently cited in the pathogenesis of autoimmune hyperthyroidism including viral and bacterial infections1 and there have been several reported cases of autoimmune disease related to SARS-CoV2 infection2. This case is one of several emerging cases of autoimmune hyperthyroidism possibly linked to COVID-19. References: 1. Smith, T. J . Graves’ Disease.

310967,The challenges and risk of laboratory handling on a histology specimen during COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Torch-light Eye Screening Test (TEST) is a simple eye screening technique designed for use by opticians to look for common anterior segment eye conditions. The TEACHES-Learning Electronic Module (TEACHES-LEM) is an e-learning platform that was developed to teach opticians to perform TEST. The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of TEACHES-LEM with face-to-face training (F2FT) in the training and assessment of knowledge among opticians. METHODS: Participants were randomly assigned in this experimental study to receive either the intervention group ((TEACHES-LEM, n = 60) or the control group (F2FT, n = 57). The conceptual knowledge of TEST was assessed with a 20-item clinical scenario-based multiple choice question (MCQ) test before and after teaching (immediately post-teaching and 1-month post-teaching). The MCQ test was developed by three ophthalmologists to give face validity. RESULTS: The pre-teaching test scores (TS), indicating prior knowledge, were comparable in both groups (10.02 ± 2.79 versus 10.40 ± 4.17, p = 0.563, independent t test). The mean immediate post teaching score for TEACHES-LEM was 13.3 ± 4.01 versus 12.3 ± 3.29 in the F2FT group (p = 0.170, independent t test). The mean post 1-month teaching score for TEACHES-LEM and F2FT groups were also comparable, 14.5 ± 4.19 versus 13.4 ± 3.90 respectively (p = 0.295, independent t test), indicating non-inferiority of TEACHES to F2FT. CONCLUSION: The TEACHES-LEM e-learning tool is as effective as F2FT in teaching opticians to perform TEST. It is an alternative to face-to-face teaching in delivering knowledge and assessment. The obviation for physical contact will make it a useful teaching tool during the COVID-19 pandemic period.","Chee, W K; Yip, C C; Yang, L; Soo, Y K; Wang, J; Chang, Bcm",Clin. teach,,217

311944,Letter to the Editor: Challenges to Neurosurgical Residency Training During COVID-19 Pandemic: An Indian Perspective,2020,"The Salt Overly Sensitive (SOS) pathway regulates intracellular sodium ion homeostasis as a salt-stress response in plants. This pathway involves three main genes designated as SOS1, SOS2, and SOS3, which are members of the Na+ /H+ exchanger (NHX), CBL-interacting protein kinase (CIPK), and Calcineurin B-like (CBL) gene families, respectively. To identify and characterize SOS genes in spinach (Spinacia oleracea), a species of the Amaranthaceae family, we conducted genome-wide identification and phylogenetic analyses of NHX, CIPK, and CBL genes from four Amaranthaceae species, Arabidopsis, and rice. Most Amaranthaceae genes exhibited orthologous relationships with Arabidopsis and/or rice, except a clade of Vac-type Amaranthaceae NHX genes. Phylogenetic analyses also revealed gene gain/loss events in Amaranthaceae species and the intron-less to intron-rich evolution of CIPK genes. A bacterial protein-rooted CIPK tree allowed naming most of the phylogenetic clades based on their evolutionary history. Single S. oleracea (So) SOS1, SOS2, and SOS3 proteins were identified. Direct protein-protein interaction was observed between SoSOS2 and SoSOS3 but not between SoSOS2 and SoSOS1 based on yeast two-hybrid assay. This may suggest distinct modes of action of spinach SOS proteins compared to Arabidopsis SOS proteins. Unlike SoSOS1 and SoSOS2, which were expressed at similar or higher levels in leaves than roots, SoSOS3 expression was significantly higher in roots than leaves, suggesting its greater importance in roots. The expression of SoSOS3 was upregulated in both roots and leaves under salinity compared to the control; however, SoSOS1 was only upregulated in roots. Thus, this study demonstrated the conservation of SOS pathway genes in spinach and also highlighted the complexity of SOS signaling in Amaranthaceae species. This article is protected by copyright.

The model classified the infected individuals based on their CD4 count level. Furthermore, education campaign, voluntary testing and counseling and treatment are considered as intervention strategies for controlling the disease. The analysis of the model reveals that imperfect public enlightenment campaign can induce backward bifurcation. It has been shown that when public enlightenment campaign is [Formula: see text] effective, the disease free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable for [Formula: see text], whereas for [Formula: see text] the global stability of the endemic equilibrium is proved only in a special case. Time dependent controls of the intervention strategies mentioned above are incorporated into the model and the optimal control strategies with minimal implementation cost are identified. In addition, cost effectiveness analysis in the form of incremental cost effectiveness ratio is carried-out to identify the most cost effective strategies. The results suggest that out of the three non dominated strategies, the strategy of educating the newly entrants only or combination of newly entrants and susceptible individuals is very cost effective using per capita GDP of Nigeria as at 2018. However, the choice of which strategy to implement depends on budgetary allocation and resource availability.","Ishaku, A; Gazali, A M; Abdullahi, S A; Hussaini, N",J Math Biol,,217

313401,Evaluating self-care barriers in prevention of COVID-19 according to healthcare experts and laypersons: a mixed study,2020,"In this paper, pre-monsoon (March – May) Cloud to Ground (CG) lightning activity over 6 mega cities (New Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad) in India is analysed with concentrations of four surface pollutants namely particulate matters (PM2.5, PM10), Sulphur dioxide (SO2) and Ozone for a period of 2018 to 2021 that includes the lockdown year 2020. Pollution greatly reduced with an enhancement of air quality in this year. Lightning data for the analysis is derived from the ground based lightning Network -Earth Networks Global Lightning Network (ENGLN). Among the mega cities, Kolkata faces most lightning whereas Mumbai receives the least. CG lightning flash counts significantly decrease in 2020 for Kolkata, Bengaluru, New Delhi and increase for Chennai, Hyderabad and Mumbai though the increase for the last two cities are very insignificant. This increase may be due to greater impact of meteorological factors on lightning than the pollutant concentrations. The lightning activity averaged over all the mega cities follows the trend of pollutant concentrations and average CG lightning flash counts go to minimum in the COVID-19 lockdown year 2020. Analysis also reveals that average seasonal CG lightning flash counts, average positive CG lightning flash counts and maximum peak CG currents show positive correlations with the concentration of all the four pollutants. The overall study shows that control of pollution may reduce the lightning activity in some lightning prone urban areas.","Gole, P. K.; Midya, S.

314331,The COVID-19 Pandemic and Global Neurosurgery: The Situation in Japan and the Philippines,2021,"UVC disinfection has been recognised by the WHO as an effective disinfection treatment to provide decentralized potable water. Under real conditions there are still unknowns that limit this application including the influence of suspended solids and natural organic matter. This work aims to investigate the influence of two key parameters, suspended solids and natural organic matter, on the efficiency of UVC disinfection of surface water to achieve the drinking water quality requirements established by the WHO for point of use (POU) technologies. Kaolinite (turbidity agent) and humic acids (HA, model of organic matter) were used in a factorial design of experiments (Turbidity from 0 to 5 NTU, and HA from 0 to 3.5 mg/L) to investigate their effect on UVC inactivation of MS2 phage in surface water. A collimated beam (12 W) and a commercial UVC disinfection flow system (16 W) designed to provide drinking water at households were used. The UVC flow system both in the laboratory and in the field was able to achieve the reduction requirements established by WHO (LRV >3.5 for all tested conditions), confirming the good performance of the studied UVC disinfection system. The results found in the lab were used to establish a numerical model that predicts the disinfection rate constant as a function of water turbidity and transmittance at 254 nm (confidence level>95%). The model permitted to elucidate the critical effect of low concentrations of HA in reducing the inactivation rate by 40% for 3.5 mg/L-HA compared with 0, the non-significant detrimental effect of turbidity lower than 5 NTU, and the lack of synergistic effects between both parameters at these levels. The UVC flow system was also tested in the field, in Tzabalho, Chiapas (Mexico), and Antioquia (Colombia), with spiked MS2 into natural surface water. This investigation opens a potential application to monitor the performance of UVC systems with surface water by monitoring transmittance at 254 nm as a tool to control UVC domestic systems to deliver safe drinking water in a household without the need of expensive and laborious biological monitoring tools.","Baldasso, Veronica; Lubarsky, Helen; Pichel, Natalia; Turolla, Andrea; Antonelli, Manuela; Hincapie, Margarita; Botero, Liliana; Reygadas, Fermin; Galdos-Balzategui, Ane; Byrne, J A; Fernandez-Ibañez, Pilar",Water Res,,217
314709,Neuropsychiatric disorders and COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 lockdown measures have caused severe disruptions to work and education, and prevented people from engaging in many rewarding activities. Cannabis users may be especially vulnerable, having been previously shown to have higher levels of apathy and anhedonia than non-users. METHODS: In this survey study, we measured apathy and anhedonia before and after lockdown measures were implemented, in n=256 adult and n=200 adolescent cannabis users, and n=170 adult and n=172 adolescent controls. Scores on the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) and Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS) were investigated with mixed measures Analyses of Covariance, with factors User-Group, Age-Group, and Time, controlling for depression, anxiety, and other drug use. RESULTS: Adolescent cannabis users had significantly higher SHAPS scores before lockdown, indicative of greater anhedonia, compared to adolescent controls (p=.03, Î·p 2=.013). Contrastingly, adult users had significantly lower scores on both the SHAPS (p<.001, Î·p 2=.030) and AES (p<.001, Î·p 2=.048) after lockdown, compared to adult controls. Scores on both scales increased during lockdown across groups, and this increase was significantly smaller for cannabis users (AES p=.001, Î·p 2=.014; SHAPS p=.01, Î·p 2=.008). Exploratory analyses revealed that dependent cannabis users had significantly higher scores overall (AES p<.001, Î·p 2=.037; SHAPS p<.001, Î·p 2=.029), and a larger increase in scores (AES p=.04, Î·p 2 .010; SHAPS p=.04, Î·p 2=.010), compared to non-dependent users. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that adolescents and adults have differential associations between cannabis use, and apathy and anhedonia. Within users, dependence may be associated with higher levels of apathy and anhedonia regardless of age, and a greater increase in levels during the COVID-19 lockdown.","Skumlien, Martine; Langley, Christelle; Lawn, Will; Voon, Valerie; Sahakian, Barbara J",Int. j. neuropsychopharmacol,,217

The horses developed diarrhoea and fever a few days after a laparotomy to treat gastrointestinal disease. Medical records were reviewed to identify the horses as well as to describe the primary intestinal disease, clinical findings, surgical intervention, FMT protocol, outcome and follow-up of each case. The principle of the efficacy of FMT is that restoration of a balanced nonpathogenic bacterial population may be the primary defence mechanism against colonization of pathogenic bacteria in the equine gastrointestinal tract. The FMT did not produce adverse reactions and was demonstrated to rapidly control diarrhoea and fever in all cases. A complete resolution of clinical sings was observed within 24 hours when horses were given a single FMT. Further clinical studies are necessary to determine the optimal preparation and to reinforce the efficacy of FMT for treating acute colitis following colic surgery.

Recently, strong improvement was shown for transfer learning and model generalization when increasing model, data and compute budget scale in the pre-training. To compare effect of scale both in intra- and inter-domain full and few-shot transfer, in this study we combine for the first time large openly available medical X-Ray chest imaging datasets to reach a dataset scale comparable to ImageNet-1k. We then conduct pre-training and transfer to different natural or medical targets while varying network size and source data scale and domain, being either large natural (ImageNet-1k/21k) or large medical chest X-Ray datasets. We observe strong improvement due to larger pre-training scale for intra-domain natural-natural and medical-medical transfer. For inter-domain natural-medical transfer, we find improvements due to larger pre-training scale on larger X-Ray targets in full shot regime, while for smaller targets and for few-shot regime the improvement is not visible. Remarkably, large networks pre-trained on very large natural ImageNet-21k are as good or better than networks pre-trained on largest available medical X-Ray data when performing transfer to large X-Ray targets. We conclude that high quality models for inter-domain transfer can be also obtained by substantially increasing scale of model and generic natural source data, removing necessity for large domain-specific medical source data in the pre-training.

Aerosols from these procedures may be inhaled by bystanders and there are consequent concerns regarding infection transmission, or, specific to nebulised therapy, secondary drug exposure. AIMS: Assess the efficacy of a proprietary HEPA-filtering extractor tent on reducing the aerosol dispersal of nebulised bronchodilator drugs. METHODS: The study was conducted in an unoccupied outpatient room at St. James's Hospital, Dublin. A novel real-time, fluorescent particle counter, the Wideband Integrated Bioaerosol Sensor (WIBS), monitored room air continuously for three hours. Baseline airborne particle counts and counts during nebulisation of bronchodilator drug solutions were recorded. FINDINGS: Nebulising within the tent prevented any increase over background levels, nebulising directly into room air resulted in mean fluorescent particle counts of 4.75 x 105/m3 and 4.21 x 105/m3 for Ventolin and Ipramol, respectively, representing more than 400-fold increases over the mean background count. >99.3% of drug particles were less than 2 µm in diameter, small enough to enter the lower respiratory tract. CONCLUSION: These results show the extractor tent was completely effective in preventing airborne spread of drug particles of respirable size from nebulised therapy. This suggests extractor tents of this kind would be efficacious in preventing airborne infection from aerosol-generating procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Fennelly, Mehael; Keane, Joseph; Dolan, Lorraine; Plant, Barry J; O039,; Connor, David; Sodeau, John; Prentice, Michael B",J. hosp. infect,,217

Except for lung injury, it is possible that COVID-19 patients develop liver injury. Thus, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore the incidence, risk factors, and prognosis of abnormal liver biochemical tests in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP, and Wanfang databases were searched. The incidence of abnormal liver biochemical tests, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), total bilirubin (TBIL), and albumin (ALB), was pooled. Risk ratio (RR) was calculated to explore the association of abnormal liver biochemical tests with severity and prognosis of COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Forty-five studies were included. The pooled incidence of any abnormal liver biochemical indicator at admission and during hospitalization was 27.2% and 36%, respectively. Among the abnormal liver biochemical indicators observed at admission, abnormal ALB was the most common, followed by GGT, AST, ALT, TBIL, and ALP (39.8%, 35.8%, 21.8%, 20.4%, 8.8%, and 4.7%). Among the abnormal liver biochemical indicators observed during hospitalization, abnormal ALT was more common than AST and TBIL (38.4%, 28.1%, and 23.2%). Severe and/or critical patients had a significantly higher pooled incidence of abnormal liver biochemical indicators at admission than mild and/or moderate patients. Non-survivors had a significantly higher incidence of abnormal liver biochemical indicators than survivors (RR = 1.34, p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal liver biochemical tests are common in COVID-19 patients. Liver biochemical indicators are closely related to the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 patients.","Wu, Yanyan; Li, Hongyu; Guo, Xiaozhong; Yoshida, Eric M; Mendez-Sanchez, Nahum; Levi Sandri, Giovanni Battista; Teschke, Rolf; Romeiro, Fernando Gomes; Shukla, Akash; Qi, Xingshun",Hepatol Int,,217

While many studies have focused on the effects of natural flavonoids in experimental models, reports based on clinical trials are still insufficient. In this review, we highlight the effects of flavonoids in controlling pulmonary diseases, particularly the acute respiratory distress syndrome, a consequence of COVID-19, and their potential use in coronavirus-related diseases.

Data on the COVID-19 epidemic that were analyzed in this study were obtained from the official websites of the National Health Commission of China and the Health Commissions of 31 provinces in China. From January 26 to February 25, 2020, the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in each region was counted daily using data from our database. Curve fitting of daily scatter plots of the relationship between epidemic growth rate (GR) with average temperature (AT) and average relative humidity (ARH) was conducted using the loess method. The heterogeneity across days and provinces was calculated to assess the necessity of using a longitudinal model. Fixed-effect models with polynomial terms were developed to quantify the relationship between variations in the GR and AT or ARH. An increased AT markedly reduced the GR when the AT was lower than -5°C, the GR was moderately reduced when the AT ranged from -5°C to 15°C, and the GR increased when the AT exceeded 15°C. ARH increased the GR when it was less than 72% and reduced the GR when it exceeded 72%. The temperature and relative humidity curves were not linearly associated with the GR of COVID-19. The GR was moderately reduced when the AT ranged from -5°C to 15°C. When the AT was lower or higher than -5°C to 15°C, the GR of COVID-19 increased.

The study investigates two extreme scenarios for the location of the source of infection within the wagon with four different air change rates for each. The first scenario considers the source of infection at the closest point to the ventilation system while the other places the infection source at the farthest point from the wagon ventilation system. The effect of the wagon windows' status (i.e. closed or open) is also studied. It is found that under all conditions, open windows are always favored to decrease the infection spreading potential. A higher air change rate also decreases the infection spreading up to a certain value, beyond which the effect is not noticeable. The location of the infection source was found to greatly affect the infection spreading as well. The paper gives recommendations on the minimum air change rate to keep the infection spreading potentials to a minimum considering different times the passengers stay in the wagon.","El-Salamony, Mostafa; Moharam, Ahmed; Guaily, Amr; Boraey, Mohammed A",,,217

DESIGN: A data-driven spatio-temporal modelling to simulate the spread of COVID-19 worldwide for 150 days since 1 January 2020 under different scenarios. SETTING: Worldwide. INTERVENTIONS: Travel restrictions and public health countermeasures. MAIN OUTCOME: The cumulative number of COVID-19 cases. RESULTS: The cumulative number of COVID-19 cases could reach more than 420 million around the world without any countermeasures taken. Under timely and intensive global interventions, 99.97% of infections could be avoided comparing with non-interventions. The scenario of carrying out domestic travel restriction and public health countermeasures in China only could contribute to a significant decrease of the cumulative number of infected cases worldwide. Without global travel restriction in the study setting, 98.62% of COVID-19 cases could be avoided by public health countermeasures in China only compared with non-interventions at all. CONCLUSIONS: Public health countermeasures were generally more effective than travel restrictions in many countries, suggesting multinational collaborations in the public health communities in response to this novel global health challenge.","Kong, Lingcai; Hu, Yi; Wang, Qiang; Chen, Xinda; Yao, Tong; Wang, Yu; Jin, Hui; Fan, Lijun; Du, Wei",BMJ Open,,217

Although mobile devices have become the primary means of accessing information on the web, many existing visualizations are not optimized for small screens and can lead to a frustrating user experience. Currently, practitioners and researchers have to engage in a tedious and time-consuming process to ensure that their designs scale to screens of different sizes, and existing toolkits and libraries provide little support in diagnosing and repairing issues. To address this challenge, MobileVisFixer automates a mobile-friendly visualization re-design process with a novel reinforcement learning framework. To inform the design of MobileVisFixer, we first collected and analyzed SVG-based visualizations on the web, and identified five common mobile-friendly issues. MobileVisFixer addresses four of these issues on single-view Cartesian visualizations with linear or discrete scales by a Markov Decision Process model that is both generalizable across various visualizations and fully explainable. MobileVisFixer deconstructs charts into declarative formats, and uses a greedy heuristic based on Policy Gradient methods to find solutions to this difficult, multi-criteria optimization problem in reasonable time. In addition, MobileVisFixer can be easily extended with the incorporation of optimization algorithms for data visualizations. Quantitative evaluation on two real-world datasets demonstrates the effectiveness and generalizability of our method.","Wu, Aoyu; Tong, Wai; Dwyer, Tim; Lee, Bongshin; Isenberg, Petra; Qu, Huamin",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06678v1.pdf,217

METHODS: We performed a retrospective study with patients under follow-up in rheumatology departments from seven hospitals in Spain. We matched updated databases of rheumatology patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-positive PCR tests performed in the hospital to the same reference populations. Rates of PCR+ confirmed COVID-19 were compared among groups. RESULTS: Patients with chronic inflammatory diseases had 1.32-fold higher prevalence of hospital PCR+ COVID-19 than the reference population (0.76% vs 0.58%). Patients with systemic autoimmune or immune-mediated disease (AI/IMID) showed a significant increase, whereas patients with inflammatory arthritis (IA) or systemic lupus erythematosus did not. COVID-19 cases in some but not all diagnostic groups had older ages than cases in the reference population. Patients with IA on targeted-synthetic or biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), but not those on conventional-synthetic DMARDs, had a greater prevalence despite a similar age distribution. CONCLUSION: Patients with AI/IMID show a variable risk of hospital-diagnosed COVID-19. Interplay of ageing, therapies and disease-specific factors seem to contribute. These data provide a basis to improve preventive recommendations to rheumatic patients and to analyse the specific factors involved in COVID-19 susceptibility.","Pablos, Jose L; Abasolo, Lydia; Alvaro-Gracia, Jose M; Blanco, Francisco J; Blanco, Ricardo; Castrejón, Isabel; Fernandez-Fernandez, David; Fernandez-Gutierrez, Benjamín; Galindo-Izquierdo, María; Gonzalez-Gay, Miguel A; Manrique-Arija, Sara; Mena Vázquez, Natalia; Mera Varela, Antonio; Retuerto, Miriam; Seijas-Lopez, Alvaro",Ann Rheum Dis,,217

327822,Do sleep quality and sleep duration before or after COVID-19 vaccination affect antibody response?,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Patients with inborn errors of immunity (IEI) have a compromised or inappropriate immune response. Although they might be considered a high-risk group for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, the reported impact of COVID-19 in these patients has been reassuring, while the differential susceptibility of distinct types of IEI remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to describe the findings and outcomes of our known patients with IEI who were diagnosed with COVID-19. METHODS: In a retrospective study from March 2020 to February 2021, four centers in Mexico collected clinical, laboratory, and genetic data from pediatric and adult patients with known diagnoses of IEI who presented with COVID-19, based on compatible symptoms and positive SARS-CoV-2 testing or known household exposure. RESULTS: We report 31 patients with known IEI from Mexico who presented with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Seventy-four percent were male, 52% were pediatric, and 81% survived. Their ages ranged from 5 months to 56 years, with a median of 17 years. Sixty-five percent had predominant antibody deficiencies, 48% were hospitalized, and 26% required ICU. Pediatric patients had a higher hospital admission rate than adults. Inpatient mortality was 40%, and ICU mortality rate was 63%. Forty-eight percent developed pneumonia, while 36% had evidence of hyperinflammation (4 adults and 7 children). Predominant laboratory features were lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia, seen in 70 and 44% of patients, respectively. The serum D-dimer median value was 2.6 (0.5-20.6) µg/mL, and the median highest ferritin value was 1015 (32-10,303) ng/mL. Intravenous immunoglobulin was used in 80% of patients. Other treatments included macrolides (39%) and corticosteroids (29%). Six patients died from secondary infection or uncontrolled systemic inflammation. DISCUSSION: Although impaired immunity due to IEI may be a predisposing factor for severe COVID-19, most of our patients with IEI who acquired the SARS-CoV-2 infection developed a well-tolerated infection and survived, as have more than 80% of worldwide reported patients to date. An impaired immune or inflammatory response may be a predisposing factor for some and a protective factor for others. A systematic review of the literature could help identify those patients at risk of severe disease and complications. Healthcare-associated infections should be aggressively prevented.","Castano-Jaramillo, Lina M; Yamazaki-Nakashimada, Marco Antonio; O039,; Farrill-Romanillos, Patricia M; Muzquiz Zermeño, David; Scheffler Mendoza, Selma C; Venegas Montoya, Edna; García Campos, Jorge Alberto; Sánchez-Sánchez, Luz María; Gámez González, Luisa B; Ramírez López, Jesús Moisés; Bustamante Ogando, Juan Carlos; Vásquez-Echeverri, Estefanía; Medina Torres, Edgar Alejandro; Lopez-Herrera, Gabriela; Blancas Galicia, Lizbeth; Berrón Ruiz, Laura; Staines-Boone, Aidé Tamara; Espinosa-Padilla, Sara Elva; Segura Mendez, Nora Hilda; Lugo Reyes, Saul O",J. clin. immunol,,217

We used a convenience sample of 707 university students (Mage = 22.99; SD = 4.01) from a central area of Italy. Participants freely joined the research by answering an online questionnaire between February and March 2020. Three time intervals defined by the progressive containment measures implemented by the Italian Government were considered. Main outcome measures were the Generalized Self-Efficacy Scale, the Risk Perception Index, the Index of Self-restraint Behaviours, and Institutional and Interpersonal Trust Measures. Results confirmed that significant changes in the time progression have occurred in the perception of risk, in the perception of individual self-efficacy, in the value attributed to social responsibility, in interpersonal trust and in trust in health authorities. The study also identified the participants' personality traits and locus of control as predictors (positive and negative) of perceived self-efficacy and tested a mediation model of trust on the effect of risk perception on self-restraint intentions.","Diotaiuti, Pierluigi; Valente, Giuseppe; Mancone, Stefania; Falese, Lavinia; Bellizzi, Fernando; Anastasi, Daniela; Langiano, Elisa; Dominski, Fábio Hech; Andrade, Alexandro",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,217

Between reality and dreams",2020,"The current study aimed to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of people with OCD and the degree of family accommodation (FA) by live-in family members across phases of the lockdown measures imposed by the Belgian government. Forty-nine OCD patients and 26 live-in family members participated in the study. We assessed OCD symptom severity and FA of the live-in family members, as well as depressive symptoms, anxiety and stress levels and COVID-19 related psychological distress of patients and family members at four different timepoints: one month after the start of the lockdown (T1), during the gradual relaxation (T2), between the two waves (T3) and during the second wave (T4). Results showed that although COVID-19 related stress increased and decreased in accordance with the waxing and waning pattern of the pandemic, OCD symptoms showed an initial slight increase followed by a decrease at T3 and again at T4. Changes in family members' accommodation of symptoms followed the same course as the OCD symptoms. Furthermore, OCD symptoms correlated with depressive symptoms, anxiety and stress levels and COVID-19 related distress at all timepoints. It is important to involve family members in the treatment of OCD even during a pandemic. Clinicians should also pay attention to symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress during OCD treatment. Further research is necessary to entangle the causal relationship between OCD symptoms, FA and symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress.","Tandt, Hannelore Ln; Debruyckere, Inge; Leyman, Lemke; Colman, Roos; De Jaeghere, Emiel A; Van Parys, Hanna; Baeken, Chris; Purdon, Christine; Lemmens, Gilbert Md",Psychiatr. q,,217

We surveyed 339 therapists about their professional practices and experiences during the pandemic. Results showed that on average therapists experienced moderate levels of vicarious trauma, whereas about 15% experienced high levels of vicarious trauma. A higher level of vicarious trauma was associated with younger age, less clinical experience, and negative online treatment experiences.

330739,The Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Electively Scheduled Hip and Knee Arthroplasty Patients in the United States,2020,"On March 11, 2020, WHO has defined the novel coronavirus disease SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) outbreak as a pandemic and still today continues to affect much of the world. Among the reasons for the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection, there is not only the high transmissibility of the virus, but also the role of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic carriers. Therefore diagnostic testing is central to contain the global pandemic. Up to now real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based molecular assays for detecting SARSCoV-2 in respiratory specimens is the current reference standard for COVID-19 diagnosis. Nasopharyngeal swab is the preferred choice for SARS-CoV-2 testing; however is not always a free of complications procedure. In patients with severe coagulopathies or diseases such as HHT, the risk of nosebleeding may be high. As in all those conditions like advanced stage sinonasal neoplasms or unfavorable anatomical characteristics, the nasopharyngeal swab may not be feasible. This work reports a safe and effective procedure of nasopharyngeal swab collection for COVID-19 testing, through the transoral way, in patients with contraindication to perform it transnasally. The procedure proved feasible and well tolerated. The discomfort for the patient is comparable with the execution of an oropharyngeal swab without exposing him to additional complications. In selected cases, the procedure described represents a valid alternative to nasopharyngeal swab performed transnasally. In particular, it allows reaching the area with the highest diagnostic sensitivity. Moreover it can be performed by Otolaryngology and, with adequate training, also by non-specialist staff.","Matti, Elina; Lizzio, Roberta; Spinozzi, Giuseppe; Ugolini, Sara; Maiorano, Eugenia; Benazzo, Marco; Pagella, Fabio",Am J Otolaryngol,,217

330974,Mental health in the aftermath of COVID-19: A new normal,2020,"Previous work has demonstrated that the epitranscriptomic addition of m6A to viral transcripts can promote the replication and pathogenicity of a wide range of DNA and RNA viruses, including HIV-1, yet the underlying mechanisms responsible for this effect have remained unclear. It is known that m6A function is largely mediated by cellular m6A binding proteins or readers, yet how these regulate viral gene expression in general, and HIV-1 gene expression in particular, has been controversial. Here, we confirm that m6A addition indeed regulates HIV-1 RNA expression and demonstrate that this effect is largely mediated by the nuclear m6A reader YTHDC1 and the cytoplasmic m6A reader YTHDF2. Both YTHDC1 and YTHDF2 bind to multiple distinct and overlapping sites on the HIV-1 RNA genome, with YTHDC1 recruitment serving to regulate the alternative splicing of HIV-1 RNAs. Unexpectedly, while YTHDF2 binding to m6A residues present on cellular mRNAs resulted in their destabilization as previously reported, YTHDF2 binding to m6A sites on HIV-1 transcripts resulted in a marked increase in the stability of these viral RNAs. Thus, YTHDF2 binding can exert diametrically opposite effects on RNA stability, depending on RNA sequence context.","Tsai, Kevin; Bogerd, Hal P; Kennedy, Edward M; Emery, Ann; Swanstrom, Ronald; Cullen, Bryan R",Genes dev,,217

Using a population-based stroke registry, we investigated the impact of the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in stroke admissions in Joinville, Brazil. METHODS: Patients admitted after the onset of COVID-19 restrictions in the city (defined as March 17, 2020) were compared with those admitted in 2019. We analyzed differences between stroke incidence, types, severity, reperfusion therapies, and time from stroke onset to admission. Statistical tests were also performed to compare the 30 days before and after COVID-19 to the same period in 2019. RESULTS: We observed a decrease in total stroke admissions from an average of 12.9/100 000 per month in 2019 to 8.3 after COVID-19 (P=0.0029). When compared with the same period in 2019, there was a 36.4% reduction in stroke admissions. There was no difference in admissions for severe stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score >8), intraparenchymal hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS: The onset of COVID-19 was correlated with a reduction in admissions for transient, mild, and moderate strokes. Given the need to prevent the worsening of symptoms and the occurrence of medical complications in these groups, a reorganization of the stroke-care networks is necessary to reduce collateral damage caused by COVID-19.","Diegoli, Henrique; Magalhães, Pedro S C; Martins, Sheila C O; Moro, Carla H C; França, Paulo H C; Safanelli, Juliana; Nagel, Vivian; Venancio, Vanessa G; Liberato, Rafaela B; Longo, Alexandre L",Stroke,,217

We performed 16 autopsies on cadavers of persons who had died with confirmed COVID-19 with different post-mortem intervals (PMI). To confirm the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, for each autopsy, 2 swabs were sampled from lungs, while to evaluate environmental contamination, 11 swabs were taken at three different times: T0 (before autopsy), T1 (at the end of the autopsy, without removing the corpse), and T2 (after cleaning and disinfecting the autopsy room). Specifically, 2 swabs were sampled on face shields used by each pathologist, and 4 swabs were collected on the autopsy table; 4 swabs were also collected from walls and 1 from floor. Lung swabs confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in all cases. Environmental swabs, collected at T0 and T2 were all negative, while swabs sampled at T1 were shown to be positive.

338760,Clinical and serological profile of asymptomatic and non-severe symptomatic COVID-19 cases: Lessons from primary care in Latin America,2020,"Identifying SARS-CoV-2 infections through aggressive diagnostic testing remains critical to tracking and curbing the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Collection of nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS), the preferred sample type for SARS-CoV-2 detection, has become difficult due to the dramatic increase in testing and consequent supply strain. Therefore, alternative specimen types have been investigated that provide similar detection sensitivity with reduced health care exposure and the potential for self-collection. In this study, the detection sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 in nasal swabs (NS) and saliva was compared to that of NPS using matched specimens from two outpatient cohorts in New York State (total n = 463). The first cohort showed only a 5.4% positivity, but the second cohort (n = 227) had a positivity rate of 41%, with sensitivity in NPS, NS, and saliva of 97.9%, 87.1%, and 87.1%, respectively. Whether the reduced sensitivity of NS or saliva is acceptable must be assessed in the settings where they are used. However, we sought to improve on it by validating a method to mix the two sample types, as the combination of nasal swab and saliva resulted in 94.6% SARS-CoV-2 detection sensitivity. Spiking experiments showed that combining them did not adversely affect the detection sensitivity in either.

The virus was stable in saliva at both 4°C and room temperature for up to 7 days.

338948,Psychosocial burden of healthcare professionals in times of COVID-19 - a survey conducted at the University Hospital Augsburg,2020,"Hypoxemic respiratory failure is a common manifestation of COVID-19 pneumonia. Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure were, at times, being intubated earlier than normal; in part because the options of heated humidified high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and non-invasive ventilation (NIV) were considered potentially inadequate and to increase risk of virus aerosolization. To understand the benefits and factors that predict success and failure of HFNC in this population, we evaluated data from the first 30 sequential patients admitted with COVID-19 pneumonia to our center who were managed with HFNC. We conducted Cox Proportional Hazards regression models to evaluate the factors associated with high flow nasal cannula failure (outcome variable), using time to intubation (censoring variable), while adjusting for comorbidities and immunosuppression. In the majority of our patients (76.7%), the use of HFNC failed and the patients were ultimately placed on mechanical ventilation. Those at increased risk of failure had a higher sequential organ failure assessment score, and at least one comorbidity or history of immunosuppression. Our data suggest that high flow nasal cannula may have a role in some patients with COVID-19 presenting with hypoxemic respiratory failure, but careful patient selection is the likely key to its success.","Garner, Orlando; Dongarwar, Deepa; Salihu, Hamisu M; Barrantes Perez, Jairo H; Abraham, Jocelyn; McBride, Cameron; Mathew, Sindhu; Antony, Preethi; Collins, Keegan; Richards, Katherine L; Howard, Christopher M",Respir Med,,217

341688,Minimising long-term effect of COVID-19 in dementia care,2020,"In this brief report, we describe the safety of reopening US Olympic and Paralympic Training facilities (USOPTFs) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic from July 2020 through October 2020. We evaluated the prevalence of COVID-19 infection at the time of reentry and cardiopulmonary sequelae of COVID-19 in elite athletes. All athletes returning to a USOPTF were required to go through a reentry protocol consisting of an electronic health history, a 6-day quarantine including twice-daily symptom surveys, COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction and antibody testing, physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, and pulmonary function testing. Athletes with current or prior COVID-19 infection also underwent an echocardiogram, cardiology consultation, and additional testing as indicated. All athletes followed rigorous infection prevention measures and minimized contact with the outside community following reentry. At the time of this report, 301 athletes completed the reentry protocol among which 14 (4.7%) tested positive for active (positive polymerase chain reaction test, n = 3) or prior (positive antibody test, n = 11) COVID-19 infection. During the study period, this cohort accrued 14,916 days living and training at USOPTFs. Only one (0.3%) athlete was subsequently diagnosed with a new COVID-19 infection. No cardiopulmonary pathology attributable to COVID-19 was detected. Our findings suggest that residential elite athlete training facilities can successfully resume activity during the COVID-19 pandemic when strict reentry and infection prevention measures are followed. Dissemination of our reentry quarantine and screening protocols with COVID-19 mitigation measures may assist the global sports and medical community develop best practices for reopening of similar training centers.","Shah, Ankit B; Nabhan, Dustin; Chapman, Robert; Chiampas, George; Drezner, Jonathan; Olin, J Tod; Taylor, David; Finnoff, Jonathan T; Baggish, Aaron L",Sports Health,,217

Adding to the complexity, some people believe the threat of COVID-19 is exaggerated. We used network analysis to investigate how these diverse elements are interrelated. METHODS: A population-representative sample of 3075 American and Canadian adults completed an online survey, including measures of COVID-19-related worry, avoidance, self-protective behaviors, and other variables. RESULTS: The network contained three major hubs, replicated across gender and age groups. The most important hub centered around worries about the dangerousness of COVID-19, and formed the core of the previously identified COVID Stress Syndrome. The second most important hub, which was negatively correlated with the first hub, centered around the belief that the COVID-19 threat is exaggerated, and was associated with disregard for social distancing, poor hand hygiene, and anti-vaccination attitudes. The third most important hub, which was linked to the first hub, centered around COVID-19-related compulsive checking and reassurance-seeking, including self-protective behaviors such as panic buying and use of personal protective equipment. CONCLUSION: Network analysis showed how various forms of worry, avoidance, coping, and other variables are interrelated.

In 2018, recorded infection control advice messages were affixed to 30% of England's automated hospital switchboards during the seasonal influenza and norovirus outbreaks. As the majority of messages were mandatory for all callers, healthcare professionals using the hospital switchboard - including during time-critical emergencies - had their enquiries significantly delayed by these measures. Importantly, published analyses did not demonstrate an association between these messages and patient outcomes. As of May 2020, 85% of NHS trusts made use of infection control messages; on average, these delayed healthcare professionals by 59.4 seconds per call, but had no clear association with patient outcomes from COVID-19. An ongoing national switchboard quality improvement project seeks to establish a gold standard whereby healthcare professionals with urgent enquiries can press 'X' to skip past infection control messages and have their calls triaged immediately.","Maclean, Edd; Ghelani, Rahul; Adra, Myra; Arora, Anshu; Naran, Prasheena; Illing, Heather; Knight, Megan; Banerjee, Sophie; Myers, Sam; Brecher, Joanna; Anderson, Sarah; Aylward, Charlotte; Bindra, Harmit; Carter, Christine; Dib, Naim; Ganis, Laura; Saliu, David; Towler-Tinlin, Andrew; Kerwat, Doaa Rajab; Richards, Eleanor; Johnston, James Noble; Low, Barney",Clin Med (Lond),,217

A retrospective study was conducted in patients with COVID-19 presenting with ischemic stroke from March 1 to May 25, 2020, and cases with large-vessel occlusion were identified. To provide baseline institutional stroke data within and outside the COVID-19 pandemic, all consecutive ischemic stroke and TIA admissions (COVID and non-COVID) to the hospital during a 10-week period from March 1 to May 10, 2020, were collected and compared with data from the same time period in 2019. Among 20 patients with COVID-19 and acute ischemic stroke, 15 (75%) had large-vessel occlusion. These patients were young (mean age, 46.5 years), male (93%), without major burden of traditional cardiovascular risk factors, and had a severe stroke presentation. Large-vessel occlusions were observed in multiple vessels (40%), uncommonly affected vessels, and atypical locations with a large thrombus burden. Systemic thrombosis separate from large-vessel occlusion was not uncommon (26%). At short-term follow-up, stroke etiology remained undetermined in 46% of patients and functional outcome was poor. The above findings raise the possibility of stroke related to mechanisms induced by the COVID-19 infection itself, including a hypercoagulable state and/or endothelial damage. In addition, they document the severe presentation and poor outcomes of large-vessel occlusion in COVID-19 ischemic stroke.","John, S; Kesav, P; Mifsud, V A; Piechowski-Jozwiak, B; Dibu, J; Bayrlee, A; Elkambergy, H; Roser, F; Elhammady, M S; Zahra, K; Hussain, S I",AJNR am. j. neuroradiology,,217

345050,"Dealing with COVID-19 in small European island states: Cyprus, Iceland and Malta",2020,"Background and Aims The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in associated lockdown restrictions for individuals across England, including the postponement of all recreational sporting provisions. The beneficial effects of regular physical activity are well established yet to the authors' knowledge, no research addresses the cancellation of all recreational provisions. Using quantitative and qualitative methods, this study assessed the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on recreational sports players, what alternative exercise methods have been sought and how players feel about returning to their sport. Method An online survey was distributed across England for six-weeks commencing in May 2020. A questionnaire explored differences in the impact of COVID-19 restrictions between sex, winter/summer/year-round sports, team/individual sports, age, and resilience groups. The use of alternative exercise methods, coping strategies and feelings about returning to sport were also investigated. Responses were gathered from 2023 adults whose recreational sport had been cancelled by COVID-19. All completed questionnaires (n= 1213) were taken for analysis (mean age = 49.41 years, SD = 17.165, 55.2% female). Results Quantitative findings showed the negative impact of COVID-19 restrictions was greater for females, those involved in winter and team sports, those aged 18-39 and low-resilient copers (p&lt;0.05). No significant differences were found between individuals that had had COVID-19 or were considered vulnerable by government guidelines. Acceptance was the most common coping strategy. The average number of days per week that participants exercised significantly increased during lockdown, with significant increases also seen in the use of online workouts, fitness apps and home-gym exercise. Qualitative findings suggested that participants are looking forward to the social and physical benefits of recreational activity restarting yet are concerned about the logistics of returning under social distancing restrictions. Other worries included loss of fitness, spreading (younger age groups) and catching (older age groups) COVID-19 and being in a crowd. Conclusions Results highlight what is currently accessible to home-based exercisers and inform the reintroduction of recreational sports clubs. As COVID-19 restrictions look to persist, club representatives should provide accessible home-exercise options and be cautious of participant concerns when considering the return of recreational sport.","Martin, Anna May Champ Francesca Franklin Zoe",Psychology of Sport and Exercise,,217

Antigen testing in self-collected saliva might be useful. We compared salivary and naso-pharyngeal swab (NPS) SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection by a rapid chemiluminescent assay (CLEIA) and two different point-of-care (POC) immunochromatographic assays, with results of molecular testing. METHODS: 234 patients were prospectively enrolled. Paired self-collected saliva (Salivette) and NPS were obtained to perform rRT-PCR, chemiluminescent (Lumipulse G) and POC (NPS: Fujirebio and Abbott; saliva: Fujirebio) for SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection. RESULTS: The overall agreement between NPS and saliva rRT-PCR was 78.7%, reaching 91.7% at the first week from symptoms. SARS-CoV-2 CLEIA antigen was highly accurate in distinguishing positive and negative NPS (ROC-AUC = 0.939, 95%CI:0.903-0.977), with 81.6% sensitivity and 93.8% specificity. This assay on saliva reached the optimal value within 7 days from symptoms onset (Sensitivity: 72%; Specificity: 97%). Saliva POC antigen was limited in sensitivity (13%), performing better in NPS (Sensitivity: 48% and 66%; Specificity: 100% and 99% for Espline and Abbott respectively), depending on viral loads. CONCLUSIONS: Self-collected saliva is a valid alternative to NPS for SARS-CoV-2 detection by molecular, but also by CLEIA antigen testing, which is therefore potentially useful for large scale screening.","Basso, Daniela; Aita, Ada; Padoan, Andrea; Cosma, Chiara; Navaglia, Filippo; Moz, Stefania; Contran, Nicole; Zambon, Carlo-Federico; Maria Cattelan, Anna; Plebani, Mario",Clin Chim Acta,,217

Several strategies were used by teachers worldwide to continue their teaching activities. Objective: to investigate the strategies and uses of ICT in medical education in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: Five databases were systematically assessed, using the terms ""COVID-19"", ""medical education"", ""higher education"" and ""students"", in Portuguese, English and Spanish, resulting in 321 initial citations, with 18 final references after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Result: Four key topics were identified in the literature: (1) Challenges for Medical Education prior to COVID-19; (2) Challenges in migrating to remote education; (3) Strategies to overcome challenges related to the learning environment; and (4) Strategies to overcome challenges related to assessments and exams. Conclusion: The use of ICT in medical education in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic showed to be especially important, with considerations regarding the improvement in areas that were already used, the migration of some more articulated areas and experiences in clinical and procedural disciplines. There was also concern about the impacts of using ICT to replace the in-person presence of students in medical learning environments.","Moretti-Pires, Rodrigo Otávio; Campos, Dalvan Antônio de; Tesser Junior, Zeno Carlos; Oliveira Junior, João Batista de; Turatti, Bárbara de Oliveira; Oliveira, Daniel Canavese de",Rev. bras. educ. méd,,217

348192,Erratum to: Families with Children with Neurodevelopmental Disorders during COVID-19: A Scoping Review,2021,"BACKGROUND: Given projected shortages of critical care capacity in public hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic, the South African government embarked on an initiative to purchase this capacity from private hospitals. In order to inform purchasing decisions, we assessed the cost-effectiveness of intensive care management for admitted COVID-19 patients across the public and private health systems in South Africa. METHODS: Using a modelling framework and health system perspective, costs and health outcomes of inpatient management of severe and critical COVID-19 patients in (1) general ward and intensive care (GW + ICU) versus (2) general ward only (GW) were assessed. Disability adjusted life years (DALYs) were evaluated and the cost per admission in public and private sectors was determined. The model made use of four variables: mortality rates, utilisation of inpatient days for each management approach, disability weights associated with severity of disease, and the unit cost per general ward day and per ICU day in public and private hospitals. Unit costs were multiplied by utilisation estimates to determine the cost per admission. DALYs were calculated as the sum of years of life lost (YLL) and years lived with disability (YLD). An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) - representing difference in costs and health outcomes of the two management strategies - was compared to a cost-effectiveness threshold to determine the value for money of expansion in ICU services during COVID-19 surges. RESULTS: A cost per admission of ZAR 75,127 was estimated for inpatient management of severe and critical COVID-19 patients in GW as opposed to ZAR 103,030 in GW + ICU. DALYs were 1.48 and 1.10 in GW versus GW + ICU, respectively. The ratio of difference in costs and health outcomes between the two management strategies produced an ICER of ZAR 73,091 per DALY averted, a value above the cost-effectiveness threshold of ZAR 38,465. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicated that purchasing ICU capacity from the private sector during COVID-19 surges may not be a cost-effective investment. The 'real time', rapid, pragmatic, and transparent nature of this analysis demonstrates an approach for evidence generation for decision making relating to the COVID-19 pandemic response and South Africa's wider priority setting agenda.","Cleary, S M; Wilkinson, T; Tamandjou Tchuem, C R; Docrat, S; Solanki, G C",BMC Health Serv Res,,217

Three of the known human coronaviruses: MERS, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen for the COVID-19 pandemic, cause severe disease. Improved methods to predict host specificity of coronaviruses will be valuable for identifying and controlling future outbreaks. The coronavirus S protein plays a key role in host specificity by attaching the virus to receptors on the cell membrane. We analyzed 1238 spike sequences for their host specificity. Spike sequences readily segregate in t-SNE embeddings into clusters of similar hosts and/or virus species. Machine learning with SVM, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest gave high average accuracies, F1 scores, sensitivities and specificities of 0.95-0.99. Importantly, sites identified by Decision Tree correspond to protein regions with known biological importance. These results demonstrate that spike sequences alone can be used to predict host specificity.","Kuzmin, Kiril; Adeniyi, Ayotomiwa Ezekiel; DaSouza, Arthur Kevin; Lim, Deuk; Nguyen, Huyen; Molina, Nuria Ramirez; Xiong, Lanqiao; Weber, Irene T; Harrison, Robert W",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,,217

Prior research has made opposing predictions as to the influence of religiosity. One stream predicts greater adherence because of rule-abiding norms and altruistic tendencies, whereas another has predicted lower adherence as a reaction against the restriction of personal and religious freedom. We used shelter-in-place directives as an intervention in a quasiexperiment to examine adherence over 30 days as a function of religiosity in the most populous metropolitan areas in the United States. When a shelter-in-place directive had not been imposed, religiosity did not affect people's movements. However, when the directive was imposed, higher religiosity resulted in less adherence to shelter-in-place directives.

In this study, the ability of the THERAFLEX UV-Platelets and THERAFLEX MB-Plasma pathogen inactivation systems to inactivate these viruses in platelet concentrates and plasma, respectively, was investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood products were spiked with SARS-CoV, CCHFV or NiV, and then treated with increasing doses of UVC light (THERAFLEX UV-Platelets) or with methylene blue (MB) plus increasing doses of visible light (MB/light; THERAFLEX MB-Plasma). Samples were taken before and after treatment with each illumination dose and tested for residual infectivity. RESULTS: Treatment with half to three-fourths of the full UVC dose (0·2 J/cm2 ) reduced the infectivity of SARS-CoV (&#8805;3·4 log), CCHFV (&#8805;2·2 log) and NiV (&#8805;4·3 log) to the limit of detection (LOD) in platelet concentrates, and treatment with MB and a fourth of the full light dose (120 J/cm2 ) decreased that of SARS-CoV (&#8805;3·1 log), CCHFV (&#8805;3·2 log) and NiV (&#8805;2·7 log) to the LOD in plasma. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that both THERAFLEX UV-Platelets (UVC) and THERAFLEX MB-Plasma (MB/light) effectively reduce the infectivity of SARS-CoV, CCHFV and NiV in platelet concentrates and plasma, respectively.","Eickmann, Markus; Gravemann, Ute; Handke, Wiebke; Tolksdorf, Frank; Reichenberg, Stefan; Müller, Thomas H; Seltsam, Axel",Vox Sang,,217

To meet capacity demands, hospitals around the world suspended surgeries deemed to be elective. In hand surgery, numerous pathologies are treated on an elective basis, but a delay or absence of care may result in poorer outcomes. Here, we present an ethical framework for prioritizing elective surgery during a period of resource scarcity. Instead of using the term ""elective,"" we define procedures that can be safely delayed on the basis of 3 considerations. First, a safe delay is possible only if deferral will not result in permanent injury. Second, a delay in care will come with tolerable costs and impositions that can be appropriately managed in the future. Third, a safe delay will preserve the bioethical principle of patient autonomy. In considering these criteria, 3 case examples are discussed considering individual patient characteristics and the pathophysiology of the condition. This framework design is applicable to ambulatory surgery in any period of crisis that may strain resources, but further considerations may be important if an operation requires hospital admission.","Lockey, Stephen D; Nelson, Philip C; Kessler, Michael J; Kessler, Michael W",,,217

Myocardial injury occurs in approximately one-quarter of hospitalized patients and is associated with a greater need for mechanical ventilator support and higher hospital mortality. The central pathophysiology underlying cardiovascular injury is the interplay between virus binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor and the impact this action has on the renin-angiotensin system, the body's innate immune response, and the vascular response to cytokine production. The purpose of this review was to describe the mechanisms underlying cardiovascular injury, including that of thromboembolic disease and arrhythmia, and to discuss their clinical sequelae.","Giustino, Gennaro; Pinney, Sean P; Lala, Anuradha; Reddy, Vivek Y; Johnston-Cox, Hillary A; Mechanick, Jeffrey I; Halperin, Jonathan L; Fuster, Valentin",J Am Coll Cardiol,,217

The presence of a N-O bond in the ring prevents the planar geometry of the aromatic system and induces a strong decrease in the basicity of the guanidine moiety. While DIBAL-H appeared to be the most efficient reducing agent because it exhibited high diastereoselectivity, we observed various behaviors of the Mitsunobu reaction on the resulting ß-aminoalcohol, leading to either inversion or retention of the configuration depending on the steric hindrance in the vicinity of the hydroxy group. The physicochemical properties (pKa and log D) and hepatic stability of several AOXD derivatives were experimentally determined and found that the AOXD scaffold possesses promising properties for drug development. Moreover, we synthesized alchornedine, the only natural product with the AOXD scaffold.

354870,Effect of COVID-19 pandemic on global Bariatric surgery PRActiceS - The COBRAS study,2021,"The progress of evolutionary biology has revealed that symbiosis played a basic role in the evolution of complex eukaryotic organisms, including humans. Mitochondria are actually simplified endosymbiotic bacteria currently playing the role of cellular organelles. Mitochondrial domestication occurred at the very beginning of eukaryotic evolution. Mitochondria have two different basic functions: they produce energy using oxidative respiration, and they initiate different forms of apoptotic programmed/regulated cell death. Apoptotic programmed cell death may have different cytological forms. Mechanisms of apoptotic programmed cell death exist even in the unicellular organisms, and they play a basic role in the development of complex multicellular organisms, such as fungi, green plants, and animals. Multicellularity was independently established many times among eukaryotes. There are indications that apoptotic programmed cell death is a trait required for the establishment of multicellularity. Regulated cell death is initiated by many different parallel biochemical pathways. It is generally accepted that apoptosis evolved during mitochondrial domestication. However, there are different hypothetical models of the origin of apoptosis. The phylogenetic studies of my group indicate that apoptosis probably evolved during an evolutionary arms race between host ancestral eukaryotic predators and ancestral prey mitochondria (named protomitochondria). Protomitochondrial prey produced many different toxins as a defense against predators. From these toxins evolved extant apoptotic factors. There are indications that aerobic respiration and apoptosis co-evolved and are functionally linked in extant organisms. Perturbations of apoptosis and oxidative respiration are frequently observed during neoplastic transition. Our group showed that perturbations of apoptosis in yeasts also cause perturbations of oxidative respiration.","Kaczanowski, Szymon",Results Probl Cell Differ,,217

Coronaviruses are enveloped, single strand RNA viruses that have been known to have the ability to mutate rapidly, alter tissue tropism and adjust to different epidemiological situations. As of the end of April 2020, 122,392 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 had been detected in Turkey, of whom 3,258 died. From the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic, children seem to be less affected than adults. Therefore, there are limited data regarding the clinical features of COVID-19 in children. The majority of children with confirmed COVID-19 had a history of household contact. The most common symptoms were fever and cough. Previous data suggest that nearly half of patients are afebrile at the onset of the disease. Hospitalization and PICU admission rates for children were lower than for adults. However, PICU admission can be necessitated in children with severe disease. Infants, particularly under the age of 12 months, were more likely to develop severe disease. In children, milder and asymptomatic cases can be challenging and can play a role in transmission. In particular, clinicians should test those children who have a history of family cluster even though they are asymptomatic or present with mild symptoms.","Bal, Zümrüt Şahbudak; Kurugöl, Zafer; Özkınay, Ferda",J.

For urologists, it has affected and will continue to influence how we approach the care of patients preoperatively, intraoperatively, and postoperatively. A risk-benefit assessment of each patient undergoing surgery should be performed during the COVID-19 pandemic based on the urgency of the surgery and the risk of viral illness and transmission. Patients with advanced age and comorbidities have a higher incidence of mortality. Routine preoperative testing and symptom screening is recommended to identify those with COVID-19. Adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) for the surgical team is essential to protect health care workers and ensure an adequate workforce. For COVID-19 positive or suspected patients, the use of N95 respirators is recommended if available. The anesthesia method chosen should attempt to minimize aerosolization of the virus. Negative pressure rooms are strongly preferred for intubation/extubation and other aerosolizing procedures for COVID-19 positive patients or when COVID status is unknown. Although transmission has not yet been shown during laparoscopic and robotic procedures, efforts should be made to minimize the risk of aerosolization. Ultra-low particulate air filters are recommended for use during minimally invasive procedures to decrease the risk of viral transmission. Thorough cleaning and sterilization should be performed postoperatively with adequate time allowed for the operating room air to be cycled after procedures. COVID-19 patients should be separated from noninfected patients at all levels of care, including recovery, to decrease the risk of infection. Future directions will be guided by outcomes and infection rates as social distancing guidelines are relaxed and more surgical procedures are reintroduced. Recommendations should be adapted to the local environment and will continue to evolve as more data become available, the shortage of testing and PPE is resolved, and a vaccine and therapeutics for COVID-19 are developed.","Steward, James E; Kitley, Weston R; Schmidt, C Max; Sundaram, Chandru P",J Endourol,,217

We report on the deployment of emergency services for cardiovascular events in a defined region in western Germany during the government-imposed lock-down period. METHODS: We examined 5799 consecutive patients who were treated by emergency services for cardiovascular events during the Covid-19 pandemic (January 1 to April 30, 2020), and compared those to the corresponding time frame in 2019. Examining the emergency physicians' records provided by nine locations in the area, we found a 20% overall decline in cardiovascular admissions. RESULTS: The greatest reduction could be seen immediately following the government-imposed social restrictions. This reduction was mainly driven by a reduction in discretionary admissions for dizziness/syncope (-53%), heart failure (-38%), exacerbated COPD (-28%) and unstable angina (-23%), while unavoidable admissions for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and stroke were unchanged. There was a greater decline in emergency admissions for patients &#8805;60 years. There was also a greater reduction in emergency admissions for those living in urban areas compared to suburban areas. CONCLUSIONS: During the Covid-19 pandemic, a significant decline in hospitalization for cardiovascular events was observed during the government-enforced shutdown in a predefined area in western Germany.

Hence this research study seeks to identify critical factors influencing Indian people's attitudes and intentions to take up Covid-19 vaccinations. METHODS: An online questionnaire was administered to a sample (n = 254) drawn from Indian population, to assess the impact of perceived benefits, risk perceptions, social media exposure, social norms, and trust associated with Covid-19 vaccines on people's attitudes towards Covid-19 vaccines and their intentions to take up the Covid-19 vaccinations. RESULTS: The findings showed that the perceived benefits, social norms, and trust correlated significantly with people's attitudes towards Covid-19 vaccinations. In contrast, risk perceptions and social media exposure showed an insignificant influence on people's attitudes towards Covid-19 vaccinations. Social norms, trust, and people's attitudes towards the Covid-19 vaccinations are significantly correlated with their intentions to take up Covid-19 vaccinations. On the contrary, social media exposure was found to have an insignificant influence on people's intentions to take up Covid-19 vaccinations. CONCLUSION: Participants' intentions to take up Covid-19 vaccinations was influenced mainly by their attitudes and perceptions of Covid-19 vaccines in general, which strongly confirms the importance of various dimensions (perceived benefits, trust, social norms) of Covid-19 vaccines in cultivating Covid-19 vaccination acceptance among participants'.","Mir, Hilal Hamid; Parveen, Subeena; Mullick, Naushadul Haque; Nabi, Shazia",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,217

356470,Telehealth and Autism Prior to and in the Age of COVID-19: A Systematic and Critical Review of the Last Decade,2021,"Education in the Eastern Caribbean has been heavily influenced by the colonial history of the sub-region. In recent years though, in recognition of the fact that the traditional approaches to teaching and learning are no longer meeting the needs of present-day students, there have been calls for change to more student-friendly ones, with electronic technology playing a significant role. However, the resistance to certain types of devices in the classroom has contributed to the slow uptake of widespread use of electronic technology and the online environment as a mode for teaching and learning. The closure of schools due to the advent of COVID-19 pandemic forced education systems in the region to turn to the online environment to engage students in educational activities. Students, teachers and other education officials had to face their apprehensions and venture into this space for schooling. This paper describes actions taken by the Eastern Caribbean Joint Board of Teacher Education to help teachers cope with this different learning environment, guided by the concepts of teacher readiness, equity relating to access of resources and providing caring support for all affected.","Leacock, Coreen J.; Warrican, S.

358057,Localized Scarlatiniform Rash of the Ears and Antecubital Fossa in COVID-19,2021,"On May 13, 2020, Chicago established a free community-based testing (CBT) initiative for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The initiative focused on demographic groups and geographic areas that were underrepresented in testing by clinical providers and had experienced high COVID-19 incidence, including Hispanic persons and those who have been economically marginalized. To assess the CBT initiative, the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) compared demographic characteristics, economic marginalization, and test positivity between persons tested at CBT sites and persons tested in all other testing settings in Chicago. During May 13-November 14, a total of 253,904 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests were conducted at CBT sites. Compared with those tested in all other testing settings in Chicago, persons tested at CBT sites were more likely to live in areas that are economically marginalized (38.6% versus 32.0%; p<0.001) and to be Hispanic (50.9% versus 20.7%; p<0.001). The cumulative percentage of positive test results at the CBT sites was higher than that at all other testing settings (11.1% versus 7.1%; p<0.001). These results demonstrate the ability of public health departments to establish community-based testing initiatives that reach communities with less access to testing in other settings and that experience disproportionately higher incidences of COVID-19.","English, Kayla; Lei, Uei; Shipman-Amuwo, Frankie; Burkey, Micah; González, José G; Richardson, Sarah; Chavez-Torres, Maribel; Arwady, M Allison; Anderson, Christina; Layden, Jennifer E; Ruestow, Peter; Pacilli, Massimo; Ghinai, Isaac",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,217

359609,Perception of a Tracing App During the Covid-19 Pandemic in Germany,2021,"Proteins function in the crowded cellular environments with high salt concentrations, thus facing tremendous challenges of misfolding/aggregation which represents a pathological hallmark of aging and an increasing spectrum of human diseases. Recently, intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) were recognized to drive liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), a common principle for organizing cellular membraneless organelles (MLOs). ATP, the universal energy currency for all living cells, mysteriously has concentrations of 2-12 mM, much higher than required for its previously-known functions. Only recently, ATP was decoded to behave as a biological hydrotrope to inhibit protein LLPS and aggregation at mM. We further revealed that ATP also acts as a bivalent binder, which not only biphasically modulates LLPS driven by IDRs of human and viral proteins, but also bind to the conserved nucleic-acid-binding surfaces of the folded proteins. Most unexpectedly, ATP appears to act as a hydration mediator to antagonize the crowding-induced destabilization as well as to enhance folding of proteins without significant binding. Here, this review focuses on summarizing the results of these biophysical studies and discussing their implications in an evolutionary context. By linking triphosphate with unique hydration property to adenosine, ATP appears to couple the ability for establishing hydrophobic, &#960;-&#960;, &#960;-cation and electrostatic interactions to the capacity in mediating hydration of proteins, which is at the heart of folding, dynamics, stability, phase separation and aggregation. Consequently, ATP acquired a category of functions at ~mM to energy-independently control protein homeostasis with diverse mechanisms, thus implying a link between cellular ATP concentrations and protein-aggregation diseases.","Song, Jianxing",Protein sci,,217

360636,COVID-19 and residential aged care: priorities for optimising preparation and management of outbreaks,2020,"BACKGROUND: We detected yellow-green fluorescence in the face, hair and lunulae of patients using favipiravir. AIM: We evaluated the frequency and intensity of favipiravir-associated fluorescence. PATIENTS/METHODS: The participants comprised patients who had taken at least a single dose of favipiravir and been examined no later than 30 days after the last dose. The gender, age, body mass index (BMI), Fitzpatrick's skin-type, hair color, N-acetylcysteine use, presence and the intensity of fluorescent reflection under Wood's light in the lunulae of the fingernails, hair, and the face were recorded. RESULTS: There were 275 patients, 144 (52.4%) of whom were women. 165 (57.9%) had used treatment for a maximum of 5 days, 99 (34.7%) for 6-10 days, and 21 (7.4%) for more than ten days. Using more than 22 tablets of favipiravir increased the probability of detecting fluorescence in the lunulae by 6.72 (2.61-17.23) times. Using more than 28 tablets increased the risk of fluorescence in hair and the T-zone by 5.92 (2.43-14.71) and 2.88 (1.11-7.47) times, respectively. No relationship was found between the fluorescence intensity in any localization and the total dose. However, we determined a negative correlation between the elapsed time after the last dose and the fluorescence intensity in the lunulae and the T-zone (p=0.036; p=0.031; respectively). It was noted that BMI negatively correlated with the fluorescence intensity in the lunulae (p=0.001). Skin type was related to intensity for all localizations (p<0.001). Fluorescence was found in the lunulae with significantly less frequency in patients using N-acetylcysteine (p=0.040). CONCLUSIONS: We must be aware of favipiravir-induced phototoxicity.","Turan, Çagri; Metin, Nurcan; Utlu, Zeynep; Yildiz, Türkan Tugba; Caferoglu Sakat, Selcen",J. cosmet. dermatol,,217

360905,Changing paradigms of dermatology practice in developing nations in the shadow of COVID-19: Lessons learnt from the pandemic,2020,"Objective: Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the cellular entry point for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)-the cause of COVID-19 disease. However, the effect of RAS-inhibition on ACE2 expression in human tissues of key relevance to blood pressure regulation and COVID-19 infection has not previously been reported Design and method: We examined how hypertension, its major metabolic cophenotypes and antihypertensive medications relate to ACE2 renal expression using information from up to 436 patients whose kidney transcriptomes were characterised by RNA-sequencing. We further validated some of the key observations in other human tissues and/or a controlled experimental model Results: Our data reveal increasing expression of ACE2 with age in both human lungs and the kidney. We show no association between renal expression of ACE2 and either hypertension or common types of RAS inhibiting drugs. We demonstrate that renal abundance of ACE2 is positively associated with a biochemical index of kidney function and show a strong enrichment for genes responsible for kidney health and disease in ACE2 co-expression analysis Conclusions: Our results indicate that neither hypertension nor antihypertensive treatment are likely to alter the expression of the key entry receptor for SARSCoV-2 in the human kidney. Our data further suggest that in the absence of SARSCoV-2 infection, kidney ACE2 is most likely nephro-protective but the age-related increase in its expression within lungs and kidneys may be relevant to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Jiang, X.; Eales, J.; Scannali, D.; Nazgiewicz, A.; Prestes, P.; Maier, M.; Denniff, M.; Xu, X.; Saluja, S.; Wystrychowski, W.; Zywiec, J.; Zukowska-Szczechowska, E.; Burrell, L.

363159,Resource requirements for reintroducing elective surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic: modelling study,2021,"The current COVID-19 pandemic started several months ago and is still exponentially growing in most parts of the world - this is the most recent and alarming update. COVID-19 requires the collaboration of nearly 200 countries to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2 while gaining time to explore and improve treatment options especially for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and immunocompromised patients, who appear to be at high-risk to die from cardiopulmonary failure. Currently unanswered questions are why elderly people, particularly those with pre-existing comorbidities seem to exhibit higher mortality rates after SARS-CoV-2 infection and whether intensive care becomes indispensable for these patients to prevent multi-organ failure and sudden death. To face these challenges, we here summarize the molecular insights into viral infection mechanisms and implications for cardiovascular disease. Since the infection starts in the upper respiratory system, first flu-like symptoms develop that spread throughout the body. The wide range of affected organs is presumably based on the common expression of the major SARS-CoV-2 entry-receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Physiologically, ACE2 degrades angiotensin II, the master regulator of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), thereby converting it into vasodilatory molecules, which have well-documented cardio-protective effects. Thus, RAAS inhibitors, which may increase the expression levels of ACE2, are commonly used for the treatment of hypertension and CVD. This, and the fact that SARS-CoV-2 hijacks ACE2 for cell-entry, have spurred controversial discussions on the role of ACE2 in COVID-19 patients. In this review, we highlight the state-of-the-art knowledge on SARS-CoV-2-dependent mechanisms and the potential interaction with ACE2 expression and cell surface localization. We aim to provide a list of potential treatment options and a better understanding of why CVD is a high risk factor for COVID-19 susceptibility and further discuss the acute as well as long-term cardiac consequences.","Groß, Sonja; Jahn, Christopher; Cushman, Sarah; Bär, Christian; Thum, Thomas",J Mol Cell Cardiol,,217

SARS-CoV-2 uses spike glycoprotein to interact with host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and ensure cell recognition. High infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 raises questions on spike-ACE2 binding affinity and its neutralization by anti-SARS-CoV monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Here, we observed Val-to-Lys417 mutation in the receptor-binding domains (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2, which established a Lys-Asp electrostatic interaction enhancing its ACE2-binding. Pro-to-Ala475 substitution and Gly482 insertion in the AGSTPCNGV-loop of RBD possibly hinders neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by anti-SARS-CoV mAbs. In addition, we identified unique and structurally conserved conformational-epitopes on RBDs, which can be potential therapeutic targets. Collectively, we provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the high infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 and development of effective neutralizing agents.","Shah, Masaud; Ahmad, Bilal; Choi, Sangdun; Goo Woo, Hyun",,,217
363988,Hamstringing the Health Technology Response to Covid-19: The Burdens of Exclusivity and Policy Solutions (preprint),2021,"Over 20 million children under 5 years old in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region have stunted growth, as a result of chronic malnutrition, with damaging long-term consequences for individuals and societies. This review extracted and analyzed data from the UNICEF, WHO and the World Bank malnutrition estimates to present an overall picture of childhood stunting in the region. The number of children under 5 in the region who are affected by stunting has dropped from 24.5 million (40%) in 1990 to 20.6 million (24.2%) in 2019. The reduction rate since the 2012 baseline is only about two fifths of that required and much more rapid progress will be needed to reach the internationally agreed targets by 2025 and 2030. Prevalence is highest in low-income countries and those with a lower Human Development Index. The COVID-19 pandemic threatens to undermine efforts to reduce stunting, through its impact on access and affordability of safe and nutritious foods and access to important health services. Priority areas for action to tackle stunting as part of a comprehensive, multisectoral nutrition strategy are proposed. In light of the threat that COVID-19 will exacerbate the already heavy burden of malnutrition in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, implementation of such strategies is more important than ever.","Jawaldeh, Ayoub Al; Doggui, Radhouene; Borghi, Elaine; Aguenaou, Hassan; Ammari, Laila El; Abul-Fadl, Azza; McColl, Karen",,,217

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Full-time faculty of 2 academic otolaryngology departments in New York City were surveyed regarding their telemedicine use from March through August 2020 during the ""first wave"" of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on these findings, a method of ""augmented outpatient otolaryngology teleconsultation"" designed to enhance the quality of the physical examination was developed and employed from August to December 2020. Patients receiving this augmented teleconsult were anonymously surveyed about their telemedical experience. RESULTS: Telemedicine use by faculty was minimal prior to the pandemic, but as total outpatient volume decreased 65-84% across subspecialties, it was used by all otolaryngologists during COVID-19. Physicians were less confident in making a telemedical diagnosis at all phases of the study in all subspecialties. Patients who had an augmented otolaryngology teleconsultation were satisfied with it, believed it facilitated earlier care, limited the time and cost of travel to the physician's office and felt their physician was able to perform a sufficient physical examination. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 crisis, physicians utilized teleotolaryngology to provide care but were less satisfied with their ability to make an accurate diagnosis. Inexpensive direct-to-consumer digital otoscopes can improve the quality of the physical examination provided and can address both patient and physician needs.","Sclafani, Anthony P; Shomorony, Andre; Stewart, Michael G; Grunstein, Eli; Overdevest, Jonathan B",Am J Otolaryngol,,217

The community prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike protein antibodies provides an estimate of total cumulative response to natural infection and vaccination. We describe the distribution of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in adults in England in May 2021 at a time when approximately 7 in 10 adults had received at least one dose of vaccine. MethodsSixth round of REACT-2 (REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-2), a cross-sectional random community survey of adults in England, from 12 to 25 May 2021; 207,337 participants completed questionnaires and self-administered a lateral flow immunoassay test producing a positive or negative result. ResultsVaccine coverage with one or more doses, weighted to the adult population in England, was 72.9% (95% confidence interval 72.7-73.0), varying by age from 25.1% (24.5-25.6) of those aged 18 to 24 years, to 99.2% (99.1-99.3) of those 75 years and older. In adjusted models, odds of vaccination were lower in men (odds ratio [OR] 0.89 [0.85-0.94]) than women, and in people of Black (0.41 [0.34-0.49]) compared to white ethnicity. There was higher vaccine coverage in the least deprived and highest income households. People who reported a history of COVID-19 were less likely to be vaccinated (OR 0.61 [0.55-0.67]). There was high coverage among health workers (OR 9.84 [8.79-11.02] and care workers (OR 4.17 [3.20-5.43]) compared to non-key workers, but lower in hospitality and retail workers (OR 0.73 [0.64-0.82] and 0.77 [0.70-0.85] respectively) after adjusting for age and key covariates. The prevalence of antibodies (weighted to the adult population of England and adjusted for test characteristics) was 61.1% (95% CI 60.9-61.4), up from 6.6% (5.4-5.7) in round 4 (27 October to 10 November 2020) and 13.9% (13.7-14.1) in round 5 (26 January to 8 February 2021). Prevalence (adjusted and weighted) increased with age, from 35.8% (35.1-36.5) in those aged 18 to 24 years, to 95.3% (94.6-95.9) in people 75 and over. Antibodies were 30% less likely to be detected in men than women (adjusted OR 0.69, 0.68-0.70), and were higher in people of Asian (OR 1.67 [1.58-1.77]), Black (1.55 [1.41-1.69]), mixed 1.17 [1.06-1.29] and other (1.37 [1.23-1.51]) ethnicities compared with white ethnicity. Workers in hospitality (OR 0.69 [0.63-0.74]) and retail (0.71 [0.67-0.75]) were less likely to have antibodies. Following two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, antibody positivity (adjusted for test performance) was 100% (100-100) at all ages except 80 years and older when it was 97.8% (95.9-99.6). For AstraZeneca positivity was over 90% up to age 69, and then 89.2% (88.5-89.9) in 70-79 year olds and 83.6% (78.5-88.3) in those aged 80 and over. Following a single dose of Pfizer-BioNTech positivity ranged from 100.0% (91.1-100.0) in those aged 18-29 to 32.2% (18.2-51.1) in those aged 70-79 years. For AstraZeneca this was 72.2% (68.5-75.9) in the youngest and 46.2% (40.0-52.7) in the oldest age group. DiscussionThe successful roll out of the vaccination programme in England has led to a high proportion of individuals having detectable antibodies, particularly in older age groups and those who have had two doses of vaccine. This is likely to be associated with high levels of protection from severe disease, and possibly from infection. Nonetheless, there remain some key groups with a lower prevalence of antibody, notably unvaccinated younger people, certain minority ethnic groups, those living in deprived areas and workers in some public facing employment. Obtaining improved rates of vaccination in these groups is essential to achieving high levels of protection against the virus through population immunity.

368447,The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Vascular Surgery Trainees in the United States,2020,"Computed tomography (CT) reconstruction from X-ray projections acquired within a limited angle range is challenging, especially when the angle range is extremely small. Both analytical and iterative models need more projections for effective modeling. Deep learning methods have gained prevalence due to their excellent reconstruction performances, but such success is mainly limited within the same dataset and does not generalize across datasets with different distributions. Hereby we propose ExtraPolationNetwork for limited-angle CT reconstruction via the introduction of a sinogram extrapolation module, which is theoretically justified. The module complements extra sinogram information and boots model generalizability. Extensive experimental results show that our reconstruction model achieves state-of-the-art performance on NIH-AAPM dataset, similar to existing approaches. More importantly, we show that using such a sinogram extrapolation module significantly improves the generalization capability of the model on unseen datasets (e.g., COVID-19 and LIDC datasets) when compared to existing approaches.","Wang, Ce; Zhang, Haimiao; Li, Qian; Shang, Kun; Lyu, Yuanyuan; Dong, Bin; Zhou, S.

This study investigates how public health emergencies, such as COVID-19, affect people's impulsive consumption behavior. Data from 1548 individuals in China during the COVID-19 outbreak was collected. The sample covered 297 prefecture-level cities in 31 provincial administrative regions. The research method included the use of a structural equation model to test multiple research hypotheses. The study finds that the severity of a pandemic positively affects people's impulsive consumption. Specifically, the more severe the pandemic, the more likely people are to make impulsive consumption choices. The results indicate that both perceived control and materialism play mediating roles between the severity of a pandemic and impulsive consumption. As conclusions, people's impulsive consumption during public health emergencies can be weakened either by enhancing their perceived control or by reducing their materialistic tendency. These conclusions are valuable and useful for a government's crisis response and disaster risk management.","Li, Mo; Zhao, Taiyang; Huang, Ershuai; Li, Jianan",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,217

We distinguish two versions: one of them with integer coefficients and the other one with decimal coefficients in the affine function. We observed that the nature of the coefficients impacts the mathematical work used by the students, where we again focus on two of them: by direct estimation from the graph or by calculating the equation of the line. On the other hand, a feedback oriented towards the""estimation""strategy influences the mathematical work used by the students, even though a non-negligible group persists in the""calculating""strategy, which is partly explained by the perception of each of the strategies.","Gaona, Jorge; Hern'andez, Rodrigo; Guevara, Felipe; Bravo, V'ictor",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.11448v2.pdf,217

Delays in routine healthcare and immunization have led to a rise in concerns about resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases around the world. With the release and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, plans to improve immunization rates need to be explored and implemented across disciplines. One approach would be the consideration of perioperative vaccinations; however, the effects of anesthesia and surgery on the immune response and complications associated with vaccination during the perioperative period are still poorly understood, and opinions are divided. To ascertain the value of a perioperative vaccination program, it is important to understand the basics of immunization and common vaccinations; the potential vaccine complications in the pediatric cohort; the implications of anesthesia and surgery on the immune response; and current recommendations. In addition, we believe it is important to discuss the logistics and feasibility of coordinating perioperative immunization should this become a regular opportunity.","Lin, Connie; Vazquez-Colon, Caroll; Geng-Ramos, Giuliana; Challa, Chaitanya",Paediatr. anaesth,,217

For non-severe COVID-19 patients affected by neurovascular diseases, the prevalence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is unknown. The aim of our study was to report data obtained after systematic Doppler ultrasound scanning (DUS) of lower limbs in such patients. Methods: Between March 20 and May 2, 2020, the deep venous system of 13 consecutive patients diagnosed with neurovascular diseases and non-severe COVID-19 was investigated with a systematic bedside DUS. Results: Thirteen patients were enrolled in the study including 9 acute ischaemic strokes, 1 occlusion of the ophthalmic artery, 1 transient ischaemic attack, 1 cerebral venous thrombosis and 1 haemorrhagic stroke. On admission, the median National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was of 6 (IQR, 0–20). During the first week after admission, and despite thromboprophylaxis, we found a prevalence of 38.5% of asymptomatic calves’ DVT (n = 5). One patient developed a symptomatic pulmonary embolism and 2 other patients died during hospitalization. The outcome was positive for the other patients with a discharge median NIHSS score of 1 (IQR, 0–11). Discussion/Conclusion: Despite thromboprophylaxis, systematic bedside DUS showed a high prevalence (38.5%) of asymptomatic DVT in non-severe COVID-19 patients suffering from a neurovascular disease. In the absence of a reliable marker of DVT, we suggest that this non-invasive investigation could be an interesting tool to monitor peripheral venous thrombotic complications in such patients.","Rouyer, Olivier Irène Nora Pierre-Paul Balde Amadou Talibe Jupiter Damaris Bindila Daniela Geny Bernard Wolff Valérie",Cerebrovascular Diseases.

Tethered-swimming and differential pressure sensors allow directly measure propulsive forces. Cross-sectional designs measured peak and mean propulsive force during the front crawl stroke and including men/boys (&#8805;15 years-old) at different competitive levels were mostly reported. Men are more able to show higher propulsive forces than women counterparts. Short- and long-term effects were observed while using dry-land and in-water training programmes. The magnitude of propulsive force is dependent on the type of assessment method, swimming stroke, number of body limbs and gender. While the short-term effects supporting the different training programmes lead to an increase in propulsive force, there is a lack of long-term evidence.","Santos, Catarina C; Marinho, Daniel A; Neiva, Henrique P; Costa, Mário J",Sports Biomech,,217

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has been found at very high concentrations in swab and sputum samples from such individuals. Objective: To estimate the virus levels released from individuals with asymptomatic to moderate COVID-19 into different aerosol sizes by normal breathing and coughing, and to determine what exposure could result from this in a room shared with such individuals. Design, Setting, and Participants: This mathematical modeling study combined the size-distribution of exhaled breath microdroplets for coughing and normal breathing with viral swab and sputum concentrations as approximation for lung lining liquid to obtain an estimate of emitted virus levels. Viral data were obtained from studies published as of May 20, 2020. The resulting emission data fed a single-compartment model of airborne concentrations in a room of 50 m3, the size of a small office or medical examination room. Main Outcomes and Measures: Modeling was used to estimate the viral load emitted by individuals breathing normally or coughing, and the concentrations expected in the simulated room at different ventilation rates. Results: The mean estimated viral load in microdroplets emitted by simulated individuals while breathing regularly was 0.0000049 copies/cm3, with a range of 0.0000000049 to 0.637 copies/cm3. The corresponding estimates for simulated coughing individuals were a mean of 0.277 copies/cm3 per cough, with a range of 0.000277 to 36 030 copies/cm3 per cough. The estimated concentrations in a room with an individual who was coughing frequently were very high, with a maximum of 7.44 million copies/m3 from an individual who was a high emitter. However, regular breathing from an individual who was a high emitter was modeled to result in lower room concentrations of up to 1248 copies/m3. Conclusions and Relevance: In this modeling study, breathing and coughing were estimated to release large numbers of viruses, ranging from thousands to millions of virus copies per cubic meter in a room with an individual with COVID-19 with a high viral load, depending on ventilation and microdroplet formation process. The estimated infectious risk posed by a person with typical viral load who breathes normally was low. The results suggest that only few people with very high viral load pose an infection risk in poorly ventilated closed environments. These findings suggest that strict respiratory protection may be needed when there is a chance to be in the same small room with an individual, whether symptomatic or not, especially for a prolonged period.","Riediker, Michael; Tsai, Dai-Hua",JAMA Netw Open,,217

Recent studies have shown that COVID-19 associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) can present with neurological signs and symptoms. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we have reviewed neurological involvement in these patients. METHODS: A comprehensive electronic literature search was done on PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, Cochrane database, and SCOPUS for the published English language articles from December 1, 2019, to February 28, 2021. A meta-analysis of the proportion was expressed as a pooled proportion with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Representative forest plots showing individual studies and the combined effect size were generated to provide an overview of the results. RESULTS: This systematic review and meta-analysis analyzed 15 published MIS-C studies with a total of 785 patients. Neurological manifestations in patients with MIS-C was found in 27.1%. We found that 27% developed headaches, 17.1% developed meningism/meningitis and 7.6 % developed encephalopathy. Other uncommon neurological manifestations of MIS-C includes anosmia, seizures, cerebellar ataxia, global proximal muscle weakness and bulbar palsy. In MIS-C patients with neurological feature, neuroimaging showed signal changes in the splenium of the corpus callosum. Electroencephalography showed slow wave pattern and nerve conduction studies and electromyography showed mild myopathic and neuropathic changes. CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed that neurological manifestations are not uncommon in patients with MIS-C. Further large prospective studies are needed to better explore the disease spectrum and to unravel the underlying pathophysiology.","Nepal, Gaurav; Shrestha, Gentle Sunder; Rehrig, Jessica Holly; Gajurel, Bikram Prasad; Ojha, Rajeev; Agrawal, Aditi; Panthi, Sandesh; Khatri, Bharat; Adhikari, Ishan",J Nepal Health Res Counc,,217

As experienced in former massive information issues, big data technologies, such as Hadoop, should efficiently tackle the incoming large amounts of data and provide organizations with relevant processed information that was formerly neither visible nor manageable. After having briefly recalled the strategic advantages of big data solutions in the introductory remarks, in the first part of this paper, we focus on the advantages of big data solutions in the currently difficult time of the COVID-19 pandemic. We characterize it as an endemic heterogeneous data context;we then outline the advantages of technologies such as Hadoop and its IT suitability in this context. In the second part, we identify two specific advantages of Hadoop solutions, globality combined with flexibility, and we notice that they are at work with a ""Hadoop Fusion Approach"" that we describe as an optimal response to the context. In the third part, we justify selected qualifications of globality and flexibility by the fact that Hadoop solutions enable comparable returns in opposite contexts of models of partial submodels and of models of final exact systems. In part four, we remark that in both these opposite contexts, Hadoop's solutions allow a large range of needs to be fulfilled, which fits with requirements previously identified as the current heterogeneous data structure of COVID-19 information. In the final part, we propose a framework of strategic data processing conditions.

Since October 2020 the second wave of the pandemic has been observed around the world, as pathogen specific herd immunity has not been built yet. Moreover, the current, more contagious pathogen carrying the D614G mutation has become the globally dominant form of SARS-CoV-2. In this article we present the current state of knowledge on the impact of ACE2 and the reninangiotensin system (RAS) and the innate immune system on different outcomes of COVID-19. Especially, we point out the dual role of the immune system and ACE2 in pathogenesis of the disease. Namely, at the initial stage of the infection anti-viral activity of innate immunity is responsible for inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication. On the other hand, a dysregulated immune response may cause the detrimental hyperinflammation (""cytokine storm"") responsible for the severe course of the disease. Concomitantly, we analyse the roles of ACE2 in both facilitation of infection and abrogation of its effects, as the major cellular entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and an important enzyme responsible for tissue protection, respectively. Finally, we discuss the dominant impact of aging on the fatal outcome of COVID-19.","Marcinkiewicz, J.; Witkowski, J. M.; Olszanecki, R.",Cent Eur J Immunol,,217

We describe a cost-effectiveness framework for evaluating acute treatments for hospitalized patients with COVID-19, considering a broad spectrum of potential treatment profiles and perspectives within the US healthcare system to ensure incorporation of the most relevant clinical parameters, given evidence currently available. METHODS: A lifetime model, with a short-term acute care decision tree followed by a post-discharge three-state Markov cohort model, was developed to estimate the impact of a potential treatment relative to best supportive care (BSC) for patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The model included information on costs and resources across inpatient levels of care, use of mechanical ventilation, post-discharge morbidity from ventilation, and lifetime healthcare and societal costs. Published literature informed clinical and treatment inputs, healthcare resource use, unit costs, and utilities. The potential health impacts and cost-effectiveness outcomes were assessed from US health payer, societal, and fee-for-service (FFS) payment model perspectives. RESULTS: Viewing results in aggregate, treatments that conferred at least a mortality benefit were likely to be cost-effective, as all deterministic and sensitivity analyses results fell far below willingness-to-pay thresholds using both a US health payer and FFS payment perspective, with and without societal costs included. In the base case, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) ranged from $22,933 from a health payer perspective using bundled payments to $8028 from a societal perspective using a FFS payment model. Even with conservative assumptions on societal impact, inclusion of societal costs consistently produced ICERs 40-60% lower than ICERs for the payer perspective. CONCLUSION: Effective COVID-19 treatments for hospitalized patients may not only reduce disease burden but also represent good value for the health system and society. Though data limitations remain, this cost-effectiveness framework expands beyond current models to include societal costs and post-discharge ventilation morbidity effects of potential COVID-19 treatments.","Sheinson, Daniel; Dang, Joseph; Shah, Anuj; Meng, Yang; Elsea, David; Kowal, Stacey",Adv Ther,,217

382534,Cognitive Frailty as a Risk Factor for Incident Disability During Late Life: A 24-Month Follow-Up Longitudinal Study,2020,"Frontline healthcare nurses devoted themselves to deal with the outbreak of COVID-19, saving many lives. However, they are under incredible unknown psychological pressures with a considerable risk of infection. In this study, a self-administered questionnaire was used to survey 593 frontline nurses in Wuhan City and non-Hubei provinces for psychological responses from March 1 to March 10, 2020. Compared with nurses outside Hubei Province, those working in Wuhan were more likely to feel physically and mentally exhausted. Their probable depression and anxiety were significantly higher than those of nurses outside Hubei province (31.2%, 18.3% vs. 13.8%, 5.9%). Correspondingly, the depressive symptoms were more often reported in the Wuhan group (70.8% vs. 41.4%). Although Wuhan received wishes, concerns, and abundant psychological and material resources from all of the world, the survey-based study found that frontline nurses in Wuhan still had higher depression and anxiety with less social support compared with nurses from non-Hubei provinces. Unexpectedly, only 4.0% of nurses have sought psychological assistance. These findings suggested that the short-term psychological impact of frontline nurses in Wuhan during the COVID-19 outbreak was extremely high compared with nurses outside Hubei Province. This research enlightened the efficient integration of psychological resources, the optimization of the nurse emergency psychological assistance system, and the mental health care of medical staff during the outbreak of epidemics.","Ren, Honggang; Luo, Xingguang; Wang, Yincheng; Guo, Xiaoyun; Hou, Huiru; Zhang, Yong; Yang, Pengcheng; Zhu, Fang; Hu, Chao; Wang, Runsheng; Sun, Yu; Du, Yingzhen; Yin, Qin; Xu, Guogang; Zuo, Hui; Hu, Qinyong; Wang, Yahui",Transl Psychiatry,,217
383252,Vitamin D: A Nutrient To Bring To Light During COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: An exceptionally high demand for surgical masks and N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) during the COVID-19 pandemic has considerably exceeded their supply. These disposable devices are generally not approved for routine decontamination and re-use as a standard of care, while this practice has widely occurred in hospitals. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention allowed it ""as a crisis capacity strategy"". However, limited testing was conducted on the impact of specific decontamination methods on the performance of N95 FFRs and no data was presented for surgical masks. AIM: We evaluated common surgical masks and N95 respirators with respect to the changes in their performance and integrity resulting from autoclave sterilization and a 70% ethanol treatment; these methods are frequently utilized for re-used filtering facepieces in hospitals. METHODS: The filter collection efficiency and pressure drop were determined for unused masks and N95 FFRs, and for those subjected to the treatments in a variety of ways. The collection efficiency was measured for particles of approximately 0.037-3.2 µm to represent aerosolized single viruses, their agglomerates, bacteria and larger particle carriers. FINDINGS: The initial collection efficiency and the filter breathability may be compromised by sterilization in an autoclave and ethanol treatment. The effect depends on a protective device, particle size, breathing flow rate, type of treatment and other factors. Additionally, physical damages were observed in N95 respirators after autoclaving. CONCLUSION: Strategies advocating decontamination and re-use of filtering facepieces in hospitals should be re-assessed considering the data obtained in this study.","Grinshpun, S A; Yermakov, M; Khodoun, M",J Hosp Infect,,217

This article presents lessons learned from a preventive intervention project intersected by the COVID-19 crisis that moved from a mix-methods study design to online ethnography. The 'home-officed' research team e-witnessed high-school students' daily lives and collaborated in youths' and community-based organisations' responses in the territories where they study and live. Psychosocial distress increased, also driven by the disastrous governmental response to the health and economic crises. There was growing anxiety about meeting friends and dating, with structural limits for sustaining the recommended social distancing, which added to gender/sexuality-based violence. Simultaneously, we observed students becoming relevant actors through co-producing preventive practices, surpassing risk-group notions and combining SARS-CoV-2 prevention with sexuality, gender, racism and mental-health issues. They managed internet-mediated applications to promote critical thinking and collective actions aimed at health promotion among their peers, from their homes. Freire's concept of 'untested-feasibility' fostered researchers', students' and community leaders' imaginations in the face of this unprecedented crisis, thereby enhancing social responses to the epidemic to become rights-based comprehensive dialogical preventive activities. This ongoing intervention-research stresses how prevention sciences can go beyond reduction of this pandemic to a viral event.","Paiva, Vera; Garcia, Marcos R V; França-Jr, Ivan; da Silva, Cristiane Gonçalves; Galeão-Silva, L G; Simões, Júlio Assis; Ayres, José Ricardo",Glob Public Health,,217

Accumulating evidence suggests that IgA or anti-Fc&#945;RI could also represent an exciting avenue toward novel therapeutic strategies. SUMMARY: Here, we underline that IgA is more effective in recruiting neutrophils for tumor cell killing and is potently active against several pathogens, including rotavirus, poliovirus, influenza virus, and SARS-CoV-2. IgA could also be used to modulate excessive immune responses in inflammatory diseases. Furthermore, secretory IgA is emerging as a major regulator of gut microbiota, which impacts intestinal homeostasis and global health as well. As such, IgA could be used to promote a healthy microbiota in a therapeutic setting. Key messages: IgA combines multifaceted functions that can be desirable for immunotherapy.","Sterlin, Delphine; Gorochov, Guy",Pharmacology,,217

It has implications not only in the public health sector but also in the global economy and political landscape. The prevention strategy that has been followed in Sri Lanka is unique. Early action taken by the government and the ministry of health, being one of pre-emptive quarantining and isolation of suspected contacts even before they developed symptoms, was vital to contain the spread of the disease. During the early phase, a nationwide lockdown in the form of a curfew was imposed which helped mitigate the spread of the virus. However, due to several lapses, there was a threat of community transmission; this was swiftly brought under control through ongoing government interventions. Thus, strict social/physical distancing measures enforced by the government, together with an increase in testing capacity, prevented widespread community transmission. Strictly containing the outbreaks as and when they were identified made it easier to bring the spread under control through contact tracing. In this article, we give an account of the strategy taken by Sri Lanka to mitigate the pandemic and comment on the lessons learned concerning the ethical responses to the COVID-19 crisis.","Hettiarachchi, Dineshani; Noordeen, Nafeesa; Gamakaranage, Chanpika; Somarathne, E A Rumesh Buddhika D; Jayasinghe, Saroj",Asian Bioeth Rev,,217
385839,On how Spanish hospital emergency departments coped with the first wave of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: As one of the most widely researched consequence of traumatic events, the prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptoms among people exposed to the trauma resulting from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak varies greatly across studies. This review aimed at examining the pooled prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptoms among people exposed to the trauma resulting from COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: Systematic searches of databases were conducted for literature published on PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, PsycArticle, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure until October 14, 2020. Statistical analyses were performed using R software (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42020180309). RESULTS: A total of 106,713 people exposed to the trauma resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak were identified in the 76 articles, of which 33,810 were reported with post-traumatic stress symptoms. The pooled prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptoms among people exposed to the trauma resulting from COVID-19 outbreak was 28.34%, with a 95% confidence interval of 23.03-34.32%. Subgroup analysis indicated that older age, male and bigger sample size were associated with higher prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptoms. After controlling for other factors, the results of meta-regression showed that the influence of gender and sample size on prevalence is no longer significant. CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were very common among people exposed to the trauma resulting from COVID-19 outbreak. Further research is needed to explore more possible risk factors for post-traumatic stress symptoms and identify effective strategies for preventing PTSD-related symptoms among people exposed to the trauma resulting from COVID-19 outbreak.","Qiu, Dan; Li, Yilu; Li, Ling; He, Jun; Ouyang, Feiyun; Xiao, Shuiyuan",Eur Psychiatry,,217

The minute-to-minute increasing coronavirus cases (>85 M) and progressive deaths (&#8776;1.8 M) calls for finding a cure to this devastating pandemic. While there have been many attempts to find biologically active molecules targeting SARS-CoV-2 for treatment of this viral infection, none has found a way to the clinic yet. In this study, a 3-feature structure-based pharmacophore model was designed for SARS-CoV-2 main protease (MPro) that plays a vital role in the viral cellular penetration. High throughput virtual screening of the lead-like ZINC library was then performed to find a potent inhibitor employing the predesigned pharmacophore. In-silico pharmacokinetics/toxicity prediction study was subsequently applied towards the best hits. Finally, a 50 ns molecular dynamics simulation was carried out for the best hit and compared to the co-crystallized ligand where the hit compound displayed high binding and comparable interactions. The results identified new hits for SARS-CoV-2 MPro inhibition showing good docking score, pharmacokinetics and toxicity profile, drug-likeness, high binding energy in addition to a promising synthetic accessibility. Identifying new small compounds as potential leads for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 is a very important step towards designing a synthesizing of promising drug candidates.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

386458,Adrenal Insufficiency and Glucocorticoid Use During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, has been rapidly increasing in the United States. Boroughs of New York City, including Queens county, turn out to be the epicenters of this infection. According to the data provided by the New York State Department of Health, most of the cases of new COVID-19 infections in New York City have been found in the Queens county where 42,023 people have tested positive, and 3221 people have died as of 20 April 2020. Person-to-person transmission and travels were implicated in the initial spread of the outbreaks, but factors related to the late phase of rapidly spreading outbreaks in March and April are still uncertain. A few previous studies have explored the links between air pollution and COVID-19 infections, but more data is needed to understand the effects of short-term exposures of air pollutants and meteorological factors on the spread of COVID-19 infections, particularly in the U.S. disease epicenters. In this study, we have focused on ozone and PM2.5, two major air pollutants in New York City, which were previously found to be associated with respiratory viral infections. The aim of our regression modeling was to explore the associations among ozone, PM2.5, daily meteorological variables (wind speed, temperature, relative humidity, absolute humidity, cloud percentages, and precipitation levels), and COVID-19 confirmed new cases and new deaths in Queens county, New York during March and April 2020. The results from these analyses showed that daily average temperature, daily maximum eight-hour ozone concentration, average relative humidity, and cloud percentages were significantly and positively associated with new confirmed cases related to COVID-19; none of these variables showed significant associations with new deaths related to COVID-19. The findings indicate that short-term exposures to ozone and other meteorological factors can influence COVID-19 transmission and initiation of the disease, but disease aggravation and mortality depend on other factors.","Adhikari, Atin; Yin, Jingjing",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,217

Globally, beverage companies alone generate over 200 million tonnes of biomass annually, which largely ends up as animal feed or in landfills. With the UK government's commitment to reduce its carbon footprint by at least 68% in 2030, many companies, especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs), are exploring options to reduce carbon emissions and develop roadmaps to become carbon neutral. It has thus become imperative for beverage companies to find value in or repurpose their waste. This paper unlocks the potential for improving the fuel properties of beverage waste through a blending process and explores the determination of optimal fractions for the blends via characterization. With an initial moisture content of 82 and 58 wt.% brewery spent grain (BSG) and spent coffee grounds (SCG), respectively, the pre-treatment process reduced moisture content by approximately 10-15 wt.%. The study concludes that biomass blending improved the fuel properties of the biomass, providing a competitive comparison with coal for energy applications.","Idowu, I.

This study's objective was to assess the perception of COVID-19 vaccination amongst Colombian physicians featuring two different scenarios of COVID-19 vaccination. Methods: A cross-sectional analytical study was carried out through an online survey directed at medical staff in several cities in Colombia. The percentage of physicians who have a positive perception to be vaccinated and the associated factors that determine that decision were determined. A binomial regression analysis adjusted for age and sex was carried out, taking as a dependent variable the acceptance of free vaccination with an effectiveness of 60 and 80%. The most significant factors were determined in the non-acceptance of vaccination. Results: Between 77.0% and 90.7% of physicians in Colombia accept COVID-19 vaccination, according to the scenario evaluated where the vaccine's effectiveness was 60 or 80%, respectively. Medical specialty, having never paid for a vaccine, recommending the administration of the vaccine to their parents or people over 70 years, and dispensing the vaccine to their children, were the factors to consider to be vaccinated for free with an effectiveness of 60% and 80%. Conclusions: There is a high perception of the intention to vaccinate physicians in Colombia against COVID-19, and this is very similar to that of the general population.","Alvarado-Socarras, Jorge L; Vesga-Varela, Andrea Liliana; Quintero-Lesmes, Doris Cristina; Fama-Pereira, Marcela M; Serrano-Diaz, Norma C; Vasco, Mauricio; Carballo-Zarate, Virgil; Zambrano, Lysien I; Paniz-Mondolfi, Alberto; Rodriguez-Morales, Alfonso J",,,217

We analyzed conserved domains of the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV2] for possible targets of viral entry inhibition in host cells, evolutionary relationship of human coronavirus [229E] and zoonotic coronaviruses with SAR-CoV2 as well as evolutionary relationship between selected SARS-CoV 2 genomic data. Conserved domains with antagonistic action on host innate antiviral cellular mechanisms in SARS-CoV 2 include nsp 11, nsp 13 etc. Also, multiple sequence alignments of the spike [S] gene protein of selected candidate zoonotic coronaviruses alongside the S gene protein of the SARs-CoV2 revealed closest evolutionary relationship [95.6%] with pangolin coronaviruses [S] gene. Clades formed between Wuhan SARS-CoV2 phylogeny data and five others suggests viral entry trajectory while revealing genomic and protein SARS CoV 2 data from Philippines as early ancestors. Therefore, phylogeny of SARS-CoV 2 genomic data suggests profiling in diverse populations with and without the outbreak alongside migration history and racial background for mutation tracking and dating of viral subtype divergence which is essential for effective management of present and future zoonotic coronavirus outbreaks.","Obajuluwa, Adejoke Olukayode; Okiki, Pius Abimbola; Obajuluwa, Tiwalola Madoc; Afolabi, Olakunle Bamikole",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.02809v1.pdf,217

This ongoing pandemic has resulted in the death of millions of people globally. About one and a half thousand people have died due to this illness in Ethiopia. The clinical presentations of the disease vary with geography and populations. We therefore aimed at investigating the clinical characteristics of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in North-East Ethiopia. Methods: real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was conducted for 18,112 individuals suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection during June 27 to October 20, 2020, at Woldia university COVID-19 testing center. Recorded data of 372 Ethiopians who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection at Woldia university COVID-19 testing center were retrospectively extracted and analyzed using SPSS v25.0. A P-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: nearly 2.1% of the screened participants were found positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among them, three fourth of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were male, with an overall median age of 30 years. About 85% of the patients were asymptomatic. The most common clinical manifestations were cough (14.2%), followed by fever (11.0%) and headache (8.6%), whereas hypertension (1.6%), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (1.6%) diabetes mellitus (1.1%), and chronic respiratory diseases (1.1%) were relatively the most common comorbidities noted. The case-fatality ratio was found at 1.6%. Age and underlying comorbidities had a statistically significant association with severity and poor outcome of patients (P < 0.001). Conclusion: the finding from this study indicated that older age and people with underlying comorbidities are at high risk of having the severe disease and poor outcomes. Hence, appropriate care and priority should be given to these people to decrease the morbidity and mortality caused by this illness. The presence of higher asymptomatic infection is the possible indicator of potential asymptomatic transmissions within the community. This highlights the need for widespread testing, and contact tracing to flatten the transmission curve.","Geteneh, Alene; Alemnew, Birhan; Tadesse, Selamyhun; Girma, Abebe",Pan Afr Med J,,217

390912,The psychological impact of COVID-19 among a sample of Italian patients with functional neurological disorders: A preliminary study,2020,"BACKGROUND: Despite 2.5 million infections and 169,000 deaths worldwide (as of April 20, 2020), no maternal deaths and only a few pregnant women afflicted with severe respiratory morbidity have been reported to be related to COVID-19 disease. Given the disproportionate burden of severe and fatal respiratory disease previously documented among pregnant women following other coronavirus-related outbreaks (SARS-CoV in 2003 and MERS-CoV in 2012) and influenza pandemics over the last century, the absence of reported maternal morbidity and mortality with COVID-19 disease is unexpected. OBJECTIVE: To describe maternal and perinatal outcomes and death in a case series of pregnant women with COVID-19 disease. STUDY DESIGN: We describe here a multiinstitution adjudicated case series from Iran that includes 9 pregnant women diagnosed with severe COVID-19 disease in their second or third trimester. All 9 pregnant women received a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction nucleic acid testing. Outcomes of these women were compared with their familial/household members with contact to the affected patient on or after their symptom onset. All data were reported at death or after a minimum of 14 days from date of admission with COVID-19 disease. RESULTS: Among 9 pregnant women with severe COVID-19 disease, at the time of reporting, 7 of 9 died, 1 of 9 remains critically ill and ventilator dependent, and 1 of 9 recovered after prolonged hospitalization. We obtained self-verified familial/household cohort data in all 9 cases, and in each and every instance, maternal outcomes were more severe compared with outcomes of other high- and low-risk familial/household members (n=33 members for comparison). CONCLUSION: We report herein maternal deaths owing to COVID-19 disease. Until rigorously collected surveillance data emerge, it is prudent to be aware of the potential for maternal death among pregnant women diagnosed as having COVID-19 disease in their second or third trimester.","Hantoushzadeh, Sedigheh; Shamshirsaz, Alireza A; Aleyasin, Ashraf; Seferovic, Maxim D; Aski, Soudabeh Kazemi; Arian, Sara E; Pooransari, Parichehr; Ghotbizadeh, Fahimeh; Aalipour, Soroush; Soleimani, Zahra; Naemi, Mahsa; Molaei, Behnaz; Ahangari, Roghaye; Salehi, Mohammadreza; Oskoei, Atousa Dabiri; Pirozan, Parisa; Darkhaneh, Roya Faraji; Laki, Mahboobeh Gharib; Farani, Ali Karimi; Atrak, Shahla; Miri, Mir Mohammad; Kouchek, Mehran; Shojaei, Seyedpouzhia; Hadavand, Fahimeh; Keikha, Fatemeh; Hosseini, Maryam Sadat; Borna, Sedigheh; Ariana, Shideh; Shariat, Mamak; Fatemi, Alireza; Nouri, Behnaz; Nekooghadam, Seyed Mojtaba; Aagaard, Kjersti",Am J Obstet Gynecol,,217

However, only few patients proved positivity for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The relationship between this skin manifestation and COVID-19 infection has not been clarified yet. OBJECTIVE: To thoroughly characterize a prospective group of patients with chilblain-like lesions and to investigate the possible relationship with SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: Following informed consent, patients underwent (i) clinical evaluation, (ii) RT-PCR and serology testing for SARS-CoV-2, (iii) digital videocapillaroscopy of finger and toe nailfolds, (iv) blood testing to screen for autoimmune diseases and coagulation anomalies, and (v) skin biopsy for histopathology, direct immunofluorescence and, in selected cases, electron microscopy. RESULTS: Nineteen patients, all adolescents (mean age: 14 years), were recruited. 11/19 (58%) of them and/or their cohabitants reported flu-like symptoms one to two months prior to skin manifestation onset. Lesions were localized to toes and also heels and soles. Videocapillaroscopy showed pericapillary oedema, dilated and abnormal capillaries, and microhaemorrhages both in finger and toe in the majority of patients. Major pathological findings included epidermal basal layer vacuolation, papillary dermis oedema and erythrocyte extravasation, perivascular and perieccrine dermal lymphocytic infiltrate, and mucin deposition in the dermis and hypodermis; dermal vessel thrombi were observed in two cases. Blood examinations were normal. Nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 and IgG serology for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein were negative. Importantly, IgA serology for S1 domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was positive in 6 patients and borderline in 3. CONCLUSIONS: Chilblain-like lesions during COVID-19 pandemic have specific epidemiologic, clinical, capillaroscopic and histopathological characteristics, which distinguish them from idiopathic perniosis. Though we could not formally prove SARS-CoV-2 infection in our patients, history data and the detection of anti-SARS-COV-2 IgA strongly suggest a relationship between skin lesions and COVID-19. Further investigations on the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and pathogenesis of chilblain-like lesions are warranted.","El Hachem, M; Diociaiuti, A; Concato, C; Carsetti, R; Carnevale, C; Ciofi Degli Atti, M; Giovannelli, L; Latella, E; Porzio, O; Rossi, S; Stracuzzi, A; Zaffina, S; Onetti Muda, A; Zambruno, G; Alaggio, R",J.

392573,A double-edged sword-telemedicine for maternal care during COVID-19: findings from a global mixed-methods study of healthcare providers,2021,"Pathogens pose a major risk to wild host populations, especially in the face of ongoing biodiversity declines. Beak and feather disease virus (BFDV) can affect most if not all members of one of the largest and most threatened bird orders world-wide, the Psittaciformes. Signs of disease can be severe and mortality rates high. Its broad host range makes it a risk to threatened species in particular, because infection can occur via spill-over from abundant hosts. Despite these risks, surveillance of BFDV in locally abundant wild host species has been lacking. We used qPCR and haemagglutination assays to investigate BFDV prevalence, load and shedding in seven abundant host species in the wild in south-east Australia: Crimson Rosellas (Platycercus elegans), Eastern Rosellas (Platycercus eximius), Galahs (Eolophus roseicapillus), Sulphur-crested Cockatoos (Cacatua galerita), Blue-winged Parrots (Neophema chrysostoma), Rainbow Lorikeets (Trichoglossus moluccanus) and Red-rumped Parrots (Psephotus haematonotus). We found BFDV infection in clinically normal birds in six of the seven species sampled. We focused our analysis on the four most commonly caught species, namely Crimson Rosellas (BFDV prevalence in blood samples: 41.8%), Sulphur-crested Cockatoos (20.0%), Blue-winged Parrots (11.8%) and Galahs (8.8%). Species, but not sex, was a significant predictor for BFDV prevalence and load. 56.1% of BFDV positive individuals were excreting BFDV antigen into their feathers, indicative of active viral replication with shedding. Being BFDV positive in blood samples predicted shedding in Crimson Rosellas. Our study confirms that BFDV is endemic in our study region, and can inform targeted disease management by providing comparative data on interspecies variation in virus prevalence, load and shedding.","Martens, Johanne M; Stokes, Helena S; Berg, Mathew L; Walder, Ken; Raidal, Shane R; Magrath, Michael J L; Bennett, Andy T D",PLoS One,,217
392824,Outcomes of patients with chronic plaque psoriasis and hidradenitis suppurativa on biologic therapy during the Covid-19 pandemic: A UK dermatology tertiary centre experience,2021,"During the pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, pharmacy services have had to adapt their service portfolio, and yet ensure efficient, equitable and quality pharmaceutical care. Given the limited scientific evidence available, most drugs have been used off-label or in the context of clinical trials, which should be the preferred option in order to create new evidence. Among kind different situations we have faced are the increase in workload, the expansion of coverage to new wards and ICUs and shortages, which have caused the use of alternative drugs and even other routes of administration. Given that covid-19 affects elderly population with greater severity and many of them are polymedicated, great effort have been focused on monitoring interactions, both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (specially prolongation of the QT interval), monitoring correct concentrations of electrolytes, nutritional support, adaptation of chemotherapy treatment protocols and anticoagulant management, among others. The use of personal protective equipment added difficulty for nursing work and some measures had been taken to minimize the number of entries into the rooms. Eventually, team's split to guarantee care, the challenge of teleworking, remote validation, telemedicine and telepharmacy for communication between professionals and patients, as well as training in this pandemic situation have been a challenge for our profession. These difficulties have risen up new learning opportunities we hope will be useful to us in the event we have to face similar situations in the future.","Sevilla-Sánchez, Daniel; Tuset-Creus, Montse",Farm Hosp,,217

Aims To outline the prevalence and dynamic changing features of medical workers' psychological issues and to review the related national policies during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Methods We systematically searched for studies on the psychological states of Chinese medical staff from 1 January 2020 to 8 May 2020. The aggregate prevalence of each psychological issue was calculated and plotted to observe the changes over time. Policies on psychological support for medical staff during the pandemic were reviewed to explore their link to the prevalence of psychological problems. Results In total, 26 studies were included in this study. A total of 22 062 medical workers were surveyed from 31 January to 27 February 2020. Medical staff exhibited a substantial prevalence of anxiety symptoms, depression symptoms, stress-related symptoms and sleep problems during the survey period, with aggregate prevalence rates of 27.0%, 26.2%, 42.1% and 34.5%, respectively. Cumulative meta-analyses revealed that the prevalence of psychological distress peaked at the beginning of the pandemic and subsequently exhibited a slow downward trend. Conclusion Chinese medical staff displayed significant psychological disturbance during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, which was especially severe at the early stage. Implementing supportive policies may help alleviate ongoing psychological problems in healthcare workers. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

This highly contagious communicable disease has put not only infected individuals but other patients and frontline workers like nurses at risk in hospitals, especially in Intensive Care units (ICUs). There is a need for minimizing patient contact, improving hand hygiene practices, and optimizing healthcare provider time, especially nurses. Globally it is estimated that nearly a million health care providers have been infected with COVID-19 as of the end of October 2020. METHODS: This retrospective service evaluation documents the experience of health care providers in a COVID-19 ICU in India that was used to implement new protocols for secretion management and oral hygiene. Patient chart information and staff feedback were utilized. INTERVENTION: This pilot study captures the practical benefits of using VAPCare, an automated, closed-loop system for oral secretion removal. RESULTS: Six patients were included in this small-scale study; three patients following the current standard of care for suctioning and oral hygiene and three receiving the new VAPCare and Lumen device protocol. With the new device protocol, the number of infected secretion interactions by a nurse was 50% lower, and nursing time spent on oral hygiene and secretion management 70% less than seen with the current standard of care. The number of disposable gloves used with VAPCare and Lumen was reduced by over 50%. All 10 nurses and six doctors gave positive feedback on device usage. The department recommended updating protocols to prioritize the use of the new secretion management system for patients with COVID19 and other highly contagious conditions. CONCLUSION: The findings are an early indication that using VAPCare for patients could help protect infected patients, other ICU patients, and health care workers.","Saseedharan, Sanjith; Karanam, Roopa; Kadam, Vaijayanti; Shirsekar, Suvarna",Nurs. crit. care,,217

METHODS: This cohort study was conducted at University Hospital, which is a designated hospital for COVID-19 patients. Adult patients who were admitted to our hospital emergency department with suspected COVID-19 and who were hospitalized in our institution with a COVID-19 diagnosis were analysed. RESULTS: There were 148 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. All-cause mortality of follow-up was 12.8%. There were statistically significant results between the two groups (survivors and nonsurvivors), which were classified based on hospital mortality rates, in terms of the lymphocyte to C-reactive protein ratio (LCRP), systemic immune inflammation index (SII), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), CRP concentration and comorbid disease. In a receiver operating characteristic (ROC), curve analysis, LCRP, NLR, PLR and SII area under the curve (AUC) for in-hospital mortality were 0.817, 0.816, 0.733 and 0.742, respectively. Based on an LCRP value of 1 for in-hospital mortality, the sensitivity and specificity rates were 100% and 86.8%, respectively. Based on the average SII of 2699 for in-hospital mortality, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy rates were 68.4%, 77.5% and 76.3%, respectively.

396303,Analysing the variation in volume and nature of trauma presentations during COVID-19 lockdown in Ireland,2020,"Despite rigorous global containment and quarantine efforts, the incidence of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known as COVID-19, continues to surge, with more than 12 million laboratory-confirmed cases and over 500,000 deaths worldwide (as of 11 July 2020). Aside from the continued surge in cases and the imperatives of public health concern and saving lives, economic devastation is also mounting with a global depression now seeming inevitable. There is limited attention directed towards people who have recovered from the virus and whether this metric can be useful in guiding when the economy can be re-opened. In this paper, a simpler model is presented in order to guide various countries on the (possible) re-opening of the economy (or re-opening in stages/phases) alongside risk categories and ratios. Factors that need to be considered when applying the model include the healthcare capacity in terms of the number of hospitals, beds and healthcare workers that are available to capacitate this virus. In addition, population size, physical distancing measures, socio-economic disparities, lockdown regulations in each country, and more importantly - the amount and accuracy of testing conducted, is also imperative to consider. Decisions adopted by leaders around the world have the most difficult decision to make (yet), and have to weigh up on what really matters; health or wealth. It is suggested that this model be applied in a number of states/counties and countries in order to gauge the risk of their location being re-opened, by observing their total number of recoveries in proximity to total number of cases.","Noorbhai, Habib",Ann.

396399,Challenges of COVID-19 case detection in a resource-limited primary care setting: A commentary,2020,"A new type of coronavirus named as SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has begun to threaten human health. As with other types of coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 affects children less frequently, and it has been observed that the disease is mild. In the pathogenesis of a standard viral infection, the pathogen's contact with the mucosa is initially followed by an innate immunity response. T cells are the primary decisive element in adaptive immunity capability. For this reason, the adaptive immune response mediated by the thymus is a process that regulates the immune response responsible for preventing invasive damage from a virus. Regulatory T cells (T-reg) are active during the early periods of life and have precise roles in immunomodulation. The thymus is highly active in the intrauterine and neonatal period; it begins to shrink after birth and continues its activity until adolescence. The loss of T-reg function by age results in difficulty with the control of the immune response, increased inflammation as shown in coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as an inflammatory storm. Also, the thymus is typically able to replace the T cells destroyed by apoptosis caused by the virus. Thymus and T cells are the key factors of pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 in children.Conclusion: We speculated that thymus activity and T lymphocyte function in children protect them against the virus effects. Stimulating and preventing the inhibition of the thymus can be possible treatment components against COVID-19. What is Known: â¢ The SARS-CoV-2 infection does not often progress with an invasive clinic in children. â¢ Thymus activity and T lymphocyte functions are highly active in children. What is New: â¢ Effective thymus activity and T lymphocyte function in children protect them against the invasive SARS-CoV-2 infection. â¢ Stimulating and preventing the inhibition of the thymus can be possible treatment components against COVID-19.","Günes, Hatice; Dinçer, Serpil; Acipayam, Can; Yurttutan, Sadik; Özkars, Mehmet Yasar",Eur. j. pediatr,,217

The research investigation concerned finding an answer to the question: to what extent did consumer eating behavior change during the pandemic, and how did the risk of becoming overweight and obesity increase? Design/Methodology/Approach: To gain deeper insight into consumer eating behavior amid the Covid-19 outbreak, a survey on food choice and cooking attitudes was carried out in the West Pomeranian region of Poland. Four hundred twenty respondents took part in the survey. The data obtained was used to elaborate a multi-agent model created by the author and the execution of simulation experiments. A multi-agent-based modeling and simulation (MABS) method was used to build the model. Findings: The research shows that among the individuals participating in the study, three types of eating attitudes were distinguished, restrained eaters (41.9%), emotional eaters (34.8%), and external eaters (23.3%). These three groups reported different behavior, highlighting, for example, an increase in ready-made and ultra-processed food consumption within the non-emotionally responsive group. Empirical data was used to develop an agent-based simulation model that combined different eating styles represented by consumers with their food and cooking habits to simulate consumer behavior during the Covid-19 epidemic.

The programme is implemented across 13 countries by a consortium of four leading international development partners: Sightsavers, Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, Schistosomiasis Control Initiative Foundation and Mott Macdonald. This paper presents messages learnt from country assessments that took place prior to the global outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). These messages remain relevant post-COVID-19, with greater priority being given to the challenges for national NTD programmes in continuing to deliver mass drug administration (MDA) during the pandemic. Stakeholder coordination from the earliest stages of the pandemic has occurred at two levels: in the first mile with global partners of the NTD Supply Chain Forum and in the last mile with implementing partners in each country. This has been instrumental to manage delayed MDA, including the impact delays have on the shipment of NTD donated drugs and the distribution of stock held in country. The Ascend West and Central Africa programme is supporting countries with the resumption of MDA through a risk assessment and mitigation action (RAMA) process.","Villacorta Linaza, Rocio; Garner, Timothy; Genovezos, Chantelle",Trans.

How the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome is folded in the virion remains unknown. To fill the knowledge gap and facilitate structure-based drug development, we develop a virion RNA in situ conformation sequencing technology, named vRIC-seq, for probing viral RNA genome structure unbiasedly. Using vRIC-seq data, we reconstruct the tertiary structure of the SARS-CoV-2 genome and reveal a surprisingly ""unentangled globule"" conformation. We uncover many long-range duplexes and higher-order junctions, both of which are under purifying selections and contribute to the sequential package of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Unexpectedly, the D614G and the other two accompanying mutations may remodel duplexes into more stable forms. Lastly, the structure-guided design of potent small interfering RNAs can obliterate the SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells. Overall, our work provides a framework for studying the genome structure, function, and dynamics of emerging deadly RNA viruses.","Cao, Changchang; Cai, Zhaokui; Xiao, Xia; Rao, Jian; Chen, Juan; Hu, Naijing; Yang, Minnan; Xing, Xiaorui; Wang, Yongle; Li, Manman; Zhou, Bing; Wang, Xiangxi; Wang, Jianwei; Xue, Yuanchao",Nat Commun,,217
401533,Perinatal and postpartum care during the COVID-19 pandemic: a nationwide cohort study,2021,"Preliminary data suggest that cigarette smokers could have an increased mortality risk from the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), and that certain factors (e.g., increased age, medical comorbidities) can also increase risk of poor coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outcomes. Between April 30th, 2020 and May 28th, 2020, we evaluated self-reported changes in recent smoking patterns and motivation to quit smoking among current daily cigarette smokers (N = 103) on Amazon Mechanical Turk. We also assessed the relationship of these outcomes to age, medical comorbidity status, and fear of COVID-19. Most participants (68.9%) reported smoking less frequently than usual in the last 28 days. Among daily smokers, increased fear of COVID-19 predicted increased motivation to quit smoking and actual smoking reductions (ps < .05). Endorsement of one or more medical comorbidities, but not increased age, predicted increased motivation to quit smoking (p < .05). These data suggest the potentially greater relevance of psychological factors (e.g., fear of COVID-19) over external risk factors (e.g., medical comorbidity, increased age) on motivation to quit smoking and actual reductions in smoking patterns, and may reflect that the pandemic is a suitable time for offering smoking cessation intervention.","Gold, Alexandra K; Hoyt, Danielle L; Milligan, Megan; Hiserodt, Michele L; Samora, Jake; Leyro, Teresa M; Zvolensky, Michael J; Otto, Michael W",Cogn Behav Ther,,217

Lung ultrasound is able to depict typical pulmonary findings of COVID-19 and is therefore suitable for diagnosis and follow-up of these patients. CLINICAL/METHODOLOGICAL ISSUE: Lung ultrasound in COVID-19 patients in the emergency room and intensive care unit. STANDARD RADIOLOGICAL METHODS: Computed tomography (low-dose CT) and X­ray of the lung. METHODOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS: Lung ultrasound in COVID-19 patients. RECOMMENDATIONS: Lung ultrasound in patients with COVID-19 offers similar performance as CT and is superior when compared to X­ray in evaluating pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Lung ultrasound plays an important role in the emergency room and intensive care unit. POCUS reduces exposure to radiation, therapy delays, and minimizes transport of high-risk patients. Differential diagnoses can also be clarified.","Schmid, M; Escher, F; Clevert, D-A",,,217

403166,The role of real-time interactive video consultations in dental practice during the recovery and restoration phase of the COVID-19 outbreak,2020,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: Emergency medical services (EMS) may serve as a key source of real-time data about the evolving health of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-affected populations, especially in low- and middle-income countries with less rapid and reliable vital statistics registration systems. Although official COVID-19 statistics in Mexico report almost exclusively inhospital mortality events, excess out-of-hospital mortality has been identified in other countries, including 1 EMS study in Italy that showed a 58% increase. Additionally, EMS and hospital reports from several countries have suggested that silent hypoxemia-low Spo2 in the absence of dyspnea-is associated with COVID-19. It is unclear, however, how these phenomena can be generalized to low- and middle-income countries. We assess how EMS data can be used in a sentinel capacity in Tijuana, a city on the Mexico-United States border with earlier exposure to COVID-19 than many low- and middle-income country settings. METHODS: In this observational study, we calculated numbers of weekly out-of-hospital deaths and respiratory cases handled by EMS in Tijuana, and estimated the difference between peak epidemic rates and expected trends based on data from 2014 to 2019. Results were compared with official COVID-19 statistics, stratified by neighborhood socioeconomic status, and examined for changing demographic or clinical features, including mean Spo2. RESULTS: An estimated 194.7 excess out-of-hospital deaths (95% confidence interval 135.5 to 253.9 deaths) occurred during the peak window (April 14 to May 11), representing an increase of 145% (95% CI 70% to 338%) compared with expected levels. During the same window, only 5 COVID-19-related out-of-hospital deaths were reported in official statistics. This corresponded with an increase in respiratory cases of 236.5% (95% CI 100.7% to 940.0%) and a decrease in mean Spo2 to 77.7% from 90.2% at baseline. The highest out-of-hospital death rates were observed in low-socioeconomic-status areas, although respiratory cases were more concentrated in high-socioeconomic-status areas. CONCLUSION: EMS systems may play an important sentinel role in monitoring excess out-of-hospital mortality and other trends during the COVID-19 crisis in low- and middle-income countries. Using EMS data, we observed increases in out-of-hospital deaths in Tijuana that were nearly 3-fold greater than increases reported in EMS data in Italy. Increased testing in out-of-hospital settings may be required to determine whether excess mortality is being driven by COVID-19 infection, health system saturation, or patient avoidance of health care. We also found evidence of worsening rates of hypoxemia among respiratory patients treated by EMS, suggesting a possible increase in silent hypoxemia, which should be met with increased detection and clinical management efforts. Finally, we observed social disparities in out-of-hospital death that warrant monitoring and amelioration.","Friedman, Joseph; Calderón-Villarreal, Alhelí; Bojorquez, Ietza; Vera Hernández, Carlos; Schriger, David L; Tovar Hirashima, Eva",Ann Emerg Med,,217
403751,Using the Kano Model Survey for Quality of Life Improvement in the Long-Term Care Setting During COVID-19,2021,"Electronic Health Record (EHR) data has been of tremendous utility in Artificial Intelligence (AI) for healthcare such as predicting future clinical events. These tasks, however, often come with many challenges when using classical machine learning models due to a myriad of factors including class imbalance and data heterogeneity (i.e., the complex intra-class variances). To address some of these research gaps, this paper leverages the exciting contrastive learning framework and proposes a novel contrastive regularized clinical classification model. The contrastive loss is found to substantially augment EHR-based prediction: it effectively characterizes the similar/dissimilar patterns (by its""push-and-pull""form), meanwhile mitigating the highly skewed class distribution by learning more balanced feature spaces (as also echoed by recent findings). In particular, when naively exporting the contrastive learning to the EHR data, one hurdle is in generating positive samples, since EHR data is not as amendable to data augmentation as image data. To this end, we have introduced two unique positive sampling strategies specifically tailored for EHR data: a feature-based positive sampling that exploits the feature space neighborhood structure to reinforce the feature learning; and an attribute-based positive sampling that incorporates pre-generated patient similarity metrics to define the sample proximity. Both sampling approaches are designed with an awareness of unique high intra-class variance in EHR data. Our overall framework yields highly competitive experimental results in predicting the mortality risk on real-world COVID-19 EHR data with a total of 5,712 patients admitted to a large, urban health system. Specifically, our method reaches a high AUROC prediction score of 0.959, which outperforms other baselines and alternatives: cross-entropy(0.873) and focal loss(0.931).","Wanyan, Tingyi; Zhang, Jing; Ding, Ying; Azad, Ariful; Wang, Zhangyang; Glicksberg, Benjamin S",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.02932v1.pdf,217
403971,Frailty and comorbidity in predicting community COVID-19 mortality in the U.K. Biobank: The effect of sampling,2021,"PURPOSE: During radiotherapy the peritumoral tissues are daily exposed to subtherapeutic doses of ionizing radiation. Herein, the biological and molecular effects of doses lower than 0.8â¯Gy per fraction (LDIR), previously described as angiogenesis inducers, were assessed in human peritumoral tissues. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Paired biopsies of preperitoneal adipose tissue were surgically collected from 16 patients diagnosed with locally advanced rectal cancer who underwent neo-adjuvant radiotherapy. One of the biopsies is located in the vicinity of the region where the tumor received the prescribed dose of radiation, and thus exposed to LDIR; the other specimen, outside all beam apertures, was used as an internal calibrator (IC). Microvessel density (MDV) was quantified by immunohistochemistry and the expression of angiogenic, pro-inflammatory, adhesion and oxidative stress genes was assessed by quantitative RT-PCR using exclusively endothelial cells (ECs) isolated by laser capture microdissection microscopy. RESULTS: LDIR activated peritumoral ECs by significantly up-regulating the expression of several pro-angiogenic genes such as VEGFR1, VEGFR2, ANGPT2, TGFB2, VWF, FGF2, HGF and PDGFC and down-regulating the pro-inflammatory IL8 marker. Accordingly, the MVD was significantly increased in peritumoral tissues exposed to LDIR, compared to the IC. The patients that yielded a larger pro-angiogenic response, also showed the highest MVD. CONCLUSIONS: LDIR activate ECs in peritumoral tissues that are associated with increased MVD. Although the technological advances in radiotherapy have contributed to reduce the damage to healthy tissues over the past years, the anatomical regions receiving LDIR should be taken into account in the treatment plan report for patient follow-up and in future studies to correlate these doses with tumor dissemination.","Gil Marques, Filipa; Poli, Esmeralda; Malaquias, João; Carvalho, Tânia; Portêlo, Ana; Ramires, Afonso; Aldeia, Fernando; Ribeiro, Ruy Miguel; Vitorino, Emília; Diegues, Isabel; Costa, Luís; Coutinho, João; Pina, Filomena; Mareel, Marc; Constantino Rosa Santos, Susana",Radiother. oncol,,217

405495,New Issues in Nursing Management During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Italy,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Pregnant women are reported to be at increased risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to underlying immunosuppression during pregnancy. However, the clinical course of COVID-19 in pregnancy and risk of vertical and horizontal transmission remain relatively unknown. We aim to describe and evaluate outcomes in pregnant women with COVID-19 in Singapore. METHODS: Prospective observational study of 16 pregnant patients admitted for COVID-19 to 4 tertiary hospitals in Singapore. Outcomes included severe disease, pregnancy loss, and vertical and horizontal transmission. RESULTS: Of the 16 patients, 37.5%, 43.8% and 18.7% were infected in the first, second and third trimesters, respectively. Two gravidas aged &#8805;35 years (12.5%) developed severe pneumonia; one patient (body mass index 32.9kg/m2) required transfer to intensive care. The median duration of acute infection was 19 days; one patient remained reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive >11 weeks from diagnosis. There were no maternal mortalities. Five pregnancies produced term live-births while 2 spontaneous miscarriages occurred at 11 and 23 weeks. RT-PCR of breast milk and maternal and neonatal samples taken at birth were negative; placenta and cord histology showed non-specific inflammation; and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific immunoglobulins were elevated in paired maternal and umbilical cord blood (n=5). CONCLUSION: The majority of COVID-19 infected pregnant women had mild disease and only 2 women with risk factors (obesity, older age) had severe infection; this represents a slightly higher incidence than observed in age-matched non-pregnant women. Among the women who delivered, there was no definitive evidence of mother-to-child transmission via breast milk or placenta.","Mattar, Citra Nz; Kalimuddin, Shirin; Sadarangani, Sapna P; Tagore, Shephali; Thain, Serene; Thoon, Koh Cheng; Hong, Eliane Y; Kanneganti, Abhiram; Ku, Chee Wai; Chan, Grace Mf; Lee, Kelvin Zx; Yap, Jeannie Jy; Tan, Shaun S; Yan, Benedict; Young, Barnaby E; Lye, David C; Anderson, Danielle E; Yang, Liying; Su, Lin Lin; Somani, Jyoti; Tan, Lay Kok; Choolani, Mahesh A; Chan, Jerry Ky",Ann Acad Med Singap,,217

406579,Dermatology's Management of Flagship Diseases in Older Adults: Lifting the Blindfold,2020,"Intravitreal injections (IVI) of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents have become the most prevalent intraocular procedure as they represent the major therapeutic modality for prevalent retinal conditions such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic retinopathy. Effective therapy requires adherence to a schedule of iterative IVI as well as routine clinic appointments. The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in the reduction of attendance at scheduled clinic visits and IVI. In this study, we attempted to analyze the effect of COVID-19 on compliance with anti-VEGF therapy. A total of 636 eyes received injections during a 4-week period of the COVID-19 outbreak in the Retina Clinic. The number of clinic visits for IVI during 1 month from March 15 to April 14 of 2020 was compared to a similar time period in each of the last 4 years. The study demonstrates a decrease in clinic visits for IVI when compared with the same 4-week interval in the four previous years. Based on the trend of the previous 4 years, 10.2% of the year's total was expected for this time period. Using this model, the 636 reported number of injections for the March-April 2020 period was ~ 5%. This represents a decrease of ~ 50% of the expected IVI for this time period.

407257,Return to play after COVID-19: a sport cardiologist's view,2020,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly worldwide from Wuhan. An easy-to-use index capable of the early identification of inpatients who are at risk of becoming critically ill is urgently needed in clinical practice. Hence, the aim of this study was to explore an easy-to-use nomogram and a model to triage patients into risk categories to determine the likelihood of developing a critical illness. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted. We extracted data from 84 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from one designated hospital. The primary endpoint was the development of severe/critical illness within 7 days after admission. Predictive factors of this endpoint were selected by LASSO Cox regression model. A nomogram was developed based on selected variables. The predictive performance of the derived nomogram was evaluated by calibration curves and decision curves. Additionally, the predictive performances of individual and combined variables under study were evaluated by receiver operating characteristic curves. The developed model was also tested in a separate validation set with 71 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients. Results: None of the 84 inpatients were lost to follow-up in this retrospective study. The primary endpoint occurred in 23 inpatients (27.4%). The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were selected as the final prognostic factors. A nomogram was developed based on the NLR and CRP. The calibration curve and decision curve indicated that the constructed nomogram model was clinically useful. The AUCs for the NLR, CRP and Combined Index in both training set and validation sets were 0.685 (95% CI: 0.574-0.783), 0.764 (95% CI: 0.659-0.850), 0.804 (95% CI: 0.702-0.883), and 0.881 (95% CI: 0.782-0.946), respectively. Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that the nomogram and Combined Index calculated from the NLR and CRP are potential and reliable predictors of COVID-19 prognosis and can triage patients at the time of admission.","Liu, Yue-Ping; Li, Gao-Ming; He, Jun; Liu, Ying; Li, Min; Zhang, Rui; Li, Ya-Lan; Wu, Ya-Zhou; Diao, Bo",Ann.

In the present study, viral interference between two capripox viruses (sheeppox SPPV and lumpy skin disease virus LSDV in cattle) with Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) was investigated in vitro and in their natural hosts, sheep and cattle. A combination of SPPV/RVFV and LSDV/RVFV was used to co-infect susceptible cells and animals to detect potential competition. In-vitro interference was evaluated by estimating viral infectivity and copies of viral RNA by a qPCR during three serial passages in cell cultures, whereas in-vivo interference was assessed through antibody responses to vaccination. When lamb testis primary cells were infected with the mixture of capripox and RVFV, the replication of both SPPV and LSDV was inhibited by RVFV. In animals, SPPV/RVFV or LSDV/RVFV combinations inhibited the replication SPPV and LSDV and the antibody response following vaccination. The combined SPPV/RVFV did not protect sheep after challenging with the virulent strain of SPPV and the LSDV/RVFV did not induce interferon Gamma to LSDV, while immunological response to RVFV remain unaffected. Our goal was to assess this interference response to RVFV/capripoxviruses' coinfection in order to develop effective combined live-attenuated vaccines as a control strategy for RVF and SPP/LSD diseases. Our findings indicated that this approach was not suitable for developing a combined SPPV/LSDV/RVFV vaccine candidate because of interference of replication and the immune response among these viruses.","Safini, N; Bamouh, Z; Hamdi, J; Jazouli, M; Tadlaoui, K O; El Harrak, M",Sci Rep,,217
407820,"Correction to the article ""Excess Mortality Estimation During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Preliminary Data from Portugal"", published on Acta Med Port 2020 Jun;33(6):376-383",2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 continues to threaten human life worldwide. We explored how human behaviours have been influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong, and how the transmission of other respiratory diseases (e.g. influenza) has been influenced by human behaviour. METHODS: We focused on the spread of COVID-19 and influenza infections based on reported COVID-19 cases and influenza surveillance data, and investigated the changes in human behaviour due to COVID-19 based on mass transit railway data and the data from a telephone survey. We did the simulation based on SEIR model to assess the risk reduction of influenza transmission caused by the changes in human behaviour. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of passengers fell by 52.0% compared with the same period in 2019. Residents spent 32.2% more time at home. Each person on average came into close contact with 17.6 and 7.1 people per day during the normal and pandemic periods, respectively. Students, workers, and older people reduced their daily number of close contacts by 83.0%, 48.1%, and 40.3%, respectively. The close contact rates in residences, workplaces, places of study, restaurants, shopping centres, markets, and public transport decreased by 8.3%, 30.8%, 66.0%, 38.5%, 48.6%, 41.0%, and 36.1%, respectively. Based on the simulation, these changes in human behaviours reduced the effective reproduction number of influenza by 63.1%. CONCLUSIONS: Human behaviours were significantly influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong. Close contact control contributed more than 47% to the reduction in infection risk of COVID-19.","Zhang, Nan; Jia, Wei; Lei, Hao; Wang, Peihua; Zhao, Pengcheng; Guo, Yong; Dung, Chung-Hin; Bu, Zhongming; Xue, Peng; Xie, Jingchao; Zhang, Yingping; Cheng, Reynold; Li, Yuguo",Clin. infect. dis,,217

In this work, we propose QMO, a generic query-based molecule optimization framework that exploits latent embeddings from a molecule autoencoder. QMO improves the desired properties of an input molecule based on efficient queries, guided by a set of molecular property predictions and evaluation metrics. We show that QMO outperforms existing methods in the benchmark tasks of optimizing molecules for drug likeliness and solubility under similarity constraints. We also demonstrate significant property improvement using QMO on two new and challenging tasks that are also important in real-world discovery problems: (i) optimizing existing SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease inhibitors toward higher binding affinity; and (ii) improving known antimicrobial peptides towards lower toxicity. Results from QMO show high consistency with external validations, suggesting effective means of facilitating molecule optimization problems with design constraints.","Hoffman, Samuel; Chenthamarakshan, Vijil; Wadhawan, Kahini; Chen, Pin-Yu; Das, Payel",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.01921v1.pdf,217
408628,COVID-19 transmission risk and protective protocols in dentistry: a systematic review,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the various psychosocial factors associated with reverse migration among migrant workers during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown in India. METHODS: A cross-sectional multicenter study was conducted at 4 sites in Northwest India. The migrant workers were recruited from various shelter homes, and information was gathered from reverse migrant workers and controls using various tools including a sociodemographic profile; knowledge, attitudes, and practices questionnaire; and reasons for migration and reverse migration questionnaires. A total of 275 reverse migrant workers and 276 controls participated in the study. RESULTS: There was a considerable difference between reverse migrant workers and controls regarding the question of whether it was safe to travel during lockdown (76.0% vs 26.4%, respectively). The most common route of spread of COVID-19 infection was through touching and sneezing, and symptoms were fever, dry cough, and sore throat in both groups. Reverse migrant workers had low self-esteem and were reluctant to participate in customs of their migration city. A large number of reverse migrant workers reported that they had no money to survive, worried about family back home at their village, felt pressured by family members to come back to the village, and had been terminated from their job. CONCLUSIONS: Reverse migrant workers had the attitude that it was safe to travel during the lockdown. About one-fifth of the reverse migrant workers reported no place to live and fear of getting an infection. The reverse migrant workers also reported feeling low and gloomy, restless, and uncertain about the future and fear of death. Lack of jobs was a major factor driving migrant workers from their native homes.","Chavan, B S; Sidana, Ajeet; Arun, Priti; Rohilla, Ravi; Singh, Gurvinder Pal; Solanki, R K; Aneja, Jitender; Murara, Mankirat Kaur; Verma, Madhur; Chakraborty, Saikat",Prim. care companion CNS disord.

408803,Ensuring continuity of care of hematologic patients during COVID-19 pandemic in a tertiary hospital in Lombardy (Italy),2020,"A SARS-CoV2 super-spreading event occurred during carnival in a small town in Germany. Due to the rapidly imposed lockdown and its relatively closed community, this town was seen as an ideal model to investigate the infection fatality rate (IFR). Here, a 7-day seroepidemiological observational study was performed to collect information and biomaterials from a random, household-based study population. The number of infections was determined by IgG analyses and PCR testing. We found that of the 919 individuals with evaluable infection status, 15.5% (95% CI:[12.3%; 19.0%]) were infected. This is a fivefold higher rate than the reported cases for this community (3.1%). 22.2% of all infected individuals were asymptomatic. The estimated IFR was 0.36% (95% CI:[0.29%; 0.45%]) for the community and 0.35% [0.28%; 0.45%] when age-standardized to the population of the community. Participation in carnival increased both infection rate (21.3% versus 9.5%, p < 0.001) and number of symptoms (estimated relative mean increase 1.6, p = 0.007). While the infection rate here is not representative for Germany, the IFR is useful to estimate the consequences of the pandemic in places with similar healthcare systems and population characteristics. Whether the super-spreading event not only increases the infection rate but also affects the IFR requires further investigation.","Streeck, Hendrik; Schulte, Bianca; Kümmerer, Beate M; Richter, Enrico; Höller, Tobias; Fuhrmann, Christine; Bartok, Eva; Dolscheid-Pommerich, Ramona; Berger, Moritz; Wessendorf, Lukas; Eschbach-Bludau, Monika; Kellings, Angelika; Schwaiger, Astrid; Coenen, Martin; Hoffmann, Per; Stoffel-Wagner, Birgit; Nöthen, Markus M; Eis-Hübinger, Anna M; Exner, Martin; Schmithausen, Ricarda Maria; Schmid, Matthias; Hartmann, Gunther",Nat Commun,,217
409045,Low-cost production of handrubs and face shields in developing countries fighting the COVID19 pandemic,2020,"A novel series of peptidomimetic aldehydes was designed and synthesized to target 3C protease (3Cpro) of enterovirus 71 (EV71). Most of the compounds exhibited high antiviral activity, and among them, compound 18p demonstrated potent enzyme inhibitory activity and broad-spectrum antiviral activity on a panel of enteroviruses and rhinoviruses. The crystal structure of EV71 3Cpro in complex with 18p determined at a resolution of 1.2 Å revealed that 18p covalently linked to the catalytic Cys147 with an aldehyde group. In addition, these compounds also exhibited good inhibitory activity against the 3CLpro and the replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), especially compound 18p (IC50 = 0.034 µM, EC50 = 0.29 µM). According to our previous work, these compounds have no reasons for concern regarding acute toxicity.

410623,"Teneille Brown, Leslie Francis, and James Tabery respond",2021,"Importance: Stay-at-home policies related to the COVID-19 pandemic could disrupt adolescents' substance use and physical activity. Objective: To compare adolescents' substance use and physical activity behaviors before and after stay-at-home restrictions. Design, Setting, and Participants: Ongoing prospective cohort study of tobacco use behaviors among ninth- and tenth-grade students enrolled at 8 public high schools in Northern California from March 2019 to February 2020 and followed up from September 2019 to September 2020. Race/ethnicity was self-classified from investigator-provided categories and collected owing to racial/ethnic differences in tobacco and substance use. Exposures: In California, a COVID-19 statewide stay-at-home order was imposed March 19, 2020. In this study, 521 six-month follow-up responses were completed before the order and 485 were completed after the order. Main Outcomes and Measures: The prevalence of substance use (ie, past 30-day use of e-cigarettes, other tobacco, cannabis, and alcohol) and physical activity (active &#8805;5 days/week) was compared at baseline and follow-up. A difference-in-difference approach was used to assess whether changes from baseline to 6-month follow-up varied if follow-up occurred after the stay-at-home order, adjusting for baseline behaviors and characteristics. All models were weighted for losses to follow-up using the inverse probability method. Weights were derived from a logistic regression model for having a follow-up response (dependent variable), as predicted by baseline characteristics and behaviors. Results: Of 1423 adolescents enrolled at baseline, 1006 completed 6-month follow-up (623 [62%] were female, and 492 [49%] were non-Hispanic White). e-Cigarette use declined from baseline to 6-month follow-up completed before the stay-at-home order (17.3% [89 of 515] to 11.3% [58 of 515]; McNemar &#967;2 = 13.54; exact P < .001) and 6-month follow-up completed after the stay-at-home order (19.9% [96 of 482] to 10.8% [52 of 482]; McNemar &#967;2 = 26.16; exact P < .001), but the extent of decline did not differ statistically between groups responding before vs after the stay-at-home order (difference-in-difference adjusted odds ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.47-1.52; P = .58). In contrast, being physically active was unchanged from baseline if follow-up was before the order (53.7% [279 of 520] to 52.9% [275 of 520]; McNemar &#967;2 = 0.09; exact P = .82) but declined sharply from baseline if follow-up was after the order (54.0% [261 of 483] to 38.1% [184 of 483]; McNemar &#967;2 = 30.72; exact P < .001), indicating a pronounced difference in change from baseline after the stay-at-home order (difference-in-difference adjusted odds ratio, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.35-0.69; P < .001). Overall in the cohort, reported use of other tobacco, cannabis, and alcohol did not differ meaningfully before and after the order. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort, a reduction in e-cigarette use occurred independently of COVID-19 stay-at-home restrictions, but persistent cannabis and alcohol use suggest continued need for youth substance use prevention and cessation support. Declining physical activity during the pandemic is a health concern.","Chaffee, Benjamin W; Cheng, Jing; Couch, Elizabeth T; Hoeft, Kristin S; Halpern-Felsher, Bonnie",JAMA pediatr. (Print),,217

410935,What will the long-lasting effect of the COVID-19 pandemic be on children's health and wellbeing?,2020,"COVID-19 spread across the globe at an immense rate has left healthcare systems incapacitated to diagnose and test patients at the needed rate. Studies have shown promising results for detection of COVID-19 from viral bacterial pneumonia in chest X-rays. Automation of COVID-19 testing using medical images can speed up the testing process of patients where health care systems lack sufficient numbers of the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests. Supervised deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) need enough labeled data for all classes to correctly learn the task of detection. Gathering labeled data is a cumbersome task and requires time and resources which could further strain health care systems and radiologists at the early stages of a pandemic such as COVID-19. In this study, we propose a randomized generative adversarial network (RANDGAN) that detects images of an unknown class (COVID-19) from known and labelled classes (Normal and Viral Pneumonia) without the need for labels and training data from the unknown class of images (COVID-19). We used the largest publicly available COVID-19 chest X-ray dataset, COVIDx, which is comprised of Normal, Pneumonia, and COVID-19 images from multiple public databases. In this work, we use transfer learning to segment the lungs in the COVIDx dataset. Next, we show why segmentation of the region of interest (lungs) is vital to correctly learn the task of classification, specifically in datasets that contain images from different resources as it is the case for the COVIDx dataset. Finally, we show improved results in detection of COVID-19 cases using our generative model (RANDGAN) compared to conventional generative adversarial networks (GANs) for anomaly detection in medical images, improving the area under the ROC curve from 0.71 to 0.77.","Motamed, Saman; Rogalla, Patrik; Khalvati, Farzad",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.06418v1.pdf,217

With an increased focus on online and virtual programming, there has been an uptick in social media usage by orthopaedics residencies as a means of communicating with applicants. This study investigated the growth in utilization of social media platforms by residency programs since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Instagram and Twitter were queried for each orthopaedic surgery residency program. It was determined if each program with a corresponding social media account was created before or after March 1, 2020. The number of posts per month were tabulated for accounts that existed prior to March 1, 2020. Results: 187 orthopaedic surgery residency programs were identified using the AAMC ERAS database. Of these programs, 74 (41.6%) were found to have an Instagram profile, and 50 (26.7%) were found to have a Twitter page. Of the 74 Instagram profiles, 45 were created after March 1, 2020, representing a 155% increase. Of the 50 Twitter pages, 15 were created after March 1, 2020, representing a 43% increase. Instagram accounts that were active before the pandemic had a 96% increase in the number of posts per month, on average, after March 1, 2020. Conclusion: Over one-third of programs are utilizing social media for recruitment purposes. There has been an 155% increase in Instagram and 43% increase in Twitter usage by residency programs since March 1, 2020.

METHODS: All patients aged 80 years or older who underwent surgery between January 2000 and December 2013 at a high-level heart center were included in the study. The in-hospital data of study patients were obtained from the electronic database and from the hospital files. Survival data were analyzed as a long-term outcome. RESULTS: A total of 245 patients aged 80-93 years were evaluated in the study. The patients were followed up 5.4±3.7 years after open-heart surgery. In-hospital mortality rates were 10% in elective cases and 15.1% overall. Age &#8805;85 years, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and emergency surgery were independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. The median survival time was found to be 4.4±0.3 years for all participants. The long-term survival of patients who underwent emergency cardiac surgery was significantly lower than that of elective patients (log-rank <0.001). CONCLUSION: Octogenarians have satisfactory long-term outcomes after open-heart surgery when operated electively. On the other hand, patients operated under emergency conditions have worse inhospital outcomes and long-term follow-up results.","Aksüt, Mehmet; Günay, Deniz; Özer, Tanil; Yerlikhan, Özge Altas; Selçuk, Emre; Kirali, Mehmet Kaan",Braz J Cardiovasc Surg,,217
413214,"Where Did All the Appendicitis Go? Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Volume, Management, and Outcomes of Acute Appendicitis in a Nationwide, Multicenter Analysis",2021,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to almost 3,000,000 deaths across 139 million people infected worldwide. Involvement of the pulmonary vasculature is considered a major driving force for morbidity and mortality. We set out to summarize current knowledge on the acute manifestations of pulmonary vascular disease (PVD) resulting from COVID-19 and prioritize long-term complications that may result in pulmonary hypertension (PH). RECENT FINDINGS: Acute COVID-19 infection can result in widespread involvement of the pulmonary vasculature, myocardial injury, evidence of persistent lung disease, and venous thromboembolism. Post COVID-19 survivors frequently report ongoing symptoms and may be at risk for the spectrum of PH, including group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension, group 2 PH due to left heart disease, group 3 PH due to lung disease and/or hypoxia, and group 4 chronic thromboembolic PH. SUMMARY: The impact of COVID-19 on the pulmonary vasculature is central to determining disease severity. Although the long-term PVD manifestations of COVID-19 are currently uncertain, optimizing the care of risk factors for PH and monitoring for the development of PVD will be critical to reducing long-term morbidity and improving the health of survivors.","Cascino, Thomas M; Desai, Ankit A; Kanthi, Yogendra",Curr. opin. pulm. med,,217

413563,A segregated-team model to maintain cancer care during the COVID-19 outbreak at an academic center in Singapore,2020,"BACKGROUND: Post-stroke shoulder-hand syndrome (PSSHS) is one of the most common sequelae in patients with stroke. Previous studies have reported that extracorporeal shock wave (EPSW) has been used to treat this condition effectively. However, its conclusions are still inconsistent. Therefore, this study will provide evidence to systematically assess the effectiveness and safety of EPSW for the treatment of PSSHS. METHODS: We will comprehensively search relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effectiveness and safety of EPSW for the treatment of PSSHS in the following databases from their start to February 1, 2020 without language and publication date limitations: Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, PsycINFO, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure. For trials that meet all inclusion criteria, 2 researchers will independently extract the data from them and appraise study quality by Cochrane risk of bias. Any differences will be solved by discussion with the help of another researcher. All data will be performed and analyzed using RevMan 5.3 software. RESULTS: We will summarize up-to-date high quality RCTs to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of EPSW for the treatment of PSSHS. CONCLUSIONS: This study will provide a comprehensive evidence summary to determine whether EPSW is effective and safety for the treatment of PSSHS or not.

413909,Deciphering the Optimum Doctor-Patient Communication Strategy During COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"OBJECTIVES: In December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan City and rapidly spread across the world. The clinical characteristics of affected patients in different regions and populations may differ. Thus, this study aimed to identify the characteristics of the disease to provide an insight about the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. METHODS: Data on the demographic characteristics and clinical findings of the patients admitted at the First Hospital of Changsha from January 1, 2020 to February 10, 2020 were assessed. RESULTS: In this study, there were 8 (3.8%) asymptomatic, 21 (10.0%) mild upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), and 180 (86.1%) pneumonia cases. In total, 47 (22.5%) patients resided in Wuhan, and 45 (21.5%) had recently traveled to Wuhan before disease onset. Moreover, 19 (9.1%) had contact with people from Wuhan, and 69 (33.0%) were family cluster cases. The median incubation period was approximately 6.3 (range: 1.0-20.0) days. Fever and cough were the most common initial symptoms: 99 (49.3%) patients presented with fever, without cough; 59 (29.4%) with cough, without fever; and 33 (16.4%) with both fever and cough. CONCLUSION: The symptoms of patients with COVID-19 were relatively mild outside Wuhan, and family cluster was a remarkable epidemic characteristic. Special attention should be paid to asymptomatic patients.","Liu, Ping; Niu, Ruichao; Chen, Jie; Tang, Yuling; Tang, Wenfang; Xu, Linyan; Feng, Juntao",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,,217
414139,How to Prioritise and Optimise Access to Elective Surgery in the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Interhospital Alliance Pathway Based on the SWALIS 2020 Model. A Single-Cohort Feasibility & Pilot Study,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Healthy elderly, mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease populations have been among the most affected in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic due to the direct effects of the virus, and numerous indirect effects now emerge and will have to be carefully assessed over time. METHODS: This article reviews the main articles that have been published so far about the direct and indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on these particularly fragile populations. RESULTS: The pandemic associated to COVID-19 has shifted most of the health resources to the emergency area and has consequently left the three main medical areas dealing with the elderly population (oncology, time-dependent diseases and degenerative disease) temporarily ""uncovered"". In the phase following the emergency, it will be crucial to guarantee to each area the economic and organizational resources to quickly return to the level of support of the prepandemic state. CONCLUSIONS: The emergency phase represented a significant occasion of discussion on the possibilities of telemedicine which will inevitably become increasingly important, but all the limits of its use in the elderly population have to be considered. In the post-lockdown recovery phase, alongside the classic medical evaluation, the psychological evaluation must become even more important for doctors caring about people with cognitive decline as well as with their caregivers.","Iodice, Francesco; Cassano, Valeria; Rossini, Paolo M",Neurol Sci,,217

Results From the Multicenter British Orthopaedic Oncology Society Observational Study,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To identify what motivates medical students to join a pandemic emergency healthcare workforce. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Aalborg University, Denmark. PARTICIPANTS: All medical students. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Motivational points as perceived by the students to be important. Demographic characteristics and 11 motivational domains scored on a Visual Analog Scale from 0 (low) to 100 (high) responding to the question: 'To what degree are the following statements important for you to join a national emergency preparedness workforce?' The questionnaire was developed by an expert panel in a process of four iterations. RESULTS: A total of 486 students of 688 (70.6%) completed the survey within 7 days in March 2020. 80% had decided to join the pandemic emergency healthcare workforce. Ranked median scores for motivational statements in each domain were: care, 100; learn, 90; pride, 83; team, 77; needed, 75; safety, 75; supervision, 75; job, 73; duty, 66; salary, 62; historic, 50. Supervision (p<0.001), salary (p<0.001) and duty (p=0.001) were given increasing priority with advancing study years. Interestingly, students added that support by the university and clarification of study plans were priorities. CONCLUSIONS: Results guide decision-makers and colleagues on how to motivate or reinforce medical students in joining the pandemic emergency healthcare workforce. Importantly, students emphasised protection for themselves.","Astorp, Mike Sæderup; Sørensen, Gustav Valentin Blichfeldt; Rasmussen, Sten; Emmersen, Jeppe; Erbs, Alexander Wolfhagen; Andersen, Stig",BMJ Open,,217

Dating apps were popularised in the early 2010s and result from the digitisation of dating services that began in the 1990s. Dating apps are also associated with important health-related issues. Health researchers and practitioners have quickly identified dating apps as potential tools that could be leveraged to reach target populations. The Coronavirus disease (COVID) pandemic is a uniquely rich case study for examining the role of dating apps as responsive to digital health. Like many popular social media platforms, dating app companies started communicating with their users about the risks related to the novel coronavirus by mid-March 2020. Dating apps that cater to queer men were particularly active in health communication. In-app communications were not exclusively used to engage in digital health but were also mobilised in marketing ploys. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, Deborah Lupton and Karen Willis.","Myles, D.; Duguay, S.; Dietzel, C.",The COVID-19 Crisis: Social Perspectives,,217

418605,Analysis Of Mortality Following Trauma And Orthopaedic Surgery At The Peak Of COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Early reports have suggested that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can present with significant urinary frequency and nocturia, and that these symptoms correlate with markers of inflammation in the urine. We evaluated surrogate markers of chronic urinary symptoms to determine if they were more frequent after COVID-19 infection. METHODS: Routinely collected data from the province of Ontario was used to conduct a matched, retrospective cohort study. We identified patients 66 years of age or older who had a positive COVID-19 test between February and May 2020 and survived at least 2 months after their diagnosis. We matched them to two similar patients who did not have a positive COVID-19 test during the same time period. We measured the frequency of urology consultation, cystoscopy, and new prescriptions for overactive bladder medications during a subsequent 3-month period. Proportional hazard models were adjusted for any baseline differences between the groups. RESULTS: We matched 5617 patients with COVID-19 to 11,225 people who did not have COVID-19. The groups were similar, aside from a higher proportion of patients having hypertension and diabetes in the CoVID-19 cohort. There was no significantly increased hazard of new receipt of overactive bladder medication (hazards ratio [HR]: 1.04, p = 0.88), urology consultation (HR: 1.40, p = 0.10), or cystoscopy (HR: 1.14, p = 0.50) among patients who had COVID-19, compared to the matched cohort. CONCLUSION: Surrogate markers of potential bladder dysfunction were not significantly increased in the 2-5 months after COVID-19 infection.","Welk, Blayne; Richard, Lucie; Braschi, Emmanuel; Averbeck, Marcio A",Neurourol. urodyn,,217
419229,Covid-19: Two thirds of healthcare workers who have died were from ethnic minorities,2020,"Co-infection has been reported in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome, but there is limited knowledge on co-infection among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The prevalence of co-infection was variable among COVID-19 patients in different studies, however, it could be up to 50% among non-survivors. Co-pathogens included bacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumonia, Legionella pneumophila and Acinetobacter baumannii; Candida species and Aspergillus flavus; and viruses such as influenza, coronavirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, parainfluenza, metapneumovirus, influenza B virus, and human immunodeficiency virus. Influenza A was one of the most common co-infective viruses, which may have caused initial false-negative results of real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Laboratory and imaging findings alone cannot help distinguish co-infection from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Newly developed syndromic multiplex panels that incorporate SARS-CoV-2 may facilitate the early detection of co-infection among COVID-19 patients. By contrast, clinicians cannot rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection by ruling in other respiratory pathogens through old syndromic multiplex panels at this stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, clinicians must have a high index of suspicion for coinfection among COVID-19 patients. Clinicians can neither rule out other co-infections caused by respiratory pathogens by diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection nor rule out COVID-19 by detection of non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory pathogens. After recognizing the possible pathogens causing co-infection among COVID-19 patients, appropriate antimicrobial agents can be recommended.","Lai, Chih-Cheng; Wang, Cheng-Yi; Hsueh, Po-Ren",J Microbiol Immunol Infect,,217

421549,Informing critical care drug requirements in response to the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"A novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged as the causative agent behind the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Treatment efforts have been severely impeded due to the lack of specific effective antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-associated pathologies. In the present research endeavour the inhibitory prospects of cyanobacterial metabolites were assessed at the active binding pockets of the two vital SARS-CoV-2 proteases namely, main protease (Mpro) and the papain-like protease (PLpro) that proteolytically process viral polyproteins and facilitate viral replication, employing an in silico molecular interaction-based approach. It was evident from our analysis based on the binding energy scores that the metabolites cylindrospermopsin, deoxycylindrospermopsin, carrageenan, cryptophycin 52, eucapsitrione, tjipanazole, tolyporphin and apratoxin A exhibited promising inhibitory potential against the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The compounds cryptophycin 1, cryptophycin 52 and deoxycylindrospermopsin were observed to display encouraging binding energy scores with the PLpro of SARS-CoV-2. Subsequent estimation of physicochemical properties and potential toxicity of the metabolites followed by robust molecular dynamics simulations and analysis of MM-PBSA energy scoring function established deoxycylindrospermopsin as the most promising inhibitory candidate against both SARS-CoV-2 proteases. Present research findings bestow ample scopes to further exploit the potential of deoxycylindrospermopsin as a successful inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and in vivo and pave the foundation for the development of novel effective therapeutics against COVID-19.

422191,Reduced adrenal surgery in COVID-19 pandemic: a possible ticking time bomb,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic prompted a rapid change in primary care provision. There was a significant shift from face-to-face appointments to remote methods such as electronic consultation (e-consultation). Patients from a primary care provider in London were actively encouraged to use an online consultation platform called 'Dr iQ'. A group of high frequency users of Dr iQ emerged and clinicians were concerned their health needs were not being met through the platform. High frequency attendance in a traditional general practice setting is associated with increased time and healthcare costs.This project evaluated the number of high frequency users (identified as 10 or more consultations a month) of Dr iQ in one busy inner city practice over a 5-month period. We aimed to decrease the subsequent monthly usage frequency of all Dr iQ high frequency users from 10 or more consultations to less than 10 consultations. Our interventions included a semi-structured telephone interview, discussion among the multidisciplinary team, and regular scheduled telephone or face-to-face appointments. Following two Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles, all 12 high frequency users showed a decrease in the number of consultations submitted to Dr iQ to less than 10 consultations a month.This project proposes a method of case managing high frequency users of e-consultation. The majority of high frequency users had unmet health needs and felt a lack of continuity of care on Dr iQ. They often had complex physical and mental health problems. As remote consulting technology continues to develop, more research is required to understand the epidemiology and aetiology of e-consultation high frequency use in order to improve patient outcomes.","Leung, Katherine; Qureshi, Saffan",,,217
422192,Reduced adrenal surgery in COVID-19 pandemic: a possible ticking time bomb,2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Primarily an infection of the lower respiratory tract, it is now well known to cause multisystem abnormalities. Hematologic manifestations constitute a significant area of concern. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infects monocytes and endothelial cells leading to a complex downstream cascade, cytokine storm, and eventual intravascular thrombosis. Coronavirus disease 2019 causes lymphopenia, neutrophilia, and thrombocytopenia. Prophylactic anticoagulation is vital in patients with coronavirus disease 2019, as its effect on the coagulation system is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The disease can cause both arterial and venous thromboses, especially pulmonary embolism and pulmonary microthrombi. A high index of suspicion is indispensable in recognizing these complications, and timely institution of therapeutic anticoagulation is vital in treating them. Virus-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation is uncommon but shares some similarities to sepsis-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation. Marked elevations in hematologic biomarkers such as lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, ferritin, and C-reactive protein are associated with worse outcomes. Understanding the pathophysiology and recognizing factors associated with poor prognosis are crucial in improving patient outcomes with coronavirus disease 2019.","Rahi, Mandeep Singh; Jindal, Vishal; Reyes, Sandra-Patrucco; Gunasekaran, Kulothungan; Gupta, Ruby; Jaiyesimi, Ishmael",Ann Hematol,,217

The COVID-19 pandemic has shown how existing structural inequities, primarily along racial lines, are exacerbated. It has also shown the value of community-based food systems work that helps communities network, sharing valuable resources and funding to respond to the ongoing crisis. In this article, we document how CEFS' community-based food systems initiatives are responding to the pandemic. Some of CEFS programs are community-based, working with food policy councils, offering racial equity trainings, networking schools and early care and education sites, and supporting youth convenings and internships. Others are focused on production and supply chains for meat, seafood, and produce in order to develop stronger local food systems. Throughout the work of all of CEFS' community-based food systems initiatives in response to the pandemic, we have learned that our past efforts have increased local food systems resilience. We also note the importance of flexible funders who allowed grant dollars to be reallocated to community partners to address urgent needs. We have found that online programming has increased participation and access to resources. Finally, we have been inspired by the creativity, flexibility, and adaptability of our community partners, and we are energized to continue to support them while also offering the resources we have developed to a broader audience.","Ammons, S.; Blacklin, S.; Bloom, D.; Brown, S.; Cappellazzi, M.; Creamer, N.; Cruz, A.; Hynson, J.; Knight, G.; Lauffer, L.; Liang, K.; Menius, L.; Piner, A.; Smallwood, A.; Stout, R.; Stover, C.; Thraves, T.; Ukah, B.",Journal of Agriculture Food Systems and Community Development,,217

Here we provide a synthesis of the techniques and associated findings in relation to COVID-19 and its geographic, environmental, and socio-demographic characteristics, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) methodology for scoping reviews. We searched PubMed for relevant articles and discussed the results separately for three categories: disease mapping, exposure mapping, and spatial epidemiological modeling. The majority of studies were ecological in nature and primarily carried out in China, Brazil, and the USA. The most common spatial methods used were clustering, hotspot analysis, space-time scan statistic, and regression modeling. Researchers used a wide range of spatial and statistical software to apply spatial analysis for the purpose of disease mapping, exposure mapping, and epidemiological modeling. Factors limiting the use of these spatial techniques were the unavailability and bias of COVID-19 data-along with scarcity of fine-scaled demographic, environmental, and socio-economic data-which restrained most of the researchers from exploring causal relationships of potential influencing factors of COVID-19. Our review identified geospatial analysis in COVID-19 research and highlighted current trends and research gaps. Since most of the studies found centered on Asia and the Americas, there is a need for more comparable spatial studies using geographically fine-scaled data in other areas of the world.","Fatima, Munazza; O039,; Keefe, Kara J; Wei, Wenjia; Arshad, Sana; Gruebner, Oliver",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,217

Here we report that immunization with different variant spikes elicits distinct neutralizing kinetics and magnitudes against other SARS-CoV-2 variants. After immunizing hamsters with wild-type or mutant SARS-CoV-2 bearing variant spikes from Alpha, Beta, Gamma, or Epsilon, the animals developed faster and greater neutralization activities against homologous SARS-CoV-2 variants than heterologous variants, including Delta. The rank of neutralizing titers against different heterologous variants varied, depending on the immunized variant spikes. The differences in neutralizing titers between homologous and heterologous variants were as large as 62-, 15-, and 9.7-fold at days 14, 28, and 45 post-immunization, respectively. Nevertheless, all immunized hamsters were protected from challenges with all SARS-CoV-2 variants, including those exhibiting the lowest neutralizing antibody titers.

431419,Lessons learned - Outbreaks of COVID-19 in nursing homes,2020,"COVID-19, a new pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, was first identified in 2019 in Wuhan, China. The novel corona virus SARS-CoV-2 and the 2002 SARS-CoV have 74% identity and use similar mechanisms to gain entry into the cell. Both the viruses enter the host cell by binding of the viral spike glycoprotein to the host receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Targeting entry of the virus has a better advantage than inhibiting the later stages of the viral life cycle. The crystal structure of the SARS-CoV (6CRV: full length S protein) and SARS-CoV-2 Spike proteins (6M0J: Receptor binding domain, RBD) was used to determine potential small molecule inhibitors. Curcumin, a naturally occurring phytochemical in Curcuma longa, is known to have broad pharmacological properties. In the present study, curcumin and its derivatives were docked, using Autodock 4.2, onto the 6CRV and 6M0J to study their capability to act as inhibitors of the spike protein and thereby, viral entry. The curcumin and its derivatives displayed binding energies, &#916;G, ranging from -10.98 to -5.12 kcal/mol (6CRV) and -10.01 to -5.33 kcal/mol (6M0J). The least binding energy was seen in bis-demethoxycurcumin with: &#916;G = -10.98 kcal/mol (6CRV) and -10.01 kcal/mol (6M0J). A good binding energy, drug likeness and efficient pharmacokinetic parameters suggest the potential of curcumin and few of its derivatives as SARS-CoV-2 spike protein inhibitors. However, further research is necessary to investigate the ability of these compounds as viral entry inhibitors. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

A unified set of renewal equations where incidence, prevalence and cumulative incidence can all be recovered from the same stochastic process has not been attempted. Here, we derive a set of renewal equations from an age-dependent branching process with a time-varying reproduction number. Our new derivation utilises a measure-theoretic approach and yields a fully self-contained mathematical exposition. We find that the renewal equations commonly used in epidemiology for modelling incidence are an equivalent special case of our equations. We show that these our equations are internally consistent in the sense that they can be separately linked under the common back calculation approach between prevalence and incidence. We introduce a computationally efficient discretisation scheme to solve these renewal equations, and this algorithm is highly parallelisable as it relies on row sums and elementwise multiplication. Finally we present a simple simulation example in the probabilistic programming language Stan where we jointly fit incidence and prevalence under a single time-varying reproduction number and generation interval.","Berah, Tresnia; Mellan, Thomas A.; Miscouridou, Xenia; Mishra, Swapnil; Parag, Kris V.; Pakkanen, Mikko S.; Bhatt, Samir",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.05579v1.pdf,217

What Needs to Be Done?,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has been associated with Interstitial Lung Disease features. The immune transcriptomic overlap between Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) and COVID-19 has not been investigated. METHODS: we analyzed blood transcript levels of 50 genes known to predict IPF mortality in three COVID-19 and two IPF cohorts. The Scoring Algorithm of Molecular Subphenotypes (SAMS) was applied to distinguish high versus low-risk profiles in all cohorts. SAMS cutoffs derived from the COVID-19 Discovery cohort were used to predict intensive care unit (ICU) status, need for mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital mortality in the COVID-19 Validation cohort. A COVID-19 Single-cell RNA-sequencing cohort was used to identify the cellular sources of the 50-gene risk profiles. The same COVID-19 SAMS cutoffs were used to predict mortality in the IPF cohorts. FINDINGS: 50-gene risk profiles discriminated severe from mild COVID-19 in the Discovery cohort (P = 0·015) and predicted ICU admission, need for mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital mortality (AUC: 0·77, 0·75, and 0·74, respectively, P < 0·001) in the COVID-19 Validation cohort. In COVID-19, 50-gene expressing cells with a high-risk profile included monocytes, dendritic cells, and neutrophils, while low-risk profile-expressing cells included CD4+, CD8+ T lymphocytes, IgG producing plasmablasts, B cells, NK, and gamma/delta T cells. Same COVID-19 SAMS cutoffs were also predictive of mortality in the University of Chicago (HR:5·26, 95%CI:1·81-15·27, P = 0·0013) and Imperial College of London (HR:4·31, 95%CI:1·81-10·23, P = 0·0016) IPF cohorts. INTERPRETATION: 50-gene risk profiles in peripheral blood predict COVID-19 and IPF outcomes. The cellular sources of these gene expression changes suggest common innate and adaptive immune responses in both diseases.

A cross-sectional analysis of six hospitals in the north-west of England,2020,"Public parks serve an important societal function as recreational spaces for diverse communities of people, with well documented physical and mental health benefits. As such, parks may be crucial for how people have handled effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly the increasingly limited recreational opportunities, widespread financial uncertainty, and consequent heightened anxiety. Despite the documented benefits of parks, however, many states have instituted park shutdown orders due to fears that public parks could facilitate SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Here we use geotagged social media data from state, county, and local parks throughout New Jersey to examine whether park visitation increased when the COVID-19 pandemic began and whether park shutdown orders were effective at deterring park usage. We compare park usage during four discrete stages of spring 2020: (1) before the pandemic began, (2) during the beginning of the pandemic, (3) during the New Jersey governor's state-wide park shutdown order, and (4) following the lifting of the shutdown. We find that park visitation increased by 63.4% with the onset of the pandemic. The subsequent park shutdown order caused visitation in closed parks to decline by 76.1% while parks that remained open continued to experience elevated visitation levels. Visitation then returned to elevated pre-shutdown levels when closed parks were allowed to reopen. Altogether, our results indicate that parks continue to provide crucial services to society, particularly in stressful times when opportunities for recreation are limited. Furthermore, our results suggest that policies targeting human behavior can be effective and are largely reversible. As such, we should continue to invest in public parks and to explore the role of parks in managing public health and psychological well-being.","Volenec, Zoe M; Abraham, Joel O; Becker, Alexander D; Dobson, Andy P",PLoS One,,217

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to better characterize the hypercoagulable state of COVID-19 patients in patients receiving anticoagulant therapy. METHODS: We took plasma samples of 23 patients with COVID-19 who were on prophylactic or intensified anticoagulant therapy. Twenty healthy volunteers were included to establish reference ranges. RESULTS: COVID-19 patients had a mildly prolonged prothrombin time, high von Willebrand factor levels and low ADAMTS13 activity. Most rotational thromboelastometry parameters were normal, with a hypercoagulable maximum clot firmness in part of the patients. Despite detectable anti-activated factor X activity in the majority of patients, ex vivo thrombin generation was normal, and in vivo thrombin generation elevated as evidenced by elevated levels of thrombin-antithrombin complexes and D-dimers. Plasma levels of activated factor VII were lower in patients, and levels of the platelet activation marker soluble CD40 ligand were similar in patients and controls. Plasmin-antiplasmin complex levels were also increased in patients despite an in vitro hypofibrinolytic profile. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients are characterized by normal in vitro thrombin generation and enhanced clot formation and decreased fibrinolytic potential despite the presence of heparin in the sample. Anticoagulated COVID-19 patients have persistent in vivo activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis, but no evidence of excessive platelet activation. Ongoing activation of coagulation despite normal to intensified anticoagulant therapy indicates studies on alternative antithrombotic strategies are urgently required.","Blasi, Annabel; von Meijenfeldt, Fien A; Adelmeijer, Jelle; Calvo, Andrea; Ibañez, Cristina; Perdomo, Juan; Reverter, Juan C; Lisman, Ton",J. thromb. haemost,,217

We find a general mechanism for the distribution. If we suppose the normal distributions for a growth coefficient and a number of growth (or the duration of growth) and a correlation between them in a geometrically progressing system, the distribution of the system can reach approximately a log - completely quadratic of chi distribution with 1 degree of freedom (log-CQ$\chi_1$), which is asymptotically a power law distribution. Furthermore, the asymptotic exponent of the power law is inversely proportional to the product of standard deviations of both the number of growth and the growth coefficient and their correlation but independent on an initial distribution of the system. The mechanism shows a comprehensiveness to be involved in wide practice.","Chol-Jun, Kim",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.11828v2.pdf,217
436394,Evaluation of Patients Presenting to the Ophthalmology Department of a Tertiary Hospital for Nonemergency Reasons During the Covid-19 Pandemic,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing stressor that may have detrimental effects on mental health. Theoretical and empirical literature implies that individuals who are characterized by catastrophic appraisals of somatic cues, a tendency known as anxiety sensitivity, as well as by older subjective age, might be particularly vulnerable to depression and anxiety during the pandemic. Furthermore, subjective age might moderate the relations between anxiety sensitivity with depression and anxiety symptoms. Yet, research to date has not explored the contribution of both anxiety sensitivity and subjective age in explaining distress following stress in general, nor in light of the current COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: Filling this gap, a convenience sample of 828 participants, (Mage = 43.98, SD = 14.06), filled questionnaires measuring background variables, COVID-19 related stressors, anxiety sensitivity, subjective age, and anxiety and depression symptoms during the pandemic. RESULTS: Positive associations were found between anxiety sensitivity and subjective age, on the one hand, and anxiety and depression symptoms, on the other. Furthermore, subjective age moderated the associations between anxiety sensitivity with depression and anxiety symptoms. Although higher levels of anxiety sensitivity were related to depression and anxiety during the pandemic, these associations were stronger among participants with an older subjective age. DISCUSSION: The findings are consistent with theories that view subjective age as an intra-individual construct involved in modulating important mental health outcomes in the context of coping with stress.","Avidor, Sharon; Abu Hamam, Asmaa; Lahav, Yael",,,217

We start by categorizing all post-1960 recessions in advanced countries and emerging markets into supply-shock, demand-shock and both-shock induced recessions. We measure recovery duration as the number of years required to re-attain pre-recession levels of output or employment. We then rely on the earlier literature on business cycle dynamics to identify candidate variables that can help to account for variations in recovery duration following different kinds of shocks. By asking which of these variables are operative in the Covid-19 recession, we can then draw inferences about the duration of the recovery under different scenarios. A number of our statistical results point in the direction of lengthy recoveries.","Eichengreen, Barry Park Donghyun Shin Kwanho",Journal of Macroeconomics,,217
437581,Disinfection of 3D-printed protective face shield during COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"In this paper, a new implicit-explicit local method with an arbitrary order is produced for stiff initial value problems. Here, a general method for one-step time integrations has been created, considering a direction free approach for integrations leading to a numerical method with parameter-based stability preservation. Adaptive procedures depending on the problem types for the current method are explained with the help of local error estimates to minimize the computational cost. Priority error analysis of the current method is made, and order conditions are presented in terms of direction parameters. Stability analysis of the method is performed for both scalar equations and systems of differential equations. The currently produced parameter-based method has been proven to provide A-stability, for 0.5<\theta<1, in various orders. The present method has been shown to be a very good option for addressing a wide range of initial value problems through numerical experiments. It can be seen as a significant contribution that the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered equation system parameterized for the COVID-19 pandemic has been integrated with the present method and stability properties of the method have been tested on this stiff model and significant results are produced. Some challenging stiff behaviours represented by the nonlinear Duffing equation, Robertson chemical system, and van der Pol equation have also been integrated, and the results revealed that the current algorithm produces much more reliable results than numerical techniques in the literature.","Tunc, Huseyin; Sari, Murat",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.05817v1.pdf,217
437913,COVID-19 and orthopaedic surgery: evolving strategies and early experience,2020,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Healthcare workers (HCWs) employed in hospital settings frequently experience many occupational stressors leading to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Literature has increasingly highlighted PTSD as a major issue that involves both staff and healthcare organizations; the consequences of PTSD may include medication errors and lower standards of care. The current COVID-19 pandemic poses the need for preventing PTSD in HCWs working closely with COVID-19 patients. The purpose of this systematic review was to analyze the latest developments in assessing and managing the occupational risk of PTSD symptoms in hospital HCWs. METHODS: We searched for publications in MEDLINE/Pubmed using selected keywords. Each article was reviewed and categorized into one or more of the following four categories based on its subject matter: risk assessment, risk management and occurrence rates. RESULTS: Our search resulted in a total of 32 publications that matched our inclusion criteria. Increased years of service, older age, previous year exposure to violence, personality traits (i.e. neuroticism), history of mental disorders, being non-graduates, were found to be workers' pre-trauma factors predicting PTSD symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest the need to prioritize preventative interventions aimed to anticipate the effects of traumatic exposure by training HCWs in evidence based anticipatory methods of coping with stressful events. With regard to the current COVID-19 pandemic, we found evidence of the need to strength social support and training targeted at psychological skills of medical staff who treated COVID-19 patients.","D039,; Ettorre, Gabriele; Pellicani, Vincenza; Ceccarelli, Giancarlo",Acta Biomed,,217
438533,Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgery in University Hospitals in Germany: Results of a Nationwide Survey,2020,"The perception, processing and response to environmental challenges involves the activation of the immuno-neuroendocrine (INE) interplay. Concerted environmental challenges might induce trade-off when resource allocation to one trait occurs at the expense of another, also producing potential transgenerational effects in the offspring. We evaluated whether concerted challenges, in the form of an immune inoculum against inactivated Salmonella Enteritidis (immune challenge, ICH) and a chronic heat stress (CHS) exposure on adult Japanese quail, modulates the INE responses of the parental generation and their offspring. Adults were inoculated and later exposed to a CHS along 9 consecutive days. The last 5 days of CHS, eggs were collected for incubation. Chicks were identified according to their parental treatments and remained undisturbed. Induced inflammatory response, Heterophil/Lymphocyte (H/L) ratio and specific humoral response against sheep red blood cells (SRBC) were evaluated in both generations. Regardless of the ICH, stressed adults showed a reduced inflammatory response (p<0.001) and an elevated H/L ratio (p=0.02) compared to controls. In offspring, the inflammatory response was elevated (p=0.03) and the specific SRBC antibody titers were diminished (p=0.02) in those chicks prenatally exposed to CHS, regardless of the ICH. No differences were found in the H/L ratio of the offspring. Together, our results suggest that CHS exposure influences the INE interplay of adult quail, establishing trade-offs within their immune system. Moreover, CHS not only affected parental INE responses but also modulated their offspring, probably affecting their potential to respond to future challenges. The adaptability of offspring's programming would depend on the environment encountered.","Giayetto, Octavio; Videla, Emiliano A; Chacana, Pablo; Jaime, Cristian; Marín, Raúl H; Nazar, F Nicolás",J. exp. biol,,217

438933,Correction: Results from ACROCOVID: an international survey on the care of acromegaly during the COVID-19 era,2021,"BACKGROUND: Allocation of scarce resources during a pandemic extends to the allocation of vaccines when they eventually become available. We describe a framework for priority vaccine allocation that employed a cross-disciplinary approach, guided by ethical considerations and informed by local risk assessment. METHODS: Published and grey literature was reviewed, and augmented by consultation with key informants, to collate past experience, existing guidelines and emerging strategies for pandemic vaccine deployment. Identified ethical issues and decision-making processes were also included. Concurrently, simulation modelling studies estimated the likely impacts of alternative vaccine allocation approaches. Assembled evidence was presented to a workshop of national experts in pandemic preparedness, vaccine strategy, implementation and ethics. All of this evidence was then used to generate a proposed ethical framework for vaccine priorities best suited to the Australian context. FINDINGS: Published and emerging guidance for priority pandemic vaccine distribution differed widely with respect to strategic objectives, specification of target groups, and explicit discussion of ethical considerations and decision-making processes. Flexibility in response was universally emphasised, informed by real-time assessment of the pandemic impact level, and identification of disproportionately affected groups. Model outputs aided identification of vaccine approaches most likely to achieve overarching goals in pandemics of varying transmissibility and severity. Pandemic response aims deemed most relevant for an Australian framework were: creating and maintaining trust, promoting equity, and reducing harmful outcomes. INTERPRETATION: Defining clear and ethically-defendable objectives for pandemic response in context aids development of flexible and adaptive decision support frameworks and facilitates clear communication and engagement activities.","Fielding, J; Sullivan, S G; Beard, F; Macartney, K; Williams, J; Dawson, A; Gilbert, G L; Massey, P; Crooks, K; Moss, R; McCaw, J M; McVernon, J",Vaccine,,217
439473,Neurosurgical Training During COVID-19 Pandemic: British Perspective,2020,"The importance of Early Childhood (EC) educators' wellbeing has been brought into sharp focus during the COVID-19 pandemic, as educators have navigated numerous additional stressors while providing education and care services for some children and ongoing support for many others learning at home. This study aimed to explore the impact of the pandemic on EC educators' wellbeing and educator-child relationships, as growing evidence shows the influence of these factors on children's developmental outcomes. In July 2020, members of a Research Network of EC Professionals-who previously identified educator wellbeing as a priority issue-were invited to participate in an online survey. The survey included two published, validated scales: the Early Childhood Professional Wellbeing scale (ECPW) and the Student-Teacher Relationship Scale (modified). Survey items about educators' experiences during the pandemic were also included. Two hundred and thirty-two EC educators from across Australia completed the survey, mostly from Victoria where lockdowns were most severe. Linear regression analysis demonstrated stronger professional wellbeing was associated with less conflict in educator-child relationships and lower risk of staff turnover. This was more likely to be experienced by senior or more experienced staff. Although a negative impact of COVID-19 was reported, ECPW scores were relatively high, and organizational structures supporting professional wellbeing were most strongly associated with lower risk of turnover (r = 0.63, p < 0.001). Findings highlight that supporting EC educators' wellbeing is essential for workforce retention, and for promoting quality educator-child relationships which are central to young children's learning and development.","Eadie, Patricia; Levickis, Penny; Murray, Lisa; Page, Jane; Elek, Catriona; Church, Amelia",Early Child Educ J,,217

440897,Drastic times need drastic measures: COVID-19 and widening access to medicine,2020,"Just before 2020 began, a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), brought for humans a potentially fatal disease known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The world has thoroughly been affected by COVID-19, while there has been little progress towards understanding the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Patients with a severe phenotype of disease and those who died from the disease have shown hyperinflammation and were more likely to develop neurological manifestations, linking the clinical disease with neuroimmunological features. Anosmia frequently occurs early in the course of COVID-19. The prevalence of anosmia would be influenced by self-diagnosis as well as self-misdiagnosis in patients with COVID-19. Despite this, the association between anosmia and COVID-19 has been a hope for research, aiming to understand the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Studies have suggested differently probable mechanisms for the development of anosmia in COVID-19, including olfactory cleft syndrome, postviral anosmia syndrome, cytokine storm, direct damage of olfactory sensory neurons, and impairment of the olfactory perception center in the brain. Thus, the observation of anosmia would direct us to find the pathogenesis of COVID-19 in the central nervous system, and this is consistent with numerous neurological manifestations related to COVID-19. Like other neurotropic viruses, SARS-CoV-2 might be able to enter the central nervous system via the olfactory epithelium and induce innate immune responses at the site of entry. Viral replication in the nonneural olfactory cells indirectly causes damage to the olfactory receptor nerves, and as a consequence, anosmia occurs. Further studies are required to investigate the neuroimmunology of COVID-19 in relation to anosmia.","Yazdanpanah, Niloufar; Saghazadeh, Amene; Rezaei, Nima",Rev Neurosci,,217

441175,Reactions and feelings of health professionals in the care of hospitalized patients with suspected covid-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Despite the effective scale-up of HIV testing and treatment programs, only 75% of people living with HIV (PLWH) globally know their status, and this rate is lower among men. This highlights the importance of implementing HIV testing and linkage interventions with a high uptake in this population. In a cluster randomized controlled trial conducted in Kenya between 2013 and 2015, we found that assisted partner services (APS) for HIV-exposed partners of newly diagnosed PLWH safely reached more HIV-exposed individuals with HIV testing compared with client referral alone. However, more data are needed to evaluate APS implementation in a real-world setting. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness, acceptability, fidelity, and cost of APS when integrated into existing HIV testing services (HTS) in Western Kenya. METHODS: Our study team from the University of Washington and PATH is integrating APS into 31 health facilities in Western Kenya. We are enrolling females newly diagnosed with HIV (index clients) who consent to receiving APS, their male sexual partners, and female sexual partners of male sexual partners who tested HIV positive. Female index clients and sexual partners testing HIV positive will be followed up at 6 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months postenrollment to assess linkage to care, antiretroviral therapy initiation, and HIV viral load suppression. We will evaluate the acceptability, fidelity, and cost of real-world implementation of APS via in-depth interviews conducted with national, county, and subcounty-level policy makers responsible for HTS. Facility health staff providing HTS and APS, in addition to staff working with the study project team, will also be interviewed. We will also conduct direct observations of facility infrastructure and clinical procedures and extract data from the facilities and county and national databases. RESULTS: As of March 2020, we have recruited 1724 female index clients, 3201 male partners, and 1585 female partners. We have completed study recruitment as well as 6-week (2936/2973, 98.75%), 6-month (1596/1641, 97.25%), and 12-month (725/797, 90.9%) follow-up visits. Preliminary analyses show that facilities scaling up APS identify approximately 12-18 new HIV-positive males for every 100 men contacted and tested. We are currently completing the remaining follow-up interviews and incorporating an HIV self-testing component into the study in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The results will help bridge the gap between clinical research findings and real-world practice and provide guidance regarding optimal strategies for APS integration into routine HIV service delivery.

Multiple novel sensors have been invented because diseases must be detected and diagnosed as early as possible, and recognition methods have to be carried out with minimal invasivity. Sensors have been particularly developed focusing on miniaturization by the use of nanomaterials for fabricating nanosensors. The nano-sized nature of nanomaterials and their exclusive optical, electronical, magnetical, and mechanical attributes can enhance patient care through the use of sensors with minimal invasivity and extreme sensitivity. Amongst the nanomaterials utilized for fabricating nano-sensors, carbon-based nanomaterials are promising as these sensors respond better to signals in various sensing settings. This review provides an overview of the recent developments in carbon nanomaterial-based biosensors for viral recognition based on the biomarkers that arise from the infection, the nucleic acids from the viruses, and the entire virus. The role of carbon nanomaterials is highlighted by the improvement of sensor and recognition functionality. The Dengue virus, Ebola virus, Hepatits virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza virus, Zika virus and Adenovirus are the virus types reviewed to illustrate the implementation of the techniques. Finally, the drawbacks and advantages of carbon nanomaterial-based biosensors for viral recognition are identified and discussed.","Ehtesabi, Hamide",J. Sci. Adv. Mater. Devices,,217

This study aims to summarize the latest evidence on whether the use of corticosteroids in patients with myocarditis associated with COVID-19 is necessary. Methods: We performed an extensive search using a combination of search terms in PubMed, Europe PMC, ProQuest, EBSCOhost, and Google Scholar up to January 2021. Full-text articles that met the predefined inclusion criteria were included in the present study. Results: The full-texts of 18 articles have been reviewed. Thirteen out of the eighteen (72%) patients who got corticosteroid administration experienced major clinical improvements during follow-up while the other five (28%) were experiencing uneventful events. The mean age of the reported patients was 47.8+/-13.2 years. There was no gender predominance. Most of the reported cases were from USA (39%) followed by Spain, China, and UK (11% each), while Brazil, Colombia, France, Belgium, and Italy contributed one case each. Various corticosteroids were used but the most commonly applied were methylprednisolone (89%), hydrocortisone (5.5%), and prednisolone (5.5%). The most common route of administration among the studies was intravenous administration and the duration of treatment varied between one and fourteen days. Conclusion: A review of the currently available literature shows that with the use of corticosteroid agents in treating myocarditis associated with COVID-19, favorable outcomes are attainable. Well-established randomized clinical trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of using corticosteroids in this condition.","Kamarullah, W.; Nurcahyani, Mary Josephine C.; Bill Multazam, R.; Ghaezany Nawing, A.; Dharma, S.",Archives of Academic Emergency Medicine,,217

In particular, we contribute a coherent and systematic review of state-of-the-art techniques, comparing and contrasting their architectural differences as well as training algorithms. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive overview of deep model interpretation strategies that can be used to interpret model decisions. In addition, we outline the key limitations of existing deep medical anomaly detection techniques and propose key research directions for further investigation.","Fernando, Tharindu; Gammulle, Harshala; Denman, Simon; Sridharan, Sridha; Fookes, Clinton",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.02364v1.pdf,217

Design/methodology/approach: This commentary adopts a reflective approach and is based on a review of theories on diffusion of innovation, dynamic capabilities and data ethics and governance, as well as up-to-date business reports to reflect on the ethical implications of new technologies for organisations. Findings: Organisations from different industries and sectors around the world have experienced major disruptive changes because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Adoption and integration of new ICTs occurred at an accelerated pace in a collective effort to maintain “business as usual”. The use of emergent technologies is not without risks. The commentary argues that, in times of crisis, it is vital that organisations address the growing concerns around privacy and security of personal data by designing effective data governance frameworks that go beyond a mere compliance with existing policies and prevailing data privacy and protection laws to ensure data security and protection for all stakeholders. Originality/value: This commentary is making the case for more considered approaches to data governance and data ethics in business following the unprecedented challenges posed by the recent COVID-19 pandemic and suggests possible ways of moving forward from an ethical perspective.","C Yallop, Anca; Aliasghar, Omid",Online Info.

We aimed to identify factors related to lapses in PPE use that may influence transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from patients to healthcare personnel (HCP). DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Tertiary-care medical center in Minnesota. PARTICIPANTS: In total, 345 HCP who sustained a significant occupational exposure to a patient with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from May 13, 2020, through November 30, 2020, were evaluated. RESULTS: Overall, 8 HCP (2.3%) were found to have SARS-CoV-2 infection during their 14-day postexposure quarantine. A lack of eye protection during the care of a patient with COVID-19 was associated with HCP testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) during the postexposure quarantine (relative risk [RR], 10.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28-82.39; P = .009). Overall, the most common reason for a significant exposure was the use of a surgical face mask instead of a respirator during an aerosol-generating procedure (55.9%). However, this was not associated with HCP testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the postexposure quarantine (RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.96-1; P = 1). Notably, transmission primarily occurred in units that did not regularly care for patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The use of universal eye protection is a critical aspect of PPE to prevent patient-to-HCP transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","Shah, Vishal P; Breeher, Laura E; Hainy, Caitlin M; Swift, Melanie D",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,,217
446621,Practical Advices for Treating Chronic Pain in the Time of COVID-19: A Narrative Review Focusing on Interventional Techniques,2021,"Governments have implemented social distancing measures to address the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The measures include instructions that individuals maintain social distance when in public, school closures, limitations on gatherings and business operations, and instructions to remain at home. Social distancing may have an impact on the volume and distribution of crime. Crimes such as residential burglary may decrease as a byproduct of increased guardianship over personal space and property. Crimes such as domestic violence may increase because of extended periods of contact between potential offenders and victims. Understanding the impact of social distancing on crime is critical for ensuring the safety of police and government capacity to deal with the evolving crisis. Understanding how social distancing policies impact crime may also provide insights into whether people are complying with public health measures. Examination of the most recently available data from both Los Angeles, CA, and Indianapolis, IN, shows that social distancing has had a statistically significant impact on a few specific crime types. However, the overall effect is notably less than might be expected given the scale of the disruption to social and economic life.","Mohler, George; Bertozzi, Andrea L; Carter, Jeremy; Short, Martin B; Sledge, Daniel; Tita, George E; Uchida, Craig D; Brantingham, P Jeffrey",J Crim Justice,,217

For this, a dummy was used that emits simulated human breath containing aerosols (mean diameter of 0.3 µm) and CO2, with a horizontal exhalation velocity of v = 2.4 m/s, measured 10 cm in front of the mouth. Aerosol and CO2 concentration profiles were mapped using sensors placed around the dummy. No substantial enrichment of aerosols and CO2 was found at adjacent seats, provided that (1) there were floor displacement outlets under each seat enabling a minimum local fresh air vertical flow of vv = 0.05 m/s, (2) the air exchange rate (ACH) was more than 3, and (3) the dummy wore a surgical face mask. Knowledge of dispersion of viral droplets by airborne routes in real environments will help in risk assessment when re-opening concert halls and theatres after a pandemic lockdown.","Schade, Wolfgang; Reimer, Vladislav; Seipenbusch, Martin; Willer, Ulrike; Hübner, Eike G",Int J Infect Dis,,217
448509,Supporting our Fellows and Members through COVID-19,2020,"PURPOSE: While fever may be a presenting symptom of COVID-19, fever at hospital admission has not been identified as a predictor of mortality. However, hyperthermia during critical illness among ventilated COVID-19 patients in the ICU has not yet been studied. We sought to determine mortality predictors among ventilated COVID-19 ICU patients and we hypothesized that fever in the ICU is predictive of mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 103 ventilated COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU between March 14 and May 27, 2020. Final follow-up was June 5, 2020. Patients discharged from the ICU or who died were included. Patients still admitted to the ICU at final follow-up were excluded. RESULTS: 103 patients were included, 40 survived and 63(61.1%) died. Deceased patients were older {66 years[IQR18] vs 62.5[IQR10], (p = 0.0237)}, more often male {48(68%) vs 22(55%), (p = 0.0247)}, had lower initial oxygen saturation {86.0%[IQR18] vs 91.5%[IQR11.5], (p = 0.0060)}, and had lower pH nadir than survivors {7.10[IQR0.2] vs 7.30[IQR0.2] (p < 0.0001)}. Patients had higher peak temperatures during ICU stay as compared to hospital presentation {103.3°F[IQR1.7] vs 100.0°F[IQR3.5], (p < 0.0001)}. Deceased patients had higher peak ICU temperatures than survivors {103.6°F[IQR2.0] vs 102.9°F[IQR1.4], (p = 0.0008)}. Increasing peak temperatures were linearly associated with mortality. Febrile patients who underwent targeted temperature management to achieve normothermia did not have different outcomes than those not actively cooled. Multivariable analysis revealed 60% and 75% higher risk of mortality with peak temperature greater than 103°F and 104°F respectively; it also confirmed hyperthermia, age, male sex, and acidosis to be predictors of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the first studies to identify ICU hyperthermia as predictive of mortality in ventilated COVID-19 patients. Additional predictors included male sex, age, and acidosis. With COVID-19 cases increasing, identification of ICU mortality predictors is crucial to improve risk stratification, resource management, and patient outcomes.","Choron, Rachel L; Butts, Christopher A; Bargoud, Christopher; Krumrei, Nicole J; Teichman, Amanda L; Schroeder, Mary E; Bover Manderski, Michelle T; Cai, Jenny; Song, Cherry; Rodricks, Michael B; Lissauer, Matthew; Gupta, Rajan",J Intensive Care Med,,217

449761,Delivering WHO's Life-Saving Information in Real-Time During a Pandemic Through an Online Learning Platform: Evidence from Global Use,2021,"In these times of COVID-19 pandemic, concern has been raised about the potential effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on immunocompromised patients, particularly on those receiving B-cell depleting agents and having therefore a severely depressed humoral response. Convalescent plasma can be a therapeutic option for these patients. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of convalescent plasma is crucial to optimize such therapeutic approach. Here, we describe a COVID-19 patient who was deeply immunosuppressed following rituximab (anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody) and concomitant chemotherapy for chronic lymphoid leukemia. His long-term severe T and B cell lymphopenia allowed to evaluate the treatment effects of convalescent plasma. Therapeutic outcome was monitored at the clinical, biological and radiological level. Moreover, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers (IgM, IgG and IgA) and neutralizing activity were assessed over time before and after plasma transfusions, alongside to SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantification and virus isolation from the upper respiratory tract. Already after the first cycle of plasma transfusion, the patient experienced rapid improvement of pneumonia, inflammation and blood cell counts, which may be related to the immunomodulatory properties of plasma. Subsequently, the cumulative increase in anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies due to the three additional plasma transfusions was associated with progressive and finally complete viral clearance, resulting in full clinical recovery. In this case-report, administration of convalescent plasma revealed a stepwise effect with an initial and rapid anti-inflammatory activity followed by the progressive SARS-CoV-2 clearance. These data have potential implications for a more extended use of convalescent plasma and future monoclonal antibodies in the treatment of immunosuppressed COVID-19 patients.","Zimmerli, Aurelia; Monti, Matteo; Fenwick, Craig; Eckerle, Isabella; Beigelman-Aubry, Catherine; Pellaton, Céline; Jaton, Katia; Dumas, Dominique; Stamm, Gian-Marco; Infanti, Laura; Andreu-Ullrich, Heidrun; Germann, Daphné; Mean, Marie; Vollenweider, Peter; Stadelmann, Raphael; Prella, Maura; Comte, Denis; Guery, Benoit; Gachoud, David; Rufer, Nathalie",Front Immunol,,217
450864,Problematic technology use needs to be tackled so that children and adolescents can reap positive benefits during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Background: The fixed-dose combination of tenofovir (TDF), lamivudine (3TC), and dolutegravir (TLD) is now preferred first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) for most adults with HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa. Yet, concerns remain about durability of TLD with high circulating resistance to 3TC and TDF and metabolic abnormalities observed in clinical trials. Limited programmatic data are available to describe the success of the TLD transition in the region. Methods: We established the DISCO cohort to quantify viral suppression and regimen tolerability during the TLD transition. We prospectively enrolled adults from public clinics in Uganda and South Africa who had been on non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based ART for ≥6 months and were programmatically switched to TLD. We obtained demographics, medical history data, and plasma specimens at enrollment and week 24. We conducted retrospective HIV-1 RNA viral load (VL) testing using the Cepheid GeneXpert platform. Though both sites were interrupted by COVID-19, here we report complete week 24 results for the Uganda cohort. Results: We enrolled 500 participants (41% female) in Uganda. Median age was 47 years (IQR 40-53). Median ART duration was 8.8 years (IQR 5.7-12.2). The most common regimens prior to TLD switch were 3TC/TDF/efavirenz (44%) and 3TC/zidovudine/nevirapine (39%). Retrospective VL testing demonstrated that 95% (475/499) had VL &lt;50 copies/mL, 4% (19/499) had VL 50-1,000 copies/ mL, and 1% (5/499) had VL &gt;1,000 copies/mL at enrollment. 90% (448/500) completed week 24 visits, with 50 additional visits delayed during COVID-19, 1 disenrollment, and 1 death. By week 24, 1% (6/448) discontinued TLD due to side effects or clinician discretion. At week 24, 96% (432/448) had VL &lt;50 copies/mL, 3% (12/448) had VL 50-1,000 copies/mL, and 1% (4/448) had VL &gt;1,000 copies/mL. Of those with week 24 VL &gt;50 copies/mL, 31% (5/16) had detectable VL &gt;50 copies/mL at enrollment, versus 3% (15/431) in those with suppressed VL at week 24 (χ2 p-value&lt;0.001). Conclusion: The great majority of participants transitioned to TLD with an undetectable VL. Overall, we documented 86% suppression at week 24 after TLD switch in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic and 96% suppression in those completing a week 24 visit. These data support early tolerability and efficacy of TLD transition in the public sector. However, detectable VL at switch predicted detectable VL at 24 weeks. Vigilance and programmatic monitoring are needed to ensure long-term durability of TLD.","McCluskey, S.; Muyindike, W.; Omoding, D.; Masette, G.; Stuckwisch, A.; Hedt-Gauthier, B.; Marconi, V.; Moosa, M.

451042,Why children are less likely to contract COVID-19 infection than adults?,2020,"BACKGROUND: Access to comprehensive exercise and rehabilitation services for people with multiple sclerosis (MS) remains a major challenge, especially in rural, low-income areas. Hence, the Tele-Exercise and Multiple Sclerosis (TEAMS) study aims to provide patient-centered, coordinated care by implementing a 12-week complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) intervention for adults with MS. However, due to the societal impact of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in mid-March 2020, the University of Alabama at Birmingham announced a limited business model halting all nonessential research requiring on-site visits, which includes the TEAMS study. OBJECTIVE: In compliance with the shelter-in-place policy and quarantine guidance, a modified testing and training protocol was developed to allow participants to continue the study. METHODS: The modified protocol, which replaces on-site data collection and training procedures, includes a teleassessment package (computer tablet, blood pressure cuff, hand dynamometer, mini disc cone, measuring tape, an 8"" step, and a large-print 8"" × 11"" paper with ruler metrics and wall-safe tape) and a virtual meeting platform for synchronous interactive training between the therapist and the participant. The teleassessment measures include resting blood pressure and heart rate, grip strength, Five Times Sit to Stand, Timed Up & Go, and the Berg Balance Scale. The teletraining component includes 20 sessions of synchronous training sessions of dual tasking, yoga, and Pilates exercises designed and customized for a range of functional levels. Teletraining lasts 12 weeks and participants are instructed to continue exercising for a posttraining period of 9 months. RESULTS: The protocol modifications were supported with supplemental funding (from the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute) and approved by the University Institutional Review Board for Human Use. At the time nonessential research visits were halted by the university, there were 759 people enrolled and baseline tested, accounting for 92.5% of our baseline testing completion target (N=820). Specifically, 325 participants completed the 12-week intervention and follow-up testing visits, and 289 participants needed to complete either the intervention or follow-up assessments. A modified analysis plan will include sensitivity analyses to ensure the robustness of the study results in the presence of uncertainty and protocol deviations. Study results are projected to be published in 2021. CONCLUSIONS: This modified remote teleassessment/teletraining protocol will impact a large number of participants with MS who would otherwise have been discontinued from the study.

However, the molecular mechanisms of Cg-induced inflammation are not fully elucidated. The present study aimed to investigate the molecular basis involved in Cg-induced macrophages activation and cytokines production. METHODS: Primary culture of mouse peritoneal macrophages were stimulated with Kappa Cg. The supernatant and cell lysate were used for ELISA, western blotting, immunofluorescence. Cg-induced mouse colitis was also developed. RESULTS: Here we show that Cg activates peritoneal macrophages to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IL-1ß. While Cg-induced TNF production/secretion depends on TLR4/MyD88 signaling, the production of pro-IL-1ß relies on TLR4/TRIF/SYK/reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling pathway. The maturation of pro-IL1ß into IL-1ß is dependent on canonical NLRP3 inflammasome activation via Pannexin-1/P2X7/K+ efflux signaling. In vivo, Cg-induced colitis was reduced in mice in the absence of NLRP3 inflammasome components. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we unravel a critical role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in Cg-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines production and colitis, which is an important discovery on the pro-inflammatory properties of this sulfated polysaccharide for pre-clinical studies. Video abstract Carrageenan (Cg) is one the most used flogistic stimulus in preclinical studies. Nevertheless, the molecular basis of Cg-induced inflammation is not totally elucidated.

455628,Telemedicine and COVID-19: beyond just virtual consultations - the Singapore experience,2020,"Background: The Saudi Ministry of Health (MOH) has published detailed guidelines and educational documents about Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) prevention and infection control. The knowledge of dentists of the reported guidelines is not yet assessed and lack of awareness of these guidelines may have negative implications on dental patients. Aims: The aim of this study is to assess the knowledge of dentists about COVID-19 and the MOH guidelines while treating dental patients in Saudi Arabia. Materials and Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online survey which was sent to a sample of dentists in Saudi Arabia from March to May 2020. Results: A total of 294 dentists with a mean age of (36.9 ± 10.6) years completed the questionnaire. Participants included 157 females and 137 males with a range of professional classification and experience. All of the participants were aware of COVID-19, the nature of the disease, symptoms, modes of transmission and people at higher risk, except for 7.2% who did not report the correct incubation period. All participants agreed that patients and staff should wear a facial mask, use hydroalcoholic hand sanitizer upon arrival. Only 72.4% had knowledge about published guidelines. Infection control training was provided for 53% of the participants and those who had training were more confident to treat patients. Regarding personal protective equipment (PPE), putting on and taking off PPE, 64.6% and 78.6%, respectively, were aware of the guidelines. Conclusion: Dentists in Saudi Arabia had optimal knowledge about COVID-19. However, infection control training is recommended to increase readiness and confidence among dentists.","Nassar, Afnan A",Niger J Clin Pract,,217
455862,The impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on elective paediatric otolaryngology outpatient services - An analysis of virtual outpatient clinics in a tertiary referral centre using the modified paediatric otolaryngology telemedicine satisfaction survey (POTSS),2020,"Coronavirus has attracted a lot of attention due to its ability to cause fatal zoonotic infections. These are the zoonotic viruses of both medical and veterinary importance. The virus spread through respiratory droplets and causes diseases, ranging from colds to more serious illnesses: Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, Severe Respiratory Syndrome, and Severe Respiratory Syndrome 2. The prevalence rate is high during winter and spring. Genomes of coronaviruses have large enveloped +RNA. First human corona viruses, causing respiratory diseases, were identified in 1960s, but they were not considered highly pathogenic to humans until severe respiratory syndrome broke out in China during 2003. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, and novel Corona Virus Disease (nCOVID-19) or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-2 have increased the interest in this viral family. The Coronavirus-19 is a novel strain that was recently discovered in Wuhan (China) in December 2019. Studies revealed that reservoir of all the three fatal coronaviruses was bat with variation in the intermediate host i.e. civet cats for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, dromedary camel for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome and bat or pangolin for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2. Numerous well-known corona viruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans, while previously identified viruses could only be the tip of the iceberg, possibly with more novel and severe zoonotic events unfolding. Coronaviruses can be controlled with the global community's special attention and prophylaxis.

456819,Reply to: Say What?! Ableist Logic Used in Misguided Attempt to Combat Ageism During COVID-19,2020,"INTRODUÇÃO: O coronavírus da Síndrome Respiratória Aguda Grave 2 (abreviado para SARSCoV-2, do inglês Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2), anteriormente conhecido como novo coronavírus (2019-nCoV), é um agente zoonótico recémemergente que surgiu em dezembro de 2019, em Wuhan, China, causando manifestações respiratórias, digestivas e sistêmicas, que se articulam no quadro clínico da doença denominada COVID-19 (do inglês Coronavirus Disease 2019) Ainda não há informações robustas sobre a história natural da doença, tampouco sobre as medidas de efetividade para o manejo clínico dos casos de infecção pelo COVID19, restando ainda muitos detalhes a serem esclarecidos No entanto, sabe-se que o vírus tem alta transmissibilidade e provoca uma síndrome respiratória aguda que varia de casos leves ­ cerca de 80% ­ a casos muito graves com insuficiência respiratória - entre 5% e 10% dos casos ­, os quais requerem tratamento especializado em unidades de terapia intensiva (UTI) Sua letalidade varia, principalmente, conforme a faixa etária TECNOLOGIA: Os testes de diagnóstico para a COVID-19 se destacaram na pandemia de coronavírus em andamento como uma ferramenta essencial para rastrear a propagação da doença Uma ampla gama de testes diagnósticos para o SARS-CoV-2 está disponível comercialmente, alguns dos quais receberam autorizações para uso por várias agências reguladoras nacionais Com as informações da sequência genética devidamente identificadas, os testes de diagnóstico baseados na detecção da sequência viral por reação em cadeia da polimerase com transcriptase reversa (RT-PCR) ou plataformas de sequenciamento logo se tornaram disponíveis Isso permitiu a confirmação do diagnóstico e melhores estimativas da atividade da infecção, que vêm aumentando em velocidades alarmantes Para a detecção mais sensível de SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV e SARS-CoV-2, recomendavam-se a coleta e o teste de amostras respiratórias superiores e inferiores O diagnóstico de casos suspeitos era confirmado por testes de RNA com RT-PCR em tempo real ou sequenciamento de próxima geração Foi demonstrado que o RNA viral poderia ser detectado a partir do swab nasal e faríngeo, lavagem broncoalveolar e plasma sanguíneo usando RT-PCR direcionado ao gene do vírus (5) O padrão-ouro para diagnóstico laboratorial da COVID-19 é a reação da transcriptase reversa, seguida de reação em cadeia da polimerase (RT-PCR) para amostras coletadas no trato respiratório superior ou inferior OBJETIVO: O objetivo deste relatório é analisar a acurácia dos testes diagnósticos registrados na Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária (ANVISA) até a presente data METODOLOGIA: foi realizada uma busca por diagnósticos para COVID-19 com registros vigentes na ANVISA Para tal, foram utilizados os termos &quot;COVID 19&quot;, SARS e coronavírus no campo de consulta de registro de produtos para saúde no site da Agência (https://consultas anvisa gov br/#/saude/) Os passos para acesso ao banco de dados de produtos diagnósticos na ANVISA são: 1) consulta produtos;2) consulta a banco de dados;3) produtos para a saúde e 4) pesquisa de produtos para a saúde registrados CONCLUSÕES: A ANVISA já avaliou mais de 120 pedidos de registro de produtos para testagens relacionadas à COVID-19 desde o dia 18 de março A maior parte das petições aguarda complementação de informações por parte das empresas e outras estão sendo analisadas com prioridade O tempo médio para avaliação dos registros na ANVISA gira em torno de 15 dias Atualmente, mais da metade dos registros concedidos diz respeito a testes rápidos para anticorpos Até a presente data, foram registrados 64 testes para diagnóstico da COVID-19, sendo 15 deles moleculares O teste de polymerase chain reaction em tempo real (RT-PCR) para identificação de SARS-CoV-2 é um teste de elevada sensibilidade e especificidade, ainda que os doentes com maior carga viral possam ter maior probabilidade de um teste positivo Os testes moleculares baseados em RNA exigem instalações laboratoriais específicas com níveis restritos de biossegurança e técnica A sensibilidade e especificidade dos testes sorológicos variaram entre os fabricantes É importante destacar que uma baixa sensibilidade do teste diagnóstico pode resultar em uma maior probabilidade de detectar falsos-negativos, o que poderia interferir principalmente em casos de indivíduos assintomáticos Em geral, a sensibilidade dos testes foi superior a 85% e a especificidade, superior a 94% Os testes sorológicos medem a quantidade de dois anticorpos (IgG e IgM) que o organismo produz quando entra em contato com um invasor Contudo, o desenvolvimento da resposta de um anticorpo à infecção pode ser dependente do hospedeiro e levar tempo No caso de SARS-CoV-2, estudos iniciais sugerem que a maioria dos pacientes se converte entre 7 e 11 dias após a exposição ao vírus, embora alguns pacientes possam desenvolver anticorpos mais cedo Devido a esse atraso natural, o teste de anticorpos pode não ser útil no cenário de uma doença aguda (11) Os testes de anticorpos para SARS-CoV-2 podem facilitar (i) o rastreamento de contatos (os testes baseados em RNA também podem ajudar);(ii) a vigilância sorológica nos níveis local, regional, estadual e nacional;e (iii) a identificação de quem já teve contato com o vírus e, portanto, pode (se houver imunidade protetora) ser imune (11,12) Alguns conjuntos de reagentes para testes sorológicos foram autorizados pela ANVISA em caráter emergencial devido à gravidade da situação e à necessidade de ampliar a testagem da população, mas a validação desses reagentes pelos laboratórios é fundamental, uma vez que poucos trabalhos conseguiram ser publicados até o momento As aprovações estão de acordo com a Resolução da Diretoria Colegiada (RDC) 348/2020, que define os critérios e os procedimentos extraordinários e temporários para tratamento de petições de registro de medicamentos, produtos biológicos e produtos para diagnóstico in vitro, e mudança pós-registro de medicamentos e produtos biológicos em virtude da emergência de saúde pública internacional decorrente do novo coronavírus Na RDC, para registro de testes diagnósticos, a ausência de qualquer estudo de desempenho ou restrição de dados deve ser justificada por motivações técnicas que permitam a avalição da confiabilidade dos resultados e da efetividade diagnóstica do produto Os registros concedidos nas condições dessa Resolução terão a validade de um ano, exceto para situações em que a avaliação da estabilidade seja apresentada por comparação com produtos similares e os demais critérios descritos no Regulamento sejam atendidos Nesse caso, poderão ter a concessão regular de validade de registro de produtos para saúde por um período de 10 anos Em resumo, as duas categorias de testes para SARS-CoV-2 podem ser úteis nesse surto, pois, eventualmente, a coleta de múltiplas amostras, regiões e em tempos diferentes durante a evolução da doença pode ser necessária para o diagnóstico da COVID-19","Saúde, Brasil.

457652,"WITHDRAWN: COVID-19 related acute decline in paediatric admissions in Malta, a population-based study",2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic requires massive and rapid behavior change. The Health Action Process Approach (HAPA) describes personal determinants that play a key role in behavior change. This study investigated whether these determinants are associated with adherence to physical distancing measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 (i.e. keeping 1.5 m physical distance and staying at home). Decreased psychosocial well-being and lack of social support were explored as barriers to adherence. METHODS: Two cross-sectional surveys were conducted among adults in Belgium. The first survey (N = 2,379; March 2020) focused on adherence to physical distancing measures. The second survey (N = 805; April 2020) focused on difficulty with, and perseverance in, adhering to these measures. Linear regression models were fitted to examine associations with HAPA determinants, psychosocial well-being, and social support. RESULTS: Self-efficacy, outcome expectancies, intention, action planning, and coping planning were related to adhering to, difficulty with, and perseverance in, adhering to physical distancing measures. Decreased psychosocial well-being and lack of social support were related to more difficulties with adhering to physical distancing and lower perseverance. CONCLUSIONS: Health action process approach determinants are associated with adherence to physical distancing measures. Future work could design HAPA-based interventions to support people in adhering to these measures.","Beeckman, Melanie; De Paepe, Annick; Van Alboom, Maité; Maes, Sarah; Wauters, Aline; Baert, Fleur; Kissi, Ama; Veirman, Elke; Van Ryckeghem, Dimitri M L; Poppe, Louise",Appl Psychol Health Well Being,,217

Differentiating a new-onset EGPA from COVID-19 during the current pandemic is a diagnostic challenge, particularly if other EGPA symptoms are overlooked. Here in this study we reviewed the literature regarding EGPA patients with COVID-19 and patients who diagnosed with EGPA or suffered an EGPA flare mimicking COVID-19. We conducted a literature survey in PUBMED database using meshed keywords ""COVID-19"" and ""EGPA"", ""COVID-19"" and ""eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis"", ""COVID-19"" and ""Churg Strauss Syndrome"", to reveal previously reported cases involving EGPA patients who had COVID-19 infection, patients who suspected to have COVID-19 but eventually diagnosed with EGPA and patients with a known diagnosis of EGPA who suffered a flare but a COVID-19 infection was suspected initially. A total of 11 cases (6 literature cases, 5 cases from our clinic) were included in our study. Seven (63.6%) of the cases were defined as COVID-19 mimicker and 4 (36.4%) were EGPA with COVID-19. All of the cases in EGPA with COVID-19 group had a history of asthma. All of them had a positive PCR result and ground-glass opacities in thorax CT. In COVID-19 mimicker group, six (85.7%) patients had a history of asthma and other EGPA features that were observed were eosinophilia in 6 (85.7%). Our study provided clues regarding the EGPA/COVID-19 diagnostic challenge which may be useful in the current pandemic. Since none of the findings in COVID-19 are disease-specific, other conditions like EGPA should not be overlooked particularly in PCR negative patients and clinical, laboratory and imaging findings should be interpreted carefully. Furthermore, we did not observe poor outcomes in EGPA patients who had COVID-19.","Özdemir, Bahar; Erden, Abdulsamet; Güven, Serdar Can; Armagan, Berkan; Apaydin, Hakan; Karakas, Özlem; Akdag, Ahmet Gokhan; Ates, Ihsan; Kucuksahin, Orhan; Omma, Ahmet",Rheumatol Int,,217

The model employs Monte Carlo simulations of viral spread sample paths in the contact network. The original motivation was to detect COVID-19 outbreaks quickly in such facilities, but the model can be applied to any communicable disease. In particular, the model provides guidance on how many test to administer each day and on the importance of the testing order among staff or workers.","Ding, Yanyue; Agrawal, Sudesh K.; Cao, Jincheng; Meyers, Lauren; Hasenbein, John J.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.00170v1.pdf,217

463488,Prevalent fears and inadequate understanding of COVID-19 among medical undergraduates in India: results of a web-based survey,2020,"BACKGROUND: Ascertaining preferences for SARS-CoV-2 testing and incorporating findings into the design and implementation of strategies for delivering testing services may enhance testing uptake and engagement, a prerequisite to reducing onward transmission. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine important drivers of decisions to obtain a SARS-CoV-2 test in the context of increasing community transmission. METHODS: We used a discrete choice experiment to assess preferences for SARS-CoV-2 test type, specimen type, testing venue, and results turnaround time. Participants (n=4793) from the US national longitudinal Communities, Households and SARS-CoV-2 Epidemiology (CHASING) COVID Cohort Study completed our online survey from July 30 to September 8, 2020. We estimated the relative importance of testing method attributes and part-worth utilities of attribute levels, and simulated the uptake of an optimized testing scenario relative to the current typical testing scenario of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) via nasopharyngeal swab in a provider's office or urgent care clinic with results in >5 days. RESULTS: Test result turnaround time had the highest relative importance (30.4%), followed by test type (28.3%), specimen type (26.2%), and venue (15.0%). In simulations, immediate or same-day test results, both PCR and serology, or oral specimens substantially increased testing uptake over the current typical testing option. Simulated uptake of a hypothetical testing scenario of PCR and serology via a saliva sample at a pharmacy with same-day results was 97.7%, compared to 0.6% for the current typical testing scenario, with 1.8% opting for no test. CONCLUSIONS: Testing strategies that offer both PCR and serology with noninvasive methods and rapid turnaround time would likely have the most uptake and engagement among residents in communities with increasing community transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","Zimba, Rebecca; Kulkarni, Sarah; Berry, Amanda; You, William; Mirzayi, Chloe; Westmoreland, Drew; Parcesepe, Angela; Waldron, Levi; Rane, Madhura; Kochhar, Shivani; Robertson, McKaylee; Maroko, Andrew; Grov, Christian; Nash, Denis",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,217

Therefore, identifying the primary sources of COVID-19 information among older adults can be valuable, as it can enable information on life-saving measures to be effectively disseminated to this population. METHODS: We analyzed the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey COVID-19 Supplement that was administrated from June 2020 through July 2020 (n=8,050). A survey-weighted logistic model was conducted to examine the association between sources of COVID-19 information Medicare beneficiaries most relied on (i.e., traditional news sources, social media, comments/guidance from government officials, other webpages/internet, friends/family members, and health care providers) and engaging in all three recommended preventive behaviors (i.e., mask wearing, social distancing, and handwashing). RESULTS: Among study participants, 89.8% engaged in all three recommended preventive behaviors. Approximately 59.3% of beneficiaries reported that they most relied upon traditional news sources for COVID-19 information; 11.4% reported health care providers; 10.6% reported comments/guidance from government officials; 8.8% reported other webpages/internet, 8.6% reported friends/family members; and 1.3% reported they relied upon social media. Beneficiaries who relied on comments/guidance from government officials for COVID-19 information (vs. traditional news sources) were more likely to engage in preventive behaviors (OR=1.68, 95% CI=1.20,2.35). However, those who relied on COVID-19 information from friends/family members (vs. traditional news sources) were less likely to engage in preventive behaviors (OR=0.56, 95% CI=0.44,0.73). DISCUSSION: Our findings can inform decision making about the effective communication sources to reach Medicare beneficiaries for public health messaging regarding preventive measures, including COVID-19 vaccination.","Ng, Boon Peng; Park, Chanhyun",,,217

As part of the efforts to discover lead compounds for clinical use, 53 molecules were screened using molecular docking and dynamic simulations (MDS) techniques to identify potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (COVID-19 Sgp) and main protease (COVID-19 Mpro) or both. Lopinavir (LPV), nelfinavir (NEF), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), remdesivir (RDV) and an irreversible inhibitor of SARS-CoV (N3) were used as standard drugs for COVID-19 Mpro, while zafirlukast (ZFK) and cefoperazone (CSP)) as standard drugs for COVID-19 Sgp. After 100 ns of MDS, with reference to standard drugs (N3, -52.463 Kcal/mol, NEF, -51.618 Kcal/mol, RDV, -48.780 Kcal/mol, LPV, -46.788 Kcal/mol, DRV, -33.655 Kcal/mol and HCQ, -21.065 Kcal/mol), five molecules, HCR, GRN, C3G, EGCG, and K7G were predicted to be promising inhibitors of COVID-19 Mpro with binding energies of -53.877 kcal/mol, -50.653 Kcal/mol, -48.600 kcal/mol, -47.798 kcal/mol and -46.902 kcal/mol, respectively. These lead molecules were then docked at receptor-binding domain (RBD) of COVID-19 Sgp to examine their inhibitory effects. C3G, GRN and K7G exhibited higher binding energies of -42.310 kcal/mol, -32.210 kcal/mol, -26.922 kcal/mol than the recorded values for the reference drugs (CSP, -35.509 kcal/mol, ZFK, -24.242 kcal/mol), respectively. The results of the binding energy and structural analyses from this study revealed that C3G, GRN and K7G could serve as potential dual inhibitors of COVID-19 Sgp and COVID-19 Mpro, while HCR and EGCG would be inhibitors of COVID-19 Mpro.

468239,Lessons learned: Contribution to healthcare by medical students during COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: In the days of the reorganization of healthcare systems due to SARS-Cov2 pandemic, patients suffering from chronic diseases are being often neglected. The aim of our study was to examine the attitudes and behaviors of patient suffering from relapsing-remitting form of multiple sclerosis using disease-modifying drugs in Montenegro in relation to the current pandemic. METHODS: The research was conducted through an online-generated questionnaire during the peak of the pandemic. RESULTS: There is a high level of concern about COVID-19 (3.22±1.23), especially about safety behavior intensification (3.80±1.29). Possibility of relapse during pandemic was considered as moderate (2.06±1.42), but relapse symptoms would be reported by the majority of subjects (1.55±1.23). Our unemployed patients statistically more often reported that they had more frequent mood changes, but also that they felt more energy loss. Surprisingly, there was no difference among the subjects according to smoking status. According therapy groups there was significant difference between the groups regarding some variables: patients using ocrelizumab are most concerned about COVID-19; patients using interferon beta 1a i.m. statistically more often have frequent changes in their mood, memory problems, poor appetite, feeling of nausea or upset stomach and patients on fingolimod have bigger afraid of coming to regular visits. CONCLUSION: Our patients showed concern about their disease future status in the current epidemic era, but also showed a high degree of trust in physicians and the overall health system.","Radulovic, Ljiljana; Erakovic, Jevto; Roganovic, Milovan",Mult Scler Relat Disord,,217

Data are needed on the comparative safety, reactogenicity, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) effects of these vaccines. Objective: To compare safety, reactogenicity, and changes in HRQOL scores after aIIV3 vs HD-IIV3. Design, Setting, and Participants: This randomized blinded clinical trial was a multicenter US study conducted during the 2017 to 2018 and 2018 to 2019 influenza seasons. Among 778 community-dwelling adults aged at least 65 years and assessed for eligibility, 13 were ineligible and 8 withdrew before randomization. Statistical analysis was performed from August 2019 to August 2020. Interventions: Intramuscular administration of aIIV3 or HD-IIV3 after age-stratification (65-79 years; &#8805;80 years) and randomization. Main Outcomes and Measures: Proportions of participants with moderate-to-severe injection-site pain and 14 other solicited reactions during days 1 to 8, using a noninferiority test (5% noninferiority margin), and serious adverse events (SAE) and adverse events of clinical interest (AECI), including new-onset immune-mediated conditions, during days 1 to 43. Changes in HRQOL scores before and after vaccination (days 1, 3) were also compared between study groups. Results: A total of 757 adults were randomized, 378 to receive aIIV3 and 379 to receive HD-IIV3. Of these participants, there were 420 women (55%) and 589 White individuals (78%) with a median (range) age of 72 (65-97) years. The proportion reporting moderate-to-severe injection-site pain, limiting or preventing activity, after aIIV3 (12 participants [3.2%]) (primary outcome) was noninferior compared with HD-IIV3 (22 participants [5.8%]) (difference -2.7%; 95% CI, -5.8 to 0.4). Ten reactions met noninferiority criteria for aIIV3; 4 (moderate-to-severe injection-site tenderness, arthralgia, fatigue, malaise) did not. It was inconclusive whether these 4 reactions occurred in higher proportions of participants after aIIV3. No participant sought medical care for a vaccine reaction. No AECI was observed. Nine participants had at least SAE after aIIV3 (2.4%; 95% CI,1.1% to 4.5%); 3 had at least 1 SAE after HD-IIV3 (0.8%; 95% CI, 0.2% to 2.2%). No SAE was associated with vaccination. Changes in prevaccination and postvaccination HRQOL scores were not clinically meaningful and not different between the groups. Conclusions and Relevance: Overall safety and HRQOL findings were similar after aIIV3 and HD-IIV3, and consistent with prelicensure data. From a safety standpoint, this study's results support using either vaccine to prevent influenza in older adults.

There has been a failure to develop effective treatment for this tumor. Using a combined RNAi and chemical screen targeting epigenomic regulators, we identify the polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) component BMI1 as a critical factor for DIPG tumor maintenance in vivo. BMI1 chromatin occupancy is enriched at genes associated with differentiation and tumor suppressors in DIPG cells. Inhibition of BMI1 decreases cell self-renewal and attenuates tumor growth due to induction of senescence. Prolonged BMI1 inhibition induces a senescence-associated secretory phenotype, which promotes tumor recurrence. Clearance of senescent cells using BH3 protein mimetics co-operates with BMI1 inhibition to enhance tumor cell killing in vivo.","Balakrishnan, Ilango; Danis, Etienne; Pierce, Angela; Madhavan, Krishna; Wang, Dong; Dahl, Nathan; Sanford, Bridget; Birks, Diane K; Davidson, Nate; Metselaar, Dennis S; Meel, Michaël Hananja; Lemma, Rakeb; Donson, Andrew; Vijmasi, Trinka; Katagi, Hiroaki; Sola, Ismail; Fosmire, Susan; Alimova, Irina; Steiner, Jenna; Gilani, Ahmed; Hulleman, Esther; Serkova, Natalie J; Hashizume, Rintaro; Hawkins, Cynthia; Carcaboso, Angel M; Gupta, Nalin; Monje, Michelle; Jabado, Nada; Jones, Kenneth; Foreman, Nicholas; Green, Adam; Vibhakar, Rajeev; Venkataraman, Sujatha",Cell Rep,,217

In this review, an overview of popular biomaterials as drug delivery systems for neurogenerative diseases is provided, balancing the potential and challenges associated with the CNS drug delivery. As an effective drug delivery system, desired properties of biomaterials are discussed, addressing the persistent challenges such as targeted drug delivery, stimuli responsiveness, and controlled drug release in vivo. Finally, we discuss the prospects and limitations of incorporating extracellular vesicles (EVs) as a drug delivery system and their use for biocompatible, stable, and targeted delivery with limited immunogenicity, as well as their ability to be delivered via a non-invasive approach for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.","Kumar, Asit; Zhou, Lina; Zhi, Kaining; Raji, Babatunde; Pernell, Shelby; Tadrous, Erene; Kodidela, Sunitha; Nookala, Anantha; Kochat, Harry; Kumar, Santosh",Int. j. mol. sci.

471812,Improving Assessment of Demand for Postpartum Tubal Ligation among Publicly Insured Women in Texas,2021,"Plants adjust their architecture to a constantly changing environment, requiring adaptation of differential growth. Despite their importance, molecular switches, which define growth transitions, are largely unknown. Apical hook development in dark grown Arabidopsis thaliana (A. thaliana) seedlings serves as a suitable model for differential growth transition in plants. Here, we show that the phytohormone auxin counteracts the light-induced growth transition during apical hook opening. We, subsequently, identified genes which are inversely regulated by light and auxin. We used in silico analysis of the regulatory elements in this set of genes and subsequently used natural variation in gene expression to uncover correlations between underlying transcription factors and the in silico predicted target genes. This approach uncovered that MADS box transcription factor AGAMOUS-LIKE 8 (AGL8)/FRUITFULL (FUL) modulates apical hook opening. Our data shows that transient FUL expression represses the expression of growth stimulating genes during early phases of apical hook development and therewith guards the transition to growth promotion for apical hook opening. Here, we propose a role for FUL in setting tissue identity, thereby regulating differential growth during apical hook development.","Führer, Miriam; Gaidora, Angelika; Venhuizen, Peter; Dobrogojski, Jedrzej; Béziat, Chloé; Feraru, Mugurel I; Kleine-Vehn, Jürgen; Kalyna, Maria; Barbez, Elke",,,217

Aims: To further elucidate the possible role of vitamin D population status in the COVID-19 pandemic, we examined the associations between published representative and standardized population vitamin D data on European population vitamin D status and the Worldometer COVID-19 data. Methods: Data from the Worldometer on 26 European countries populated &amp;gt;4 million (M) were analyzed. Results: On 19-June-2020, linear regression found no correlation between published representative-standardized population vitamin-D concentrations and the total cases-recovered/M, but negative correlations predicting a reduction of 47-64-80% in serious-critical illnesses/M and of 61-82-102.4% in deaths/M, further enhanced when adapting for life expectancy by 133-177-221% if 25(OH)D concentrations reach 100-125-150 nmol/L.

Conclusions: Following the Endocrine Society’s expert committee recommendations, without previous testing being necessary, reaching and maintaining a serum 25(OH)D of 100–150 nmol/L (40–60 ng/ml) could be achieved by an initial supplementation with the upper tolerable daily intake doses (IU/day) for up to two months: &amp;lt;1yr 2000, 1-18yrs 4000 and all adults 10,000 (obese x 2–3 times more) and then with the maintenance proposed doses that do not require medical supervision, practically identical with the IOM’s upper tolerable limits: 1000 &amp;lt;6m, 1500 6m-1yr, 2500 1-3yrs, 3000 4-8yrs, and 4000 &amp;gt;8yrs, with adults and adolescents requiring 4000–5000 (obese x 2). Vitamin D may not prevent SARS-CoV-2 from spreading but may protect, without any risk of toxicity, from serious-critical illness and death from COVID-19 disease. While awaiting well-designed prospective studies, following the proposed approach, the gain for global public health and not only against SARS-CoV-2 may just prove invaluable.","Papadimitriou, Dimitrios T.; Vassaras, Alexandros K.; Holick, Michael F.",Journal of the Endocrine Society,,217
473854,Patient experience of telemedicine for headache care during the COVID-19 pandemic: An American Migraine Foundation survey study,2021,"BACKGROUND: The prognostic value of coagulation disorder in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients should be demonstrated. AIM: To investigate the abnormalities of coagulation parameters in the patients with COVID-19 and their prognostic values. METHODS: Consecutive patients admitted in the isolation ward of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 31 to February 5, 2020 with confirmed COVID-19 were included. The primary outcomes were death and survival as of March 11. Demographics, vital signs, comorbidities and laboratory tests were collected and compared between those who died and survivors. Logistic regression analysis for prognostic factors was performed. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to compare the estimated survival rate between patients with prolonged prothrombin time and normal prothrombin time. RESULTS: The total number of patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were enrolled was 213. The median age was 62 years, and 95 patients (44.6%) were men. Fifty-one patients were critical (23.9%), 79 patients were severe (37.1%) and 83 patients were moderate (39%). As of March 11, 2020, 99 patients were discharged (46.5%), 79 patients (37.1%) stayed in the hospital and 35 patients (16.2%) died. Median time to death was 6 (4-8) d, while median hospital stay was 32 (22-36) d in survivors (P < 0.001). More men (P = 0.002) and elderly patients (P < 0.001) were found in the group of those who died. The respiration rate at admission was higher in the group of those who died (P < 0.001). The incidences of hypertension (P = 0.028), cerebrovascular disease (P < 0.001), chronic kidney disease (P = 0.02) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P < 0.001) were higher in the group of those who died. Platelet count was decreased in the group of those who died (P = 0.002) whereas prothrombin time (P < 0.001), activated partial thromboplastin time (P = 0.033), concentration of D-dimer (P < 0.001) and fibrin degradation products (P < 0.001) were increased in the group of those who died. Prothrombin time [odds ratio (OR): 2.19, P = 0.004], respiration rate (OR: 1.223, P < 0.001), age (OR: 1.074, P < 0.001) and fibrin degradation products concentration (OR: 1.02, P = 0.014) were predictors of death. The survival rate was significantly lower in patients with prolonged prothrombin time compare to those with normal prothrombin time (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Prothrombin time, concentration of fibrin degradation products, respiration rate and age were predictive factors for clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients.","Wang, Lang; He, Wen-Bo; Yu, Xiao-Mei; Hu, Da-Long; Jiang, Hong",World J Clin Cases,,217

Current recommendations suggest mask usage solely during HCW contact with Covid-19 patients, namely plain medical mask for low-risk contacts and N95 for aerosol generating procedures. The distinction regarding the escalation of mask complexity depending on contact type is nevertheless based on plausible theoretical assumptions rather than hard evidence of a clear benefit. Conversely, we suggest that at least a plain mask should be used during all HCWs' contacts in healthcare facilities which constitute a highly probable but often overlooked means of SARS-CoV-2 transmission among HCWs.","Tsilingiris, Dimitrios; Papatheodoridi, Margarita; Kapelios, Chris J",Intern Emerg Med,,217
475540,Hesitancy of Arab Healthcare Workers towards COVID-19 Vaccination: A Large-Scale Multinational Study,2021,"In order to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, policymakers around the globe have increasingly invested in digital health technologies to support the ‘test, track and trace’ approach of containing the spread of the novel coronavirus. These technologies include mobile ‘contact tracing’ applications (apps), which can trace individuals likely to have come into contact with those who have reported symptoms or tested positive for the virus and request that they self-isolate. This paper takes a critical public health perspective that advocates for ‘genuine participation’ in public health interventions and emphasises the need to take citizen’s knowledge into account during public health decision-making. In doing so, it presents and discusses the findings of a UK interview study that explored public views on the possibility of using a COVID-19 contact-tracing app public health intervention at the time the United Kingdom (UK) Government announced their decision to develop such a technology. Findings illustrated interviewees’ range and degree of understandings, misconceptions, and concerns about the possibility of using an app. In particular, concerns about privacy and surveillance predominated. Interviewees associated these concerns much more broadly than health by identifying with pre-existent British national narratives associated with individual liberty and autonomy. In extending and contributing to ongoing sociological research with public health, we argue that understanding and responding to these matters is vital, and that our findings demonstrate the need for a forward-looking, anticipatory strategy for public engagement as part of the responsible innovation of the COVID-19 contact-tracing app in the UK.

476071,"Regulating drugs, medical devices, and diagnostic tests in the European Union: early lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic?",2020,"BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic increases the demand for postacute care in patients after a severe disease course. Various long-term sequelae are expected and rehabilitation medicine is challenged to support physical and cognitive recovery. AIM: We aimed to explore the dysfunctions and outcome of COVID-19 survivors after early postacute rehabilitation. DESIGN: Observational cohort study. METHODS: This study evaluated the postacute sequelae of patients hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 infection and analyzed rehabilitative outcomes of a subgroup of patients included in the prospective observational multicenter CovILD study. RESULTS: A total of 23 subjects discharged after severe to critical COVID-19 infection underwent an individualized, multiprofessional rehabilitation. At the start of postacute rehabilitation, impairment of pulmonary function (87%), symptoms related to postintensive care syndrome, and neuropsychological dysfunction (85%) were frequently found, whereas cardiac function appeared to be largely unaffected. Of interest, multi-disciplinary rehabilitation resulted in a significant improvement in lung function, as reflected by an increase of forced vital capacity (P=0.007) and forced expiratory volume in one second (P=0.014), total lung capacity (P=0.003), and diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (P=0.002). Accordingly, physical performance status significantly improved as reflected by a mean increase of six-minute walking distance by 176 (SD±137) meters. Contrarily, a considerable proportion of patients still had limited diffusion capacity (83%) or neurological symptoms including peripheral neuropathy at the end of rehabilitation. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals discharged after a severe course of COVID-19 frequently present with persisting physical and cognitive dysfunctions after hospital discharge. Those patients significantly benefit from multi-disciplinary inpatient rehabilitation. CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: Our data demonstrated the highly promising effects of early postacute rehabilitation in survivors of severe or critical COVID-19. This findings urge further prospective evaluations and may impact future treatment and rehabilitation strategies.","Puchner, Bernhard; Sahanic, Sabina; Kirchmair, Rudolf; Pizzini, Alex; Sonnweber, Bettina; Wöll, Ewald; Mühlbacher, Andreas; Garimorth, Katja; Dareb, Bernhard; Ehling, Rainer; Wenter, Johanna; Schneider, Sybille; Brenneis, Christian; Weiss, Günter; Tancevski, Ivan; Sonnweber, Thomas; Löffler-Ragg, Judith",Eur J Phys Rehabil Med,,217
476460,Letter to the Editor: Recommendations for the Care of Pediatric Orthopaedic Patients During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"The Covid-19 pandemic was a reminder of the importance of increasing connectivity amidst the accelerated rate of changes and disruptive events of our era. The need and the rationale for global citizenship education (GCED) were ever more emphasized by many educational organizations, including UNESCO. This article reviews the GCED discourses conceptualizing global competence as instrumental action and a binary view of global-local relations. In turn, the article proposes the idea of curriculum-as-relations for GCED. Curriculum-as-relations conceptualizes competence as situated praxis and focuses on providing authentic critical-translocal learning. Authentic critical-translocal learning through the strategy of comparison offers an alternative view of global-local relations as ""articulated moments created by situated praxis"". This new understanding of global-local relations may help different stakeholders to imagine GCED curricula beyond a Tylerian instrumentalist, ends-means orientation of curriculum.","Kim, Eun-Ji Amy",Prospects (Paris),,217

476865,Outcome of trauma and orthopaedic surgery at a UK District General Hospital during the Covid-19 pandemic,2020,"COVID-19 has created a pandemic situation all over the world. It has spread in nearly every continent. Researchers all over the world are trying to produce an effective vaccine against this virus, however;no specific treatment for COVID-19 has been discovered -so far. The current work describes the inhibition study of the SARS-CoV-2 main proteinase or 3CL Mpro by natural and synthetic inhibitors, which include 2S albumin and flocculating protein from Moringa oleifera (M. oleifera) and Suramin. Molecular Docking study was carried out using the programs like AutoDock 4.0, HADDOCK2.4, patchdock, pardock, and firedock. The global binding energy of Suramin, 2S albumin, and flocculating proteins were −41.96, −9.12, and −14.78 kJ/mol, respectively. The docking analysis indicates that all three inhibitors bind at the junction of domains II and III. The catalytic function of 3CL Mpro is dependent on its dimeric form, and the flexibility of domain III is considered important for this dimerization. Our study showed that all three inhibitors reduce this flexibility and restrict their motion. The decrease in flexibility of domain III was further confirmed by analysis coming from Molecular dynamic simulation. The analysis results indicate that the temperature B-factor of the enzyme decreases tremendously when the inhibitors bind to it. This study will further explore the possibility of producing an effective treatment against COVID-19. © Copyright © 2021 Ullah and Ullah.","Ullah, A.; Ullah, K.",Frontiers in Molecular Biosciences,,217

480613,Covid-19 changes to maternity care: Experiences of Australian doctors,2021,"Drug-induced long QT syndrome (LQTS) is an established cardiac side effect of a wide range of medications and represents a significant concern for drug safety. The rapidly and slowly activating delayed rectifier K+ currents, mediated by channels encoded by the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) and KCNQ1 + KCNE1, respectively, are two main currents responsible for ventricular repolarization. The common cause for drugs to induce LQTS is through impairing the hERG channel. For the recent emergence of COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, several drugs have been investigated as potential therapies; however, there are concerns about their QT prolongation risk. Here, we studied the effects of chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and remdesivir on hERG channels. Our results showed that although chloroquine acutely blocked hERG current (IhERG), with an IC50 of 3.0 µM, hydroxychloroquine acutely blocked IhERG 8-fold less potently, with an IC50 of 23.4 µM. Azithromycin and remdesivir did not acutely affect IhERG When these drugs were added at 10 µM to the cell culture medium for 24 hours, remdesivir increased IhERG by 2-fold, which was associated with an increased mature hERG channel expression. In addition, these four drugs did not acutely or chronically affect KCNQ1 + KCNE1 channels. Our data provide insight into COVID-19 drug-associated LQTS and cardiac safety concerns. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This work demonstrates that, among off-label potential COVID-19 treatment drugs chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and remdesivir, the former two drugs block hERG potassium channels, whereas the latter two drugs do not. All four drugs do not affect KCNQ1 + KCNE1. As hERG and KCNQ1 + KCNE1 are two main K+ channels responsible for ventricular repolarization, and most drugs that induce long QT syndrome (LQTS) do so by impairing hERG channels, these data provide insight into COVID-19 drug-associated LQTS and cardiac safety concerns.","Szendrey, Mark; Guo, Jun; Li, Wentao; Yang, Tonghua; Zhang, Shetuan",J Pharmacol Exp Ther,,217

As part of the growing public health response, the University of Arizona Student Aid for Field Epidemiology Response (SAFER) team was able to modify and increase case investigation efforts to assist local health departments. We outline the recommended logistical and management steps to include students in a public health response of this scope. METHODS: From April 1 through September 1, 2020, the SAFER team identified key components of a successful student team response: volunteer training, management that allows more senior students to manage newer students, adoption of case-management software, and use of an online survey platform for students to conduct interviews consistently and allow for data quality control and management. RESULTS: From April 1 through September 1, 2020, SAFER worked with 3 local health departments to complete 1910 COVID-19 case investigations through a virtual call center. A total of 233 volunteers and 46 hourly student workers and staff members were involved. As of September 2020, students were completing >150 interviews per week, including contact-tracing efforts. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Developing relationships between applied public health and academic programs can relieve the burden of low-risk, high-volume case investigations at local and state health departments. Furthermore, by establishing a virtual call center, health sciences faculty and students can volunteer remotely during a pandemic with no additional risk of infection.","Pogreba Brown, Kristen; Austhof, Erika; Rosa Hernández, Ayeisha M; McFadden, Caitlyn; Boyd, Kylie; Sharma, Jayati; Battaglia, Sarah; Shilen, Alexandra; Heslin, Kelly M",Public Health Rep,,217

483134,N95 Usage During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"OBJECTIVES: End-of-outbreak declarations are an important component of outbreak response because they indicate that public health and social interventions may be relaxed or lapsed. Our study aimed to assess end-of-outbreak probabilities for clusters of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases detected during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. METHODS: A statistical model for end-of-outbreak determination, which accounted for reporting delays for new cases, was computed. Four clusters, representing different social contexts and time points during the first wave of the epidemic, were selected and their end-of-outbreak probabilities were evaluated. RESULTS: The speed of end-of-outbreak determination was most closely tied to outbreak size. Notably, accounting underascertainment of cases led to later end-of-outbreak determinations. In addition, end-of-outbreak determination was closely related to estimates of case dispersionk and the effective reproduction number Re. Increasing local transmission (Re>1) leads to greater uncertainty in the probability estimates. CONCLUSIONS: When public health measures are effective, lowerRe (less transmission on average) and larger k (lower risk of superspreading) will be in effect, and end-of-outbreak determinations can be declared with greater confidence. The application of end-of-outbreak probabilities can help distinguish between local extinction and low levels of transmission, and communicating these end-of-outbreak probabilities can help inform public health decision making with regard to the appropriate use of resources.","Linton, Natalie M; Akhmetzhanov, Andrei R; Nishiura, Hiroshi",Int J Infect Dis,,217

Age older than 45 years (hazard ratio, HR: 0.378; 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.205-0.698) and chest tightness (HR: 0.290; 95%CI: 0.091-0.919) were factors independently affecting negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Headache (odds ratio: 7.553; 95%CI: 1.011-28.253) was significantly associated with intermittent negative status, with a predicted probability of 60%. Older age and chest tightness were independently associated with delayed clearance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in hospitalized patients. These predictors would provide a new perspective on early identification of patients with prolonged viral shedding and facilitate optimal isolation protocols and treatment strategies.","Hu, Xiaowen; Xing, Yuhan; Jia, Jing; Ni, Wei; Liang, Jiwei; Zhao, Dan; Song, Xin; Gao, Ruqin; Jiang, Fachun",Sci Total Environ,,217

484102,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on anaesthesia trainees and their training,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Primary care physicians (PCPs) play a key role in responding to the COVID-19 epidemic. The objective of this study was to explore the influencing factors associated with self-reported psychological distress among a sample of PCPs in China in relation to COVID-19. METHODS: An online survey was distributed to a sample of PCPs in Chengdu city between February 10 and February 13, 2020. The survey consisted of three sections: demographic characteristics, COVID-19-related questions, and the General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12). After 5 months, a follow-up survey investigating the change of the GHQ-12 was conducted. RESULTS: A total of 712 PCPs completed the baseline survey (11.8% of those invited), 55.6% were female and 74.4% were aged between 30 and 49 years. High levels of psychological distress (GHQ-12 &#8805;3) were observed in 29.2% and were associated with low preparedness, high work impact, working with infected residents, personal life impact, and concerns, as well as older age and being married (p values < .05). Logistic regression analysis showed that psychological distress was associated with low preparedness (odds ratio [OR] = 0.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.87-0.96), high work impact (OR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.03-1.20), personal life impact (OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.07-1.17), and safety-related concerns (OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.02-1.16). At the 5-month assessment point, high psychological distress was less frequent (21.8%). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has resulted in high levels of distress in approximately 30% of PCPs in China. Factors associated with high psychological distress levels include low preparedness and high levels of work impact, personal life impact, and concerns. These findings highlight the importance of enhancing psychological health throughout the course of infectious pandemics.","Zeng, Xin; Peng, Tao; Hao, Xiaofei; Zou, Chuan; Lin, Kai; Liao, Xiaoyang; Chen, Shanping; Hayhoe, Benedict",Psychosom Med,,217

484517,"What doubts, concerns and fears about COVID-19 emerged during the first wave of the pandemic?",2020,"BACKGROUND: During the intense periods of the Covid-19 pandemic, legal measures were taken for its containment. However, since legal precautions cannot be implemented continuously, hand washing, mask usage and obeying social distance rules are important in combating the pandemic. Complying with these rules is mostly individual decisions. The behavior of individuals has a prominent place in the course of the pandemic. In this study, we aimed to develop a scale which could measure compliance with outbreak measures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was conducted in two stages after evaluation of the content validity of the item pool formed by the research group by experts. For construct validity, the scale sub-dimensions were determined in 250 people between the ages of 18-70 years at the first stage and the definitive version of the 20-item scale was constructed. In the second stage, exploratory factor analysis was repeated in a group of 484 people, and confirmatory factor analysis was performed. Cronbach?s alpha coefficients, Spearman-Brown coefficients, test-retest methods were used to determine reliability. RESULTS: The variance explanation of the scale consisting of 20 items and two sub-dimensions in the explanatory factor analysis is 63.434% (n = 484). Confirmatory factor analysis resulted in CMIN / DF = 3.540, RMR = 0.043, NFI Delta 1 = 0.928, TLI rho 2 = 0.939, CFI = 0.947, RMSEA = 0.072, SRMR = 0.0368. Cronbach's alpha value of the scale is 0.95; and The Spearman Brown Coefficient Equal Length analysis resulted in 0.928. The temporal consistency of the scale was evaluated with the test-retest method (p = 0.893). The structure, content validity, temporal consistency, item discrimination, and internal consistency were evaluated and found to have acceptable valid, reliable properties. CONCLUSION: The Outbreak Prevention Recommendation Compliance Scale is a valid and reliable tool with which compliance with the prevention plans can be evaluated.","KÖse, ElIf; Yazici, Esra; Yazici, Ahmet BÜlent; Aydin, AbdÜlkadIr; EkerbIÇer, Hasan ÇetIn; Karabay, OGuz",,,217

485747,Teleconsultation in primary ophthalmic emergencies during the COVID-19 lockdown in Paris: Patients' point of view,2021,"In the field of machine learning, building models and measuring their performance are two equally important tasks. Currently, measures of precision of regression models' predictions are usually based on the notion of mean error, where by error we mean a deviation of a prediction from an observation. However, these mean based measures of models' performance have two drawbacks. Firstly, they ignore the length of the prediction, which is crucial when dealing with chaotic systems, where a small deviation at the beginning grows exponentially with time. Secondly, these measures are not suitable in situations where a prediction is made for a specific point in time (e.g. a date), since they average all errors from the start of the prediction to its end. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to propose a new measure of models' prediction precision, a divergence exponent, based on the notion of the Lyapunov exponent which overcomes the aforementioned drawbacks. The proposed approach enables the measuring and comparison of models' prediction precision for time series with unequal length and a given target date in the framework of chaotic phenomena. Application of the divergence exponent to the evaluation of models' accuracy is demonstrated by two examples and then a set of selected predictions of COVID-19 spread from other studies is evaluated to show its potential.","Mazurek, Jirí",PLoS One,,217

485751,[Organization of a free mass distribution campaign of long-lasting insecticidal mosquito nets in the context of COVID-19 in Niger],2021,"The outbreak of COVID-19 coronavirus disease around the end of 2019 has become a pandemic. The preferred method for COVID-19 detection is the real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based technique; however, it also has certain limitations, such as sample-dependent procedures with a relatively high false negative ratio. We propose a safe and efficient method for screening COVID-19 based on Raman spectroscopy. A total of 177 serum samples are collected from 63 confirmed COVID-19 patients, 59 suspected cases, and 55 healthy individuals as a control group. Raman spectroscopy is adopted to analyze these samples, and a machine learning support-vector machine (SVM) method is applied to the spectrum dataset to build a diagnostic algorithm. Furthermore, 20 independent individuals, including 5 asymptomatic COVID-19 patients and 5 symptomatic COVID-19 patients, 5 suspected patients, and 5 healthy patients, were sampled for external validation. In these three groups-confirmed COVID-19, suspected, and healthy individuals-the distribution of statistically significant points of difference showed highly consistency for intergroups after repeated sampling processes. The classification accuracy between the COVID-19 cases and the suspected cases is 0.87 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.85-0.88), and the accuracy between the COVID-19 and the healthy controls is 0.90 (95% CI: 0.89-0.91), while the accuracy between the suspected cases and the healthy control group is 0.68 (95% CI: 0.67-0.73). For the independent test dataset, we apply the obtained SVM model to the classification of the independent test dataset to have all the results correctly classified. Our model showed that the serum-level classification results were all correct for independent test dataset. Our results suggest that Raman spectroscopy could be a safe and efficient technique for COVID-19 screening.","Yin, Gang; Li, Lintao; Lu, Shun; Yin, Yu; Su, Yuanzhang; Zeng, Yilan; Luo, Mei; Ma, Maohua; Zhou, Hongyan; Orlandini, Lucia; Yao, Dezhong; Liu, Gang; Lang, Jinyi",,,217
486321,Reply to: Comment on COVID-19 in Nursing Homes: Calming the Perfect Storm,2020,"Despite the large reduction in anthropogenic activities due to the outbreak of COVID-19, air quality in China has witnessed little improvement and featured great regional disparities. Here, by combining observational data and simulations, this work aims to understand the diverse air quality response in two city clusters, Yangtze River Delta region (YRD) and Pearl River Delta region (PRD), China. Though there was a noticeable drop in primary pollutants in both the regions, differently, the maximum daily 8 h average ozone (O3) soared by 20.6-76.8% in YRD but decreased by 15.5-28.1% in PRD. In YRD, nitrogen oxide (NOx) reductions enhanced O3 accumulation and hence increased secondary aerosol formation. Such an increment in secondary organic and inorganic aerosols under stationary weather reached up to 36.4 and 10.2%, respectively, which was further intensified by regional transport. PRD was quite the opposite. The emission reductions benefited PRD air quality, while regional transport corresponded to an increase of 17.3 and 9.3% in secondary organic and inorganic aerosols, respectively. Apart from meteorology, the discrepancy in O3-VOCs-NOx relationships determined the different O3 responses, indicating that future emission control shall be regionally specific, instead of one-size-fits-all cut. Overall, the importance of regionally coordinated and balanced control strategy for multiple pollutants is highly emphasized.","Wang, Nan; Xu, Jiawei; Pei, Chenglei; Tang, Rong; Zhou, Derong; Chen, Yanning; Li, Mei; Deng, Xuejiao; Deng, Tao; Huang, Xin; Ding, Aijun",Environ Sci Technol,,217

However, little is known about the difference in antibody responses induced by the two mRNA vaccines in naive and individuals with a previous history of infections (PI group). Therefore, we investigated the levels of anti-S-RBD total antibodies (IgM, IgA, and IgG), anti-S-RBD IgG, and anti-S-RBD IgA in these two groups 1-13 (median=6) weeks following administration of two doses of mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2 vaccines. Results showed that in naive-vaccinated group, the mRNA-1327 vaccine induces significantly higher levels of S-RBD total antibodies (3.5-fold; p<0.001), S-RBD IgG (2-fold-p<0.01), and S-IgA (2.1-fold, p<0.001) than the BNT162b2 vaccine. In the PI-vaccinated group, both vaccines produce significantly higher S-RBD total antibodies level than those of the naive-vaccinated group. The PI group produced a higher level of S-RBD IgG than the naive-BNT162b2 (p=0.05) but not more than the naive-mRNA-1273 (p=0.9) group. Interestingly, the PI-vaccinated group produced a comparable level of IgA ratio to the naive-mRNA-1273 group but significantly higher than the naive-BNT162b2 group (1.6-fold, p<0.001).

488817,COVID-19 lockdown impact on plastic surgery activity in the emergency department,2020,"OBJECTIVES: N95 filtering facepiece respirators (N95 FFRs) and surgical masks are comprised of multiple layers of nonwoven polypropylene. Tight-fitting N95 FFRs are respiratory protective devices (RPDs) designed to efficiently filter aerosols. During the COVID-19 pandemic, health care workers (HCWs) throughout the world continue to face shortages of disposable N95 FFRs. Existing version of widely available FDA cleared loose-fitting surgical masks with straps do not provide reliable protection against aerosols. We tested the faceseal of a modified strapless form-fitting sealed version of surgical mask using quantitative fit testing (QNFT) and compared the performance of this mask with that of N95 FFRs and unmodified loose-fitting surgical masks. METHODS: Twenty HCWs participated in the study (10 women; 10 men; age 23-59 years). To create the sealed surgical masks, we removed the straps from loose-fitting surgical masks, made new folds, and used adhesive medical tape to secure the new design. All participants underwent QNFT with a loose-fitting surgical mask, the sealed surgical mask, and an N95 FFR; fit factors were recorded. Each QNFT was performed using a protocol of four exercises: (i) bending over, (ii) talking, (iii) moving head side to side, and (iv) moving head up and down. When the overall fit factor for the sealed surgical mask or N95 FFR was <100, the participant retook the test. Participants scored the breathability and comfort of the sealed surgical mask and N95 FFR on a visual analog scale (VAS) ranging from 0 (unfavorable) to 10 (favorable). RESULTS: The median fit factor for the sealed surgical mask (53.8) was significantly higher than that of the loose-fitting surgical mask (3.0) but lower than that of the N95 FFR (177.0) (P < 0.001), equating to significantly lower inward leakage of ambient aerosols (measuring 0.04-0.06 µm) with the sealed surgical mask (geometric mean 1.79%; geometric standard deviation 1.45%; range 0.97-4.03%) than with the loose-fitting surgical mask (29.5%; 2.01%; 25-100.0%) but still higher than with the N95 FFR (0.66%; 1.46%; 0.50-1.97%) (P < 0.001). Sealed surgical masks led to a marked reduction (range 60-98%) in inward leakage of aerosols in all the participants, compared to loose-fitting surgical masks. Among the exercises, talking had a greater effect on reducing overall fit factor for the sealed surgical mask than for the N95 FFR; when talking was excluded, the fit factor for the sealed surgical mask improved significantly (median 53.8 to 81.5; P < 0.001). The sealed surgical mask, when compared with the N95 FFR, offered better reported breathability (median VAS 9 versus 5; P < 0.001) and comfort (9 versus 5; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Widely available loose-fitting surgical masks can be easily modified to achieve faceseal with adhesives. Unlike loose-fitting surgical masks, sealed surgical masks can markedly reduce inward leakage of aerosols and may therefore offer useful levels of respiratory protection during an extreme shortage of N95 FFRs and could benefit HCWs who cannot comply with N95 FFRs due to intolerance. However, because a wide range of surgical masks is commercially available, individual evaluation of such masks is highly recommended before sealed versions are used as RPDs.","Karuppasamy, Karunakaravel; Obuchowski, Nancy",Ann.

If not controlled, this ongoing pandemic can cause irreparable socio-economic and psychological impact worldwide. Therefore a safe and effective vaccine against COVID 19 is exigent. Recent advances in immunoinformatics approaches could potentially decline the attrition rate and accelerate the process of vaccine development in these unprecedented times. In the present study, a multivalent subunit vaccine targeting S2 subunit of the SARS-CoV2 S glycoprotein has been designed using open source, immunoinformatics tools. Designed construct comprises of epitopes capable of inducing T cell, B cell (Linear and discontinuous) and Interferon Î³. physiologically, vaccine construct is predicted to be thermostable, antigenic, immunogenic, non allergen and non toxic in nature. According to population coverage analysis, designed multiepitope vaccine covers 99.26% population globally. 3D structure of vaccine construct was designed, validated and refined to obtain high quality structure. Refined structure was docked against Toll like receptors to confirm the interactions between them. Vaccine peptide sequence was reverse transcribed, codon optimized and cloned in pET vector. Our in-silico study suggests that proposed vaccine against fusion domain of virus has the potential to elicit an innate as well as humoral immune response in human and restrict the entry of virus inside the cell.

489311,"Letter to the Editor: ""Investing in Teaching Research Skills to Residents in Neurosurgery During the COVID-19 Pandemic""",2021,"BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization has declared that infection with SARS-CoV-2 is a pandemic. Experiences with SARS in 2003 and SARS-CoV-2 have shown that health professionals are at higher risk of contracting COVID-19. Hence, it has been recommended that aperiodic wide-scale assessment of the knowledge and preparedness of health professionals regarding the current COVID-19 pandemic is critical. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the knowledge and preparedness of health professionals regarding COVID-19 among selected hospitals in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. METHODS: A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted from the last week of March to early April, 2020. Government (n = 6) and private hospitals (n = 4) were included. The front-line participants with high exposure were proportionally recruited from their departments. The collected data from a self-administered questionnaire were entered using EpiData and analyzed in SPSS software. Both descriptive statistics and inferential statistics (chi-square tests) are presented. RESULTS: A total of 1334 health professionals participated in the study. The majority (675, 50.7%) of the participants were female. Of the total, 532 (39.9%) subjects were nurses/midwives, followed by doctors (397, 29.8%) and pharmacists (193, 14.5%). Of these, one-third had received formal training on COVID-19. The mean knowledge score of participants was 16.45 (±4.4). Regarding knowledge about COVID-19, 783 (58.7%), 354 (26.5%), and 196 (14.7%) participants had moderate, good, and poor knowledge, respectively. Lower scores were seen in younger age groups, females, and non-physicians. Two-thirds (63.2%) of the subjects responded that they had been updated by their hospital on COVID-19. Of the total, 1020 (76.5%) participants responded that television, radio, and newspapers were their primary sources of information. Established hospital preparedness measures were confirmed by 43-57% of participants. CONCLUSION: The current study revealed that health professionals in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, already know important facts but had moderate overall knowledge about the COVID-19 pandemic.

490106,[Evaluation of incidence and risk profile for suffering Covid-19 infection by underlying conditions among middle-aged and older adults in Tarragona.],2020,"Since December 2019, COVID-19 has occurred unexpectedly and emerged as a health problem worldwide. Despite the rapidly increasing number of cases in subsequent weeks, the clinical characteristics of pediatric cases are rarely described. A cross-sectional multicenter study was carried out in 10 hospitals across Hubei province. A total of 25 confirmed pediatric cases of COVID-19 were collected. The demographic data, epidemiological history, underlying diseases, clinical manifestations, laboratory and radiological data, treatments, and outcomes were analyzed. Of 25 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the boy to girl ratio was 1.27:1. The median age was 3 years. COVID-19 cases in children aged <3 years, 3.6 years, and &#8805;6-years patients were 10 (40%), 6 (24%), and 9 (36%), respectively. The most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (13 [52%]), and dry cough (11 [44%]). Chest CT images showed essential normal in 8 cases (33.3%), unilateral involvement of lungs in 5 cases (20.8%), and bilateral involvement in 11 cases (45.8%). Clinical diagnoses included upper respiratory tract infection (n=8), mild pneumonia (n=15), and critical cases (n=2). Two critical cases (8%) were given invasive mechanical ventilation, corticosteroids, and immunoglobulin. The symptoms in 24 (96%) of 25 patients were alleviated and one patient had been discharged. It was concluded that children were susceptible to COVID-19 like adults, while the clinical presentations and outcomes were more favorable in children. However, children less than 3 years old accounted for majority cases and critical cases lied in this age group, which demanded extra attentions during home caring and hospitalization treatment.","Zheng, Fang; Liao, Chun; Fan, Qi-Hong; Chen, Hong-Bo; Zhao, Xue-Gong; Xie, Zhong-Guo; Li, Xi-Lin; Chen, Chun-Xi; Lu, Xiao-Xia; Liu, Zhi-Sheng; Lu, Wei; Chen, Chun-Bao; Jiao, Rong; Zhang, Ai-Ming; Wang, Jin-Tang; Ding, Xi-Wei; Zeng, Yao-Guang; Cheng, Li-Ping; Huang, Qing-Feng; Wu, Jiang; Luo, Xi-Chang; Wang, Zhu-Jun; Zhong, Yan-Yan; Bai, Yan; Wu, Xiao-Yan; Jin, Run-Ming",Curr Med Sci,,217
490175,Evidence of the effectiveness of travel-related measures during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic: a rapid systematic review,2021,"The world is becoming increasingly vulnerable to infectious diseases, creating a global health security issue. Over the last 2 decades, many global and national health crises have emerged such as SARS, H5N1, H1N1, and now COVID-19. The recent COVID-19 pandemic reflects how unexpected events often audit our resilience (Weick and Sutclifffe [10]. The mortality and morbidity statistics associated with COVID-19 has become a key impact metric. At the time of publication, in Canada, upwards of 675,000 cases of COVID 19 have been reported and 17,500 deaths (https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/epidemiological-summary-covid-19-cases.html?stat=num&measure=total&map=pt#a2 ). The pandemic has tested and left wanting the global ability to respond to such a threat. Heyman et al. [3] argue that “the world is ill-prepared” to handle any “sustained and threatening public-health emergency.” Such public health emergencies stemming from infectious disease outbreaks are creating a serious threat to societal well-being and national security. The inherent interconnectivity and interdependency within societal public health systems require analysis that provides a deep understanding regarding the potential impact of COVID-19 on populations in response to intervention strategies. In dynamic systems, the effects of an intervention are only evident after a time delay. Understanding the system and its inherent dynamics is a key requirement for sensemaking and is a game-changer in supporting crisis management of complex issues such as a global pandemic. This chapter examines a case study of early sensemaking about the COVD-19 pandemic in Canada through the application of System Dynamics. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Taylor, I.; Masys, A.

491328,Surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic - Authors' reply,2020,"Genetic variability across the three major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genes (human leukocyte antigen A [HLA-A], -B, and -C genes) may affect susceptibility to and severity of the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We performed a comprehensive in silico analysis of viral peptide-MHC class I binding affinity across 145 HLA-A, -B, and -C genotypes for all SARS-CoV-2 peptides. We further explored the potential for cross-protective immunity conferred by prior exposure to four common human coronaviruses. The SARS-CoV-2 proteome was successfully sampled and was represented by a diversity of HLA alleles. However, we found that HLA-B*46:01 had the fewest predicted binding peptides for SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that individuals with this allele may be particularly vulnerable to COVID-19, as they were previously shown to be for SARS (M. Lin, H.-T. Tseng, J. A. Trejaut, H.-L. Lee, et al., BMC Med Genet 4:9, 2003, https://bmcmedgenet.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2350-4-9). Conversely, we found that HLA-B*15:03 showed the greatest capacity to present highly conserved SARS-CoV-2 peptides that are shared among common human coronaviruses, suggesting that it could enable cross-protective T-cell-based immunity. Finally, we reported global distributions of HLA types with potential epidemiological ramifications in the setting of the current pandemic.IMPORTANCE Individual genetic variation may help to explain different immune responses to a virus across a population. In particular, understanding how variation in HLA may affect the course of COVID-19 could help identify individuals at higher risk from the disease. HLA typing can be fast and inexpensive. Pairing HLA typing with COVID-19 testing where feasible could improve assessment of severity of viral disease in the population. Following the development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, individuals with high-risk HLA types could be prioritized for vaccination.","Nguyen, Austin; David, Julianne K; Maden, Sean K; Wood, Mary A; Weeder, Benjamin R; Nellore, Abhinav; Thompson, Reid F",J. virol,,217

492019,Second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic: D-dimer levels are not so high anymore,2021,"BACKGROUND: The unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic has brought drastic changes to the field of plastic surgery. It is critical for stakeholders in this field to identify the changes in public interest in plastic procedures to be adequately prepared to meet the challenges of the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to examine tweets related to the public interest in plastic procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic and to help stakeholders in the field of plastic surgery adjust their practices and sustain their operations during the current difficult situation of the pandemic. METHODS: Using a web crawler, 73,963 publicly accessible tweets about the most common cosmetic surgical and minimally invasive plastic procedures were collected. The tweets were grouped into three phases, and the tweeting frequencies and Google Trends indices were examined. Tweeting frequency, sentiment, and word frequency analyses were performed with Python modules. RESULTS: Tweeting frequency increased by 24.0% in phase 2 and decreased by 9.1% in phase 3. Tweets about breast augmentation, liposuction, and abdominoplasty (""tummy tuck"") procedures consecutively increased over the three phases of the pandemic. Interest in Botox and chemical peel procedures revived first when the lockdown was lifted. The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a negative impact on public sentiment about plastic procedures. The word frequency pattern significantly changed after phase 1 and then remained relatively stable. CONCLUSIONS: According to Twitter data, the public maintained their interest in plastic procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Stakeholders should consider refocusing on breast augmentation, liposuction, and abdominoplasty procedures during the current phase of the pandemic. In the case of a second wave of COVID-19, stakeholders should prepare for a temporary surge of Botox and chemical peel procedures.","Liu, Wenhui; Wei, Zhiru; Cheng, Xu; Pang, Ran; Zhang, Han; Li, Guangshuai",J Med Internet Res,,217

Analysis of high-dimensional data, however, is vulnerable to the hidden influence of confounding variables, especially as users apply ad hoc filtering operations to visualize only specific subsets of an entire dataset. Thus, visual data-driven analysis can mislead users and encourage mistaken assumptions about causality or the strength of relationships between features. This work introduces a novel visual approach designed to reveal the presence of confounding variables via counterfactual possibilities during visual data analysis. It is implemented in CoFact, an interactive visualization prototype that determines and visualizes \textit{counterfactual subsets} to better support user exploration of feature relationships. Using publicly available datasets, we conducted a controlled user study to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach; the results indicate that users exposed to counterfactual visualizations formed more careful judgments about feature-to-outcome relationships.","Kaul, Smiti; Borland, David; Cao, Nan; Gotz, David",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.10309v1.pdf,217

In spite of this, coping measures differ throughout the national territory, as does the disease's impact on the population. This cross-sectional observational study, with 59 695 cases of COVID-19 registered in the state of Alagoas between March and August 2020, analysed clinical-epidemiological variables, incidence rate, mortality rate, case fatality rate (CFR) and the social indicators municipal human development index (MHDI) and social vulnerability index (SVI). Moran statistics and regression models were applied. Logistic regression analysis was applied to determine the predictors of death. The incidence rate was 1788.7/100 000 inhabitants;mortality rate was 48.0/100 000 and CFR was 2.7%. The highest incidence rates were observed in municipalities with better human development (overall MHDI (I = 0.1668;p = 0.002), education MHDI (I = 0.1649;p = 0.002) and income MHDI (I = 0.1880;p = 0.005)) and higher social vulnerability (overall SVI (I = 0.0599;p = 0.033)). CFR was associated with higher social vulnerability (SVI human capital (I = 0.0858;p = 0.004) and SVI urban infrastructure (I = 0.0985;p = 0.040)). Of the analysed cases, 55.4% were female;2/3 were Black or Brown and the median age was 41 years. Among deaths, most were male (919;57.4%) and elderly (1171;73.1%). The predictors of death were male sex, advanced age and the presence of comorbidities. In Alagoas, Brazil, the disease has undergone a process of interiorisation and caused more deaths in poorer municipalities.

494275,Impact of COVID-19 on Access to Care: A National Patient Survey,2021,"BACKGROUND: Despite widespread use, the accuracy of the diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2 infection is poorly understood. The aim of our work was to better quantify misclassification errors in identification of true cases of COVID-19 and to study the impact of these errors in epidemic curves using publicly available surveillance data from Alberta, Canada and Philadelphia, USA. METHODS: We examined time-series data of laboratory tests for SARS-CoV-2 viral infection, the causal agent for COVID-19, to try to explore, using a Bayesian approach, the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic test. RESULTS: Our analysis revealed that the data were compatible with near-perfect specificity, but it was challenging to gain information about sensitivity. We applied these insights to uncertainty/bias analysis of epidemic curves under the assumptions of both improving and degrading sensitivity. If the sensitivity improved from 60 to 95%, the adjusted epidemic curves likely falls within the 95% confidence intervals of the observed counts. However, bias in the shape and peak of the epidemic curves can be pronounced, if sensitivity either degrades or remains poor in the 60-70% range. In the extreme scenario, hundreds of undiagnosed cases, even among the tested, are possible, potentially leading to further unchecked contagion should these cases not self-isolate. CONCLUSION: The best way to better understand bias in the epidemic curves of COVID-19 due to errors in testing is to empirically evaluate misclassification of diagnosis in clinical settings and apply this knowledge to adjustment of epidemic curves.","Burstyn, Igor; Goldstein, Neal D; Gustafson, Paul",BMC Med Res Methodol,,217

494537,Correction to: Virtual visits for chronic neurologic disorders during COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The emergence and rapid spread of COVID-19 have caused widespread and catastrophic public health and economic impact, requiring governments to restrict societal activity to reduce the spread of the disease. The role of household transmission in the population spread of SARS-CoV-2, and of host immunity in limiting transmission, is poorly understood. This paper describes a protocol for a prospective observational study of a cohort of households in Liverpool City Region, UK, which addresses the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between household members and how immunological response to the infection changes over time. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Households in the Liverpool City Region, in which members have not previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 with a nucleic acid amplification test, are followed up for an initial period of 12 weeks. Participants are asked to provide weekly self-throat and nasal swabs and record their activity and presence of symptoms. Incidence of infection and household secondary attack rates of COVID-19 are measured. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 will be investigated against a range of demographic and behavioural variables. Blood and faecal samples are collected at several time points to evaluate immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and prevalence and risk factors for faecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2, respectively. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has received approval from the National Health Service Research Ethics Committee; REC Reference: 20/HRA/2297, IRAS Number: 283 464. Results will be disseminated through scientific conferences and peer-reviewed open access publications. A report of the findings will also be shared with participants. The study will quantify the scale and determinants of household transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, immunological responses before and during the different stages of infection will be analysed, adding to the understanding of the range of immunological response by infection severity.","Setiabudi, Wega; Hungerford, Daniel; Subramaniam, Krishanthi; Vaselli, Natasha Marcella; Shaw, Victoria E; Wilton, Moon; Vivancos, Roberto; Aston, Stephen; Platt, Gareth; Moitt, Tracy; Jones, Ashley P; Gabbay, Mark; Buchan, Iain; Carrol, Enitan D; Iturriza-Gomara, Miren; Solomon, Tom; Greenhalf, William; Naisbitt, Dean J; Adams, Emily R; Cunliffe, Nigel A; Turtle, Lance; French, Neil",BMJ Open,,217

Despite that, thrombocytopenia in patients with severe COVID-19 infections is surprisingly uncommon. By examining the blood film of 20 ICU patients with COVID-19, we observed the presence of platelet aggregates and macrothrombocytes indicating increased platelet activity. We compared these findings with 20 blood films of non-severe COVID-19 cases where these findings were absent. These morphology features could be consistent with severe COVID-19 infection and is further evidence of the important role that platelets play when COVID-19 manifests with thrombotic complications or respiratory failure.","Rampotas, Alexandros; Pavord, Sue",J. clin. pathol,,217

495726,Delirium triggered by COVID-19 vaccine in an elderly patient,2021,"BACKGROUND: More than 300 million people carry a diagnosis of asthma, with data to suggest that they are at a higher risk for infection or adverse outcomes from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Asthma is remarkably heterogeneous, and it is currently unclear how patient-intrinsic factors may relate to coronavirus disease 2019. OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify and characterize subsets of patients with asthma at increased risk for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. METHODS: Participants from 2 large asthma cohorts were stratified using clinically relevant parameters to identify factors related to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) expression within bronchial epithelium. ACE-2-correlated gene signatures were used to interrogate publicly available databases to identify upstream signaling events and novel therapeutic targets. RESULTS: Stratifying by type 2 inflammatory biomarkers, we identified subjects who demonstrated low peripheral blood eosinophils accompanied by increased expression of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 receptor ACE2 in bronchial epithelium. Genes highly correlated with ACE2 overlapped with type 1 and 2 IFN signatures, normally induced by viral infections. T-cell recruitment and activation within bronchoalveolar lavage cells of ACE2-high subjects was reciprocally increased. These patients demonstrated characteristics corresponding to risk factors for severe coronavirus disease 2019, including male sex, history of hypertension, low peripheral blood, and elevated bronchoalveolar lavage lymphocytes. CONCLUSIONS: ACE2 expression is linked to upregulation of viral response genes in a subset of type 2-low patients with asthma with characteristics resembling known risk factors for severe coronavirus disease 2019. Therapies targeting the IFN family and T-cell-activating factors may therefore be of benefit in a subset of patients.","Camiolo, Matthew; Gauthier, Marc; Kaminski, Naftali; Ray, Anuradha; Wenzel, Sally E",J Allergy Clin Immunol,,217

Otolaryngologists employed by small practices may be particularly vulnerable to the effects of ongoing losses because these organizations often have limited financial reserves. We performed a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of federal direct aid provided to small practices (defined as &#8804;15 clinicians) employing otolaryngologists, using the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Physician Compare National Downloadable File and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Provider Relief Fund database. As of June 18, 2020, the HHS had allocated nearly $80 million to 966 (88.9%) of 1087 small practices employing 2455 otolaryngologists. The median amount of aid per clinician was $7909 (interquartile range, $4409-$12,710). These findings suggest that the majority of small practices have received direct aid through the HHS Provider Relief Fund, but aid amounts have thus far been modest relative to the fixed costs of practice.","Xiao, Roy; Rathi, Vinay K",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,,217

The article is structured in 2 parts: The first discusses the problem of agrifood systems in the context of capitalism in crisis and its effects on the spread of diseases such as the coronavirus, and the second discusses the neglect of the Bolsonaro government in facing the COVID-19 pandemic and the Brazilian universal health system. Evidence shows that the Bolsonaro government has led to more deaths and more of the barbarism of capitalism.

METHODS: With the health crisis, new missions have been entrusted during hospital internships, whereas certain internship sites were removed in hospitals and as part of the health service organization. In addition, some students who were no longer in internship returned to the hospital setting for helping in critical activities. Student engagement was studied with a questionnaire and focus groups including six or seven students in each group. RESULTS: Forty-three students participated to the study. The answers to the questionnaire highlighted that they were engaged, that they usually did not wait for compensation, and that most of them were satisfied by their activity during the crisis. The thematic analysis demonstrated that despite a feeling of frustration, which was often associated with the interruption of rewarded activities, and despite a stress due to the particular context, student engagement was supported by a better consideration of the pharmacist's role as a professional in public health and by a better acknowledgement of this role by other health professionals. CONCLUSION: This level of engagement is particularly encouraging because it is the witness of the ability of pharmacists to mobilize for general interest, even in adverse context.","Spiesser-Robelet, L; Baglin, I; Moal, F; Lagarce, F; Eveillard, M",Ann. pharm. fr,,217

This character makes it adjacently coincide with oxygen atom when it is in the gaseous state. A field variation develops for the day and night. On having the suitable interaction of photons with leaves in daytime, pieces of arc-shaped energy are made. To get the ground surface, the pieces of arc-shaped energy become empty due to the highest value of gravity at ground level. On sunset, empty pieces of arc-shaped energy fill with the force having the levitating nature, so they start flying to gather under the tree roof. Such filled force pieces develop the affinity in adjacently coinciding atoms of gaseous carbon and oxygen. At certain behavior of force, the downward ends of filled force pieces enter into the suitable unfilled states of gaseous atoms adhering the binding of C - O or O - C - O. So, a large number of CO and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules develops under the tree roof, which is not good for breathing during the night. In the morning, an arc-shaped energy breaks the affinity in CO and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules by giving back the filled force. As a result, the molecules dissociate into the atoms. To get the ground surface, the dissociated gaseous carbon atoms converted into graphitic carbon before noon. So, the oxygen concentration during sunshine increases under the tree roof thereby improving the breathing level of the one resting in the shadow. So, COVID-19 patients can take advantage of the raised level of oxygen. But, it is not useful to rest under the tree roofs at night. How the plantation of trees can be essential for a sustainable environment helps build remarkable procedures and is being discussed here.","Mubarak, Ali",,,217

A counterview,2020,"BACKGROUND: During 2009-2010, pandemic influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 virus (pH1N1) infections in England occurred in two epidemic waves. Reasons for a reported increase in case-severity during the second wave are unclear. METHODS: We analysed hospital-based surveillance for patients with pH1N1 infections in England during 2009-2010 and linked national data sets to estimate ethnicity, socio-economic status and death within 28 days of admission. We used multivariable logistic regression to assess whether changes in demographic, clinical and management characteristics of patients could explain an increase in ICU admission or death, and accounted for missing values using multiple imputation. RESULTS: During the first wave, 54/960 (6%) hospitalised patients required intensive care and 21/960 (2%) died; during the second wave 143/1420 (10%) required intensive care and 55/1420 (4%) died. In a multivariable model, during the second wave patients were less likely to be from an ethnic minority (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.26-0.42), have an elevated deprivation score (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.68-0.83), have known comorbidity (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.63-0.97) or receive antiviral therapy &#8804;2 days before onset (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.56-0.92). Increased case-severity during the second wave was not explained by changes in demographic, clinical or management characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Monitoring changes in patient characteristics could help target interventions during multiple waves of COVID-19 or a future influenza pandemic. To understand and respond to changes in case-severity, surveillance is needed that includes additional factors such as admission thresholds and seasonal coinfections.","Plumb, Ian D; Harris, Ross; Green, Helen K; Ellis, Joanna; Baisley, Kathy; Pebody, Richard G",Influenza other respir. viruses,,217

Initially, there were many uncertainties and did not exist formal recommendations. Before official statements were available, we performed an allogeneic HCT in a 57-year-old male from a related matched donor in the incubation period of COVID-19 where the patient did not develop the disease. Actual epidemiology data suggest that transmission may occur early in the course of infection, even from asymptomatic patients in the incubation period. In our knowledge this is the first case report of an adult hematopoietic cell donor with COVID-19 in the incubation period where the transplant is successfully completed with no transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

Within cells, biliverdin is generated from free heme and it is subsequently reduced to bilirubin. Although bilirubin can function as an oxidant scavenger, its potent antioxidant activity reflects its ability to inactivate some isoforms of NADPH oxidase. Free bilirubin can also function as an agonist for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR); this may explain its ability to promote protective Treg activity in cellular and rodent models of inflammatory disease. AhR agonists also promote transcription of the gene coding for Nrf-2, and hence can up-regulate phase 2 induction of antioxidant enzymes such as HO-1. Hence, it is proposed that C-Phycocyanin/PCB chiefly exert their protective effects via inhibition of NADPH oxidase activity, as well as by AhR agonism that both induces Treg activity and up-regulates phase 2 induction. This simple model may explain their potent antioxidant/anti-inflammatory effects. Additionally, PCB might mimic biliverdin in activating anti-inflammatory signaling mediated by biliverdin reductase. This essay reviews recent research in which C-Phycocyanin and/or PCB, administered orally, parenterally, or intranasally, have achieved marked protective effects in rodent and cell culture models of Ischemic Stroke and Multiple Sclerosis, and suggests that these agents may likewise be protective for Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and in COVID-19 and its neurological complications.","Pentón-Rol, Giselle; Marín-Prida, Javier; McCarty, Mark F",Curr. neuropharmacol,,217

Due to fast increased number of the positive patients with COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 is considered highly pathogenic virus with various clinical presentations. Apart from the typical respiratory symptoms, neurological complains in COVID-19 involving central and peripheral nervous systems have been reported. This paper aimed to review the neurological findings reported in patients with COVID-19. We qualitatively reviewed studies reporting COVID-19 patient(s) with neurological manifestations according to the recommendations of PRISMA statement.There were twelve studies included in this brief review. We found that patients with neurological findings were reported ranging from symptomatic complain of headache and dizziness to specific neurological diseases/syndromes, such as meningitis/encephalitis, acute cerebrovascular diseases, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and Miller Fisher syndrome. This review suggests the possible neurological involvement in COVID-19.

508653,Promoting attachment between parents and neonates despite the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Background : COVID-19, a disease caused by a novel coronavirus, is a major global human threat that has turned into a pandemic. Identification and development of drugs/vaccines is urgently needed for prevention and therapy of the COVID-19 virus (SARS-CoV-2) infection. SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro,) plays a key role in viral protein processing for its replication and inhibition of Mpro leads to prevention of viral replication. The SARS-CoV-2 Mpro is considered a promising drug target, as it is dissimilar to human proteases. Several peptidic protease inhibitors have been developed as SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors for COVID-19 treatment. In this study, we screened naturally occurring peptidic α-hydroxy amides (PHAs) (phebestin, probestin, bestatin) for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibition. Materials and methods : In vitro COVID-19 Mpro fluorometric assay was performed to evaluate its inhibitory efficacy by PHAs. Isothermal titration calorimetry technique was used to demonstrate the binding affinity between COVID-19 Mpro and PHAs. Circular dichroism technique was used to determine the structural changes in secondary structure of COVID-19 Mpro induced by PHAs. Molecular docking studies were performed to demonstrate the molecular level mechanism behind COVID-19 Mpro inhibitory efficacy of PHAs. In addition, cytotoxic effects of PHAs were evaluated on lung epithelial cells of mice for its therapeutic applications for COVID-19 through nasal delivery. Results and discussion : Phebestin (IC50 = 17.98 µM) Probestin (IC50 = 48.31 µM) and Bestatin (IC50 &gt; 100 µM) significantly inhibited the COVID-19 Mpro activity. The KD (dissociation constant) values of phebestin and probestin for COVID-19 Mpro were 31.23 and 43.51 µM, respectively. CD spectrum analysis demonstrated that phebestin and probestin (10 µM) induced changes in the secondary structure of COVID-19 Mpro. Molecular docking studies demonstrated that Interactions of phebestin and probestin with active site amino acids. Phebestin and probestin did not show any cytotoxicity on normal mouse lung epithelial cells up to 100 µM. Conclusion : Preliminary in vitro studies demonstrated that naturally occurring PHAs derivatives phebestin and probestin are SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors and warranted further studies to develop as drugs for COVID-19.","Yarla, Nagendra Pathuri Gopal Gali Hariprasad Terzyan Simon Singh Anil Scotti Marcus Madka Venkateshwar Rao Chinthalapally",The FASEB Journal,,217
509553,Cardiopulmonary resuscitation during the COVID-19 pandemic: Maintaining provider and patient safety,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has the potential to significantly impact burns patients both directly through infective complications of an immunocompromised cohort, and indirectly through disruption of care pathways and resource limitations. The pandemic presents new challenges that must be overcome to maintain patient safety; in particular, the potential increased risks of surgical intervention, anaesthesia and ventilation. This study comprehensively reviews the measures implemented to adapt referral pathways and mitigate the risk posed by COVID-19 during the height of the pandemic, within a large Burns Centre. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was designed to assess patients treated at the Burns Centre during the UK COVID-19 pandemic peak (April-May 2020), following implementation of new safety measures. All patients were analysed for 30-day mortality. In addition, a prospective controlled cohort study was undertaken on all inpatients and a random sample of outpatients with telephone follow-up at 30 days. These patients were divided into three groups (operative inpatients, non-operative inpatients, outpatients). COVID-19 related data collected included test results, contact with proven cases, isolation status and symptoms. The implemented departmental service COVID-19 safety adaptations are described. RESULTS: Of 323 patients treated at the Burns Centre during the study period, no 30-day COVID-19 related deaths occurred (0/323). Of the 80 patients analysed in the prospective controlled cohort section of the study, 51 underwent COVID-19 testing, 3.9% (2/51) were positive. Both cases were in the operative group, however in comparison to the non-operative and outpatient groups, there was no significant increase in COVID-19 incidence in operative patients. CONCLUSIONS: We found no COVID-19 related mortality during the study period. With appropriate precautions, burns patients were not exposed to an increased COVID-19 risk. Similarly, burns patients undergoing operative management were not at a significantly increased risk of contracting COVID-19 in comparison to non-operative groups.","Smith, A C D; Miranda, B H; Strong, B; Jica, R C I; Pinto-Lopes, R; Khan, W; Martin, N A; El-Muttardi, N; Barnes, D; Shelley, O P",Burns,,217

In the present study, we conducted a literature review about the potential infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in different biological tissues and the influence of various tissue processing and sterilization procedures on viral inactivation. The search revealed that SARS-CoV-2 binds to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor to penetrate human cells. These receptors are present in skin cells, musculoskeletal tissue, amniotic membranes, cardiovascular tissue and ocular tissues, including the cornea. In general, we found that coronaviruses are stable at low temperatures, and inactivated upon exposure to extreme heat and pH. Notably, gamma irradiation, which has already been employed to inactivate SARS and MERS, could be useful for sterilizing skin, amnion and musculoskeletal tissues against SARS-CoV-2. We conclude that due to the limited information about the effects of physical and chemical tissue processing methods on viral neutralization, rigorous donor screening is still essential for tissue transplant recipient safety.","Paggiaro, André Oliveira; Carvalho, Viviane Fernandes; Gemperli, Rolf",Cell tissue bank,,217

METHODS: A customized 19-item survey and the perceived stress scale (PSS) were applied to undergraduate dental students from the US, Spain, Ireland, Chile, India, and Brazil between April 10 and July 5, 2020. Linear modeling and mediation analysis were used to explore the relationships among demographics, stressors, coping mechanisms, social support, and stress RESULTS: A total of 4475 students responded to the survey. The majority (72.4%) were women, and 52.3% had no COVID-19 training at the time of the survey. The students reported that they had to accommodate to changes in patient care (96.6%) and didactic learning (95.2%) activities, while 88.5% of the respondents indicated at least one of their courses moved online. Transition to online courses went ""smoothly with some troubles"" for 51.8% of the respondents, and 48.3% perceived the faculty as prepared for the online transition; however, 45.9% reported feeling extremely concerned about the impact of COVID-19 on their education. The average PSS score was 21.9 of 40 (moderate stress). Multivariate models were built for participants with full data (n = 3899). Being male, having completed more dental coursework, and perceiving a smoother transition were associated with lower PSS scores; more concern about academic progress was associated with higher PSS. Faculty support mediated the relationship between a smoothness of transition and concern about academic progress and PSS scores CONCLUSION: Stress caused by the pandemic may be alleviated by smoother transition and good faculty support.","Klaassen, Hannah; Ashida, Sato; Comnick, Carissa L; Xie, Xian Jin; Smith, Becky M; Tabrizi, Maryam; Arsenault, Karin; Capin, Oriana R; Scully, Allison C; da Mata, Cristiane; Soto, Annetty P; Dias Ribeiro, Ana Paula; Prince, David; Christensen, Angela; Giner-Tarrida, Lluís; Satorres Nieto, Marta; León, Soraya; Gambetta-Tessini, Karla; Santos, Mateus B F; Dias da Silva, Marco Antonio; Pereira, Andresa C; Dias do Carmo, Elaine; Aurora Stabile Gonnelli, Fernanda; Carvalho, Fabíola G; Collares, Kaue; Bervian, Juliane; Sarkis-Onofre, Rafael; Jerfeson Dos Santos Gonçalves, Francisco; Bueno-Silva, Bruno; Estela Haddad, Ana; Gurgel, Bruno César de Vasconcelos; Alves, Polliana M; Shigli, Kamal; Nayak, Sushma S; Nayak, Prajna P; Murugaboopathy, Vikneshan; Savitha, P N; Murthy, Varsha; Deshpande, Saee; Marchini, Leonardo",J. dent. educ,,217

However, the definition and timing of liver injury is different among the published articles. The aim of the present study is to evaluate whether COVID-19 related liver injury at the time of first presentation is associated with the course of the disease. METHODS: We conducted a single center retrospective study at Amphia Hospital in Breda, The Netherlands, from February 1 through April 30, 2020. Patients with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction confirmed COVID-19 were included. We excluded patients with known chronic liver disease, harmful alcohol consumption or patients on certain antibiotics prior to admission. The clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with and without COVID-19 related liver injury were compared. Liver injury was defined as elevated alanine aminotransferase and/or alkaline phosphatase at the time when the first positive COVID-19 sample was obtained. RESULTS: We included 382 patients with COVID-19 infection. The incidence of liver injury was 41.6% (n = 159). Being female was associated with liver injury (p < .05). Liver injury was not associated with a more severe course of the disease in terms of hospitalization, length of hospital stay, intensive care unit admission and mortality. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 related liver injury at the time of diagnosis of COVID-19 does not seem to be associated with a more severe course of the disease in our hospital.","Sikkema, B J Barend; Sint Nicolaas, J Jerome; van Wijngaarden, P Peter",Scand J Gastroenterol,,217

In particular, SARS-CoV-2 is currently a major threat to public health worldwide. The spike (S) homotrimers bind to their receptors via the receptor-binding domain (RBD), which is a major target to block viral entry. In this study, we selected Alpha-coronavirus (HCoV-229E) and Beta-coronavirus (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) as models. Their RBDs exist two different conformational states (lying or standing) in the prefusion S-trimer structure. Then, the differences in the immune responses to RBDs from these coronaviruses were analyzed structurally and immunologically. Our results showed that more RBD-specific antibodies (antibody titers: 1.28×105; 2.75×105) were induced by the S-trimer with the RBD in the ""standing"" state (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) than the S-trimer with the RBD in the ""lying"" state (HCoV-229E, antibody titers: <500), and more S-trimer-specific antibodies were induced by the RBD in the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (antibody titers: 6.72×105; 5×105) than HCoV-229E (antibody titers:1.125×103). Besides, we found that the ability of the HCoV-229E RBD to induce neutralizing antibodies was lower than S-trimer, and the intact and stable S1 subunit was essential for producing efficient neutralizing antibodies against HCoV-229E. Importantly, our results reveal different vaccine strategies for coronaviruses, and S-trimer is better than RBD as a target for vaccine development in Alpha-coronavirus Our findings will provide important implications for future development of coronavirus vaccines.Importance Outbreak of coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV-2, poses a serious threat to global public health. Development of vaccines to prevent the coronaviruses that can infect humans has always been a top priority. Coronavirus spike (S) protein is considered as a major target for vaccine development. Currently, structural studies have shown that Alpha-coronavirus (HCoV-229E) and Beta-coronavirus (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) RBDs are in ""lying"" and ""standing"" states in the prefusion S-trimer structure. Here, we evaluated the ability of S-trimer and RBD to induce neutralizing antibodies among these coronaviruses. Our results showed that the S-trimer and RBD are both candidates for subunit vaccines in Beta-coronavirus (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) with a RBD ""standing"" state. However, for Alpha-coronavirus (HCoV-229E) with a RBD ""lying"" state, the S-trimer may be more suitable for subunit vaccines than the RBD. Our results will provide novel ideas for the development of vaccines targeting S protein in the future.","Shi, Yuejun; Shi, Jiale; Sun, Limeng; Tan, Yubei; Wang, Gang; Guo, Fenglin; Hu, Guangli; Fu, Yanan; Fu, Zhen F; Xiao, Shaobo; Peng, Guiqing",J. virol,,217

Given this increased visibility, in-depth analysis of COVID-19 misinformation spread is critical to understanding the evolution of ideas with potential negative public health impact. Methods: Using a curated data set of COVID-19 tweets (N ~120 million tweets) spanning late January to early May 2020, we applied methods including regular expression filtering, supervised machine learning, sentiment analysis, geospatial analysis, and dynamic topic modeling to trace the spread of misinformation and to characterize novel features of COVID-19 conspiracy theories. Results: Random forest models for four major misinformation topics provided mixed results, with narrowly-defined conspiracy theories achieving F1 scores of 0.804 and 0.857, while more broad theories performed measurably worse, with scores of 0.654 and 0.347. Despite this, analysis using model-labeled data was beneficial for increasing the proportion of data matching misinformation indicators. We were able to identify distinct increases in negative sentiment, theory-specific trends in geospatial spread, and the evolution of conspiracy theory topics and subtopics over time. Conclusions: COVID-19 related conspiracy theories show that history frequently repeats itself, with the same conspiracy theories being recycled for new situations. We use a combination of supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and natural language processing techniques to look at the evolution of theories over the first four months of the COVID-19 outbreak, how these theories intertwine, and to hypothesize on more effective public health messaging to combat misinformation in online spaces.","Gerts, Dax; Shelley, Courtney D.; Parikh, Nidhi; Pitts, Travis; Ross, Chrysm Watson; Fairchild, Geoffrey; Chavez, Nidia Yadria Vaquera; Daughton, Ashlynn R.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.07729v1.pdf,217

We retrospectively analyzed 147 consecutive patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to three ICUs in Wuhan from February 9th, 2020 to March 20th, 2020. The baseline coagulation and other characteristics were studied. Our results showed that the prolonged PT, FDP, DD were positively correlated with the levels of neutrophils, ferritin, LDH, total bilirubin, multi-inflammation cytokines, and negatively correlated with the lymphocytes level (p < 0.01). The level of ATIII was significantly negatively correlated with the levels of neutrophils, ferritin, LDH, total bilirubin, IL2R, IL6 and IL8 (p < 0.05). The patients in the ARDS group had a more prominent abnormality in PT, FDP, DD and ATIII, while the patients in the AKI group had more prolonged PT, more severe FDP and DD level, more inferior ATIII and Fib level than those in the non-AKI group (p < 0.01). The value of PT, DD and FDP were positively correlated with the classical APACHE II, SOFA and qSOFA scores, while the ATIII was negatively correlated with them (p < 0.001). The high levels of PT, FDP and DD were correlated with in-hospital mortality (p < 0.001). In conclusion, blood coagulation disorder was prominent in ICU patients with COVID-19 and was correlated with multi-inflammation factors. The abnormality of blood coagulation parameters could be an adverse prognostic indicator for ICU patients with COVID-19.","Liu, Yang; Gao, Weibo; Guo, Wei; Guo, Yang; Shi, Maojing; Dong, Guiying; Ge, Qinggang; Zhu, Jihong; Lu, Jin",J Thromb Thrombolysis,,217
517489,Healthcare for non-Covid-19 liver disease patients during the Covid-19 pandemic in Bangladesh: Current trend and future implications,2020,"BACKGROUND: After the first COVID-19 case detected on 8 December 2019 in Wuhan, the Provincial Capital of Hubei, the epidemic quickly spread throughout the whole country of China. Low developmental levels are often associated with infectious disease epidemic, this study attempted to test this notion with COVID-19 data. METHODS: Data by province from 8 December 2019 to 16 February 2020 were analysed using regression method. Outcomes were days from the first COVID-19 case in the origin of Hubei Province to the date when case was first detected in a destination province, and cumulative number of confirmed cases. Provincial gross domestic products (GDPs) were used to predict the outcomes while considering spatial distance and population density. RESULTS: Of the total 70 548 COVID-19 cases in all 31 provinces, 58 182 (82.5%) were detected in Hubei and 12 366 (17.5%) in other destination provinces. Regression analysis of data from the 30 provinces indicated that GDP was negatively associated with days of virus spreading (ß=-0.2950, p<0.10) and positively associated with cumulative cases (ß=97.8709, p<0.01) after controlling for spatial distance. The relationships were reversed with ß=0.1287 (p<0.01) for days and ß=-54.3756 (p<0.01) for cumulative cases after weighing in population density and controlling for spatial distance. CONCLUSION: Higher levels of developmental is a risk factor for cross-province spread of COVID-19. This study adds new data to literature regarding the role of economic growth in facilitating spatial spreading of infectious diseases, and provides timely data informing antiepidemic strategies and developmental plan to balance economic growth and people's health.","Mo, Qiqing; Chen, Xinguang; Yu, Bin; Ma, Zhenyu",J. epidemiol. community health (1979),,217
518522,Probable anxiety and components of psychological resilience amid COVID-19: A population-based study,2021,"We investigate how the economic consequences of the pandemic and the government-mandated measures to contain its spread affect the self-employed - particularly women - in Germany. For our analysis, we use representative, real-time survey data in which respondents were asked about their situation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings indicate that among the self-employed, who generally face a higher likelihood of income losses due to COVID-19 than employees, women are about one-third more likely to experience income losses than their male counterparts. We do not find a comparable gender gap among employees. Our results further suggest that the gender gap among the self-employed is largely explained by the fact that women disproportionately work in industries that are more severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our analysis of potential mechanisms reveals that women are significantly more likely to be impacted by government-imposed restrictions, e.g., the regulation of opening hours. We conclude that future policy measures intending to mitigate the consequences of such shocks should account for this considerable variation in economic hardship.","Graeber, Daniel; Kritikos, Alexander S; Seebauer, Johannes",J Popul Econ,,217

Herein, we report a technique for extubating a patient with COVID-19 while minimizing aerosol dispersion. CASE REPORT: We retrospectively identified a total of 79 patients admitted to our hospital from February 2020 to January 2021. Six of these patients were intubated for mechanical ventilation, 2 of whom had to be extubated. We prepared a clear vinyl sheet in the shape of a tent to place over the patient, and 2 staff members, both well experienced in airway management, stood outside the tent on either side of the patient. Before extubation, we confirmed that the patient's consciousness level was good and the patient had no distress by adjusting the dose of sedative drugs. After extubation, a surgical mask was placed on the patient's face. CONCLUSION: Our experience indicates that this method of extubation in a patient with COVID-19 could be safely implemented to protect healthcare workers.","Akatsuka, Masayuki; Yoshinaka, Asami; Hagiwara, Hiroya; Yamamoto, Shuji",J Prim Care Community Health,,217

Recently, a new type of viral infection emerged in Wuhan City, China, and initial genomic sequencing data of this virus do not match with previously sequenced CoVs, suggesting a novel CoV strain (2019-nCoV), which has now been termed severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is suspected to originate from an animal host (zoonotic origin) followed by human-to-human transmission, the possibility of other routes should not be ruled out. Compared to diseases caused by previously known human CoVs, COVID-19 shows less severe pathogenesis but higher transmission competence, as is evident from the continuously increasing number of confirmed cases globally. Compared to other emerging viruses, such as Ebola virus, avian H7N9, SARS-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2 has shown relatively low pathogenicity and moderate transmissibility. Codon usage studies suggest that this novel virus has been transferred from an animal source, such as bats. Early diagnosis by real-time PCR and next-generation sequencing has facilitated the identification of the pathogen at an early stage. Since no antiviral drug or vaccine exists to treat or prevent SARS-CoV-2, potential therapeutic strategies that are currently being evaluated predominantly stem from previous experience with treating SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other emerging viral diseases. In this review, we address epidemiological, diagnostic, clinical, and therapeutic aspects, including perspectives of vaccines and preventive measures that have already been globally recommended to counter this pandemic virus.","Dhama, Kuldeep; Khan, Sharun; Tiwari, Ruchi; Sircar, Shubhankar; Bhat, Sudipta; Malik, Yashpal Singh; Singh, Karam Pal; Chaicumpa, Wanpen; Bonilla-Aldana, D Katterine; Rodriguez-Morales, Alfonso J",Clin. microbiol. rev,,217

590050,Decrease in operative volume in general surgery residents in Chile: effects of the COVID-19 pandemic,2021-03-24,"There is growing concern in Sub-Saharan Africa about the spread of the Ebola virus disease (EVD), formerly known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever, and the public health burden that it ensues. Since 1976, there have been 885,343 suspected and laboratory confirmed cases of EVD and the disease has claimed 2,512 cases and 932 fatality in West Africa. There are certain requirements that must be met when responding to EVD outbreaks and this process could incur certain challenges. For the purposes of this paper, five have been identified: (i) the deficiency in the development and implementation of surveillance response systems against Ebola and others infectious disease outbreaks in Africa; (ii) the lack of education and knowledge resulting in an EVD outbreak triggering panic, anxiety, psychosocial trauma, isolation and dignity impounding, stigmatisation, community ostracism and resistance to associated socio-ecological and public health consequences; (iii) limited financial resources, human technical capacity and weak community and national health system operational plans for prevention and control responses, practices and management; (iv) inadequate leadership and coordination; and (v) the lack of development of new strategies, tools and approaches, such as improved diagnostics and novel therapies including vaccines which can assist in preventing, controlling and containing Ebola outbreaks as well as the spread of the disease. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop and implement an active early warning alert and surveillance response system for outbreak response and control of emerging infectious diseases. Understanding the unending risks of transmission dynamics and resurgence is essential in implementing rapid effective response interventions tailored to specific local settings and contexts. Therefore, the following actions are recommended: (i) national and regional inter-sectorial and trans-disciplinary surveillance response systems that include early warnings, as well as critical human resources development, must be quickly adopted by allied ministries and organisations in African countries in epidemic and pandemic responses; (ii) harnessing all stakeholders commitment and advocacy in sustained funding, collaboration, communication and networking including community participation to enhance a coordinated responses, as well as tracking and prompt case management to combat challenges; (iii) more research and development in new drug discovery and vaccines; and (iv) understanding the involvement of global health to promote the establishment of public health surveillance response systems with functions of early warning, as well as monitoring and evaluation in upholding research-action programmes and innovative interventions.","Tambo, Ernest; Ugwu, Emmanuel Chidiebere; Ngogang, Jeane Yonkeu",Infect Dis Poverty,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25120913/; https://doi.org/10.1186/2049-9957-3-29,217

SUMMARY: In a health system based in Illinois and Wisconsin, pharmacy services are provided by a single, integrated department responsible for all aspects of pharmaceutical care within the organization. Hospital, retail, ambulatory care, and population health services are all managed under one leadership team. All pertinent ancillary services are also managed within the department, including informatics, supply chain, and drug policy. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the pharmacy services leadership has successfully managed volume and capacity challenges by redirecting resources to where they are needed. A disaster response framework based on Federal Emergency Management Agency guidance was put in place, and change management principles were used to rapidly operationalize change. Components of the nimble response have included quickly increasing capacity, thoughtful and timely communication to all team members, strategic decision making with available data, creating an agile pool of labor, and maintaining an efficient system supply chain. Well-being and resilience are emphasized alongside reflection on lessons learned. Some changes made in the urgent response to the pandemic are being considered for long-term implementation. CONCLUSION: Organizations have the potential to respond to almost any situation if they are integrated and teams work together to build flexibility. The keys to success are thoughtful maximization of existing resources and strong communication.","Hannan, Ryan J; Lundholm, Margaret K; Brierton, Dennis; Chapman, Noelle R M",Am J Health Syst Pharm,https://doi.org/10.1093/ajhp/zxaa358; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33119088/,217

Sequences of these intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and IDP regions (IDPRs) are characterized by a number of specific features, such as low overall hydrophobicity and high net charge which makes these proteins predictable. IDPs/IDPRs possess large hydrodynamic volumes, low contents of ordered secondary structure, and are characterized by high structural heterogeneity. They are very flexible, but some may undergo disorder to order transitions in the presence of natural ligands. The degree of these structural rearrangements varies over a very wide range. IDPs/IDPRs are tightly controlled under the normal conditions and have numerous specific functions that complement functions of ordered proteins and domains. When lacking proper control, they have multiple roles in pathogenesis of various human diseases. Gaining structural and functional information about these proteins is a challenge, since they do not typically “freeze” while their “pictures are taken.” However, despite or perhaps because of the experimental challenges, these fuzzy objects with fuzzy structures and fuzzy functions are among the most interesting targets for modern protein research. This review briefly summarizes some of the recent advances in this exciting field and considers some of the basic lessons learned from the analysis of physics, chemistry, and biology of IDPs.","Uversky, Vladimir N",Protein Science,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3690711?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1002/pro.2261; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23553817/,217

The review discusses several questions. What is viral temperature sensitivity? At what range of temperatures are common respiratory viruses sensitive? What is the mechanism for their temperature sensitivity? What is the range of temperature along the human airway? What is it that makes respiratory viruses such successful parasites of the human airway? What is the role of temperature sensitivity in respiratory zoonoses? A definition of temperature sensitivity is proposed, as “the property of a virus to replicate poorly or not at all, at the normal body temperature of the host (restrictive temperature), but to replicate well at the lower temperatures found in the upper airway of the host (permissive temperature).” Temperature sensitivity may influence the success of a respiratory virus in several ways. Firstly; by restricting the infection to the upper airways and reducing the chance of systemic infection that may reduce host mobility and increase mortality, and thus limit the spread of the virus. Secondly; by causing a mild upper airway illness with a limited immune response compared to systemic infection, which means that persistent herd immunity does not develop to the same extent as with systemic infections, and re‐infection may occur later. Thirdly; infection of the upper airway triggers local reflex rhinorrhea, coughing and sneezing which aid the exit of the virus from the host and the spread of infection in the community.","Eccles, Ronald",Rev Med Virol,https://doi.org/10.1002/rmv.2153; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32776651/,217

Two newborn babies had fever, 1 had shortness of breath, 1 had cough and 1 had no syndromes. Supportive treatment was provided for all 4 newborn babies. None required intensive unit care or mechanical ventilation. None had any severe complications. Three newborn babies recovered by the end of this study and had been discharged with 16, 23, and 30 days of hospital stay.

Three newborn babies were separated from mothers right after being born and were not breastfed. In summary, newborn babies are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The symptoms in newborn babies were milder and outcomes were less severe as compared to adults.

Maternal anxiety during pregnancy is a common environmental challenge for the fetus, causing changes in DNA methylation. Here, we determined the mediating role of DNA methylation and the moderating role of offspring sex on the association between maternal anxiety and children’s behavioral measures. In 83 mother–child dyads, maternal anxiety was assessed in each trimester of pregnancy when the child was four years of age. Children’s behavioral measures and children’s buccal DNA methylation levels (NR3C1, IGF2/H19 ICR, and LINE1) were examined. Higher maternal anxiety during the third trimester was associated with more methylation levels of the NR3C1. Moderating effects of sex on the association between maternal anxiety and methylation were found for IGF2/H19 and LINE1 CpGs. Mediation analysis showed that methylation of NR3C1 could buffer the effects of maternal anxiety on children’s behavioral measures, but this effect did not remain significant after controlling for covariates. In conclusion, our data support an association between maternal anxiety during pregnancy and DNA methylation. The results also underscore the importance of sex differences and timing effects. However, DNA methylation as underlying mechanism of the effect of maternal anxiety during pregnancy on offspring’s behavioral measures was not supported.","Cao-Lei, Lei; van den Heuvel, Marion I.; Huse, Klaus; Platzer, Matthias; Elgbeili, Guillaume; Braeken, Marijke A.

This modern-day pandemic fight draws parallels to a war. Because of these similarities, it would make sense that the experiences frontline providers have when transitioning to a normal healthcare routine would emulate experiences service members voice when reintegrating home from a battlefield. These common experiences include a unified mission, an exhausting, adrenaline-packed responsibility, and a celebrity-like status to the public. The pandemic response consumed healthcare with one united mission, but as we reemerge from the pandemic and restore other aspects of our healthcare system, multiple missions develop and compete. Returning to a common routine and regular status can manifest feelings of disappointment in healthcare workers’ everyday lives and career choices and lead to a reexamination of priorities and professions. As an organization with a focus on high reliability, mitigating the harm to staff and delivery system may be our new priority. The risk of not facing this situation head on is a potential exodus of seasoned professionals contemplating their future and selecting other career paths, thus draining the current institutional knowledge and potentially deterring future generations from healthcare. Leaders in the healthcare industry need to take a proactive stance in addressing this reemergence. Integrated, proactive programming is needed utilizing evidence-based resiliency training from professional organizations such as the National Alliance on Mental Illness, the Department of Health and Human Services’ Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, as well as the existing Department of Defense programs. The Veterans Affairs has the backbone to develop and offer these programs and make a positive difference with Employee Whole Health efforts.

Purinergic signaling is involved in the pathophysiology of several viral infections which makes the purinergic system a potential target of investigation in COVID-19. During viral infections, the ATP release initiates a cascade that activates purinergic receptors. This receptor activation enhances the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and performs the chemotaxis of macrophages and neutrophils, generating an association between the immune and the purinergic systems. This review was designed to cover the possible functions of purinergic signaling in COVID-19, focusing on the possible role of purinergic receptors such as P2X7 which contributes to cytokine storm and inflammasome NLRP3 activation and P2Y1 that activates the blood coagulation pathway. The possible role of ectonucleotidases, such as CD39 and CD73, which have the function of dephosphorylating ATP in an immunosuppressive component, adenosine, are also covered in detail. Moreover, therapeutic combination or association possibilities targeting purinergic system components are also suggested as a possible useful tool to be tested in future researches, aiming to unveil a novel option to treat COVID-19 patients.","Franciosi, Maria Luiza Mukai; Lima, Millena Daher Medeiros; Schetinger, Maria Rosa Chitolina; Cardoso, Andréia Machado",Mol Cell Biochem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33740184/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11010-021-04130-4,217

This survey was carried out to assess private facility readiness in providing screening services in Edo State. METHODS: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study carried out among private facilities in Edo state. Facilities were selected using stratified sampling technique. Data was collected using adapted questionnaires and an observational checklist. Facility readiness was assessed using the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control recommendations for screening. Parameters were scored and overall scores were converted to proportions. Facilities that scored 70% and above were adjudged to be ready while facilities that scored 69% and below were adjudged to be not ready. RESULTS: A total of 252 health facilities were assessed, comprising 149 (59.1%) hospitals/clinics, 62 (24.6%) pharmacies and 41 (16.3%) laboratories. One hundred and forty-two (95.3%), 60 (96.8%) and 41 (100.0%) hospitals/clinics, pharmacies and laboratories, respectively had hand hygiene facilities. However, overall facility readiness assessment scores for screening services were low with only 51 (34.2%) hospitals/clinics, 2 (3.2%) pharmacies and 2 (4.9%) laboratories achieving high enough scores to be adjudged ready for screening services. CONCLUSION: Overall facility readiness of the private health sector to provide screening services in Edo State was assessed to be low. The government and facility owners will need to ensure that screening services are improved in all facilities to help mitigate community spread of COVID-19.","Obaseki, Darlington Ewaen; Akoria, Obehi; Ogboghodo, Esohe Olivia; Obarisiagbon, Otaniyenuwa Eloghosa; Mokogwu, Ndubuisi; Omo-Ikirodah, Orezimena Temitope; Adio, Funmilola; Oko-oboh, Gregrey Agbonvihele; Okogbenin, Sylvanus; Tobin, Ekaete; Okundia, Patrick; Irowa, Osamwonyi; Okonmah, Uzor",Pan Afr Med J,https://doi.org/10.11604/pamj.supp.2020.35.2.24468; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33623617/,217

Multiple causes no doubt exist for both its inception and symptom exacerbation once the disease is established. Factors underlying inception can range from viral respiratory tract infections in infancy to occupational exposures in adults. Factors underlying asthma exacerbations include allergen exposure in sensitized individuals, viral infections, exercise, irritants, and ingestion of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents among others. Exacerbating factors might include one or all of these exposures and vary both among and within patients. Asthma treatment is determined to a large extent after an assessment of severity, which can be variable over time and assessed in 2 domains: impairment (current) and risk (long-term consequences). Unfortunately, despite the availability of effective therapies, suboptimal asthma control exists in many patients on a worldwide basis. The future development of novel therapies and treatment paradigms should address these disparities.","Lemanske, Robert F.; Busse, William W.",J Allergy Clin Immunol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S009167490501643X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009167490501643X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16455346/,217

This paper presents evidence to suggest that strategic decision-making following a shock event involves a more intuitive, less analytical and less consultative approach, while decision-making in a stable environment is characterised by a more cooperative, formal and analytical process. Decision-making following a shock event tends to be simplified and fast, whereas decision-making in a stable environment tends to be comprehensive and slow. Furthermore, the strategic role of the board transforms following a shock event from a limited involvement in strategy setting to a strong involvement in the setting of strategy. This research has important management implications signifying that crisis management must increasingly focus on building an organisation's ability to reach swift decisions in crisis situations and avoid analysis paralysis.","Bonn, Ingrid; Rundle-Thiele, Sharyn",Tour Manag,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tourman.2006.04.021; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S026151770600077X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287721/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026151770600077X,217
599699,An effective screening and management process in the outpatient clinic for patients requiring hospitalization during the COVID‐19 pandemic,2020-04-21,"OBJECTIVES: The severity of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is largely determined by the immune response. First studies indicate altered lymphocyte counts and function. However, interactions of pro- and anti-inflammatory mechanisms remain elusive. In the current study we characterized the immune responses in patients suffering from severe COVID-19-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). METHODS: This was a single-center retrospective study in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with confirmed COVID-19 between March 14(th) and May 28(th) 2020 (n = 39). Longitudinal data were collected within routine clinical care, including flow-cytometry of lymphocyte subsets, cytokine analysis and growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15). Antibody responses against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Spike protein were analyzed. RESULTS: All patients suffered from severe ARDS, 30.8% died. Interleukin (IL)-6 was massively elevated at every time-point. The anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was concomitantly upregulated with IL-6. The cellular response was characterized by lymphocytopenia with low counts of CD8+ T cells, natural killer (NK) and naïve T helper cells. CD8+ T and NK cells recovered after 8 to 14 days. The B cell system was largely unimpeded. This coincided with a slight increase in anti-SARS-CoV-2-Spike-RBD immunoglobulin (Ig) G and a decrease in anti-SARS-CoV-2-Spike-RBD IgM. GDF-15 levels were elevated throughout ICU treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Massively elevated levels of IL-6 and a delayed cytotoxic immune defense characterized severe COVID-19-induced ARDS. The B cell response and antibody production were largely unimpeded. No obvious imbalance of pro- and anti-inflammatory mechanisms was observed, with elevated GDF-15 levels suggesting increased tissue resilience.","Notz, Quirin; Schmalzing, Marc; Wedekink, Florian; Schlesinger, Tobias; Gernert, Michael; Herrmann, Johannes; Sorger, Lena; Weismann, Dirk; Schmid, Benedikt; Sitter, Magdalena; Schlegel, Nicolas; Kranke, Peter; Wischhusen, Jörg; Meybohm, Patrick; Lotz, Christopher",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33123167/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.581338,217

The main objective of this pilot study is to explore the preliminary effectiveness of the SbS-F program to decrease participant-reported depressive symptoms compared to enhanced care as usual (ECAU); and the secondary objectives are to explore the preliminary effectiveness of the SbS-F to decrease participant-reported anxiety symptoms and improve wellbeing, and to evaluate the potential for SbS-F implementation in real-world settings. METHODS: This trial will follow an effectiveness-implementation hybrid type 1 trial design and utilize the Reach, Efficacy/Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework to accelerate the translation of clinical research into more effective implementation strategies and policies. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to control and treatment groups. Control group participants will receive ECAU that consists of brief depression psychoeducation and referral to local community partners. Treatment group participants will receive a 5-session of digital intervention through a mobile phone application. The primary outcome (depression) and psychological secondary outcomes (anxiety symptoms and wellbeing) will be measured using validated instruments. To evaluate study implementation, an embedded mixed-methods design will be used to collect data from various stakeholders. Data then will be analyzed using intention to treat principle and reported following the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guideline. DISCUSSION: This study will provide important new knowledge about the preliminary effectiveness of SbS-F, a mobile application, as a digital mental health intervention and its scalability. If SbS-F shows positive results among OFWs in Macao, it has strong potential to be used by OFWs in other countries that may also experience depression and difficulty accessing mental health services.

600265,A New Tool for Detecting COVID-19 Psychological Burden Among Postacute and Long-term Care Residents (Mood-5 Scale): Observational Study,2021-03-10,"BACKGROUND: Anopheles stephensi, an invasive malaria vector, was first detected in Africa nearly 10 years ago. After the initial finding in Djibouti, it has subsequently been found in Ethiopia, Sudan and Somalia. To better inform policies and vector control decisions, it is important to understand the distribution, bionomics, insecticide susceptibility, and transmission potential of An. stephensi. These aspects were studied as part of routine entomological monitoring in Ethiopia between 2018 and 2020. METHODS: Adult mosquitoes were collected using human landing collections, pyrethrum spray catches, CDC light traps, animal-baited tent traps, resting boxes, and manual aspiration from animal shelters. Larvae were collected using hand-held dippers. The source of blood in blood-fed mosquitoes and the presence of sporozoites was assessed through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Insecticide susceptibility was assessed for pyrethroids, organophosphates and carbamates. RESULTS: Adult An. stephensi were collected with aspiration, black resting boxes, and animal-baited traps collecting the highest numbers of mosquitoes. Although sampling efforts were geographically widespread, An. stephensi larvae were collected in urban and rural sites in eastern Ethiopia, but An. stephensi larvae were not found in western Ethiopian sites. Blood-meal analysis revealed a high proportion of blood meals that were taken from goats, and only a small proportion from humans. Plasmodium vivax was detected in wild-collected An. stephensi. High levels of insecticide resistance were detected to pyrethroids, carbamates and organophosphates. Pre-exposure to piperonyl butoxide increased susceptibility to pyrethroids. Larvae were found to be susceptible to temephos. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the bionomics, insecticide susceptibility and distribution of An. stephensi will improve the quality of a national response in Ethiopia and provide additional information on populations of this invasive species in Africa. Further work is needed to understand the role that An. stephensi will have in Plasmodium transmission and malaria case incidence. While additional data are being collected, national programmes can use the available data to formulate and operationalize national strategies against the threat of An. stephensi.

However, its importance is increasingly clear, given the serious disorders caused by its absence or dysfunction, e.g., greater susceptibility to infections, thromboembolism and cancer. Surgical techniques to preserve the spleen and maintain splenic function have become increasingly common. However, the morbidity and mortality associated with its absence and dysfunction are still high. We used the decellularization technique to obtain a viable splenic scaffold for recellularization in vitro and propose the idea of bioengineered spleen transplantation to the host. We observed the maintenance of important structural components such as white pulp, marginal zone and red pulp, in addition to the network of vascular ducts. The decellularized scaffold presents minimal residual DNA and SDS, which are essential to prevent immunogenic responses and transplantation failure. Also, the main components of the splenic matrix were preserved after decellularization, with retention of approximately 72% in the matrisomal protein content. The scaffold we developed was partially recellularized with stromal cells from the spleen of neonatal rats, demonstrating adhesion, proliferation and viability of cells. Therefore, the splenic scaffold is very promising for use in studies on spleen reconstruction and transplantation, with the aim of complete recovery of splenic function.","Zanardo, Tadeu Ériton Caliman; Amorim, Fernanda Gobbi; Taufner, Gabriel Henrique; Pereira, Rayssa Helena Arruda; Baiense, Ian Manhoni; Destefani, Afrânio Côgo; Iwai, Leo Kei; Maranhão, Raul Cavalcante; Nogueira, Breno Valentim",Front Bioeng Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33123515/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fbioe.2020.573461,217

However, there remains little knowledge regarding droplet dissemination during airway management procedures in real life settings. Methods: 12 different airway management procedures were investigated during routine clinical care. A high-speed video camera (1000 frames/second) was for imaging. Quantitative droplet characteristics as size, distance traveled, and velocity were computed. Results: Droplets were detected in 8/12 procedures. The droplet trajectories could be divided into two distinctive patterns (type 1/2). Type 1 represented a ballistic trajectory with higher speed droplets whereas type 2 represented a random trajectory of slower particles that persisted longer in air. Speaking and coughing lead to a larger amount of droplets than non-invasive ventilation therapy. The use of tracheal cannula filters reduced the amount of droplets. Conclusions: Respiratory droplet patterns generated during airway management procedures follow two distinctive trajectories based on the influence of aerodynamic forces. Speaking and coughing produce more droplets than non-invasive ventilation therapy confirming these behaviors as exposure risks. Even large droplets may exhibit patterns resembling the fluid dynamics smaller airborne aerosols that follow the airflow convectively and may place the healthcare provider at risk.","Mueller, S.

This systematic review sought to identify and synthesis available evidence to aid the understanding of the possible effect of vitamin D deficiency on COVID-19 status and health outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Methods: Three databases PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar were searched systematically to obtain English language journal article published within 1/12/2019 and 3/11/2020. The search consisted of the terms (""Vitamin D,"" OR ""25-Hydroxyvitamin D,"" OR ""Low Vitamin D."") AND (""COVID-19"" OR ""2019-nCoV"" OR ""Coronavirus"" OR ""SARS-CoV-2"") AND (""disease severity"" OR ""IMV"" OR ""ICU admission"" OR ""mortality"" OR ""hospitalization"" OR ""infection""). We followed the recommended PRISMA guidelines in executing this study. After going through the screening of the articles, eleven articles were included in the review. Findings: Almost all the included studies reported a positive association between Vitamin D sufficiency and COVID-19 status and health outcomes. Vitamin D deficient patients (< 25 ng/mL) are 5.84 times [aOR=6.84, p=0.01] more likely to die from COVID-19 compared to the vitamin D sufficient people. Another study also found that Vitamin D deficiency is associated with higher risk of death with Hazard ratio (HR) 14.73, p<0.001. Vitamin D deficient (<12 ng/mL) people were 2.2 times [aOR=3.2, p=0.07] more likely to develop severe COVID-19 after adjusting for age, gender, obesity, cardiac disease, and kidney disease compared to the vitamin D sufficient people. One study found that after controlling for confounders, patients with low 25(OH)D (<30 ng/mL) level are more likely [aOR=1.45, p=<0.001] to be COVID-19 infected compared to the patients with 25(OH)D level >=30 ng/mL. Conclusion: Findings from the study included suggest Vitamin D may serve as a mitigating effect for covid-19 infection, severity and mortality. We recommend the need to encourage people to eat foods rich in vitamin D such as fish, red meat, liver and egg yolks whiles at the same time providing vitamin D supplements for individuals with COVID-19 in order to boost their immune systems.","Das, P.; Samad, N.; Ahinkorah, B.

602176,How to transform a general hospital into an “infectious disease hospital” during the epidemic of COVID-19,2020-04-14,"Legionella longbeachae pneumonia is much less common than Legionella pneumophila pneumonia in most of the world and may evade timely diagnosis in settings that rely primarily on urine antigen testing, which detects Legionella pnuemophila serogroup 1 only. It is, however, widely recognized in Australia and New Zealand, where it is endemic and associated with exposure to compost and potting soils, rather than contaminated water systems as seen with L. pneumophila. L. longbeachae can cause a similar spectrum and severity of illness as L. pneumophila. Here we present a case of a 47-year-old man with L. longbeacheae necrotizing pneumonia following exposure to possibly contaminated soil from a wastewater treatment facility. Initial presentation included cough, chest pain, and dyspnea, and progressed to hypoxic respiratory failure, tension pneumothorax, and cardiac arrest. L. pneumophila urine antigen was negative, but bronchioalveolar lavage samples grew L. longbeachae on buffered charcoal yeast extract agar. A review of cases reported in the literature in non-endemic regions over a 20-year period identified 38 cases in Europe, 33 in Asia, and 8 in North America. Average age was 65, 65 % were male, and 35 % had potentially relevant environmental exposures. L. longbeachae should be considered in cases of severe community acquired pneumonia, particularly following a consistent environmental exposure or if initial testing for other pathogens is unrevealing. A thorough exposure history including questions about contact with potting soil or compost, and utilization of specialized agar for culture can both be key in identifying this pathogen.","Bell, Harrison; Chintalapati, Sai; Patel, Preet; Halim, Ameer; Kithas, Andrew; Schmalzle, Sarah A.",IDCases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33511033/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idcr.2021.e01050,217

We sought to explore this relationship among patients with multiple myeloma (MM) who were not considered for hematopoietic stem cell transplant in the first-line setting and how it varied over time. METHODS: We queried the National Cancer Database for patients diagnosed with MM between 2004 and 2016 and included only those who received systemic therapy as the first-line treatment. Enrollment rates for therapy were calculated as receipt of systemic therapy as the incident event of interest (numerator) over time to initiation of therapy (denominator) and used to calculate incident rate ratios that were further analyzed using Poisson regression analysis. A multivariate Cox proportional hazards model was constructed for survival analysis, and differences were reported as hazard ratios (HRs). RESULTS: We identified 56,102 patients for enrollment analysis and 50,543 patients for survival analysis. Therapy enrollment in a multivariate model was significantly impacted by race and sex (p < .005). Advanced age, earlier year of diagnosis, lack of insurance or Medicaid, and higher comorbidity were associated with poor survival (HR > 1), whereas female sex, non-Hispanic black race, higher income, and treatment at an academic center were associated with improved survival (HR < 1). CONCLUSION: Disparities in treatment of MM exist and are caused by a complex interplay of multiple factors, with socioeconomic factor playing a significant role. Studies exploring such determinants may help in equitable distribution of resources to overcome such differences.","Jayakrishnan, Thejus T.; Bakalov, Veli; Chahine, Zena; Lister, John; Wegner, Rodney E.; Sadashiv, Santhosh",Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Ther,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1658387620301527; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069693/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hemonc.2020.09.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1658387620301527?v=s5,217

To perform an epidemiological study of FNoV infection, it is necessary to develop a simple and effective method for virus detection. We investigated whether a commercial human NoV quantitative RT-PCR kit for the detection of human NoVs used in medical practice can be applied for FNoV detection. This kit was capable of detecting the FNoV gene regardless of the genogroup (GIV and GVI) in experimental and field samples. Based on the above findings, it is possible to detect FNoVs using human NoV tests.

605101,Neuropsychiatric disorders and COVID-19,2021-06-17,"Recently, a new respiratory infectious disease called COVID-19 has emerged and created a global emergency. It was initially linked to the animal-to-human transmission. However, it is now thought that COVID-19 is spreading through human-to-human transmission mainly via droplets. As there is no definite antiviral therapy for the treatment of cases with COVID-19 the best option for slowing down the pandemic and reducing mortality rates is protection against the virus of interest. To achieve this goal obtaining information about how first cases infected with COVID-19 is crucial. Hence, this study aims to review the studies published in peer-reviewed journals to report the first confirmed cases with COVID-19. Herein, we review the origin, symptoms, diagnostic tests, and progress of the disease and possible actions of authorities which would be effective in similar pandemics in the future. This study reviewed 13 cases (5 females and 8 males; 25-61 years old) from 10 countries. All cases have recovered from COVID-19. The results of this review suggested that timely reports of the confirmed cases, notifying World Health Organization and providing information to the general population about the methods of spreading the virus would have decreased the number of infected cases and mortality rates. In addition, the travel history of the first confirmed cases in various countries suggested that prompt actions in restricting travels and closing borders could be an efficient strategy in preventing the transmission of the disease outside of the affected sites. Efforts should be taken by health authorities for preparing the world for future epidemic/pandemic in terms of developing advanced screening strategies in the borders and diagnostic strategies for early identification of infected cases.","Sadeghmoghadam, Leila; Daneshfar, Majid; Sharifi, Farshad; Alizad, Vida",Respir Med Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32953445/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rmcr.2020.101219; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213007120304330?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213007120304330,217
605171,Challenges to Neurosurgical Residency Training during COVID-19 Pandemic: An Indian Perspective,2020-05-29,"Abstract The People's Republic of China increasingly has turned to political warfare and sharp power to influence U.S. policy toward China and on international issues that it considers important. This turn in part reflects the limited effectiveness of Beijing's much-increased hard power and its never-formidable and now-reduced soft power as means to achieve China's ends with the United States. China's political warfare and uses of sharp power pursue both direct influence on U.S. policy and indirect impact through affecting American attitudes toward China and China-related issues. China's efforts range across many sectors—including business, culture, media, education, and more—and they have prompted reactions and countermeasures. In China's view, the United States has long been engaged in something like political warfare or sharp power undertakings targeting China. If, or as, U.S.-China relations continue to become more adversarial, political warfare, uses of sharp power, and measures to counter them are likely to increase.","deLisle, Jacques",Orbis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0030438720300065; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.orbis.2020.02.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32292215/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0030438720300065,217
605306,Perceived declining physical and cognitive fitness during the COVID‐19 state of emergency among community‐dwelling Japanese old‐old adults,2021-02-11,"Abstract In this work, severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) genome BJ202 (AY864806) was completely sequenced. The genome was directly accessed from the stool sample of a patient in Beijing. Comparative genomics methods were used to analyze the sequence variations of 116 SARS-CoV genomes (including BJ202) available in the NCBI Gen-Bank. With the genome sequence of GZ02 as the reference, there were 41 polymorphic sites identified in BJ202 and a total of 278 polymorphic sites present in at least two of the 116 genomes. The distribution of the polymorphic sites was biased over the whole genome. Nearly half of the variations (50.4%, 140/278) clustered in the one third of the whole genome at the 3′ end (19.0 kb-29.7 kb). Regions encoding Orf10–11, Orf3/4, E, M and S protein had the highest mutation rates. A total of 15 PCR products (about 6.0 kb of the genome) including 11 fragments containing 12 known polymorphic sites and 4 fragments without identified polymorphic sites were cloned and sequenced. Results showed that 3 unique polymorphic sites of BJ202 (positions 13 804, 15 031 and 20 792) along with 3 other polymorphic sites (26 428, 26 477 and 27 243) all contained 2 kinds of nucleotides. It is interesting to find that position 18379 which has not been identified to be polymorphic in any of the other 115 published SARS-CoV genomes is actually a polymorphic site. The nucleotide composition of this site is A (8) to G (6). Among 116 SARS-CoV genomes, 18 types of deletions and 2 insertions were identified. Most of them were related to a 300 bp region (27 700–28 000) which encodes parts of the putative ORF9 and ORF10–11. A phylogenetic tree illustrating the divergence of whole BJ202 genome from 115 other completely sequenced SARS-CoVs was also constructed. BJ202 was phylogeneticly closer to BJ01 and LLJ-2004.","SHANG, Lei; QI, Yan; BAO, Qi-Yu; TIAN, Wei; XU, Jian-Cheng; FENG, Ming-Guang; YANG, Huan-Ming",Acta Genetica Sinica,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0379417206600619; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16625834/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0379417206600619,217

The coronaviruses contains the largest RNA genome among all other known RNA viruses, therefore the disease etiology can be understood by analyzing the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we used an ab-intio based computational tool VMir to scan the complete genome of SARS-CoV-2 to predict pre-miRNAs. The potential pre-miRNAs were identified by ViralMir and mature miRNAs were recognized by Mature Bayes. Additionally, predicted mature miRNAs were analysed against human genome by miRDB server to retrieve target genes. Besides that we also retrieved GO (Gene Ontology) terms for pathways, functions and cellular components. We predicted 26 mature miRNAs from genome of SARS-CoV-2 that targets human genes involved in pathways like EGF receptor signaling, apoptosis signaling, VEGF signaling, FGF receptor signaling. Gene enrichment tool analysis and substantial literature evidences suggests role of genes like BMPR2 and p53 in pulmonary vasculature and antiviral innate immunity respectively.

605712,Effect of Psychological–Behavioral Intervention on the Depression and Anxiety of COVID-19 Patients,2020-11-20,"BACKGROUND: A novel coronavirus of zoonotic origin (2019-nCoV) has recently been identified in patients with acute respiratory disease. This virus is genetically similar to SARS coronavirus and bat SARS-like coronaviruses. The outbreak was initially detected in Wuhan, a major city of China, but has subsequently been detected in other provinces of China. Travel-associated cases have also been reported in a few other countries. Outbreaks in health care workers indicate human-to-human transmission. Molecular tests for rapid detection of this virus are urgently needed for early identification of infected patients. METHODS: We developed two 1-step quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR assays to detect two different regions (ORF1b and N) of the viral genome. The primer and probe sets were designed to react with this novel coronavirus and its closely related viruses, such as SARS coronavirus. These assays were evaluated using a panel of positive and negative controls. In addition, respiratory specimens from two 2019-nCoV-infected patients were tested. RESULTS: Using RNA extracted from cells infected by SARS coronavirus as a positive control, these assays were shown to have a dynamic range of at least seven orders of magnitude (2x10(−4)-2000 TCID(50)/reaction). Using DNA plasmids as positive standards, the detection limits of these assays were found to be below 10 copies per reaction. All negative control samples were negative in the assays. Samples from two 2019-nCoV-infected patients were positive in the tests. CONCLUSIONS: The established assays can achieve a rapid detection of 2019n-CoV in human samples, thereby allowing early identification of patients.","Chu, Daniel K W; Pan, Yang; Cheng, Samuel M S; Hui, Kenrie P Y; Krishnan, Pavithra; Liu, Yingzhi; Ng, Daisy Y M; Wan, Carrie K C; Yang, Peng; Wang, Quanyi; Peiris, Malik; Poon, Leo L M",Clin Chem,https://doi.org/10.1093/clinchem/hvaa029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32031583/,217

We have here evaluated the predictive value of FDG PET/CT parameters prior to receiving anti-CD38-based therapy in RRMM cases. In 38 consecutive patients, the median PFS was 12.5 months and the median OS was not reached. The presence of >3 focal lesions (FLs) on relapse PET (n = 19) and the initial ISS were associated with both an inferior PFS (p = 0.0036 and p = 0.0026) and OS (p = 0.025 and p = 0.0098). In multivariable analysis, the ISS and >3 FLs were independent prognostic factors for PFS (p = 0.010 and p = 0.025). A prognostic score combining the ISS (1,2, or 3 points) and >3 FL (1 point) individualized an ultra-risk group (scored 3–4) with a median PFS and OS of 3.1 months and 8.5 months respectively vs. not reached for patients scored 1–2. Combined with the ISS, the presence of >3 FLs on PET could improve the risk stratification of RRMM patients. ABSTRACT: Although anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies have improved the prognosis of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM), some patients still experience early relapses with poor outcomes. This present study evaluated the predictive value of FDG PET/CT parameters for RRMM prior to initiating anti-CD38 treatment. We included 38 consecutive RRMM patients who underwent a PET/CT scan treated at our institution at relapse. The median PFS was 12.5 months and the median OS was not reached. 42% of the patients had an initial ISS score of 1, 37% of 2, and 21% of 3. The presence of >3 focal lesions (FLs, n = 19) and the ISS score were associated with inferior PFS (p = 0.0036 and p = 0.0026) and OS (p = 0.025 and p = 0.0098). Patients with >3 FLs had a higher initial ISS score (p = 0.028). In multivariable analysis, the ISS score and >3 FLs were independent prognostic factors for PFS (p = 0.010 and p = 0.025 respectively), and combined they individualized a high-risk group with a median PFS and OS of 3.1 months and 8.5 months respectively vs. not reached for the other patients.

Fibrinogen, as a biomarker for inflammation, cardiovascular disease, and coagulation, has not been fully investigated yet. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical application of fibrinogen in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the demographic and laboratory characteristics of 119 COVID-19 patients in the University of Alabama of Birmingham Medical Center. Correlations of fibrinogen on admission with intensive care unit (ICU) admission, disease severity, and laboratory parameters were analyzed. RESULTS: Among the 119 COVID-19 patients, 77.3% (92/119) had severe disease, and 59.5% (71/119) patients were admitted to the ICU. Elevated fibrinogen was detected in 67.2% (80/119) of the patients. Fibrinogen levels were significantly associated with inflammatory markers and disease severity, but not with cardiac injury biomarker high sensitivity troponin I. Patients with severe disease had increased fibrinogen levels upon admission compared to patients with non-severe disease (P = 0.001). Fibrinogen level at 528.0 mg/dl was the optimal cutoff to predict disease severity, with a sensitivity and specificity of 66.7% and 70.3% (area undty -60er the curve [AUC] 0.72, P = 0.0006).

Our results indicate that the S-, RBD-, and N- specific IgG generation of severe/critical COVID-19 patients is one week later than mild/moderate cases, while the levels of these antibodies are 1.5-fold higher in severe/critical patients during hospitalization (P<0.01). The decrease of these IgG levels indicates the poor outcome of severe/critical patients. The RBD- and S-specific IgG levels are 2-fold higher in virus-free patients (P<0.05). Notably, we found that the patients who got re-infected had a low level of protective antibody on discharge.

METHODS: A cross‐sectional study was designed. Twenty healthy healthcare workers were included in this study. Skin parameters including skin hydration, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), erythema, sebum secretion, pH, and skin temperature were measured in the RPE‐covered and RPE‐uncovered areas of the face 4 and 8 hours after wearing RPE and 14 hours after not wearing RPE. RESULTS: Skin hydration, TEWL, erythema, pH, and skin temperature increased in the RPE‐covered areas after wearing RPE for 4 and 8 hours. By contrast, in the RPE‐uncovered areas, skin hydration decreased and TEWL, erythema, and pH showed minimal changes over time. Based on the repeated‐measure analysis, the changes in skin physiological properties over time were significantly different between RPE‐covered and RPE‐uncovered areas.

The purpose of the study was to evaluate the role of hand-held ultrasound devices (visual stethoscopes) in the diagnosis of peripheral lung disease. Methods: We conducted a systematic search of literature comparing the diagnostic accuracy of truly hand-held ultrasound devices compared to conventional high-end ultrasound devices, chest X-rays, thoracic CT (computer tomography), or physical examinations to diagnose peripheral lung lesions. ScienceDirect, PubMed, and PubMed Central bibliographic databases were searched within a time limit of 15 years. Results: The applied search strategy retrieved 439 studies after removing duplicates; 34 were selected for full-text review, and 15 articles met all inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. When comparing hand-held ultrasound devices to chest X-rays, negative predictive values were above 90%, while positive predictive values tended to be lower (from 35% to 75.8%).

Conclusions: Being accessible, radiation-free, and comparatively easy to decontaminate, hand-held ultrasound devices could represent a reliable tool for evaluating peripheral lung diseases. This method can be successfully employed as an alternative to repeated X-ray examinations for peripheral lung disease monitoring.","Haji-Hassan, Mariam; Lenghel, Lavinia Manuela; Bolboacă, Sorana D.",Diagnostics (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics11081381; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34441315/,217

However, valid data on injuries and usage habits are not yet available. This retrospective two-center study included a total of 76 patients who presented to the emergency department following E-scooter-related accidents. The mean age was 34.3 ± 12.4 years and 69.7% of the patients were male. About half of the patients were admitted by ambulance (42.1%). Fractures were found in 48.6% of patients, and 27.6% required surgical treatment due to a fracture. The upper extremities were the most commonly affected body region, followed by injuries to the lower extremity and to the head and face. Only one patient had worn a helmet. In-hospital treatment was necessary for 26.3% of the cases. Patients presented to the emergency department mainly during the weekend and on-call times. This is the first report on E-scooter-related injuries in Germany. Accidents with E-scooters can cause serious injuries and, therefore, represent a further burden to emergency departments. The use of E-scooters appears to be mostly recreational, and the rate of use of protective gear is low.","Störmann, Philipp; Klug, Alexander; Nau, Christoph; Verboket, René D.; Leiblein, Max; Müller, Daniel; Schweigkofler, Uwe; Hoffmann, Reinhard; Marzi, Ingo; Lustenberger, Thomas",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32455862/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9051569,217

The current outbreak of the Coronavirus pandemic has significantly reduced outdoor activities and direct interpersonal relationships. Therefore, a higher use of VGs can become the response to stress and fear of illness. VGs and their practical, academic, vocational and educational implications have become an issue of increasing interest for scholars, parents, teachers, pediatricians and youth public policy makers. The current systematic review aims to identify, in recent literature, the most relevant problems of the complex issue of playing VGs in children and adolescents in order to provide suggestions for the correct management of VG practice. The method used searches through standardized search operators using keywords related to video games and the link with cognition, cognitive control and behaviors adopted during the pandemic. Ninety-nine studies were reviewed and included, whereas twelve studies were excluded because they were educationally irrelevant. Any debate on the effectiveness of VGs cannot refer to a dichotomous approach, according to which VGs are rigidly ‘good’ or ‘bad’. VGs should be approached in terms of complexity and differentiated by multiple dimensions interacting with each other.","Smirni, Daniela; Garufo, Elide; Di Falco, Luca; Lavanco, Gioacchino",Pediatr Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34287345/; https://doi.org/10.3390/pediatric13030047,217

PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of CHM or CHM combination therapy for COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis METHODS: We searched for relevant studies in the CNKI, CBM, Wanfang Data, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and other resources from their inception to April 15, 2020. Randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, and case-control studies on CHM or CHM combination therapy for COVID-19 were included. Meta-analysis was performed according to the Cochrane Handbook. RESULTS: Overall, 19 studies with 1474 patients were included. Meta-analysis showed that the overall clinical effectiveness (OR = 2.67, 95% CI 1.83-3.89, I(2) = 0%), improvement in the CT scan (OR = 2.43, 95% CI 1.80-3.29, I(2) = 0%), percentage of cases turning to severe/critical (OR = 0.40, 95% CI 0.24-0.67, I(2) = 17.1%), reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) negativity rate (OR = 2.55, 95% CI 1.06-6.17, I(2) = 56.4%) and disappearance rate of symptoms (fever, cough, and fatigue) were superior by combined CHM treatment of COVID-19. However, there was no statistical difference between the two groups in terms of length of hospital stay (WMD = -0.46, 95% CI -3.87 - 2.95, I(2) = 99.5%), and rate of adverse effects (OR = 1.21, 95% CI 0.48-3.07, I(2) = 43.5%).

We hypothesized that COVID-19 would cause a delay to surgery, with worse perioperative outcomes, compared to standard operations. All esophagectomies for esophageal cancer at a single institution from March-June 2020, COVID-19 group, and from 2019 were reviewed and peri-operative details were compared between groups. Ninety-six esophagectomies were performed in 2019 vs 37 during March-June 2020 (COVID-19 group). No differences between groups were found for preoperative comorbidities. Wait-time to surgery from final neoadjuvant treatment was similar, median 50 days in 2019 vs 53 days during COVID-19 p=0.601. There was no increased upstaging, from clinical stage to pathologic stage, 9.4% in 2019 vs 7.5% in COVID-19 p=0.841. Fewer overall complications occurred during COVID-19 vs 2019, 43.2% vs 64.6% p=0.031, but complications were similar by specific grades. Readmission rates were not statistically different during COVID-19 than 2019, 16.2% vs 10.4% p=0.38. No peri-operative mortalities or COVID-19 infections were seen in the COVID-19 group. Esophagectomy for esophageal cancer was not associated with worse outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic with minimal risk of infection when careful COVID-19 guidelines are followed.

METHODS: In our retrospective, multicenter cohort study, we compared patients with RRMS on EID (defined as ≥4-week delay of dose interval) with a control group on standard interval dosing (SID) at the same period (January to December 2020). RESULTS: Three hundred eighteen patients with RRMS were longitudinally evaluated in 5 German centers. One hundred sixteen patients received ocrelizumab on EID (median delay [interquartile range 8.68 [5.09–13.07] weeks). Three months after the last ocrelizumab infusion, 182 (90.1%) patients following SID and 105 (90.5%) EID patients remained relapse free (p = 0.903). Three-month confirmed progression of disability was observed in 18 SID patients (8.9%) and 11 EID patients (9.5%, p = 0.433). MRI progression was documented in 9 SID patients (4.5%) and 8 EID patients (6.9%) at 3-month follow-up (p = 0.232). Multivariate logistic regression showed no association between treatment regimen and no evidence of disease activity status at follow-up (OR: 1.266 [95% CI: 0.695–2.305]; p = 0.441). Clinical stability was accompanied by persistent peripheral CD19(+) B-cell depletion in both groups (SID vs EID: 82.6% vs 83.3%, p = 0.463). Disease activity in our cohort was not associated with CD19(+) B-cell repopulation. CONCLUSION: Our data support EID of ocrelizumab as potential risk mitigation strategy in times of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The ɛSIP molecule consisted of a single‐chain antibody (scFv) specific for the porcine coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) linked to the ɛ‐CH4 domain from human immunoglobulin E (IgE). In some constructs, the sequence encoding the ɛSIP molecule was flanked by the leader peptide from the original murine antibody at its N‐terminus and an endoplasmic reticulum retention signal (HDEL) at its C‐terminus to allow the expressed protein to be directed to, and retained within, the endoplasmic reticulum. Western blot analysis of samples from Nicotiana clevelandii or cowpea tissue infected with constructs revealed the presence of SIP molecules which retained their ability to dimerize. The analysis of crude plant extracts revealed that the plant‐expressed ɛSIP molecules could bind to and neutralize TGEV in tissue culture, the levels of binding and neutralization reflecting the level of expression. Oral administration of crude extracts from SIP‐expressing plant tissue to 2‐day‐old piglets demonstrated that the extracts which showed the highest levels of in vitro neutralization could also provide in vivo protection against challenge with TGEV.","Monger, Wendy; Alamillo, Josefa M.; Sola, Isabel; Perrin, Yolande; Bestagno, Marco; Burrone, Oscar R.; Sabella, Patricia; Plana‐Duran, Joan; Enjuanes, Luis; Garcia, Juan A.; Lomonossoff, George P.",Plant Biotechnol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17309733/,217

614059,Providing Comfort through Music to People Amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic as a Humanitarian Disaster.,2021-08-10,"Background: In autumn 2020, many countries, including the Netherlands, are experiencing a second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Health policymakers are struggling with choosing the right mix of measures to keep the COVID-19 case numbers under control, but still allow a minimum of social and economic activity. The priority to keep schools open is high, but the role of school-based contacts in the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 is incompletely understood. We used a transmission model to estimate the impact of school contacts on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and to assess the effects of school-based measures, including school closure, on controlling the pandemic at different time points during the pandemic. Methods and Findings: The age-structured model was fitted to age-specific seroprevalence and hospital admission data from the Netherlands during spring 2020. Compared to adults older than 60 years, the estimated susceptibility was 23% (95%CrI 20-28%) for children aged 0 to 20 years and 61% (95%CrI 50%-72%) for the age group of 20 to 60 years. The time points considered in the analyses were (i) August 2020 when the effective reproduction number (R_e) was estimated to be 1.31 (95%CrI 1.15-2.07), schools just opened after the summer holidays and measures were reinforced with the aim to reduce R_e to a value below 1, and (ii) November 2020 when measures had reduced R_e to 1.00 (95%CrI 0.94-1.33). In this period schools remained open. Our model predicts that keeping schools closed after the summer holidays, in the absence of other measures, would have reduced R_e by 10% (from 1.31 to 1.18 (95%CrI 1.04-1.83)) and thus would not have prevented the second wave in autumn 2020. Reducing non-school-based contacts in August 2020 to the level observed during the first wave of the pandemic would have reduced R_e to 0.83 (95%CrI 0.75-1.10). Yet, this reduction was not achieved and the observed R_e in November was 1.00. Our model predicts that closing schools in November 2020 could reduce R_e from the observed value of 1.00 to 0.84 (95%CrI 0.81-0.90), with unchanged non-school based contacts. Reductions in R_e due to closing schools in November 2020 were 8% for 10 to 20 years old children, 5% for 5 to 10 years old children and negligible for 0 to 5 years old children. Conclusions: The impact of measures reducing school-based contacts, including school closure, depends on the remaining opportunities to reduce non-school-based contacts. If opportunities to reduce R_e with non-school-based measures are exhausted or undesired and R_e is still close to 1, the additional benefit of school-based measures may be considerable, particularly among the older school children.","Rozhnova, G.; van Dorp, C.

There is a global ambience of uncertainty and anxiety. In addition, nations have imposed strict and restrictive public health measures including lockdowns. In this heightened time of vulnerability, public cooperation to preventive measures depends on trust and confidence in the health system. Trust is the optimistic acceptance of the vulnerability in the belief that the health system has best intentions. On the other hand, confidence is assessed based on previous experiences with the health system. Trust and confidence in the health system motivate people to accept the public health interventions and cooperate with them. Building trust and confidence therefore becomes an ethical imperative. This article analyses the COVID-19 pandemic in the south Indian state of Tamil Nadu and the state’s response to this pandemic. Further, it applies the Trust-Confidence-Cooperation framework of risk management to analyse the influence of public trust and confidence on the Tamil Nadu health system in the context of the preventive strategies adopted by the state.

614571,Managing Bipolar Disorder patients during COVID‐19 outbreak,2020-10-15,"Modeling the impact of amino acid mutations on protein-protein interaction plays a crucial role in protein engineering and drug design. In this study, we develop GeoPPI, a novel structure-based deep-learning framework to predict the change of binding affinity upon mutations. Based on the three-dimensional structure of a protein, GeoPPI first learns a geometric representation that encodes topology features of the protein structure via a self-supervised learning scheme. These representations are then used as features for training gradient-boosting trees to predict the changes of protein-protein binding affinity upon mutations. We find that GeoPPI is able to learn meaningful features that characterize interactions between atoms in protein structures. In addition, through extensive experiments, we show that GeoPPI achieves new state-of-the-art performance in predicting the binding affinity changes upon both single- and multi-point mutations on six benchmark datasets. Moreover, we show that GeoPPI can accurately estimate the difference of binding affinities between a few recently identified SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S protein. These results demonstrate the potential of GeoPPI as a powerful and useful computational tool in protein design and engineering.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 66 patients with hip fracture over the age of 60 years, presented between 1st March and 15th May 2020 and matched with the patients with hip fractures (75 patients) managed during the corresponding period in 2019 as control. Data was collected on demographics, comorbidities, COVID-19 status, procedures and mortality and complications. RESULTS: Thirty-day mortality following hip surgery was 13.6% during COVID-19 pandemic with all the mortalities in patients with ASA Grade 3 and 4. Mortality was considerably high for intracapsular fracture (20%) but highest in cemented hemiarthroplasty (20%). One third of the hip fractures operated in COVID-19 designated theatre died within 30 days of surgery. Thirty-day mortality rate for COVID-19 positive hip fracture patients were 55.5%. There has been higher 30-day mortality for hip surgeries during COVID-19 pandemic with positive correlation between patient’s COVID-19 test status and 30-day mortality following hip surgeries. CONCLUSION: There is strong association between 30-day mortality and the designated theatre (Clean/COVID) where the patients were operated on with higher mortality for intracapsular neck of femur fractures with significant mortality associated with cemented hemiarthroplasty particularly among symptomatic or COVID-19 positive patients. Therefore, adoption of a multidisciplinary approach is recommended to optimally balance the risk-benefit ratio for planning of management of hip fractures while considering patient’s peri-operative outcomes.","De, C; Harbham, PK; Postoyalko, C; Bhavanasi, B; Paringe, V; Theivendran, K",Malays Orthop J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34429830/; https://doi.org/10.5704/moj.2107.016,217

The results show a significant increase in WOB due to face masks, which is more severe in higher activity levels. The added WOB is considerable during physical activity and may be intolerable for patients with preexisting lung disease and may contribute to inspiratory muscle fatigue and dyspnea. Moreover, in this study, the effects of the physical properties of a fibrous medium, including thickness, porosity, and fiber diameter, are analyzed on the particle filtration efficiency (PFE) and the added WOB.

We highlight the issues of historical mistrust in the USA and how this may impact Black populations’ participation in COVID-19 vaccination trials. We provide recommendations for researchers to ethically engage Black populations in research considering the current context. Our recommendations include understanding the impact of ongoing trauma, acknowledging historical context, ensuring diverse research teams and engaging in open and honest conversations with Black populations to better address their needs. The core of our recommendation is recognising the impact of trauma in our research and health care practices.","Crooks, Natasha; Donenberg, Geri; Matthews, Alicia",J Med Ethics,https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2020-107054; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33547181/,217
615985,Sociodemographic inequality in COVID-19 vaccination coverage among elderly adults in England: a national linked data study,2021-07-23,"BACKGROUND: NCIT are non-invasive devices for fever screening in children. However, evidence of their accuracy for fever screening in adults is lacking. This study aimed to compare the accuracy of non-contact infrared thermometers (NCIT) with temporal artery thermometers (TAT) in an adult hospital. METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted on a convenience sample of non-infectious inpatients in two Australian hospitals. NCIT and TAT devices were used to collect body temperature recordings. Participant characteristics included age, gender, skin colour, highest temperature and antipyretic medications recorded in last 24-hours. RESULTS: In 265 patients, a mean difference of ±0.26°C was recorded between the NCIT (36.64°C) and the reference TAT (36.90°C) temperature devices. Bland-Altman analysis showed that NCIT and TAT temperatures were closely aligned at temperatures <37.5°C, but not at temperatures >37.5°C. NCIT had low sensitivity (16.13%) at temperatures ≥37.5°C. An AUROC score of 0.67 (SD 0.05) demonstrated poor accuracy of the NCIT device at temperatures ≥37.5°C. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to compare accuracy of NCIT thermometers to TAT in adult patients. Although mass fever screening is currently underway using NCIT, these results indicate that the NCIT may not be the most accurate device for fever mass screening during a pandemic.","Khan, Dr Shahrukh; Saultry, Ms Bridey; Adams, Dr Scott; Kouzani, Dr Abbas Z.; Decker, Ms Kelly; Digby, Dr Robin; Bucknall, Alfred Deakin Professor Tracey",Am J Infect Control,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33017627/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655320308920?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2020.09.012; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655320308920,217

It is noteworthy that vaccine efficacy depends not only on the vaccine but also on characteristics of the vaccinated. Over the past 30 years, a series of studies has documented the impact of psychological factors on the immune system’s vaccine response. Robust evidence has demonstrated that stress, depression, loneliness, and poor health behaviors can impair the immune system’s response to vaccines, and this effect may be greatest in vulnerable groups such as the elderly. Psychological factors are also implicated in the prevalence and severity of vaccine-related side effects. These findings have generalized across many vaccine types and therefore may be relevant to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. In this review, we discuss these psychological and behavioral risk factors for poor vaccine responses, their relevance to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as targeted psychological and behavioral interventions to boost vaccine efficacy and reduce side effects. Recent data suggest these psychological and behavioral risk factors are highly prevalent during the COVID-19 pandemic, but intervention research suggests that psychological and behavioral interventions can increase vaccine efficacy.","Madison, Annelise A.; Shrout, M.

616975,Prevalence and clinical correlates of COVID-19 outbreak among healthcare workers in a tertiary level hospital,2020-07-24,"INTRODUCTION: Covid-19 is a triphasic disorder first typified by a viral phase that lasts from the first onset of symptoms until seven days later. This is followed by a second and third phase, initially characterized by the appearance of lung infiltrates, followed in 20% by respiratory failure. The second phase is usually heralded by an elevation of serologic inflammatory markers including CRP, ferritin, IL-6, LDH as well as D-dimers. Approximately 20% proceed to the second phase and are usually then treated with dexamethasone, provided they are oxygen-dependent since these are the only cases that benefit from dexamethasone. If we had objective criteria to predict this 20% that develop severe illness, they could preemptively be treated with steroids. In this exploratory study we investigated the early use of preemptive steroids in the setting of early disease, in high-risk non-oxygen dependent cases. METHODS: Eligible patients were those 21 years or older with a diagnosis of Covid-19 and oxygen saturation ≥91%. For patients to be classified as high-risk, they had to exhibit two or more of the following abnormalities 7-10 days after first symptom: IL-6 ≥ 10 pg/ml, ferritin > 500 ng/ml, D-dimer > 1 mg/L (1,000 ng/ml), CRP > 10 mg/dL (100 mg/L), LDH above normal range lymphopenia (absolute lymphocyte count <1,000 /μL), oxygen saturation between 91-94%, or CT chest with evidence of ground glass infiltrates. Primary endpoint was progression to respiratory failure. CALL score method was used to predict the expected number of cases of respiratory failure. High risk patients received methylprednisolone (MPS) 80 mg IV daily x 5 days starting no earlier than seven days from first onset of symptoms. The primary endpoint was progression to hypoxemic respiratory failure defined as PaO2 <60 mm Hg or oxygen saturation ≤90%. Secondary endpoints included survival at 28 days from registration, admission to intensive care and live discharge from the hospital. Change in levels of inflammatory markers and length of hospitalization were also assessed. RESULTS: In 76 patients, the expected number with respiratory failure was 30 (39.5%), yet only 4 (5.3%) developed that complication (p=.00001). Survival at 28 days was 98.6%. Improvement in inflammatory markers correlated with favorable outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Our results are encouraging and suggest that this approach is both effective and safe.","Cabanillas 1,5, Fernando; Morales 2, Javier; Conde 3, José G.; Bertrán-Pasarell 1, Jorge; Fernández 4, Ricardo; Hernandez-Silva 5, Yaimara; Liboy 5, Idalia; Bryan-Díaz 5, James; Arraut-Gonzalez 5, Juan",medRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.08.21253117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33758884/; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.08.21253117v1?rss=1,217
617456,Teledermatology in the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review,2021-08-02,"BACKGROUND: Spain is one of the European countries most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Serological surveys are a valuable tool to assess the extent of the epidemic, given the existence of asymptomatic cases and little access to diagnostic tests. This nationwide population-based study aims to estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Spain at national and regional level. METHODS: 35 883 households were selected from municipal rolls using two-stage random sampling stratified by province and municipality size, with all residents invited to participate. From April 27 to May 11, 2020, 61 075 participants (75·1% of all contacted individuals within selected households) answered a questionnaire on history of symptoms compatible with COVID-19 and risk factors, received a point-of-care antibody test, and, if agreed, donated a blood sample for additional testing with a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay. Prevalences of IgG antibodies were adjusted using sampling weights and post-stratification to allow for differences in non-response rates based on age group, sex, and census-tract income. Using results for both tests, we calculated a seroprevalence range maximising either specificity (positive for both tests) or sensitivity (positive for either test). FINDINGS: Seroprevalence was 5·0% (95% CI 4·7–5·4) by the point-of-care test and 4·6% (4·3–5·0) by immunoassay, with a specificity–sensitivity range of 3·7% (3·3–4·0; both tests positive) to 6·2% (5·8–6·6; either test positive), with no differences by sex and lower seroprevalence in children younger than 10 years (<3·1% by the point-of-care test). There was substantial geographical variability, with higher prevalence around Madrid (>10%) and lower in coastal areas (<3%). Seroprevalence among 195 participants with positive PCR more than 14 days before the study visit ranged from 87·6% (81·1–92·1; both tests positive) to 91·8% (86·3–95·3; either test positive). In 7273 individuals with anosmia or at least three symptoms, seroprevalence ranged from 15·3% (13·8–16·8) to 19·3% (17·7–21·0). Around a third of seropositive participants were asymptomatic, ranging from 21·9% (19·1–24·9) to 35·8% (33·1–38·5). Only 19·5% (16·3–23·2) of symptomatic participants who were seropositive by both the point-of-care test and immunoassay reported a previous PCR test. INTERPRETATION: The majority of the Spanish population is seronegative to SARS-CoV-2 infection, even in hotspot areas. Most PCR-confirmed cases have detectable antibodies, but a substantial proportion of people with symptoms compatible with COVID-19 did not have a PCR test and at least a third of infections determined by serology were asymptomatic. These results emphasise the need for maintaining public health measures to avoid a new epidemic wave.

618478,Antimicrobial activity of novel synthesized coumarin based transitional metal complexes,2016-11-24,"BACKGROUND: Assessment of the effect of influenza on populations, including risk of infection, illness if infected, illness severity, and consultation rates, is essential to inform future control and prevention. We aimed to compare the community burden and severity of seasonal and pandemic influenza across different age groups and study years and gain insight into the extent to which traditional surveillance underestimates this burden. METHODS: Using preseason and postseason serology, weekly illness reporting, and RT-PCR identification of influenza from nasal swabs, we tracked the course of seasonal and pandemic influenza over five successive cohorts (England 2006–11; 5448 person-seasons' follow-up). We compared burden and severity of seasonal and pandemic strains. We weighted analyses to the age and regional structure of England to give nationally representative estimates. We compared symptom profiles over the first week of illness for different strains of PCR-confirmed influenza and non-influenza viruses using ordinal logistic regression with symptom severity grade as the outcome variable. FINDINGS: Based on four-fold titre rises in strain-specific serology, on average influenza infected 18% (95% CI 16–22) of unvaccinated people each winter. Of those infected there were 69 respiratory illnesses per 100 person-influenza-seasons compared with 44 per 100 in those not infected with influenza. The age-adjusted attributable rate of illness if infected was 23 illnesses per 100 person-seasons (13–34), suggesting most influenza infections are asymptomatic. 25% (18–35) of all people with serologically confirmed infections had PCR-confirmed disease. 17% (10–26) of people with PCR-confirmed influenza had medically attended illness. These figures did not differ significantly when comparing pandemic with seasonal influenza. Of PCR-confirmed cases, people infected with the 2009 pandemic strain had markedly less severe symptoms than those infected with seasonal H3N2. INTERPRETATION: Seasonal influenza and the 2009 pandemic strain were characterised by similar high rates of mainly asymptomatic infection with most symptomatic cases self-managing without medical consultation. In the community the 2009 pandemic strain caused milder symptoms than seasonal H3N2.

619255,A strategy for management of ECT patients during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020-05-12,"INTRODUCTION: The English government approved both stages of early medical abortion (EMA), using mifepristone and misoprostol under 10 weeks’ gestation, for at-home use on 30 March 2020. MSI Reproductive Choices UK (MSUK), one of the largest providers of abortion services in England, launched a no-test telemedicine EMA pathway on 6 April 2020. The objectives of this study were to report key patient-reported outcome measures and to assess whether our sample was representative of the whole population receiving no-test telemedicine EMA. METHODS: A sample of all MSUK’s telemedicine EMA patients between April and August 2020 were invited to opt in to a follow-up call to answer clinical and satisfaction questions. A total of 1243 (13.7% of all telemedicine EMAs) were successfully followed-up, on average within 5 days post-procedure. RESULTS: Patients reported high confidence in telemedicine EMA and high satisfaction with the convenience, privacy and ease of managing their abortion at home. The sample responding were broadly equivalent to the whole population receiving telemedicine. No patient reported that they were unable to consult privately. The majority (1035, 83%) of patients reported preferring the telemedicine pathway, with 824 (66%) indicating that they would choose telemedicine again if COVID-19 were no longer an issue. CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine EMA is a valued, private, convenient and more accessible option that is highly acceptable for patients seeking an abortion, especially those for whom in-clinic visits are logistically or emotionally challenging. Evidence that this pathway would be a first choice again in future for most patients supports the case to make telemedicine EMA permanent.","Porter Erlank, Chelsey; Lord, Jonathan; Church, Kathryn",BMJ Sex Reprod Health,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjsrh-2020-200954; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33602718/,217

Korea’s ability to rapidly achieve disease control in early 2020 without a “Great Lockdown” despite its proximity to China and high population density make its achievement particularly intriguing. This paper helps explain Korea’s pre-existing capabilities which enabled the rapid and effective implementation of its COVID-19 control strategies. A systematic assessment across multiple domains demonstrates that South Korea’s advantages in controlling its epidemic are owed tremendously to legal and organizational reforms enacted after the MERS outbreak in 2015. Successful implementation of the Korean strategy required more than just a set of actions, measures and policies. It relied on a pre-existing legal framework, financing arrangements, governance and a workforce experienced in outbreak management.","Yoo, Katelyn J.; Kwon, Soonman; Choi, Yoonjung; Bishai, David M.",Health Policy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2021.02.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33692005/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168851021000543; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168851021000543?v=s5,217

Methods for creating customized pathogens that can evade an immune system or work around a conventional antibiotic are discussed. In addition, emerging trends in synthetic biology are discussed. Biological warfare and bioterrorism are multifaceted problems requiring multifaceted solutions. Fortunately, the same advances in genomic biotechnologies that can be used to create bioweapons can also be used to set up countermeasures against them. We currently have in place sophisticated and well-developed biosecurity and biodefense programs. These programs are essential to countering the asymmetric warfare threat, but they are costly and perishable. Future directions in biosecurity and biodefense may very well be determined by the “next event.” However, the most likely events are those that naturally and accidentally threaten human and animal health through the emergence of novel pathogens and the reemergence of others in light of new environmental or societal factors.","Ryan, Jeffrey R.",Biosecurity and Bioterrorism,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128020296000141; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128020296000141,217

The purpose of the study is to promote the interoperability of machine learning algorithms with IoT technology by interacting with a population and its environment to curtail the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the study also investigates and discusses some solution frameworks, which can generate, capture, store, and analyze data using machine learning algorithms. These algorithms can detect, prevent, and trace the spread of COVID-19 and provide a better understanding of the disease in smart cities. Similarly, the study outlined case studies on the application of machine learning to help fight against COVID-19 in hospitals worldwide. The framework proposed in the study is a comprehensive presentation on the major components needed to integrate the machine learning approach with other AI-based solutions.

CVI is associated with poor educational and mental health outcomes. An intervention has been developed to help children with CVI, involving input from clinicians, teachers and parents. The effectiveness of this intervention needs to be evaluated. This study aims to guide any refinements to the intervention or the design of a future cluster-randomised trial that may be needed. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study will include all methods anticipated for a future cluster-randomised controlled trial. Eight primary schools will be recruited and randomised to receive the intervention or carry on with usual practice. The intervention will comprise an information pack for schools and access to a local paediatric ophthalmology clinic (who are prepared to assess them for CVI), for up to 5% of participating children. Outcome assessments will be carried out at baseline (before randomisation) and after 4–5 months of intervention period. Assessments will include children’s self-reported quality of life, their learning ability and behaviour as reported by teachers, and family functioning reported by parents. Cost data will include service use, family expenditure on additional support (eg, private appointments and administration) and school spending and resource used in helping children with special educational needs or disability. A process evaluation (PE) will collect additional data relating to the implementation of the intervention and the trial processes, in the school and clinic settings. The protocol for the PE will be reported separately. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical permission was obtained from the University of Bristol Faculty of Health Sciences Ethical Committee.

Despite the lack of complete carbohydrate processing, the recombinant S protein exhibited antigenic properties similar to TGEV S and induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies in immunized rats. Engineering a deletion (70 amino acids) into the carboxy-terminus containing the membrane anchor of the polypeptide allowed its secretion.

This Commentary further proposes that use of Digital Health Technologies, (i.e., to deploy telemedicine, telehealth, and telerehabilitation), can enhance rehabilitation opportunities. The authors set-forth their vision for a comprehensive web portal that will serve as a primary resource for evidence-based practice, information on guidelines, care pathways, and protocols of SCI management. At any stage during the acute management of SCI and following discharge, rehabilitation specialists could conduct remote consultation with persons with SCI and acute care specialists via the web portal, allowing timely access to specialist input and better clinical outcomes.

On average, the confinement was not associated with a deterioration in lifestyle risk factors (smoking, alcohol intake, diet, or weight), except for a decreased physical activity and increased sedentary time, which reversed with the end of confinement. However, chronic pain worsened, and moderate declines in mental health, that did not seem to reverse after restrictions were lifted, were observed. Males, older adults with greater social isolation or greater feelings of loneliness, those with poorer housing conditions, as well as those with a higher prevalence of chronic morbidities were at increased risk of developing unhealthier lifestyles or mental health declines with confinement. On the other hand, previously having a greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet and doing more physical activity protected older adults from developing unhealthier lifestyles with confinement. If another lockdown were imposed during this or future pandemics, public health programs should specially address the needs of older individuals with male sex, greater social isolation, sub-optimal housing conditions, and chronic morbidities because of their greater vulnerability to the enacted movement restrictions.","García-Esquinas, Esther; Ortolá, Rosario; Gine-Vázquez, Iago; Carnicero, José A.; Mañas, Asier; Lara, Elvira; Alvarez-Bustos, Alejandro; Vicente-Rodriguez, German; Sotos-Prieto, Mercedes; Olaya, Beatriz; Garcia-Garcia, Francisco José; Gusi, Narcis; Banegas, Jose R.; Rodríguez-Gómez, Irene; Struijk, Ellen A.; Martínez-Gómez, David; Lana, Alberto; Haro, Josep María; Ayuso-Mateos, José Luis; Rodríguez-Mañas, Leocadio; Ara, Ignacio; Miret, Marta; Rodríguez-Artalejo, Fernando",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18137067; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34281004/,217

Little is known regarding the detailed clinical features of B.1.1.7 variant infection. Data on 74 COVID-19 cases from two outbreaks in two districts of Beijing, China were extracted from a cloud database, including 41 cases from Shunyi District (Shunyi B.1.470 group) and 33 from Daxing (Daxing B.1.1.7 group) from December 25, 2020 to January 17, 2021. We conducted a comparison of the clinical characteristics. Seven clinical indicators of the Daxing B.1.1.7 group were significantly higher than those of the Shunyi group, including the proportion with fever over 38°C, the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid A (SAA), creatine kinase (CK), d-dimer (DD), and CD4+ T lymphocytes (CD4+ T), and the proportion with ground-glass opacity (GGO) in the lung (P values of ≤0.05). After adjusting for age, B.1.1.7 variant infection was a risk factor for elevated CRP (P = 0·045), SAA (P = 0·011), CK (P = 0·034), and CD4+ T (P = 0.029) and for the presence of GGO (P = 0.005). The median threshold cycle (CT) value of reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) tests of the N gene target in the Daxing B.1.1.7 group was significantly lower (P = 0.036) than that in the Shunyi B.1.470 group. Clinical features, including a more serious inflammatory response, pneumonia, and a possibly higher viral load, were detected in the cases infected with B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2. The B.1.1.7 variant may have increased pathogenicity. IMPORTANCE The SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant, which was first identified in the United Kingdom, has increased sharply in numbers worldwide and was reported to be more contagious than the nonvariant. To our knowledge, no studies investigating the detailed clinical features of COVID-19 cases infected with the B.1.1.7 variant have been published. Local epidemics have rarely occurred in China, but occasionally, a small clustered outbreak triggered by an imported SARS-CoV-2 strain with only one chain of transmission could happen. From late 2020 to early 2021, two clustered COVID-19 outbreaks occurred in Beijing, one of which was caused by the B.1.1.7 variant. The COVID-19 patients from the two outbreaks received similar clinical tests, diagnoses, and treatments. We found that the B.1.1.7 variant infection could lead to a more serious inflammatory response, acute response process, more severe pneumonia, and probably higher viral loads. This therefore implies that the B.1.1.7 variant may have increased pathogenicity.","Song, Yang; Ge, Ziruo; Cui, Shuping; Tian, Di; Wan, Gang; Zhu, Shuangli; Wang, Xianbo; Wang, Yu; Zhao, Xiang; Xiang, Pan; Xu, Yanli; Zhang, Tingyu; Liu, Long; Liu, Gang; Wang, Yanhai; Tan, Jianbo; Zhang, Wei; Xu, Wenbo; Chen, Zhihai",Microbiol Spectr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34346755/; https://doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.00273-21,217

Despite ongoing efforts, antiviral drugs to treat many of the most troubling viruses have not been approved yet. The recent launch of new antimicrobials is generating hope as more and more pathogens around the world become resistant to available drugs. But extra effort is still needed. One of the current strategies for antiviral and antibiotic drug development is the search for host cellular pathways used by many different pathogens. For example, many viruses and bacteria alter lipid synthesis and transport to build their own organelles inside infected cells. The characterization of these interactions will be fundamental to identify new targets for antiviral and antibiotic drug development. This review discusses how viruses and bacteria subvert cell machineries for lipid synthesis and transport and summarises the most promising compounds that interfere with these pathways.","Fernández‐Oliva, Alberto; Ortega‐González, Paula; Risco, Cristina",Cell Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30585688/; https://doi.org/10.1111/cmi.12996,217

METHODS: The electronic notes were reviewed for six patients being followed up by the Rheumatology service at Auckland District Health Board. Three patients were initially diagnosed and treated in neighbouring Counties Manukau District Health Board and later transferred to Auckland District Health Board. All had different initial treating clinicians at a time before any predefined treatment algorithm. Emphasis was placed on initial diagnosis and treatment, subsequent disease activity and changes in management. Local management was compared retrospectively with existing evidence relating to the treatment of anti-MDA-5 DM with ILD. Ethical approval was not obtained, according to the New Zealand Health and Disability Ethics Committee exemption for audits and related activities. RESULTS: Six patients with a variety of clinical presentations were identified appropriately as having anti-MDA-5 DM with ILD. They were commenced on different immunosuppressive regimens, with treatment adjusted according to response and on-going disease activity. Four have achieved clinical and biochemical remission, a fifth has improving active disease, and the sixth is in the early stages of their illness. CONCLUSION: Anti-MDA-5 DM is commonly associated with ILD. This can be rapidly progressive, with a poor prognosis in spite of treatment, particularly among Asian patients. Disease activity can seemingly be monitored with serum ferritin. The most effective management of this condition remains poorly researched; however, increasing retrospective evidence favours early aggressive multi-agent immunosuppression and a low threshold for escalation of therapy.","Dick, Michael; Martin, Julia; Tugnet, Nicola",Rheumatol Adv Pract,https://doi.org/10.1093/rap/rkab024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33898921/,217

COVID-19 vaccines need more time to be properly protective, especially in front of people refusing to get vaccinated. A modified multi-stage SEIR model, with distinct reproductive numbers corresponding to before and after lockdown is employed to predict the potential of a new pandemic wave. First, the two-stage model employed to find the best fitting for the reproductive numbers. Then, the model is extended to three-stage one to investigate the relaxation. However, the modified model detects a second wave in early stage from 28th May to 17th June 2020 before even succeeding controlling the first outbreak. Subsequently, the four-stage SEIR model is used to predict the end of the second wave.

In addition, it has been shown that response to drugs is strongly sex-dependent, both in terms of efficacy and toxicity. To expand current knowledge on sex differences in the expression of genes relevant for drug response, we generated a catalogue of differentially expressed human transcripts encoded by 289 genes in 41 human tissues from 838 adult individuals of the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx, v8 release) and focused our analysis on relevant transcripts implicated in drug response. We detected significant sex-differentiated expression of 99 transcripts encoded by 59 genes in the tissues most relevant for human pharmacology (liver, lung, kidney, small intestine terminal ileum, skin not sun-exposed, and whole blood). Among them, as expected, we confirmed significant differences in the expression of transcripts encoded by the cytochromes in the liver, CYP2B6, CYP3A7, CYP3A5, and CYP1A1. Our systematic investigation on differences between male and female in the expression of drug response-related genes, reinforce the need to overcome the sex bias of clinical trials.","Idda, Maria Laura; Campesi, Ilaria; Fiorito, Giovanni; Vecchietti, Andrea; Urru, Silvana Anna Maria; Solinas, Maria Giuliana; Franconi, Flavia; Floris, Matteo",Biomolecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34439872/; https://doi.org/10.3390/biom11081206,217

The Rho family GTPase Cdc42 is appreciated as a key moderator of cellular actin dynamics, and the development of specific Cdc42-inhibiting agents has given us an unprecedented ability to investigate its individual role in signalling pathways. However, investigative use of said agents, and the subsequent characterisation of the role Cdc42 plays in viral entry processes has been lacking. Here, we describe the current literature on the role of Cdc42 in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 cell entry, which represents the most investigated instance of Cdc42 function in viral cell entry processes, and also review evidence of Cdc42 use in other RNA virus cell entries, demonstrating prime areas for more extensive research using similar techniques.","Swaine, Thomas; Dittmar, Matthias T.",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v7122955; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26690467/,217

Strengths use is associated with positive outcomes for both the student (e.g., study engagement) and the university (e.g., academic throughput/performance). The Strengths Use Scale (SUS) has become a popular psychometric instrument to measure strengths use in educational settings, yet its use has been subjected to limited psychometric scrutiny outside of the U.S. Further, its longitudinal stability has not yet been established. Given the wide use of this instrument, the goals of this study were to investigate (a) longitudinal factorial validity and the internal consistency of the scale, (b) its equivalence over time, and (c) criterion validity through its relationship with study engagement over time. Data were gathered at two-time points, 3 months apart, from a sample of students in the Netherlands (n = 360). Longitudinal confirmatory factor analyses showed support for a two-factor model for overall strengths use, comprised of Affinity for Strengths and Strengths Use Behaviors. The SUS demonstrated high levels of internal consistency at both the lower- and upper bound limits at both time points. Further, strict longitudinal measurement invariance was established, which confirmed the instrument's temporal stability. Finally, criterion validity was established through relating strengths use to study engagement at different time stamps. These findings support the use of the SUS in practice to measure strengths use and to track the effectiveness of strengths use interventions within the higher education sector.","van Zyl, Llewellyn E.; Arijs, Diane; Cole, Matthew L.; Gliíska-Newes, Aldona; Roll, Lara C.; Rothmann, Sebastiaan; Shankland, Rebecca; Stavros, Jacqueline M.; Verger, Nicolas B.",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34211424/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.676153,217

This research investigated the recent threat of COVID-19 contagion, especially its impact among frontline paramedics treating patients with COVID-19, and their perception of self-infection, which ultimately increases their agonistic behaviour. Based on the stressor–strain–outcome paradigm, a research model was proposed and investigated using survey-based data through a structured questionnaire. The results found that the perceived threat of COVID-19 contagion (emotional and cognitive threat) was positively correlated with physiological anxiety, depression, and emotional exhaustion, which led toward agonistic behaviour. Further, perceived social support was a key moderator that negatively affected the relationships between agonistic behaviour and physiological anxiety, depression, and emotional exhaustion. These findings significantly contributed to the current literature concerning COVID-19 and pandemic-related effects on human behaviour. This study also theorized the concept of human agonistic behaviour, which has key implications for future researchers.","Shahzad, Fakhar; Du, Jianguo; Khan, Imran; Fateh, Adnan; Shahbaz, Muhammad; Abbas, Adnan; Wattoo, Muhammad Umair",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17145102; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32679748/,217

Children tend to develop less severe disease with a small percentage present with clinical manifestations of paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome and have poor prognosis. We studied the characteristics of COVID-19 in children requiring hospitalisation in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and assessed the clinical presentation and the risk factors for mortality, morbidity, and paediatric intensive care (PICU) admission. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of COVID-19 patients under 15 years hospitalised at three tertiary academic hospitals between 1 March and 30 June 2020. RESULTS: Eighty-eight children were enrolled (>20% were infants). Seven (8%) were in critical condition and required PICU admission, and 4 (4.5%) died of which 3 met the full diagnostic criteria of multi-system inflammatory syndrome and had a high Paediatric Risk of Mortality (PRISM) score at the time of admission. The initial polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test result was positive for COVID-19 in most patients (97.7%), and the remaining two patients had positive result in the repeated confirmatory test. In a subset of patients (20 subjects), repeated PCR testing was performed until conversion to negative result, and the average duration for conversion was 8 (95% CI: 5.2–10.5) days Children requiring PICU admission presented with signs of respiratory distress, dehydration, and heart failure. Most had fever (71.4%) and tonsillitis; 61.4% were discharged within 7 days of hospitalisation. Risk factors for mortality included skin rash, hypotension, hypoxia, signs of heart failure, chest radiograph suggestive of acute respiratory distress syndrome, anaemia, leucocytosis, hypernatraemia, abnormal liver enzymes, and high troponin I, and risk factors for prolonged hospitalisation (>7 days) included the presence of comorbidities, leucopaenia, hyponatraemia, and elevated C-reactive protein.

627488,Recommendations for Diagnosis and Treatment of Onychomycosis During the COVID‐19 Pandemic,2020-05-30,"BACKGROUND: Preterm birth is the leading cause of child mortality globally, with many survivors experiencing long-term adverse consequences. Preliminary evidence suggests that numbers of preterm births greatly reduced following implementation of policy measures aimed at mitigating the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to study the impact of the COVID-19 mitigation measures implemented in the Netherlands in a stepwise fashion on March 9, March 15, and March 23, 2020, on the incidence of preterm birth. METHODS: We used a national quasi-experimental difference-in-regression-discontinuity approach. We used data from the neonatal dried blood spot screening programme (2010–20) cross-validated against national perinatal registry data. Stratified analyses were done according to gestational age subgroups, and sensitivity analyses were done to assess robustness of the findings. We explored potential effect modification by neighbourhood socioeconomic status, sex, and small-for-gestational-age status. FINDINGS: Data on 1 599 547 singleton neonates were available, including 56 720 births that occurred after implementation of COVID-19 mitigation measures on March 9, 2020. Consistent reductions in the incidence of preterm birth were seen across various time windows surrounding March 9 (± 2 months [n=531 823] odds ratio [OR] 0·77, 95% CI 0·66–0·91, p=0·0026; ± 3 months [n=796 531] OR 0·85, 0·73–0·98, p=0·028; ± 4 months [n=1 066 872] OR 0·84, 0·73–0·97, p=0·023). Decreases in incidence observed following the March 15 measures were of smaller magnitude, but not statistically significant. No changes were observed after March 23. Reductions in the incidence of preterm births after March 9 were consistent across gestational age strata and robust in sensitivity analyses. They appeared confined to neighbourhoods of high socioeconomic status, but effect modification was not statistically significant. INTERPRETATION: In this national quasi-experimental study, initial implementation of COVID-19 mitigation measures was associated with a substantial reduction in the incidence of preterm births in the following months, in agreement with preliminary observations elsewhere. Integration of comparable data from across the globe is needed to further substantiate these findings and start exploring underlying mechanisms.

The aim of our study was to compare the number of acute appendicitis cases and the proportion of complicated appendicitis before and during the COVID 19 pandemic. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed all data collected from a multicenter database of patients presenting to the emergency department for acute appendicitis during the COVID-19 pandemic from March 12 to June 6, 2020, and compared these data with those from the same periods in 2017, 2018, and 2019. The number of acute appendicitis cases, proportion of complicated appendicitis, and pre and postoperative patient characteristics were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 306 patients were included in this evaluation. Sixtyfive patients presented during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic lockdown (group A), and 241 patients in previous years (group B: 2017 to 2019). The number of consultations for acute appendicitis decreased by almost 20 percent during the pandemic compared with previous periods, with a significant increase in complicated appendicitis (52% in group A versus 20% in group B, p < 0,001.). Comparing the two groups, significant differences were also noted in the duration of symptoms ( symptoms > 48h in 61% and 26% , p < 0,001), the intervention time ( 77 vs 61 minutes, p = 0,002), length of hospital stay ( hospitalization of > 2 days in 63% and 32%, p < 0.001) and duration of antibiotic treatment ( antibiotics > 3 days in 36% and 24% p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID 19 pandemic resulted in a decreased number of consultations for acute appendicitis, with a higher proportion of complicated appendicitis, most likely due to patient delay in consulting the emergency department at symptom onset. Patients and general practitioners should be aware of this problem to avoid a time delay from initial symptoms to consultation.","Burgard, M.; Cherbanyk, F.; Nassiopoulos, K.; Malekzadeh, S.; Pugin, F.; Egger, B.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.23.21250358v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.23.21250358,217

Recently, m6A has been proposed as an important factor driving hypoxia. Despite successful analyses, potential genes were not selected with statistical significance but were selected based solely on fold changes. Because the number of genes is large while the number of samples is small, it was impossible to select genes using conventional feature selection methods with statistical significance. In this study, we applied the recently proposed principal component analysis (PCA), tensor decomposition (TD), and kernel tensor decomposition (KTD)-based unsupervised feature extraction (FE) to a hypoxia data set. We found that PCA, TD, and KTD-based unsupervised FE could successfully identify a limited number of genes associated with altered gene expression and m6A profiles, as well as the enrichment of hypoxia-related biological terms, with improved statistical significance.","Roy, Sanjiban Sekhar; Taguchi, Y.-H.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33903618/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-87779-7,217

We aimed to isolate seasonal CoVs in Yamagata, Japan to obtain infective virions useful for further research and to accelerate fundamental studies on HCoVs and SARS-CoV-2. Using modified air-liquid interface (ALI) culture of the normal human airway epithelium from earlier studies, we isolated 29 HCoVs (80.6%: 16, 6, 6, and 1 isolates of HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E, respectively) from 36 cryopreserved nasopharyngeal specimens. In ALI cultures of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63, the harvested medium contained more than 1 × 104 genome copies/µL at every tested time point during the more than 100 days of culture. Four isolates of HCoV-NL63 were further subcultured and successfully propagated in an LLC-MK2 cell line. Our results suggest that ALI culture is useful for isolating seasonal CoVs and sustainably obtaining HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 virions. Furthermore, the LLC-MK2 cell line in combination with ALI cultures can be used for the large-scale culturing of HCoV-NL63.

This study aimed to investigate the anti‐hypoxic activities of dexamethasone to understand a possible mechanism of its action in hypoxia‐induced lethality through experimental models of hypoxia. METHODS: In this investigation, 84 Male BALB/c mice were randomly divided into groups of seven (12 groups). Treatment groups received 10 days of dexamethasone intraperitoneal injection at both human dose (~0.1 mg/kg) and the animal does (~1 mg/kg). Control negative and positive groups were treated with 10 ml/kg of normal saline and 30 mg/kg of propranolol, respectively. Three experimental models of hypoxia, asphyctic, circulatory, and hemic were applied in this study. RESULTS: The findings showed that dexamethasone significantly prolonged the latency for death in the asphyctic model concerning the control group in both humans (P < .0001) and animal dose (P < .0001). The results were also highly significant for both doses in the hemic model (P < .001). In the circulatory model, although a small increase was observed in death prolongation, results were not statistically significant for both doses in this model (P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: This experimental in vivo investigation demonstrated an excellent protective effect for 10 days of dexamethasone treatment against hypoxia, especially in asphyctic and hemic models. In addition to promising dexamethasone outcomes, using propranolol as the positive control illustrated a very substantial anti‐hypoxic effect even much better than dexamethasone in all models. It seems that propranolol would be a safe, potential, and prudent choice to invest in treating COVID‐19 patients.","Hosseinzadeh, Mohammad Hossein; Shamshirian, Amir; Ebrahimzadeh, Mohammad Ali",Int J Clin Pract,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.13943; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33332726/,217

The recent global pandemic is a natural experiment for exploring the role of government interventions and their direct impact on hospitality stock returns in the U.S. financial market. Overall, our findings show that most of the government interventions were associated with a negative response in the returns of the hospitality industry, a response that became more negative as the COVID-19 pandemic evolved. Similar patterns were also detected for other industries such as entertainment and transportation that are closely related to hospitality. The findings we document are fundamental to understanding the trends and fluctuations in hospitality stocks in the current crisis and any similar crisis in the future.","Aharon, David Yechiam; Jacobi, Arie; Cohen, Eli; Tzur, Joseph; Qadan, Mahmoud",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34358283/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255819,217

While the best option in terms of non-invasive systems of oxygen delivery is still a matter of debate, it also remains unclear as to whether or not the optimal in-bed positioning of patients might also help to improve their oxygen saturation levels. On the basis of three representative cases, it is possible to propose the following hypotheses: (i) how patients are positioned has a strong influence on their oxygen saturation levels; (ii) saturation-optimalized positions are patient-specific; (iii) prone positions require ergonomic devices; and (iv) saturation-optimalized positions should aim to place the most affected part(s) of the lung(s) on top. Considered together, these hypotheses have led us to recommend that COVID-19 patients should undergo a specific assessment at admission to determine their saturation-optimalized in-bed position. However, further studies are still needed to assess the benefits of such a strategy on clinical outcomes.","Froelich, Sébastien; Mandonnet, Emmanuel; Julla, Jean-Baptiste; Touchard, Cyril; Laloi-Michelin, Marie; Kevorkian, Jean-Philippe; Gautier, Jean-François",Diabetes Metab,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diabet.2020.05.009; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1262363620300860; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1262363620300860?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32473964/,217

Using examples from different countries (principally the United Kingdom, the United States, and France), we first isolate three factors which determine whether people accept or reject control measures. These are the historical context of state‐public relations, the nature of leadership during the pandemic and procedural justice in the development and operation of these measures. Second, we analyse the way the crisis is policed and how forms of policing determine whether dissent will escalate into open conflict.

On the other hand, there is a growing demand by industry for plants used in traditional medicine that could be incorporated in foods, nutraceuticals, cosmetics, or even pharmaceuticals. Glycyrrhiza glabra Linn. belongs to the Fabaceae family and has been recognized since ancient times for its ethnopharmacological values. This plant contains different phytocompounds, such as glycyrrhizin, 18β‐glycyrrhetinic acid, glabrin A and B, and isoflavones, that have demonstrated various pharmacological activities. Pharmacological experiments have demonstrated that different extracts and pure compounds from this species exhibit a broad range of biological properties, including antibacterial, anti‐inflammatory, antiviral, antioxidant, and antidiabetic activities. A few toxicological studies have reported some concerns. This review addresses all those issues and focuses on the pharmacological activities reported for G. glabra. Therefore, an updated, critical, and extensive overview on the current knowledge of G. glabra composition and biological activities is provided here in order to explore its therapeutic potential and future challenges to be utilized for the formulation of new products that will contribute to human well‐being.","Pastorino, Giulia; Cornara, Laura; Soares, Sónia; Rodrigues, Francisca; Oliveira, M.

It occurs in 5% of patients treated with unfractionated heparin and 0.5 - 1.5% fractionated heparin. The aim of the study is to determine the incidence and outcome of hemodialysis patients with HIT over 4-years period. METHOD: This retrospective study analyzed patients who were tested for evidence of positive anti-heparin antibody in the period from 2015 to 2020 in Zvezdara University Medical Center. The diagnosis was confirmed by the 4T clinical scoring system, a positive antiheparin-PF4 ELISA test and a positive platelet aggregation test with heparin. RESULTS: During observation period, total of 64 tests were performed, out of which 23 patients were positive. Out of them, 14 patients were on HD, 7 patients (geriatric, surgery and cardiology departments) received therapy due to peripheral thrombosis, AIM or arrhythmia and 2 patients during 2020 due to SARS-CoV-2 bilateral pneumonia. All patients treated at nephrology, started hemodialysis (HD) with unfractionated heparin, while others were treated with LMWH. 4T scoring showed that 64% of patients had a moderate risk of developing HIT, while high risk was assessed in 36% of patients. Thrombotic complications in the form of deep venous thrombosis had 53% of patients and pulmonary thromboembolism had 17,5 % of patients. The greatest decrease in Tr was the most commonly observed between 10(th) and 14(th) day (61% of patients) and 39% from 4(th) to 10(th) day from start of heparin administration. In addition to heparin withdrawal and treatment with alternative non-heparin anticoagulation (fondaparinoux), 7 patients needed plasma treatment. 11 patients on HD were transferred to peritoneal dialysis (PD), and 3 patients recovered renal function. Overall mortality was 52%, and it was below 30% in hemodialysis patients. CONCLUSION: HIT should be considered in patients at risk. It is necessary to abolish heparin treatment and use alternative method (PD) or alternative anticoagulation.

635961,The way in which COVID-19 changed behaviour on social media in Malta,2020-11-12,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), a member of the Arteriviridae family, is one of the most common and economically important swine pathogens. Although both live-attenuated and killed-inactivated vaccines against the virus have been available for a decade, PRRSV is still a major problem in the swine industry worldwide. To explore the possibility of producing single-round infectious PRRSV replicon particles as a potential vaccine strategy, we have now generated two necessary components: 1) a stable cell line (BHK/Sinrepl9/PRRSV-N) that constitutively expresses the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein localized to the cytoplasm and the nucleolus and 2) a PRRSV replicon vector (pBAC/PRRSV/Replicon-AN) with a 177-nucleotide deletion, removing the 3′-half portion of ORF7 in the viral genome, from which the self-replicating propagation-defective replicon RNAs were synthesized in vitro by SP6 polymerase run-off transcription. Transfection of this replicon RNA into N protein-expressing BHK-21 cells led to the secretion of infectious particles that packaged the replicon RNA, albeit with a low production efficiency of 0.4 × 10(2) to 1.1 × 10(2) infectious units/ml; the produced particles had only single-round infectivity with no cell-to-cell spread. This trans-complementation system for PRRSV provides a useful platform for studies to define the packaging signals and motifs present within the viral genome and N protein, respectively, and to develop viral replicon-based antiviral vaccines that will stop the infection and spread of this pathogen.","Song, Byung-Hak; Kim, Jeong-Min; Kim, Jin-Kyoung; Jang, Han-Saem; Yun, Gil-Nam; Choi, Eun-Jin; Song, Jae-Young; Yun, Sang-Im; Lee, Young-Min",J Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12275-011-1280-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21717343/,217

Here we explored the antibody epitope repertoire, antibody binding and virus neutralizing capacity of six hCoV-2IG batches as well as nine convalescent plasma (CP) lots against SARS-CoV-2 and emerging variants of concern (VOC). The Gene-Fragment Phage display library spanning the SARS-CoV-2 spike demonstrated broad recognition of multiple antigenic sites spanning the entire spike including NTD, RBD, S1/S2 cleavage site, S2-fusion peptide and S2-heptad repeat regions. Antibody binding to the immunodominant epitopes was higher for hCoV-2IG than CP, with predominant binding to the fusion peptide. In the pseudovirus neutralization assay (PsVNA) and in the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 PRNT assay, hCoV-2IG lots showed higher titers against the WA-1 strain compared with CP. Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs from around the globe were reduced to different levels by hCoV-2IG lots. The most significant loss of neutralizing activity was seen against the B.1.351 (9-fold) followed by P.1 (3.5-fold), with minimal loss of activity against the B.1.17 and B.1.429 (≤2-fold). Again, the CP showed more pronounced loss of cross-neutralization against the VOCs compared with hCoV-2IG. Significant reduction of hCoV-2IG binding was observed to the RBD-E484K followed by RBD-N501Y and minimal loss of binding to RBD-K417N compared with unmutated RBD. This study suggests that post-exposure treatment with hCoV-2IG is preferable to CP. In countries with co-circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants, identifying the infecting virus strain could inform optimal treatments, but would likely require administration of higher volumes or repeated infusions of hCOV-2IG or CP, in patients infected with the emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.","Tang, Juanjie; Lee, Youri; Ravichandran, Supriya; Grubbs, Gabrielle; Huang, Chang; Stauft, Charles; Wang, Tony; Golding, Basil; Golding, Hana; Khurana, Surender",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.19.436183,217

A Critical Reflection on the Findings of the Survey Examining Chaplaincy Responses to Covid-19,2021-03-17,"Social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic has driven some consumers to online shopping, and concerns about pandemic risks and personal hygiene have increased the demand for e-commerce. Providing personalized recommendations seems quite profitable for e-commerce platforms, and consumers also benefit from personalized content with the advancement of AI technologies. However, this possible win-win situation is marred by the increase in consumers' privacy concerns. Technical solutions have been widely studied to protect consumer privacy, while few analyses have been conducted from the perspective of psychological and behavioral implications. In this paper, an evolutionary game model of privacy protection between e-commerce platforms and consumers is established to determine the mechanisms by which various factors exert influence, and evolutionary stable strategies are obtained from equilibrium points. Then, the strategy selections are simulated with MATLAB 2020 software. Based on the results, the following conclusions are drawn: (1) the application of AI technologies in e-commerce will fundamentally benefit consumers, which makes them actively share personal information with e-commerce platforms with incentives for generous rewards; (2) it is profitable for e-commerce platforms to conduct data mining by improving the ability to use AI technologies and making efforts to reduce technical costs; and (3) regulators should improve the level of supervision instead of imposing a large penalty to enhance consumer trust, which could effectively increase the profits of e-commerce platforms and protect consumers' privacy.","Wang, Su; Chen, Zhuo; Xiao, Yi; Lin, Chunyu",Front Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.705777; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34307290/,217

RESULTS Out of 1348 members, 225 (16.7%) responded. Most were female (59.8%; 113/189). Median age was 47 (interquartile range [IQR] 37-57) (N = 154). The majority were MD/DOs (83.7%; 159/190) or NP/PAs (14.7%; 28/190), and most (65.1%; 123/189) were in academia. Years in practice were 0-3: 28; 4-10: 58; 11-20: 42; 20+: 61. Median number of telehealth visits was 120 (IQR 77.5-250) in the prior 3 months. Respondents were ""comfortable/very comfortable"" treating via telehealth (a) new patient with a chief complaint of headache (median, IQR 4 [3-5]); (b) follow-up for migraine (median, IQR 5 [5-5]); (c) follow-up for secondary headache (median, IQR 4 [3-4]). About half (51.1%; 97/190) offer urgent telehealth. Beyond being unable to perform procedures, top barriers were conducting parts of the neurologic exam (157/189), absence of vital signs (117/189), and socioeconomic/technologic barriers (91/189). Top positive attributes were patient convenience (185/190), reducing patient travel stress (172/190), patient cost reduction (151/190), flexibility with personal matters (128/190), patient comfort at home (114/190), and patient medications nearby (103/190).

Methods We collected 637 nasopharyngeal swab samples from 274 individuals. Samples were subjected to quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) as well as the Roche and Lumipulse Ag tests. Results When RT-qPCR was used as a reference, the overall concordance rate of the Roche Ag test was 77.1% (491/637) with 70.0% (341/487) sensitivity and 100% specificity (150/150);. When inconclusive results of the Lumipulse Ag test were excluded, the overall concordance rate of Lumipulse Ag test was 88.3% (467/529) with 84.8% (330/389) sensitivity and 97.9% (137/140) specificity.

But the question about the immune mechanism of patients with COVID-19 is unclear and cause particular concern to the world. Here, we launched a follow-up analysis of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 of 192 COVID-19 patients, aiming to depict a kinetics profile of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and explore the related factors of antibodies expression against SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patient. Methods: A total of 192 COVID-19 patients enrolled in the designated hospital of Guangzhou , Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital, from January to February 2020 were selected as the study cohort. A cohort of 130 COVID-19 suspects who had been excluded from SARS-CoV-2 infected by negative RT-PCR result and 209 healthy people were enrolled in this study. Detection of IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 were performed by Chemiluminescence immunoassay in different groups . Results: It has been found that the seroconversion time of IgM against SARS-CoV-2 in most patients was 5-10 days after the symptoms onset , and then rose rapidly, reaching a peak around 2 to 3 weeks, and the median peak concentration was 2.705 AU / mL. The peak of IgM maintained within one week, and then enters the descending channel. IgG seroconverted later than or synchronously with IgM, reaching peaks around 3 to 4 weeks.The median peak concentration was 33.998AU / ml,which was higher than that of IgM . IgM titers begins to gradually decrease after reaching the peak in the 4th week, after the 8th week, a majority of IgM in patient's serum started to turn negative. On the contrary, titers of IgG began to decline slightly after the fifth week, and more than 90% of results of patients were positive after 8 weeks. Additionally, the concentration of antibodies positively correlated with the severity of the disease and the duration of virus exist in host. Conclusion: We depict a kinetics profile of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients and found out that the levels of antibodies were related to the disease severity,age, gender and virus clearance or continuous proliferation of COVID-19 patients.","Ou, J.; Tan, M.; He, H.; Tan, H.; Mai, J.; Long, Y.; Jiang, X.; He, Q.; Huang, Y.; Li, Y.; Chen, R.; Li, L.; Li, F.; Shi, Y.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.22.20102525v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.22.20102525,217

Methods: Posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples were collected without restriction on timing or alimentation by general practitioners from patients with acute respiratory infection (ARI) seen in consultation. Saliva samples were tested by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 and 21 other respiratory pathogens. Results for SARS-CoV-2 in saliva samples were compared to results obtained using a nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) collected in a certified medical laboratory before or after the ARI consultation. Results: Overall, 143 ARI patients were enrolled between 6 June 2020, and 19 January 2021. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 37.0% (n = 53) of saliva samples and in 39.0% (n = 56) of NPS. Both saliva and NPS were positive in 51 patients. Positive and negative results were concordant between saliva samples and NPS in 51 (96.2%) and in 85 (94.4%) patients, respectively, with a Cohen’s Kappa coefficient of 0.89 (95% CI 0.82–0.97, p < 0.001). Other respiratory viruses were detected in 28.0% (n = 40) of the 143 saliva samples. Conclusions: Findings suggest that saliva samples could represent an attractive alternative to NPS for surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in patients consulting for an ARI in primary care.","Masse, Shirley; Bonnet, Camille; Vilcu, Ana-Maria; Benamar, Hayat; Swital, Morgane; Sylvie, van der Werf; Carrat, Fabrice; Hanslik, Thomas; Blanchon, Thierry; Falchi, Alessandra",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v13050761; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33926069/,217

Enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) have been shown to detect anti‐PF4 in patients with VITT, but chemiluminesence assays do not reliably detect them. ELISA assays are not widely available in diagnostic laboratories, and, globally, very few laboratories perform platelet activation assays. Assays which are commercially available in the United Kingdom were evaluated for their ability to identify anti‐PF4 antibodies in samples from patients with suspected VITT. Four IgG‐specific ELISAs, two polyspecific ELISAs and four rapid assays were performed on samples from 43 patients with suspected VITT from across the UK. Cases were identified after referral to the UK Expert Haematology Panel multi‐disciplinary team and categorised into unlikely, possible or probable VITT. We demonstrated that the HemosIL AcuStar HIT‐IgG, HemosIL HIT‐Ab, Diamed PaGIA gel and STic Expert assays have poor sensitivity for VITT in comparison to ELISA. Where these assays are used for heparin induced thrombocytopenia diagnosis, laboratories should ensure that requests for suspected VITT are clearly identified so that an ELISA is performed. No superiority of IgG‐ELISAs over polyspecific‐ELISAs in sensitivity to VITT could be demonstrated. No single ELISA method detected all possible/probable VITT cases; if a single ELISA test is negative, a second ELISA or a platelet activation assay should be considered where there is strong clinical suspicion.","Platton, Sean; Bartlett, Andrew; MacCallum, Peter; Makris, Mike; McDonald, Vickie; Singh, Deepak; Scully, Marie; Pavord, Sue",J Thromb Haemost,https://doi.org/10.1111/jth.15362; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33973336/,217

This current study analyzes the trends in COVID-19 testing, and COVID-19 antigen and antibody positivity rates over a 3-month time-span from October to December 2020. A retrospective study was conducted collecting data from a mobile testing program during October to December 2020 in the Phoenix metropolitan area. COVID-19 antigen and antibody positivity rates were analyzed. A total of 6710 patients were included in the study. As the months progressed, more patients were tested (October: 1635; November: 2037; December: 3038). The COVID-19 antigen positivity rate was significantly higher in December, compared to October and November (13.43% vs. 11.43 and 10.86%, p = 0.021). COVID-19 IgG rates were also significantly higher in November and December, compared to October (16.65 and 16.50% vs. 8.74%, p < 0.001). There was a progressive increase in COVID-19 positivity cases towards the end of 2020, likely attributed to factors including social gatherings during the holidays and the relaxing of the closure restrictions.

The pandemic has tested the robustness of comprehensive stroke care programs. Especially during the months of confinement, an alarming increase in the incidence of several risk factors for cerebrovascular diseases was noticed, without, however, the proportional strengthening of strategies for the prevention and/or control of comorbidities. Patients who had already suffered a stroke were neglected from the secondary prevention routine and neurological rehabilitation therapies. Regarding the acute treatment, the fear of contagion in the hospital environment promoted a significant delay in the time from the onset of symptoms to admission to an emergency department as well as in the door to imaging and door to needle times. Moreover, the pandemic also exposed the enormous inequalities in the approach to cerebrovascular diseases worldwide. Actually, many consequences of COVID-19 in stroke care will persist for months even after pandemic control. Strategies to combat the pandemic must be reconciled with the fight against stroke in a way that does not exclude any patient from access to the best possible care.","Vitturi, Bruno Kusznir",SN Compr Clin Med,https://doi.org/10.1007/s42399-021-00936-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33969270/,217
640660,Retrospective study in clinical governance and financing system impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in the hand surgery and microsurgery HUB center,2021-02-02,"SARS-CoV-2 infection outbreaks in minks have serious implications associated with animal health and welfare, and public health. In two naturally infected mink farms (A and B) located in Greece, we investigated the outbreaks and assessed parameters associated with virus transmission, immunity, pathology, and environmental contamination. Symptoms ranged from anorexia and mild depression to respiratory signs of varying intensity. Although the farms were at different breeding stages, mortality was similarly high (8.4% and 10.0%). The viral strains belonged to lineages B.1.1.218 and B.1.1.305, possessing the mink-specific S-Y453F substitution. Lung histopathology identified necrosis of smooth muscle and connective tissue elements of vascular walls, and vasculitis as the main early key events of the acute SARS-CoV-2-induced broncho-interstitial pneumonia. Molecular investigation in two dead minks indicated a consistently higher (0.3–1.3 log(10) RNA copies/g) viral load in organs of the male mink compared to the female. In farm A, the infected farmers were responsible for the significant initial infection of 229 out of 1,000 handled minks, suggesting a very efficient human-to-mink transmission. Subsequent infections across the sheds wherein animals were being housed occurred due to airborne transmission. Based on a R(0) of 2.90 and a growth rate equal to 0.293, the generation time was estimated to be 3.6 days, indicative of the massive SARS-CoV-2 dispersal among minks. After the end of the outbreaks, a similar percentage of animals were immune in the two farms (93.0% and 93.3%), preventing further virus transmission whereas, viral RNA was detected in samples collected from shed surfaces and air. Consequently, strict biosecurity is imperative during the occurrence of clinical signs. Environmental viral load monitoring, in conjunction with NGS should be adopted in mink farm surveillance. The minimum proportion of minks that need to be immunized to avoid outbreaks in farms was calculated at 65.5%, which is important for future vaccination campaigns.","Chaintoutis, Serafeim C.; Thomou, Zoi; Mouchtaropoulou, Evangelia; Tsiolas, George; Chassalevris, Taxiarchis; Stylianaki, Ioanna; Lagou, Maria; Michailidou, Sofia; Moutou, Evangelia; Koenen, Jacobus Johannes Hendrik; Dijkshoorn, Jacoba Wilhelmina; Paraskevis, Dimitrios; Poutahidis, Theofilos; Siarkou, Victoria I.; Sypsa, Vana; Argiriou, Anagnostis; Fortomaris, Paschalis; Dovas, Chrysostomos I.",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34492088/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1009883,217

From a pathophysiological perspective, COVID-19 is characterized by an overproduction of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-alpha), causing systemic inflammation and hypercoagulability, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Emerging data postulate that CKD under conservative treatment or renal replacement therapy (RRT) is an important risk factor for disease severity and higher in-hospital mortality amongst patients with COVID-19. Regarding RAAS blockers therapy during the pandemic, the initial assumption of a potential increase and deleterious impact in infectivity, disease severity, and mortality was not evidenced in medical literature. Moreover, the challenge of implementing social distancing in patients requiring dialysis during the pandemic prompted national and international societies to publish recommendations regarding the adoption of safety measures to reduce transmission risk and optimize dialysis treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic. Current data convey that kidney transplant recipients are more vulnerable to more severe infection. Thus, we provide a comprehensive review of the clinical outcomes and prognosis of patients with CKD under conservative treatment and dialysis, and kidney transplant recipients and COVID-19 infection.","Pecly, Inah Maria D.; Azevedo, Rafael B.; Muxfeldt, Elizabeth S.; Botelho, Bruna G.; Albuquerque, Gabriela G.; Diniz, Pedro Henrique P.; Silva, Rodrigo; Rodrigues, Cibele I.

In tissue culture, PTC299 manifests robust, dose-dependent, and DHODH-dependent inhibition of SARS CoV-2 replication (EC50 range, 2.0 to 31.6 nM) with a selectivity index >3,800. PTC299 also blocked replication of other RNA viruses, including Ebola virus. Consistent with known DHODH requirements for immunomodulatory cytokine production, PTC299 inhibited the production of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-17A (also called IL-17), IL-17F, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in tissue culture models.

642942,Insights into the association of ACEIs/ARBs use and COVID-19 prognosis: a multistate modelling study of nationwide hospital surveillance data from Belgium,2021-09-16,"BACKGROUND: As of July 17, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected over 14 million people worldwide, with over 3.68 million cases in the United States. As the number of COVID-19 cases increased in Massachusetts, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health mandated that all health care workers be screened for symptoms daily prior to entering any hospital or health care facility. We rapidly created a digital COVID-19 symptom screening tool to enable this screening for a large, academic, integrated health care delivery system, Partners HealthCare, in Boston, Massachusetts. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to describe the design and development of the COVID Pass COVID-19 symptom screening application and report aggregate usage data from the first three months of its use across the organization. METHODS: Using agile principles, we designed, tested, and implemented a solution over the span of one week using progressively customized development approaches as the requirements and use case become more solidified. We developed the minimum viable product (MVP) of a mobile-responsive, web-based, self-service application using research electronic data capture (REDCap). For employees without access to a computer or mobile device to use the self-service application, we established a manual process where in-person, socially distanced screeners asked employees entering the site if they have symptoms and then manually recorded the responses in an Office 365 Form. A custom .NET Framework application solution was developed as COVID Pass was scaled. We collected log data from the .NET application, REDCap, and Microsoft Office 365 from the first three months of enterprise deployment (March 30 to June 30, 2020). Aggregate descriptive statistics, including overall employee attestations by day and site, employee attestations by application method (COVID Pass automatic screening vs manual screening), employee attestations by time of day, and percentage of employees reporting COVID-19 symptoms, were obtained. RESULTS: We rapidly created the MVP and gradually deployed it across the hospitals in our organization. By the end of the first week, the screening application was being used by over 25,000 employees each weekday. After three months, 2,169,406 attestations were recorded with COVID Pass. Over this period, 1865/160,159 employees (1.2%) reported positive symptoms. 1,976,379 of the 2,169,406 attestations (91.1%) were generated from the self-service screening application. The remainder were generated either from manual attestation processes (174,865/2,169,406, 8.1%) or COVID Pass kiosks (25,133/2,169,406, 1.2%). Hospital staff continued to work 24 hours per day, with staff attestations peaking around shift changes between 7 and 8 AM, 2 and 3 PM, 4 and 6 PM, and 11 PM and midnight. CONCLUSIONS: Using rapid, agile development, we quickly created and deployed a dedicated employee attestation application that gained widespread adoption and use within our health system. Further, we identified 1865 symptomatic employees who otherwise may have come to work, potentially putting others at risk. We share the story of our implementation, lessons learned, and source code (via GitHub) for other institutions who may want to implement similar solutions.","Zhang, Haipeng; Dimitrov, Dimitar; Simpson, Lynn; Plaks, Nina; Singh, Balaji; Penney, Stephen; Charles, Jo; Sheehan, Rosemary; Flammini, Steven; Murphy, Shawn; Landman, Adam",JMIR Form Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32877348/; https://doi.org/10.2196/19533,217

Bats in the order Chiroptera are widely distributed worldwide and are natural reservoirs of prominent zoonotic viruses, including Nipah virus, Marburg virus, and possibly SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we applied unbiased metagenomic and metatranscriptomic approaches to decipher the virosphere of frugivorous and insectivorous bat species captured in Guéckédou, Guinea, the epicenter of the West African Ebola virus disease epidemic in 2013–2016. Our study provides a snapshot of the viral diversity present in these bat species, with several novel viruses reported for the first time in bats, as well as some bat viruses closely related to known human or animal pathogens. In addition, analysis of Mops condylurus genomic DNA samples revealed the presence of an Ebola virus nucleoprotein (NP)-derived pseudogene inserted in its genome. These findings provide insight into the evolutionary traits of several virus families in bats and add evidence that nonretroviral integrated RNA viruses (NIRVs) derived from filoviruses may be common in bat genomes.","Hermida Lorenzo, Roberto J.; Cadar, Dániel; Koundouno, Fara Raymond; Juste, Javier; Bialonski, Alexandra; Baum, Heike; García-Mudarra, Juan Luis; Hakamaki, Henry; Bencsik, András; Nelson, Emily V.; Carroll, Miles W.; Magassouba, N’Faly; Günther, Stephan; Schmidt-Chanasit, Jonas; Muñoz Fontela, César; Escudero-Pérez, Beatriz",Microorganisms,https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms9030599; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33803988/,217
643594,Emerging COVID‐19‐related deaths during home recuperation in Japan,2021-02-23,"In the United States, schools closed in March 2020 due to COVID-19 and began reopening in August 2020, despite continuing transmission of SARS-CoV-2. In states where in-person instruction resumed at that time, two major unknowns were the capacity at which schools would operate, which depended on the proportion of families opting for remote instruction, and adherence to face-mask requirements in schools, which depended on cooperation from students and enforcement by schools. To determine the impact of these conditions on the statewide burden of COVID-19 in Indiana, we used an agent-based model calibrated to and validated against multiple data types. Using this model, we quantified the burden of COVID-19 on K-12 students, teachers, their families, and the general population under alternative scenarios spanning three levels of school operating capacity (50 %, 75 %, and 100 %) and three levels of face-mask adherence in schools (50 %, 75 %, and 100 %). Under a scenario in which schools operated remotely, we projected 45,579 (95 % CrI: 14,109–132,546) infections and 790 (95 % CrI: 176–1680) deaths statewide between August 24 and December 31. Reopening at 100 % capacity with 50 % face-mask adherence in schools resulted in a proportional increase of 42.9 (95 % CrI: 41.3–44.3) and 9.2 (95 % CrI: 8.9–9.5) times that number of infections and deaths, respectively. In contrast, our results showed that at 50 % capacity with 100 % face-mask adherence, the number of infections and deaths were 22 % (95 % CrI: 16 %–28 %) and 11 % (95 % CrI: 5 %–18 %) higher than the scenario in which schools operated remotely. Within this range of possibilities, we found that high levels of school operating capacity (80–95 %) and intermediate levels of face-mask adherence (40–70 %) resulted in model behavior most consistent with observed data. Together, these results underscore the importance of precautions taken in schools for the benefit of their communities.","España, Guido; Cavany, Sean; Oidtman, Rachel; Barbera, Carly; Costello, Alan; Lerch, Anita; Poterek, Marya; Tran, Quan; Wieler, Annaliese; Moore, Sean; Perkins, T.

Although countries have made varied efforts, the pestilence is escalating due to the high infectivity. It is highly likely that dental professionals in upcoming days will come across COVID-19 patients and SARS-CoV-2 carriers, and hence must ensure a tactful handling of such patients to prevent its nosocomial spread. Despite the avalanche of information that has exploded in relation to this rapidly spreading disease, there is a lack of consolidated information to guide dentists regarding clinical management including precautions to take materials to use and postprocedure care, during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Available sources of information have been analyzed, while relying on peer-reviewed reports followed by information available from the most respected authoritative sources, such as WHO, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and ADA. This review aims to provide a comprehensive summary from the available literature on COVID-19, its insinuation in dentistry, recommendations that have been published, and the actual in-practice implications, so a plan can be formulated and adapted to the circumstances of each dental practice during the pandemic and the times to follow.

This situation underlines the urgent need for novel antivirals as well as innovations in vaccine production in preparation for the next influenza epidemic. Here we report the development of a cell-based high-throughput screen which we have used for the identification of compounds that modulate influenza virus growth either negatively or positively. We screened a library of compounds with known biological activity and identified distinct groups of inhibitors and enhancers that target sodium channels or protein kinase C (PKC). We confirmed these results in viral growth assays and find that treatment with a sodium channel opener or PKC inhibitor significantly reduces viral replication. In contrast, inhibition of sodium channels or activation of PKC leads to enhanced virus production in tissue culture. These diametrically opposing effects strongly support a role for PKC activity and the regulation of Na(+) currents in influenza virus replication and both may serve as targets for antiviral drugs.

Some of these viruses have the potential for rapid and global spread with high morbidity and mortality, such as the SARS coronavirus outbreak. It is extremely urgent and important to identify a novel virus near-instantaneously to develop an active preventive and/or control strategy. As a culture-independent approach, viral metagenomics has been widely used to investigate highly divergent and completely new viruses in humans, animals, and even environmental samples in the past decade. A new model of Koch’s postulates, named the metagenomic Koch’s postulates, has provided guidance for the study of the pathogenicity of novel viruses. This review explains the viral metagenomics strategy for virus discovery and describes viruses discovered in human feces in the past 10 years using this approach. This review also addresses issues related to the metagenomic Koch’s postulates and the challenges for virus discovery in the future.","Xie, GuangCheng; Yu, JieMei; Duan, ZhaoJun",Sci China Life Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23917840/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11427-013-4516-y,217

METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we included all consecutive patients who presented to the ER between March 13 and 23 for suspected COVID-19 and underwent CT and RT-PCR within 3 days. Using a structured report, radiologists prospectively classified CTs in highly suggestive, suggestive, and non-suggestive of COVID-19 pneumonia. Ground-glass, consolidation, and visual extension of parenchymal changes were collected. Three different RT-PCR-based reference standard definitions were used. Oxygen saturation level, CRP, LDH, and blood cell counts were collected and compared between CT/RT-PCR classes. RESULTS: The study included 696 patients (41.4% women; age 59 ± 15.8 years): 423/454 (93%) patients with highly suggestive CT, 97/127 (76%) with suggestive CT, and 31/115 (27%) with non-suggestive CT had positive RT-PCR. CT sensitivity ranged from 73 to 77% and from 90 to 94% for high and low positivity threshold, respectively. Specificity ranged from 79 to 84% for high positivity threshold and was about 58% for low positivity threshold. PPV remained ≥ 90% in all cases. Ground-glass was more frequent in patients with positive RT-PCR in all CT classes. Blood tests were significantly associated with RT-PCR and CT classes. Leukocytes, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and platelets decreased, CRP and LDH increased from non-suggestive to suggestive CT classes. CONCLUSIONS: During the outbreak peak (in a high-prevalence setting), CT presented high PPV and may be considered a good reference to recognize COVID-19 patients while waiting for RT-PCR confirmation. KEY POINTS: • During the epidemic peak, CT showed high positive predictive value and sensitivity for COVID-19 pneumonia when compared with RT-PCR. • Blood tests were significantly associated with RT-PCR and CT classes.

This study investigates the implications of outsourcing on healthcare supply chains by comparing two alternatives: outsourcing from public-to-private and outsourcing from public-to-public. A conceptual framework, adapted from previous literature, has been employed to provide a comprehensive overview of the phenomenon and consider the implications of logistics and procurement outsourcing on the healthcare supply chain structure and performance. The study presents a European cross-country comparison, analysing both the National Health Service (NHS) outsourcing in England (public-to-private outsourcing) and the Regional Health Service (RHS) outsourcing in the Tuscany region (Italy) (public-to-public outsourcing). Specificities and commonalities of the two outsourcing experiences provide suggestions for managers and policy-makers and enhance the current knowledge of outsourcing in the public healthcare sector.","Skipworth, Heather; Delbufalo, Emanuela; Mena, Carlos",,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0263237320300542?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0263237320300542,217

A Longitudinal Study,2021-08-31,"Background Cardiac injury and myocarditis have been described in adults with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in children is typically minimally symptomatic. We report a series of febrile pediatric patients with acute heart failure potentially associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children as defined by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Methods Over a 2-month period, contemporary with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in France and Switzerland, we retrospectively collected clinical, biological, therapeutic, and early outcomes data in children who were admitted to pediatric intensive care units in 14 centers for cardiogenic shock, left ventricular dysfunction, and severe inflammatory state. Results Thirty-five children were identified and included in the study. Median age at admission was 10 years (range, 2–16 years). Comorbidities were present in 28%, including asthma and overweight. Gastrointestinal symptoms were prominent. Left ventricular ejection fraction was <30% in one-third; 80% required inotropic support with 28% treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Inflammation markers were suggestive of cytokine storm (interleukin-6 median, 135pg/mL) and macrophage activation (D-dimer median, 5284ng/mL). Mean BNP (B-type natriuretic peptide) was elevated (5743pg/mL). Thirty-one of 35 patients (88%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by polymerase chain reaction of nasopharyngeal swab or serology. All patients received intravenous immunoglobulin, with adjunctive steroid therapy used in one-third. Left ventricular function was restored in the 25 of 35 of those discharged from the intensive care unit. No patient died, and all patients treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation were successfully weaned. Conclusions Children may experience an acute cardiac decompensation caused by severe inflammatory state after SARS-CoV-2 infection (multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children). Treatment with immunoglobulin appears to be associated with recovery of left ventricular systolic function.","Belhadjer, Zahra; Méot, Mathilde; Bajolle, Fanny; Khraiche, Diala; Legendre, Antoine; Abakka, Samya; Auriau, Johanne; Grimaud, Marion; Oualha, Mehdi; Beghetti, Maurice; Wacker, Julie; Ovaert, Caroline; Hascoet, Sebastien; Selegny, Maëlle; Malekzadeh-Milani, Sophie; Maltret, Alice; Bosser, Gilles; Giroux, Nathan; Bonnemains, Laurent; Bordet, Jeanne; Di Filippo, Sylvie; Mauran, Pierre; Falcon-Eicher, Sylvie; Thambo, Jean-Benoît; Lefort, Bruno; Moceri, Pamela; Houyel, Lucile; Renolleau, Sylvain; Bonnet, Damien",Archives of Cardiovascular Diseases Supplements,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acvdsp.2021.06.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1878648021002482; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878648021002482,217

Patients and Methods: After IRB approval, we reviewed the charts of 107 patients seen between January 19, 2021 and April 29, 2021 in the Mayo Clinic Post COVID Care Clinic (PCOCC) in order to describe the first 107 patients treated through the Mayo Clinic PCOCC. Data was abstracted from the electronic medical record into a standardized database to facilitate analysis. Phenotypes of patients seen in the PCOCC clinic were identified by expert review of predominant symptom clusters. Results: The majority of patients seen in our clinic were female (75%, 80/107), and the median age at presentation was 47 years (interquartile range [IQR] 37, 55). All had Post Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) with six clinical phenotypes being identified: fatigue predominant (n=68), dyspnea predominant (n=23), myalgia predominant (n=6), orthostasis predominant (n=6), chest pain predominant (n=3), and headache predominant (n=1). The fatigue-predominant phenotype was more common in women (84%, p=0.006) and the dyspnea-predominant phenotype was more common in men (52%, p=0.002). IL-6 was elevated in 61% of patients (69% of women, p=0.0046) which was statistically discordant with elevation in CRP and ESR which was identified in 17% and 20% of cases respectively (p<0.001). Four PASC phenotypes (fatigue-predominant, myalgia-predominant, orthostasis predominant, and headache-predominant) were associated with central sensitization (CS), and higher IL-6 levels than those phenotypes not associated with CS (p=0.013). Patients with CS phenotypes after COVID-19 infection (post COVID syndrome) were predominantly female (80%, p=0.0085). Conclusion: In our post COVID clinic, we observed several distinct clinical phenotypes. Fatigue-predominance was the most common presentation and was associated with elevated IL-6 levels and female gender. Dyspnea-predominance was more common in men and was not associated with elevated IL-6 levels. IL-6 levels were significantly elevated in patients with PASC and discordant with ESR and CRP, particularly in those with central sensitization phenotypes.","Ganesh, R.; Grach, S. L.; Bierle, D.

The results showed that the BKoV positive rate for the diarrheic feces (35.42%) was significantly higher than that for the non-diarrheic feces (11.69%, p < 0.001). Interestingly, three potential novel VP1 lineages were identified from 15 complete VP1 sequences, and a unique triple nucleotide insertion which can result in an aa insertion, was first observed in the 11/12 VP0 fragments with 660 bp long in this study, compared with known BKoV VP0 sequences. Moreover, the first Chinese BKoV genome was successfully obtained from a diarrheic fecal sample, named CHZ/CHINA. The open reading frame (ORF) of the genome from strain CHZ/China shares 87.4%–88.3% nucleotide (nt) and 93.7%–96.4% amino acid (aa) identity, compared with the three known genomes of BKoV. Interestingly, phylogenetic tree based on aa sequences of these genomes showed that CHZ/CHINA was clustered into an independent branch, suggesting the strain may represent a novel BKoV strain.

Here, we evaluated the immune responses in nonhuman primates that received 100 µg of mRNA-1273 vaccine at 0 and 4 weeks and were boosted at week 29 with mRNA-1273 (homologous) or mRNA-1273.β (heterologous), which encompasses the spike sequence of the B.1.351 (beta or β) variant. Reciprocal ID50 pseudovirus neutralizing antibody geometric mean titers (GMT) against live SARS-CoV-2 D614G and the β variant, were 4700 and 765, respectively, at week 6, the peak of primary response, and 644 and 553, respectively, at a 5-month post-vaccination memory time point. Two weeks following homologous or heterologous boost β-specific reciprocal ID50 GMT were 5000 and 3000, respectively. At week 38, animals were challenged in the upper and lower airway with the β variant. Two days post-challenge, viral replication was low to undetectable in both BAL and nasal swabs in most of the boosted animals. These data show that boosting with the homologous mRNA-1273 vaccine six months after primary immunization provides up to a 20-fold increase in neutralizing antibody responses across all VOC, which may be required to sustain high-level protection against severe disease, especially for at-risk populations.

Our frontline workers are under tremendous psychological pressure because of the ever-rising crisis. This study was done to assess the magnitude of the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on clinical and nonclinical HCWs in India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: It was a cross-sectional, online survey that was done from June 1, 2020, to July 4, 2020. A total of 313 clinical and nonclinical HCWs, who were directly or indirectly involved in patient care, participated in the study. The psychological impact was assessed in terms of four variables: insomnia, anxiety, depression, and stress. Insomnia was assessed by the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Anxiety and depression were assessed via the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4), which included a 2-item anxiety scale and a 2-item depression scale (PHQ-2). Stress was assessed via the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). We also compared the psychological impact of this pandemic between clinical and nonclinical HCWs. RESULTS: 7.3% of HCWs were having moderate insomnia, 3.8% had severe insomnia, and 20.8% were having subthreshold insomnia. Severe anxiety and depression were found in 6.7% of respondents. 8.0 and 32.3% of the respondents had moderate and mild anxiety–depression, respectively. 6.4% had high perceived stress. 47.6 and 46.0% of the respondents had moderate and low stress, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference in severe insomnia between clinical and nonclinical HCWs, whereas no significant difference in anxiety, depression, and stress between clinical and nonclinical HCWs. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that psychological morbidity is prevalent among both clinical and nonclinical HCWs and both males and females. Early intervention may be beneficial to prevent this issue. HOW TO CITE THIS ARTICLE: Sunil R, Bhatt MT, Bhumika TV, Thomas N, Puranik A, Chaudhuri S, et al.

There is limited information on the safety of drugs used for the treatment of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: Objective of this study is to describe the pattern of stimulated spontaneous adverse drug reaction (ADR) reports received from healthcare professionals for SARS-CoV-2 positive patients in Ghana and lessons learnt particularly for low- and middle-income countries. METHODS: This is a study of individual case safety reports (ICSRs) received from healthcare professionals between 1(st) April 2020 to 31(st) July 2020 in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients in Ghana. The ICSRs were retrieved from the SafetyWatch System and descriptive statistics used to describe the ADRs by System Organ Classification and Preferred Term. RESULTS: Information was received from 40 COVID-19 Treatment Centres across the country with 9 centres submitting a total of 53 ICSRs containing 101 ADRs; approximately two ADRs per ICSR. Females accounted for 29(54.7%) of the ICSRs and males 24(45.3%). Newly reported ADRs of interest were one report each of tremor for doxycycline; scrotal pain, dyspnoea, gait disturbances and dysgeusia for chloroquine; and dry throat, hyperhidrosis, restlessness and micturition frequency increased for hydroxychloroquine. A strong spontaneous system with the availability of focal persons at the Treatment Centres played a key role in reporting ADRs during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: This is the first experience with spontaneous reporting during COVID-19 pandemic in Ghana. The profile of most of the ADRs reported appears consistent with what is expected from the summary of product characteristics. A study with a larger sample size with well-defined denominator in future studies is paramount in determining the relative risk of these medications in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients.

Here, we tested a vaccine regimen in pigtail macaques using an intranasal (i.n.) recombinant Fowl Pox Virus (FPV)-gag pol env-IL-4R antagonist prime, intramuscular (i.m.) recombinant Modified Vaccinia Ankara Virus (MVA)-gag pol-IL-4R antagonist boost followed by an i.m SOSIP-gp140 boost. The viral vector—expressed IL-4R antagonist transiently inhibited IL-4/IL-13 signalling at the vaccination site. The SOSIP booster not only induced gp140-specific IgG, ADCC (antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity) and some neutralisation activity, but also bolstered the HIV-specific cellular and humoral responses. Specifically, superior sustained systemic and mucosal HIV Gag-specific poly-functional/cytotoxic CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were detected with the IL-4R antagonist adjuvanted strategy compared to the unadjuvanted control. In the systemic compartment elevated Granzyme K expression was linked to CD4(+) T cells, whilst Granzyme B/TIA-1 to CD8(+) T cells. In contrast, the cytotoxic marker expression by mucosal CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells differed according to the mucosal compartment. This vector-based mucosal IL-4R antagonist/SOSIP booster strategy, which promotes cytotoxic mucosal CD4(+) T cells at the first line of defence, and cytotoxic CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells plus functional antibodies in the blood, may prove valuable in combating mucosal infection with HIV-1 and warrants further investigation.","Li, Z.; Khanna, M.; Grimley, S.

652902,Impact of the gate-keeping policies of China’s primary healthcare model on the future burden of tuberculosis in China: a protocol for a mathematical modelling study,2021-08-25,"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in over 33 million confirmed cases and over 1 million deaths globally, as of 1 October 2020. During the lockdown and restrictions placed on public activities and gatherings, green spaces have become one of the only sources of resilience amidst the coronavirus pandemic, in part because of their positive effects on psychological, physical and social cohesion and spiritual wellness. This study analyzes the impacts of COVID-19 and government response policies to the pandemic on park visitation at global, regional and national levels and assesses the importance of parks during this global pandemic. The data we collected primarily from Google’s Community Mobility Reports and the Oxford Coronavirus Government Response Tracker. The results for most countries included in the analysis show that park visitation has increased since February 16th, 2020 compared to visitor numbers prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Restrictions on social gathering, movement, and the closure of workplace and indoor recreational places, are correlated with more visits to parks. Stay-at-home restrictions and government stringency index are negatively associated with park visits at a global scale. Demand from residents for parks and outdoor green spaces has increased since the outbreak began, and highlights the important role and benefits provided by parks, especially urban and community parks, under the COVID-19 pandemic. We provide recommendations for park managers and other decision-makers in terms of park management and planning during health crises, as well as for park design and development. In particular, parks could be utilized during pandemics to increase the physical and mental health and social well-being of individuals.

653771,Qualitative Study of the Psychological Experience of COVID-19 Patients during Hospitalization.,2020-08-24,"The proprotein convertases (PCs) are responsible for the maturation of precursor proteins, and are involved in multiple and critical biological processes. Over the past 30 years, the PCs have had great translational applications, but the physiological roles of PC7, the seventh member of the family, are still obscure. Searching for new substrates of PC7, a quantitative proteomics screen for selective enrichment of N-glycosylated polypeptides secreted from hepatic HuH7 cells identified two human type-II transmembrane proteins of unknown function(s): Cancer Susceptibility Candidate 4 (CASC4) and Golgi Phosphoprotein of 130 kDa (GPP130/GOLIM4). Concentrating on CASC4, its mutagenesis characterized the PC7/Furin-shedding site to occur at KR(66)↓NS, in HEK293 cells. We defined PC7 and Furin trafficking and activity, and demonstrated that CASC4 shedding occurs in acidic endosomes and/or in the trans-Golgi Network. Our data unraveled a cancer-protective role for CASC4, because siRNA silencing of endogenous CASC4 expression in the invasive triple-negative breast cancer human cell line MDA-MB-231 resulted in a significantly increased cellular migration and invasion. Conversely, MDA-MB-231 cells stably expressing CASC4 exhibited reduced migration and invasion, which can be explained by an increased number of paxillin-positive focal adhesions. This phenotypic cancer-protective role of CASC4 is reversed in cells overexpressing an optimally PC7/Furin-cleaved CASC4 mutant, or upon overexpression of the N-terminally convertase-generated membrane-bound segment. This phenotype was associated with increased formation of podosome-like structures, especially evident in cells overexpressing the N-terminal fragment. In accord, breast cancer patients’ data sets show that high CASC4 and PCSK7 expression levels predict a significantly worse prognosis compared to high CASC4 but low PCSK7 levels. In conclusion, CASC4 shedding not only disrupts its anti-migratory/invasive role, but also generates a membrane-bound fragment that drastically modifies the actin cytoskeleton, resulting in an enhanced cellular migration and invasion. This phenotype might be clinically relevant in the prognosis of breast cancer patients.","Duval, Stéphanie; Abu-Thuraia, Afnan; Elkholi, Islam E.; Chen, Rui; Seebun, Deeptee; Mayne, Janice; Côté, Jean-François; Figeys, Daniel; Seidah, Nabil G.",Cell Death Dis,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-020-02893-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32820145/,217

With recent BTV and AHSV outbreaks causing epidemics and important economy losses, there is a pressing need for efficacious drugs to treat and control the spread of these infections. The polyanionic aromatic compound aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) has been shown to have a broad-spectrum antiviral activity. Here, we evaluated ATA as a potential antiviral compound against Orbivirus infections in both mammalian and insect cells. Notably, ATA was able to prevent the replication of BTV and AHSV in both cell types in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. In addition, we evaluated the effect of ATA in vivo using a mouse model of infection. ATA did not protect mice against a lethal challenge with BTV or AHSV, most probably due to the in vivo effect of ATA on immune system regulation. Overall, these results demonstrate that ATA has inhibitory activity against Orbivirus replication in vitro, but further in vivo analysis will be required before considering it as a potential therapy for future clinical evaluation.","Alonso, Celia; Utrilla-Trigo, Sergio; Calvo-Pinilla, Eva; Jiménez-Cabello, Luis; Ortego, Javier; Nogales, Aitor",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21197294; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33023235/,217

Extreme social distancing and shielding in place for vulnerable patients during the COVID-19 pandemic has created both the challenge and the opportunity to provide care at a distance on a large scale. Available evidence suggests that glucose control has in fact improved during this period for people with diabetes who are able to use CGM devices for remote glucose monitoring. The development of telemedicine as part of the standard of care in diabetes faces significant challenges in the European context, particularly in terms of providing consistent and effective care at a distance to large populations of patients while using robust systems that can be supported by large regional and national healthcare services. These challenges include a fragmented approach to healthcare technology assessment and reimbursement, lack of eHealth education and literacy, particularly amongst healthcare professionals, lack of data integration, as well as concerns about electronic health records, patient consent and privacy. Here we review the benefits of and challenges to wider application of telemedicine and telemonitoring in the post-pandemic future, with the aim to ensure that the value of these eHealth services is provided to patients, healthcare providers and health systems.","Choudhary, Pratik; Bellido, Virginia; Graner, Matthijs; Altpeter, Bernd; Cicchetti, Americo; Durand-Zaleski, Isabelle; Kristensen, Finn Børlum",Diabetes Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34390477/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s13300-021-01132-9,217

All patients were enrolled from the Department of Dermatology between February 12 and May 8, 2020, the duration of 4 weeks before COVID‐19 and eight weeks after were analyzed in 3 parts consisting of 4 weeks. Data obtained from the database such as age, gender, diagnoses were anonymized. Repeated applications with the same diagnosis in ten days after the first presentation were ignored. Compared to the pre‐outbreak, there was a 3.5‐fold decrease in dermatology applications in the first month after COVID‐19 and an 8.8‐fold in the second month. We found a significant increase in the frequency of diagnoses such as generalized pruritus, pityriasis rosea, alopecia areata, bacterial skin/mucosa diseases, and zona zoster after COVID‐19. The frequency declined in diseases such as verruca vulgaris, hyperpigmentation, skin tag, melanocytic nevus, seborrheic keratosis/solar lentigo. It has been found that the frequencies of most diseases, including acne (⁓25% of patients), did not change. We think that many factors, such as affecting the quality of life, risk perception, increased stress burden may cause a change in the diagnostic distribution of the dermatology applications.

Given that COVID-19 is less deadly for young adults, this study explores whether highlighting potential benefits or disadvantages that others may experience as a result of one's vaccination increases young adults' intention to get vaccinated, particularly for those who have low perceived risk of COVID-19. To test this idea, we conducted an experiment and analyzed the effect of interaction between message frame (gain vs. loss) and reference point (self vs. others) on intention for vaccination by one's perceived risk (low vs. high). The results show that for those with low perceived risk of COVID-19, messages about potential negative consequences to others (e.g., family, friends, community members) from one's failure to get vaccinated led to message elaboration and favorable attitude toward vaccination, which in turn promoted one's intention to get vaccinated. We discuss practical implications of the findings for message strategies that target populations experiencing COVID-19 disparities.","Hong, Yangsun; Hashimoto, Mika",Health Commun,https://doi.org/10.1080/10410236.2021.1978668; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34544315/,217
657232,Barriers to Infant Preventive Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2021-10-01,"Virus entry, consisting of attachment to and penetration into the host target cell, is the first step of the virus life cycle and is a critical ‘do or die’ event that governs virus emergence in host populations. Most antiviral vaccines induce neutralizing antibodies that prevent virus entry into cells. However, while the prevention of virus invasion by humoral immunity is well appreciated, considerably less is known about the immune defences present within cells (known as intrinsic immunity) that interfere with virus entry. The interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) proteins, known for inhibiting fusion between viral and cellular membranes, were once the only factors known to restrict virus entry. However, the progressive development of genetic and pharmacological screening platforms and the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic have galvanized interest in how viruses infiltrate cells and how cells defend against it. Several host factors with antiviral potential are now implicated in the regulation of virus entry, including cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H), lymphocyte antigen 6E (LY6E), nuclear receptor co-activator protein 7 (NCOA7), interferon-γ-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase (GILT), CD74 and ARFGAP with dual pleckstrin homology domain-containing protein 2 (ADAP2). This Review summarizes what is known and what remains to be understood about the intrinsic factors that form the first line of defence against virus infection.","Majdoul, Saliha; Compton, Alex A.",Nat Rev Immunol,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41577-021-00626-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34646033/,217

The aim of this study was to describe the complete clinical spectrum of COVID-19, based on a nationwide cohort with extensive diagnostic testing and a rigorous contact tracing approach. Methods: A population-based cohort study examining symptom progression using prospectively recorded data on all individuals with a positive test (RT-PCR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) who were enrolled in a telehealth monitoring service provided to all identified cases in Iceland. Symptoms were systematically monitored from diagnosis to recovery. Results: From January 31 to April 30, 2020, a total of 45,105 individuals (12% of the Icelandic population) were tested for SARS-CoV-2, of whom 1797 were positive, yielding a population incidence of 5 per 1000 individuals. The most common presenting symptoms were myalgia (55%), headache (51%), and non-productive cough (49%).

This situation has highlighted the need for a deeply rooted understanding of the health information–seeking behaviors (HISBs) of people. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to review and provide insight regarding methodologies and the construct of content in HISB surveys by answering the following research question: what are the characteristics of the measurement tools for assessing HISBs in nationally representative surveys around the world? METHODS: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses was used as the framework for this study. A data search was performed through 5 international and 2 Korean databases covering the years between 2008 and 2020. Initially, studies performed among nationally representative samples were included to discover HISB survey instruments. The methodologies of the studies using HISB surveys were analyzed. For content analysis, 2 researchers reached a consensus through discussion by scrutinizing the contents of each survey questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 13 survey tools from 8 countries were identified after a review of 2333 records from the search results. Five survey tools (Health Information National Trends Survey, Health Tracking Survey, Annenberg National Health Communication Survey, National Health Interview Survey, and Health Tracking Household Survey) from the United States, 2 instruments from Germany, and 1 tool from each of the countries of the European Union, France, Israel, Poland, South Korea, and Taiwan were identified. Telephone or web-based surveys were commonly used targeting the adult population (≥15 years of age). From the content analysis, the domains of the survey items were categorized as follows: information (information about health and patient medical records), channel (offline and online), and health (overall health, lifestyle, and cancer). All categories encompassed behavioral and attitude dimensions. A theoretical framework, that is, an information-channel-health structure for HISBs was proposed. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study can contribute to the development and implementation of the survey tools for HISB with integrated questionnaire items. This will help in understanding HISB trends in national health care.","Choi, Hanna; Jeong, Gyeonghui",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34309573/; https://doi.org/10.2196/27539,217

660192,Integrating Transwomen and Female Athletes with Differences of Sex Development (DSD) into Elite Competition: The FIMS 2021 Consensus Statement,2021-03-24,"Early detection of infection with SARS-CoV-2 is key to managing the current global pandemic, as evidence shows the virus is most contagious on or before symptom onset. Here, we introduce a low-cost, high-throughput method for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, dubbed Pathogen-Oriented Low-Cost Assembly & Re-Sequencing (POLAR), that enhances sensitivity by aiming to amplify the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome rather than targeting particular viral loci, as in typical RT-PCR assays. To achieve this goal, we combine a SARS-CoV-2 enrichment method developed by the ARTIC Network (https://artic.network/) with short-read DNA sequencing and de novo genome assembly. We are able to reliably (>95% accuracy) detect SARS-CoV-2 at concentrations of 84 genome equivalents per milliliter, better than the reported limits of detection of almost all diagnostic methods currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. At higher concentrations, we are able to reliably assemble the SARS-CoV-2 genome in the sample, often with no gaps and perfect accuracy. Such genome assemblies enable the spread of the disease to be analyzed much more effectively than would be possible with an ordinary yes/no diagnostic, and can help identify vaccine and drug targets. Finally, we show that POLAR diagnoses on 10 of 10 clinical nasopharyngeal swab samples (half positive, half negative) match those obtained in a CLIA-certified lab using the Center for Disease Control’s 2019-Novel Coronavirus test. Using POLAR, a single person can process 192 samples over the course of an 8-hour experiment, at a cost of ∼$30/patient, enabling a 24-hour turnaround with sequencing and data analysis time included. Further testing and refinement will likely enable greater enhancements in the sensitivity of the above approach.","St Hilaire, Brian Glenn; Durand, Neva C.; Mitra, Namita; Pulido, Saul Godinez; Mahajan, Ragini; Blackburn, Alyssa; Colaric, Zane L.; Theisen, Joshua W.

Multi-modality tobacco treatment increases rates of successful cessation by at least 20%. The COVID-19 pandemic has put a halt to many inpatient and outpatient medical visits deemed non-essential, including tobacco treatment. The transition to telehealth has been wrought with challenges. While data on the association between COVID-19 and tobacco products is mixed, the overall health consequences of tobacco point towards increased risk of morbidity and mortality associated with the virus. This leaves smoking as one of the few readily modifiable risk factors in an environment understandably not set up to prioritize cessation. A military health facility on Fort Eustis in Virginia runs a successful tobacco treatment program and adapted it to pandemic times. This paper describes the process and lessons learned from this initiative.

661104,A Systematic Review on the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Neurosurgical Practice and Indian Perspective,2021-02-23,"OBJECTIVE: The worldwide pandemic involving the novel respiratory syndrome (COVID-19) has forced healthcare systems to delay elective operations, including abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair, to conserve resources. This study provides a structured analysis of the decision to delay AAA repair and quantify the potential for harm. METHODS: A decision tree was constructed modeling immediate repair of AAA relative to an initial non-operative (delayed repair) approach. Risk of COVID-19 contraction and mortality, aneurysm rupture, and operative mortality were considered. A deterministic sensitivity analysis for a range of patient ages (50 to >80), probability of COVID-19 infection (0.01%-30%), aneurysm size (5.5->7cm), and time horizons (3-9 months) was performed. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were conducted for three representative ages (60, 70, 80). Analyses were conducted for endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) and open surgical repair (OSR). RESULTS: Patients with aneurysms 7cm or greater demonstrated a higher probability of survival when treated with immediate EVAR or OSR, compared to delayed repair, for patients under 80 years of age. When considering EVAR for aneurysms 5.5-6.9cm, immediate repair had a higher probability of survival except in settings with high probability of COVID-19 infection (10-30%) and advanced age (70-85+ years). A non-operative strategy maximized the probability of survival as patient age or operative risk increased. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses demonstrated that patients with large aneurysms (>7cm) faced a 5.4-7.7% absolute increase in the probability of mortality with a delay of repair of 3 months. Young patients (60-70 years) with 6-6.9cm aneurysms demonstrated an elevated risk of mortality (1.5-1.9%) with a delay of 3 months. Those with 5-5.9cm aneurysms demonstrated an increased survival with immediate repair in young patients (60), however this was small in magnitude (0.2-0.8%). The potential for harm increased as length of surgical delay increased. For elderly patients requiring OSR, in the context of endemic COVID-19, delay of repair improves probability of survival. CONCLUSION: The decision to delay operative repair of AAA should consider both patient age and local COVID-19 prevalence in addition to aneurysm size. EVAR should be considered when possible due to a reduced risk of harm and lower resource utilization.","McGuinness, Brandon; Troncone, Michael; James, Lyndon P.; Bisch, Steve; Iyer, Vikram",J Vasc Surg,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvs.2020.08.115; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0741521420320000?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0741521420320000; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32882347/,217

661348,COVID-19 consent and return to elective orthopaedic surgery: allowing a true patient choice?,2020-09-14,"BACKGROUND: There has been widespread concern that the COVID‐19 pandemic may be a high‐risk time for alcohol use among heavy drinking populations such as college students. Initial efforts to evaluate changes in college drinking have not yet accounted for typical drinking patterns within a semester. METHODS: To fill this gap, we evaluated how college student drinking patterns changed with the onset of restrictions related to the COVID‐19 pandemic during spring 2020 relative to spring 2018 and 2019. Participants were 1,365 college students aged 19 and older, including 895 students who reported past‐month alcohol use. Daily drinking data were extracted from an online Timeline Followback survey. RESULTS: Negative binomial hurdle models revealed that, with the onset of the COVID‐19 pandemic in spring 2020, college student drinkers did not increase their drinking frequency as was typical in late spring semester, and the number of drinks per occasion declined substantially (28% reduction), greater than the change observed from early to late spring 2018 (3% reduction) or spring 2019 (8% increase). This reduction in drinking quantity in spring 2020 was larger for college student drinkers who moved residences because of the pandemic (49% reduction) than students who did not move (21% reduction). Perceptions in pandemic‐related changes in drinking also revealed that 83.5% of college student drinkers self‐reported that their drinking stayed the same or decreased. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that, on average, college students drank less—not more—during the onset of the COVID‐19 pandemic and highlight the importance of living situation in college student drinking behavior. More research is needed to assess alcohol use in other universities, as this information could be utilized in norms‐based interventions to further reduce drinking in students who remain at risk.","Jaffe, Anna E.; Kumar, Shaina A.; Ramirez, Jason J.; DiLillo, David",Alcohol Clin Exp Res,https://doi.org/10.1111/acer.14572; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33755213/,217

Samples were collected from broiler flocks in Bushehr province during 2014 - 2015. These flocks had respiratory problems such as gasping, sneezing and bronchial rales. A number of 135 tracheal swabs were taken from fifteen flocks (nine swabs per flock). Each three swabs collected from each flock were pooled in one tube (finally, we had three tubes for each flock). The samples were subjected to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The PCR products of positive samples were analyzed by sequencing of a (392 bp) segment of the spike gene and the related results were compared with the other IBV sequences in GenBank database. Samples from twelve farms (80.0%) were found to be positive. The viruses from seven farms (46.6%) were identified as field viruses closely related to variant 2. The viruses from three farms (20.0%) were characterized as Mass type and were related to vaccine strains. Two different IB viruses (variant 2 and Mass) were detected in samples from two farms (13.3%). The variant 2 genotype detected in Bushehr had high similarity to variant 2 reported from the Middle East. These variants displayed homologies ranging from 72.9% to 76.5%, and 78.8% to 80.0% with H120 and 4/91, respectively. It is necessary to design vaccination program of poultry farms using IBV strains circulating in the region.","Saadat, Yousef; Bozorgmehri Fard, Mohammad Hassan; Charkhkar, Saied; Hosseini, Hossein; Shaikhi, Nariman; Akbarpour, Bijan",Vet Res Forum,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29085606/,217

No single laboratory data can currently distinguish KD from other febrile infection diseases. The purpose of this study was to establish a laboratory data model that can differentiate between KD and other febrile diseases caused by an infection in order to prevent coronary artery complications in KD. Methods: This study consisted of a total of 800 children (249 KD and 551 age- and gender-matched non-KD febrile infection illness) as a case-control study. Laboratory findings were analyzed using univariable, multivariable logistic regression, and nomogram models. Results: We selected 562 children at random as the model group and 238 as the validation group. The predictive nomogram included high eosinophil percentage (100 points), high C-reactive protein (93 points), high alanine transaminase (84 points), low albumin (79 points), and high white blood cell (64 points), which generated an area under the curve of 0.873 for the model group and 0.905 for the validation group. Eosinophilia showed the highest OR: 5.015 (95% CI:−3.068–8.197) during multiple logistic regression. The sensitivity and specificity in the validation group were 84.1 and 86%, respectively. The calibration curves of the validation group for the probability of KD showed near an agreement to the actual probability. Conclusion: Eosinophilia is a major factor in this nomogram model and had high precision for predicting KD.

Because to the technological advancements that promote interconnectedness and value co-creation, the field has consequently spun off into more domain-specific branches, such as the arena of digital business ecosystems that are driven by Internet of Things (IoT). Nonetheless, despite the efforts to mend the theoretical foundations and to close the gap between academia and empirical practice, the absolute majority of IoT-driven digital business ecosystem literature follows the trend of conceptual randomness while expanding the volume of publications exponentially. Therefore, in order to address this unfavourable increase in random adoption of distinct concepts that ultimately refer to the same subject matter, the author encourages other scholars involved in the research field of IoT-driven digital business ecosystems to make extended efforts and support the external validity of their research (as well as the relevance of the research stream as a whole) by bounding the IoT-driven digital business ecosystems on a rigorous basis through deploying the extant theory in a careful and appropriate manner. Via a thorough examination of the theoretical fundaments that underpin the concept of IoT-driven digital business ecosystem, and based on a concise thematic review of corresponding literature published until September 2020, this article articulates logic for viewing the conceptual hierarchy within the business ecosystem research and proposes six literature-based recommendations for developing further IoT-driven digital business ecosystem (DBE) research in a rigorous way.","Rezac, Fabien",Sensors (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/s20205842; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33076487/,217
663175,Commentary: Mandatory covid vaccination blames individual care home workers for government failures,2021,"O'nyong nyong virus (ONNV) and Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) are two closely related alphaviruses with very different infection patterns in the mosquito, Anopheles gambiae. ONNV is the only alphavirus transmitted by anopheline mosquitoes, but specific molecular determinants of infection of this unique vector specificity remain unidentified. Fifteen distinct chimeric viruses were constructed to evaluate both structural and non-structural regions of the genome and infection patterns were determined through artificial infectious feeds in An. gambiae with each of these chimeras. Only one region, non-structural protein 3 (nsP3), was sufficient to up-regulate infection to rates similar to those seen with parental ONNV. When ONNV non-structural protein 3 (nsP3) replaced nsP3 from CHIKV virus in one of the chimeric viruses, infection rates in An. gambiae went from 0% to 63.5%. No other single gene or viral region addition was able to restore infection rates. Thus, we have shown that a non-structural genome element involved in viral replication is a major element involved in ONNV's unique vector specificity.","Saxton-Shaw, Kali D.; Ledermann, Jeremy P.; Borland, Erin M.; Stovall, Janae L.; Mossel, Eric C.; Singh, Amber J.; Wilusz, Jeffrey; Powers, Ann M.",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0001931; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23359824/,217

Three-hundred respondents were recruited for the study. Data were analyzed using SPSS 22.0, descriptive statistics were presented in tables and charts while the hypotheses were tested with Chi-square at a significant level of p = 0.05. RESULTS: The findings revealed that the mean and standard deviation of the respondents was 22.16± 3.11 years; 61.7% were ready for clinical practice, 92(30.7%) were ready to nurse coronavirus patients. There is a significant difference between nursing institutions and readiness for clinical practice p = 0.000. There is no significant difference between years of clinical exposure and readiness for clinical practice p = 0.594.

Our hypothesis was that the renal blood flow could be more compromised in SARS-CoV-2 patients than in patients with “classical” ARDS. We compared the renal resistivity index (RRI) and the renal venous flow (RVF) in ARDS patients with SARS-CoV-2 and in ARDS patients due to other etiologies. Prospective, observational pilot study performed on 30 mechanically ventilated patients (15 with SARS-COV-2 ARDS and 15 with ARDS). Mechanical ventilation settings included constant-flow controlled ventilation, a tidal volume of 6 ml/kg of ideal body weight and the PEEP level titrated to the lowest driving pressure. Ultrasound Doppler measurements of RRI and RVF pattern were performed in each patient. Patients with SARS-COV-2 ARDS had higher RRI than patients with ARDS (0.71[0.67–0.78] vs 0.64[0.60–0.74], p = 0.04). RVF was not-continuous in 9/15 patients (71%) in the SARS-COV-2 ARDS group and in and 5/15 (33%) in the ARDS group (p = 0.27).

We aimed to collate global experience and provide provisional guidance for managing paediatric IBD (PIBD) in the era of COVID-19. METHODS: An electronic reporting system of children with IBD infected with SARS-CoV-2 has been circulated among 102 PIBD centres affiliated with the Porto and Interest-group of ESPGHAN. A survey has been completed by major PIBD centres in China and South-Korea to explore management during the pandemic. A third survey collected current practice of PIBD treatment. Finally, guidance points for practice have been formulated and voted upon by 37 PIBD authors and Porto group members. RESULTS: Eight PIBD children had COVID-19 globally, all with mild infection without needing hospitalization despite treatment with immunomodulators and/or biologics. No cases have been reported in China and South Korea but biologic treatment has been delayed in 79 children, of whom 17 (22%) had exacerbation of their IBD. Among the Porto group members, face-to-face appointments were often replaced by remote consultations but almost all did not change current IBD treatment. Ten guidance points for clinicians caring for PIBD patients in epidemic areas have been endorsed with consensus rate of 92% to 100%. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary data for PIBD patients during COVID-19 outbreak are reassuring. Standard IBD treatments including biologics should continue at present through the pandemic, especially in children who generally have more severe IBD course on one hand, and milder SARS-CoV-2 infection on the other.

The pandemic monitor of the German Society for Urology was able to record the restrictions on patient care in urological practices and clinics by means of regular surveys of the members. A total of 689 responses at four survey time points were included. In April there was a reduction in urological inpatients to 44% and the number of patients in practices dropped to 50%. Available operating theater capacities for urological patients were 45% in April, normalized to 90% in June and fell again to 50% in December. Elective operations could not be performed at all or only to a very limited extent in most hospitals in April and December. While urgent operations could be treated to 100% in more than 75% of the clinics in April, in December more than half of the clinics stated that they could not treat all patients with urgent indications. To some extent (8–19%) practices and clinics had to resort to a pandemic-related supraregional referral of patients. The reduction of outpatients in urological practices in April normalized to 95% in June and remained stable during the second wave of the pandemic. The increase in urological emergencies in practices observed at the beginning of the pandemic did not show up in November and December.

664606,Pain and Anxiety due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. A Survey of Patients with Delayed Elective Hip and Knee Arthroplasty,2021-05-28,"BACKGROUND: Neutralization tests (NT) are the gold standard for detecting and quantifying anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (NAb), but their complexity restricts them to research settings or reference laboratories. Antibodies against S protein receptor binding domain (RBD) have been shown to confer a neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2. Assays quantitatively measuring anti-S1-RBD-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies could be of great value for NAb screening of potential donors for convalescent-phase plasma therapy, assessing natural or vaccine-induced immunity, stratifying individuals for vaccine receipt, and documenting vaccine response. METHODS: Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S (Elecsys-S), a high-throughput automated electrochemiluminescence double-antigen sandwich immunoassay for quantitative measurement of pan-anti-S1-RBD-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, was evaluated against NT on 357 patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. NT was performed in a BSL-3 laboratory using a Slovenian SARS-CoV-2 isolate; the NT titer ≥1:20 was considered positive. RESULTS: Elecsys-S detected pan-anti-S1-RBD-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 352/357 (98.6 %) samples. NAb were identified by NT in 257/357 (72 %) samples. The Elecsys-S/NT agreement was moderate (Cohen’s kappa 0.56). High NT titer antibodies (≥1:160) were detected in 106/357 (30 %) samples. Elecsys-S’s pan-anti-S1-RBD-SARS-CoV-2 antibody concentrations correlated with individual NT titer categories (the lowest concentrations were identified in NT-negative samples and the highest in samples with NT titer 1:1,280), and the Elecsys-S cutoff value for reasonable prediction of NAb generated after natural infection was established (133 BAU/mL). CONCLUSION: Although NT should remain the gold standard for assessing candidates for convalescent-phase plasma donors, selected commercial anti-SARS-CoV-2 assays with optimized cutoff, like Elecsys-S, could be used for rapid, automated, and large-scale screening of individuals with clinically relevant NAb levels as suitable donors.","Resman Rus, Katarina; Korva, Miša; Knap, Nataša; Avšič Županc, Tatjana; Poljak, Mario",J Clin Virol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653221000871; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2021.104820; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653221000871?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33865031/,217

In simple viruses, the capsid consists of a number of copies of the same, or a few different proteins organized into a symmetric oligomer. Structurally complex viruses present a larger variety of components in their capsids than simple viruses. They may contain accessory proteins with specific architectural or functional roles; or incorporate non-proteic elements such as lipids. They present a range of geometrical variability, from slight deviations from the icosahedral symmetry to complete asymmetry or even pleomorphism. Putting together the many different elements in the virion requires an extra effort to achieve correct assembly, and thus complex viruses require sophisticated mechanisms to regulate morphogenesis. This chapter provides a general view of the structure and assembly of complex viruses.","San Martín, Carmen",Structure and Physics of Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23737057/; https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_11,217

METHODS: A survey was distributed using social media and organizational emails to Brazilian active health care professionals during the COVID-19 outbreak. We explored potential associated factors including age, gender, occupation, workplace, work hours, income, previous infection with COVID-19, recent/current contact with COVID-19 patients, regional number of incident deaths, anxiety, and burnout. We evaluated new-onset/ previous insomnia worsening episodes (primary outcome), new pharmacological treatments, sleep quality, duration, nightmares and snoring (secondary outcomes). RESULTS: A total of 4,384 health professionals from all regions of the country were included in the analysis (44±12 years, 76% females, 53.8% physicians). Overall, 55.7% were assisting patients with COVID-19, and 9.2% had a previous COVID-19 infection. The primary outcome occurred in 32.9% of respondents in parallel to 13% new pharmacological treatments for insomnia. The sleep quality worsened for 61.4%, while 43.5% and 22.8% reported &#8805;1-hour sleep duration reduction and worsening or new-onset nightmares, respectively.

665406,Review of COVID-19 Vaccines and Their Evidence in Older Adults,2021-02-04,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether any specific acute care surgery patient populations are associated with a higher incidence of COVID-19 infection. BACKGROUND: Acute care providers may be exposed to an increased risk of contracting the COVID-19 infection since many patients present to the emergency department without complete screening measures. However, it is not known which patients present with the highest incidence. METHODS: All acute care surgery (ACS) patients who presented to our level I trauma center between March 19, 2020, and September 20, 2020 and were tested for COVID-19 were included in the study. The patients were divided into two cohorts: COVID positive (+) and COVID negative (-). Patient demographics, type of consultation (emergency general surgery consults [EGS], interpersonal violence trauma consults [IPV], and non-interpersonal violence trauma consults [NIPV]), clinical data and outcomes were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to compare differences between the groups. RESULTS: In total, 2177 patients met inclusion criteria. Of these, 116 were COVID+ (5.3%) and 2061 were COVID- (94.7%). COVID+ patients were more frequently Latinos (64.7% vs 61.7%, p=0.043) and African Americans (18.1% vs 11.2%, p<0.001) and less frequently Caucasian (6.0% vs 14.1%, p<0.001). Asian/Filipino/Pacific Islander (7.8% vs 7.2%, p=0.059) and Native American/Other/Unknown (3.4% vs 5.8%, p=0.078) groups showed no statistical difference in COVID incidence. Mortality, hospital and ICU lengths of stay were similar between the groups and across patient populations stratified by the type of consultation. Logistic regression demonstrated higher odds of COVID+ infection amongst IPV patients (OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.62-7.56, p<0.001) compared to other ACS consultation types. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that victims of interpersonal violence were more likely positive for COVID-19, while in hospital outcomes were similar between COVID-19 positive and negative patients.

Typical presentation includes thunderclap/progressive headache or transient focal neurological symptoms; rare manifestations include seizures, intractable vomiting, or altered mental status. Here, we report the first case of convexal subarachnoid hemorrhage and multifocal ischemic lesions caused by infective endocarditis (IE) in a treatment-naïve advanced HIV patient. CASE REPORT: A 52-year-old HAART-naïve, HIV-positive, African American man presented with altered mental status, shortness of breath, nonproductive cough, and generalized weakness. His past medical history was significant for congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and end-stage renal disease (noncompliant with hemodialysis). Head computed tomography (CT) showed an isolated sulcal hemorrhage in the mid-left frontal lobe. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery/gradient recalled echo sequences confirmed a hemorrhage in the left-mid-frontal sulcus, and diffusion-weighted imaging revealed multifocal bilateral ischemic lesions. Transesophageal echocardiography exhibited mitral valve vegetations. Multifocal ischemic lesions and cSAH caused by infectious endocarditis were confirmed. Initiation of intravenous vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam allowed the patient to have resolution of his altered mental status. A head CT 5 days later revealed the resolution of cSAH. CONCLUSIONS: Infective endocarditis should be considered as an underlying etiology of cSAH, especially when present with multifocal ischemic lesions. Risk factors contributing to the development of cSAH in the IE patient population should be explored in future studies. HIV has not been previously reported in this subgroup and its prevalence should be considered. The prognosis for cSAH in relation to IE is generally favorable.","Khan, Faisal; Sharma, Neha; Din, Moin Ud; Shirke, Saloni; Abbas, Saima",Am J Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33986239/; https://doi.org/10.12659/ajcr.931376,217

Interdependence between regional pandemic burden and individual outcome remains unknown. The study aimed to assess the association between ICU bed occupancy and case fatality rate of critically ill COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed in France, using the national hospital discharge database from March to May, 2020. All patients admitted to ICU for COVID-19 were included. Case fatality was described according to: (i) patient’s characteristics (age, sex, comorbid conditions, ICU interventions); (ii) hospital’s characteristics (baseline ICU experience assessed by the number of ICU stays in 2019, number of ICU physicians per bed), and (iii) the regional outbreak-related profiles (workload indicator based on ICU bed occupancy). The determinants of lethal outcome were identified using a logistic regression model. RESULTS: 14,513 COVID-19 patients were admitted to ICU; 4256 died (29.3%), with important regional inequalities in case fatality (from 17.6 to 33.5%). Older age, multimorbidity and clinical severity were associated with higher mortality, as well as a lower baseline ICU experience of the health structure. Regions with more than 10 days with ≥ 75% of ICU occupancy by COVID-19 patients experienced an excess of mortality (up to adjusted OR = 2.2 [1.9–2.6] for region with the highest occupancy rate of ICU beds). CONCLUSIONS: The regions with the highest burden of care in ICU were associated with up to 2.2-fold increase of death rate.

L’efficacité in vitro de la chloroquine contre le SARS-CoV-2 a été décrite [2], ainsi que la supériorité potentielle de l’hydroxycholoroquine. De nombreuses études in vivo ont été menées. Il existe peu de données sur l’impact d’un traitement au long cours par hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) sur l’infection à SARS CoV-2 et les tests diagnostiques. Nous avons pour cela analysé les données des patients atteints de COVID-19 et suivis pour un rhumatisme inflammatoire chronique et/ou une maladie auto-immune systémique (iRMD-COVID-19) selon la prise ou non d’hydroxychloroquine comme DMARD. PATIENTS ET MÉTHODES: Les patients ont été inclus à partir de la cohorte française iRMD-COVID-19 [3]. Les données cliniques, diagnostiques et d’évolution de l’infection à SARS CoV-2 des patients traités au préalable par HCQ ont été comparées à celle des patients n’ayant pas de traitement par HCQ au moment de l’infection. Les critères d’appariement étaient l’âge, le sexe, les comorbidités, un traitement immunosuppresseur, et l’utilisation de la PCR nasale. RÉSULTATS: Parmi les 871 patients, 82 patients étaient traités par HCQ. Soixante et onze cas traités par HCQ ont pu être appariés et comparés à 191 témoins. Le taux de PCR nasale positive était de 85 % dans le groupe HCQ contre 81 % dans le groupe contrôle (absolute standardized difference = 6,0 %). Il n’y avait pas de différence significative entre les cas et les contrôles concernant les signes cliniques, le taux d’hospitalisation (33,8 % vs 27,7 % ; OR = 1,75 (0,86-3,56) ; p = 0,12), le taux d’admission en soins intensifs (11,3 % vs 9,4 % ; OR= 1,94 (0,69-5,41) ; p = 0,21) et le taux de décès (5,9 % vs 6,6 % ; OR = 1,10 (0,30-4,04) ; p = 0,89). CONCLUSION: Chez les patients atteints de COVID-19 et suivis pour un rhumatisme inflammatoire chronique et/ou une maladie auto-immune systémique de la cohorte French RMD Covid 19, la prise d’HCQ comme DMARD n’a pas modifié le taux de positivité de la PCR nasale, n’a pas modifié la présentation clinique et n’a pas prévenu la survenue de forme sévère de l’infection à SARS CoV-2 comparativement aux patients sans HCQ.","Trefond, L.; Drumez, E.; Andre, M.; Costedoat-Chalumeau, N.; Seror, R.; Devaux, M.; Dernis, E.; Dieudonné, Y.; Lanteri, A.; Melki, I.; Queyrel, V.; Roumier, M.; Schmidt, J.; Barnetche, T.; Thomas, T.; Cacoub, P.; Belot, A.; Aumaître, O.; Richez, C.; Hachulla, E.",Rev Med Interne,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0248866321003118; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0248866321003118,217

The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to explore the association of pre-existing conditions with COVID-19 mortality. Methods We searched MEDLINE, OVID databases, SCOPUS, and medrxiv.org for the period December 1, 2019, to May 1, 2020. The outcome of interest was the risk of COVID-19 mortality in patients with and without pre-existing conditions. Comorbidities explored were cardiovascular diseases (coronary artery disease, hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, and congestive heart failure), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer, chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease, and stroke. Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. All analyses were performed using random-effects models and heterogeneity was quantified. Results Ten chronic conditions from 19 studies were included in the meta-analysis (n = 61,455 patients with COVID-19; mean age, 61 years; 57% male). Overall the between-study study heterogeneity was medium and studies had low publication bias and high quality. Coronary heart disease, hypertension, congestive heart failure, and cancer significantly increased the risk of mortality from COVID-19. The risk of mortality from COVID-19 in patients with coronary heart disease was 2.4 times as high as those without coronary heart disease (RR= 2.40, 95%CI=1.71-3.37, n=5) and twice as high in patients with hypertension as high as that compared to those without hypertension (RR=1.89, 95%CI= 1.58-2.27, n=9). Patients with cancer also were at twice the risk of mortality from COVID-19 compared to those without cancer (RR=1.93 95%CI 1.15-3.24, n=4), and those with congestive heart failure were at 2.5 times the risk of mortality compared to those without congestive heart failure (RR=2.66, 95%CI 1.58-4.48, n=3). Conclusions COVID-19 patients with all any cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, hypertension, congestive heart failure, and cancer have an increased risk of mortality. Tailored infection prevention and treatment strategies targeting this high-risk population are warranted to optimize survival.","Ssentongo, Paddy; Ssentongo, Anna E.; Heilbrunn, Emily S.; Ba, Djibril M; Chinchilli, Vernon M.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.10.20097253; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.10.20097253v1?rss=1,217

Advancements in technology (e.g., digital devices and mHealth) enrich our ability to collect social networks and health data. The purpose of this scoping review was to identify and map the use of technology in measuring older adults' social networks for health and social care. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Joanna Briggs Institute methodology was followed. PubMed (MEDLINE), Sociological Abstracts, SocINDEX, CINAHL, and Web of Science were searched for relevant articles. Conference abstracts and proceedings were searched via Conference Papers Index, the American Sociological Society, and The Gerontological Society of America. Studies published in English from January 2004 to March 2020 that aimed to improve health or social care for older adults and used technology to measure social networks were included. Data were extracted by two independent reviewers using an a priori extraction tool. RESULTS: The majority of the 18 reviewed studies were pilot or simulation research conducted in Europe that focused on older adults living in the community. The various types of technologies used can be categorized as environment-based, person-based, and data-based. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Technology facilitates objective and longitudinal data collection on the social interactions and activities of older adults. The use of technology to measure older adults' social networks, however, is primarily in an exploratory phase. Multidisciplinary collaborations are needed to overcome operational, analytical, and implementation challenges. Future studies should leverage technologies for addressing social isolation and care for older adults, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Wei, Sijia; Kang, Bada; Bailey, Donald E; Caves, Kevin; Lin, Yufen; McConnell, Eleanor S; Thurow, Maria; Woodward, Amanda; Wright-Freeman, Kayla; Xue, Tingzhong (Michelle); Corazzini, Kirsten N",Gerontologist,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33754150/; https://doi.org/10.1093/geront/gnab039,217

Kuwait has a unique demographic profile with two-thirds of the population consisting of non-nationals, most of which are migrant workers. We aimed to explore whether there is a significant difference in health outcomes between non-Kuwaiti and Kuwaiti patients diagnosed with COVID-19. METHODS: We used a prospective COVID-19 registry of all patients (symptomatic and asymptomatic) in Kuwait who tested positive from February 24th to April 20th, 2020, collected from Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Hospital, the officially-designated COVID-19 healthcare facility in the country. We ran separate logistic regression models comparing non-Kuwaitis to Kuwaitis for death, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pneumonia. RESULTS: The first 1123 COVID-19 positive patients in Kuwait were all recruited in the study. About 26% were Kuwaitis and 73% were non-Kuwaiti. With adjustments made to age, gender, smoking and selected co-morbidities, non-Kuwaitis had two-fold increase in the odds of death or being admitted to the intensive care unit compared to Kuwaitis (OR: 2.14, 95% CI 1.12–4.32). Non-Kuwaitis had also higher odds of ARDS (OR:2.44, 95% CI 1.23–5.09) and pneumonia (OR: 2.24, 95% CI 1.27–4.12). CONCLUSION: This is the first study to report on COVID-19 outcomes between Kuwaiti and non-Kuwaiti patients. The current pandemic may have amplified the differences of health outcomes among marginalized subpopulations. A number of socioeconomic and environmental factors could explain this health disparity. More research is needed to advance the understanding of policymakers in Kuwait in order to make urgent public health interventions.","Hamadah, Hala; Alahmad, Barrak; Behbehani, Mohammad; Al-Youha, Sarah; Almazeedi, Sulaiman; Al-Haddad, Mohannad; Jamal, Mohammad H.; Al-Sabah, Salman",BMC Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32912230/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-020-09490-y,217

We evaluated three heat inactivation protocols (56 °C-30 min, 60 °C-60 min and 92 °C-15 min) on SARS-CoV-2 using (i) infected cell culture supernatant, (ii) virus-spiked human sera (iii) and nasopharyngeal samples according to the recommendations of the European norm NF EN 14476-A2. Regardless of the protocol and the type of samples, a 4 Log(10) TCID50 reduction was observed. However, samples containing viral loads > 6 Log(10) TCID(50) were still infectious after 56 °C-30 min and 60 °C-60 min, although infectivity was < 10 TCID(50). The protocols 56 °C-30 min and 60 °C-60 min had little influence on the RNA copies detection, whereas 92 °C-15 min drastically reduced the limit of detection, which suggests that this protocol should be avoided for inactivation ahead of molecular diagnostics. Lastly, 56 °C-30 min treatment of serum specimens had a negligible influence on the results of IgG detection using a commercial ELISA test, whereas a drastic decrease in neutralizing titers was observed.","Pastorino, Boris; Touret, Franck; Gilles, Magali; de Lamballerie, Xavier; Charrel, Remi N.",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v12070735; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32646015/,217

In this way some patients have been treated successfully. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and describe the clinical changes after IV administration of allogeneic human umbilical cord MSC (ahUCMSC), in patients with bilateral pneumonia caused by COVID-19, complicated with severe ARDS, as compassionate treatment. This was a pilot, open-label, prospective, longitudinal study. Five patients that did not improve in their clinical conditions after 48 hours of receiving the standard medical management used by the Medical Center and with persistent PaO2/FiO2 less than 100 mmHg were enrolled. ahUCMSC were infused IV, at dose of 1x10(6) per Kg of body weight over 15 minutes. Patients were monitored after the infusion to detect adverse event. Pa02/FiO2, vital signs, D-dimer, C reactive protein and total lymphocytes were monitored for 21 days after the infusion or until the patient was discharged from the hospital. Descriptive statistics were used with means or medians and standard deviation or interquartile range according to the type of variable. The Wilcoxon’s rank-sum was used for stationary samples. Adverse events occurred in three patients and were easily and quickly controlled. Immediately after the infusion of ahUCMSC, constant rise of PaO2/FiO2 was observed in all patients during the first 7 days, with statistical significance. Three patients survived and were extubated on the ninth day post-infusion. Two patients died at 13 and 15 days after infusion. The infusion of ahUCMSC in patients with severe ARDS caused by COVID-19, was safe, and demonstrated its anti-inflammatory capacity in the lungs, by improving the respiratory function expressed by PaO2 / FiO2, which allowed the survival of 3 patients, with extubation at 9 days.","Iglesias, Martin; Butrón, Patricia; Torre-Villalvazo, Iván; Torre-Anaya, Erik A; Sierra-Madero, Juan; Rodriguez-Andoney, José J; Tovar-Palacio, Armando R; Zentella-Dehesa, Alejandro; Domínguez-Cherit, Guillermo; Rodriguez-Reyna, Tatiana S; Granados-Arriola, Julio; Espisosa-Cruz, Verónica; Téllez-Pallares, Fernando P; Lozada-Estrada, Alexia; Zepeda Carrillo, Carol A; Vázquez-Mézquita, Aldo J; Nario-Chaidez, Hector F",Aging Dis,https://doi.org/10.14336/ad.2020.1218; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33815870/,217

Together, these findings better define the optimal window for donating convalescent plasma useful for immunotherapy of COVID-19 patients and reveal important predictors of an ideal plasma donor, including age and COVID-19 disease severity score. One Sentence SummaryEvaluation of SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike protein IgM, IgG, and live-virus neutralizing titer profiles reveals that the optimal window for donating convalescent plasma for use in immunotherapy is within the first 60 days of symptom onset.","Gontu, Abhinay; Srinivasan, Sreenidhi; Salazar, Eric; Nair, Meera Surendran; Nissly, Ruth H.; Greenawalt, Denver; Bird, Ian M.; Herzog, Catherine; Ferrari, Matthew J.; Poojary, Indira; Katani, Robab; Lindner, Scott E.; Minns, Allen M.; Rossi, Randall; Christensen, Paul A.; Castillo, Brian; Chen, Jian; Eagar, Todd N.; Yi, Xin; Zhao, Picheng; Leveque, Christopher; Olsen, Randall J.; Bernard, David W.; Gollihar, Jimmy; Musser, James M.; Kapur, Vivek; Kuchipudi, Suresh V.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.21.261909,217

DESIGN: Descriptive study. SETTING: Participants were included after taking part in an online quality improvement COVID-19 course for Norwegian GPs in April 2020. The participants reported whether internal and external measures were in place: COVID-19 sign on entrance, updated home page, access to video consultations and/or electronic written consultations, home office solutions, separate working teams, preparedness for home visits, isolation rooms, knowledge on decontamination, access to sufficient supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) and COVID-19 clinics. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred GP offices were included. The mean number of general practitioners per office was 5.63. RESULTS: More than 80% of practices had the following preparedness measures: COVID-19 sign on entrance, updated home page, COVID-19 clinic in the municipality, video and written electronic consultations, knowledge on how to use PPE, and home office solutions for general practitioners. Less than 50% had both PPE and knowledge of decontamination. Lack of PPE was reported by 37%, and 34% reported neither sufficient PPE nor a dedicated COVID-19 clinic. 15% reported that they had an isolation room, but not enough PPE. There were no geographical differences. CONCLUSIONS: Norwegian GPs in this study implemented many quality improvements to adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, the largest potentials for improvement seem to be securing sufficient supply of PPE and establishing an isolation room at their practices.","Alsnes, Ingvild Vatten; Munkvik, Morten; Flanders, W Dana; Øyane, Nicolas",Fam Med Community Health,https://doi.org/10.1136/fmch-2020-000512; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33277356/,217

Sample and fuzzy entropy have been used to characterize EHG signals, although they require optimizing many internal parameters. Both bubble entropy, which only requires one internal parameter, and dispersion entropy, which can detect any changes in frequency and amplitude, have been proposed to characterize biomedical signals. In this work, we attempted to determine the clinical value of these entropy measures for predicting preterm birth by analyzing their discriminatory capacity as an individual feature and their complementarity to other EHG characteristics by developing six prediction models using obstetrical data, linear and non-linear EHG features, and linear discriminant analysis using a genetic algorithm to select the features. Both dispersion and bubble entropy better discriminated between the preterm and term groups than sample, spectral, and fuzzy entropy. Entropy metrics provided complementary information to linear features, and indeed, the improvement in model performance by including other non-linear features was negligible. The best model performance obtained an F1-score of 90.1 ± 2% for testing the dataset. This model can easily be adapted to real-time applications, thereby contributing to the transferability of the EHG technique to clinical practice.","Nieto-Del-Amor, Félix; Beskhani, Raja; Ye-Lin, Yiyao; Garcia-Casado, Javier; Diaz-Martinez, Alba; Monfort-Ortiz, Rogelio; Diago-Almela, Vicente Jose; Hao, Dongmei; Prats-Boluda, Gema",Sensors,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34577278/; https://doi.org/10.3390/s21186071,217

This limitation is particularly concerning as preliminary data indicate that veterans may experience a higher rate of mortality compared to their civilian counterparts. One factor that may contribute to increased rates of death among veterans with COVID-19 is tobacco use. Indeed, findings from a recent meta-analysis highlight the association between lifetime smoking status and COVID-19 progression to more severe or critical conditions including death. Notably, prevalence rates of tobacco use are higher among veterans than civilians. Thus, the purpose of the current study was to examine demographic and medical variables that may contribute to likelihood of death among veterans testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, we examined the unique influence of lifetime tobacco use on veteran mortality when added to the complete model. Retrospective chart reviews were conducted on 440 veterans (80.5% African American/Black) who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (7.3% deceased) at a large, southeastern Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital between March 11, 2020 and April 23, 2020, with data analysis occurring from May 26, 2020 to June 5, 2020. Older age, male gender, immunodeficiency, endocrine, and pulmonary diseases were positively related to the relative risk of death among SARS-CoV-2 positive veterans, with lifetime tobacco use predicting veteran mortality above and beyond these variables. Findings highlight the importance of assessing for lifetime tobacco use among SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and the relative importance of lifetime tobacco use as a risk factor for increased mortality.","Raines, Amanda M.; Tock, Jamie L.; McGrew, Shelby J.; Ennis, Chelsea R.; Derania, Jessa; Jardak, Christina L.; Lim, Jennifer H.; Boffa, Joseph W.; Houtsma, Claire; Jones, Kenneth R.; Martin-Klinger, Caitlin; Widmer, Kyle; Schapira, Ralph; Zvolensky, Michael J.; Hoerger, Michael; Constans, Joseph I.; Franklin, C.

The increasing global health and economic burden of SARS‐CoV‐2 has necessitated urgent investigations into the pathogenesis of disease and development of therapeutic and vaccination regimens. Human trials of vaccine and antiviral candidates have been undertaken, but basic pathogenetic studies are still required to inform these trials. Gaps in understanding of cellular infection by, and immunity to, SARS‐CoV‐2 mean additional models are required to assist in improved design of these therapeutics. Human organoids are three‐dimensional models that contain multiple cell types and mimic human organs in ex vivo culture conditions. The SARS‐CoV‐2 virus has been implicated in causing not only respiratory injury but also injury to other organs such as the brain, liver and kidneys. Consequently, a variety of different organoid models have been employed to investigate the pathogenic mechanisms of disease due to SARS‐CoV‐2. Data on these models have not been systematically assembled. In this review, we highlight key findings from studies that have utilised different human organoid types to investigate the expression of SARS‐CoV‐2 receptors, permissiveness, immune response, dysregulation of cellular functions, and potential antiviral therapeutics.","Egilmezer, Ece; Rawlinson, William D",Rev Med Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33763936/; https://doi.org/10.1002/rmv.2227,217

Methods: We have comprehensively analyzed 25 different formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues/organs from autopsies of fatal COVID-19 cases (n=8), using detailed histopathological assessment, detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using polymerase chain reaction and RNA in situ hybridization, viral protein using immunohistochemistry, and virus particles using transmission electron microscopy. Finally, we confirmed these findings in an independent external autopsy cohort (n=9). Findings: SARS-CoV-2 RNA was mainly localized in epithelial cells, endothelial and mesenchymal cells across all organs. Next to lung, trachea, kidney, heart, or liver, viral RNA was also found in tonsils, salivary glands, oropharynx, thyroid, adrenal gland, testicles, prostate, ovaries, small bowel, lymph nodes, skin and skeletal muscle. Viral RNA was predominantly found in cells expressing ACE2, TMPRSS2, or both. The SARS-CoV-2 replicating RNA was also detected in these organs. Immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy were not suitable for reliable and specific SARS-CoV-2 detection in autopsies. The findings were validated using in situ hybridization on external COVID-19 autopsy samples. Finally, apart from the lung, correlation of virus detection and histopathological assessment did not reveal any specific alterations that could be attributed to SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 could be observed in virtually all organs, colocalizing with ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mainly in epithelial but also in mesenchymal and endothelial cells, and viral replication was found across all organ systems. Apart from the respiratory tract, no specific (histo-)morphologic alterations could be assigned to the SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Wong, D. W. L.; Klinkhammer, B. M.; Djudjaj, S.; Villwock, S.; Timm, M.

Since many years, animal models and highly proliferative transformed cell lines are successfully used for disease modelling, drug discovery, target validation, and preclinical testing. Still, species-specific differences regarding genetics and physiology and the limited suitability of immortalized cell lines to draw conclusions on normal human cells or specific cell types, are undeniable shortcomings. The progress in human pluripotent stem cell research now allows the growth of a virtually limitless supply of normal and DNA-edited human cells, which can be differentiated into various specific cell types. However, cells in the human body never fulfill their functions in mono-lineage isolation and diseases always develop in complex multicellular ecosystems. The recent advances in stem cell-based 3D organoid technologies allow a more accurate in vitro recapitulation of human pathologies. Embryoids are a specific type of such multicellular structures that do not only mimic a single organ or tissue, but the entire human conceptus or at least relevant components of it.

Access to brain injury rehabilitation services for Aboriginal people is reported to be often limited, with very little support outside the hospital environment. Our research involving Aboriginal brain injury survivors and their families to date has revealed that people often manage ‘on their own’ following such events. Following recommendations from survivors and their families, the Healing Right Way clinical trial, currently underway in Western Australia, has created the role of Aboriginal Brain Injury Coordinator (ABIC) to assist in navigating information and services, particularly after discharge from hospital. Eight positions for this role have been instigated across metropolitan and rural regions in the state. Healing Right Way’s aim is to enhance rehabilitation services and improve quality of life for Aboriginal Australians after brain injury. The ABIC’s role is to provide education, support, liaison and advocacy services to participants and their families over a six-month period, commencing soon after the participant’s stroke or injury has occurred. This paper outlines the development of this role, the partnerships involved, experiences to date and identifies some facilitators and barriers encountered that may impact the role’s ongoing sustainability. Details of components of the planned full Process Evaluation of Healing Right Way related to the ABIC role and the partnerships surrounding it are also provided.

AIM: To describe the epidemiology of delirium in patients hospitalized for suspect COVID-19 pneumonia during the pandemic peak in an academic hospital of Northern Italy, identify its clinical correlations and evaluate the association with mortality. METHODS: The clinical records of 852 patients admitted for suspect COVID-19 pneumonia, defined as respiratory symptoms or fever or certain history of contact with COVID-19 patients, plus chest CT imaging compatible with alveolar-interstitial pneumonia, were retrospectively analyzed. Delirium was defined after careful revision of daily clinical reports in accordance with the Confusion Assessment Method criteria. Data on age, clinical presentation, comorbidities, drugs, baseline lab tests and outcome were collected. The factors associated with delirium, and the association of delirium with mortality, were evaluated through binary logistic regression models. RESULTS: Ninety-four patients (11%) developed delirium during stay. They were older (median age 82, interquartile range, IQR 78–89, vs 75, IQR 63–84, p < 0.001), had more neuropsychiatric comorbidities and worse respiratory exchanges at baseline. At multivariate models, delirium was independently and positively associated with age [odds ratio (OR) 1.093, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.046–1.143, p < 0.001], use of antipsychotic drugs (OR 4.529, 95% CI 1.204–17.027, p = 0.025), serum urea and lactate-dehydrogenase at admission. Despite a higher mortality in patients with delirium (57% vs 30%), this association was not independent of age and respiratory parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Delirium represents a common complication of COVID-19 and a marker of severe disease course, especially in older patients with neuropsychiatric comorbidity.","Ticinesi, Andrea; Cerundolo, Nicoletta; Parise, Alberto; Nouvenne, Antonio; Prati, Beatrice; Guerra, Angela; Lauretani, Fulvio; Maggio, Marcello; Meschi, Tiziana",Aging Clin Exp Res,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40520-020-01699-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32946031/,217

672920,The Stanford Hall consensus statement for post-COVID-19 rehabilitation,2020-05-31,"BACKGROUND: Modifiable risky health behaviors, such as tobacco use, excessive alcohol use, being overweight, lack of physical activity, and unhealthy eating habits, are some of the major factors for developing chronic health conditions. Social media platforms have become indispensable means of communication in the digital era. They provide an opportunity for individuals to express themselves, as well as share their health-related concerns with peers and health care providers, with respect to risky behaviors. Such peer interactions can be utilized as valuable data sources to better understand inter-and intrapersonal psychosocial mediators and the mechanisms of social influence that drive behavior change. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review is to summarize computational and quantitative techniques facilitating the analysis of data generated through peer interactions pertaining to risky health behaviors on social media platforms. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of the literature in September 2020 by searching three databases—PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus—using relevant keywords, such as “social media,” “online health communities,” “machine learning,” “data mining,” etc. The reporting of the studies was directed by the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Two reviewers independently assessed the eligibility of studies based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. We extracted the required information from the selected studies. RESULTS: The initial search returned a total of 1554 studies, and after careful analysis of titles, abstracts, and full texts, a total of 64 studies were included in this review. We extracted the following key characteristics from all of the studies: social media platform used for conducting the study, risky health behavior studied, the number of posts analyzed, study focus, key methodological functions and tools used for data analysis, evaluation metrics used, and summary of the key findings. The most commonly used social media platform was Twitter, followed by Facebook, QuitNet, and Reddit. The most commonly studied risky health behavior was nicotine use, followed by drug or substance abuse and alcohol use. Various supervised and unsupervised machine learning approaches were used for analyzing textual data generated from online peer interactions. Few studies utilized deep learning methods for analyzing textual data as well as image or video data. Social network analysis was also performed, as reported in some studies. CONCLUSIONS: Our review consolidates the methodological underpinnings for analyzing risky health behaviors and has enhanced our understanding of how social media can be leveraged for nuanced behavioral modeling and representation. The knowledge gained from our review can serve as a foundational component for the development of persuasive health communication and effective behavior modification technologies aimed at the individual and population levels.","Singh, Tavleen; Roberts, Kirk; Cohen, Trevor; Cobb, Nathan; Wang, Jing; Fujimoto, Kayo; Myneni, Sahiti",JMIR Public Health Surveill,https://doi.org/10.2196/21660; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33252345/,217

Despite the emergency situation, all efforts have been done to preserve liver transplant (LT) activity and to minimize the impact of current scenario on transplant waiting list time and mortality. Little is known about COVID‐19 consequences in transplant candidates, especially those with limited life expectancy due to the severity of their baseline disease. We report here the case of a young patient requiring inpatient care due to severe decompensated liver disease (MELD 24), justifying her referral from her local hospital to our high‐volume LT unit, despite the unfavourable COVID‐19 epidemiology in our Region. She was quickly listed for liver transplant (MELD 26), but 5 days later she was incidentally diagnosed with COVID‐19 in the setting of our surveillance program for very sick patients and, despite her underlying condition, had an indolent course of the viral disease. Concerns about potential COVID‐19 consequences in a LT candidate were overruled by the severity of liver disease (MELD 36), forcing our team to proceed with an urgent successful LT as soon as 9 days after the COVID‐19 diagnosis, 2 days after the first negative SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA by a nasopharyngeal swab and 1 day after the confirmation of its negativity on bronchoalveolar lavage. The patient was discharged on day 9 after LT. In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a LT candidate recovering from a mild form of COVID19 and undergoing a successful LT shortly after. Aggressive care should be maintained in SARS‐CoV‐2‐positive patients with decompensated cirrhosis in order to overcome viral infection and to proceed as soon as possible with life‐saving treatment.","Martini, Silvia; Patrono, Damiano; Pittaluga, Fabrizia; Brunetto, Maurizia Rossana; Lupo, Francesco; Amoroso, Antonio; Cavallo, Rossana; Balagna, Roberto; Romagnoli, Renato",Hepatol Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32838105/; https://doi.org/10.1002/hep4.1580,217

It is believed that under-reporting is a relevant factor in determining the actual mortality rate and, if not considered, can cause significant misinformation. Therefore, this work aims to estimate the under-reporting of cases and deaths of COVID-19 in Brazilian states using data from the InfoGripe. InfoGripe targets notifications of Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI). The methodology is based on the combination of data analytics (event detection methods) and time series modeling (inertia and novelty concepts) over hospitalized SARI cases. The estimate of real cases of the disease, called novelty, is calculated by comparing the difference in SARI cases in 2020 (after COVID-19) with the total expected cases in recent years (2016–2019). The expected cases are derived from a seasonal exponential moving average. The results show that under-reporting rates vary significantly between states and that there are no general patterns for states in the same region in Brazil. The states of Minas Gerais and Mato Grosso have the highest rates of under-reporting of cases. The rate of under-reporting of deaths is high in the Rio Grande do Sul and the Minas Gerais. This work can be highlighted for the combination of data analytics and time series modeling. Our calculation of under-reporting rates based on SARI is conservative and better characterized by deaths than for cases.","Paixão, Balthazar; Baroni, Lais; Pedroso, Marcel; Salles, Rebecca; Escobar, Luciana; de Sousa, Carlos; de Freitas Saldanha, Raphael; Soares, Jorge; Coutinho, Rafaelli; Porto, Fabio; Ogasawara, Eduardo",New Gener Comput,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00354-021-00125-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33746335/,217

Gelatin from skin pretreated with 0.75 and 0.5 M-NaOH for 42 h showed the highest yield (22.60%) and gel strength (365.5 g), respectively. Structural characterization by Fourier transformation infrared spectra, X-ray diffraction, and nuclear magnetic resonance indicated that all gelatins possessed major peaks in the amide region, and diffraction peaks around 22° were basically amorphous. The temperatures for gelling and melting ranged from 20.9 °C to 25.8 °C and 27.34 °C to 30.49 °C. Microstructure revealed loose network with more voids in gelatin from skin pretreated with 0.5 and 0.75 M-NaOH for 6 h, while a highly cross-linked network and less voids were observed in those pretreated with 0.75 M-NaOH for 24 h and 0.5 M-NaOH for 42 h.

Scanner performance should be assessed regularly, including daily, weekly, and yearly evaluations to ensure high-quality and artifact-free images. Of these assessments, the daily quality assurance monitors the image quality of the scanner using a manufacturer-provided protocol. In this study, we sought to determine the factors that introduced variability in daily quality assurance data. A phantom was scanned using a head coil in two schemes: with varied phantom placement daily, and with a single phantom placement, and evaluated over approximately 1 month. Minor placement and localization changes accounted for approximately 50% of the variability in the signal-to-noise ratios observed in these measures, driven by changes in the measured signal, while the noise remained constant. The changes in the signal-to-noise ratios were small over the 2-month study period.","Owusu, Nana; Magnotta, Vincent A.",Radiol Phys Technol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12194-021-00638-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34623608/,217

One consequence of this has been a reduction in the number of sputa/cough swabs that patients submit for routine analysis. This report examines why it is important to maintain optimal sputum microbiology and explores (i). the microbiological efficiency of postal submission of sputum specimens from the community and (ii) the regulatory conditions that must be met through postal submission of respiratory specimens. Virtual clinics have now been established within CF care and it is incumbent on each speciality within the CF MDT to explore ways to nurture and support their individual contribution to the success of the virtual clinic. Within microbiology, adopting innovative approaches to sputum collection in the community and transportation via postal services will allow for continued microbiological vigilance thereby supporting patient safety.","Moore, John E.; Millar, B.

676134,Leveraging an electronic health record note template to standardize screening and testing for COVID-19,2020-07-22,"COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 is sweeping the world and posing serious health problems. Rapid and accurate detection along with timely isolation is the key to control the epidemic. Nucleic acid test and antibody-detection have been applied in the diagnosis of COVID-19, while both have their limitations. Comparatively, direct detection of viral antigens in clinical specimens is highly valuable for the early diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. The nucleocapsid (N) protein is one of the predominantly expressed proteins with high immunogenicity during the early stages of infection. Here, we applied multiple bioinformatics servers to forecast the potential immunodominant regions derived from the N protein of SARS-CoV-2. Since the high homology of N protein between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, we attempted to leverage existing SARS-CoV immunological studies to develop SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic antibodies. Finally, N(229-269), N(349-399), and N(405-419) were predicted to be the potential immunodominant regions, which contain both predicted linear B-cell epitopes and murine MHC class II binding epitopes. These three regions exhibited good surface accessibility and hydrophilicity. All were forecasted to be non-allergen and non-toxic. The final construct was built based on the bioinformatics analysis, which could help to develop an antigen-capture system for the early diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2.","Dai, Yufeng; Chen, Hongzhi; Zhuang, Siqi; Feng, Xiaojing; Fang, Yiyuan; Tang, Haoneng; Dai, Ruchun; Tang, Lingli; Liu, Jun; Ma, Tianmin; Zhong, Guangming",Pathogens and global health,https://doi.org/10.1080/20477724.2020.1838190; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33198594/,217

Objective: Estimation of (1) the proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission of COVID-19 that can occur and (2) timing of transmission relative to symptom onset. Design: Secondary analysis of published data Data sources: Meta-analysis of COVID-19 incubation period and a rapid systematic review of serial interval and generation time, which are published separately. Methods: Simulations were generated of incubation period and of serial interval or generation time. From these, transmission times relative to symptom onset were calculated and the proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission was estimated. Results: A total of 23 estimates of serial interval and five estimates of generation time from 17 publications were included. These came from nine different data source categories (presented here in descending order of the proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission): Hong Kong, Tianjin, pooled data from Hong Kong and Shenzhen, Singapore, Mainland China excluding Hubei, mixed sources, Shenzhen, northern Italy and Wuhan. Transmission time relative to symptom onset ranged from a mean of 2.05 days before symptom onset for Hong Kong to 1.72 days after symptom onset for Wuhan. Proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission ranged from 33.7% in Wuhan to 72.7% in Hong Kong. Based on individual estimates, transmission time relative to symptom onset ranged from mean of 2.95 days before symptom onset to 1.72 days after symptom onset and proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission ranged from 33.7% to 79.9%. Simple unweighted pooling of estimates based on serial intervals resulted in a mean time of transmission of 0.67 days before symptoms, and an estimated 56.1% of transmission occurring in the pre-symptomatic period. Conclusions: Contact rates between symptomatic infectious and susceptible people are likely to influence the proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission. There is substantial potential for pre-symptomatic transmission of COVID-19 in a range of different contexts. Our work suggests that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is most likely in the day before symptom onset whereas estimates suggesting most pre-symptomatic transmission highlighted a mean transmission times almost 3 days before symptom onset. These findings highlight the urgent need for extremely rapid and effective case detection, contact tracing and quarantine measures if strict social distancing measures are to be eased.","Casey, M.; Griffin, J.; McAloon, C.

676299,A company doctor's role during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020-04-30,"BACKGROUND: Influenza vaccination prevents people from influenza-related diseases and thereby mitigates the burden on national health systems when COVID-19 circulates and public health measures controlling respiratory viral infections are relaxed. However, it is challenging to maintain influenza vaccine services as the COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to disrupt vaccination programmes in many countries during the 2020/21 winter. We summarise available recommendations and strategies on influenza vaccination, specifically the changes in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We searched websites and databases of national and international public health agencies (focusing on Europe, North and South America, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa). We also contacted key influenza immunization focal points and experts in respective countries and organizations including WHO and ECDC. RESULTS: Available global and regional guidance emphasises the control of COVID-19 infection in immunisation settings by implementing multiple measures, such as physical distancing, hand hygiene practice, appropriate use of personal protective equipment by health care workers and establishing separate vaccination sessions for medically vulnerable people. The guidance also emphasises using alternative models or settings (eg, outdoor areas and pharmacies) for vaccine delivery, communication strategies and developing registry and catch-up programmes to achieve high coverage. Several novel national strategies have been adopted, such as combining influenza vaccination with other medical visits and setting up outdoor and drive through vaccination clinics. Several Southern Hemisphere countries have increased influenza vaccine coverage substantially for the 2020 influenza season. Most of the countries included in our review have planned a universal or near universal influenza vaccination for health care workers, or have made influenza vaccination for health care workers mandatory. Australia has requested that all workers and visitors in long term care facilities receive influenza vaccine. The UK has planned to expand the influenza programme to provide free influenza vaccine for the first time to all adults 50-64 years of age, people on the shielded patient list and their household members and children in the first year of secondary school. South Africa has additionally prioritised people with hypertension for influenza vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: This review of influenza vaccination guidance and strategies should support strategy development on influenza vaccination in the context of COVID-19.","Wang, Xin; Kulkarni, Durga; Dozier, Marshall; Hartnup, Karen; Paget, John; Campbell, Harry; Nair, Harish",Journal of global health,https://doi.org/10.7189/jogh.10.021102; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33312512/,217

This study aimed to quantify the variation in individual test-day milk yield and somatic cell count, risk of reproductive failure after first service of dairy cows, and risk of death of calves and heifers according to the BCV and BRSV status of the herd. Three types of status were defined for BCV and BRSV infections, based on 1) the dynamics over a 7-mo period of BCV- and BRSV-specific antibody levels in pooled milk of primiparous cows; 2) the possible occurrence of presumably BCV- and BRSV-related clinical outbreaks; and 3) the combination of both pieces of information. A total of 36,184 test days, 2,716 cows with a first service, and 4,104 calves and heifers in 65 Swedish herds were included in the analyses. Animal performance associated with BCV and BRSV infections was quantified using hierarchical mixed generalized and survival models, after adjustment for covariates known to influence the performance under study. A significant reduction in milk yield was observed for cows in presumably BRSV recently infected herds, as well as in herds having a presumably BRSV-related clinical outbreak (of 0.57 and 0.91 kg/d, respectively), compared with cows in presumably infection-free herds. There was also a significant increase in somatic cell count (of 12,000 cells/mL) for cows located in herds with a BRSV outbreak. The risk of failure after first service, as well as the risk of death in calf and heifer, was numerically higher in BRSV-infected herds, although this was not statistically significant. In contrast, BCV infection herd status, as defined in the present study, was not significantly associated with any production losses in animals from infected herds compared with those in infection-free herds.","Beaudeau, F.; Ohlson, A.; Emanuelson, U.",J Dairy Sci,https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2009-2511; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20338429/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022030210001256; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022030210001256,217

SIR (susceptible-infected-removed) models are useful in this regard but are limited by the challenge of deciding how and when to update the numerous parameters as the epidemic changes in response to population behaviors. Behaviors of particular interest include facemasks adoption (at various levels) and social distancing. We present a method that uses a “dynamic spread function” to systematically capture the continuous variation in the population behavior and the gradual change in infection evolution, resulting from interventions. No parameter updates are made by the user. We use the tool to quantify the reduction in infection rate realizable from the population of New York City adopting different facemask strategies during COVID-19. Assuming a baseline facemask of 67% filtration efficiency, calculations show that increasing the efficiency to 80% could have reduced the roughly 5000 new infections per day occurring at the peak of the epidemic to around 4000. Population behavior that may not be varied as part of the retrospective analysis, such as social distancing in a facemask analysis, are automatically captured as part of the calibration of the dynamic spread function.","Osborn, Jenna; Berman, Shayna; Bender-Bier, Sara; D’Souza, Gavin; Myers, Matthew",Math Biosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34547363/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025556421001279?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mbs.2021.108712; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0025556421001279,217

Using pneumococcal vaccination, which is recommend in anti-CD20–treated multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, as a model, we assessed vaccination behavior in patients with MS to prepare for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 vaccination challenge. METHODS: By a medical chart review, we retrospectively identified patients with MS treated with ocrelizumab at the University Hospital Bern in 2018–2020. Pneumococcal vaccination was discussed with the patients during clinical visits and highlighted in the after-visit summary addressed to the general practitioner before ocrelizumab initiation as part of our clinical standard of care. RESULTS: Pneumococcal vaccination was performed in 71/121 (58.7%) of patients, and 50/121 (41.3%) patients were not vaccinated. Patients who did not get a pneumococcal vaccination were younger (no vaccination vs vaccination; mean [95% CI] 40.1 [36.1–44.1] vs 45.4 [41.9–48.8], p = 0.028) and had more frequently a relapsing remitting disease course (no vaccination vs vaccination, n [%]; 43/50 [86.0%] vs 49/71 [69.0%], p = 0.031). Furthermore, patients who did not get vaccination had more frequently a history of comorbid psychiatric disorder (no vaccination vs vaccination, n (%); 12/50 [24.0] vs 7/71 [9.8], p = 0.035). CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that in our single-center cohort, 41.3% of patients with MS do not get the recommended pneumococcal vaccination.

678808,Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Oncologists: Results of an International Study,2021-02-11,"Priming and activation of CD8(+) T cell responses is crucial to achieve anti-viral and anti-tumor immunity. Live attenuated measles vaccine strains have been used successfully for immunization for decades and are currently investigated in trials of oncolytic virotherapy. The available reverse genetics systems allow for insertion of additional genes, including heterologous antigens. Here, we designed recombinant measles vaccine vectors for priming and activation of antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells. For proof-of-concept, we used cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) lines specific for the melanoma-associated differentiation antigen tyrosinase-related protein-2 (TRP-2), or the model antigen chicken ovalbumin (OVA), respectively. We generated recombinant measles vaccine vectors with TRP-2 and OVA epitope cassette variants for expression of the full-length antigen or the respective immunodominant CD8(+) epitope, with additional variants mediating secretion or proteasomal degradation of the epitope. We show that these recombinant measles virus vectors mediate varying levels of MHC class I (MHC-I)-restricted epitope presentation, leading to activation of cognate CTLs, as indicated by secretion of interferon-gamma (IFNγ) in vitro. Importantly, the recombinant OVA vaccines also mediate priming of naïve OT-I CD8(+) T cells by dendritic cells. While all vaccine variants can prime and activate cognate T cells, IFNγ release was enhanced using a secreted epitope variant and a variant with epitope strings targeted to the proteasome. The principles presented in this study will facilitate the design of recombinant vaccines to elicit CD8(+) responses against pathogens and tumor antigens.","Busch, Elena; Kubon, Kristina D.; Mayer, Johanna K.

The rapid dissemination and implementation of COVID-19 interventions is the realization of goals long pursued by the implementation science community. However, the downside of the rapid implementation is that low-quality evidence with little to no scientific vetting may be quickly integrated into clinical care, resulting in lost opportunities to advance our scientific understanding about how to manage infected patients.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of smoke from cigarettes on ACE-2 in bronchial epithelial cells. Normal bronchial epithelial cells (H292) were exposed to smoke by an air-liquid-interface (ALI) system and ACE-2 membrane protein expression was evaluated after 24 h from exposure. Our transcriptomics data analysis showed a significant selective reduction of membrane ACE-2 expression (about 25%) following smoking exposure. Interestingly, we observed a positive direct correlation between ACE-2 reduction and nicotine delivery. Furthermore, by stratifying GSE52237 as a function of ACE-2 gene expression levels, we highlighted 1,012 genes related to ACE-2 in smokers and 855 in non-smokers. Furthermore, we showed that 161 genes involved in the endocytosis process were highlighted using the online pathway tool KEGG. Finally, 11 genes were in common between the ACE-2 pathway in smokers and the genes regulated during endocytosis, while 12 genes with non-smokers. Interestingly, six in non-smokers and four genes in smokers were closely involved during the viral internalization process.

Can demographic and socioeconomic indicators explain differential mortality?,2021-04-16,"PURPOSE: To improve the three dimensional (3D) and two dimensional (2D) image correlation and differentiation of 3D endoluminal lesions in the traditional surface rendering (SR) computed tomographic endoscopy (CTE), a target gray level mapping (TGM) technique is developed and applied to computed tomographic colonography (CTC) in this study. METHODS: A study of sixty-two various endoluminal lesions from thirty patients (13 males, 17 females; age range 31–90 years) was approved by our institutional review board and evaluated retrospectively. The endoluminal lesions were segmented using gray level threshold. The marching cubes algorithm was used to detect isosurfaces in the segmented volumetric data sets. TGM allows users to interactively apply grey level mapping (GM) to region of interest (ROI) in the 3D CTC. Radiologists conducted the clinical evaluation and the resulting data were analyzed. RESULTS: TGM and GM are significantly superior to SR in terms of surface texture, 3D shape, the confidence of 3D to 2D, 2D to 3D image correlation, and clinical classification of endoluminal lesions (P < 0.01). The specificity and diagnostic accuracy of GM and TGM methods are significantly better than those of SR (P < 0.01). Moreover, TGM performs better than GM (specificity: 75.0–85.7% vs. 53.6–64.3%; accuracy: 88.7–93.5% vs. 77.4–83.9%). TGM is a preferable display mode for further localization and differentiation of a lesion in CTC navigation. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with only the spatial shape information in traditional SR of CTC images, the 3D shapes and gray level information of endoluminal lesions can be provided by TGM simultaneously. 3D to 2D image correlations are also increased and facilitated at the same time. TGM is less affected by adjacent colon surfaces than GM. TGM serves as a better way to improve the image correlation and differentiation of endoluminal lesions.","Chen, Lih-Shyang; Hsu, Ta-Wen; Chen, Shao-Jer; Chang, Shu-Han; Lin, Chih-Wen; Chen, Yu-Ruei; Hsieh, Chin-Chiang; Han, Shu-Chen; Chang, Ku-Yaw; Hou, Chun-Ju",J Med Biol Eng,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33013258/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40846-020-00565-0,217

We evaluated the acceptability, feasibility, and added value of integrating teleIHM with synchronous telemedicine video visits (VVs) and asynchronous video/photo sharing (V/P) during the interstage period. We conducted a descriptive program evaluation of patient-families receiving integrated multimodality telemedicine (teleIHM + VV + V/P) interstage care from 7/15/2018 to 05/15/2020. First, provider focus groups were conducted to develop a program logic model. Second, patient characteristics and clinical course were reviewed and analyzed with univariate statistics. Third, semi-structured qualitative interviews of family caregivers’ experiences were assessed using applied thematic analysis. Within the study period, 41 patients received teleIHM + VV + V/P care, of which 6 were still interstage and 4 died. About half (51%) of patients were female and 54% were a racial/ethnic minority. Median age was 42 days old (IQR 25, 58) at interstage start, with a median of 113 total days (IQR 72, 151). A total of 551 VVs were conducted with a median 12 VVs (IQR 7, 18) per patient. Parents sent a median 2 pictures (IQR 0–3, range 0–82). Qualitatively, families reported an adjustment period to teleIHM, but engaged favorably with telemedicine overall. Families felt reassured by the oversight routine telemedicine provided and identified logistical and clinical value to VVs above teleIHM alone, while acknowledging trade-offs with in-person care. Integration of multimodality telemedicine is a feasible and acceptable approach to enhance in-home care during the interstage period.","Foster, Carolyn C.; Steltzer, Michelle; Snyder, Amanda; Alden, Carrie; Helner, Khrystyna; Schinasi, Dana A.; Bohling, Katie; Allen, Kiona",Pediatr Cardiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33079264/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00246-020-02489-7,217

Results: Odds of new SARS-CoV-2 infection were reduced 65% (95% CI 60 to 70%; P<0.001) in those [≥]21 days since first vaccination with no second dose versus unvaccinated individuals without evidence of prior infection (RT-PCR or antibody). In those vaccinated, the largest reduction in odds was seen post second dose (70%, 95% CI 62 to 77%; P<0.001).There was no evidence that these benefits varied between Oxford-AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines (P>0.9).There was no evidence of a difference in odds of new SARS-CoV-2 infection for individuals having received two vaccine doses and with evidence of prior infection but not vaccinated (P=0.89). Vaccination had a greater impact on reducing SARS-CoV-2 infections with evidence of high viral shedding Ct<30 (88% reduction after two doses; 95% CI 80 to 93%; P<0.001) and with self-reported symptoms (90% reduction after two doses; 95% CI 82 to 94%; P<0.001); effects were similar for different gene positivity patterns. Conclusion: Vaccination with a single dose of Oxford-AstraZeneca or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines, or two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech, significantly reduced new SARS-CoV-2 infections in this large community surveillance study. Greater reductions in symptomatic infections and/or infections with a higher viral burden are reflected in reduced rates of hospitalisations/deaths, but highlight the potential for limited ongoing transmission from asymptomatic infections in vaccinated individuals. Registration: The study is registered with the ISRCTN Registry, ISRCTN21086382.","Pritchard, E.; Matthews, P.; Stoesser, N.; Eyre, D.; Gethings, O.; Vitha, K.-D.; Jones, J.; House, T.; VanSteenhouse, H.; Bell, I.; Bell, J.; Newton, J.; Farrar, J.; Diamond, I.; Rourke, E.; Studley, R.; Crook, D.

AIM: To define the clinical and histological, characteristics, as well as the outcome of ischemic gastrointestinal manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: A structured retrospective collection was promoted among three tertiary referral centres during the first wave of the pandemic in northern Italy. Clinical, radiological, endoscopic and histological data of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 between March 1(st) and May 30(th) were reviewed. The diagnosis was established by consecutive analysis of all abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans performed. RESULTS: Among 2929 patients, 21 (0.7%) showed gastrointestinal ischemic manifestations either as presenting symptom or during hospitalization. Abdominal CT showed bowel distention in 6 patients while signs of colitis/enteritis in 12. Three patients presented thrombosis of main abdominal veins. Endoscopy, when feasible, confirmed the diagnosis (6 patients). Surgical resection was necessary in 4/21 patients. Histological tissue examination showed distinctive features of endothelial inflammation in the small bowel and colon. Median hospital stay was 9 d with a mortality rate of 39%. CONCLUSION: Gastrointestinal ischemia represents a rare manifestation of COVID-19. A high index of suspicion should lead to investigate this complication by CT scan, in the attempt to reduce its high mortality rate. Histology shows atypical feature of ischemia with important endotheliitis, probably linked to thrombotic microangiopathies.","Norsa, Lorenzo; Bonaffini, Pietro Andrea; Caldato, Maja; Bonifacio, Cristiana; Sonzogni, Aurelio; Indriolo, Amedeo; Valle, Clarissa; Furfaro, Federica; Bonanomi, Alice; Franco, Paolo Niccolò; Gori, Mauro; Smania, Veronica; Scaramella, Lucia; Forzenigo, Laura; Vecchi, Maurizio; Solbiati, Monica; Costantino, Giorgio; Danese, Silvio; D'Antiga, Lorenzo; Sironi, Sandro; Elli, Luca",World J Gastroenterol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34539144/; https://doi.org/10.3748/wjg.v27.i32.5448,217

METHODS: An analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guideline. Prospective studies and methodology-based systematic reviews and meta-analyses of postoperative therapy for SCCHN were identified by searching Medline (OVID) and EMBASE (Elsevier) using controlled vocabulary terms (ie, National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings [MeSH], EMTREE). Study screening and selection was performed with Covidence software and full-text review. The RAND/UCLA appropriateness method was used by the expert panel to rate the appropriate use of postoperative therapy, and the modified Delphi method was used to come to consensus. RESULTS: A total of 5660 studies were identified and screened using the title and abstract, leading to 201 studies assessed for relevance using full-text review. After limitation to the eligibility criteria, 101 studies from 1977 to 2020 were identified, including 77 with oncologic endpoints and 24 with function and quality of life endpoints. All studies reported staging prior to the implementation of American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC-8). CONCLUSIONS: Prospective clinical studies and systematic reviews identified through the PRISMA systematic review provided good evidence for consensus statements regarding the appropriate use of postoperative therapy for resected SCCHN. Further research is needed in domains where consensus by the expert panel could not be achieved for the appropriateness of specific postoperative therapeutic interventions.","Margalit, Danielle N; Sacco, Assuntina G; Cooper, Jay S; Ridge, John A; Bakst, Richard L; Beadle, Beth M; Beitler, Jonathan J; Chang, Steven S; Chen, Allen M; Galloway, Tom J; Koyfman, Shlomo A; Mita, Carol; Robbins, Jared R; Tsai, C Jillian; Truong, Minh T; Yom, Sue S; Siddiqui, Farzan",Head Neck,https://doi.org/10.1002/hed.26490; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33098180/,217

The second was to determine the optimum adjuvant formulation of the inactivated PEDV vaccine that induces protection against viral challenge. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To generate high titers of infectious PEDV, the QIAP1401 isolate was passaged in Vero cells. The experimental vaccines were prepared from a binary ethyleneimine-inactivated QIAP1401 strain passaged sequentially 70 times (QIAP1401-p70), formulated with four commercial adjuvants, and administered twice intramuscularly to growing pigs. Challenge studies using a virulent homologous strain of PEDV QIAP1401-p11, which was passaged 11 times after isolation, were performed to assess protection against disease progression and viral shedding during the 15-day observation period. The vaccine-induced antibody responses were measured in serum samples collected at predetermined time points by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and virus neutralization test. RESULTS: The QIAP1401-p70 strain had 42 amino acid (aa) mutations, including a 25 aa deletion, and was selected as the inactivated PEDV vaccine candidate. Although none of the pigs that received the experimental vaccines were completely protected against subsequent viral challenge, they exhibited a significantly higher immune response than did non-vaccinated control pigs. Among the vaccine groups, the highest antibody responses were observed in the pigs that received an oil-based multiphasic water/oil/water (W/O/W) emulsion adjuvanted vaccine, which delayed the onset of clinical symptoms and viral shedding. CONCLUSION: A novel inactivated PEDV vaccine formulated with a W/O/W emulsion adjuvant was both immunogenic and protective against viral challenge.","Lee, Seung Heon; Yang, Dong-Kun; Kim, Ha-Hyun; Cho, In-Soo",Clin Exp Vaccine Res,https://doi.org/10.7774/cevr.2018.7.1.61; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29399581/,217

STUDY DESIGN: Development and validation of a tool to assess the quality of reporting of health-related articles, and assessment of the quality of these articles in British newspapers. METHODS: Eight national daily newspapers from the UK were reviewed for 20 days over a 2-month period. All articles reporting newly emerging research pertaining to health in humans were included and reviewed independently by two raters. A descriptive analysis was performed. Subsequently, a quality assessment tool for use by a non-expert was developed and validated to objectively assess the quality of a newspaper article on a health-related topic. RESULTS: The quality assessment tool was found to have good internal consistency and inter-rater reliability. The Daily Mail published almost twice as many articles as its nearest rival, The Daily Express, and over eight times as many articles as The Guardian. Articles in The Times were, on average, more than twice as long as those in The Sun and The Daily Telegraph. The highest quality articles were in The Times and The Independent, with the lowest quality articles in The Sun. The quality scores of anonymous articles were significantly lower than those attributed to named journalists. CONCLUSIONS: There are significant differences in the quality of reporting within and between major daily UK newspapers, with anonymous articles being the poorest quality, and widespread reliance on press releases from the major UK scientific journals.","Robinson, A.; Coutinho, A.; Bryden, A.; McKee, M.",Public Health,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033350612003484; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2012.10.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23219265/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0033350612003484,217

However, their high cost equates to low affordability. Total nano-vaccine purchases per capita and their proportion within the total vaccine lots have increased directly with the GDP per capita of countries. While three out of four COVID-19 vaccines procured by wealthy countries by the end of 2020 were nano-vaccines, this amounted to only one in ten for middle-income countries and nil for the low-income countries. Meanwhile, economic gains of saving lives with nano-vaccines in USA translate to large costs in middle-/low-income countries.

In this study the objectives included determining the correlation between the Abbott ID NOW point-of-care testing (POCT) instrument using the Influenza A&B2 test and the laboratory based GeneXpert Flu+RSV kit. In addition the impact of the POCT instrument on the prescription of antivirals and antibiotics was evaluated by comparing with practice when the instrument was not in place. RESULTS: The results of the correlation study with a cohort of 54 patients revealed the Abbott ID NOW POCT has 92% sensitivity for the detection of Influenza A, while specificity was 100% for both Influenza A and B. The impact of the POCT instrument on the frequency of prescription of antivirals and amount of antibiotics consumed (33% reduction in antibiotic consumption in a cohort of 65 (2017) and 61 (2018)) was significant.

682586,CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES OF FEVER DURING PREGNANCY: A RETROSPECTIVE STUDY IN A GYNAECOLOGICAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT,2020-08-24,"Abstract Operating a modern power grid reliably in case of SCADA/EMS failure or amid difficult times like COVID-19 pandemic is a challenging task for grid operators. In [11], a PMU-based emergency generation dispatch scheme has been proposed to help the system operators with the supply and demand balancing; however, its realization highly relies on the control center infrastructure for computing and communication. This work, rather than using the on-premises server and dispatch communication system, proposes and implements a cloud-centric serverless architecture to ensure the operation continuity regardless of local infrastructure’s availability and accessibility. Through its prototype implementation and evaluation at ISO New England, the solution has demonstrated two major advantages. Firstly, the cloud infrastructure is independent and fault-tolerant, providing grid monitoring and control capability even when EMS loses the corresponding functionality or when operators need to work remotely away from the control center. Secondly, the overall design is event-driven using serverless cloud services in response to the SCADA/EMS failure event. Thanks to “serverless”, the burden of the server provisioning and maintenance can be avoided from the user side. The cost of using public cloud services for this solution is extremely low since it is architected and implemented based on the event-driven Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) model. This work also develops a comprehensive cyber security mechanism to comply with critical infrastructure requirements for the power grid, which can serve as an exemplary framework for other grid operators to secure their cloud services.","Zhang, Song; Luo, Xiaochuan; Litvinov, Eugene",International Journal of Electrical Power & Energy Systems,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.13733v1.pdf; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142061520313569; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0142061520313569,217

METHODS: This was a historical cohort study of pregnant mothers with pregestational type 2 diabetes delivering at a Canadian tertiary-care center between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2018. Delivery records were reviewed to collect information about demographics and peripartum complications. Stored fetal ultrasound images from 36 weeks' gestation were reviewed to collect fetal biometry and postprocessing measurement of AWT performed in a standardized fashion by 2 blinded and independent observers. The relationship between fetal AWT was then correlated with risk of intrapartum complications including emergency Caesarean section (CS) and shoulder dystocia. RESULTS: 216 pregnant women with type 2 diabetes had planned vaginal deliveries and were eligible for inclusion. Mean maternal age was 31.3 years, and almost all were overweight or obese at the time of delivery (96.8%). Overall, the incidence of shoulder dystocia and emergency intrapartum CS was 7.4% and 17.6%, respectively. There was no difference in mean fetal AWT between those having a spontaneous vaginal delivery (8.2 mm (95% CI 7.9-8.5)) and those needing emergency intrapartum CS (8.1 mm (95% CI 7.4-8.8); p = 0.71) or shoulder dystocia (8.7 mm (95% CI 7.9-9.5); p = 0.23). There was strong interobserver correlation of AWT measurements (r = 0.838; p < 0.00001). The strongest association with intrapartum complications was birthweight (p = 0.003): with birthweight > 4000 grams, the relative risk of shoulder dystocia or CS is 2.75 (95% CI 1.74-4.36; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: There was no obvious benefit of AWT measurement at 36 weeks for predicting shoulder dystocia or intrapartum CS amongst women with type 2 diabetes in our population. The strongest predictor of intrapartum complications remained birthweight, and so studies for improving estimation of fetal weight and evaluating the role of intrapartum ultrasound for predicting risk of delivery complications are still needed.","Isabey, E.

Chronic bronchitis, pulmonary emphysema, and bronchial asthma may all be associated with airflow limitation; therefore, exacerbation of asthma may be associated with the pathophysiology of COPD. Furthermore, recent studies have suggested that the exacerbation of asthma, namely virus-induced asthma, may be associated with a wide variety of respiratory viruses. COPD and asthma have different underlying pathophysiological processes and thus require individual therapies. Exacerbation of both COPD and asthma, which are basically defined and diagnosed by clinical symptoms, is associated with a rapid decline in lung function and increased mortality. Similar pathogens, including human rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, and coronavirus, are also frequently detected during exacerbation of asthma and/or COPD. Immune response to respiratory viral infections, which may be related to the severity of exacerbation in each disease, varies in patients with both COPD and asthma. In this regard, it is crucial to recognize and understand both the similarities and differences of clinical features in patients with COPD and/or asthma associated with respiratory viral infections, especially in the exacerbative stage. In relation to definition, epidemiology, and pathophysiology, this review aims to summarize current knowledge concerning exacerbation of both COPD and asthma by focusing on the clinical significance of associated respiratory virus infections.","Kurai, Daisuke; Saraya, Takeshi; Ishii, Haruyuki; Takizawa, Hajime",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24098299/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2013.00293,217

However scores of all domains dropped markedly as a result of political conflicts as well as the onset of the pandemic. CONCLUSION: The documentation of the trend in HKEQOL shows that while it may be used as a macro indicator that is able to reflect policies affecting the well-being of older people, it is also able to reflect the impact of societal unrest and pandemics, and that the latter may override the effect of existing ageing policies. It also follows that during social unrest and pandemics, specific policies targeting older people may be needed to maintain well-being.","Woo, Jean; Leung, D.; Yu, R.; Lee, R.; Wong, H.",J Nutr Health Aging,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12603-020-1488-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33575723/,217

The Pituitary Society surveyed its membership to understand planned approaches to glucocorticoid management in patients with adrenal insufficiency who will receive a COVID-19 vaccine. METHODS: Members were asked to complete up to 3 questions regarding their planned approach for use of glucocorticoid replacement in patients with proven adrenal insufficiency. RESULTS: Surveys were sent to 273 members and 103 responded. Thirty-six percent plan to recommend that patients automatically increase glucocorticoid dosage with administration of the first vaccine injection. Of these, 84% plan to increase glucocorticoid dose on the day of vaccination, and 49% plan to increase glucocorticoid dose prior to vaccination. Of the 64% who do not plan to recommend automatic glucocorticoid dose increase with vaccine administration, 88% plan to increase the dose if the patient develops a fever, and 47% plan to increase the dose if myalgias and arthralgias occur. CONCLUSIONS: Most clinicians plan to maintain the current glucocorticoid dose with vaccine administration. The vast majority plan and to increase glucocorticoid dose in case of fever, and just under half in case of arthralgias and myalgias.

The possibility of COVID-19 airborne transmission in indoor environments is debatable. The present study examined the concentration of viral RNA-containing particles produced directly or indirectly by breathing or coughing of confirmed COVID-19 patients or by carriers without symptoms. Some studies do not accept this method of transmission (COVID-19 airborne transmission). The present study aimed to measure the possible exposure of health care personnel to SARS-CoV-2 particles that may have been suspended in the air to respond to the hypothesis of COVID-19 airborne transmission. Airborne particle sampling was performed using impingement method based on NIOSH (chapter BA) and ASHRAE. Selection of sampling sections was in line with the WHO guidelines. The samples were analyzed using RT-PCR technique. Based on the given results, airborne particles of COVID-19 may present in the air and affect the health of hospital personnel. In fact, the analysis of gene expression in ambient conditions and thereby aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through air is possible and may lead to occupational exposure of health care personnel. Furthermore, it was found that airborne emission of COVID-19 through the breathing zone of patients, particularly in ICU wards with confirmed cases of COVID-19, may be higher than in other ICU wards.

686746,Preventing a Secondary Epidemic of Lost Early Career Scientists. Effects of COVID-19 Pandemic on Women with Children,2020-11-11,"BACKGROUND: Synonymous mutations do not alter the amino acids and therefore are regarded as neutral for a long time. However, they do change the tRNA adaptation index (tAI) of a particular codon (independent of its context), affecting the tRNA availability during translation. They could also change the isoaccepting relationship with its neighboring synonymous codons in particular context, which again affects the local translation process. Evidence of selection pressure on synonymous mutations has emerged. RESULTS: The proposed selection patterns on synonymous mutations are never formally and systematically tested in plant species. We fully take advantage of the SNP data from 1,135 A. thaliana lines, and found that the synonymous mutations that increase tAI or the isoaccepting mutations in isoaccepting codon context tend to have higher derived allele frequencies (DAF) compared to other synonymous mutations of the opposite effects. CONCLUSIONS: Synonymous mutations are not strictly neutral. The synonymous mutations that increase tAI or the isoaccepting mutations in isoaccepting codon context are likely to be positively selected. We propose the concept of context-dependent and -independent selection on synonymous mutations. These concepts broaden our knowledge of the functional consequences of synonymous mutations, and should be appealing to phytologists and evolutionary biologists.","Chu, Duan; Wei, Lai",BMC Ecol Evol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33910528/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12862-021-01792-y,217

The authors document treatment fidelity and provide initial testing of telehealth intervention delivery in a new subject sample. METHODS: The authors adapted the intervention manual used in the previous trial for telehealth. Infants (6-24 months) were randomly assigned to intervention (n = 7) or waitlist (n = 6). The intervention prescribed soft-constraint wear on the less affected UE for 6 hours, 5 d/wk, and exercises. After an initial in-person training session, three 15- to 45-minute telehealth sessions were performed. RESULTS: Median weekly constraint wear was 21 hours (interquartile range = 10.3-29.7); average parent-treatment fidelity was 95.7% (SD 11.2). A significant large (Cohen d = 0.92) between-group differences occurred on fine motor functioning of more affected UEs. CONCLUSION: The telehealth intervention was feasible and potentially effective, but a larger trial is needed to evaluate efficacy.","Pietruszewski, Lindsay; Burkhardt, Stephanie; Yoder, Paul J.; Heathcock, Jill; Lewandowski, Dennis J.; Maitre, Nathalie L.",Child Neurol Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33015220/; https://doi.org/10.1177/2329048x20946214,217
686993,Decline in cancer pathology notifications during the 2020 COVID‐19‐related restrictions in Victoria,2021-02-24,"Neurological disorders comprise 20% of hospital admissions in Cameroon. The burden of neurological disorders is increasing, especially in children and the elderly. However, there are very few neurologists, psychiatrists, gerontologists and neuropsychologists trained in the treatment of neurological disorders in Cameroon and there are very few facilities for training in basic and clinical neuroscience. Although non-governmental organizations such as the International Brain Research Organization (IBRO), International Society of Neurochemistry (ISN), and Teaching and Research in Natural Sciences for Development (TReND) in Africa have stepped in to provide short training courses and workshops in neuroscience, these are neither sufficient to train African neuroscientists nor to build the capacity to train neuroscience researchers and clinicians. There has also been little support from universities and the government for such training. While some participants of these schools have managed to form collaborations with foreign researchers and have been invited to study abroad, this does not facilitate the training of neuroscientists in Cameroon. Moreover, the research infrastructure for training in neuroscience remains limited. This is reflected in the low research output from Cameroonian universities in the field. In this review, we describe the burden of neurological disorders in Cameroon and outline the outstanding efforts of local scientists to develop the discipline of neuroscience, which is still an emerging field in Cameroon. We identify key actionable steps towards the improvement of the scientific capacity in neuroscience in Cameroon: (1) develop targeted neuroscience training programs in all major universities in Cameroon; (2) implement a thriving scientific environment supported by international collaborations; (3) focus on the leadership and the mentorship of both local and senior neuroscientists; (4) develop public awareness and information of policy makers to increase governmental funding for neuroscience research.","Mbiydzenyuy, Ngala Elvis; Pieme, Constant Anatole; Brown, Richard E.; Nguemeni, Carine",IBRO Neurosci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibneur.2021.02.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34179870/,217
688537,The COVID-19 pandemic and face shields,2020-07-31,"RNA homodimerization is important for various physiological processes, including the assembly of membraneless organelles, RNA subcellular localization, and packaging of viral genomes. However, understanding of RNA homodimerization has been hampered by the lack of systematic in vivo detection methods. Here we show that PARIS, COMRADES, and other RNA proximity ligation methods can detect RNA homodimers transcriptome-wide as “overlapping” chimeric reads that contain more than one copy of the same sequence. Analysing published proximity ligation datasets, we show that RNA:RNA homodimers mediated by direct base-pairing interactions are rare across the transcriptome, but highly enriched in specific transcripts, including U8 snoRNA, U2 snRNA and a subset of tRNAs. Analysis of data from virus-infected cells reveals homodimerization of SARS-CoV-2 and Zika genomes, mediated by specific palindromic sequences located within protein-coding regions of N protein in SARS-CoV-2 and NS2A gene in Zika. We speculate that regions of viral genomes involved in homodimerization may constitute effective targets for antiviral therapies.","Gabryelska, Marta M; Kudla, Grzegorz",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.13.444021,217

Some Bangladeshi institutes are also in this race, sequenced a few isolates of the virus collected from Bangladesh. Here, we present a genomic analysis of these isolates. The analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2 isolates sequenced from Dhaka and Chittagong were the lineage of Europe and India, respectively. Our analysis identified a total of 42 mutations, including three large deletions, half of which were synonymous. Most of the missense mutations in Bangladeshi isolates found to have weak effects on the pathogenesis. Some mutations may lead the virus to be less pathogenic than the other countries. Molecular docking analysis to evaluate the effect of the mutations on the interaction between the viral spike proteins and the human ACE2 receptor, though no significant interaction was observed. This study provides some preliminary insights into the origin of Bangladeshi SARS-CoV-2 isolates, mutation spectrum and its possible pathomechanism, which may give an essential clue for designing therapeutics and management of COVID-19 in Bangladesh.","Parvez, Md.

We examine how official securitisation discourses in the two countries draw on gendered constructions of national identity and discuss what linkages and potential implications they have for the state, its policy, and its society. Our analysis shows that both the US President Donald Trump and Russia's President Vladimir Putin instrumentalise hierarchical gendered identities to securitise COVID-19. They mobilise gendered narratives, imageries, and practices to affirm particular understandings of the threat and create a homogeneous national ‘we’, portraying themselves as its guardians.","Kuteleva, Anna; Clifford, Sarah J.",European Journal of International Security,https://doi.org/10.1017/eis.2021.5,217
