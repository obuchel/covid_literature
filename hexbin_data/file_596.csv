It is argued that all of these areas could be of key importance in most protein engineering projects, because they give access to increased and often unique information. In the last part of the review some potential areas for future applications of protein engineering approaches are discussed, such as non-conventional media, de novo design and nanotechnology.","Anthonsen, Henrik W.; Baptista, António; Drabløs, Finn; Martel, Paulo; Petersen, Steffen B.",J Biotechnol,596,12

However, Pmus is not commonly measured since an esophageal balloon catheter is required. We have previously shown that Pmus can be estimated by measuring the electrical activity of the diaphragm (EAdi) through the Pmus/EAdi index (PEI). We investigated whether PEI could be reliably measured by a brief end-expiratory occlusion maneuver to propose an automated PEI measurement performed by the ventilator. Pmus, EAdi, airway pressure (Paw), and flow waveforms of 12 critically ill patients undergoing assisted mechanical ventilation were recorded. Repeated end-expiratory occlusion maneuvers were performed. PEI was measured at 100 ms (PEI(0.1)) and 200 ms (PEI(0.2)) from the start of the occlusion and compared to the PEI measured at the maximum Paw deflection (PEI(occl), reference). PEI(0.1) and PEI(0.2) tightly correlated with PEI(occl), (p < 0.001, R(2) = 0.843 and 0.847). At a patient-level analysis, the highest percentage error was -64% and 50% for PEI(0.1) and PEI(0.2), respectively, suggesting that PEI(0.2) might be a more reliable measurement. After correcting the error bias, the PEI(0.2) percentage error was lower than ± 30% in all but one subjects (range − 39 to + 29%). It is possible to calculate PEI over a brief airway occlusion of 200 ms at inspiratory onset without the need for a full patient's inspiratory effort. Automated and repeated brief airway occlusions performed by the ventilator can provide a real time measurement of PEI; combining the automatically measured PEI with the EAdi trace could be used to continuously display the Pmus waveform at the bedside without the need of an esophageal balloon catheter.

In this study, we conducted a mixed methods content analysis of biodiversity plans by 39 cities around the world to determine whether they measured their actions, how they did so (via quantitative indicators and qualitative outputs), and what topics these actions and measures covered. We based our analytical framework on the Singapore Index on Cities’ Biodiversity (also known as the City Biodiversity Index), a widely applied 23-indicator index that helps cities track their progress in biodiversity planning. The Singapore Index groups its indicators into the following three core components: native biodiversity, ecosystem services, and governance and management. For actions and measures not classifiable by the Singapore Index, we inductively derived additional categories. Across all plans, we identified 2,231 actions, 346 indicators, and 444 outputs. We found that all of the plans included actions, while 82% included measures (67% included indicators and 72% included outputs). Only 29% of actions were associated with a measure. Overall, the plans covered all of the categories in the Singapore Index, particularly within the core components of native biodiversity and governance and management, though some plans had a narrower focus. The 20 additional urban biodiversity topics that were not covered by the Singapore Index framework included socioeconomic considerations, data collection, genetic diversity, urban agriculture and forestry, green infrastructure, human-wildlife conflicts, indigenous concerns, and citizen science. Indicators were the most common measures for native biodiversity and ecosystem service topics, while outputs were the most common measures for governance and management. Our results may inform the revision and development of urban biodiversity indicators in the post-2020 framework and of other initiatives that guide cities in contributing to local and global biodiversity goals.","Pierce, Jennifer Rae; Barton, Melissa A.; Tan, Mika Mei Jia; Oertel, Ginevra; Halder, Michael D.; Lopez-Guijosa, Pablo Arturo; Nuttall, Rohan",PLoS One,596,12

METHODS: This was a retrospective study conducted in 5 EDs between November 2016 and February 2017. We recorded age, sex, comorbidities, body temperature, clinical findings, and initial laboratory results, including the RDW. The initial RDW values and the qSOFA criteria were obtained at the time of the ED visit. The primary outcome was 30 day mortality. RESULTS: A total of 1,446 patients were finally included in this study, of which 134 (9.3%) died within 30 days and the median (IQR) age was 77 (72, 82) years. In the multivariable analysis, the RDW (14.0–15.4%) and highest RDW (> 15.4%) quartile were shown to be independent risk factors for 30 day mortality (OR 2.12; 95% CI 1.12–4.02; p = 0.021) (OR 3.35; 95% CI 1.83–6.13; p < 0.001). The patients with qSOFA 2 and 3 were shown to have the high odds ratios of 30-day mortality (OR 3.50; 95% CI 2.09–5.84; p < 0.001) (OR 11.30; 95% CI 5.06–25.23; p < 0.001). The qSOFA combined with the RDW quartile for the prediction of 30 day mortality showed an AUROC value of 0.710 (0.686–0.734). CONCLUSION: The qSOFA combined with the initial RDW value was associated with 30-day mortality among older adults with infections in the ED. The initial RDW may help emergency physicians predict mortality in older adults with infections visiting the ED.","Kim, Sang Yun; Woo, Seon Hee; Lee, Woon Jeong; Kim, Dae Hee; Seol, Seung Hwan; Lee, June Young; Jeong, Sikyoung; Park, Sanghyun; Cha, Kyungman; Youn, Chun Song",Aging Clin Exp Res,596,17

These diseases embody the diversity of rickettsial disease worldwide and allow us to interconnect the various contributions to this special issue of Tropical Medicine and Infectious Disease. The impact of rickettsial diseases—particularly of scrub typhus—was substantial during the wars and “police actions” of the last 80 years. However, the post-World War II arrival of effective antibiotics reduced their impact, when recognized and adequately treated (chloramphenicol and tetracyclines). Presently, however, scrub typhus appears to be emerging and spreading into regions not previously reported. Better diagnostics, or higher population mobility, change in antimicrobial policies, even global warming, have been proposed as possible culprits of this phenomenon. Further, sporadic reports of possible antibiotic resistance have received the attention of clinicians and epidemiologists, raising interest in developing and testing novel diagnostics to facilitate medical diagnosis. We present a brief history of rickettsial diseases, their relative importance within the region, focusing on the so-called “tsutsugamushi triangle”, the past and present impact of these diseases within the region, and indicate how historically, these often-confused diseases were ingeniously distinguished from each another. Moreover, we will discuss the importance of DNA-sequencing efforts for Orientia tsutsugamushi, obtained from patient blood, vector chiggers, and rodent reservoirs, particularly for the dominant 56-kD type-specific antigen gene (tsa56), and whole-genome sequences, which are increasing our knowledge of the diversity of this unique agent. We explore and discuss the potential of sequencing and other effective tools to geographically trace rickettsial disease agents, and develop control strategies to better mitigate the rickettsioses.","Paris, Daniel H.; Kelly, Daryl J.; Fuerst, Paul A.; Day, Nicholas P.

Telemedicine is effective for management of chronic conditions such as diabetes but its effectiveness in primary care settings is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate differences in diabetes care before and after implementation of a longitudinal virtual primary care program. DESIGN: Propensity score-matched cohort study utilizing difference-in-differences analysis. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with diabetes who received care at VA primary care clinics between January 2018 and December 2019 where the Virtual Integrated Multisite Patient Aligned Care Teams (V-IMPACT) program was implemented. EXPOSURE: Patient participation in at least one V-IMPACT visit while usual care patients did not participate in V-IMPACT. MAIN MEASURES: The primary outcome was change in hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) and secondary outcomes included change in the proportion of patients meeting diabetes quality indicators: blood pressure control, statin use, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ACEi/ARB) use, and annual microalbuminuria testing. KEY RESULTS: Our propensity-matched cohort included 9010 patients split evenly between those who participated in V-IMPACT and those who remained in usual in-person care. Among individuals with diabetes who participated in V-IMPACT, the change in mean HbA1C was − 0.055% (95% CI − 0.088 to − 0.022%) while those in usual care had a − 0.047% (95% CI − 0.080 to − 0.014%) change before and after program implementation. We observed a 5.1% (95% CI 2.4 to 7.7%) absolute increase in the proportion prescribed statins in the V-IMPACT group, a 5.3% (95% CI 2.5 to 8.2%) increase prescribed ACE/ARBs, and a 4.6% (95% 1.7 to 7.5%) increase in completed yearly microalbuminuria testing. V-IMPACT was not associated with a significant difference in the proportion with controlled blood pressure at < 140/90 or < 130/90 mmHg thresholds.

We evaluated the association between longitudinal outcomes and these cEEG biomarkers. We additionally evaluated the association between longitudinal outcomes and other in-hospital complications. METHODS: Patients with nontraumatic SAH undergoing ≥ 3 days of cEEG monitoring were enrolled in a prospective study evaluating longitudinal outcomes. Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) was assessed at discharge, and at 3- and 6-month follow-up time points. Adjusting for baseline severity in a cumulative proportional odds model, we modeled the mRS ordinally and measured the association between mRS and two forms of in-hospital cEEG deterioration: (1) cEEG evidence of new or worsening epileptiform abnormalities and (2) cEEG evidence of new background deterioration. We compared the magnitude of these associations at each time point with the association between mRS and other in-hospital complications: (1) delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI), (2) hospital-acquired infections (HAI), and (3) hydrocephalus. In a secondary analysis, we employed a linear mixed effects model to examine the association of mRS over time (dichotomized as 0–3 vs. 4–6) with both biomarkers of cEEG deterioration and with other in-hospital complications. RESULTS: In total, 175 mRS assessments were performed in 59 patients. New or worsening EAs developed in 23 (39%) patients, and new background deterioration developed in 24 (41%). Among cEEG biomarkers, new or worsening EAs were independently associated with mRS at discharge, 3, and 6 months, respectively (adjusted cumulative proportional odds 4.99, 95% CI 1.60–15.6; 3.28, 95% CI 1.14–9.5; and 2.71, 95% CI 0.95–7.76), but cEEG background deterioration lacked an association. Among hospital complications, DCI was associated with discharge, 3-, and 6-month outcomes (adjusted cumulative proportional odds 4.75, 95% CI 1.64–13.8; 3.4; 95% CI 1.24–9.01; and 2.45, 95% CI 0.94–6.6), but HAI and hydrocephalus lacked an association. The mixed effects model demonstrated that these associations were sustained over longitudinal assessments without an interaction with time. CONCLUSION: Although new or worsening EAs and cEEG background deterioration have both been shown to predict DCI, only new or worsening EAs are associated with a sustained impairment in functional outcome. This novel finding raises the potential for identifying therapeutic targets that may also influence outcomes.

Although various types of DC subsets, including DC type 3 (DC3s), have been identified in humans, it remains unclear whether humanized mice can reproduce heterogeneous DC subsets. CD14, classically known as a monocyte/macrophage marker, is reported as an indicator of DC3s. We previously observed that some CD14(+) myeloid cells expressed CD1c, a pan marker for bona fide conventional DC2 (cDC2s), in humanized mouse models in which human FLT3L and GM-CSF genes were transiently expressed using in vivo transfection (IVT). Here, we aimed to elucidate the identity of CD14(+)CD1c(+) DC-like cells in humanized mouse models. We found that CD14(+)CD1c(+) cells were phenotypically different from cDC2s; CD14(+)CD1c(+) cells expressed CD163 but not CD5, whereas cDC2s expressed CD5 but not CD163. Furthermore, CD14(+)CD1c(+) cells primed and polarized naïve CD4(+) T cells toward IFN-γ(+) Th1 cells more profoundly than cDC2s. Transcriptional analysis revealed that CD14(+)CD1c(+) cells expressed several DC3-specific transcripts, such as CD163, S100A8, and S100A9, and were clearly segregated from cDC2s and monocytes. When lipopolysaccharide was administered to the humanized mice, the frequency of CD14(+)CD1c(+) cells producing IL-6 and TNF-α was elevated, indicating a pro-inflammatory signature. Thus, humanized mice are able to sustain development of functional CD14(+)CD1c(+) DCs, which are equivalent to DC3 subset observed in humans, and they could be useful for analyzing the development and function of DC3s in vivo.","Iwabuchi, Ryutaro; Ide, Keigo; Terahara, Kazutaka; Wagatsuma, Ryota; Iwaki, Rieko; Matsunaga, Hiroko; Tsunetsugu-Yokota, Yasuko; Takeyama, Haruko; Takahashi, Yoshimasa",Front Immunol,596,16

Here, using different strains of the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) model system, we show that slower propagation results in limited type I interferon (IFN-I) production and viral persistence. Specifically, cells infected with LCMV-Docile exhibited reduced viral replication when compared to LCMV-WE and as a consequence, infection with LCMV-Docile resulted in reduced activation of bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) and IFN-I production in vitro in comparison with LCMV-WE. In vivo, we observed a reduction of IFN-I, T cell exhaustion and viral persistence following infection of LCMV-Docile but not LCMV-WE. Mechanistically, block of intracellular protein transport uncovered reduced propagation of LCMV-Docile when compared to LCMV-WE. This reduced propagation was critical in blunting the activation of the innate and adaptive immune system. When mice were simultaneously infected with LCMV-Docile and LCMV-WE, immune function was restored and IFN-I production, T cell effector functions as well as viral loads were similar to that of mice infected with LCMV-WE alone. Taken together, this study suggests that reduced viral propagation can result in immune evasion and viral persistence.","Xu, Haifeng C.; Wang, Ruifeng; Shinde, Prashant V.; Walotka, Lara; Huang, Anfei; Poschmann, Gereon; Huang, Jun; Liu, Wei; Stühler, Kai; Schaal, Heiner; Bergthaler, Andreas; Pandyra, Aleksandra A.; Hardt, Cornelia; Lang, Karl S.; Lang, Philipp A.",Commun Biol,596,17

Outcomes from ICU and prediction models are not well explored in Rwanda owing to lack of appropriate scores. This study aimed to assess reasons for admission and accuracy of prediction models for mortality of obstetric patients admitted to ICUs of two public tertiary hospitals in Rwanda. METHODS: We prospectively collected data from all obstetric patients admitted to the ICUs of the two public tertiary hospitals in Rwanda from March 2017 to February 2018 to identify reasons for admission, demographic and clinical characteristics, outcome including death and its predictability by both the Modified Early Obstetric Warning Score (MEOWS) and quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA). We analysed the accuracy of mortality prediction models by MEOWS or qSOFA by using logistic regression adjusting for factors associated with mortality. Area under the Receiver Operating characteristic (AUROC) curves is used to show the predicting capacity for each individual tool. RESULTS: Obstetric patients (n = 94) represented 12.8 % of all 747 ICU admissions which is 1.8 % of all 4.999 admitted women for pregnancy or labor. Sepsis (n = 30; 31.9 %) and obstetric haemorrhage (n = 24; 25.5 %) were the two commonest reasons for ICU admission. Overall ICU mortality for obstetric patients was 54.3 % (n = 51) with average length of stay of 6.6 ± 7.525 days. MEOWS score was an independent predictor of mortality (adjusted (a)OR 1.25; 95 % CI 1.07–1.46) and so was qSOFA score (aOR 2.81; 95 % CI 1.25–6.30) with an adjusted AUROC of 0.773 (95 % CI 0.67–0.88) and 0.764 (95 % CI 0.65–0.87), indicating fair accuracy for ICU mortality prediction in these settings of both MEOWS and qSOFA scores. CONCLUSIONS: Sepsis and obstetric haemorrhage were the commonest reasons for obstetric admissions to ICU in Rwanda. MEOWS and qSOFA scores could accurately predict ICU mortality of obstetric patients in resource-limited settings, but larger studies are needed before a recommendation for their use in routine practice in similar settings.","Rudakemwa, Alcade; Cassidy, Amyl Lucille; Twagirumugabe, Théogène",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,596,1

One plausible way of enhancing the therapeutic effect of virotherapy is to enable it with the ability to concurrently engage the infiltrating immune cells to provide additional antitumor mechanisms. Here, we report the construction and evaluation of two novel chimeric molecules (bispecific chimeric engager proteins, BiCEP and trispecific chimeric engager protein, TriCEP) that can engage both natural killer (NK) and T cells with tumor cells for enhanced antitumor activities. METHODS: BiCEP was constructed by linking orthopoxvirus major histocompatibility complex class I-like protein, which can selectively bind to NKG2D with a high affinity to a mutant form of epidermal growth factor (EGF) that can strongly bind to EGF receptor. TriCEP is similarly constructed except that it also contains a modified form of interleukin-2 that can only function as a tethered form. As NKG2D is expressed on both NK and CD8(+) T cells, both of which can thus be engaged by BiCEP and TriCEP. RESULTS: Both BiCEP and TriCEP showed the ability to engage NK and T cells to kill tumor cells in vitro. Coadministration of BiCEP and TriCEP with an oncolytic herpes simplex virus enhanced the overall antitumor effect. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing analysis revealed that TriCEP not only engaged NK and T cells to kill tumor cells, it also promotes the infiltration and activation of these important immune cells. CONCLUSIONS: These novel chimeric molecules exploit the ability of the oncolytic virotherapy in altering the tumor microenvironment with increased infiltration of important immune cells such as NK and T cells for cancer immunotherapy. The ability of BiCEP and TriCEP to engage both NK and T cells makes them an ideal choice for arming an oncolytic virotherapy.","Ravirala, Divya; Mistretta, Brandon; Gunaratne, Preethi H; Pei, Guangsheng; Zhao, Zhongming; Zhang, Xiaoliu",J Immunother Cancer,596,12

Attributable disease burdens were estimated by applying the population-attributable fractions to WHO’s Global Health Estimates of total disease burdens. RESULTS: In 2016, 488 million people (95% uncertainty range: 472–503 million), or 8.9% (8.6–9.1) of the global population, were exposed to working long hours (≥55 hours/week). An estimated 745,194 deaths (705,786–784,601) and 23.3 million disability-adjusted life years (22.2–24.4) from ischemic heart disease and stroke combined were attributable to this exposure. The population-attributable fractions for deaths were 3.7% (3.4–4.0) for ischemic heart disease and 6.9% for stroke (6.4–7.5); for disability-adjusted life years they were 5.3% (4.9–5.6) for ischemic heart disease and 9.3% (8.7–9.9) for stroke. CONCLUSIONS: WHO and ILO estimate exposure to long working hours (≥55 hours/week) is common and causes large attributable burdens of ischemic heart disease and stroke. Protecting and promoting occupational and workers’ safety and health requires interventions to reduce hazardous long working hours.","Pega, Frank; Náfrádi, Bálint; Momen, Natalie C.; Ujita, Yuka; Streicher, Kai N.; Prüss-Üstün, Annette M.; Descatha, Alexis; Driscoll, Tim; Fischer, Frida M.; Godderis, Lode; Kiiver, Hannah M.; Li, Jian; Magnusson Hanson, Linda L.; Rugulies, Reiner; Sørensen, Kathrine; Woodruff, Tracey J.",Environ Int,596,32

Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS), a clinician performed, and clinician interpreted bedside ultrasound examination has been increasingly used for DVT evaluation mainly in the urgent and critical care setting, but also in the ambulatory clinics and the medical wards. Studies have demonstrated that POCUS has excellent diagnostic accuracy for acute proximal DVT when performed by well-trained users. However, there is significant heterogeneity among studies on the necessary extent of training and universally acceptable standardized education protocols are needed. In this review, we summarize the evidence that supports the use of POCUS to diagnose acute proximal DVT and focus on methodology and current technology, sensitivity and specificity, pre-test probability and the role of D-dimer, time and resources, education, limitations, and future directions.","Varrias, Dimitrios; Palaiodimos, Leonidas; Balasubramanian, Prasanth; Barrera, Christian A; Nauka, Peter; Melainis, Angelos Arfaras; Zamora, Christian; Zavras, Phaedon; Napolitano, Marzio; Gulani, Perminder; Ntaios, George; Faillace, Robert T.; Galen, Benjamin",J Clin Med,596,5

Higher concentration of surface ozone has been observed to have negatively impacted agricultural yield of crops. Due to its deleterious impact on human health and agriculture, air pollution cannot be brushed off as a trivial matter and measures must be taken to address the problem. Deterministic models have been actively used; but they fall short due to their complexity and inability to accurately model the problem.

Two concepts are used: the lack of alignment and—more extreme—the disconnect between judiciary and society. Ranking countries by trust in the judiciary, in the lowest 20% there is a disconnect of judiciary and society, in the 20% around the median and in the highest 20% there is lack of alignment. Disconnect and lack of alignment seem to be self-perpetuating, as judges do not perceive the state of independence as problematic. Indications are that even a disconnect does not reduce the use of the civil courts, but that it leads citizens to avoid administrative law procedures. A disconnect weakens the position of the judiciary within the trias politica. This reinforces the complicated relationship between the judiciary and the other state powers. Where the other state powers see an increasing influence of the judiciary, the judiciary sees its own independence endangered. These perspectives clash. For the judiciary the way out is to focus on access to justice as an alternative perspective. By addressing the urgent legal needs of citizens, the judiciary has the potential to improve its alignment with society and its position within the trias politica.","van Dijk, Frans",Perceptions of the Independence of Judges in Europe,596,16

We assume that each walker visits independently the nodes of a finite ergodic graph in a discrete-time Markovian walk governed by his specific transition matrix. With this assumption, we first derive an upper bound for the reproduction numbers. Then, we assume that a walker is in one of the states: susceptible, infectious, or recovered. An infectious walker remains infectious during a certain characteristic time. If an infectious walker meets a susceptible one on the same node, there is a certain probability for the susceptible walker to get infected. By implementing this hypothesis in computer simulations, we study the space-time evolution of the emerging infection patterns. Generally, random walk approaches seem to have a large potential to study epidemic spreading and to identify the pertinent parameters in epidemic dynamics.","Bestehorn, Michael; Riascos, Alejandro P.; Michelitsch, Thomas M.; Collet, Bernard A.",Continuum Mech,596,0

As multiple workloads are executed concurrently, conflicts in memory resource occur, resulting in observable timing variations during execution. Malicious tenants can intentionally manipulate the hardware platform to devise a covert channel, enabling them to steal the data of co-residing tenants. This paper presents two new microarchitectural covert channel attacks using the memory controller. The first attack allows a privileged adversary (i.e. process) to leak information in a native environment. The second attack is an extension to cross-VM scenarios for unprivileged adversaries. This work is the first instance of leakage channel based on the memory controller. As opposed to previous denial-of-service attacks, we manage to modulate the load on the channel scheduler with accuracy. Both attacks are implemented on cross-core configurations. Furthermore, the cross-VM covert channel is successfully tested across three different Intel microarchitectures. Finally, a comparison against state-of-the-art covert channel attacks is provided, along with a discussion on potential mitigation techniques.","Semal, Benjamin; Markantonakis, Konstantinos; Akram, Raja Naeem; Kalbantner, Jan",ICT Systems Security and Privacy Protection,596,1

The aim of our study was to examine tissue PACAP-38 in a translational porcine MI model and plasma PACAP-38 levels in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Significantly lower PACAP-38 levels were detected in the non-ischemic region of the left ventricle (LV) in MI heart compared to the ischemic region of MI-LV and also to the Sham-operated LV in porcine MI model. In STEMI patients, plasma PACAP-38 level was significantly higher before percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) compared to controls, and decreased after PCI. Significant negative correlation was found between plasma PACAP-38 and troponin levels. Furthermore, a significant effect was revealed between plasma PACAP-38, hypertension and HbA1c levels. This was the first study showing significant changes in cardiac tissue PACAP levels in a porcine MI model and plasma PACAP levels in STEMI patients. These results suggest that PACAP, due to its cardioprotective effects, may play a regulatory role in MI and could be a potential biomarker or drug target in MI.","Szabo, Dora; Sarszegi, Zsolt; Polgar, Beata; Saghy, Eva; Nemeth, Adam; Reglodi, Dora; Makkos, Andras; Gorbe, Aniko; Helyes, Zsuzsanna; Ferdinandy, Peter; Herczeg, Robert; Gyenesei, Attila; Cziraki, Attila; Tamas, Andrea",Int J Mol Sci,596,8

Biomolecules can be detected in the proposed structure through modulation of ambipolar current between channel and drain. Modulation of ambipolar current is performed by extending gate over drain in order to create a gate to drain overlap (cavity) by etching the specific portion of the gate. Trapped biomolecules within cavity gets immobilized. Immobilized biomolecules change the drain to channel tunneling width, thus changing the ambiploar leakage current. Drain doping and cavity length was fine-tuned to achieve better sensitivity in terms of ambipolar current and ambipolar knee voltage shift with and without presence of biomolecules. A maximum sensitivity of 3.8 × 10(7) is achieved for drain doping of 5 × 10(19) donors/cm(3) and cavity length of 60 nm. A high value of sensitivity is achieved for each biomolecules when drain doping ranged from 10(19) donors/cm(3) to 5 × 10(19) donors/cm(3) and cavity length ranged between 40 nm to 50 nm.

Since then, a number of Chinese chestnut cultivars and Japanese-Chinese hybrid cultivars have been selected by farmers and plant breeders, but little information has been available about their origins and genetic relationships. A classification based on simple sequence repeat markers was conducted using 230 cultivars including Japanese chestnut (Castanea crenata Sieb. et Zucc.) cultivars originated in Japan, Japanese-Chinese hybrid cultivars, and Chinese chestnut cultivars originated in both Japan and China. First, a search for synonyms (cultivars with identical genotypes) revealed 23 synonym groups among the Chinese chestnut cultivars, and all but one cultivar from each synonym group was omitted from further analyses. Second, genetic structure analysis showed a clear division between Japanese and Chinese chestnut, and most of the Japanese and Chinese cultivars had a simple genetic structure corresponding to the expected species. On the other hand, most Japanese-Chinese hybrid cultivars had admixed genetic structure. Through a combination of parentage and chloroplast haplotype analyses, 16 of the 18 hybrid cultivars in this study were inferred to have parent-offspring relationships with other cultivars originated in Japan. Finally, Bayesian clustering and chloroplast haplotype analysis showed that the 116 Chinese chestnut cultivars could be divided into two groups: one originated in the Hebei region of China and the other originated in the Jiangsu and Anhui regions of China. The Chinese chestnut cultivars selected in Japan showed various patterns of genetic structure including Hebei origin, Jiangsu or Anhui origin, and admixed. The chestnut cultivar genetic classifications obtained in this study will be useful for both Japanese and Chinese chestnut breeding programs.","Nishio, Sogo; Ruan, Shuan; Sawamura, Yutaka; Terakami, Shingo; Takada, Norio; Takeuchi, Yukie; Saito, Toshihiro; Inoue, Eiich",PloS one,596,1

This can reduce the utility of sex-specific mortality statistics for governments to address health problems. To assess whether there are sex differences in completeness and quality of data from civil registration and vital statistics systems, we analysed available global death registration and cause of death data. METHODS Completeness of death registration for females and males was compared in 112 countries, and in subsets of countries with incomplete death registration. For 64 countries with medical certificate of cause of death data, the level, severity and type of garbage causes was compared between females and males, standardised for the older age distribution and different cause composition of female compared with male deaths. RESULTS For 42 countries with completeness of less than 95% (both sexes), average female completeness was 1.2 percentage points (p.p.) lower (95% uncertainty interval (UI) -2.5 to -0.2 p.p.) than for males. Aggregate female completeness for these countries was 7.1 p.p. lower (95% UI -12.2 to -2.0 p.p.; female 72.9%, male 80.1%), due to much higher male completeness in nine countries including India. Garbage causes were higher for females than males in 58 of 64 countries (statistically significant in 48 countries), but only by an average 1.4 p.p. (1.3-1.6 p.p.); results were consistent by severity and type of garbage. CONCLUSION Although in most countries analysed there was no clear bias against females in death registration, there was clear evidence in a few countries of systematic undercounting of female deaths which substantially reduces the utility of mortality data. In countries with cause of death data, it was only of marginally poorer quality for females than males.","Adair, Tim; Gamage, U S H; Mikkelsen, Lene; Joshi, Rohina",BMJ global health,596,1

As immunity accumulates in a population - naturally during the course of an epidemic or through vaccination - the spread of an infectious disease is limited by the depletion of susceptible hosts. If a sufficient proportion of the population is immune - above the 'herd immunity threshold' - then transmission generally cannot be sustained. Maintaining herd immunity is therefore critical to long-term disease control. In this primer, we discuss the concept of herd immunity from first principles, clarify common misconceptions, and consider the implications for disease control.","Ashby, Ben; Best, Alex",Current biology : CB,596,33

We studied electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities, in particular QT interval and its relationship with anti-Ro antibodies, disease activity, and serum interleukin 1β (IL-1β), interleukin 6 (IL-6) in SLE. METHODS A 12-lead resting ECG was performed on 140 adult SLE patients fulflling SLICC/ACR classification criteria. All patients received hydroxychloroquine and prednisolone. Corrected QT (QTc) °440 milliseconds (ms) was defined as prolonged QTc. QT dispersion (QTd) °60 ms was defined as increased QTd. RESULTS Eighty-four patients had some form of ECG abnormality. Prolongation of QTc and QTd was present in 24 (17.1%) and 50 (35.7%) respectively. Anti-Ro/SSA antibodies were present in 63 (45%). Prolongation of QTc in anti-Ro positive versus anti-Ro negative was 17.5% and 17% respectively, p=0.98. Prolongation of QTd in anti-Ro-positive versus anti-Ro-negative was 32% and 39% respectively, p=0.37. Prolonged QTc was observed in 15% patients with SLEDAI ˛4 compared to 17.5% patients with SLEDAI °5, p=0.78. The median serum concentrations of IL-1β and IL-6 were similar in the groups with and without prolonged QTc, with and without prolonged QTd. On binary logistic regression analyses neither clinical nor laboratory factors were predictors of prolonged QTc. However, having valvular regurgitation and hypercholesterolemia was associated with significantly reduced odds of having prolonged QTd, adjusted OR 0.33 (CI 0.14-0.83), p=0.018 and 0.19 (CI 0.05-0.80), p=0.023 respectively. Those with high LDL cholesterol and hypertriglyceridemia had a significantly higher odds of having a normal QTd with adjusted OR of 4.34 (1.31-14.46) p=0.017and 5.59 (1.62-19.38) p=0.007respectively. CONCLUSION Though 17% and 35% SLE patients have QTc and QTd prolongation, association with anti-Ro antibodies or disease activity was absent. A large proportion has other asymptomatic ECG abnormalities that may reflect subclinical cardiac involvement.","Azharudeen, Mohamed; Thabah, Molly Mary; Satheesh, Santhosh; Negi, Vir Singh",The journal of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh,596,12

In this paper, we show that the outbreak of an epidemic can be effectively contained and suppressed in a small subnetwork by a combination of antidote distribution and partial quarantine. We improve over existing antidote distribution schemes based on personalized PageRank in two ways. First, we replace the constraint on the topology of this subnetwork described by Chung et al. [Internet Math. 6, 237 (2009)1542-795110.1080/15427951.2009.10129184] that a large fraction of the value of the personalized PageRank vector must be contained in the local cluster, with a partial quarantine scheme. Second, we derive a different lower bound on the amount of antidote. We show that, under our antidote distribution scheme, the probability of the infection spreading to the whole network is bounded, and the infection inside the subnetwork will disappear after a period that is proportional to the logarithm of the number of initially infected nodes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy with numerical simulations of epidemics on benchmark networks. We also test our strategy on two examples of epidemics in real-world networks. Our strategy is dependent only on the rate of infection, the rate of recovery, and the topology around the initially infected nodes, and is independent of the rest of the network.","Lu, Zhenqi; Wahlström, Johan; Nehorai, Arye",Physical review.

OBJECTIVES To identify factors influencing pharmacologic anticoagulation initiation after spine surgery based on the AOSpine Anticoagulation Global Survey. METHODS This survey was distributed to the international membership of AOSpine (n = 3805). A Likert-type scale described grade practice-specific factors on a scale from low (1) to high (5) importance, and patient-specific factors a scale from low (0) to high (3) importance. Analysis was performed to determine which factors were significant in the decision making surrounding the initiation of pharmacologic anticoagulation. RESULTS A total of 316 spine surgeons from 64 countries completed the survey. In terms of practice-specific factors considered to initiate treatment, expert opinion was graded the highest (mean grade ± SD = 3.2 ± 1.3), followed by fellowship training (3.2 ± 1.3). Conversely, previous studies (2.7 ± 1.2) and unspecified guidelines were considered least important (2.6 ± 1.6). Patient body mass index (2.0 ± 1.0) and postoperative mobilization (2.3 ± 1.0) were deemed most important and graded highly overall. Those who rated estimated blood loss with greater importance in anticoagulation initiation decision making were more likely to administer thromboprophylaxis at later times (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.68-0.71), while those who rated drain output with greater importance were likely to administer thromboprophylaxis at earlier times (HR = 1.32-1.43). CONCLUSION Among our global cohort of spine surgeons, certain patient factors (ie, patient mobilization and body mass index) and practice-specific factors (ie, expert opinion and fellowship training) were considered to be most important when considering anticoagulation start times.","Gandhi, Sapan D; Khanna, Krishn; Harada, Garrett; Louie, Philip; Harrop, James; Mroz, Thomas; Al-Saleh, Khalid; Brodano, Giovanni Barbanti; Chapman, Jens; Fehlings, Michael G; Hu, Serena S; Kawaguchi, Yoshiharu; Mayer, Michael; Menon, Venugopal; Park, Jong-Beom; Rajasekaran, Shanmuganathan; Valacco, Marcelo; Vialle, Luiz; Wang, Jeffrey C; Wiechert, Karsten; Riew, K Daniel; Samartzis, Dino",Global spine journal,596,1
66165,66165,66165,Barriers and facilitators to accessing tuberculosis care in Nepal: a qualitative study to inform the design of a socioeconomic support intervention.,20.039366,6.3304477,2021-10-01,"PURPOSE In head and neck cancer (HNC) various treatment strategies have been developed to improve outcome, but selecting patients for these intensified treatments remains difficult. Therefore, identification of novel pretreatment assays to predict outcome is of interest. In HNC there are indications that pretreatment tumour (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake may be an independent prognostic factor. The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic value of FDG uptake and CT-based and FDG PET-based primary tumour volume measurements in patients with HNC treated with (chemo)radiotherapy. METHODS A total of 77 patients with stage II-IV HNC who were eligible for definitive (chemo)radiotherapy underwent coregistered pretreatment CT and FDG PET. The gross tumour volume of the primary tumour was determined on the CT (GTV(CT)) and FDG PET scans. Five PET segmentation methods were applied: interpreting FDG PET visually (PET(VIS)), applying an isocontour at a standardized uptake value (SUV) of 2.5 (PET(2.5)), using fixed thresholds of 40% and 50% (PET(40%), PET(50%)) of the maximum intratumoral FDG activity (SUV(MAX)) and applying an adaptive threshold based on the signal-to-background (PET(SBR)). Mean FDG uptake for each PET-based volume was recorded (SUV(mean)). Subsequently, to determine the metabolic volume, the integrated SUV was calculated as the product of PET-based volume and SUV(mean). All these variables were analysed as potential predictors of local control (LC), regional recurrence-free survival (RRFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS In oral cavity/oropharynx tumours PET(VIS) was the only volume-based method able to predict LC. Both PET(VIS) and GTV(CT) were able to predict DMFS, DFS and OS in these subsites. Integrated SUVs were associated with LC, DMFS, DFS and OS, while SUV(mean) and SUV(MAX) were not. In hypopharyngeal/laryngeal tumours none of the variables was associated with outcome. CONCLUSION There is no role yet for pretreatment FDG PET as a predictor of (chemo)radiotherapy outcome in HNC in daily routine. However, this potential application needs further exploration, focusing both on FDG PET-based primary tumour volume, integrated SUV and SUV(MAX) of the primary tumour.","Schinagl, Dominic A X; Span, Paul N; Oyen, Wim J; Kaanders, Johannes H A M",European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,596,16

Due to the high transmission of this disease, studies are ongoing to discover an inhibitor drug that can stop this disease. In this study, inhibitory drugs used for many diseases were tried to stop the SARS-CoV-2 virus. AIM In the calculations made, inhibitor molecules for the SARS-CoV-2 virus were calculated by molecular docking method. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION Inhibitory activities of SARS-CoV-2 virus against spike glycoprotein (PDB ID: 6M0J, 6LZG), main protease (PDB ID: 5RGG, 6WTT), and RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (PDB ID: 6YYT, 7BV2) proteins were compared. Then, docking calculations were supported by calculations by MM-PSBA of the inhibitor with the highest activity. Afterwards, it was compared with FDA approved drugs for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It was found that the Carvedilol molecule was the best against RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) protein of SARS-CoV-2 (Tab. 4, Fig. 9, Ref. 42).","Gedikli, M A; Tuzun, B; Sayin, K; Ataseven, H",Bratislavske lekarske listy,596,16

This in vitro study applies angiographic analysis of intra-aneurysmal flow to compare the flow-diversion performance of five neurovascular devices in idealized sidewall and bifurcation aneurysm models. Methods Five commercial devices (Enterprise, Neuroform, LVIS, FRED, and Pipeline) were implanted in silicone sidewall and bifurcation aneurysm models under physiological average flow of blood analog fluid. High-speed angiographic images were acquired pre- and post-device implantation and contrast concentration-time curves within the aneurysm were recorded. The curves were quantified with five parameters to assess changes in contrast transport, and thus aneurysm hemodynamics, due to each device. Results Inter-device flow-diversion performance was more easily distinguished in the sidewall model than the bifurcation model. There were no obvious overall statistical trends in the bifurcation parameters but the Pipeline performed marginally better than the other devices. In the sidewall geometry, overall evidence suggests that the LVIS performed better than the Neuroform and Enterprise. The Pipeline and FRED devices were statistically superior to the three stents and Pipeline was superior to FRED in all sidewall parameters evaluated. Conclusions Based on this specific set of experiments, lower-porosity flow diverters perform significantly better in reducing intra-aneurysmal flow activity than higher-porosity stents in sidewall-type geometries. The LVIS device is potentially a better flow diverter than the Neuroform and Enterprise devices, while the Pipeline is potentially better than the FRED.","Dholakia, Ronak J; Kappel, Ari D; Pagano, Andrew; Woo, Henry H; Lieber, Baruch B; Fiorella, David J; Sadasivan, Chander","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",596,27

Methods: A retrospective study was performed on 11 patients underwent CIFA for skull base lesions dissection from December 2014 to January 2019 in the department of otolaryngology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital. There were 6 male and 5 female patients, with age range of 16-72 years old and median age of 53 years old. Five patients underwent CIFA Type B and D, and the other 6 underwent CIFA A and B. All patients were followed up regularly by CT and MRI to observe possible recurrence. Results: Among the 5 patients with CIFA Type B and D, 3 were giant cell tumor and 2 were giant cell reparative granuloma, and median maximum cross-section size was 42 mm×46 mm (range from 37 mm×18 mm to 56 mm×53 mm). Among the 6 patients with CIFA Type A and B, 4 were paraganglioma of head and neck, 1 was schwannoma of skull base, 1 was petrous cholesteatoma, and median maximum cross-section size was 43 mm×36 mm (range from 24 mm×22 mm to 63 mm×35 mm). Nine patients underwent complete resection of the tumor in the first stage. In 2 patients, the extracranial parts were removed in the first stage, and the intracranial part was removed in the second stage. Tympanum and ossicular reconstruction were done in one of the CIFA Type B and group D, and 1 year's postoperative hearing was mild conductive hearing loss. There was no cerebrospinal fluid leakage of all patients. All the 5 patients with normal facial nerve function before surgery recovered to H-B grade Ⅰ to Ⅱ within 3 months after surgery. Among the 4 patients whose preoperative facial nerve function were grade Ⅱ, 2 recovered to grade I after surgery and the other 2 were still grade Ⅱ. For the patient whose preoperative facial nerve function was grade Ⅴ, his postoperative recovery was grade Ⅲ. There was 1 patient whose pre-operative FN function was H-B grade Ⅲ, and the post-operative FN function was grade Ⅵ due to FN resection. Except for 2 cases with cochlear involved before surgery, cochleae of the other 9 cases were preserved. The follow-up time was 14 to 58 months. No recurrence was observed in all patients. Conclusions: The CIFA can safely and completely remove the extensive lesions that invade the skull base, and the facial nerve function can be well protected and recovered intro-and post-operation. Appropriate use of combined IFA can not only achieve good exposure and complete resection of lesions, but also create conditions for functional reconstruction.","Wei, X M; Gao, Z Q; Xu, Z Q; Yang, H; Zhang, Z H; Tian, X; Zhao, Y; Zhou, Y L; Feng, G D",Zhonghua er bi yan hou tou jing wai ke za zhi = Chinese journal of otorhinolaryngology head and neck surgery,596,31

Methods In this study, bioinformatics analysis was used to screen for target miRNAs from the open-access TCGA database. Transwell assays, Western blotting, and qRT-PCR analyses were used to detect cellular functions and gene expression in HCC cells and samples. A nude mouse tumorigenesis model was established to facilitate the observation of HCC progression. Other assays included luciferase reporter assays, IHC, and survival analysis. Results We found that the identified miR-876 from TCGA was expressed at low levels in HCC cell lines and that low miR-876 expression was corrected with liver cirrhosis, tumor thrombus, and TNM stage. Further research revealed that miR-876 regulated cell invasion, EMT, and collagen expression by targeting POSTN expression. miR-876 and POSTN were inversely correlated in HCC samples and associated with EMT status and liver fibrosis in clinical HCC tissues. miR-876 inhibited the liver cancer progression in in vivo animal assays. Finally, both miR-876 and POSTN were risk factors for HCC survival, and HCC patients with combined low miR-876 and high POSTN expression had worse prognosis. Conclusions miR-876 inhibited HCC EMT and fibrosis by targeting POSTN, thus affecting HCC progression and prognosis. miR-876 and POSTN may be useful therapeutic targets or prognostic markers of HCC.","Chen, Kai; Li, Zhonghu; Zhang, Mengyun; Wang, Bo; Peng, Tao; Shen, Yanbing; Zhang, Jianxin; Ye, Jiaxin; Liu, Yu; Tang, Di; Peng, Minjie; Ma, Dandan; Xiao, Zhengkang; Zhang, Yujun; Jin, Weidong; Li, Xiaowu",BioMed research international,596,1

Here, we demonstrate the use of the rapid affinity pair identification via directed selection (RAPIDS) method to discover multiple affinity pairs for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N-protein), a biomarker of COVID-19, from in vitro libraries in 10 weeks. The pair with the highest biomarker sensitivity was then integrated into a 10-minute, vertical-flow cellulose paper test. Notably, the as-identified affinity proteins were compatible with a roll-to-roll printing process for large-scale manufacturing of tests. The test achieved 40 pM and 80 pM limits of detection in 1×PBS (mock swab) and saliva matrices spiked with cell-culture generated SARS-CoV-2 viruses and is also capable of detection of N-protein from characterized clinical swab samples. Hence, this work paves the way towards the mass production of cellulose paper-based assays which can address the shortages faced due to dependence on nitrocellulose and current manufacturing techniques. Further, the results reported herein indicate the promise of RAPIDS and engineered binder proteins for the timely and flexible development of clinically relevant diagnostic tests in response to emerging infectious diseases.","Kim, Seunghyeon; Yee, Emma H; Miller, Eric A; Hao, Yining; Tay, Dousabel M Y; Sung, Ki-Joo; Jia, Huan; Johnson, Joseph M; Saeed, Mohsan; Mace, Charles R; Yurt, Deniz Yüksel; Sikes, Hadley",ChemRxiv : the preprint server for chemistry,596,1

However, the epidemic could rebound when such measures are relaxed, possibly leading to a requirement for a second or more, repeated lockdowns2. Here, we present results of a stochastic agent-based microsimulation model of the COVID-19 epidemic in France. We examined the potential impact of post-lockdown measures, including physical distancing, mask-wearing and shielding individuals who are the most vulnerable to severe COVID-19 infection, on cumulative disease incidence and mortality, and on intensive care unit (ICU)-bed occupancy. While lockdown is effective in containing the viral spread, once lifted, regardless of duration, it would be unlikely to prevent a rebound. Both physical distancing and mask-wearing, although effective in slowing the epidemic and in reducing mortality, would also be ineffective in ultimately preventing ICUs from becoming overwhelmed and a subsequent second lockdown. However, these measures coupled with the shielding of vulnerable people would be associated with better outcomes, including lower mortality and maintaining an adequate ICU capacity to prevent a second lockdown. Benefits would nonetheless be markedly reduced if most people do not adhere to these measures, or if they are not maintained for a sufficiently long period.","Hoertel, Nicolas; Blachier, Martin; Blanco, Carlos; Olfson, Mark; Massetti, Marc; Rico, Marina Sánchez; Limosin, Frédéric; Leleu, Henri",Nature medicine,596,19

Readily observable, PRD-derived cytoplasmic condensates underwent fusion and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching consistent with the PRD LLPS in vitro. Simulations demonstrated that the charge properties of the PRD predicted phase separation. Tau PRD formed heterotypic condensates with EB1, a regulator of plus-end microtubule dynamic instability.

COVID-19 has increased the urgency of caring for patients remotely. Collection of electronic patient-reported outcomes (ePROs) has demonstrated efficacy for patients on intravenous chemotherapy, but limited data support their use in oral chemotherapy. We undertook a pilot project to assess the feasibility of implementing an ePRO system for patients starting oral chemotherapy at our cancer center, which includes both an academic site and a community site. METHODS Patients initiating oral chemotherapy were asked to participate. A five-question tool was built in REDCap. Concerning responses triggered outreach within one business day. The primary outcome was time to first symptom assessment. For comparison, we used a historical cohort of patients who had been prescribed oral chemotherapies by providers in the same disease groups at the cancer center. RESULTS Twenty-five of 62 (40%) patients completed ePRO assessments. Fifty historical charts were reviewed. Time to first symptom assessment was 7 days (IQR, 4-14 days) in the historical group compared with 3 days (IQR, 2-4 days) in the ePRO group. Time to clinical action was 14 days (7-35 days) in the historical group compared with 8 days (4-19 days) in the ePRO group. No statistically significant differences were detected in 30-day emergency department visit or hospitalization (12% for both groups) or 90-day emergency department visit or hospitalization rates (historical 28% and ePRO 20%). CONCLUSION An ePRO tool monitoring patient concerns about adherence, cost, and toxicities for patients with new oral chemotherapy regimens is feasible and improves time to symptom assessment. Further investigation is needed to improve patient engagement with ePROs and evaluate the long-term impacts for patients on oral chemotherapy.","Doolin, Jim W; Berry, Jonathan L; Forbath, Natalia S; Tocci, Noah X; Dechen, Tenzin; Li, Stephanie; Hartwell, Rebekah A; Espiritu, Jennifer K; Roberts, Daniel A; Zerillo, Jessica A; Shea, Meghan",JCO clinical cancer informatics,596,19

For instance, in the current COVID-19 crisis, patients can expect prolonged intubation. This protracted intubation may produce health complications such as tracheal stenosis, pneumonia, and necrosis of tracheal tissue, as current ETTs are not designed for extended use. In this work, we propose an improved ETT design that seeks to overcome these limitations by utilizing unique geometries which enable a novel expanding cylinder. The mechanism provides a better distribution of the contact forces between the ETT and the trachea, which should enhance patient tolerability. Results show that at full expansion, our new ETT exerts pressures in a silicone tracheal phantom well within the recommended standard of care. Also, preliminary manikin tests demonstrated that the new ETT can deliver similar performance in terms of air pressure and air volume when compared with the current gold standard ETT. The potential benefits of this new architected ETT are threefold, by limiting exposure of healthcare providers to patient pathogens through streamlining the intubation process, reducing downstream complications, and eliminating the need of multiple size ETT as one architected ETT fits all.","Berard, David; Navarro, Juan David; Bascos, Gregg; Harb, Angel; Feng, Yusheng; De Lorenzo, Robert; Hood, R Lyle; Restrepo, David",Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials,596,1

The results of preliminary molecular docking showed that MOL000519 (from Pinelliae Rhizoma), MOL000554 (from Farfarae Flos), MOL004798 (from Ephedrae Herba), MOL004824 (from Glycyrrhizae Radix Et Rhiizoma), MOL010428 (from Asteris Radix Et Rhizoma), and MOL013443 (from Aurantii Fructus Immaturus) had good affinity with SARS-CoV-2 3CL hydrolase to form complexes with stable conformations and high binding activity (binding energy ≤- 5 kJ/mol). CONCLUSIONS Qingfei Paidu decoction can treat COVID-19 through its multiple medicinal ingredients that have multiple targets and involve multiple signaling pathways for different biological functions. Our finding provides reference for further investigation into the pharmacological mechanism of Qingfei Paidu decoction in treating COVID-19.","Yan, Haiyan; Zou, Yan; Zou, Chuncai",Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University,596,1

It is predominantly a respiratory pathogen that also affects the gastrointestinal tract. The ACE 2 receptor is the main receptor of SARS-CoV-2, with evidence of its high presence in the intestine, colon and cholangiocytes, and, in smaller proportion, in hepatocytes. SARS-CoV-2 has a gastrointestinal tropism that explains digestive symptoms and viral spread in stools. The characteristics of this virus include the S (Spike) protein that binds very stably to the ACE-2 receptor and, at the same time, SARS-CoV-2 produces dysbiosis and alterations in the gut-lung axis. It produces a clear T-cell response and a cytokines storm in the intestine and liver that would produce inflammatory bowel damage. Intestinal manifestations by order of frequency are loss of appetite, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, and abdominal pain, where the latter could be a severity marker. In children, diarrhea is the most frequent symptom, usually mild and self-limiting. In the liver, hypertransaminasemia occurs in severe patients ranging from 40 to 60%. SARS-CoV-2 can re main in stools longer than in respiratory secretions, which would influence the spread of disease. This article highlights the importance of an early diagnosis of gastrointestinal and hepatic manifestations, increase the index of suspicion, make a timely diagnosis, and recognize eventual complications of the disease. The potential oral-fecal route of transmission may influence the disease spread. Recognizing this finding is important to define isolation.","Villanueva Ch, Mónica; Faundez H, Rossana; Godoy, Marcela",Revista chilena de pediatria,596,12

In this study, the impact of such a training was investigated for rehearsal of patient-specific cases as well as for a structured simulation curriculum to teach angiographer novices. MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 40 patients undergoing a diagnostic neuroangiography were randomized in a training and control group. In all training group patients, the angiographer received a patient-anatomy-specific rehearsal on a high-fidelity simulator prior to the real angiography. Radiation exposure, total duration, fluoroscopy time and amount of contrast agent of the real angiography were recorded. Silent cerebral ischemia was counted by magnetic resonance diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Additionally, the first 30 diagnostic neuroangiographies of six novices were compared (ntotal = 180). Three novices had undergone a structured simulation curriculum; three had acquired angiographic skills without simulation. RESULTS No differences were found in the number of DWI lesions or in other quality measures of the angiographies performed with and without patient-specific rehearsal. A structured simulation curriculum for angiographer novices reduced fluoroscopy time significantly and radiation exposure. The curriculum had no influence on the total duration of the examination, the amount of contrast medium or the number of catheters used. CONCLUSION There was no measurable benefit of patient-anatomy-specific rehearsal for an unselected patient cohort. A structured simulation-based curriculum to teach angiographic skills resulted in a reduction of fluoroscopy time and radiation dose in the first real angiographies of novice angiographers.

Digital health packages include data standards, guidance on data analysis, specifications for analytical dashboards for a specific health area, including a configuration of these standards for a widely used software platform. METHODS This is a multi-year case study, in which the authors have actively participated in the various aspects of development, implementation and evaluation of the digital health packages initiative. RESULTS We discuss the key innovations of the digital health package approach: First, the development process, which is based on flexible standards and an integrated approach across health programmes. Second, how the digital health packages combine several related types of standards into one package, including configurations for a widely used software platform supported by strong global and regional technical teams. OUTCOME This study shows a novel approach to dissemination of standards, through a digital platform. Currently, 40 countries have adopted one or more of the digital health packages in their national health information system.","Poppe, Olav; Sæbø, Johan Ivar; Braa, Jørn",International journal of medical informatics,596,24

We have standardized our laparoscopic anatomical hepatectomy (LAH) procedure, gradually extending its indications. In the present study, we describe our experience and the perioperative and oncological outcomes of LAH for HCC compared to those of open anatomical hepatectomy (OAH) during the gradual introduction of LAH. METHODS Seventy patients with primary HCC underwent anatomical hepatectomy in our institution from November 2008 to April 2014. As we gained experience with LAH, our indications for choosing LAH over OAH gradually expanded. Ultimately, 40 and 30 patients underwent LAH and OAH, respectively. Perioperative and oncological outcomes were compared between the two groups. RESULTS There were no significant differences in age, sex, background of liver disease, liver function, tumor size, tumor number, or type of liver resection between the two groups. Major complications and mortality rates were similar between the LAH and OAH groups (12.5% vs. 20%; p = 0.582, and 0% vs. 3.3%; p = 0.429, respectively). The median follow-up time after surgery was 40.5 months in the LAH group and 32.9 months in the OAH group (p = 0.835). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 89.9, 84.7, and 70.9%, in the LAH group, and 89.8, 68.0, and 63.1% in the OAH group, respectively (p = 0.255). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year disease-free survival rates were 79.5, 58.0, and 42.5%, in the LAH group, and 72.4, 56.1, and 50.4% in the OAH group, respectively (p = 0.980). CONCLUSIONS Through gradual introduction of LAH, we obtained comparable results to those achieved with OAH. LAH can be a feasible surgical treatment for primary HCC, with good oncological outcomes.","Ryu, Tomoki; Honda, Goro; Kurata, Masanao; Kobayashi, Shin; Sakamoto, Katsunori; Honjo, Masahiko",Surgical endoscopy,596,1

How to cooperate with the government's pandemic-prevention policies and reduce the gap between education and clinical practice represent significant challenges. In this paper, Chang Gung University of Science and Technology (CCUST) is used as an example to show how schools in Taiwan have effectively adapted the fundamentals of nursing practicum programs to the current pandemic using e-learning, group discussions, case analysis, clinical skill practice, and clinical case simulation scenario exercises. The program at CCUST both takes into account the safety of students and has achieved all critical nursing practice goals. After implementation of these adjustments, satisfaction among nursing students with the practicum environment and the clinical instructors was found to be significantly higher for the on-campus clinical practicum than for the off-campus clinical practicum. Furthermore, the results of qualitative data analyses show that nursing students in the on-campus practicum gained significant knowledge and experience and commented positively on their experience. For example, the students indicated that they were satisfied with the simulated clinical environment of the CCC, the teaching strategies and adaptability of the instructor, and the application of virtual reality scenario cases to enhance skill proficiency and learning outcomes. The adjusted nursing clinical practicum described in this paper may be used as a reference to ensure the quality of nursing clinical practicum programs is maintained during epidemics.","Liu, Ying-Mei; Chen, Miao-Chuan; Chung, Fen-Fang; Huang, Hsiang-Ping; Chao, Li-Fen; Chen, Mei-Yen; Jane, Sui-Whi; Fan, Jun-Yu",Hu li za zhi The journal of nursing,596,30

Gaining insight into the proficiency of relevant cognitive abilities provides an indication of the processes necessary for a species' survival and reproduction. Many birds have ""slow"" life-histories and complex social environments suggestive of high cognitive ability. Little, however, is known about the cognition of most birds with these traits, thus studying cognition in seabirds with these traits provides insight into how slow life-histories and complex social environments relate more generally to predicting cognitive ability. Object permanence is a cognitive ability shared by highly intelligent animals and is an ecologically relevant ability for many seabirds. I used a simple experimental setup in a semi-controlled environment to test object permanence in captive horned puffins (Fratercula corniculata) by hiding a reward to be retrieved, first partially and then completely. I discovered that the horned puffins performed poorly on the object permanence task when the reward was hidden completely. I discuss briefly how the slow life-histories of many seabirds probably evolved due to the stochastic conditions associated with their marine environment, which in turn may cause an energetic bottleneck that limits the allocation of resources to certain cognitive abilities.","Huffeldt, Nicholas Per",Behavioural processes,596,14

We have previously shown that TXA2R antagonist SQ29548 attenuates BV2 microglia activation by suppression of ERK pathway, but its effect is not tested in vivo. The present study aims to explore the role of TXA2R on microglia/macrophages activation after ischemia/reperfusion brain injury in mice. Adult male ICR mice underwent 90-min transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). Immediately and 24 h after reperfusion, SQ29548 was administered twice to the ipsilateral ventricle (10 μl, 2.6 μmol/ml, per dose). Cerebral infarction volume, inflammatory cytokines release and microglia/macrophages activation were measured using the cresyl violet method, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and immunofluorescence double staining, respectively. Expression of TXA2R was significantly increased in the ipsilateral brain tissue after ischemia/reperfusion, which was also found to co-localize with activated microglia/macrophages in the infarct area. Administration of SQ29548 inhibited microglia/macrophages activation and enrichment, including both M1 and M2 phenotypes, and attenuated ischemia-induced IL-1ß, IL-6, and TNF-α up-regulation and iNOS release. TXA2R antagonist SQ29548 inhibited ischemia-induced inflammatory response and furthermore reduced microglia/macrophages activation and ischemic/reperfusion brain injury.","Yan, Aijuan; Zhang, Tingting; Yang, Xiao; Shao, Jiaxiang; Fu, Ningzhen; Shen, Fanxia; Fu, Yi; Xia, Weiliang",Scientific reports,596,20

MATERIALS AND METHODS Western Africa was defined in accordance with the United Nations' delineation and inclusive of 16 countries. A literature search for publications detailing the number of cobalt-60 machines (COs) and linear accelerators (LINACs) in radiotherapy centres was carried out. Population data from the World Bank Group and crude cancer rates from the International Agency for Research on Cancer were used to calculate ratios of million persons per MVM and MVMs per 1000 cancer cases. RESULTS The numbers of MVMs in Western Africa in 1969, 1979, 1989, 1999 and 2009 were zero, two, three, six and nine, respectively. In 2019 there were 22 MVMs distributed across Ghana (five), Côte d'Ivoire (two), Mali (one), Mauritania (two), Nigeria (nine) and Senegal (three). Nine countries (56.3%) had no history of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). The largest increase in absolute EBRT capacity occurred from 2017 to 2019, during which 13 MVMs were commissioned. The largest decrease in EBRT capacity occurred from 2015 to 2017, during which four LINACs and three COs were rendered non-operational. The ratio of million persons per MVM improved from 67.0 in 1979 to 17.8 in 2019. As of 2019, there was 0.09 MVM per 1000 cancer cases. CONCLUSIONS Western African nations have experienced an increase in the absolute number of MVMs and per capita radiotherapy capacity during the last 50 years, especially in the last decade. As non-functional LINACs contributed to a temporary decline in the EBRT infrastructure, dual use of CO/LINAC technologies may act to promote the availability of EBRT treatment in centres with capacity for multiple MVMs.","Taku, N; Polo, A; Zubizarreta, E H; Prasad, R R; Hopkins, K",Clinical oncology (Royal College of Radiologists (Great Britain)),596,12

A previous cross-sectional study in middle-aged and older adults enrolled in the Atahualpa Project Cohort demonstrated that 45% of participants had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, 77% of whom were symptomatic. Here, we assessed the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the above-mentioned rural population. One month after baseline testing, 362 of 370 initially seronegative individuals were re-tested to assess incidence of seroconversion and associated risk factors. Twenty-eight of them (7.7%) became seropositive. The overall incidence rate ratio was 7.4 per 100 person months of potential virus exposure (95% C.I.: 4.7-10.2). Six seroconverted individuals (21.4%) developed SARS-CoV-2-related symptomatology. The only covariate significantly associated with seroconversion was the use of an open latrine. Predictive margins showed that these individuals were 2.5 times more likely to be infected (95% C.I.: 1.03-6.1) than those using a flushing toilet. Therefore, along one month, approximately 8% of seronegative individuals became infected, even after almost half of the population was already seropositive. Nevertheless, a smaller proportion of incident cases were symptomatic (21% versus 77% of the earlier cases), and no deaths were recorded. Whether this decreased clinical expression resulted from a lower viral load in new infections cannot be determined. Increased seroconversion in individuals using latrines is consistent with a contributory role of fecal-oral transmission, although we cannot rule out the possibility that latrines are acting as a proxy for poverty or other unknown interacting variables.","Del Brutto, Oscar H; Costa, Aldo F; Mera, Robertino M; Recalde, Bettsy Y; Bustos, Javier A; García, Héctor H",Pathogens and global health,596,26

Overlapping peptides encompassing the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein N-terminal 1- to 643-amino acid sequence and the membrane protein were used as stimulus. SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies targeting the S1 protein were assessed by ELISA at month 6. RESULTS Detectable (≥0.1%) SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T-cell response was found in 57.1% and 47.4% of patients at months 4 and 6. Corresponding rates for CD8 T-cells were 19.0% and 42.1%, respectively. Absolute SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell counts increased from month 4 to month 6 in CD8 (P-value = 0.086) but not CD4 subsets (P-value = 0.349). Four out of 10 patients with any detectable response at month 4 had lost SARS-CoV-2-CMI by month 6, whereas 5 out of 9 patients mounted SARS-CoV-2-CMI within this period.

The purpose of this systematic review was to present an overview of the inflammatory response and the serum markers associated with hernia repair and to compare the response between patients treated with and without mesh. METHODS The review was conducted in line with PRISMA guidelines. The outcomes of interest were serum concentration of leukocytes, cytokines, and acute phase proteins before and after hernia repair with or without mesh reinforcement. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane ROBINS-I tool for non-randomized studies of intervention. RESULTS A total of 31 studies were included in the systematic review including 1326 patients with a mean age ranging from 33 to 67 years. The studies predominantly included males (95.0% males, 5.0% female) with inguinal hernias (98.5% inguinal hernias, 1.5% incisional hernias). The inflammatory response after hernia repair was characterized by an increase in CRP, IL-6, leukocytes, neutrophils, IL-1, IL-10, fibrinogen, and α1-antitrypsin and a decrease in lymphocytes and albumin within the first 24 postoperative hours. The systemic inflammatory response was normalized before or on the seventh postoperative day. A higher CRP and IL-6 serum concentration was found in patients treated with mesh compared with sutured repairs. CONCLUSIONS Hernia repair elicits a systemic inflammatory response characterized by an increase in CRP, IL-6, leukocytes, neutrophils, IL-1, IL-10, fibrinogen, and α1-antitrypsin and a decrease in lymphocytes and albumin.

During follow up, subpleural consolidations appeared before symptoms slightly aggravated (cough, tiredness and fever). The patient's condition improved after adjustment of therapy at home. CONCLUSION LUS is an excellent tool in the characterisation of COVID-19 infection and is more available than CT or X-ray. We emphasise the utility and the opportunity that LUS presents in some clinical scenarios, like this COVID-19 pandemic, and how it may serve as a monitoring and therapy guide.","Tung-Chen, Yale",Clinical medicine,596,24

Several surgical and sphincter-sparing approaches have been described for the management of fistula-in-ano, aimed to minimize the recurrence and to preserve the continence. We aimed to systematically review the available studies relating to the surgical management of anal fistulas. MATERIAL AND METHODS A Medline search was performed using the PubMed, Ovid, Embase, and Cochrane databases to identify articles reporting on fistula-in-ano management, aimed to find out the current techniques available, the new technologies, and their effectiveness in order to delineate a gold standard treatment algorithm. RESULTS The management of low anal fistulas is usually straightforward, given that fistulotomy is quite effective, and if the fistula has been properly evaluated, continence disturbance is minimal. On the contrary, high complex fistulas are challenging, because cure and continence are directly competing priorities. CONCLUSIONS Conventional fistula surgery techniques have their place, but new technologies such as fibrin glues, dermal collagen injection, the anal fistula plugs, and stem cell injection offer alternative approaches whose long-term efficacy needs to be further clarified in large long-term randomized trials.","Cadeddu, F; Salis, F; Lisi, G; Ciangola, I; Milito, G",International journal of colorectal disease,596,31

However, this scheme is of limited utility because it is based on invasive angiography. In this study, we assessed whether a relationship between a noninvasive Qureshi score, based on magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or computed tomography angiography (CTA), and 90-day functional outcome could be observed in patients with acute ischemic stroke. METHODS A stroke neurologist evaluated all patients with acute ischemic stroke who presented to the emergency room within 12 hour of symptom onset. Two neurologists independently assessed the noninvasive Qureshi score from initial MRA or CTA. We assessed the relationship between the noninvasive Qureshi grading scheme and clinical outcome on day 90. RESULTS Of a total 125 patients, 75 underwent MRA and 50 underwent CTA. Interobserver reliability showed good agreement (κ = .62). The noninvasive Qureshi score for MRA or CTA and that for CTA alone were directly associated with a good 90-day functional outcome (odds ratio, .672; P = .016 and odds ratio, .511; P = .042). CONCLUSIONS The noninvasive Qureshi scheme using MRA or CTA provides meaningful information about long-term functional outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke.","Shin, Dong-Ick; Lee, Hyung-Suk; Baek, Shin-Hye; Lee, Sang-Soo; Lee, Sung Hyun; Saver, Jeffrey L; Liebeskind, David S",Journal of neuroimaging : official journal of the American Society of Neuroimaging,596,1

The association may be causal or an epiphenomenon due to increased anesthetic sensitivity in high-risk patients. We conducted a pilot study to assess the feasibility of performing a definitive randomized controlled trial. The aims of the study were to determine whether anesthetic depth targeting in a high-risk group was feasible and to document anesthetic doses and arterial blood pressures associated with ""deep"" and ""light"" general anesthesia. METHODS ASA physical status III and IV patients, aged ≥60 years, having surgery lasting ≥2 hours, with expected hospital stay ≥2 days, and receiving general anesthesia were randomly allocated to a Bispectral Index (BIS) or spectral entropy (SE) target of 35 (""low"" group) or 50 (""high"" group). The primary end point was mean BIS or SE. Secondary end points were postanesthesia care unit length of stay and pain scores, quality of recovery score, hospital length of stay, postoperative complications, and death. A composite end point of postoperative complications (pneumonia, myocardial infarction, stroke, pulmonary embolism, heart failure, and death) was determined at 1 year. RESULTS One hundred twenty-five patients were recruited. The mean of the median BIS/SE values for each patient during the maintenance phase of anesthesia in the low and high groups was significantly different: 39 vs 48 (mean difference 8 [95% confidence interval {CI95}, 6 to 10], P < 0.001). There was also a significant difference in mean volatile anesthetic administration (minimum alveolar concentration): 0.98 vs 0.64 (mean difference -0.35 [CI95, -0.44 to -0.26], P < 0.001) and target propofol concentrations: 4.0 vs 3.1 μg/mL (mean difference -0.8 [CI95, -1.2 to -0.3], P = 0.004). Intraoperative mean arterial blood pressures were similar (85 vs 87 mm Hg; mean difference 2 [CI95, -2 to 6], P = 0.86), and there were no differences in short-term recovery characteristics or hospital length of stay. There was a significant difference in the incidence of wound infection at 30 days (13% vs 3%; risk difference -10% [CI95, -21 to -0.1], P = 0.04). At 1 year, the composite rates of complications in the low and high groups were 28% and 17% (risk difference -11 [CI95, -25 to 4], P = 0.15) and mortality rates were 12% and 9%, respectively (risk difference -2 [CI95, -14 to 9], P = 0.70). CONCLUSIONS This pilot study demonstrated that depth of anesthesia targeting with BIS or SE was achievable in a high-risk population with adequate separation of processed electroencephalogram monitor targets. The expected incidence of postoperative complications and mortality occurred. We conclude that a large, multicenter, randomized controlled trial is feasible.","Short, Timothy G; Leslie, Kate; Campbell, Douglas; Chan, Matthew T V; Corcoran, Tomas; O'Loughlin, Edward; Frampton, Chris; Myles, Paul",Anesthesia and analgesia,596,16

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH The Health in Prisons Programme (HIPP) of the WHO Regional Office for Europe worked with partner organizations to review regularly the evidence on best practices in prison health and use it to inform policy recommendations at the global level. HIPP issued overarching guidance and specific tools to support implementation of measures to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19 in prisons and other custodial settings. Moreover, to monitor the emergence of outbreaks, the HIPP developed a minimum data set for countries voluntarily to report COVID-19 cases and identify situations in need of direct support. FINDINGS Since May 2020, the WHO has periodically received data from Member States, leading to the development of country-specific bulletins to support countries and, whenever appropriate, to organize virtual missions to further support ministries and public health bodies responsible for managing COVID-19 in prisons. ORIGINALITY/VALUE The development of a specific set of indicators for prisons enables exploring data in a disaggregated manner.

95325,95325,95325,Analysis of scientific production on the new coronavirus (COVID-19): a bibliometric analysis.,20.080873,6.3309026,2021,"OBJECTIVES In 2009, the Food and Drug Administration approved the use of the surgical robotic system for removal of benign and malignant conditions of the upper aerodigestive tract. This novel application of robotic-assisted surgery, termed transoral robotic surgery (TORS), places robotic instruments and camera system through the mouth to reach recessed areas of the pharynx and larynx. Over the successive decade, there was a rapid adoption of TORS with a surgical growth rate that continues to increase. Despite the rapid clinical acceptance, the field of TORS has not yet seen substantive changes or advances in the technical shortcomings, the lack of which has restricted objective TORS-specific surgical skills assessment as well as subsequent skills improvement efforts. One of the primary technical challenges of TORS is operating in a confined space, where the robotic system is maneuvered within the restrictive boundaries of the mouth and throat. Due to these confined boundaries of the pharynx, instruments can frequently collide with anatomic structures such as teeth and bone, producing anatomic collisions. Therefore, we hypothesized that anatomic collisions negatively impact TORS surgical performance. Secondarily, we hypothesized that avoidance of unwanted anatomic collisions could improve TORS surgical proficiency. METHODS Design and fidelity testing for a custom TORS training platform with an integrated anatomic collision-sensing system providing real-time tactile feedback is described. Following successful platform assembly and testing, validation study using the platform was carried through prospective surgical training with trial randomization. Twenty otolaryngology-head and neck surgery residents, each trainee performing three discrete mock surgical trials (n = 60), performed the initial system validation. Ten of the 20 residents were randomized to perform the surgical trials utilizing the real-time feedback system. The remaining 10 residents were randomized to perform the surgical trials without the feedback system, although the system still could record collision data. Surgical proficiency was measured by Global Evaluative Assessment of Robotic Skills (GEARS) score, time to completion, and tumor resection scores (categorical scale ranging 0-3, describing the adequacy of resection). RESULTS Major anatomic collisions (greater than 5N of force) negatively affected GEARS robotic skills. A mixed model analysis demonstrated that for every additional occurrence of a major collision, GEARS robotic skills assessment score would decrease by 0.29 points (P = .04). Real-time collision awareness created significantly fewer major (> 5 N) anatomic collisions with the tactile feedback system active (n = 30, mean collisions = 2.9 ± 4.2) as compared with trials without tactile feedback (n = 30, mean collisions = 12.53 ± 23.23) (P < .001). The second assessment measure of time to completion was unaffected by the presence of collisions or by the use of tactile feedback system. The third proficiency assessment was measured with tumor resection grading. Tumor resection scores was significantly (P = .02) improved with collision awareness system activated than trials without collision awareness. CONCLUSION In order to test our primary hypothesis, a novel TORS training platform was successfully developed that provides collision force measurements including frequency, severity, and duration of anatomic collisions. Additionally, the platform was modulated to provide real-time tactile feedback of the occurrence of out-of-field collisions. Utilizing this custom platform, our hypothesis that anatomic collisions during TORS diminishes surgical performance was supported. Additionally, our secondary hypothesis that subsequent reduction of anatomic collisions improves TORS proficiency was supported by the surgical trial. Dedicated investigation to characterize the effect size and clinical impact is required in order to translate this finding into training curriculums and into clinical utilization.

We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF from stool and urine AlereLipoarabinomannan [LAM] test in this group of children. METHODS Hospitalised children with presumptive TB and either age <2 years, HIV-positive or severe malnutrition were enrolled in a diagnostic cohort. At enrolment, we attempted to collect two urine, two stool and two respiratory samples. Urine and stool were tested with AlereLAM and Xpert MTB/RIF, respectively. Respiratory samples were tested with Xpert MTB/RIF and mycobacterial culture. Both a microbiological and a composite clinical reference standard were used. RESULTS The study enrolled 219 children; median age 16.4 months, 72 (32.9%) HIV-positive and 184 (84.4%) severely malnourished. Twelve (5.5%) and 58 (28.5%) children had confirmed and unconfirmed TB respectively. Stool and urine were collected in 219 (100%) and 216 (98.6%) children. Against the microbiological reference standard the sensitivity and specificity (n/N, 95% confidence intervals) of stool Xpert MTB/RIF was 50.0% (6/12, 21.1-78.9) and 99.1% (198/200 96.4-99.9), while that of urine AlereLAM was 50.0% (6/12, 21.1-78.9) and 74.6% (147/197, 67.9-80.5) respectively. Against the composite reference standard sensitivity was reduced to 11.4% (8/70) for stool and 26.2% (17/68) for urine, with no major difference by age group (<2 and >2 years) or HIV status.

Because dual tasking is associated with greater postural challenges, it was hypothesized that spinal excitability would be reduced when simultaneously performing 2 tasks. For this experiment, participants maintained a lying or standing posture with or without performing a concurrent cognitive task (i.e., reacting to an auditory tone). Spinal excitability was assessed by eliciting the soleus Hoffmann reflex (H-reflex). Results indicated that the H-reflex was 6.4 ± 2.3% smaller (p = .011) when dual compared to single tasking. The reduced H-reflex amplitude, indicating a depressed spinal excitability, when dual tasking is suggested to reflect a neural strategy that individuals adopt to maintain postural stability when cognitive resources are divided between 2 concurrent tasks.","Weaver, Tyler B; Janzen, Matthew R; Adkin, Allan L; Tokuno, Craig D",Journal of motor behavior,596,16

It is unknown how this feature-specific wiring of circuitry develops before eye opening. Here, we suggest that LHCs in V1 may originate from spatio-temporally structured feedforward activities generated from spontaneous retinal waves. Using model simulations based on the anatomy and observed activity patterns of the retina, we show that waves propagating in retinal mosaics can initialize the wiring of LHCs by co-activating neurons of similar tuning, whereas equivalent random activities cannot induce such organizations. Simulations showed that emerged LHCs can produce the patterned activities observed in V1, matching the topography of the underlying orientation map. The model can also reproduce feature-specific microcircuits in the salt-and-pepper organizations found in rodents. Our results imply that early peripheral activities contribute significantly to cortical development of functional circuits.Significance statementLong-range horizontal connections (LHCs) in the primary visual cortex (V1) are observed to emerge before the onset of visual experience, thereby selectively connecting iso-domains of orientation map. However, it is unknown how such feature-specific wirings develop before eye-opening. Here, we show that LHCs in V1 may originate from the feature-specific activation of cortical neurons by spontaneous retinal waves during early developmental stages. Our simulations of a visual cortex model show that feedforward activities from the retina initialize the spatial organization of activity patterns in V1, which induces visual feature-specific wirings in the V1 neurons.

Zika virus is responsible for severe neurological effects, such as paralytic Guillain-Barrè syndrome, in adults, and also congenital malformations, especially microcephaly.

This study deals with the investigation of the composition, cytotoxicity, and anti-Zika activity of Punica granatum leaf ethanolic extract, fractions, and phytoconstituents. P. granatum leaves were collected from different areas in Italy and Greece in different seasons. Crude extracts were analyzed and fractionated, and the pure compounds were isolated. The phytochemical and biomolecular fingerprint of the pomegranate leaves was determined. The antiviral activities of the leaf extract, fractions, and compounds were investigated against the MR766 and HPF2013 Zika virus strains in vitro. Both the extract and its fractions were found to be active against Zika virus infection. Of the compounds isolated, ellagic acid showed particular anti-Zika activities, with EC50 values of 30.86 µM for MR766 and 46.23 µM for HPF2013. The mechanism of action was investigated using specific antiviral assays, and it was demonstrated that ellagic acid was primarily active as it prevented Zika virus infection and was able to significantly reduce Zika virus progeny production.

With focus shifted to the inflammatory/immune response in the pathogenesis of periodontitis, there is a critical need to evaluate host modulatory agents. Synthetic and biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs are a cornerstone for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Recent prospective cohort studies showed that synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs improved periodontal clinical parameters following nonsurgical periodontal treatment in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Treatment with recombinant humanized monoclonal antibodies against CD20 (rituximab) and IL-6 receptor (tocilizumab), the latter also in clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia, resulted in decreased periodontal inflammation and improved periodontal status. Studies on the effect of TNF-α inhibitors in patients with periodontitis yielded inconsistent results. Recent data suggest that probiotics provide anti-inflammatory clinical benefit, as do nutritional supplements, such as n-3 fatty acids, when combined with periodontal therapy. Probiotics reduce the production of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines by suppressing NF-κB pathways and promote the accumulation of T regulatory cells. Statins, like aspirin, have been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory and bone-preserving actions by upregulating production of Specialized Proresolving Mediators (SPMs). Currently, there is insufficient scientific support for the topical delivery of statins or bisphosphonates as adjuncts to periodontal therapy. Here, we present a critical review of the most recent host modulatory agents applied in humans and the key immune pathways that they target. Emerging evidence from novel drug candidates, including SPMs and complement inhibitors as previously studied in animal models and currently in human clinical trials, suggests future availability of adjunctive therapeutic strategies for the management of periodontitis.","Balta, M G; Papathanasiou, E; Blix, I J; Van Dyke, T E",Journal of dental research,596,1

BACKGROUND Transfemoral access (TFA) has been associated with the risk of bleeding and increased mortality that is elevated compared to transradial access (TRA) in acute coronary syndromes, although less consistently in NSTE acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) than in STE-ACS. METHODS The ACCOAST study evaluated a prasugrel loading dose of 60 mg given at the start of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) versus a split loading dose of 30 mg given at the time of diagnosis of NSTE-ACS (prior to coronary angiography), followed by 30 mg given at the start of PCI. In the study, choice of access site was at the investigator's discretion. We compared ischemic and bleeding outcomes with TFA versus those with TRA, using propensity score correction. RESULTS Of 4,033 patients, 1,711 (42%) underwent TRA. Use of TRA varied widely by country. TFA was not associated with significant increases in noncoronary bypass graft (CABG)-related thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) (hazard ratio [HR] for TFA = 1.46; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.59 to 3.62; p = 0.42), nor in GUSTO (Global Utilization Of Streptokinase and Tpa for Occluded arteries) or STEEPLE (Safety and Efficacy of Enoxaparin in PCI) major bleeding after propensity score correction. TFA, however, increased combined non-CABG TIMI major or minor bleeding (HR for TFA = 2.34; 95% CI: 1.17 to 4.69; p = 0.017). Primary ischemic outcomes did not differ by access site, albeit individual endpoint analysis suggested an association between TFA with an increase in urgent revascularizations and reduced risk of procedure-related stroke. CONCLUSIONS In the ACCOAST trial, TFA did not significantly increase TIMI major bleeding, although TRA was associated with a reduction in TIMI major or minor bleeding. Further study is needed to determine whether wider application of radial approach to NSTE-ACS patients at high risk for bleeding improves overall outcomes.

AIMS We aim to assess the psychological impact of Covid-19 on frontline health care workers (HCWs), including anxiety, depression and stress of threat of the disease. METHOD The study was a cross-sectional survey among the frontline HCWs in a hospital at Jinan, China. Data were collected through an anonymous, self-rated questionnaire, including basic demographic data, a 10-item Covid-19 stress questionnaire, the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS). The risk and rate of anxiety, depression and stress of Covid-19 were estimated. RESULTS Among the 309 participants, there were 88 (28.5%) with anxiety and 172 (56.0%) with depression. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that age ⩽ 30 years, age > 30 to 45 years, working in confirmed case isolation wards, and worrying about disinfection measures being not sufficient were independently associated with anxiety with an odds ratio (95% confidence interval, CI) of 4.4 (1.6-12.2), 3.1 (1.1-8.8), 2.3 (1.4-4.0) and 2.5 (1.5-4.3), respectively; age ⩽ 30 years, age > 30 to 45 years, nurse and worrying about disinfection measure being not sufficient were independently associated with depression with an odds ratio (95% CI) of 3.8 (1.8-7.8), 2.7 (1.3-5.7), 2.5 (1.1-5.6) and 2.1 (1.3-3.5), respectively. CONCLUSIONS A high prevalence of anxiety and depression was found among frontline HCWs during the COVID-19 outbreak. More psychological care should be given to young staffs and nurses.

However, the mechanism(s) by which interactions of CAs with recent stress affect adult depression remain unclear. AIMS To investigate the predictive association of the interaction among CAs and recent stress with early-adult depression. METHOD We conducted an annual survey of all freshmen for the period of 2016-2018 in a Chinese comprehensive university, with a sample size of 23,206. An online questionnaire including standardized self-report instruments was used to assess sociodemographic factors, childhood experiences of left-behind (CELB), and maltreatments (CEMTs) including beating (CEB), neglect (CEN), sexual abuse (CESA), recent stress, and current depression (measured by the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire). RESULTS The correlation of Individual CAs and recent stress was significant. In addition to their significant independent/direct incremental effects, all surveyed CAs were associated with increased severity of early-adult depression, and increased frequency of clinically significant depression (CSD), through significant associations with recent stress (mediation effect). History of CEMTs including CEB, CEN, and CESA significantly increased the effects of recent stress on depression (moderation effect). CONCLUSIONS Chinese undergraduate students reported frequent history of exposure to CAs, which increased the likelihood of depression in early adulthood, not only directly but also through the increasing the likelihood (mediation effect) and impact (moderation effect) of recent stress on depression. These novel findings may help to extend our understanding of environmental determinants of depression, and to guide further research, clinical practice, and policy in this context.","Li, Xiaojing; Guo, Wanjun; Tang, Wanjie; Lv, Qiuyue; Zhang, Yamin; Yu, Hua; Wang, Qiang; Deng, Wei; Zhao, Liansheng; Ma, Xiaohong; Meng, Yajing; Li, Mingli; Wang, Huiyao; Chen, Ting; Liu, Yan-Song; Tang, Zhen; Du, Xiang-Dong; Greenshaw, Andrew J; Li, Tao",Depression and anxiety,596,16

The aim of this case series study was to analyze 1-year outcomes in patients with IH treated with Progrip self-gripping mesh compared to polypropylene (PPL) mesh fixed with sutures during the Rives-Stoppa technique. METHODS Between June 2014 and June 2015, we performed a prospective comparative non-randomized (case series) analysis between 25 patients with IH using retromuscular Progrip self-gripping mesh and 25 patients with retromuscular PPL mesh fixed with sutures, under Rives-Stoppa repair. All intraoperative and perioperative morbidities were reported with particular attention to wound infection, seroma or hematoma formation, duration of hospital stay, presence of abdominal wall pain (VAS) and recurrence during long-term follow-up. RESULTS Mean operative time in Progrip group was shorter than Non-Progrip group (101±29.5 versus 121±39.8min). In Progrip group, the only postoperative complication was seroma in two patients; however, in Non-Progrip group, we reported seroma in three patients, and hematoma in 4 patients (p=0.03). The median hospital stay was shorter in Progrip group (5.8±2.2days versus 6.6±2.9days). Mean VAS score in the first 48h was higher in Non-Progrip group than Progrip group (4.9±2.1 versus 8.1±2)(p=0.01). The median follow-up was 13 months (range 12-20 months) and none of the 50 patients had a hernia recurrence. CONCLUSIONS In Rives-Stoppa repair, retromuscular Progrip mesh causes less postoperative pain in the first 48h and lower rate of hematoma than PPL mesh fixed with sutures in the short term follow-up.","Bueno-Lledó, José; Torregrosa, Antonio; Arguelles, Brenda; Carreño, Omar; García, Providencia; Bonafé, Santiago; Iserte, José",International journal of surgery case reports,596,5

ABSTRACT Oscillatory brain activity coordinates the response of cortical neurons to synaptic inputs in a phase-dependent manner. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the human primary motor cortex elicits larger motor evoked potentials (MEPs) when applied at the negative vs. positive peak of the sensorimotor μ-rhythm recorded with electroencephalography (EEG), demonstrating that this phase represents a state of higher excitability of the cortico-spinal system. Here, we investigated the influence of the phase of the μ-rhythm on cortical responses to TMS as measured by EEG. We tested different stimulation intensities above and below resting motor threshold (RMT), and a realistic sham TMS condition. TMS at 110% RMT applied at the negative vs. positive peak of the μ-rhythm was associated with higher absolute amplitudes of TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) at 70 ms (P70) and 100 ms (N100). Enhancement of the N100 was confirmed with negative peak-triggered 90% RMT TMS, while phase of the μ-rhythm did not influence evoked responses elicited by sham TMS. These findings extend the notion that TMS applied at the negative vs. positive peak of the endogenous μ-oscillation recruits a larger portion of neurons as a function of stimulation intensity. This further corroborates that brain oscillations determine fluctuations in cortical excitability and establishes phase-triggered EEG-TMS as a sensitive tool to investigate the effects of brain oscillations on stimulus-related cortical dynamics.

Ultimately, one-third of patients with a parastomal hernia will need surgical correction due to frequent leakage or life-threatening bowel obstruction or strangulation. However, treatment remains a challenge resulting in high recurrence rates. Two single center trials demonstrated that the frequency of parastomal hernias decreases by prophylactic placement of a mesh around the stoma at the time of formation. Unfortunately, both studies were small-sized, single-center studies and with these small numbers less common complications could be missed which were the reasons to initiate a prospective randomized multicenter trial to determine if a retromuscular, preperitoneal mesh at the stoma site prevents parastomal hernia and does not cause unacceptable complications. METHODS One hundred and fifty patients undergoing open procedure, elective formation of a permanent end-colostomy will be randomized into two groups. In the intervention group an end-colostomy is created with placement of a preperitioneal, retromuscular lightweight monofilament polypropylene mesh, and compared to a group with a traditional stoma without mesh. Patients will be recruited from 14 teaching hospitals in the Netherlands during a 2-year period. Primary endpoint is the incidence of parastomal hernia. Secondary endpoints are stoma complications, cost-effectiveness, and quality of life. Follow-up will be performed at 3 weeks, 3 months and at 1, 2, and 5 years. To find a difference of 20% with a power of 90%, a total number of 134 patients must be included. All results will be reported according to the CONSORT 2010 statement.

We aim to evaluate the neonatal outcomes including the incidence of preterm birth, admission to the neonatal unit and incidence of congenital anomalies in this cohort. We will also describe these outcomes in the context of the B.1.1.7. variant outbreak, the dominant variant in Ireland since January 2021, which has had a greater impact on pregnant patients. METHODS This was a retrospective study of liveborn infants, delivered between 1st March 2020 and 1st March 2021, to women with a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 diagnosis during pregnancy, in a tertiary maternity hospital (8,500 deliveries/year). Clinical data were collected, and analyses were performed to evaluate the impact of maternal symptom status, time from diagnosis to delivery and the B.1.1.7. variant on neonatal outcome. RESULTS In total 133 infants (1.6%) were born to women with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 identified during pregnancy. The median birth weight was 3.45 kg and gestational age at birth was 39.3 weeks. 14 infants (10.5%) were preterm. 22 infants (16.5%) required admission to the neonatal unit and 7 (5.3%) were small for gestational age. There was no difference in growth, preterm birth or neonatal unit admission based on maternal symptom status or infection after the outbreak of B.1.1.7. as the dominant strain. CONCLUSIONS Following a COVID-19 infection in pregnancy, there was no increase in the incidence of preterm birth or neonatal intensive care unit admission compared with 5-year hospital data. Maternal symptom status did not influence neonatal outcomes. Further studies to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 in early pregnancy, the variants of concern, particularly the emerging Delta variant and COVID-19 placentitis are required.","Murphy, Claire A; O'Reilly, Daniel P; Edebiri, Osasere; Donnelly, Jennifer C; McCallion, Naomi; Drew, Richard J; Ferguson, Wendy",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,596,31

The AUC instrument can spin samples at speeds up to 60,000 rpm, generating forces approaching 300,000 g. Forces of this magnitude will stretch the titanium rotors used in the instrument, shifting the boundary conditions required to solve the flow equations used in the modeling of the AUC data.

Several endoscopic approaches are available, such as transaxillary, unilateral axillo-breast approach (UABA), modified anterior chest wall approach (MACWA), bilateral axillo-breast approach, and most recently the transoral approach and the robotic-assisted techniques. There is no recommended approach, because each approach has its own positive and negative attributes. We, herein, compare between UABA and MACWA in terms of surgical and cosmetic outcomes. METHODS This prospective study was conducted from April 2016 to August 2017. Forty patients with unilateral benign thyroid lesions were selected. Of them, 20 patients underwent ET using UABA, and 20 patients underwent ET using MACWA. Gas insufflation was implemented for all patients. Clinicopathologic data, surgical outcomes, and cosmetic outcomes in both groups were analyzed. RESULTS There was no significant difference between both groups in the clinicopathologic characteristics. The mean surgical time was significantly longer in the UABA group compared with the chest wall group (147.3 vs. 124.3 min). The postoperative pain scores were relatively lower in the UABA group compared with the MACWA group. We reported a higher rate of persistent paresthesia, neck contracture with swallowing discomfort, and hypertrophic scars in the MACWA group. Cosmetic satisfaction scores for patients who underwent UABA were higher than for those who underwent MACWA. CONCLUSIONS Both approaches were similar in terms of safety, feasibility, and operative complications. Even though the surgical time was longer, patients who underwent the UABA reported relatively less postoperative pain, superior cosmetic results, scar perception, and patient satisfaction compared with MACWA.","Elzahaby, Islam A; Fathi, Adel; Abdelwahab, Khaled; Eldamshiety, Osama; Metwally, Islam H; Abdallah, Ahmed; Ramadan, Mohamed M; Kotb, Sherif; Abdel Aziz, Mahmoud; Refky, Basel; Abouzid, Amr; Saleh, Saleh; Gaballah, Khaled","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",596,1

Adaptation of services and the future outlook in Australia.,20.284924,1.5302396,2020-12-09,"Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is a highly cytopathic virus being developed as a vaccine vector due to its ability to induce strong protective T cell and antibody responses after a single dose. However, little is known regarding the mechanisms underlying the potent immune responses elicited by VSV. We previously generated a VSV vector expressing the hepatitis B virus middle envelope surface glycoprotein (MS) that induces strong MS-specific T cell and antibody responses in mice. After synthesis in the cytoplasm, the MS protein translocates to the endoplasmic reticulum, where it forms subviral particles that are secreted from the cell. To better understand the contributions of secreted and intracellular protein to the VSV-induced immune response, we produced a vector expressing a secretion-deficient MS mutant (MS(C69A)) and compared the immunogenicity of this vector to that of the wild-type VSV-MS vector in mice. As expected, the MS(C69A) protein was not secreted from VSV-infected cells and displayed enhanced proteasome-mediated degradation. Surprisingly, despite these differences in intracellular protein processing, the T cell and antibody responses generated to MS(C69A) were comparable to those elicited by virus expressing wild-type MS protein. Therefore, when it is expressed from VSV, the immune responses to MS are independent of particulate antigen secretion and the turnover rate of cytoplasmic protein. These results are consistent with a model in which the immune responses to VSV are strongly influenced by the replication cycle of the vector and demonstrate that characteristics of the vector have the capacity to affect vaccine efficacy more than do the properties of the antigen itself.","Cobleigh, Melissa A; Bradfield, Clinton; Liu, Yuanjie; Mehta, Anand; Robek, Michael D",Journal of virology,596,1

They also initiate membrane fusion in the acidic environment of endocytic compartments, releasing genetic material into the cell. In the process of membrane fusion, envelope protein exposes fusion peptide, followed by insertion into the cell membrane or endosomal membrane. Further conformational changes ensue in which the type 1 envelope protein forms a typical six-helix bundle structure, shortening the distance between viral and cell membranes so that fusion can occur. Entry inhibitors targeting viral envelope proteins, or host factors, are effective antiviral agents and have been widely studied. Some have been used clinically, such as T20 and Maraviroc for human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) or Myrcludex B for hepatitis D virus (HDV). This review focuses on entry inhibitors that target the six-helical bundle core against highly pathogenic enveloped viruses with class I fusion proteins, including retroviruses, coronaviruses, influenza A viruses, paramyxoviruses, and filoviruses.","Pu, Jing; Zhou, Joey Tianyi; Liu, Ping; Yu, Fei; He, Xiaoyang; Lu, Lu; Jiang, Shibo",Current medicinal chemistry,596,1

Several management options have been suggested and have since gained popularity, though we expect additional modifications to be made, as well as more new cases in the coming months, given a lack of definitive treatment and well-controlled experiments. This review highlights the available and potential treatments, along with the challenges associated with each. MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted a comprehensive overview of all peer-reviewed studies, editorial comments, and letters to the editor based on a search in PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Scopus. The following terms were used: ""COVID-19,"" ""SARS-CoV-2,"" ""drug,"" ""treatment,"" ""medication,"" and ""management."" All searches were done between March and May 20, 2020. RESULTS There are several potential medications available for COVID-19, such as Interferon α (IFN-α), Teicoplanin, Ribavirin, Galidesivir, Lopinavir/Ritonavir, Chloroquine phosphate, Arbidol, Velpatasvir, Favipiravir, Ledipasvir, Remdesivir, Sofosbuvir, Darunavir, Qingfei Paidu Decoction (QPD), and Imatinib. However, we do not have a definitive and specific treatment yet. CONCLUSIONS We are expecting to have more cases in the coming weeks/months. Therefore, further research is needed to characterize the disease behavior, to find the absolute drug, and to refine the treatment.","Alshaeri, H K; Natto, Z S",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,596,30

Computer-assisted drawing and stereolithography was used to create instruments and implants that were evaluated by cadaver surgery. A trial, involving 26 client-owned dogs with lameness due to cranial cruciate ligament failure, was started. Follow-up was done by clinical and radiographic examination after 4 wk and clinical examination again 6-11 mo after surgery. The titanium foam implant maintained tibial tuberosity advancement easily and effectively. The same major complication occurred in 2 of the first 6 cases before, a slightly modified technique was used to treat 20 dogs without complication. At mid-term follow-up (6-11 mo), 20/26 dogs (77%) had returned to full function, two dogs (7.7%) had acceptable function, two dogs (7.7%) could not be evaluated due to recent contra lateral modified Maquet procedure surgery, and two (7.7%) dogs had died for reasons unrelated to the study. This is the first clinical report of the use of titanium foam in veterinary orthopaedics. Modified Maquet procedure appears to be an effective treatment for lameness due to failure of the cranial cruciate ligament in dogs.","Ness, Malcolm Graham",Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association,596,17

METHODS Ninety patients underwent RARP simultaneously completed International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form (ICIQ-SF) and modified pad use questionnaire that evaluated pad use and urinary QoL and a 24-hour pad test. Pad use was also assessed by pad form, pad size, the number of pad exchanges per day, and the timing of pad exchanges (i.e., to what extent the pad was wet when the patients exchanged it.). The investigation involved patients visiting the outpatient clinic for the first time after RARP. The association between pad use and urinary QoL was investigated. RESULTS The mean frequency of pad exchanges was 2±2/day. The mean 24-hour pad test was 139±193 g/day. Multivariate analyses revealed the timing of pad exchanges was significantly associated with QoL on the ICIQ-SF and the modified pad use questionnaire (P=0.007 and P<0.001, respectively) and the number of pad exchanges per day was significantly associated with QoL on the ICIQ-SF (P=0.01); QoL worsened with pad wetness and increasing frequency of pad exchange. The other factors relating to pad use were not significantly associated with aggravation of QoL. CONCLUSIONS In the early postoperative period after RARP, the timing of pad exchanges was the most important factor affecting QoL. Namely, patients with postprostatectomy incontinence should wear the appropriate size of pad according to the volume of urinary incontinence and exchange pads when the pad is not too wet. On the other hand, pad form, pad size, and volume of urinary incontinence were not associated with decreased QoL.","Haga, Nobuhiro; Yanagida, Tomohiko; Yabe, Michihiro; Akaihata, Hidenori; Hata, Junya; Sato, Yuichi; Ogawa, Soichiro; Ishibashi, Kei; Kojima, Yoshiyuki",Journal of endourology,596,19

Methods: A real-time internet-based survey endorsed by the Association for European Paediatric and Congenital Cardiologists (AEPC) Working Groups for Cardiac Imaging and Cardiovascular Intensive Care. Inclusion criteria was children 0-18 years admitted to hospital between February 1 and June 6, 2020 with diagnosis of an inflammatory syndrome and acute cardiovascular complications. Results: A total of 286 children from 55 centers in 17 European countries were included. The median age was 8.4 years (IQR 3.8-12.4 years) and 67% were males. The most common cardiovascular complications were shock, cardiac arrhythmias, pericardial effusion and coronary artery dilatation. Reduced left ventricular ejection fraction was present in over half of the patients and a vast majority of children had raised cardiac troponin (cTnT) when checked. The biochemical markers of inflammation were raised in majority of patients on admission: elevated CRP, serum ferritin, procalcitonin, NT-proBNP, IL-6 level and D-dimers. There was a statistically significant correlation between degree of elevation in cardiac and biochemical parameters and need for intensive care support (p <0.05). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 was positive in 33.6% while IgM and IgG antibodies were positive in 15.7% and IgG 43.6 % cases, respectively when checked. One child died in the study cohort. Conclusions: Cardiac involvement is common in children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome associated with Covid-19 pandemic. A majority of children have significantly raised levels of NT pro-BNP, ferritin, D-dimers and cardiac troponin in addition to high CRP and procalcitonin levels. Compared to adults with Covid-19, mortality in children with MIS-C is uncommon despite multi-system involvement, very elevated inflammatory markers and need for intensive care support.","Valverde, Israel; Singh, Yogen; Sanchez-de-Toledo, Joan; Theocharis, Paraskevi; Chikermane, Ashish; Di Filippo, Sylvie; Kucinska, Beata; Mannarino, Savina; Tamariz-Martel, Amalia; Gutierrez-Larraya, Federico; Soda, Giridhar; Vandekerckhove, Kristof; Gonzalez Barlatey, Francisco; McMahon, Colin Joseph; Marcora, Simona Anna; Pace Napoleone, Carlo; Duong, Phuoc; Tuo, Giulia; Deri, Antigoni; Nepali, Gauri; Ilina, Maria; Ciliberti, Paolo; Miller, Owen",Circulation,596,16

Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, several antimicrobial drugs have lost their efficacy and are no longer useful to treat life-threatening infections. Since the exacerbation of antimicrobial resistance is likely to be another casualty of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a pressing need to develop innovative strategies to minimize the risk of antimicrobial resistance. AREAS COVERED : Focusing on the COVID-19 pandemic, I have briefly summarized the current knowledge and challenges in our understanding of antimicrobial resistance, emphasizing quorum sensing and quorum quenching. Our understanding of bacterial communication by quorum sensing to acquire virulence has paved the way to reduce bacterial pathogenicity through quorum quenching. Availability of clinically viable quorum quenching agents would likely to diminish bacterial virulence to create a microenvironment for the host phagocytic cells to reduce bacterial infection. EXPERT OPINION : Future studies that aim to generate clinically useful quorum quenching agents need to be considered. An important benefit of such agents may be a diminished risk of antimicrobial resistance.","Razzaque, Mohammed S",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,596,1

METHODS An economic evaluation was conducted alongside an open, two-arm, parallel-group, pragmatic, multicentre, randomised controlled trial conducted in several hospitals in the UK. Patients were randomised into either SH or TH surgery between January 2011 and August 2014 and were followed up for 24 months. Intervention and subsequent resource use data were collected using case review forms and questionnaires. Benefits were collected using the EQ-5D-3L (EuroQoL-five dimensions-three levels) instrument. The primary economic outcome was incremental cost measured in pounds (£), year 2016 values, relative to the incremental benefit, which was estimated using quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Cost and benefits accrued in the second year were discounted at 3.5%. The base-case analysis was based on imputed data. Uncertainty was explored using univariate sensitivity analyses. RESULTS Participants (n = 777) were randomised to SH (n = 389) or TH (n = 388). The mean cost of SH was £337 (95% confidence interval [CI] 251-423) higher than that of TH and the mean QALYs were -0.070 (95% CI -0.127 to -0.011) lower than for TH. The base-case cost-utility analysis indicated that SH has zero probability of being cost effective at both the £20,000 and the £30,000 threshold. Results from the sensitivity analyses were similar to those from the base-case analysis. CONCLUSIONS The evidence suggests that, on average, the total mean costs over the 24-month follow-up period were significantly higher for the SH arm than for the TH arm. The QALYs were also, on average, significantly lower for the SH arm. These results were supported by the sensitivity analyses. Therefore, in terms of cost effectiveness, TH is a superior surgical treatment for the management of grade II-IV haemorrhoids when compared with SH.","Kilonzo, Mary M; Brown, Steven R; Bruhn, Hanne; Cook, Jonathan A; Hudson, Jemma; Norrie, John; Watson, Angus J M; Wood, Jessica",PharmacoEconomics - open,596,15

Isolates from 36 infected persons shared two highly related pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns and highly related whole genome sequencing (WGS) subtypes. The initial focus of the local public health investigation on food items rather than food sources (i.e., restaurants) through a questionnaire, difficulty in food history recollection among ill persons, and sporadic case identification over periods from months to years contributed to delayed source identification. The Kalamazoo County Health and Community Services Department (KHCSD) and the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) collected clinical specimens, performed multiple rounds of environmental testing, and conducted multiple regulatory visits, and based on accumulated findings over 10 years, identified the restaurant source. A 2018 investigation by KCHCSD and MDHHS found that environmental samples and stool specimens from asymptomatic restaurant employees tested positive for the Salmonella Mbandaka outbreak strain. A complex association between the restaurant environment and employees resulted in patron illnesses. Environmental health interventions, facility renovation, asymptomatic employee exclusions, employee health monitoring, and recurrent facility environmental sampling measures were implemented. As a result of ongoing cases and environmental persistence of Salmonella Mbandaka, the restaurant closed permanently in 2018. Restaurant employee stool testing and environmental sampling for Salmonella early during the investigation of confirmed Salmonella cases linked to a restaurant enhances source identification. Exclusion or restriction of asymptomatic food workers with stool-positive nontyphoidal Salmonella should be considered part of restaurant outbreak mitigation.","Nettleton, William D; Reimink, Bethany; Arends, Katherine D; Potter, Douglas; Henderson, Justin J; Dietrich, Stephen; Franks, Mary",MMWR.

It is endemic in more than 89 different countries worldwide. Sterol alpha-14 demethylase (LdSDM), a sterol biosynthetic pathway enzyme in Leishmania donovani, plays an essential role in parasite survival and proliferation. Here, we used a drug repurposing approach to virtually screen the library of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs against LdSDM to identify the potential lead-drug against leishmaniasis. Zafirlukast and avodart showed the best binding with LdSDM. Zafirlukast was tested for in vitro antileishmanial assay, but no significant effect on L. donovani promastigotes was observed even at higher concentrations. On the other hand, avodart profoundly inhibited parasite growth at relatively lower concentrations. Further, avodart showed a significant decrease in the number of intra-macrophagic amastigotes.

A variety of substitutes are currently available and data suggest that autologous materials are preferred in comparison with nonautologous substitutes. OBJECTIVE To report our experience using locally harvested autologous pericranium as a dural substitute in patients who underwent p-fossa surgeries. METHODS Retrospective analysis of patients who had undergone p-fossa craniotomies between 2005 and 2011. All patients received locally harvested autologous pericranium for duraplasty augmented with a dural sealant. Data were reviewed for complications including: surgical site infection, meningitis, cerebrospinal fluid leak, the radiographic formation of a pseudomeningocele, and any new neurological symptoms related to the incision or repair. RESULTS One hundred patients were identified. Indications for surgery included tumor, vascular lesions, or hemorrhage requiring surgical intervention, symptomatic Chiari I malformation, microvascular decompression for trigeminal neuralgia, and trauma requiring surgical decompression. The complication rate was 1% with 1 patient developing an nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced aseptic meningitis and graft dehiscence requiring surgical revision. CONCLUSION Autologous pericranium with dural sealant augmentation is an effective way to repair the durotomy in p-fossa surgeries. To the best of our knowledge, this is currently the largest study using this technique in the adult neurosurgical literature. Our results report a much lower rate of complications in comparison with other duraplasty studies.","Lam, Fred C; Kasper, Ekkehard",Neurosurgery,596,9

However, this approach is associated with drug-induced toxicity, particularly when the dosage exceeds that necessitated by pathological conditions of diseased tissues. Herein, we developed a modular hybrid hydrogel which could be triggered to release an anti-inflammatory drug upon exposure to elevated protease activity associated with inflammatory diseases. Modular design of the hybrid hydrogel enabled independent optimization of its protease-cleavable and drug-loaded subdomains to facilitate hydrogel formation, cleavability by matrix-metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9), and tuning drug release rate. In vitro study demonstrated the protease-triggered enhancement of drug release from the hybrid hydrogel system for effective inhibition of TNF-α production by pro-inflammatory macrophages and suggested its potential to mitigate drug-induced cytotoxicity. Using non-invasive imaging to monitor the activity of reactive oxygen species in biomaterial-induced host response, we confirmed that the hybrid hydrogel and its constituent materials did not induce adverse immune response after 5 days following their subcutaneous injection in immuno-competent mice. We subsequently incorporated this hybrid hydrogel onto a commercial wound dressing which could release the drug upon exposure to MMP-9. Together, our findings suggested that this hybrid hydrogel might be a versatile platform for on-demand drug delivery via either injectable or topical application to modulate inflammation in chronic diseases.","Nguyen, Dang T; Soeranaya, Bob Hartadhi Tji; Truong, Thi Hong Anh; Dang, Tram T",Acta biomaterialia,596,1

Mounting an immune response is believed to be energetically costly but direct measures of metabolic rate during immune challenges contradict this assumption. The energetic cost of APR for birds is higher than for rodents, suggesting that this response is less expensive for mammals. However, the particularly large increase in metabolic rate after APR activation for a piscivorous bat (Myotis vivesi) suggests that immune response might be unusually costly for bats. Here we quantified the energetic cost and body mass change associated with APR for the nectarivorous Pallas's long-tongued bat (Glossophaga soricina). Activation of the APR resulted in a short-term decrease in body mass and an increase in resting metabolic rate (RMR) with a total energy cost of only 2% of the total energy expenditure estimated for G. soricina. This increase in RMR was far from the large increase measured for piscivorous bats; rather, it was similar to the highest values reported for birds. Overall, our results suggest that the costs of APR for bats may vary interspecifically. Measurement of the energy cost of vertebrate immune response is limited to a few species and further work is warranted to evaluate its significance for an animal's energy budget.","Cabrera-Martínez, Lucia V; Herrera M, L Gerardo; Cruz-Neto, Ariovaldo P",PeerJ,596,31

The aim of this study was to examine the clinicopathological features of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with loss of expression of the SWI/SNF complex. MATERIALS AND METHODS Specimens from a total 1013 NSCLC cases used for tissue microarrays (TMAs) were immunohistochemically examined for expression of SWI/SNF complex (BAF) subunits, namely SMARCA4, SMARCA2, ARID1A, and ARID1B. We examined the clinicopathological features and PD-L1 expression status in NSCLC cases with loss of expression of one or more subunits of the SWI/SNF complex (BAF-Loss). Moreover, we compared the tumor mutation burden (TMB) between NSCLC cases with BAF-Loss and those with intact expression of the four subunits (BAF-Intact). RESULTS Using TMA, BAF-Loss was observed in 5.4% of cases (SMARCA4: 2.4%, SMARCA2: 2.4%, ARID1A: 1.3%, and ARID1B: 0.3%). Concurrent loss of expression of two or more subunits of the SWI/SNF complex was detected in 0.7% of cases. BAF-Loss was significantly associated with smoking history, young age, male sex, pulmonary emphysema/bullae, large invasive tumor size, pleural invasion, vascular invasion, solid-predominant morphology, and absence of a lepidic growth component. A higher proportion of PD-L1-positive cases was observed among NSCLC patients with BAF-Loss than BAF-Intact (42% vs 26%, P < 0.01). In stage I NSCLC, SWI/SNF-Loss (n = 23) was associated with shorter overall survival (HR: 2.43; 95% CI: 1.18-5.01; P = 0.01) and recurrence-free survival (HR: 2.22; 95% CI: 1.17-4.24; P < 0.01) compared to BAF-Intact (n = 563). The degree of TMB was significantly higher among NSCLC patients with BAF-Loss (n = 3) than BAF-Intact (n = 7) (median 437 vs 113 mutations/whole-exome, P = 0.02).

Eleven patients were treated with KYGW circular stapler or KYFB linear stapler (Changzhou Kangdi Medical Stapler). In these patients, 14 staplers were used and 21 stapled sutures (16 linear, 5 circular) were performed. Number of anastomoses successfully completed, postoperative anastomotic fistula or dehiscence, days to take fluid and normal diet, length of hospital stay and anastomotic stenosis were recorded. A 10-point questionnaire enquiring about the instrument and anastomotic features was administered to surgeons immediately after the operation in the study group and in 10 control patients treated with standard CDH circular and SDH linear staples (Ethicon Endo-Surgery). Mean scores on the questionnaire for the experimental and control groups were good (>7.5) and did not significantly differ for handling, closing ease, bleeding, and overall satisfaction. No case of intra-abdominal sepsis, leakage or intestinal obstruction was recorded in the study group. In the 5 patients with colorectal anastomosis, the anastomotic lumen at 15 days was wide open and at 3 months there were no strictures.

The larger the size (or number of VWF multimers), the greater the functionality of the protein. A deficiency or defect of VWF can lead to von Willebrand disease (VWD) and cause bleeding. Conversely, an increase in VWF may create an environment that promotes thrombosis. ADAMS-13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13), sometimes called VWF-cleaving protease, is primarily responsible for controlling the size of VWF. The most severe deficiency (<10% of normal levels) of ADAMTS-13 arises in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, a condition characterized by the presence of ultralarge VWF and clinically resulting in enhanced risk of thrombosis. However, ADAMTS-13 deficiency may result from other pathological processes. Of relevance is the recent finding that COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is associated with both increased levels and activity of VWF as well as generally decreased (or occasionally normal) activity levels of ADAMTS-13. Thus, in COVID-19 there is an alteration in the VWF/ADAMTS-13 axis, most often described by increased VWF/ADAMTS-13 ratio (or reduced ADAMTS-13/VWF ratio). COVID-19 is also associated with high prothrombotic risk. Thus, the imbalance of VWF and ADAMTS-13 in COVID-19 may be providing a milieu that promotes (micro)thrombosis, in a clinical picture resembling a secondary thrombotic microangiopathy in some patients. This review therefore assesses the literature on VWF, ADAMTS-13, and COVID-19. Whenever reported in COVID-19, VWF has always been identified as raised (compared with normal reference ranges or control populations). Reports have included VWF level (i.e., VWF antigen) and in some cases one or more VWF ""activity"" (e.g., collagen binding; platelet glycoprotein Ib [GPIb] binding, using ristocetin cofactor or more modern versions including VWF:GPIbR [recombinant] and VWF:GPIbM [mutant]).

The war in Syria has become notorious for targeted violence against health care. This qualitative study describes health care workers' experiences of violence using semi-structured interviews (n = 25) with professionals who have been working in Syria. The participants were selected using a snowball sampling method and interviewed in Turkey and Europe between 2016-2017. Analysis was conducted using content analysis. Results revealed that the most destructive and horrific forms of violence health care workers have experienced were committed mostly by the Government of Syria and the Islamic State. Non-state armed groups and Kurdish Forces have also committed acts of violence against health care, though their scope and scale were considered to have a lower mortality. The nature of violence has evolved during the conflict: starting from verbal threats and eventually leading to hospital bombings. Health care workers were not only providers of health care to injured demonstrators, they also participated in non- violent anti-government actions. The international community has not taken action to protect health care in Syria.

The first crucial step for the physician in these procedures is the precise needle insertion into the trachea. The primary aim of this technical note was to test the new filament and share our experiences in the implementation of the new device. The secondary aim was to show how a physician with basic training in computer-aided design and three-dimensional (3D) printing could independently create useful devices for clinical practice. METHODS To simplify this referred clinical procedure and increase its safety, 3D printing and a new medical filament were used to develop a new translaryngeal Tracheostomy Needle Introducer (tTNI) for use in conjunction with the Fantoni's method of percutaneous tracheostomy. The tTNI is composed of three parts: a support to fit on the rigid endotracheal tube of the Fantoni kit, an external particular shaped arm, and an introducer for the needle. The latest version of the device used a new filament based on a polyester matrix certified for skin contact that was sterilizable in a standard autoclave. Post-printing, minor technical interventions were required to correct small material deformities. CONCLUSIONS Our experiences with the thread and the technical features of the material were reported herein in conjunction with some suggestions on how to solve the most frequently encountered problems. The 3D printing technique allows physicians to directly manage the prototyping process of new medical devices, making this process completely independent. The speed of the prototyping process and the testing of each piece allow faster creation of a prototype than with traditional industrial methods. Finally, the new biomedical filaments offer endless possibilities of creation and modelling.","Terrani, Alessandro; Bassi, Enrico; Ornaghi, Alberto; Bellani, Giacomo; Foti, Giuseppe",3D printing in medicine,596,12

This paper provides a brief history of the socio-cultural perceptions attached to wearing a mask by surveying how masks were perceived in ancient Greece and Rome, the origins of medical masks, and the ascribed socio-cultural meaning of masks during the COVID-19 pandemic. The use of a mask has historically diverse perceived meanings; currently, wearing a mask communicates a bipolar socio-cultural meaning and a nuanced, divisive symbology. To some, masks communicate a belief in medical science and a desire to protect one's neighbor from contagion. To others, a mask communicates oppression, government overreach, and a skepticism toward established scientific principles. It is the mask's ability to signal a deception, or extrapolated more broadly, a value system, that is highly relevant to current public health guidelines encouraging mask use to decrease the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Public health officials and providers should utilize evidence-based health communication strategies when findings warrant a reversed recommendation of a symbol (such as masks) with a legacy of socio-cultural underpinnings that are deep-seated, complex, and emotional.","Ike, John David; Bayerle, Henry; Logan, Robert A; Parker, Ruth M",Journal of health communication,596,20

Resection of visible lesions with endoscopic mucosal resection followed by field ablation with radio-frequency ablation is now the accepted standard of care in these patients worldwide. This combined approach has shown high rates of disease reversal in several high quality clinical trials but also large volume registry studies. As well as being a minimally invasive and oesophageal sparing interventions compared to surgery with oesophagectomy, endoscopic therapy has proved to be safe and emerging long-term data show sustained benefit in the majority of patients and low rates of cancer progression.

OBJECTIVES This study aimed to report the current rates of laparoscopic colon resection in different types of hospitals in the United States. DESIGN The Nationwide Inpatients Sample database was used to examine the clinical data of patients undergoing elective colon resection for the diagnosis of colon cancer or diverticular disease from 2009 to 2012. SETTING Multivariate regression analysis was performed to compare different hospital types and regions regarding the utilization of laparoscopy. PATIENTS Patients undergoing elective colon resection for the diagnosis of colon cancer or diverticular disease from 2009 to 2012 were selected. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome measured was the rates of laparoscopic colon resection in different types of hospitals. RESULTS We sampled a total of 309,816 patients who underwent elective colon resection. Of these, 171,666 (55.4%) had a laparoscopic operation. The utilization of a laparoscopic approach increased from 51.3% in 2009 to 59.3% in 2012. The increased utilization of a laparoscopic approach was seen in both urban (53.6% vs 61.6%) and rural hospitals (33.4% vs 42.3%), for colon cancer (45% vs 53.5%), and diverticular disease (61.9% vs 68.2%). The conversion rate to open surgery for diverticular disease was significantly higher than for colon cancer (adjusted odds ratio (AOR), 1.23; p < 0.01). After adjustment, urban hospitals (AOR, 2.13; p < 0.01), teaching hospitals (AOR, 1.13; p < 0.01), and large hospitals (AOR, 1.33; p < 0.01) had a greater utilization of laparoscopic surgery. LIMITATIONS This study was limited by its retrospective nature. CONCLUSIONS Although we have finally reached the point where a majority of patients undergoing an elective colectomy for diverticular disease and colon cancer receive a laparoscopic operation, there is wide variation in the implementation of laparoscopic surgery in colon resection in the United States. The utilization of a laparoscopic approach has associations with hospital factors such as size, teaching status of the hospital, and geographic location (urban vs rural).","Moghadamyeghaneh, Zhobin; Carmichael, Joseph C; Mills, Steven; Pigazzi, Alessio; Nguyen, Ninh T; Stamos, Michael J",Diseases of the colon and rectum,596,27

Data from 121665 goats belonging to 1936 different herds were analyzed using generalized linear models. An epidemiological survey was conducted to know the herd immunization status against PTB and the date of last vaccination. All SIT test-positive animals were further investigated in order to confirm the diagnosis of TB, through bacterial culture, and PTB, by histopathological and qPCR analyses. SIT positivity was found in 39 (2.01%) herds, and 507 (0.41%) goats. TB was confirmed by M. caprae or M. bovis isolation in 10 (0.51%) herds and 46 (0.038%) goats. PTB was diagnosed in 13 (33.33%) and 55 (10.84%) of the SIT test-positive herds and goats respectively. Vaccination against PTB showed a significant influence on the results of the SIT test at herd level, with higher positivity detected among those herds vaccinated. However, this effect was not observed when the total number of animals was considered, where the highest positivity was found in unvaccinated goats. The time elapsed between vaccination and SIT test performance also influenced the results. The strongest effect was found when less than eight months elapsed between performing both activities, and to a lesser extent between 8-12 months. Conversely, no positive herds or animals were found when the time elapsed was higher than one year. No significant effect of the presence of PTB was observed. These findings demonstrate that the use of PTB vaccine does not result in false positives to a SIT test at individual level, provided that the time elapsed between the performance of both practices is higher than 12 months.","Espinosa, José; Fernández, Miguel; Royo, Marcos; Grau, Anna; Collazos, Jesús Ángel; Benavides, Julio; Del Carmen Ferreras, María; Mínguez, Olga; Pérez, Valentín",Transboundary and emerging diseases,596,23

This reactivation is orchestrated by the interplay of sleep slow oscillations, spindles, and theta, which are in turn modulated by certain neurotransmitters like GABA to enable long-lasting plastic changes in the memory store. Here we asked whether the GABAergic system and associated changes in sleep oscillations are functionally related to memory reactivation during sleep. We administered the GABAA agonist zolpidem (10 mg) in a double-blind placebo-controlled study. To specifically focus on the effects on memory reactivation during sleep, we experimentally induced such reactivations by targeted memory reactivation (TMR) with learning-associated reminder cues presented during post-learning slow-wave sleep (SWS). Zolpidem significantly enhanced memory performance with TMR during sleep compared with placebo. Zolpidem also increased the coupling of fast spindles and theta to slow oscillations, although overall the power of slow spindles and theta was reduced compared with placebo. In an uncorrected exploratory analysis, memory performance was associated with slow spindle responses to TMR in the zolpidem condition, whereas it was associated with fast spindle responses in placebo. These findings provide tentative first evidence that GABAergic activity may be functionally implicated in memory reactivation processes during sleep, possibly via its effects on slow oscillations, spindles and theta as well as their interplay.","Carbone, Julia; Bibián, Carlos; Reischl, Patrick; Born, Jan; Forcato, Cecilia; Diekelmann, Susanne",Learning & memory,596,1

Methods Between January 2014 and August 2020, 6 cases of traumatic calcaneal osteomyelitis with defect deformities were treated by simultaneous treatment of near-arc bone transport by Ilizarov technique. The patients were all male; aged from 40 to 61 years (mean, 49.3 years). The disease duration was 2-72 months, with an average of 16.1 months. All patients were traumatic calcaneal osteomyelitis, including 4 cases of falling from height, 1 case of traffic accident injury, and 1 case of crushing injury. The infection affected the talar-heel joint in 4 cases, and the talar-heel joint was fused or partially fused in 2 cases. After the external fixator was removed, the Maryland foot scoring system was used to evaluate the foot function, and the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot function scoring system was used to evaluate the ankle-hindfoot function, and were compared with the preoperative scores. Results All patients were followed up 1.5-26.0 months, with an average of 16.3 months. All incisions healed by first intention, no recurrence of infection occurred, and no surgical intervention such as second-stage bone grafting and fusion was performed. Five cases of calcaneal osteomyelitis with defect deformity underwent one-stage osteotomy and slipped, 1 case of the original bone mass after debridement after infection of calcaneal fractures slipped directly. The bone sliding time was 28-62 days, with an average of 38.7 days; the sliding distance was 3.1-5.2 cm, with an average of 3.6 cm. In 1 patient, due to the short follow-up time, the calcaneal slip bone had not healed, the external fixator had not been removed (not involved in clinical scoring), but the foot shape, reexamination of X-ray films and with frame walking were satisfactory. The time with external fixator was 6-8 months, with an average of 6.5 months in the other 5 cases. After removing the external fixator, the foot returned to three-point weight-bearing, and the longitudinal arch was recovered to varying degrees, and there was no obvious varus valgus. The Maryland score after removal of the external fixator was 80.8±4.7, which was significantly higher than that before operation (33.6±4.3) ( t=-35.782, P=0.000), 3 cases were excellent and 2 cases were good; the median AOFAS ankle-hindfoot score was 84, the interquartile range was (79, 86), which was significantly improved when compared with the preoperative score [the median score was 33.5, the interquartile range was (21.3, 37.5)] ( Z=-2.023, P=0.043), 4 cases were excellent and 1 case was good. Among them, pain, walking distance, getting rid of walking aids, going up and down stairs, deformity, etc. were significantly improved when compared with preoperative ones. Mobility such as subtalar and hock joints were poor or disappeared. Conclusion Simultaneous treatment of traumatic calcaneal osteomyelitis and defect deformity with near-arc bone transport by Ilizarov technique can optimize the operation method, reduce the number of operations, and try to simulate the original shape of the calcaneus. It is an effective, economical, and novel treatment method.","Zhang, Lei; Chen, Yusheng; Wang, Xinwei; Hua, Haotian; Sheng, Jingya; Chen, Jiangfei; Guo, Zairan",Zhongguo xiu fu chong jian wai ke za zhi = Zhongguo xiufu chongjian waike zazhi = Chinese journal of reparative and reconstructive surgery,596,1

Second-look endoscopy for hemostasis helps prevent post-ESD bleeding. We investigated the relationships between patient characteristics, tumor characteristics, and the Forrest classification for exposed vessels on artificial ulcers after ESD and evaluated whether hemostasis during second-look endoscopy was useful for preventing post-ESD bleeding. PATIENTS AND METHODS We analyzed 250 patients (265 lesions) who underwent ESD for gastric neoplasms. Vessels classified by Forrest classifications during scheduled second-look endoscopy were analyzed for associations with patient characteristics, tumor characteristics, and recurrent bleeding. RESULTS Two of 250 patients (0.8%) underwent emergency hemostatic endoscopy before scheduled second-look endoscopy. The remaining 248 patients (99.2%) underwent scheduled second-look endoscopy on the day after ESD. Patients with Forrest classification Ia, Ib, or IIa vessels had a significantly higher risk for recurrent bleeding after scheduled second-look endoscopy compared with patients with IIb or III vessels according to univariate analysis (P<0.05) and multivariate logistic regression analysis (odds ratio: 3.45; 95% confidence interval: 1.04-11.41; P=0.042). Univariate analysis indicated that hemodialysis correlated significantly with the presence of Ia, Ib, or IIa vessels compared with that of IIb or III vessels found during second-look endoscopy (P<0.05). Multivariate analysis indicated a significant relationship between hemodialysis and recurrent bleeding after second-look endoscopy (odds ratio: 10.05; 95% confidence interval: 1.97-51.26; P=0.006). CONCLUSION Hemodialysis is a risk factor for post-ESD bleeding. Proper classification of exposed vessels within post-ESD ulcers according to the Forrest classification using second-look endoscopy might help predict or prevent recurrent bleeding.","Noda, Hisatsugu; Ogasawara, Naotaka; Izawa, Shinya; Ozeki, Tomonori; Yanamoto, Kenichiro; Okaniwa, Noriko; Tanabe, Atsushi; Sasaki, Makoto; Kasugai, Kunio",European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology,596,33

The complexity of nuclear waste management motivated the development of solid-phase adsorbents. Herein, co-radiation induced graft polymerization (CRIGP) was employed in the graft polymerization of N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone (NVP) onto polyethylene-coated polypropylene skin-core (PE/PP) fibers using electron beam (EB) irradiation. This work provides a one-step green synthetic approach to prepare iodine fibrous adsorbents without any chemical initiators or large amount of organic solvent. The original and modified PE/PP fibers were characterized by fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), thermogravimetric (TG) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to demonstrate the grafting of NVP onto the PE/PP fibers. The capacity of iodine absorbed by the PE/PP-g-PNVP fibers was 1237.8 mg/g after 180 min. Meanwhile, absorbents can be regenerated efficiently by two different means of ethanol elution and heating at 120 °C, respectively. Within 10 min, 94.17% and 90.12% of the iodine can be released from the PE/PP-g-PNVP fibers with these two methods, respectively. The adsorbent exhibited a long service life of at least ten adsorption-desorption cycles, suggesting that PE/PP-g-PNVP fibers might be a promising adsorbent for volatile iodine adsorption from fission products in nuclear power plant reactors.","Ye, Feng; Huang, Chen; Jiang, Xiaohui; He, Wen; Gao, Xing; Ma, Lin; Ao, Junxuan; Xu, Lu; Wang, Ziqiang; Li, Qingnuan; Li, Jingye; Ma, Hongjuan",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,596,27

In this study, experimental evidence for the emission and transmission of Pseunomonas. amygdali pv. lachrymans (Pal) aerosol was provided, and the results supported that diseased cucumber plants served as the main source of Pal aerosol. Bacterial aerosols released by infected plants played a significant role in the epidemiology of cucumber angular leaf spot (ALS) disease. Aerosol chambers were constructed to study the characteristics of Pal aerosols released by artificially infested cucumber plants. The particle size of Pal aerosol was predominately distributed from 1.1 to 4.7 μm, accounting for 72.16% of the total amount of Pal aerosol. The infection threshold of aerosolized Pal to cause ALS disease was 84-179 CFU/m3.

Therefore, we aimed to determine the incidence of bacterial co-infections, antibiotic use and application of antimicrobial stewardship principles in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS We performed a retrospective observational study in four hospitals (1 university, 2 non-university teaching, 1 non-teaching hospital) in the Netherlands from March to May 2020 including consecutive patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19. Data on first microbiological investigations obtained at the discretion of the physician and antibiotic use in the first week of hospital admission were collected. RESULTS Twelve (1.2%) of the 925 patients included had a documented bacterial co-infection (75.0% pneumonia) within the first week. Microbiological testing was performed in 749 (81%) patients: sputum cultures in 105 (11.4%), blood cultures in 711 (76.9%), pneumococcal urinary antigen testing in 202 (21.8%), and Legionella urinary antigen testing in 199 (21.5%) patients, with clear variation between hospitals. On presentation 556 (60.1%; range 33.3-73.4%) patients received antibiotics for a median duration of 2 days (IQR 1-4). Intravenous to oral switch was performed in 41 of 413 (9.9%) patients who received intravenous treatment >48 h. Mean adherence to the local guideline on empiric antibiotic therapy on day 1 was on average 60.3% (range 45.3%-74.7%). CONCLUSIONS On presentation to the hospital bacterial co-infections are rare, while empiric antibiotic use is abundant. This implies that in patients with COVID-19 empiric antibiotic should be withheld.

RESULTS A total of 12 cases have been attempted of which four required hand assistance and one required conversion to an open approach due to delayed bleeding from a calcified splenic artery that had been transected with laparoscopic GIA stapler device. In total, eight (67%) patients had malignant disease and four (33%) were found to have benign tumors. The median lymph node retrieval is 8 (range 3-16) with no positive margins. The morbidity rate is 17% with one reoperation (8%) and one mortality (8%) at 30 and 90 days. CONCLUSIONS The laparoscopic approach to malignant pancreatic tumors is feasible with similar morbidity and mortality rates to benign series. When tumors are next to the confluence of the splenic portal vein, a hand-assisted approach may be adviseable. Calcified splenic arteries should be sought on preoperative imaging and either transected in non-calcified segments or controlled via open techniques via the hand port.","Gumbs, Andrew A; Chouillard, Elie K",Journal of gastrointestinal cancer,596,1

However, it is still unclear how the performance of the PPG-derived PAV is site-dependent during surgery. The aim of this study is to compare finger- and forehead-PPG derived PAV in their ability to approach the value and trend of ABP-derived PPV. Furthermore, this study investigates four potential confounding factors, (1) baseline variation, (2) PPV, (3) ratio of respiration and heart rate, and (4) perfusion index, which might affect the agreement between PPV and PAV. In this work, ABP, finger PPG, and forehead PPG were continuously recorded in 29 patients undergoing major surgery in the operating room. A total of 91.2 h data were used for analysis, from which PAV and PPV were calculated and compared. We analyzed the impact of the four factors using a multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis. The results show that compared with the ABP-derived PPV, finger-derived PAV had an agreement of 3.2 ± 5.1%, whereas forehead-PAV had an agreement of 12.0 ± 9.1%. From the MLR analysis, we found that baseline variation was a factor significantly affecting the agreement between PPV and PAV. After correcting for respiration-induced baseline variation, the agreements for finger- and forehead-derived PAV were improved to reach an agreement of - 1.2 ± 3.8% and 3.3 ± 4.8%, respectively. To conclude, finger-derived PAV showed better agreement with ABP-derived PPV compared to forehead-derived PAV. Baseline variation was a factor that significantly affected the agreement between PPV and PAV. By correcting for the baseline variation, improved agreements were obtained for both the finger and forehead, and the difference between these two agreements was diminished. The tracking abilities for both finger- and forehead-derived PAV still warrant improvement for wide use in clinical practice. Overall, our results show that baseline-corrected finger- and forehead-derived PAV may provide a non-invasive alternative for PPV.","Sun, Shaoxiong; Peeters, Wouter H; Bezemer, Rick; Long, Xi; Paulussen, Igor; Aarts, Ronald M; Noordergraaf, Gerrit J",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,596,16

Further, it develops a method of ranking each disease in terms of its overall impact, and combines this ranking with published evidence for host genetic variation and information on the current state of genomic tools in each host species. The outcome is an overall ranking of the amenability of each disease to genomic studies that dissect host genetic variation in resistance. Six disease-based assessment criteria were defined: industry concern, economic impact, public concern, threat to food safety or zoonotic potential, impact on animal welfare and threat to international trade barriers. For each category, a subjective score was assigned to each disease according to the relative strength of evidence, impact, concern or threat posed by that particular disease, and the scores were summed across categories. Evidence for host genetic variation in resistance was determined from available published data, including breed comparison, heritability studies, quantitative trait loci (QTL) studies, evidence of candidate genes with significant effects, data on pathogen sequence and on host gene expression analyses. In total, 16 poultry diseases, 13 cattle diseases, nine pig diseases, 11 sheep diseases and three Atlantic salmon diseases were assessed. The top-ranking diseases or pathogens, i.e. those most amenable to studies dissecting host genetic variation, were Salmonella in poultry, bovine mastitis, Marek's disease and coccidiosis, both in poultry. The top-ranking diseases or pathogens in pigs, sheep and Atlantic salmon were Escherichia coli, mastitis and infectious pancreatic necrosis, respectively. These rankings summarise the current state of knowledge for each disease and broadly, although not entirely, reflect current international research efforts. They will alter as more information becomes available and as genome tools become more sophisticated for each species. It is suggested that this approach could be used to rank diseases from other perspectives as well, e.g. in terms of disease control strategies.","Davies, G; Genini, S; Bishop, S C; Giuffra, E",Animal : an international journal of animal bioscience,596,27

Simulation training may enhance skills, but simulators must be accurate enough for trainees to engage in a realistic way-for example, detection of excessive injection pressure. The soft-embalmed Thiel cadaver is a life-like, durable simulator that is used for dedicated practice and mastery learning training in regional anesthesia. We hypothesized that injection opening pressure in perineural tissue, at epineurium and in subepineurium were similar to opening pressures measured in experimental animals, fresh frozen cadavers, glycol soft-fix cadavers and patients. METHODS We systematically reviewed historical data, then conducted three validation studies delivering a 0.5 mL hydrolocation bolus of embalming fluid and recording injection pressure. First, we delivered the bolus at 12 mL/min at epimysium, perineural tissue, epineurium and in subepineurium at 48 peripheral nerve sites on three cadavers. Second, we delivered the bolus at using three infusion rates: 1 mL/min, 6 mL/min and 12 mL/min on epineurium at 70 peripheral nerve sites on five cadavers. Third, we repeated three injections (12 mL/min) at 24 epineural sites over the median and sciatic nerves of three cadavers. RESULTS Mean (95%) injection pressure was greater at epineurium compared with subepineurium (geometric ratio 1.2 (95% CI: 0.9 to 1.6)), p=0.04, and perineural tissue (geometric ratio 5.1 (95% CI: 3.7 to 7.0)), p<0.0001. Mean (95%) injection pressure was greater at 12 mL/min compared with 1 mL/min (geometric ratio 1.6 (95% CI: 1.2 to 2.1), p=0.005). Pressure measurements were similar in study 3 (p>0.05 for all comparisons).

In Lombardy, the most affected area, the majority of public and private hospitals were dedicated to caring for COVID-19 patients and were organized following the 'Hub-and-Spoke' model for other medical specialties, like cardiac surgery and interventional procedures for congenital cardiac disease (CHD). Here, we report how the congenital cardiac care system was modified in Lombardy and the first results of this organization. METHODS We describe a modified 'Hub-and-Spoke' model - that involves 59 birthplaces and three specialized Congenital Cardiac Centers -- and how the hub center organized his activity. We also reported the data of the consecutive cases hospitalized during this period. RESULTS From 9 March to 15 April, we performed: a total of 21 cardiac surgeries, 4 diagnostic catheterizations, 3 CT scans, and 2 CMR. In three cases with prenatal diagnosis, the birth was scheduled. The spoke centers referred to our center six congenital cardiac cases. The postop ExtraCorporeal Membrane Oxygenation support was required in two cases; one case died. None of these patients nor their parents or accompanying person was found to be COVID-19-positive; 2 pediatric intensivists were found to be COVID-19-positive, and needed hospitalization without mechanical ventilation; 13 nurses had positive COVID swabs (4 with symptoms), and were managed and isolated at home.

Important differences in case fatality rates across the counties did not appear to be reflective of differences in testing or incidence rates. Instead, a higher prevalence of comorbidities and vulnerabilities was observed in high fatality rate counties, while showing no differences in access to acute care.

Therefore, ED is typically linked to a web of closely interrelated cardiovascular risk factors such as physical inactivity, obesity, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome. Physical activity (PA) has proved to be a protective factor against erectile problems, and it has been shown to improve erectile function for men affected by vascular ED. This systematic review estimated the levels of PA needed to decrease ED for men with physical inactivity, obesity, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and/or manifest cardiovascular diseases. AIM To provide recommendations of levels of PA needed to decrease ED for men with physical inactivity, obesity, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and/or cardiovascular diseases. METHODS In accord with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a systematic review was performed of research articles specifically investigating PA as a possible treatment of ED. The review included research on ED from physical inactivity, obesity, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and/or cardiovascular diseases. All available studies from 2006 through 2016 were checked for the predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria to analyze the levels of PA needed to decrease ED. RESULTS 10 articles met the inclusion criteria, all suggesting various levels of PA needed to decrease ED for men with relevant risk factors for ED. The results of the review provided sufficient research evidence for conclusions regarding the levels of PA necessary to decrease ED. CONCLUSION Recommendations of PA to decrease ED should include supervised training consisting of 40 minutes of aerobic exercise of moderate to vigorous intensity 4 times per week. Overall, weekly exercise of 160 minutes for 6 months contributes to decreasing erectile problems in men with ED caused by physical inactivity, obesity, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and/or cardiovascular diseases.

Whereas positive regulation of IFN signaling elicits rapid type I IFNs, negative regulation is equally important in preventing the production of superfluous IFNs that can be hazardous to the host. The positive regulators of IFN pathway are known to be the main targets of viruses to antagonize the innate immune system. Whether viruses target the negative regulators of IFN pathway remains to be fully investigated. In this study, we report that the structural protein VP2 of human Bocavirus modulates IFN pathway by targeting the ring finger protein 125 (RNF125), a negative regulator of type I IFN signaling, which conjugates Lys(48)-linked ubiquitination to retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) and subsequently leads to the proteasome-dependent degradation of RIG-I. VP2 not only upregulated Sendai virus (SeV)-induced IFNB promoter activity, but also enhanced SeV-induced IFN-β production at both mRNA and protein levels. In agreement, the level of Ser(396)-phosphorylated IFN regulatory factor 3 stimulated by SeV was enhanced in the presence of VP2. Furthermore, VP2 was demonstrated to physically interact with RNF125, resulting in the reduction of RNF125-mediated ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of RIG-I. Additional study indicated that endogenous RIG-I degradation was decreased in VP2-expressing cells. Our study delineates a unique phenomenon for aberrant activation of IFN regulatory factor 3 pathway and may represent a new mechanism underlying viral manipulation of the host immune system.","Luo, Huanle; Zhang, Zhenfeng; Zheng, Zhenhua; Ke, Xianliang; Zhang, Xiaowei; Li, Qian; Liu, Yan; Bai, Bingke; Mao, Panyong; Hu, Qinxue; Wang, Hanzhong",Journal of immunology,596,17

A rapid outpatient diagnostic program (RODP) including (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) as a routine diagnostic tool may improve timeliness, however the diagnostic performance of such a combined approach of RODP remains unclear. OBJECTIVES We evaluated timeliness of care and diagnostic performance of FDG-PET and contrast-enhanced CT (FDG-PET/CT) in an RODP for all patients referred with a chest X-ray suspicious of lung cancer. METHODS Charts of patients referred to the 2-day RODP of our tertiary care university clinic after an abnormal chest X-ray between 1999 and 2009 were reviewed. Between 1999 and 2005 co-registered FDG-PET and CT imaging took place; from September 2005 onwards, a hybrid system was used. We analyzed timeliness of care and diagnostic performance of FDG-PET/CT to differentiate malignant from benign lesions. RESULTS In 386 patients available for analysis, 260 were diagnosed with lung cancer and 23 had another type of malignancy; in 78 patients benign disease was confirmed, and in another 45 the diagnosis was not pathologically confirmed but a median 24.5-month follow-up confirmed a benign outcome. Sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values and accuracy of FDG-PET/CT to differentiate lung cancer from benign disease were 97.7, 60.2, 92.5, 84.0 and 85.8%, respectively. Lung cancer patients had a median referral, diagnostic and therapeutic delay of 7, 2 and 19 days, respectively.

There is an urgent need to develop new and safer drugs for these diseases. Protein kinases are a potential class of targets for developing new drugs against NTDs, since they play crucial role in many biological processes, such as signaling pathways, regulating cellular communication, division, metabolism and death. Bioinformatics is a field that aims to organize large amounts of biological data as well as develop and use tools for understanding and analyze them in order to produce meaningful information in a biological manner. In combination with chemogenomics, which analyzes chemical-biological interactions to screen ligands against selected targets families, these approaches can be used to stablish a rational strategy for prioritizing new drug targets for NTDs.

Whether these emerging viruses are associated with increased disease severity is unclear. OBJECTIVES To report the clinical and virological findings of a moderately severe hospital outbreak of A/Victoria/361/2011-like viruses that occurred in November 2011 in Hong Kong. STUDY DESIGN Clinical and virological hospital outbreak investigation. RESULTS The outbreak occurred in an adult psychiatric ward in November 2011, a time well before the usual local seasonal influenza winter peak. Altogether, 7 patients and 1 healthcare-worker were affected (mean age, 47 [range, 34-61] years). The attack rates among patients and healthcare-workers were 33% (7/21) and 7% (1/15), respectively. Pneumonia developed in 38% (3/8) of cases; none had underlying immunocompromised conditions. High nasopharyngeal viral loads were detected. All cases responded to antiviral treatment. Multiple amino acid mutations with reference to earlier A(H3N2) vaccine strains were mapped to key antigenic sites on hemagglutinin; however, no critical mutations on receptor binding sites were detected. Viral sequence variations jeopardized the performance of molecular diagnostic assays. CONCLUSIONS Severe disease and pneumonia occurred in a substantial proportion of non-immunocompromised adults in a hospital outbreak attributed to the emerging antigenically drifted A/Victoria/361/2011-like H3N2 viruses.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the fracture risk associated with NOACs and warfarin. Methods and Results We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception until May 19, 2020. We included studies presenting measurements (regardless of primary/secondary/tertiary/safety outcomes) for any fracture in both NOAC and warfarin users. Two or more reviewers independently screened relevant articles, extracted data, and performed quality assessments. Data were retrieved to synthesize the pooled relative risk (RR) of fractures associated with NOACs versus warfarin. Random-effects models were used for data synthesis. We included 29 studies (5 cohort studies and 24 randomized controlled trials) with 388 209 patients. Patients treated with NOACs had lower risks of fracture than those treated with warfarin (pooled RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.77-0.91; P<0.001) with low heterogeneity (I2=38.9%). NOACs were also associated with significantly lower risks of hip fracture than warfarin (pooled RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.81-0.98; P=0.023). A nonsignificant trend of lower vertebral fracture risk in NOAC users was also observed (pooled RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.54-1.01; P=0.061). Subgroup analyses for individual NOACs demonstrated that dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban were significantly associated with lower fracture risks. Furthermore, the data synthesis results from randomized controlled trials and real-world cohort studies were quite consistent, indicating the robustness of our findings. Conclusions Compared with warfarin, NOACs are associated with lower risks of bone fracture.","Huang, Huei-Kai; Peng, Carol Chiung-Hui; Lin, Shu-Man; Munir, Kashif M; Chang, Rachel Huai-En; Wu, Brian Bo-Chang; Liu, Peter Pin-Sung; Hsu, Jin-Yi; Loh, Ching-Hui; Tu, Yu-Kang",Journal of the American Heart Association,596,1

Pre-existing T cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 has been reported, and a recent study suggested that this was due to cross-recognition of the novel coronavirus by T cells specific for the common cold coronaviruses. METHODS We used the ELISpot assay to characterize the T cell responses against peptide pools derived from the spike protein of three common cold coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-OC43) and SARS-CoV-2 in 21 healthy donors who were seronegative for SARS-CoV-2 and had no known exposure to the virus. An in vitro expansion culture assay was also used to analyze memory T cell responses. RESULTS We found responses to the spike protein of the three common cold coronaviruses in many donors. We then focused on HCoV-NL63 and demonstrated broad T cell responses to the spike protein and identified 22 targeted peptides. Interestingly, only one subject had a significant response to SARS-CoV-2 spike or nucleocapsid protein in the ELISpot assay. In vitro expansion studies suggested that T cells specific for the HCoV-NL63 spike protein in this subject could also recognize SARS-CoV-2 spike protein peptide pools. CONCLUSIONS Healthy donors have circulating T cells specific for the spike proteins of HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43. T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins were present in only one subject and were potentially the result of cross-recognition by T cells specific for the common cold coronaviruses.

However, using ECMO only after failure of IMV exposes patients to the risks of ventilator-induced lung injury. We report a successful outcome using ECMO in the setting of COVID-19 in the absence of IMV failure in an awake, nonintubated patient. This approach may be beneficial for selected patients with COVID-19.","Loyalka, Pranav; Cheema, Faisal H; Rao, Harshit; Rame, J Eduardo; Rajagopal, Keshava",ASAIO journal,596,4

The method is based on the availability of a target-binding nanobody, which is then rigidly attached to two scaffolds: 1) a Fab fragment of an antibody directed against the nanobody and 2) a nanobody-binding protein A fragment fused to maltose binding protein and Fab-binding domains. The overall ensemble of ∼120 kDa, called Legobody, does not perturb the nanobody-target interaction, is easily recognizable in EM images due to its unique shape, and facilitates particle alignment in cryo-EM image processing. The utility of the method is demonstrated for the KDEL receptor, a 23-kDa membrane protein, resulting in a map at 3.2-Å overall resolution with density sufficient for de novo model building, and for the 22-kDa receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, resulting in a map at 3.6-Å resolution that allows analysis of the binding interface to the nanobody. The Legobody approach thus overcomes the current size limitations of cryo-EM analysis.","Wu, Xudong; Rapoport, Tom A",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,596,10

We describe the patient characteristics, program characteristics, and clinical outcomes of patients in our RPM program. METHODS We enrolled COVID-19 patients being discharged home from the hospital. Enrolled patients had an app, and were provided with a pulse oximeter and thermometer. Patients self-reported symptoms, O2 saturation, and temperature daily. Abnormal symptoms or vital signs were flagged and assessed by a pool of nurses. Descriptive statistics were used to describe patient and program characteristics. A mixed-effects logistic regression model was used to determine the odds of a combined endpoint of emergency department (ED) or hospital readmission. RESULTS A total of 295 patients were referred for RPM from five participating hospitals, and 225 patients were enrolled. A majority of enrolled patients (66%) completed the monitoring period without triggering an abnormal alert. Enrollment was associated with a decreased odds of ED or hospital readmission (adjusted odds ratio: 0.54; 95% confidence interval: 0.3-0.97; p = 0.039). Referral without enrollment was not associated with a reduced odds of ED or hospital readmission. CONCLUSION RPM for COVID-19 provides a mechanism to monitor patients in their home environment and reduce hospital utilization. Our work suggests that RPM reduces readmissions for patients with COVID-19 and provides scalable remote monitoring capabilities upon hospital discharge. RPM for postdischarge patients with COVID-19 was associated with a decreased risk of readmission to the ED or hospital, and provided a scalable mechanism to monitor patients in their home environment.","Gordon, William J; Henderson, Daniel; DeSharone, Avital; Fisher, Herrick N; Judge, Jessica; Levine, David M; MacLean, Laura; Sousa, Diane; Su, Mack Y; Boxer, Robert",Applied clinical informatics,596,1

Mouse pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMECs) were used as a model of the microvascular endothelium and were stimulated with LPS. Renal function, renal inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and endothelial NOS (eNOS) expression, cellular apoptosis, plasma and renal levels of NO and reactive oxygen species (ROS), and phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family members (p38, ERK1/2, and JNK1/2) were examined. Moreover, a calpain inhibitor, calpastatin overexpression adenoviruses and MAPK inhibitors were used. Significant renal dysfunction was induced by LPS stimulation, and recovery was observed in TEK/Capn4-/- and Tg-CAST mice but not in LYZ/Capn4-/- mice. Endothelial Capn4 knockout also abrogated the LPS-induced increases in renal iNOS expression, caspase-3 activity and apoptosis and plasma and renal NO and ROS levels but did not obviously affect renal eNOS expression. Moreover, LPS increased both calpain and caspase-3 activity, and only the expression of iNOS in PMECs was accompanied by increased phosphorylation of p38 and JNK. Inhibiting calpain activity or p38 phosphorylation alleviated the increased iNOS expression, NO/ROS production, and cellular apoptosis induced by LPS. These results suggest that endothelial calpain plays a protective role in LPS-induced AKI by inhibiting p38 phosphorylation, thus attenuating iNOS expression and further decreasing NO and ROS overproduction-induced endothelial apoptosis.","Liu, Zhifeng; Ji, Jingjing; Zheng, Dong; Su, Lei; Peng, Tianqing; Tang, Jing",Experimental & molecular medicine,596,19

We hypothesized that the transcriptomic profile might reveal molecular subgroups which could help to define the tumor origin and behavior beyond anatomical location. The gene expression profiles of 107 treatment-naïve, intestinal type, gastroesophageal adenocarcinomas were assessed by the Illumina-HTv4.0 beadchip. Differential gene expression (limma), unsupervised subgroup assignment (mclust) and pathway analysis (gage) were undertaken in R statistical computing and results were related to demographic and clinical parameters. Unsupervised assignment of the gene expression profiles revealed three distinct molecular subgroups, which were not associated with anatomical location, tumor stage or grade (p > 0.05). Group 1 was enriched for pathways involved in cell turnover, Group 2 was enriched for metabolic processes and Group 3 for immune-response pathways. Patients in group 1 showed the worst overall survival (p = 0.019). Key genes for the three subtypes were confirmed by immunohistochemistry. The newly defined intrinsic subtypes were analyzed in four independent datasets of gastric and esophageal adenocarcinomas with transcriptomic data available (RNAseq data: OCCAMS cohort, n = 158; gene expression arrays: Belfast, n = 63; Singapore, n = 191; Asian Cancer Research Group, n = 300). The subgroups were represented in the independent cohorts and pooled analysis confirmed the prognostic effect of the new subtypes. In conclusion, adenocarcinomas at the GEJ comprise three distinct molecular phenotypes which do not reflect anatomical location but rather inform our understanding of the key pathways expressed.","Bornschein, Jan; Wernisch, Lorenz; Secrier, Maria; Miremadi, Ahmad; Perner, Juliane; MacRae, Shona; O'Donovan, Maria; Newton, Richard; Menon, Suraj; Bower, Lawrence; Eldridge, Matthew D; Devonshire, Ginny; Cheah, Calvin; Turkington, Richard; Hardwick, Richard H; Selgrad, Michael; Venerito, Marino; Malfertheiner, Peter; Fitzgerald, Rebecca C",International journal of cancer,596,1

Methods of harnessing this natural pathway are being developed that allow the catalytic degradation of targeted mRNAs using specifically designed complementary small-interfering RNAs (siRNA). siRNAs are being chemically modified to acquire drug-like properties. Numerous recent high profile publications have provided proofs of concept that RNAi may be of therapeutic use. Much of the design of these siRNAs can be accomplished bioinformatically, thus potentially expediting drug discovery and opening new avenues of therapy for many uncommon, orphan, or emerging diseases. Although endogenous human disease targets can theoretically be affected by RNAi therapeutics, nonendogenous targets (eg, viral targets) are attractive and RNAi therapeutics have been shown to act as antivirals in vivo and in vitro. Respiratory viral infections are particularly attractive targets for RNAi therapeutics because the infected cells exist at the air-lung interface, thereby positioning these cells to be accessible to topical administration of siRNA, for example by aerosol. RNAi therapeutics have been shown to be active against respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza and influenza in vitro and in vivo resulting in profound antiviral effects. The first RNAi therapeutic to be designed as an anti-infective medication has now entered proof of concept clinical trials in man. A discussion of the science behind RNAi is followed by a presentation of the potential practical issues in applying this technology to respiratory viral diseases.

COVID19 is an interesting case study because there have been very different outcomes in different localities. These variations are best studied after the fact if precision is the goal; while a pandemic is still unfolding less precise analysis is of value in attempting to guide localities to learn lessons of those that preceded them. Methods: I examine three factors that could differentiate strategy: asymptomatic spread, differences in use of the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) tuberculosis vaccine and cloth face masks. Results: Differences in disease progression as well as the possibility of alternative strategies to prevent COVID-19 from entering the runaway phase or damping it down later can be elucidated by a study of asymptomatic infection. A study to demonstrate not only what fraction are asymptomatic but how contagious they are will also inform policy on universal mask wearing. Conclusions: While a COVID-19 outbreak is at a level that makes accurate trace-and test possible, investigation of asymptomatic transmission is viable and should be attempted to enhance understanding of spread and variability in the disease as well as policy options for slowing the spread.","Machanick, Philip",F1000Research,596,16

Research on the COVID-19 pandemic benefiting from open-access data and machine learning algorithms is still scarce yet can produce relevant and pragmatic information. With country-level pre-COVID-19-pandemic variables, we aimed to cluster countries in groups with shared profiles of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Unsupervised machine learning algorithms (k-means) were used to define data-driven clusters of countries; the algorithm was informed by disease prevalence estimates, metrics of air pollution, socio-economic status and health system coverage. Using the one-way ANOVA test, we compared the clusters in terms of number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, number of deaths, case fatality rate and order in which the country reported the first case. Results: The model to define the clusters was developed with 155 countries. The model with three principal component analysis parameters and five or six clusters showed the best ability to group countries in relevant sets. There was strong evidence that the model with five or six clusters could stratify countries according to the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases (p<0.001). However, the model could not stratify countries in terms of number of deaths or case fatality rate. Conclusions: A simple data-driven approach using available global information before the COVID-19 pandemic, seemed able to classify countries in terms of the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases. The model was not able to stratify countries based on COVID-19 mortality data.","Carrillo-Larco, Rodrigo M; Castillo-Cara, Manuel",Wellcome open research,596,16

Ferroptosis-causing radicals that are targeted by ferroptosis suppressors have not been unequivocally identified. Because certain cytochrome P450 substrate drugs can prevent lipid peroxidation via obscure mechanisms, we evaluated their antiferroptotic potential and used them to identify ferroptosis-causing radicals. METHODS Using a cell-based assay, we screened cytochrome P450 substrate compounds to identify drugs with antiferroptotic activity and investigated the underlying mechanism. To evaluate radical-scavenging activity, we used electron paramagnetic resonance-spin trapping methods and a fluorescence probe for lipid radicals, NBD-Pen, that we had developed. We then assessed the therapeutic potency of these drugs in mouse models of cisplatin-induced AKI and LPS/galactosamine-induced liver injury. RESULTS We identified various US Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs and hormones that have antiferroptotic properties, including rifampicin, promethazine, omeprazole, indole-3-carbinol, carvedilol, propranolol, estradiol, and thyroid hormones. The antiferroptotic drug effects were closely associated with the scavenging of lipid peroxyl radicals but not significantly related to interactions with other radicals. The elevated lipid peroxyl radical levels were associated with ferroptosis onset, and known ferroptosis suppressors, such as ferrostatin-1, also functioned as lipid peroxyl radical scavengers. The drugs exerted antiferroptotic activities in various cell types, including tubules, podocytes, and renal fibroblasts. Moreover, in mice, the drugs ameliorated AKI and liver injury, with suppression of tissue lipid peroxidation and decreased cell death. CONCLUSIONS Although elevated lipid peroxyl radical levels can trigger ferroptosis onset, some drugs that scavenge lipid peroxyl radicals can help control ferroptosis-related disorders, including AKI.","Mishima, Eikan; Sato, Emiko; Ito, Junya; Yamada, Ken-Ichi; Suzuki, Chitose; Oikawa, Yoshitsugu; Matsuhashi, Tetsuro; Kikuchi, Koichi; Toyohara, Takafumi; Suzuki, Takehiro; Ito, Sadayoshi; Nakagawa, Kiyotaka; Abe, Takaaki",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,596,19

With this study we sought to find a mathematical explanation for this negative correlation between dose and effect, to confirm its existence with additional clinical data and to explore it further with Monte Carlo simulations. Automatically recorded dosing and effect data from more than 9'000 patients was available for the analysis. The anesthetics propofol and sevoflurane and the catecholamine nor-epinephrine were titrated to defined effect targets, i.e., the processed electroencephalogram (BIS) and the blood pressure. A proportional control titration algorithm was developed for the simulations. We prove by deduction that the average dose effect relationship during titration to the targeted effect will associate lower doses with greater effects. The finding of negative correlations between propofol and BIS, sevoflurane and BIS and norepinephrine and mean arterial pressure confirmed the titration paradox. Monte Carlo simulations revealed two additional factors that contribute to the paradox. During stepwise titration toward a target effect, the slope of the dose effect data for the population will be `reversed,' i.e., the correlation between dose and effect will not be positive, but will be negative, and will be `horizontal' when the titration is `perfect.' The titration paradox must be considered whenever data from clinical titration (flexible dose) studies is interpreted. Such data should not be used naively for the development of dosing guidelines.","Schnider, Thomas W; Minto, Charles F; Filipovic, Miodrag",Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,596,1

METHODS Single-center prospective cohort study including data from kidney transplant recipients with confirmed COVID-19 between 03/20/2020 and 07/31/2020. Outcomes were adjudicated until 08/31/2020 or the date of death. RESULTS There were 491 patients with COVID-19 among the 11 875 recipients in follow-up. The majority was middle-aged with 1 or more comorbidities. Thirty-one percent were treated at home, 69% required hospitalization. Among the hospitalized, 61% needed intensive care, 75% presented allograft dysfunction and 46% needed dialysis. Overall 28-day fatality rate was 22% and, among hospitalized patients, 41%. Age (OR 3.08, 95%CI 1.86-5.09), diabetes mellitus (OR 1.69, 95%CI 1.06-2.72), and cardiac disease (OR 2.00, 95%CI 1.09-3.68) were independent factors for death.

Seroconversion was observed in 79% of the survivors and was associated with disease severity. Persistence of viral shedding was observed in 21% of the patients without detectable clinical implications. CONCLUSIONS This prospective cohort analysis confirms the high 28-days fatality rate of COVID-19, associated primarily with age and comorbidities. The high incidence of allograft dysfunction was associated with a wide range of specific histologic lesions and high rates of sequelae and graft loss. Seroconversion was high and the persistence of viral shedding deserves further studies.","Cristelli, Marina P; Viana, Laila A; Dantas, Marcus T C; Martins, Suelen B S; Fernandes, Ruan; Nakamura, Monica R; Santos, Daniel W C L; Taddeo, Julia B; Azevedo, Vega F; Foresto, Renato D; Tedesco-Silva, Helio; Medina-Pestana, Jose",Transplantation,596,1

Over 5 million COVID-19 cases and approximately 330,000 deaths have been recorded worldwide. Transmission is primarily spread through direct, indirect (through contaminated objects or surfaces), or close contact with infected people via respiratory droplets, the mouth, and/or nose secretions. Health care professionals (HCPs), including dental HCPs, are recognized to be at considerably high risk for infection due to the close proximity to patients and aerosol-generating procedures. During pregnancy, HCPs may be at even higher risk since pregnancy substantially increases the susceptibility to infectious diseases. OBJECTIVES Here, we present the posed risks and potential effects of COVID-19 on maternal and fetal health. Current prevention and management strategies for COVID-19 on pregnant dental and HCPs are also discussed. RESULTS Significant progress is being made in understanding the pathogenesis and clinical consequences of COVID-19. Pregnant women are affected more adversely with viral illnesses, although evidence of vertical transmission of COVID-19 is controversial. Based on the presence of atypical symptoms, the significant numbers of asymptomatic individuals who are COVID-19 positive, and the high susceptibility to viral diseases observed in pregnant women, recommendations have been put forth to limit the exposure of COVID-19-positive or even suspected cases to pregnant HCPs, and these are likely to evolve as new information becomes available. CONCLUSION Pregnant HCPs require extra caution: not only are they considered a high-risk population, but their work at the frontline in a pandemic may expose them to additional risks. Complete awareness of the effects of COVID-19 on maternal and fetal/infant health, as well as prevention and management guidelines for pregnant HCPs, will allow for a safer work environment. Health care institutional policies aimed at protecting pregnant HCPs should consider avoiding their assignment as first responders, especially if equally trained staff are available. KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER STATEMENT Dental and health care professionals can use the information in this review to improve their awareness of COVID-19 risks, signs, and symptoms and the associated effects on the health of pregnant health care professionals and their unborn/newborn children.","Mann, A; Dahiya, A; Souza, L C; Letra, A",JDR clinical and translational research,596,29

Despite being found diversely in male gametes (e.g., Plasmodium falciparum microgametocytes and human and Drosophila melanogaster sperm), very little is known about cytoplasmic cilia assembly. Here, we show that a novel RNP granule containing the mRNAs for axonemal dynein motor proteins becomes highly polarized to the distal end of the cilia during cytoplasmic ciliogenesis in Drosophila sperm. This allows for the incorporation of these axonemal dyneins into the axoneme directly from the cytoplasm, possibly by localizing translation. We found that this RNP granule contains the proteins Reptin and Pontin, loss of which perturbs granule formation and prevents incorporation of the axonemal dyneins, leading to sterility. We propose that cytoplasmic cilia assembly requires the precise localization of mRNAs encoding key axonemal constituents, allowing these proteins to incorporate efficiently into the axoneme.","Fingerhut, Jaclyn M; Yamashita, Yukiko M",The Journal of cell biology,596,31

Eplerenone 50 mg/kg/day was administered orally to the eplerenone group. Pathological changes to the hippocampal formation, plasma and encephalic aldosterone, and plasma potassium levels were compared among the groups.After 10 weeks, rats in the eplerenone and SHR groups showed higher systolic BP (p = .01) than the control group. Aldosterone levels in the brain were higher in the SHR group (0.20 ± 0.06 pg/ml) than in the eplerenone (0.14 ± 0.05 pg/ml, p = .044) or control (0.12 ± 0.07 pg/ml, p = .007) groups. Plasma aldosterone levels in the SHR group were 1.7 times higher than those in the control group (p = .006). Cerebral cortex was thinner in the SHR group (225.18 ± 15.43 μm) than in the eplerenone (240.38 ± 12.85 μm, p < .01) or control (244.72 ± 18.92 μm, p < .01) groups. Thickness did not differ between the latter two groups. The SHR group exhibited apoptotic cells in the hippocampal formation, which were rare in the eplerenone and control groups. Plasma potassium levels were higher in the eplerenone group than those in the other two groups (p < .05).Our results showed that eplerenone can alleviate brain damage (thinning of cortex and increased apoptosis) caused by aldosterone in a rat model of hypertension.","Wang, Xue; Zhu, Yuhai; Wang, Shuanglin; Wang, Zhuoqun; Sun, Haonan; He, Yujie; Yao, Wei",Clinical and experimental hypertension,596,27

Our experiments and theoretical predictions show that the swimming speed of IRONSperms exceeds 0.2 body length/s (6.8 ± 4.1 µm/s) at an actuation frequency of 8 Hz and precision angle of 45°. We demonstrate that the nanoparticle coating increases the acoustic impedance of the sperm cells and enables localization of clusters of IRONSperm using ultrasound feedback.

The most impressive study of mechanical ventilation to date is the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Network study of higher versus lower tidal volume (V(T)), which reported a reduction in mortality from 39.8% to 31.0% with 6 mL/kg ideal body weight rather than 12 mL/kg ideal body weight (number-needed-to-treat of 12 patients). To achieve optimal lung protection, the lowest plateau pressure and V(T) possible should be selected. What is most important is limitation of V(T) and alveolar distending pressure, regardless of the mode set on the ventilator. Accumulating observational evidence suggests that V(T) should be limited in all mechanically ventilated patients-even those who do not have ALI/ARDS. Evidence does not support the use of pressure controlled inverse-ratio ventilation. Although zero PEEP is probably injurious, an area of considerable controversy is the optimal setting of PEEP. Available evidence does not support the use of higher PEEP, compared to lower PEEP, in unselected patients with acute lung injury (ALI)/ARDS. However, results of a meta-analysis using individual patients from 3 randomized controlled trials suggest that higher PEEP should be used for ARDS, whereas lower PEEP may be more appropriate in patients with ALI. PEEP should be set to maximize alveolar recruitment while avoiding over-distention. Many approaches for setting PEEP have been described, but evidence is lacking that any one approach is superior to any other. In most, if not all, cases of ALI/ARDS, conventional ventilation strategies can be used effectively to provide lung-protective ventilation strategies.","Hess, Dean R",Respiratory care,596,5

The purpose of our study was to analyze 3 commercially available ultrasonic energy devices; the Sonicision (SC), the Harmonic ACE (HA), and the THUNDERBEAT (TB). MATERIAL AND METHODS Eight female Yorkshire pigs were used for data collection and vessel harvest. Three devices were evaluated and compared with each other with respect to seal failure and cutting speed in vivo. After vessel harvest, one end of the fragment was sent for histological evaluation, and the other was used for burst pressure measurement testing in a blinded fashion. The coagulation and cut levels of all the generators were set up at a similar and constant level. RESULTS Eighty-four vessels (47 arteries and 37 veins) were tested. Mean vessel diameter was equal among the groups. Cutting speed was significantly faster with TB (3.4 ± 0.7 seconds) than SC or HA (5.8 ± 2.4 and 6.1 ± 3.1 seconds; P < .0001). Burst pressure trended higher after ligation with TB (505.4 ± 349.4 mm Hg) than SC and HA (435.8 ± 403.0 and 437.6 ± 291.3 mm Hg). There were 2 seal failures in the SC group and HA group and none in the TB group. Histologically, the perpendicular width of tissue seal with TB (1.250 ± 0.55 mm) was significantly longer than that of the SC and the HA (0.772 ± 0.23 and 0.686 ± 0.23 mm; P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS TB has proven to provide the most rapid and reliable seal. Therefore, TB may be safer and may decrease time during surgical procedures.","Tanaka, Ryota; Gitelis, Matthew; Meiselman, Danny; Abar, Bijan; Zapf, Matthew; Carbray, JoAnn; Vigneswaran, Yalini; Zhao, Jin-Cheng; Ujiki, Michael",Surgical innovation,596,1

We hypothesized that this variable outcome could correlate with the nature of responses made to previous microbes. To test this, mice were infected initially with influenza A virus (IAV) and in memory phase challenged with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), which we show in this study to have relatively minor cross-reactivity with IAV. The outcome in genetically identical mice varied from mild pneumonitis to severe acute lung injury with extensive pneumonia and bronchiolization, similar to that observed in patients who died of the 1918 H1N1 pandemic. Lesion expression did not correlate with virus titers. Instead, disease severity directly correlated with and was predicted by the frequency of IAV-PB1703- and IAV-PA224-specific responses, which cross-reacted with LCMV-GP34 and LCMV-GP276, respectively. Eradication or functional ablation of these pathogenic memory T cell populations, using mutant-viral strains, peptide-based tolerization strategies, or short-term anti-IFN-γ treatment, inhibited severe lesions such as bronchiolization from occurring. Heterologous immunity can shape outcome of infections and likely individual responses to vaccination, and can be manipulated to treat or prevent severe pathology.","Wlodarczyk, Myriam F; Kraft, Anke R; Chen, Hong D; Kenney, Laurie L; Selin, Liisa K",Journal of immunology,596,1

Because of clinical rarity, several small case reports have been published and there is a lack of large sample study. Preoperative definite diagnosis is difficult. Although definite treatment for ICUE is radical surgical resection, surgical decision in operative field is difficult. CASE PRESENTATION A 77-year-old man came to the emergency department with complaints of a 1-day history of abdominal pain and abdominal distension. Abdominal computed tomography revealed ileus and focal free air. Laparotomy revealed multiple small bowel tiny perforations in the ileum. The serosa surface in the whole small bowel had small multiple yellowish tiny discolored lesions. Despite the presence of multiple mucosal ulcers in entire small bowel, the ileum including perforation site was resected segmentally. Microscopically, mucosal ulcers in resected small bowel demonstrated transmural inflammation, no granuloma, and no lymphoid aggregates. These features were consistent with a diagnosis of ICUE with panenteritis and perforation. After surgery, the patient's general condition gradually aggravated. Unfortunately, the patient died of multiple organ failure on post-operative day 14. CONCLUSION Surgically, the decision including resection range, anastomosis or enterotomy becomes difficult in ICUE with panenteritis. According to recent 40 year's revised data, the post-operative mortality of ICUE is about 53.4%. Although ICUE is rare, its recognition is important for appropriate diagnosis and treatment.

The most commonly used technique to achieve conditional gene inactivation employs the Cre/loxP system and its ability to delete DNA sequences flanked by two loxP sites. However, targeting a gene with two loxP sites is time and labor consuming. Here, we show Cre-Controlled CRISPR (3C) mutagenesis to circumvent these issues. 3C relies on gRNA and Cre-dependent Cas9-GFP expression from the same transgene. Exogenous or transgenic supply of Cre results in Cas9-GFP expression and subsequent mutagenesis of the gene of interest. The recombined cells become fluorescently visible enabling their isolation and subjection to various omics techniques. Hence, 3C mutagenesis provides a valuable alternative to the production of loxP-flanked alleles. It might even enable the conditional inactivation of multiple genes simultaneously and should be applicable to other model organisms amenable to single integration transgenesis.","Hans, Stefan; Zöller, Daniela; Hammer, Juliane; Stucke, Johanna; Spieß, Sandra; Kesavan, Gokul; Kroehne, Volker; Eguiguren, Juan Sebastian; Ezhkova, Diana; Petzold, Andreas; Dahl, Andreas; Brand, Michael",Nature communications,596,1

Previous studies demonstrated an impairment of the presynaptic catecholamine reuptake as assessed by (123)I-labeled norepinephrine analog on metaiodobenzylguanidine ((123)I-MIBG) SPECT. Mutations in the gene encoding for plakophilin-2 (PKP-2) are the most common cause of autosomal dominant ARVC (ARVC-9). In this study, we investigated the potential role of adrenergic dysfunction on the arrhythmia profile in patients with ARVC and correlated these findings with the causative genotype. METHODS (123)I-MIBG SPECT was performed for 42 patients with definite ARVC (10 women, 32 men; mean age ± SD, 43 ± 14 y). Images were acquired at 4 h after injection and analyzed for regional (123)I-MIBG uptake in a standardized 33-segment polar map. Results were compared with those obtained from 10 control subjects (5 women, 5 men; mean age ± SD, 43 ± 12 y). RESULTS An abnormal tracer uptake was detected in 25 patients with ARVC (59%). The extents of right ventricular dilation and regional wall motion abnormalities as well as electrocardiographic markers of de- or repolarization were not significantly different between patients with normal and abnormal (123)I-MIBG SPECT findings. However, during long-term follow-up of 11.9 ± 4.1 y, patients with abnormal (123)I-MIBG SPECT findings experienced life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias significantly more often (22/25 patients [88%]) and independent of the extent of right ventricular dysfunction than those with a normal sympathetic innervation (6/17 patients [35%]; P < 0.0005). Mutations in PKP-2 were identified in 17 patients (40%) but were not correlated with the degree of adrenergic dysfunction. CONCLUSION In patients with ARVC, an impairment of adrenergic innervation independent of the underlying genotype is associated with a higher incidence for future recurrences of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. This finding may suggest a potential role of (123)I-MIBG SPECT for individualized risk stratification in ARVC patients and asymptomatic PKP-2 mutation carriers alike.","Paul, Matthias; Wichter, Thomas; Kies, Peter; Gerss, Joachim; Wollmann, Christian; Rahbar, Kambiz; Eckardt, Lars; Breithardt, Günter; Schober, Otmar; Schulze-Bahr, Eric; Schäfers, Michael","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",596,26

We report the discovery and characterization of small-molecule inhibitors of SARS-CoV replication that block viral entry by three different mechanisms. The compounds were discovered by screening a chemical library of compounds for blocking of entry of HIV-1 pseudotyped with SARS-CoV surface glycoprotein S (SARS-S) but not that of HIV-1 pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus surface glycoprotein G (VSV-G). Studies on their mechanisms of action revealed that the compounds act by three distinct mechanisms: (i) SSAA09E2 {N-[[4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)phenyl]methyl]-1,2-oxazole-5-carboxamide} acts through a novel mechanism of action, by blocking early interactions of SARS-S with the receptor for SARS-CoV, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2); (ii) SSAA09E1 {[(Z)-1-thiophen-2-ylethylideneamino]thiourea} acts later, by blocking cathepsin L, a host protease required for processing of SARS-S during viral entry; and (iii) SSAA09E3 [N-(9,10-dioxo-9,10-dihydroanthracen-2-yl)benzamide] also acts later and does not affect interactions of SARS-S with ACE2 or the enzymatic functions of cathepsin L but prevents fusion of the viral membrane with the host cellular membrane. Our work demonstrates that there are at least three independent strategies for blocking SARS-CoV entry, validates these mechanisms of inhibition, and introduces promising leads for the development of SARS therapeutics.","Adedeji, Adeyemi O; Severson, William; Jonsson, Colleen; Singh, Kamalendra; Weiss, Susan R; Sarafianos, Stefan G",Journal of virology,596,7

Knowledge of pre-COVID-19 trends in this gap is needed to assess the longer-term impacts of the pandemic. We provide evidence for England on recent trends in 1, 2 and 3-year mortality amongst care home residents aged 65+ compared with similar community-dwelling residents. We use the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, a nationally representative primary care database. For each of the ten years from 2006 to 2015, care home and community-dwelling residents aged 65+ were identified and matched in the ratio 1:3, according to age, gender, area deprivation and region. Cox survival analyses were used to estimate mortality risks for care home residents in comparison with similar community-dwelling people, adjusting for age, gender, area deprivation and region. The study sample consisted of ten overlapping cohorts averaging 5495 care home residents per cohort. Adjusted mortality risks increased over the study period for care home residents while decreasing slightly for matched community-dwelling residents. The relative risks (RRs) of mortality associated with care home residence were higher for younger ages and shorter follow-up periods, in all years. Over the decade, the RRs increased, most at younger ages and for shorter follow-up periods (e.g. for the age group 65-74 years, 1-year average RR increased by 61% from 5.4 to 8.8, while for those aged 85-94 years and over, 3-year RR increased by 22% from 1.3 to 1.6). Thus the survival gap between older care home and community-dwelling residents has been widening, especially at younger ages. In due course, it will be possible to establish to what extent the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in further growth in this gap.","Espuny Pujol, Ferran; Hancock, Ruth; Morciano, Marcello",Social science & medicine,596,1

METHOD Online databases were searched for articles published before or on 22 June 2020. Studies reporting the effectiveness and safety of antiviral agents for COVID-19 were analysed. RESULTS A total of 42 studies were included in this analysis. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was not associated with the incidence of death (risk ratio (RR)=1.08; 95% CI 0.81 to 1.44) and severe cases (RR=1.05; 95% CI 0.61 to 1.81). Patients treated with HCQ obtained few benefits with respect to the clearance of viral RNA and were more likely to have adverse reactions. HCQ treatment could shorten the body temperature recovery time (weighted mean difference = -1.04; 95% CI -1.64 to -0.45).

Methods: By means of Weibull, Gamma and Lognormal distributions methods, we estimated the probability distribution of the incubation period and generation interval data obtained from the reported COVID-19 cases. Moreover, the AIC criterion was used to determine the optimal distribution. Considering the epidemic is ongoing, the exponential growth model was used to fit the incidence data of COVID-19 from 10 to 31 January, 2020, and exponential growth method, maximum likelihood method and SEIR model were used to estimate the basic reproduction number. Results: Early COVID-19 cases kept an increase in exponential growth manner before 26 January, 2020, then the increase trend became slower. The average incubation period was 5.01 (95%CI: 4.31-5.69) days; the average generation interval was 6.03 (95%CI: 5.20-6.91) days. The basic reproduction number was estimated to be 3.74 (95%CI: 3.63-3.87), 3.16 (95%CI: 2.90-3.43), and 3.91 (95%CI: 3.71-4.11) by three methods, respectively. Conclusions: The Gamma distribution fits both the generation interval and incubation period best, and the mean value of generation interval is 1.02 day longer than that of incubation period. The relatively high basic reproduction number indicates that the epidemic is still serious; Based on our analysis, the turning point of the epidemic would be seen on 26 January, the growth rate would be lower afterwards.","Song, Q Q; Zhao, H; Fang, L Q; Liu, W; Zheng, C; Zhang, Y",Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,596,8

This includes disruption to the healthcare system that supports a disaster-affected community. Nurses are important members of disaster response teams. However, there is limited literature that describes nurses’ roles or experience in responding to disasters. Aim This paper employs a phenomenological approach to uncover moments of being an Australian civilian hospital nurse in the out-of-hospital environment following a disaster. Method This study uncovers moments of what it is like being an Australian civilian hospital nurse deployed to the out-of-hospital environment following a disaster. Individual interviews were undertaken at two points in time with each participant. Audio-recorded interviews were transcribed to textual narratives, which was then analysed. Several activities were undertaken to uncover moments and provide exemplars of moments, from the narrative. Findings Eight hospital nurses participated in this study. Five moments were uncovered: ‘on the way to a disaster’, ‘prior to starting work’, ‘working a shift in a disaster’, ‘end of a shift’, and ‘returning home’. Each moment has its uniqueness and singularity exemplifying an experience of nurses in the out-of-hospital disaster environment. Discussion When compared to a hospital context, assisting during and/or following a disaster in the out-of-hospital environment is challenging. For example, nurses may need to do more with less resources, provide more frequent psychosocial support for more extenuating circumstances, and experience an unsettling return home at the end of the deployment. Conclusions This paper has provided new insights into what it may be like being an Australian civilian hospital nurse in the out-of-hospital disaster environment as part of a disaster medical assistance teams. Strategies to support nurses who assist during and/or following a disaster are important, so nurses can in turn provide care to people in disaster-affected communities.","Ranse, Jamie Arbon Paul Cusack Lynette Shaban Ramon Z.",Collegian,596,1

The simultaneous infection of a single individual by two distinct SARS-CoV-2 lineages provides a window of opportunity for viral recombination and the emergence of new lineages with differential phenotype. Several hundred SARS-CoV-2 lineages are currently well characterized but two main factors have precluded major coinfection/codetection analysis thus far: i) the low diversity of SARS-CoV-2 lineages during the first year of the pandemic which limited the identification of lineage defining mutations necessary to distinguish coinfecting viral lineages; and the ii) limited availability of raw sequencing data where abundance and distribution of intrasample/intrahost variability can be accessed. Here, we have put together a large sequencing dataset from Brazilian samples covering a period of 18 May 2020 to 30 April 2021 and probed it for unexpected patterns of high intrasample/intrahost variability. It enabled us to detect nine cases of SARS-CoV-2 coinfection with well characterized lineage-defining mutations. In addition, we matched these SARS-CoV-2 coinfections with spatio-temporal epidemiological data confirming their plausibility with the co-circulating lineages at the timeframe investigated. These coinfections represent around 0.61% of all samples investigated. Although our data suggests that coinfection with distinct SARS-CoV-2 lineages is a rare phenomenon, it is likely an underestimation and coinfection rates warrants further investigation.","Dezordi, F.

In the case of natural disasters the effects on public health can be direct or indirect. Direct effects are defined as those resulting from the immediate destruction such as drowning and trauma from flying debris, while indirect effects are delayed, longer lasting, and, often harder to measure or detect. In the case of outbreaks and epidemics, lack of comprehensive testing or reporting can lead to challenges in measuring direct effects, while indirect effects can arise due to, for example, increased stress levels or reduced access to health services. When the effects are long lasting and difficult to detect in the short term, the accumulated effects can actually be devastating. Improved access to mortality data provides an opportunity to develop data-driven approaches that can help monitor health systems and quantify the effects of natural disasters, epidemics, or outbreaks. Here we describe a statistical methodology and software that facilitates data-driven approaches. Our work was motivated by events occurring in Puerto Rico after the passage of Hurricane Maria, but can be applied in other contexts such as estimating the effects of an epidemic in the presence of inaccurate reporting of cases. We demonstrate the utility of our tools by applying it to data related to six hurricanes and data related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We also searched for other unusual events during the last 35 years in Puerto Rico. We demonstrate that the effects of hurricanes in Puerto Rico are substantially worse than in other states, that the 2014 Chikungunya outbreak resulted in an unusually high mortality rate in Puerto Rico, that in the United States the excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic already exceeded 100,000 on May 9, 2020, and that the effects of this pandemic was worse for elderly black individuals compared to whites of the same age.

The SUN would streamline the patient from the ward to the outpatient (OPD) recovery area, taking an early independent decision regarding failure of TWOC and subsequent discharge. This enables an improved turnover during the limited and stringent service availability during the peak and post COVID era.MethodsA dual design (retrospective and prospective) pilot study was performed. The length of inpatient stay following a TWOC for a TURP between June and August 2019 were analysed as current service practice. This was compared with a pilot scheme involving recruitment to a streamlined Post-TURP pathway that was implemented across 2 months in 2020.ResultsThirty eight patients were identified in the original service evaluation in 2019. The mean and median time patients waited prior to discharge with or without a catheter was 11.5 and 9 hours respectively. Six patients had an additional overnight stay due to late decision making on success of TWOC.Thirteen patients in the pilot scheme were recruited, transferred to the OPD recovery area had a mean and median stay of 6.5 and 7 hours respectively in the hospital after their catheter removal. A median number of 3.5 hours of inpatient bed stay was saved.ConclusionThe role of the SUN can improve resource allocation by freeing precious elective surgical beds. Additionally improves patient experience by shorter length of stay in hospital following a TWOC.

Additionally, the purpose is to detect misinformation and extremism, not only to help online social networks (OSN) to target such content more rapidly but also to provide a close to real-time picture of trending topics, misinformation, and extremism flowing on OSN. This could help authorities to identify the intents behind them and find out how and when they should address such content. Design/methodology/approach: This study focuses on extracting and verifying knowledge from large-scale OSN data, at the intersection of the Coronavirus pandemic and the US 2020 presidential election. More specifically, this study makes manual, statistical and automatic inferences and extracts knowledge from over a million Tweets related to the two aforementioned major events. On the other hand, disinformation operations intensified in 2020 with the coincidence of the Coronavirus pandemic and presidential election. This study applies machine learning to detect misinformation and extreme opinions on OSN. Over one million Tweets have been collected by our server in real-time from the beginning of April 2020 to the end of January 2021, using six keywords, namely, Covid, Corona, Trump, Biden, Democrats and Republicans. These Tweets are inspected with regard to their topics, opinions, news, and political affiliation, along with misinformation and extremism. Findings: Our analyses showed that the majority of these Tweets concern death tolls, testing, mask, drugs, vaccine, and travel bans. The second concern among these Tweets is reopening the economy and schools, unemployment, and stimulus bills. The third concern is related to the Coronavirus pandemic’s impacts on politics, voting, and misinformation. This highlights the topics that US voters on Twitter were most concerned about during this time period, among the multitude of other topics that politicians and news media were reporting or discussing. Automatic classification of these Tweets using a long short-term memory network revealed that Tweets containing misinformation formed between 0.5% and 1.1% of Coronavirus-related Tweets every month and Tweets containing extreme opinions formed between 0.5% and 3.1% of them every month, with its pick in October 2020, coinciding with the US presidential election month.

There is limited data on survivability after inhospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), particularly in rural and resource-limited settings. In this study, we describe the characteristics and outcomes for COVID-19 patients suffering IHCA at a rural hospital in Southern California. Methods: This was a single-center retrospective observational study performed at a rural situated community hospital in Southern California. A hospital registry of COVID-19 patients was queried for all patients who suffered IHCA and received cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) between May 1st 2020 and July 31st 2020. A manual chart review was performed to confirm cardiac arrest (CA), COVID-19 positivity, as well as to obtain patient demographics, medical comorbidities, COVID-19 specific therapies administered, oxygen requirement prior to CA, details of the resuscitation, and final disposition. Results: We identified twenty one patients who suffered IHCA and received CPR. The majority of these patients were Hispanic, male, and aged 50-70, and the most common medical comorbidities were diabetes and hypertension. Many patients received COVID-19 specific therapies, including dexamethasone, remdesivir, or convalescent plasma. 20/21 patients suffered respiratory arrest, with an initial rhythm of pulseless electrical activity or asystole. Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was achieved in 3/9 patients already receiving mechanical ventilation, but all 3 expired within the following 24 hours. ROSC was achieved in 10/12 patients not already intubated, though most also expired within a few days. The only 2 patients who survived to discharge suffered respiratory arrest after their oxygen delivery dislodged. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first study of COVID-19 cardiac arrests specifically in a rural setting in the United States. In this study at a small community hospital with limited resources and a predominantly Hispanic population, we found low survivability after IHCA in COVID-19 patients. While more is being learned about the disease, and treatment modalities are improving, cardiac arrest portends an extremely poor prognosis. A better appreciation of these outcomes should help inform providers and patients when discussing code status and attempts at resuscitation, particularly in resource limited settings.","Nene, R.

Materials and methods. Weekly online queries from Yandex Russian users regarding smell impairment were analysed in regions and large cities of Russia from 16/3/2020 to 21/2/2021. A total of 81 regions of Russia and several large cities, such as Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Nizhny Novgorod, were included in the study. Results. A strong positive direct correlation (r>0.7) was found between the number of smell-related queries in Yandex new cases of COVID-19 in 59 out of 85 Russian regions and large cities (70%). During the ""first"" peak of COVID-19 incidence in Russia (April-May 2020), the increase in the number of smell-related queries outpaced the increase in the number of new cases by 1-2 weeks in 23 out of 59 regions of Russia.

Meanwhile, Latino vaccination rates remain lower than those of non-Hispanic Whites. COVID-19 vaccine nonintent, defined as intent not to vaccinate for COVID-19, among Latino individuals continues to be an issue in the state of California. Methods: Families from three Latino longitudinal mother child cohorts previously recruited in the San Francisco Bay Area were surveyed telephonically from February to July 2021 to assess attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination and prior vaccination, in general, for themselves and their children. Risk for vaccine nonintent was assessed using Mann-Whitney rank sum non-parametric test for continuous predictors and chi-squared tests for categorical ones. Results: Three hundred and eighteen families were surveyed from the Telomere at Birth (TAB), Hispanic Eating and Nutrition (HEN) and Latino Eating and Diabetes Cohort (LEAD). Approximately 36% from TAB and 28% from HEN/LEAD indicated COVID-19 vaccine nonintent for themselves and/or their children. Risk factors for vaccine nonintent included lower maternal age (p=0.01), concern about vaccine side effects (p<0.01) and prior history of a household members being infected with COVID-19 (p<0.01) and indexes of household crowding including number of people sharing a bathroom (p=0.048). Vaccine intent was also associated with receiving vaccine input from friends (p=0.03), family (p<0.01) and/or coworkers (p=0.02) compared with those who were not planning on getting COVID-19 vaccination.

Previous work established a method capable of reconstructing 3D movies and accompanying energetics of atomic-level structures from single-particle cryo-EM images of macromolecules displaying multiple conformational degrees of freedom. Here, we introduce an unsupervised geometric machine learning approach that is informed by detailed heuristic analysis of manifolds formed by simulated heterogeneous cryo-EM datasets generated from an atomic structure. These simulated data were generated with increasing complexity to account for multiple conformational motions, state occupancies and typical microscope parameters in a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios. Using these datasets as ground-truth, we provide detailed exposition of our findings using several conformational motions while exploring the available parameter space. Guided by these insights, we build a framework to leverage the high-dimensional geometric information obtained towards reconstituting a quasi-continuum of conformational states in the form of a free-energy landscape and respective 3D density maps for all states therein. As shown by a direct comparison of results, this framework offers substantial improvements relative to the previous work.","Seitz, Evan; Acosta-Reyes, Francisco; Maji, Suvrajit; Schwander, Peter; Frank, Joachim",bioRxiv,596,22

The main idea is that despite the primary damage to the respiratory tract,SARS-CoV-2 can be attributed to a number of signs as neurotropic viruses, which is ultimately realized by the transport of the pathogen COVID-19 from the place of primary localization — the respiratory tract to the human brain. The virus is capable of hitting all possible pathways of being transferred through tissues and within a short time appears in the brain, interacting with ACE2 receptors and co-receptors, which are expressed in almost all brain cells, neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microgliocytes, which carry out the main functional tasks of the brain. The clinical part is devoted to radiation diagnosis of lesions of the nervous system caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Analysis of the literature has made it possible to identify radiation variants of CNS lesions in COVID-19, illustrating the main clinical manifestations of the disease. There are several main clinical and morphological variants of CNS damage in COVID-19 [1]: acute ischemic stroke, acute encephalopathy, due to massive diffuse damage to the endothelium against the background of vasculitis / endotheliitis, occurring both with and without signs of cerebral artery thrombosis, hemorrhages, primarily of the type of small petechiae, polyetiologic in nature (endothelial damage, acute hypoxia, microembolism). In addition, hemorrhages can be a consequence of venous infarction against the background of sinus thrombosis. Radiological methods can diagnose multi-step lesions of the supra-and subtentorial white matter, vasculitis, in particular Susak’s syndrome, posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy — PRES, leukoencephalopathy, delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy, Miller–Fischer’s polyneuropathy (Guillain-Barre syndrome), syndrome. © 2021, HIV Infection and Immunosuppressive Disorders.

No study has been published about the titer of Sars-Cov-2 antibodies in non-infected patients with autoimmune disease. Objectives: To evaluate the titer of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in non-COVID-19 patients and compare it between systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients and healthy controls (HC). Methods: A total of 58 patients with SSc (who fulfilled ACR/EULAR 2013 SSc classification criteria) and 18 HC were enrolled. Sera of all participants were collected, and SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgG and IgM) were evaluated by means ELISA. In all participants swabs for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assay were reported negative. Demographic, clinical, and autoimmune serological characteristics of SSc patients were recorded. The normal distribution was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk's test. Exclusion criteria was previous or actual Sars-Cov-2 infection. Comparisons between study groups of patients were evaluated by the Student's t-test or Mann -Whitney U-test as appropriate. The differences between categorial variables were assessed by Pearson chi-square or Fisher's exact test, as opportune. Statistical significance was set at p ≤ 0.05. Results: We observed significant differences between SSc patients and HC in serum levels of Sars-Cov-2 antibodies (IgG: 1,4±2,1 AU/ml vs 0,36±0,19 AU/ml respectively (p=0,001);and IgM: 2,5±3,1 AU/ml vs 0,8±0,7 AU/ml (p=0,022)). In 5 SSc patients was found titer of Sars-Cov-2 antibodies (IgG) exceeding the cut-off, but the control of swabs for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assay were negative. No significative differences in Sars-Cov-2 autoantibodies titer were found in subgroup of SSc patients with or without ILD or PAH, limited or diffuse skin subset, and different autoantibodies profile. Furthermore, antibodies titer was not associated with different drugs (steroid, methotrexate, mofetil-mycophenolate and bosentan) in use. Conclusion: A cross mimicking between Sars-Cov-2 antibodies and antinuclear antibodies or anti ENA could be hypothesized.

The present study aims at assessing the COVID-19 pandemic impacts on agricultural labor and suggesting strategies to mitigate them. To this end, after an introduction to the pandemic background, the negative consequences on agriculture and the existing mitigation policies, risks to the agricultural workers were benchmarked across the United States’ Standard Occupational Classification system. The individual tasks associated with each occupation in agricultural production were evaluated on the basis of potential COVID-19 infection risk. As criteria, the most prevalent virus transmission mechanisms were considered, namely the possibility of touching contaminated surfaces and the close proximity of workers. The higher risk occupations within the sector were identified, which facilitates the allocation of worker protection resources to the occupations where they are most needed. In particular, the results demonstrated that 50% of the agricultural workforce and 54% of the workers’ annual income are at moderate to high risk. As a consequence, a series of control measures need to be adopted so as to enhance the resilience and sustainability of the sector as well as protect farmers including physical distancing, hygiene practices, and personal protection equipment.","Bochtis, Dionysis Benos Lefteris Lampridi Maria Marinoudi Vasso Pearson Simon Sørensen Claus G.",Sustainability,596,1

One of these has been the need for public health authorities to engage in contact-tracing to help curb the spread of the disease. Manual contact-tracing for public health purposes is a well-established component of the management of epidemics and pandemics. Public health authorities identify infected individuals, question them about close contacts, and then reach out to those contacts with the appropriate public health advice. From the outset of the pandemic, many believed that technology could play a role in supplementing manual contact-tracing.

The presence and extent of coronary artery calcification (CAC) is a strong predictor of cardiovascular events, and CAC scoring has been shown to be more predictive of cardiovascular events than other traditional risk assessment scores2. Incidental coronary calcification can be detected and quantified on non-gated CT chest scans covering the heart in the field of view3. This finding is typically not reported4 and hence an opportunity to optimise cardiovascular risk assessment and treatment is missed. The Society of Thoracic Radiology have previously highlighted that incidental coronary calcification should be reported on CT chest scans5. We sought to investigate patients presenting to our centre with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) event with historical CT imaging demonstrating coronary artery calcification. Methods We retrospectively reviewed case records for all patients referred to our centre for an invasive coronary angiogram following their first known admission with an ACS event. ACS were defined according to contemporary guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology. We reviewed a 3 month period prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (01/01/2019 - 31/03/2019). The national imaging database in Scotland (PACS) was interrogated to identify previous CT imaging that includes the heart in the field of view. The presence of coronary calcification was confirmed and quantified using an ordinal scoring method previously described3. The clinical radiology reports for the scans were reviewed to determine the frequency of CAC being reported. Demographic information was collected from our electronic patient record (Clinical Portal) including the presence of risk factors for IHD. Prescribed medication prior to admission was also recorded using the on-admission medicines reconciliation documented in the electronic patient record. Results 385 patients with first presentation of ACS were identified (figure 1). 75 (19%) had a prior non-gated CT chest imaging. The most common indication for CT was for investigation of possible malignancy. The mean interval from CT imaging to ACS admission was 36 months.CAC was present on 67 (89%) scans. The mean ordinal score was 4.04, corresponding to moderate CAC. The distribution of CAC by coronary artery revealed the majority of disease to involve the left anterior descending artery (table 1). Only 12/67 (18%) of clinical radiology reports mentioned coronary calcification (figure 2). Patients with CAC frequently had risk factors for IHD (table 2). Despite this only 42% were prescribed antiplatelet therapy, and only 45% prescribed a statin. Conclusions A significant proportion of ACS admissions have evidence of CAC on historical CT scans. This finding is often not reported and the majority of patients with demonstrated coronary artery disease are not prescribed appropriate preventative therapies. Systematic reporting of this finding may have a significant impact on the prevention of acute cardiovascular events.","Bradley, C.; Aggarwal, A.; Goatman, K.; Jones, G.; Berry, C.; Good, R.",Heart,596,26

The 79-1683 feline coronavirus isolate caused an inapparent-to-mild enteritis when given oronasally to specific-pathogen-free kittens and was not a cause of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). Target tissues for the virus were the mature apical epithelium of the small intestine, mesenteric lymph nodes, tonsils, thymus, and (to a lesser extent) the lungs. Inoculated kittens shed high numbers of virus in their feces for 14 to 17 days, but remained infectious to susceptible kittens for longer periods of time, as evidenced by contact-exposure studies. Because the 79-1683 isolate induced only enteritis, it was designated feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) 79-1683. The 79-1146 feline coronavirus isolate induced effusive abdominal FIP in specific-pathogen-free kittens after oronasal and intraperitoneal inoculation. Clinical signs of disease appeared within 12 to 14 days in almost all inoculated kittens. Because this isolate caused FIP, it was designated FIP virus (FIPV) 79-1146. Cross-protective immunity was not induced by the various coronavirus infections. Kittens preimmunized with the UCD strain of FECV (FECV-UCD) or with FECV-79-1683 were not immune to infection with FIPV-79-1146. Likewise, kittens previously inoculated with FECV-79-1683 were not immune to infection with FIPV-UCD1.

Interventions for chronic venous ulcers have evolved to painless, minimally invasive, office-based procedures performed under local anesthesia. Recent advances in the endovascular management of lower-extremity superficial venous insufficiency have the potential to significantly enhance initial and long-term management of these patients, as minimally invasive procedures provide faster recoveries and fewer procedural risks. Early intervention for venous insufficiency has been shown to significantly decrease long-term ulcer recurrence rates, and may increase healing of venous ulcers as well. PURPOSE The purpose of this review and algorithm is to enhance understanding of venous ulceration and its underlying causes. Venous anatomy and pathophysiology will be reviewed. The etiology of chronic venous ulceration will be examined. Current practice guidelines and clinical outcomes will be reviewed. The newest treatment options, including minimally invasive therapy will be described. The current literature will be reviewed. A new algorithm for treatment that integrates the endovascular treatment of venous insufficiency into the current standard care for venous leg ulceration will be proposed. METHOD A literature review was performed to review all current treatments for venous ulceration. Treatments that have Level I evidence (with a grade of recommendation of A or B) to support their use for venous leg ulceration were selected for incorporation into a new treatment algorithm. The level-of-evidence and strength-of-recommendation scheme used in the algorithm is based upon the system used by the Wound Healing Society in its chronic wounds clinical practice guidelines. CONCLUSION It is intended that this new algorithm and approach to treatment will improve the immediate care of venous leg ulcer patients, reduce recurrence rates, increase patient satisfaction, and potentially expedite initial wound healing in the outpatient wound clinic setting.","Kistner, Robert L; Shafritz, Randy; Stark, Karl R; Warriner, Robert A",Ostomy/wound management,596,28

METHODS Primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) cultures established from HIV-1-infected patients were treated with KP in comparison with zidovudine and supernatants and cells were harvested for analysis of HIV RNA and proviral contents, respectively. Virus production in exogenous in-vitro PBMCs infection with lymphocytotropic and monocytotropic HIV-1 strains was also assessed in presence of KP by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay HIV p24 gag antigen detection. The binding affinity of KP to CD4, CCR5 and CXCR4 was evaluated on CD4-CCR5 or CD4-CXCR4 transfected astroglioma cell lines. RESULTS KP was shown to be devoid of cytotoxicity on PBMCs and to inhibit HIV-1 replication in PBMCs of a patient in the acute phase of infection. The antiretroviral activity of KP, which proved to be more potent than zidovudine at micromolar concentrations, is abolished by beta 1,3-glucan but not by beta 1,6-glucan. Down-regulation of CCR5 co-receptor, and/or physical block of the gp120-receptor interaction are possible mechanisms of KP activity. CONCLUSION KP appears to be the first antibody-derived short peptide displaying an inhibitory activity against HIV-1 and related opportunistic micro-organisms by different mechanisms of action.","Casoli, Claudio; Pilotti, Elisabetta; Perno, Carlo Federico; Balestra, Emanuela; Polverini, Eugenia; Cassone, Antonio; Conti, Stefania; Magliani, Walter; Polonelli, Luciano",AIDS,596,2

In this study, we investigated the function and the underlying mechanism of Gelsolin (GSN) 3'UTR in NSCLC H1299 and A549 cells. We found that transfected Flag-GSN plasmids significantly increased the proliferation, migration and invasion of NSCLC cells, whereas GSN 3'UTR could suppress the promotional effect of GSN protein on the development of NSCLC in vitro. Interestingly, we observed that these in vitro anticancer effects of GSN 3'UTR was independent of the co-expression with GSN coding sequence. Moreover, transfected GSN 3'UTR affected the actin-cytoskeleton remodeling and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) processes in H1299 and A549 cells, and targeted the co-expressed proteins to the plasma membrane. Subsequently, RNA pull-down assays have been performed to identify Tra2β protein as a GSN 3'UTR binder. We then showed that Tra2β was important for the localized protein expression mediated by GSN 3'UTR. Taken together, our results suggested that GSN 3'UTR may exert anticancer functions in NSCLC cells through regulating the subcellular localized expression of GSN protein mediated by the interaction between GSN 3'UTR-Tra2β.","Liu, Xiaohui; Huang, Xiuzhu; Ma, Jie; Li, Lu; Hu, Huifan; Feng, Junxia; Gao, Xuejuan; Zhang, Yunfang; Liu, Langxia",American journal of cancer research,596,11

Medicine, a profession of traditional principles and virtues, has faced unprecedented challenges in the light of scarce and unequal distribution of ventilators, testing, and personal protective equipment. Healthcare workers have been- and are increasingly likely to be- forced into situations that require difficult decision making under life-and-death conditions. Concepts of ""medical necessity"" and ""maximum benefit"" challenge healthcare systems that already struggle to manage unequal treatment and access to services, giving rise to moral distress and moral injury on the front lines. METHOD: This article focuses on moral injury in the context of coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 pandemic. I review recent literature to highlight the psychological impact of many morally-injurious events that have been reported during the COVID-19 pandemic. With the help of a clinical vignette, I point out how healthcare systems adopt many utilitarian policies in times of excessive healthcare burden and offer a viewpoint that many morally injurious events happen when physicians, traditionally practicing Kantian and virtue ethics, are forced to follow utilitarian policies of healthcare system. CONCLUSION: One form of moral injury may arise from inherent conflicts between individual deontological moral judgments and organizational utilitarian moral judgments. More research is needed to validate the philosophical viewpoint as well as to explore whether increased awareness and education of key principles within moral philosophy can better equip healthcare workers in situations when public health takes precedence over individual health.","Akram, Faisal",Ethics Med Public Health,596,16

Most interventions focus on an individual, but dietary and physical activity behaviors occur with, or are influenced by, domestic partners. According to interdependence theory, couples who approach behavior change as a problem to be tackled together versus independently are more likely to utilize communal coping processes to promote behavior change. We utilized interdependence theory to develop a partner-assisted intervention to increase long-term weight loss. METHODS: Community-dwelling individuals (index participants) cohabitating with a partner with 1) overweight and at least one obesity-related comorbidity or 2) obesity are randomized to participate in a standard weight management program alone or with their partner. The weight management program involves biweekly, in-person, group sessions focusing on weight loss for six months, followed by three group sessions and nine telephone calls focusing on weight loss maintenance for twelve months. In the partner-assisted arm, partners participate in half of the group sessions and telephone calls. Couples receive training in principles of cognitive behavioral therapy for couples, including sharing thoughts and feelings and joint problem solving, to increase communal coping. The primary outcome is participant weight loss at 24 months, with caloric intake and moderate-intensity physical activity as secondary outcomes. Partner weight and caloric intake will also be analyzed. Mediation analyses will examine the role of interdependence variables and social support. DISCUSSION: This trial will provide knowledge about effective ways to promote long-term weight loss and the role of interdependence constructs in weight loss.

This study provides a rapid analysis of the initial impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the management of UK leisure and competition horses. A 17 question online survey was distributed via equestrian social media sites to ascertain the impact of COVID-19 on horse and yard management and on human-horse interactions. Frequency analysis combined with Chi-squared and thematic analyses identified the impact of COVID-19 on UK horse owners. Major changes within horse management and horse-human interactions were reported for the majority of horse owners (>65%), regardless of the establishment type or region. Social distancing and visiting restrictions were implemented at most yards, but nearly half were not providing hand sanitization or disinfection protocols for the shared areas/equipment to prevent cross-contamination between users. The financial impact of the pandemic combined with restricted access to veterinary professionals resulted in owners expressing concerns that horse health and welfare may be compromised as a result.

To implement rapid and effective clinical management, early diagnosis is the mainstay. Today, real-time reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR test is the major diagnostic practice as a gold standard method for accurate diagnosis of this disease. On the other side, serological assays are easy to be implemented for the disease screening. Considering the limitations of today's tests including lengthy assay time, cost, the need for skilled personnel, and specialized infrastructure, both strategies, however, have impediments to be applied to the resource-scarce settings. Therefore, there is an urgent need to democratize all these practices to be applicable across the globe, specifically to the locations comprising of very limited infrastructure. In this regard, sensor systems have been utilized in clinical diagnostics largely, holding great potential to have pivotal roles as an alternative or complementary options to these current tests, providing crucial fashions such as being suitable for point-of-care settings, cost-effective, and having short turnover time. In particular, the integration of smart materials into sensor technologies leverages their analytical performances, including sensitivity, linear dynamic range, and specificity.

Fast, inclusive and adaptive methods are required for the heterogenous SARS-CoV-2 sequence data generated at an unprecedented rate. RESULTS: We present an updated version of the SARS-CoV-2 analysis module of our automated computational pipeline, Infectious Pathogen Detector (IPD) 2.0, to perform genomic analysis to understand the variability and dynamics of the virus. It adopts the recent clade nomenclature and demonstrates the clade prediction accuracy of 92.8%. IPD 2.0 also contains a SARS-CoV-2 updater module, allowing automatic upgrading of the variant database using genome sequences from GISAID. As a proof of principle, analyzing 208,911 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, we generate an extensive database of 2.58 million sample-wise variants. A comparative account of lineage-specific mutations in the newer SARS-CoV-2 strains emerging in the UK, South Africa and Brazil and data reported from India identify overlapping and lineages specific acquired mutations suggesting a repetitive convergent and adaptive evolution. CONCLUSIONS: A novel and dynamic feature of the SARS-CoV-2 module of IPD 2.0 makes it a contemporary tool to analyze the diverse and growing genomic strains of the virus and serve as a vital tool to help facilitate rapid genomic surveillance in a population to identify variants involved in breakthrough infections.

Our study aimed to focus on the mental health impact of the 2019-nCOVID pandemic on healthcare workers (HCWs) from North-Eastern Piedmont, Italy. For this purpose, we performed an online survey which was e-mailed to HCWs at the end of the first peak of the pandemic. We involved both frontline and not-frontline HCWs, employed in the hospital or in healthcare services outside the hospital. The primary outcome of our research was the assessment of burnout, while secondary outcomes included the investigation of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress symptoms. We observed higher levels of burnout (especially in the Depersonalization and Personal Accomplishment dimensions), in females, in HCWs aged <30 years, in those exposed to changes in their daily and family habits, in those who had to change their duties at work and in residents in training. In our HCWs sample we found lower levels of anxiety and depression than those reported in the literature. The problematic levels of burnout and adverse psychological outcomes observed during the pandemic cannot be underestimated. Given the recurrence in autumn 2020 of a new pandemic peak, which has once again put a strain on the health system and HCWs, it is supported the importance of a careful assessment of HCWs' mental health, and of the possible risk and protective factors both in the work environment and in the extra-work one.","Gramaglia, Carla; Marangon, Debora; Azzolina, Danila; Guerriero, Chiara; Lorenzini, Luca; Probo, Manuela; Rudoni, Marco; Gambaro, Eleonora; Zeppegno, Patrizia",Front Public Health,596,16

However, little is known about the impact of the pandemic on the prevalence of alcohol use disorder (AUD), especially in high-risk samples such as U.S. military veterans. METHODS: Data were analyzed from the 2019-2020 National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study, which surveyed a nationally representative, prospective cohort of 3078 U.S. veterans. Pre-pandemic and 1-year peri-pandemic risk and protective factors associated with incident and chronic probable AUD were examined. RESULTS: A total of 6.9 % (n = 183) of veterans were classified as chronic probable AUD, 3.2 % (n = 85) as remitted from AUD, and 2.7 % (n = 71) as incident probable AUD during the pandemic; the prevalence of probable AUD in the full sample remained stable -10.1 % pre-pandemic and 9.6 % peri-pandemic. Younger age, greater pre-pandemic alcohol use severity, and COVID-related stressors were associated with incident AUD during the pandemic, whereas higher pre-pandemic household income was associated with lower risk of this outcome. Younger age, combat experience, lifetime substance use disorder, greater drug use severity, lower dispositional optimism, and more COVID-related worries and social restriction stress were associated with higher risk of chronic AUD. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly 1-in-10 US veterans screened positive for AUD 1-year into the pandemic; however, the pre- and 1-year peri-pandemic prevalence of probable AUD remained stable. Veterans who are younger, have served in combat roles, endorse more COVID-related stressors, and have fewer socioeconomic resources may be at higher risk for AUD during the pandemic.","Na, Peter J; Norman, Sonya B; Nichter, Brandon; Hill, Melanie L; Rosen, Marc I; Petrakis, Ismene L; Pietrzak, Robert H",Drug Alcohol Depend,596,24

We aimed to investigate how frequently this cross-border travel occurs and the factors associated with it. A total of 278 Rb centres in 153 countries were recruited to participate in a global cross-sectional analysis of newly diagnosed Rb patients in 2017. Number and proportions of children who travelled from their home country for treatment were analysed by country, continent, socioeconomic stratum and clinical and demographic features. The cohort included 4351 new patients of whom 223 [5.1%, 95% confidence interval 4.5-5.8] were taken across country borders for planned medical treatment. Independently significant predictors of travelling across borders included: being from a country with a smaller population, being from a country classified as low socioeconomic status, having bilateral Rb and having intraocular disease without extraocular spread. The factors that determine international travel for Rb treatment are complex and deserve further investigation.

Nonstructural protein 14 (NSP14), which features exonuclease (ExoN) and guanine N7 methyltransferase activity, is a critical player in SARS-CoV-2 replication and fidelity and represents an attractive antiviral target. Initiating drug discovery efforts for nucleases such as NSP14 remains a challenge due to a lack of suitable high-throughput assay methodologies. This report describes the combination of self-assembled monolayers and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry to enable the first label-free and high-throughput assay for NSP14 ExoN activity. The assay was used to measure NSP14 activity and gain insight into substrate specificity and the reaction mechanism. Next, the assay was optimized for kinetically balanced conditions and miniaturized, while achieving a robust assay (Z factor > 0.8) and a significant assay window (signal-to-background ratio > 200). Screening 10,240 small molecules from a diverse library revealed candidate inhibitors, which were counterscreened for NSP14 selectivity and RNA intercalation. The assay methodology described here will enable, for the first time, a label-free and high-throughput assay for NSP14 ExoN activity to accelerate drug discovery efforts and, due to the assay flexibility, can be more broadly applicable for measuring other enzyme activities from other viruses or implicated in various pathologies.","Scholle, Michael D; Liu, Cheng; Deval, Jerome; Gurard-Levin, Zachary A",SLAS Discov,596,0

However, the outcomes for patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure cared for with Anesthesia Machines is currently unknow. We hypothesized that COVID-19 patients receiving care with Anesthesia Machines would have worse outcomes compared to standard practice. METHODS: We designed a retrospective study of patients admitted with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis at a large tertiary urban hospital in northern Italy. Two care units were included: a 27-bed standard ICU and a 15-bed temporary unit emergently opened in an operating room setting. Intubated patients assigned to Anesthesia Machines (AM group) were compared to a control cohort treated with standard mechanical ventilators (ICU-VENT group). Outcomes were assessed at 60-day follow-up. A multivariable Cox regression analysis of risk factors between survivors and non-survivors was conducted to determine the adjusted risk of death for patients assigned to AM group. RESULTS: Complete daily data from 89 mechanically ventilated patients consecutively admitted to the two units were analyzed. Seventeen patients were included in the AM group, whereas 72 were in the ICU-VENT group. Disease severity and intensity of treatment were comparable between the two groups. The 60-day mortality was significantly higher in the AM group compared to the ICU-vent group (12/17 vs. 27/72, 70.6% vs. 37.5%, respectively, p = 0.016). Allocation to AM group was associated with a significantly increased risk of death after adjusting for covariates (HR 4.05, 95% CI: 1.75-9.33, p = 0.001). Several incidents and complications were reported with Anesthesia Machine care, raising safety concerns. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the hypothesis that care associated with the use of Anesthesia Machines is inadequate to provide long-term critical care to patients with COVID-19. Added safety risks must be considered if no other option is available to treat severely ill patients during the ongoing pandemic.

It is a prominently respiratory infection, with potential cardiological, hematological, gastrointestinal and renal complications. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is found in 0.5-25% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and constitutes a negative prognostic factor. Renal damage mechanisms are not completely clear. We report the clinical evolution of hospitalized COVID-19 patients who presented with AKI requiring attention from the Nephrology team in a tertiary hospital in Madrid, Spain. METHODS: This is an observational prospective study including all COVID-19 cases that required hospitalization and Nephrology management from March 6th to May 12th 2020. We collected clinical and analytical data of baseline characteristics, COVID-19 and AKI evolutions. RESULTS: We analyzed 41 patients with a mean age of 66.8 years (SD 2.1), 90.2% males, and with a history of chronic kidney disease in 36.6%. A percentage of 56.1 presented with severe pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome, and 31.7% required intensive care. AKI etiology was prerenal in 61%, acute tubular necrosis in the context of sepsis in 24.4%, glomerular in 7.3% and tubular toxicity in 7.3% of the cases. We reported proteinuria in 88.9% and hematuria in 79.4% of patients. A percentage of 48.8 required renal replacement therapy. Median length of stay was 12 days (IQR 9-23) and 22% of the population died. Patients who developed AKI during hospital stay presented with higher C-reactive protein, LDH and D-dimer values, more severe pulmonary damage, more frequent ICU admission, treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir and biological drugs and renal replacement therapy requirement. CONCLUSIONS: Hypovolemia and dehydration are a frequent cause of AKI among COVID-19 patients. Those who develop AKI during hospitalization display worse prognostic factors in terms of pulmonary damage, renal damage, and analytical findings. We believe that monitorization of renal markers, as well as individualized fluid management, can play a key role in AKI prevention.","Tarragón, Blanca; Valdenebro, María; Serrano, Maria Luisa; Maroto, Alba; Llópez-Carratalá, M Rosario; Ramos, Antonio; Rubio, Esther; Huerta, Ana; Marques, María; Portolés, Jose",Nefrologia,596,6

The IHR and the World Health Organization (WHO) have a strong preference for borders to remain open. Yet, we argue here, non-compliance by WHO member states is not the only problem with the IHR's treatment of borders. Bringing insights from critical border studies and exploring the varied ways in which the response to the COVID-19 crisis has been “bordered,” we argue that a much broader understanding of “borders” is required in the IHR and by the WHO, given that much of the exclusionary bordering we find takes place away from physical points of entry.","Ferhani, Adam; Rushton, Simon",Contemp.

It also compared the diagnostic performances of upper respiratory tract (URT) and lower respiratory tract (LRT) samples for SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: From 25 January to 29 March 2020, all URT and LRT samples collected from patients with suspected COVID-19 received in the virology laboratory of Pitié-Salpêtrière University Hospital (Paris, France) were simultaneously tested for SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses. RESULTS: A total of 1423 consecutive patients were tested: 677 (47.6%) males, 746 (52.4%) females, median age 50 (range, 1-103) years. Twenty-one (1.5%) patients were positive for both SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses. The detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 was significantly higher in LRT than in URT (53.6% vs. 13.4%; p<0.0001). The analysis of paired samples from 117 (8.2%) patients showed that SARS-CoV-2 load was lower in URT than in LRT samples in 65% of cases. CONCLUSION: The detection of other respiratory viruses in patients during this epidemic period could not rule out SARS-CoV-2 co-infection.

Using imaginization, this research examines practices of ethical leadership during a crisis, using The Walking Dead television series as a reference. The Walking Dead offers an artistic representation of different leadership styles, with business organizations likened to groups of survivors. Its post-apocalyptic setting offers something of an analogy to the COVID-19 crisis. Each firm’s struggle for survival in the face of external threats is paralleled with each community’s struggle to protect members’ lives, preserve resources, and pursue development. The practices of the leaders in the program are compared to those of the leaders of firms such as P&G, Boeing, GM, Renault-Nissan, IBM, BP, GE, Berkshire Hathaway, Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Ali Baba, Netflix, Airbnb, Uber, and SpaceX. This paper illustrates why ethical leadership goes far beyond charisma and competencies to involve deep motivations and sincere emotions and why it is accessible to everyone through a process of learning and transformation. The study shows the need to adapt leadership style to context. Good leaders know when to step back, meditate, and be lucid. They balance consultation and initiative. They do not fear other leaders and mentor new ones.","Allal-Chérif, Oihab Guijarro-García María Carlos Ballester-Miquel José Carrilero-Castillo Agustín",Journal of Business Research,596,24

We have developed an analytical model capable of reproducing the coherent transient signals obtained with a millimeter-wave chirped pulse setup operated in a monochromatic pulse mode. The fit of the model against the experimental data allowed access to the amplitude of the electric field and, as a byproduct, to the molecular relaxation times T 1 and T 2.","Dhont, G; Fontanari, D; Bray, C; Mouret, G; Cuisset, A; Hindle, F; Hickson, K M; Bocquet, R",J Infrared Millim Terahertz Waves,596,24

The purpose of this study was to determine the precision and accuracy of intraoperative LLD and CO measurement with express workflow robotic THA. METHODS: Between February 2018 and December 2019, 30 patients underwent an express workflow robot-assisted primary THA for intraoperative LLD and CO measurements. Postoperative radiographs were used for LLD and CO measurement. In order to examine the accuracy of the robotic system assessment, the absolute difference between the robotic assessments and radiographic evaluations was calculated. RESULTS: Intraoperative robotic measurements reported a mean error of 0.2-0.6 mm for each registration, with no significant difference between them (p = 0.311). The average absolute discrepancies between the robotic and radiographic assessments in the LLD and CO measurements were 1.3 ± 1.5 mm (p = 0.17) and 1.1 ± 0.9 mm (p = 0.11), respectively, while the Pearson's correlation coefficients were 0.69 and 0.71. CONCLUSIONS: An external marker without a femoral array inserted into a screw positioned in the greater trochanter would be an easier and faster method to measure LLD and CO. Our study showed that the measured values of LLD and CO obtained by intraoperative express workflow robot-assisted THA system were precise and accurate. This article is protected by copyright.

Dromedary camels are a natural host of the virus and the source of zoonotic human infection. In experimental studies, Bactrian camels are susceptible to MERS-CoV infection similar to dromedary camels; however, neither the virus, viral RNA, nor virus-specific antibodies were detected in Bactrian camel field samples so far. The aim of our study was to survey Mongolian camels for MERS-CoV-specific antibodies. A total of 180 camel sera, collected in 2016 and 2017, were involved in this survey: 17 of 180 sera were seropositive with an initial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test performed at the State Central Veterinary Laboratory in Mongolia. These 17 positive sera plus 53 additional negative sera were sent to the Rocky Mountain Laboratories, NIAID/NIH, and tested for the presence of antibodies with a similar ELISA, an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and a virus neutralization test (VNT). In these additional tests, a total of 21 of 70 sera were positive with ELISA and 10 sera were positive with IFA; however, none was positive in the VNT. Based on these results, we hypothesize that the ELISA/IFA-positive antibodies are (1) non-neutralizing antibodies or (2) directed against a MERS-CoV-like virus circulating in Bactrian camels in Mongolia.","Bold, Dashzeveg; van Doremalen, Neeltje; Myagmarsuren, Odonchimeg; Zayat, Batsukh; Munster, Vincent J; Richt, Juergen A",,596,20

We used latent transition analysis to determine the stability of subgroup membership pre- and post-COVID and the effect of attachment to pets on transition probabilities. Mental health before COVID-19 was measured retrospectively. Five subgroups were identified: low symptoms, mild symptoms, moderate symptoms, high symptoms, and severe symptoms. Among individuals in the moderate and high symptoms subgroups, those who reported high attachment to pets generally had greater odds of transitioning to a less severe symptom profile (OR = 2.12) over time than those with low attachment to pets (OR = 1.39). However, those who had a severe symptom profile and high attachment to pets had lower odds of transitioning to a less severe symptom profile (OR = 0.30) and higher odds of maintaining a severe symptom profile (OR = 3.33) than those with low attachment to pets. These findings suggest that the protective and risk effects of attachment to pets differ based on individuals' psychological symptom patterns across multiple indicators.

METHODS: We performed secondary data analysis using tract (N = 73,056) and county (N = 3142) level data from the US Census Bureau and other sources for the USA. Confirmed COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 population was our outcome measure. We performed mixed-effect negative binomial regression to examine the association of county population's percentage residing in concentrated disadvantage and Black-concentrated tracts with COVID-19 deaths while controlling for several other characteristics. RESULTS: For every 10% increase in the percentage of county population residing in concentrated disadvantage and Black-concentrated tracts, the rate for confirmed COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 population increases by a factor of 1.14 (mortality rate ratio [MMR] = 1.14; 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.11, 1.18) and 1.11 (MMR = 1.11; 95% CI:1.08, 1.14), respectively. These relations stayed significant in all models in further sensitivity analyses. Moreover, a joint increase in the percentage of county population residing in racial and socioeconomic segregation was associated with a much greater increase in COVID-19 deaths. CONCLUSIONS: It appears that people living in socioeconomically and racially segregated neighborhoods may be disproportionately impacted by COVID-19 deaths. Future multilevel and longitudinal studies with data at both individual and aggregated tract level can help isolate the potential impacts of the individual-level characteristics and neighborhood-level socioeconomic and racial segregation with more precision and confidence.","Khanijahani, Ahmad; Tomassoni, Larisa",J. racial ethnic health disparities (Internet),596,11

Digital technologies may offer an innovative way to support the mental health needs of women and their families throughout the perinatal period, as well as assist midwives in the recognition of perinatal mental health concerns. However, little is known about the acceptability and perceived benefits and barriers to using such technologies. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a mixed methods evaluation of the current state of perinatal mental healthcare provision in the UK, as well as users' (women and partners) and midwives' interest in using a digital mental health assessment throughout the perinatal period. METHODS: Eight hundred and twenty-nine women, 103 partners, and 90 midwives participated in the study, which entailed completing an online survey. Quantitative data were explored using descriptive statistics. Open-ended response data were first investigated using thematic analysis. Resultant themes were then mapped onto the components of the Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation Model of Behavior (COM-B model) and summarized using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: The provision of adequate perinatal mental healthcare support was limited, with experiences varying significantly across respondents. There was a strong interest in using a digital mental health assessment to screen, diagnose, and triage perinatal mental health concerns, particularly among women and midwives. The digital assessment was seen to be well placed within maternity healthcare settings, with in-person only and blended care (i.e., in-person and remote support) approaches being preferred by women and partners in the event of further care being advised. Identified benefits and barriers mainly related to physical opportunity (e.g., accessibility), psychological capability (e.g., cognitive skills) and automatic motivation (e.g., emotions). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides proof-of-concept support for the development and implementation of a digital mental health assessment to inform clinical decision-making in the assessment of perinatal mental health concerns in the UK.","Martin-Key, Nayra Anna; Spadaro, Benedetta; Schei, Thea Sofie; Bahn, Sabine",J. med. internet res,596,1

Investigating these effects is particularly important in health disparities research when we seek to quantify inequities in timely delivery of treatment and its impact on patients survival time. Current approaches fail to account for semi-competing risks arising in this setting. Under the potential outcome framework, we define and provide identifiability conditions for causal estimands for stochastic direct and indirect effects. Causal contrasts are estimated in continuous time within a multistate modeling framework and analytic formulae for the estimators of the causal contrasts are developed. We show via simulations that ignoring censoring in mediator and or outcome time-to-event processes, or ignoring competing risks may give misleading results. This work demonstrates that rigorous definition of the direct and indirect effects and joint estimation of the outcome and mediator time-to-event distributions in the presence of semi-competing risks are crucial for valid investigation of mechanisms in continuous time. We employ this novel methodology to investigate the role of delaying treatment uptake in explaining racial disparities in cancer survival in a cohort study of colon cancer patients.","Valeri, Linda; Proust-Lima, C'ecile; Fan, Weijia; Chen, Jarvis T.; Jacqmin-Gadda, H'elene",,596,16

Minichromosome maintenance eight homologous recombination repair factor (MCM8), a newly discovered MCM family member, has been shown to be required for DNA replication. Unfortunately, little is known concerning the roles of MCM8 in bladder cancer. METHODS: The present study, we aimed at probing into the impacts and detailed mechanisms of MCM8 in bladder cancer progression. In this study, MCM8 expression level was detected through immunohistochemistry staining (IHC), qRT-PCR and Western blot assay. Silenced MCM8 cell models were constructed by lentivirus transfection. In vitro, the cell proliferation was evaluated by the MTT assay. The wound-healing assay and the transwell assay were utilized to assess the cell migration. Also, the cell apoptosis and the cell cycle were determined by flow cytometry. Moreover, the Human Apoptosis Antibody Array assay was performed to analyze the alterations of apoptosis-related proteins. The in vivo experiments were conducted to verify the effects of MCM8 knockdown on the tumor growth of bladder cancer. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that compared with normal adjacent tissues, MCM8 expression in bladder cancer tissues was strongly up-regulated. The up-regulation of MCM8 expression in bladder cancer may be a valuable independent prognostic indicator. Of note, MCM8 inhibition modulated the malignant phenotypes of bladder cancer cells. In terms of mechanism, it was validated that MCM8 knockdown made Akt, P-Akt, CCND1 and CDK6 levels down-regulated, as well as MAPK9 up-regulated. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our study demonstrated an important role of MCM8 in bladder cancer and created a rationale for the therapeutic potential of MCM8 inhibition in human bladder cancer therapy.","Zhu, Wei; Gao, Fei; Zhou, Hongyi; Jin, Ke; Shao, Jianfeng; Xu, Zhuoqun",Cancer Cell Int,596,10

The model adopted is similar to SEIQR, with the infected patients split into groups of asymptomatic subjects and isolated ones. This distinction is particularly important in the current pandemic, due to the fundamental the role of asymptomatic subjects in the virus diffusion. The influence of the control actions is considered in analysing the model, from the calculus of the equilibrium points to the determination of the reproduction number. This choice is motivated by the fact that the available organised data have been collected since from the end of February 2020, and almost simultaneously containment measures, increasing in typology and effectiveness, have been applied. The characteristics of COVID-19, not fully understood yet, suggest an asymmetric diffusion among countries and among categories of subjects. Referring to the Italian situation, the containment measures, as applied by the population, have been identified, showing their relation with the government’s decisions;this allows the study of possible scenarios, comparing the impact of different possible choices.","Di Giamberardino, Paolo Caldarella Rita Iacoviello Daniela",Symmetry,596,27

The global health threat posed by this pandemic led to an extremely rapid and robust mobilization of the scientific and medical communities as evidenced by the publication of more than 10,000 peer-reviewed articles and thousands of preprints in the first year of the pandemic alone. With the publication of the initial genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2, the proteomics community immediately joined this effort publishing, to date, more than 100 peer-reviewed proteomics studies and submitting many more preprints to preprint servers. In this review, we focus on peer-reviewed articles published on the proteome, glycoproteome, and glycome of SARS-CoV-2. At a basic level, proteomic studies provide valuable information on quantitative aspects of viral infection course; information on the identities, sites, and microheterogeneity of post-translational modifications; and, information on protein-protein interactions. At a biological systems level, these studies elucidate host cell and tissue responses, characterize antibodies and other immune system factors in infection, suggest biomarkers that may be useful for diagnosis and disease-course monitoring, and help in the development or repurposing of potential therapeutics. Here, we summarize results from selected early studies to provide a perspective on the current rapidly evolving literature.","Praissman, Jeremy L; Wells, Lance",Mol Cell Proteomics,596,22

We aimed to characterize sex differences in severe outcomes in adults with diabetes hospitalized for COVID-19. Methods: We performed a sex-stratified analysis of clinical and biological features and outcomes (i.e. invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), death, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and home discharge at day 7 (D7) or day 28 (D28)) in 2380 patients with diabetes hospitalized for COVID-19 and included in the nationwide CORONADO observational study (NCT04324736). Results: The study population was predominantly male (63.5%). After multiple adjustments, female sex was negatively associated with the primary outcome (IMV and/or death, OR: 0.66 (0.49-0.88)), death (OR: 0.49 (0.30-0.79)) and ICU admission (OR: 0.57 (0.43-0.77)) at D7 but only with ICU admission (OR: 0.58 (0.43-0.77)) at D28. Older age and a history of microvascular complications were predictors of death at D28 in both sexes, while chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was predictive of death in women only. At admission, C-reactive protein (CRP), aspartate amino transferase (AST) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), according to the CKD-EPI formula predicted death in both sexes. Lymphocytopenia was an independent predictor of death in women only, while thrombocytopenia and elevated plasma glucose concentration were predictors of death in men only. Conclusions: In patients with diabetes admitted for COVID-19, female sex was associated with lower incidence of early severe outcomes, but did not influence the overall in-hospital mortality, suggesting that diabetes mitigates the female protection from COVID-19 severity. Sex-associated biological determinants may be useful to optimize COVID-19 prevention and management in women and men.","Tramunt, Blandine; Smati, Sarra; Coudol, Sandrine; Wargny, Matthieu; Pichelin, Matthieu; Guyomarch, Béatrice; Al-Salameh, Abdallah; Amadou, Coralie; Barraud, Sara; Bigot, Edith; Bordier, Lyse; Borot, Sophie; Bourgeon, Muriel; Bourron, Olivier; Charrière, Sybil; Chevalier, Nicolas; Cosson, Emmanuel; Fève, Bruno; Flaus-Furmaniuk, Anna; Fontaine, Pierre; Galioot, Amandine; Gonfroy-Leymarie, Céline; Guerci, Bruno; Lablanche, Sandrine; Lalau, Jean-Daniel; Larger, Etienne; Lasbleiz, Adèle; Laviolle, Bruno; Marre, Michel; Munch, Marion; Potier, Louis; Prevost, Gaëtan; Renard, Eric; Reznik, Yves; Seret-Bégué, Dominique; Sibilia, Paul; Thuillier, Philippe; Vergès, Bruno; Gautier, Jean-François; Hadjadj, Samy; Cariou, Bertrand; Mauvais-Jarvis, Franck; Gourdy, Pierre",Eur J Endocrinol,596,20

Despite the promising theory, invariance principle-based approaches fail in common classification tasks, where invariant (causal) features capture all the information about the label. Are these failures due to the methods failing to capture the invariance? Or is the invariance principle itself insufficient? To answer these questions, we revisit the fundamental assumptions in linear regression tasks, where invariance-based approaches were shown to provably generalize OOD. In contrast to the linear regression tasks, we show that for linear classification tasks we need much stronger restrictions on the distribution shifts, or otherwise OOD generalization is impossible. Furthermore, even with appropriate restrictions on distribution shifts in place, we show that the invariance principle alone is insufficient. We prove that a form of the information bottleneck constraint along with invariance helps address key failures when invariant features capture all the information about the label and also retains the existing success when they do not. We propose an approach that incorporates both of these principles and demonstrate its effectiveness in several experiments.","Ahuja, Kartik; Caballero, Ethan; Zhang, Dinghuai; Bengio, Yoshua; Mitliagkas, Ioannis; Rish, Irina",,596,1

There has been an unprecedented rise in the use of personal protective equipment and practice of personal hygiene measures against COVID-19. The extended use of protective measures (PM) can lead to ill effects on the skin. Our aim was to investigate PM-induced dermatoses amongst healthcare workers and the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted over a period of 2 months. The study subjects were patients who presented to dermatology outpatient clinics or sought teleconsultation for skin problems related to the use of PMs against COVID-19. A detailed history was obtained and cutaneous examination was documented for all the patients in a pre-set proforma. Diagnoses of the adverse skin effects were formulated based upon history and clinical examination. RESULTS: A total of 101 cases with cutaneous adverse effects due to the use of PMs against COVID-19 were included in the study. The general population and healthcare workers were affected similarly, comprising of 54.5% and 45.5%, respectively. The mean age of the study participants was 36.71 ± 15.72 years.

The Adult Day Service (ADS) Plus intervention is delivered by trained staff at adult day service facilities to assist older adults with cognitive impairments and their family caregivers. Because sizable imbalances on important site characteristics might emerge from a simple randomization, we implemented a 3-stage constrained randomization approach to limit imbalance between intervention and usual care control conditions on 5 site characteristics: capacity; % of minority clients; % of clients with dementia; urban, rural or suburban location; and private or public ownership. In stage 1, the Balance Match Weighted (BMW) re-randomization procedure was used to assign 30 sites to ADS Plus or control arms based on the best randomization out of 20 total randomization for minimizing site imbalance. In stage 2, propensity scores from the BMW logistic regression analysis for reserve sites were used to determine substitutions for randomized sites that opted out of the CRT prior to implementation. In stage 3, a minimization approach was used to add 20 more sites to the trial. A standardized metric based on the half-normal distribution of the absolute value of mean differences was used to assess site imbalance.

METHODS: We conducted a health records review of adult patients diagnosed with a cardiac condition who were identified as low risk by the screening tool and transported by PCP(f). We excluded patients transported by an advanced care crew, those accompanied by a clinical escort from hospital, and those transported from a scene call, by rotary wing or ground vehicle. We recorded patient and transportation parameters using a piloted-standardized collection tool. We defined adverse events during transport a priori. We report descriptive statistics using mean (standard deviation), [range], (percentage). RESULTS: We included 400 patients: mean age 66.9 years old, 66.5% male. Mean transport duration was 136.2 (74.9) minutes. Most common comorbidities were hypertension (50.3%) and coronary artery disease (39.5%). Most transports originated out of Northern Ontario and were for cardiac catheterization (61.8%) or coronary artery bypass grafting (26.8%). Overall, the adverse event rate was low (0.3%), with no serious event such as cardiac arrest, death, or airway intervention. CONCLUSIONS: A screening tool can identify cardiac patients at low risk for clinical deterioration during air-medical transport. We believe patients screened with this tool can be transported safely by a PCP(f) crew, leading to potentially significant resource savings.","Godbout, Justin; Moore, Sean W; Sawadsky, Bruce; Pan, Andy; Vaillancourt, Christian",CJEM,596,16

Because of their epidemiological significance, vaccinations are considered compulsory in many countries and their evasion is penalized. Anti-vaccine movements may pose a threat to the epidemiological situation in many countries. The study presents the arguments formulated by opponents of vaccination and provides counter-arguments. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study is based on the analysis of data stored in scientific databases, information obtained from Google, Bing and Yahoo on the Internet, as well as newspapers, magazines and opinion-forming websites. RESULTS: The slogans propagated by anti-vaccination movements are usually based on easily proven erroneous theories and lies, although there are also arguments expressing belief in the conspiracy of governments, politicians and vaccine manufacturers, or incompetence of scientists and practitioners. CONCLUSIONS: In recent years in Poland, the activity of movements against vaccination has increased significantly, and their propaganda, through its negative impact on social attitudes, threatens to destabilize the epidemiological situation. Analysis of arguments used by the opponents of vaccination suggests a lack of reliable knowledge, religious overtones (addressed to people with fundamentalist personalities), or the ill-will attitudes of anti-vaccine individuals/groups used for their own purposes. Familiarization with the arguments of anti-vaccine propaganda is necessary in order to implement effective methods of fighting such attitudes and beliefs.","Kollataj, Witold Piotr; Kollataj, Barbara; Panasiuk, Lech; Sobieszczanski, Jaroslaw; Karwat, Irena Dorota",Ann Agric Environ Med,596,20

While the disease primarily presents as a respiratory illness, gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea have been reported in up to one-third of confirmed cases, and patients may have mild symptoms that do not prompt them to seek medical attention. Internet-based infodemiology offers an approach to studying symptoms at a population level, even in individuals who do not seek medical care. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine if a correlation exists between internet searches for gastrointestinal symptoms and the confirmed case count of COVID-19 in the United States. METHODS: The search terms chosen for analysis in this study included common gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Furthermore, the search terms fever and cough were used as positive controls, and constipation was used as a negative control. Daily query shares for the selected symptoms were obtained from Google Trends between October 1, 2019 and June 15, 2020 for all US states. These shares were divided into two time periods: pre-COVID-19 (prior to March 1) and post-COVID-19 (March 1-June 15). Confirmed COVID-19 case numbers were obtained from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering data repository. Moving averages of the daily query shares (normalized to baseline pre-COVID-19) were then analyzed against the confirmed disease case count and daily new cases to establish a temporal relationship. RESULTS: The relative search query shares of many symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and constipation, remained near or below baseline throughout the time period studied; however, there were notable increases in searches for the positive control symptoms of fever and cough as well as for diarrhea. These increases in daily search queries for fever, cough, and diarrhea preceded the rapid rise in number of cases by approximately 10 to 14 days. The search volumes for these terms began declining after mid-March despite the continued rises in cumulative cases and daily new case counts. CONCLUSIONS: Google searches for symptoms may precede the actual rises in cases and hospitalizations during pandemics. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, this study demonstrates that internet search queries for fever, cough, and diarrhea increased prior to the increased confirmed case count by available testing during the early weeks of the pandemic in the United States. While the search volumes eventually decreased significantly as the number of cases continued to rise, internet query search data may still be a useful tool at a population level to identify areas of active disease transmission at the cusp of new outbreaks.","Rajan, Anjana; Sharaf, Ravi; Brown, Robert S; Sharaiha, Reem Z; Lebwohl, Benjamin; Mahadev, SriHari",JMIR Public Health Surveill,596,16

METHODS: We report five cases of oropharyngeal hemorrhage in COVID-19 patients on mechanical ventilation requiring evaluation by otolaryngologists at George Washington University Hospital (GWUH) and Boston Medical Center (BMC) from March to April 2020. Institutional Review Board at both institutions exempted this study from informed consent because there were no identifiable patient characteristics, photographs, or imaging studies included. RESULTS: All five patients were managed conservatively; four required packing with Kerlix gauze by an otolaryngologist. Two patients had the additional requirement of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and associated anticoagulation. Three patients improved with oropharyngeal packing; two had persistent bleeding. Three patients expired. Endotracheal tubes were repositioned less frequently due to the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Intubated patients with COVID-19 may have an increased risk of oropharyngeal hemorrhage. This may be due to anticoagulation, prolonged intubation, or decreased frequency of endotracheal tube repositioning.

In the general population, the disease is more common among racial and ethnic minority populations, and severity is increased with comorbid conditions and obesity. The purpose of this study is to characterize COVID-19 infection in pregnancy in a population of women getting prenatal care at an urban safety-net hospital. Beginning in April, 2020, all women were tested at admission for delivery, and additionally as an outpatient if presenting with COVID-19 symptoms. In three months, there were 208 discrete women tested and 23 (11.1%) who were positive for COVID-19. The incidence of COVID-19 was 5.1% in asymptomatic women being screened upon admission to the hospital. There was a high prevalence of obesity (68.2%) and other comorbid conditions (43.5%) in this population, and all patients were racial/ethnic minorities. Despite these risk factors, the patients uniformly had either mild or asymptomatic disease. No symptomatic patients required hospitalization for their infection. In this population of pregnant women at high risk for severe COVID-19 infection, only mild disease was observed.","Dhuyvetter, Amanda; Cejtin, Helen E; Adam, Megan; Patel, Ashlesha",J. community health,596,24

During the COVID-19 public health emergency, many reports have described the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stools from COVID-19 patients, and a few studies reported the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewaters worldwide. Italy is among the world's worst-affected countries in the COVID-19 pandemic, but so far there are no studies assessing the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in Italian wastewaters. To this aim, twelve influent sewage samples, collected between February and April 2020 from Wastewater Treatment Plants in Milan and Rome, were tested adapting, for concentration, the standard WHO procedure for Poliovirus surveillance. Molecular analysis was undertaken with three nested protocols, including a newly designed SARS-CoV-2 specific primer set. SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was accomplished in volumes of 250 ml of wastewaters collected in areas of high (Milan) and low (Rome) epidemic circulation, according to clinical data. Overall, 6 out of 12 samples were positive. One of the positive results was obtained in a Milan wastewater sample collected a few days after the first notified Italian case of autochthonous SARS-CoV-2.

Since then, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread worldwide becoming a pandemic. Beyond the risks strictly related to the infection, concerns have been expressed for the psychological impact that COVID-19 may have, especially on vulnerable individuals with pre-existing mental health conditions. Somatic symptom disorder (SSD) is characterized by a dysfunctional preoccupation with physical symptoms leading to excessive and unnecessary healthcare utilization. Despite being quite common, such condition remains underrecognized. We report a detailed clinical case of a 16 years old adolescent, who presented with a history suggestive of COVID-19 infection and associated psychological distress. Despite testing negative for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, his extreme and persisting health preoccupations required an inpatient admission to the Child and Adolescent Neuropsychiatric Unit. He responded rapidly to a low dose of antipsychotic and an antidepressant. Based on his medical history and current presentation, he received a diagnosis of SSD. When COVID-19-like symptoms occur, we highlight the importance of differentially diagnosing a possible exacerbation of a pre-existing SSD, triggered by fear of being infected. This may help preventing further burden to the healthcare system.","Colizzi, Marco; Bortoletto, Riccardo; Silvestri, Marta; Mondini, Federica; Puttini, Elena; Cainelli, Chiara; Gaudino, Rossella; Ruggeri, Mirella; Zoccante, Leonardo",Brain Behav Immun Health,596,26

Methods We performed global micro-RNA (miRNA) analysis in plasma in two cohorts encompassing 375 individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes with late diabetic kidney disease and targeted proteomics analysis in plasma in four cohorts encompassing 746 individuals with late and early diabetic kidney disease. We examined structural lesions in kidney biopsies from the 105 individuals with early diabetic kidney disease. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were used to assess the effects of miRNA mimics or inhibitors on regulation of candidate proteins. Results In the late diabetic kidney disease cohorts, we identified 17 circulating miRNAs represented by four exemplars (miR-1287-5p, miR-197-5p, miR-339-5p, miR-328-3p), which were strongly associated with 10-year risk of ESKD. These miRNAs targeted proteins in the axon guidance pathway. Circulating levels of six of these proteins-most notably EFNA4 and EPHA2-were strongly associated with 10-year risk of ESKD in all cohorts. Furthermore, circulating levels of these proteins correlated with severity of structural lesions in kidney biopsies. In contrast, expression levels of genes encoding these proteins had no apparent effects on the lesions. In in vitro experiments, mimics of miR-1287-5p and miR-197-5p and inhibitors of miR-339-5p and miR328-3p upregulated concentrations of EPHA2 in either cell lysate, supernatant, or both. Conclusions This study reveals novel mechanisms involved in progression to ESKD and points to the importance of systemic factors in the development of diabetic kidney disease. Some circulating miRNAs and axon guidance pathway proteins represent potential targets for new therapies to prevent and treat this condition.","Satake, Eiichiro; Saulnier, Pierre-Jean; Kobayashi, Hiroki; Gupta, Manoj; Looker, Helen; Wilson, Jonathan; Md Dom, Zaipul; Ihara, Katsuhito; O039,; Neil, Kristina; Krolewski, Bozena; Pipino, Caterina; Pavkov, Meda; Nair, Viji; Bitzer, Markus; Niewczas, Monika; Kretzler, Matthias; Mauer, Michael; Doria, Alessandro; Najafian, Behzad; Kulkarni, Rohit; Duffin, Kevin; Pezzolesi, Marcus; Kahn, C Ronald; Nelson, Robert; Krolewski, Andrzej",J.

OBJETIVO: Determinar las características perinatales, morbilidad, mortalidad y resultados serológicos en neonatos de gestantes seropositivas para SARS-CoV-2. MÉTODOS: Estudio transversal, descriptivo y retrospectivo. Participaron todos los neonatos cuyas madres presentaron resultado seropositivo para SARS-CoV-2 antes del parto, entre el 15 de abril y 10 de mayo de 2020 en el Instituto Nacional Materno Perinatal de Perú. Se recogió información materna y neonatal a partir de sus historias clínicas. En el análisis se usó estadística descriptiva y prueba exacta de Fisher. RESULTADOS: Se identificaron 114 neonatos, el 36,8% presentó inmunoglobulinas M y G positivas para SARS-CoV-2; el 7% inmunoglobulinas G y 56,2% fue no reactivo. Las complicaciones obstétricas más frecuentes fueron rotura prematura de membranas (14,9%) y parto pretérmino (8,8%). El 8,8% de los neonatos presentaron un puntaje Apgar al minuto menor o igual a seis, y de ellos solo uno persistió a los cinco minutos; tres neonatos fallecieron. Se evidenció asociación entre el tipo de inmunoglobulina materna y la serología de su recién nacido (p < 0,05).

Macrophage polarisation and their secreted inflammatory factors have an association with the outcome of inflammation. Luteolin, a flavonoid abundant in plants, has anti-inflammatory activity, but whether luteolin can manipulate M1/M2 polarisation of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) to suppress inflammation is still unclear. This study aimed to observe the effects of luteolin on the polarity of BMDMs derived from C57BL/6 mice and the expression of inflammatory factors, to explore the mechanism by which luteolin regulates the BMDM polarity. Methods M1-polarised BMDMs were induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) + interferon (IFN)-γ and M2-polarisation were stimulated with interleukin (IL)-4. BMDM morphology and phagocytosis were observed by laser confocal microscopy;levels of BMDM differentiation and cluster of differentiation (CD)11c or CD206 on the membrane surface were assessed by flow cytometry (FCM);mRNA and protein levels of M1/M2-type inflammatory factors were performed by qPCR and ELISA, respectively;and the expression of p-STAT1 and p-STAT6 protein pathways was detected by Western-blotting. Results The isolated mouse bone marrow cells were successfully differentiated into BMDMs, LPS + IFN-γ induced BMDM M1-phenotype polarisation, and IL-4 induced M2-phenotype polarisation. After M1-polarised BMDMs were treated with luteolin, the phagocytosis of M1-polarized BMDMs was reduced, and the M1-type pro-inflammatory factors including IL-6, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and CD86 were downregulated while the M2-type anti-inflammatory factors including IL-10, IL-13, found in inflammatory zone (FIZZ)1, Arginase (Arg)1 and CD206 were upregulated. Additionally, the expression of M1-type surface marker CD11c decreased. Nevertheless, the M2-type marker CD206 increased;and the levels of inflammatory signalling proteins phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription (p-STAT)1 and p-STAT6 were attenuated and enhanced, respectively. Conclusions Our study suggests that luteolin may transform BMDM polarity through p-STAT1/6 to regulate the expression of inflammatory mediators, thereby inhibiting inflammation. Naturally occurring luteolin holds promise as an anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory agent.","Wang, Shuxia Xu Shuhang Zhou Jing Zhang Li Mao Xiaodong Yao Xiaoming Liu Chao",Journal of Inflammation,596,20

METHODS: Qualitative, descriptive and exploratory study with theoretical framework in the psychodynamics of work, carried out in the emergency and hospitalization sector of a national reference center for cancer treatment in Rio de Janeiro/Brazil. The semi-structured interview was used to collect the data, from April to May 2020. The data were organized and analyzed using the Collective Subject Discourse (CSD) method with the aid of the Qualiquantisoft® software. RESULTS: Twenty members of the nursing team participated (10 nurses and 10 nursing technicians). After the analysis, three CSDs with their respective central ideas (CI) emerged. The CSD software, Qualiquantisoft®, also provided a quantitative analysis of the responses, in which 12 (60%) of the respondents believe that the main stressors are associated with work organization, 6 (30%) of the respondents believe that the main stressors are associated to work relationships and 2 (10%) of respondents believe that the main stressors are associated with working conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The adaptations that took place in the management of care and in the organization of work, to better serve patients in oncology palliative care with suspicions and confirmed for COVID-19, brought greater impact and psychological stress on the nursing team. Considering all the difficulties and influences that the nursing team members are facing in this pandemic moment by COVID-19 associated with palliative oncology care, it is believed that identifying the source of the psychological stress presented by them may contribute to them have a more effective, humanized and holistic care, in addition to spreading knowledge to nursing and other segments of the health area and bringing subsidies to other scientific productions, as well as highlighting the importance of early detection of psychological stress as a way of preventing impacts physical and psychosocial problems caused by work.","de Azeredo Siqueira, Alex Sandro; Teixeira, Enéas Rangel; de Oliveira da Cunha, Daianny Arrais; Barcellos Santiago, Fernanda; Ferraz Kirby, Endi Evelin; Lima Neves, Luciene Miguel",Ann. palliat. med.

METHODS: Between June 2019 and November 2019, a survey amongst consecutive regular orthopedic and orthopedic trauma patients at the outpatient clinics from three European level I trauma centers was conducted via paper-based questionnaires, composed of participants` demographics as well as five open and closed questions. Participation was voluntary and anonymity was granted. RESULTS: In total, 780 participants (female 302, 38.7%, male 478, 61.3%) with a mean age of 43.8 years (SD 17.1, range from 14 years to 94 years) were included. The majority of the participants (57,6%) were eager to use a remote consultation. Participants with an age of more than 55 years were significantly less likely to use a remote consultation than their younger counterparts (OR= 0.18, p=0.003. r2=0.141). Among the whole study population, 86.2% stated, that they had a device compatible with an online video consultation. The highest willingness to conduct a video consultation in respect of the participants` occupation was observed in ""part-time""-jobs (70.6%), whereas the lowest disposition was seen in retired patients (37.1%) (p= 0.0001). The most stated reason why to conduct a video consultation was ""communication of medical findings"" (67.8%). The most stated advantage was the ""reduction of physical consultations"" (66.4%). ""No physical examination"" was the most frequently stated disadvantage (75.9%). CONCLUSION: The majority of orthopedic and orthopedic trauma outpatients would use a video consultation, especially because of commuting and time issues and ideally to communicate medical findings, such as x-ray reports or lab values. Elderly patients appear to be less eager in regard to video consultations. These results may change for even better acceptance in view of a current pandemic situation, as experienced since early 2020. We feel that this assumption may warrant further investigation.","Scherer, Julian; Osterhoff, Georg; Kaufmann, Ernest; Estel, Katharina; Neuhaus, Valentin; Willy, Christian; Hepp, Pierre; Pape, Hans-Christoph; Back, David A",Injury,596,4

We set out to investigate if the total blood plasma of patients who had recovered from acute respiratory distress as a result of COVID-19, contained more glycated HSA and higher mass (glycosylated/glycated) IgG3 than those with only clinically mild or asymptomatic infections. A direct dilution and disulphide bond reduction method was development and applied to plasma samples from SARS-CoV2 seronegative (N = 30) and seropositive (N = 31) healthcare workers and 38 convalescent plasma samples from patients who had been admitted with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with COVID-19. Patients recovering from COVID-19 ARDS had significantly higher mass, AGE-glycated HSA and higher mass IgG3 levels. This would indicate that increased levels and/or ratios of hyper-glycosylation (probably terminal sialic acid) IgG3 and AGE glycated HSA may be predisposition markers for development of ARDS as a result of COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, rapid direct analysis of plasma samples by MALDI-ToF MS for such humoral immune correlates of COVID-19 presents a feasible screening technology for the most at risk; regardless of age or known health conditions.

We test: (1) Whether global aging narratives have become more negative from before to during the pandemic (Oct'19 to May'20) across 20 countries; (2) Model pandemic (incidence and mortality), and cultural factors associated with the trajectory of aging narratives. METHODS: We leveraged a 10-billion-word online-media corpus, consisting of 28 million newspaper and magazine articles across 20 countries, to identify nine common synonyms of 'older adults' and compiled their most frequently-used descriptors (collocates) from Oct'19 to May'20-culminating in 11,504 collocates that were rated to create a Cumulative-Aging-Narrative-Score-(CANS) per month. Widely used cultural dimension scores were taken from Hofstede, and pandemic variables, from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker. RESULTS: Aging narratives became more negative as the pandemic worsened across 20 countries. Globally, scores were trending neutral from Oct'19 to Feb'20, and plummeted in Mar'20, reflecting COVID-19's severity. Pre-pandemic (Oct'19), UK evidenced the most negative aging narratives; peak-pandemic (May'20), South Africa took on the dubious honor. Across the 8-month period, Philippines experienced the steepest trend towards negativity in aging narratives. Ageism, during the pandemic, was ironically, not predicted by COVID-19's incidence and mortality rates, but by cultural variables: Individualism, Masculinity, Uncertainty Avoidance, and Long-term Orientation.

Traditional care for patients with diabetes and diabetic retinopathy is fragmented, uncoordinated and delivered in a piecemeal nature, often in the most expensive and high-resource tertiary settings. Transformative new models incorporating digital technology are needed to address these gaps in clinical care. RECENT FINDINGS: Artificial intelligence and telehealth may improve access, financial sustainability and coverage of diabetic retinopathy screening programs. They enable risk stratifying patients based on individual risk of vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy including diabetic macular edema (DME), and predicting which patients with DME best respond to antivascular endothelial growth factor therapy. SUMMARY: Progress in artificial intelligence and tele-ophthalmology for diabetic retinopathy screening, including artificial intelligence applications in 'real-world settings' and cost-effectiveness studies are summarized. Furthermore, the initial research on the use of artificial intelligence models for diabetic retinopathy risk stratification and management of DME are outlined along with potential future directions. Finally, the need for artificial intelligence adoption within ophthalmology in response to coronavirus disease 2019 is discussed. Digital health solutions such as artificial intelligence and telehealth can facilitate the integration of community, primary and specialist eye care services, optimize the flow of patients within healthcare networks, and improve the efficiency of diabetic retinopathy management.","Gunasekeran, Dinesh V; Ting, Daniel S W; Tan, Gavin S W; Wong, Tien Y",Curr Opin Ophthalmol,596,2

We analyzed 184 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in Livingston, New Jersey for clinical characteristics associated with severe disease. The majority of patients with COVID-19 had diabetes mellitus (DM) (62.0%), Pre-DM (23.9%) with elevated fasting blood glucose (FBG), or a body mass index >30 with normal hemoglobin A1c (HbA1C) (4.3%). SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with new and persistent hyperglycemia in 29 patients, including several with normal HbA1C levels. Forty-four patients required intubation, which occurred significantly more often in patients with DM as compared with non-diabetics. Severe COVID-19 occurs in the presence of impaired glucose metabolism in patients, including those with DM, preDM, and obesity. COVID-19 is associated with elevated FBG and several patients presented with new onset DM or in DKA. The association of dysregulated glucose metabolism and severe COVID-19 suggests that SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis involves a novel interplay with glucose metabolism. Exploration of pathways by which SARS-CoV-2 interacts glucose metabolism is critical for understanding disease pathogenesis and developing therapies.","Smith, Stephen M; Boppana, Avinash; Traupman, Julie A; Unson, Enrique; Maddock, Daniel A; Chao, Kathy; Dobesh, David P; Brufsky, Adam; Connor, Ruth I",J. med. virol,596,20

CKD patients are at high risk of being exposed to COVID-19 and suffer complications and poor outcome. In Sweden, mitigation strategies did not include lockdown. During March-April of 2020, wide-spread infection occurred in Stockholm. METHODS: Management and outcomes in forty hemodialysis (HD) patients and 4 peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients, with symptomatic COVID-19 in greater Stockholm during March and April of 2020 are reported. RESULTS: Twenty-four HD patients (60%) required medical care and hospitalization, whereas 16 patients (40%) were treated at home. Nine patients died (mortality rate of 22.5%), of whom 8 were men. The median age in non-survivors (78 years) was significantly higher than in survivors (p = 0.003). The median time in dialysis (11.5 years) was also significantly longer in non-survivors (p = 0.01). C-reactive protein (CRP) at diagnosis in 7 of non-survivors (median 213 mg/L, range 86-329 mg/L) was significantly higher than the CRP in 25 survivors (median 87 mg/L, range 1-328 mg/L) (p = 0.0003). Maximum CRP also indicated poorer outcome among hospitalized patients (p = 0.0004). The gender imbalance was striking with only men dying apart from 1 elderly woman. Only 4 PD patients were hospitalized with symptomatic COVID-19. One patient died, 2 were discharged, and 1 was treated at the intensive care unit and survived. CONCLUSION: HD patients >70 years were reported with longer dialysis vintage, higher CRP, and males were at an increased risk of dying from COVID-19, whereas those <70 years seemed to have a milder disease. Mitigation strategies to reduce rates of infection in high-risk populations remain essential. Follow-up focusing on long-term prognosis for extrapulmonary manifestations is likely to be important also in dialysis patients.","Smolander, Jessica; Bruchfeld, Annette",Kidney Blood Press Res,596,17

Yet, little is known about getting out in this population. Here, our objectives are to: 1) identify residents' opportunities for, and experiences with, getting out; 2) understand the significance of getting out; and 3) explain influential factors. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Guided by grounded theory methods, we analyzed qualitative data collected over a one-year period in four diverse assisted living communities. We followed 33 residents with dementia and their care partners. Data include detailed fieldnotes capturing 1,560 observation hours, 114 interviews with residents (where possible), assisted living staff, family members, and other visitors, and record review. RESULTS: We identified the centrality of ""being out in the world and negotiating connections,"" which characterizes residents' experiences with the outside world as a process of 'working out' engagement with nature, others, and the community. Being out in the world was consequential to well-being and quality of life. Most residents got out at least occasionally; some lacked opportunities. Among residents who got out, most benefitted from ensuing connections. Yet, not all experiences were positive. Being out in the world varied over time and by individual-, convoy-, AL community-, and neighborhood-level factors.

Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted to investigate the HRQoL of pediatric medical staff. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression were used to analyze the associated factors. Results: A total of 2,997 participants were recruited. Females scored worse than males in terms of emotional functioning (OR = 1.6, 95% CI: 1.2-2.1) and cognitive functioning (OR = 1.4, 95% CI: 1.1-1.8). The respondents aged 30-39 and 40-49 years scored worse in nearly all domains of HRQoL compared health care professionals under 30 years old.

Often, similar reforms are introduced concomitantly across countries. Although national policymakers would benefit from considering reform experiences abroad, exchange is limited. This paper provides an overview of health reform trends in 31 high-income countries in 2018 and 2019, i.e., before Covid-19. METHODS: Information was collected from national experts from the Health Systems and Policy Monitor network. Experts were asked to report on the three ""top"" national health reforms 2018 and 2019. In 2019, they provided an update of 2018 reforms. Reforms were assigned to one of 11 clusters and identified as one of seven different reform types. RESULTS: 81 reforms were reported in 28 countries in 2018. 44/81 went to four clusters: 'insurance coverage & resource generation', 'governance', 'healthcare purchasing & payment', and 'organisation of hospital care'. In 2019, 86 reforms in 30 countries were reported. 48/86 fell under 'organisation of primary & ambulatory care', 'governance', 'care coordination & specialised care', and 'organisation of hospital care'. Most 2018 reforms were reported ongoing in 2019; 27 implemented; seven abandoned. Health agency-led reforms were implemented most frequently, followed by central government-legislated reforms. CONCLUSIONS: Policymakers can leverage international experience of distinct reform approaches addressing similar challenges and similar approaches to address distinct problems. Such knowledge may help inspire or support future successful health reform processes.","Polin, Katherine; Hjortland, Maximilien; Maresso, Anna; van Ginneken, Ewout; Busse, Reinhard; Quentin, Wilm",Health Policy,596,15
341221,341221,341221,Long COVID and the role of physical activity: a qualitative study,20.143175,6.530092,2021,"AIMS: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a spate of studies showing a close connection between inequitable access to health care, welfare services and adverse outcomes from the pandemic. Others have argued that democratic governments have generally failed relative to more autocratic ones, simply because autocrats can make the hard choices required for stemming the spread of viruses. We address this question by asking whether more 'egalitarian' forms of democracy matter, given that they contain more equitable health-care access and societal infrastructure, such as social capital and trust. METHODS: We use standard regression techniques, including instrumental variables analysis addressing endogeneity on COVID-19 testing and deaths data as of the end of May and beginning of September. We use novel data from the Varieties of Democracy Project on health-system equity and egalitarian democracy. RESULTS: Our results suggest that more equitable access to health care increases testing rates and lowers the death rate from COVID-19. Broader egalitarian governance, measured as egalitarian democracy, however, shows the opposite effect. Thus, factors associated with health-care capacity to reach and treat matter more than broader societal factors associated with social capital and trust. The results are robust to alternative testing procedures, including instrumental variable technique for addressing potential endogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a great deal of public health focus on how equitable governance helps fight the adverse effects of so-called neoliberal pandemics, we find that broadly egalitarian factors have had the opposite effect on fighting COVID-19, especially when an equitable health system has been taken into account. Fighting disease, thus, might be more about the capacity of health systems rather than societal factors, such as trust in government and social capital.","Vadlamannati, Krishna Chaitanya; Cooray, Arusha; de Soysa, Indra",Scand J Public Health,596,10

One patient with seronegative polyarticular JIA, previously prescribed methotrexate and receiving leflunomide during pandemic was identified to be diagnosed with COVID-19. None, including the confirmed case, had any severe symptoms. More than half of the patients with household exposure did not require hospitalization as they were asymptomatic.

For this meta-analysis, PubMed, CENTRAL, and grey literature were searched from their inception to 19 May 2020 for randomized, controlled trials or observational studies that evaluate the association between the use of either ACE inhibitors or ARBs and the risk for major clinical endpoints (infection, hospitalization, admission to ICU, death) in adult patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, a subgroup geographical analysis of outcomes was performed. Studies including less than 100 subjects were excluded from our analysis. RECENT FINDINGS: In total, 25 observational studies were included. ACE inhibitors and ARBs were not associated with increased odds for SARS-CoV-2 infection, admission to hospital, severe or critical illness, admission to ICU, and SARS-CoV-2-related death. In Asian countries, the use of ACE inhibitors/ARBs decreased the odds for severe or critical illness and death (OR = 0.37, 95% CI 0.16-0.89, I2 = 83%, and OR = 0.62, 95% CI 0.39-0.99, I2 = 0%, respectively), whereas they increased the odds for ICU admission in North America and death in Europe (OR = 1.75, 95% CI 1.37-2.23, I2 = 0%, and OR = 1.68, 95% CI 1.05-2.70, I2 = 82%, respectively). ACE inhibitors might be marginally protective regarding SARS-CoV-2-related death compared with ARBs (OR = 0.86, 95% CI 0.74-1.00, I2 = 0%). Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the aforementioned associations between ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and SARS-CoV-2.","Patoulias, Dimitrios; Katsimardou, Alexandra; Stavropoulos, Konstantinos; Imprialos, Konstantinos; Kalogirou, Maria-Styliani; Doumas, Michael",Curr Hypertens Rep,596,5

One way to address this challenge is to first build a non-negative and unbiased estimate of the likelihood -- involving the matrix exponential of finite truncations of the true rate matrix -- and then to use the estimates in a pseudo-marginal inference method. In this work, we show that we can dramatically increase the efficiency of this approach by avoiding the computation of exact matrix exponentials. In particular, we develop a general methodology for constructing an unbiased, non-negative estimate of the likelihood using doubly-monotone matrix exponential approximations. We further develop a novel approximation in this family -- the skeletoid -- as well as theory regarding its approximation error and how that relates to the variance of the estimates used in pseudo-marginal inference. Experimental results show that our approach yields more efficient posterior inference for a wide variety of CTMCs.","Biron-Lattes, Miguel; Bouchard-Cot'e, Alexandre; Campbell, Trevor",,596,25

An ad hoc multidisciplinary group was created to address the major public health implications of this messaging. Key messages of this commentary are as follows: 1) The COVID-19 crisis may increase tobacco consumption and decrease access to healthcare. As a result, smoking-related morbidity and mortality could increase in the coming months and years; 2) Smoking and tobacco-related diseases are prognostic factors for severe COVID-19; and 3) In theory, smokers may be at lower risk of COVID-19 infection because of having fewer social contacts. In conclusion, tobacco control is a greater challenge than ever in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Public decision-makers must be vigilant in ensuring that public health practices are consistent and compliant with the principles of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. In addition, researchers and the media have a responsibility to be cautious in communicating preliminary results that may promote non-evidence-based research, self-destructive individual behaviours, and commercial agendas.","Alla, François; Berlin, Ivan; Nguyen-Thanh, Viet; Guignard, Romain; Pasquereau, Anne; Quelet, Sylvie; Schwarzinger, Michaël; Arwidson, Pierre",Can J Public Health,596,16

The extent and type of pulmonary involvement, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and pleural effusion were assessed. Cross-sectional areas and attenuation by paravertebral muscles were measured on axial CT images at the T5 and T12 vertebral level. Multivariable linear and binary logistic regression, including calculation of odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs, were used to build four models to predict ICU admission and death, which were tested and compared by using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Results A total of 552 patients (364 men and 188 women; median age, 65 years [interquartile range, 54-75 years]) were included.

Vitamin D supplementation has been suggested as a potential option to prevent COVID-19 infections, severe courses, and deaths from the disease, but is not widely practiced. This article provides an up-to-date summary of recent epidemiological and intervention studies on a possible role of vitamin D supplementation for preventing severe COVID-19 cases and deaths. Despite limitations and remaining uncertainties, accumulating evidence strongly supports widespread vitamin D supplementation, in particular of high-risk populations, as well as high-dose supplementation of those infected. Given the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic, the benefit-risk ratio of such supplementation calls for immediate action even before results of ongoing large-scale randomized trials become available.","Brenner, Hermann",Nutrients,596,30

A severe course with fatal outcome is possible and unpredictable. OBJECTIVES: Which organ systems are predominantly involved? Which diseases are predisposed for a fatal course? Which organ changes are found with lethal outcome? MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from published autopsy studies (28 cases by our group) with respect to organ changes and possible cause of death. RESULTS: The most severe alterations are found in the lungs by diffuse alveolar damage as a symptom of an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), in part with fibrosis. Thrombosis of small- to mid-sized pulmonary arteries is associated with hemorrhagic lung infarction. Frequent complications are bacterial pneumonias and less frequently fungal pneumonias by aspergillus. Pulmonary thromboembolism is found in 20-30% of lethal courses, also in the absence of deep venous thrombosis. Intestinal involvement of COVID-19 can be associated with intestinal ischemia, caused by shock or local thrombosis. In most cases, the kidneys display acute tubular injury reflecting acute renal failure, depletion of lymphocytes in the lymph nodes and spleen, and hyperplastic adrenal glands. The liver frequently reveals steatosis, liver cell necrosis, portal inflammation, and proliferation of Kupffer cells. Important preexisting diseases in autopsy studies are arterial hypertension with hypertensive and ischemic cardiomyopathy and diabetes mellitus but large population-based studies reveal increased risk of mortality only for diabetes mellitus not for arterial hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: Alterations of the pulmonary circulation with pulmonary arterial thrombosis, infarction, and bacterial pneumonia are important and often lethal complications of COVID-19-associated ARDS. Findings from autopsy studies have influenced therapy and prophylaxis.","Lax, Sigurd F; Skok, Kristijan; Zechner, Peter M; Setaffy, Lisa; Kessler, Harald H; Kaufmann, Norbert; Vander, Klaus; Cokic, Natalija; Maierhofer, Ursa; Bargfrieder, Ute; Trauner, Michael",Pathologe,596,24

METHODS: We identified 48 440 adult patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis from 1 January 2020 to 21 October 2020, with at least three exercise vital sign measurements from 19 March 2018 to 18 March 2020. We linked each patient's self-reported physical activity category (consistently inactive=0-10 min/week, some activity=11-149 min/week, consistently meeting guidelines=150+ min/week) to the risk of hospitalisation, ICU admission and death after COVID-19 diagnosis. We conducted multivariable logistic regression controlling for demographics and known risk factors to assess whether inactivity was associated with COVID-19 outcomes. RESULTS: Patients with COVID-19 who were consistently inactive had a greater risk of hospitalisation (OR 2.26; 95% CI 1.81 to 2.83), admission to the ICU (OR 1.73; 95% CI 1.18 to 2.55) and death (OR 2.49; 95% CI 1.33 to 4.67) due to COVID-19 than patients who were consistently meeting physical activity guidelines. Patients who were consistently inactive also had a greater risk of hospitalisation (OR 1.20; 95% CI 1.10 to 1.32), admission to the ICU (OR 1.10; 95% CI 0.93 to 1.29) and death (OR 1.32; 95% CI 1.09 to 1.60) due to COVID-19 than patients who were doing some physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: Consistently meeting physical activity guidelines was strongly associated with a reduced risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes among infected adults. We recommend efforts to promote physical activity be prioritised by public health agencies and incorporated into routine medical care.","Sallis, Robert; Young, Deborah Rohm; Tartof, Sara Y; Sallis, James F; Sall, Jeevan; Li, Qiaowu; Smith, Gary N; Cohen, Deborah A",Br. j. sports med,596,26

The misinformation riding upon the infodemic wave poses a major threat to people's health and governance systems. Since social media is the largest source of information, managing the infodemic not only requires mitigating of misinformation but also an early understanding of psychological patterns resulting from it. During the COVID-19 crisis, Twitter alone has seen a sharp 45% increase in the usage of its curated events page, and a 30% increase in its direct messaging usage, since March 6th 2020. In this study, we analyze the psychometric impact and coupling of the COVID-19 infodemic with the official bulletins related to COVID-19 at the national and state level in India. We look at these two sources with a psycho-linguistic lens of emotions and quantified the extent and coupling between the two. We modified path, a deep skip-gram based open-sourced lexicon builder for effective capture of health-related emotions. We were then able to capture the time-evolution of health-related emotions in social media and official bulletins. An analysis of lead-lag relationships between the time series of extracted emotions from official bulletins and social media using Granger's causality showed that state bulletins were leading the social media for some emotions such as Medical Emergency. Further insights that are potentially relevant for the policymaker and the communicators actively engaged in mitigating misinformation are also discussed. Our paper also introduces CoronaIndiaDataset2, the first social media based COVID-19 dataset at national and state levels from India with over 5.6 million national and 2.6 million state-level tweets. Finally, we present our findings as COVibes, an interactive web application capturing psychometric insights captured upon the CoronaIndiaDataset, both at a national and state level.","Jolly, Baani Leen Kaur; Aggrawal, Palash; Gulati, Amogh; Sethi, Amarjit Singh; Kumaraguru, Ponnurangam; Sethi, Tavpritesh",,596,16

We sought to comprehensively screen for secondary infections by DNA pathogens (bacterial, fungal or viral) with a non-invasive, culture-independent metagenomic approach (microbial cell-free DNA sequencing-mcfDNA-Seq), and also examine for the biologic impact of circulating mcfDNA on the host response in COVID-19. Methods: We prospectively enrolled 42 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and compared them with a historical cohort of mechanically-ventilated patients with culture-positive (n=27) vs. culture-negative pneumonia (n=40) or no clinical infection (n=16 controls). From plasma samples, we performed mcfDNA-Seq with the Karius test (Karius, Inc) and measured 10 host-response biomarkers of innate immunity and epithelial/endothelial injury (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, RAGE, TNFR1, Angiopoietin-2, Procalcitonin, Fractalkine, Pentraxin-3, ST2). We compared mcfDNA-Seq between clinical groups and examined associations of mcfDNA and biomarker levels with linear regression models. Results: McfDNA-Seq was successful in 33/42 (79%) baseline samples from patients with COVID-19, with nine samples failing QC requirements. McfDNA was detectable in 21/33 (64%) of COVID-19 samples, a proportion significantly lower to culture-positive pneumonia (96%), higher than uninfected controls (31%) and similar to culture-negative pneumonia (56%) (between-groups Fisher's exact p&lt;0.001). A similar distribution was seen for mcfDNA levels, with mcfDNA load in COVID-19 being similarly distributed as non-COVID culture-negative pneumonia (Figure 1A). Among patients with COVID-19, mcfDNA was significantly associated with higher levels of host-response biomarkers (Figure 1B), with stronger effect sizes observed for biomarkers of innate immunity (IL-8 and ST2) and bacterial infections (procalcitonin and pentraxin-3). Conclusions: Plasma metagenomics in patients with COVID-19 revealed mcfDNA load of similar magnitude as in critically-ill patients without COVID-19 with clinically suspected infection but negative microbiologic cultures. The significant associations of mcfDNA with host inflammation support the biological relevance of detectable circulating mcfDNA. Our preliminary results warrant further study of secondary infections in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 to define the clinical utility of noninvasive molecular diagnostics for antimicrobial treatment guidance.","Lisius, G.; Yang, H.; Duttagupta, R.; Ahmed, A.; Al-Yousif, N.; Schaefer, C.; Bensen, N.; Lu, M.; Methe, B.; Bain, W.; McVerry, B.

However, to date, the trend of hospitalizations in the oncology patient population has not been studied, and the frequency of nosocomial spread to patients with cancer is not well understood. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on inpatient oncology census and determine the nosocomial rate of COVID-19 in patients with cancer admitted at a large academic center. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical records of patients with cancer diagnosed with COVID-19 and admitted were reviewed to evaluate the temporal trends in inpatient oncology census during pre-COVID-19 (January 2019 to February 2020), COVID-19 (March to May 2020), and post-COVID-19 surge (June to August 2020) in the region. In addition, nosocomial infection rates of SARS-CoV-2 were reviewed. RESULTS: Overall, the daily inpatient census was steady in 2019 (median, 103; range, 92-118) and until February 2020 (median, 112; range, 102-114). However, there was a major decline from March to May 2020 (median, 68; range, 57-104), with 45.4% lower admissions during April 2020. As the COVID-19 surge eased, the daily inpatient census over time returned to the pre-COVID-19 baseline (median, 103; range, 99-111). One patient (1/231, 0.004%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 13 days after hospitalization, and it is unclear if it was nosocomial or community spread. CONCLUSION: In this study, inpatient oncology admissions decreased substantially during the COVID-19 surge but over time returned to the pre-COVID-19 baseline. With aggressive infection control measures, the rates of nosocomial transmission were exceedingly low and should provide reassurance to those seeking medical care, including inpatient admissions when medically necessary. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on the health care system, and cancer patients are a vulnerable population. This study observes a significant decline in the daily inpatient oncology census from March to May 2020 compared with the same time frame in the previous year and examines the potential reasons for this decline. In addition, nosocomial rates of COVID-19 were investigated, and rates were found to be very low. These findings suggest that aggressive infection control measures can mitigate the nosocomial infection risk among cancer patients and the inpatient setting is a safe environment, providing reassurance.","Zubiri, Leyre; Rosovsky, Rachel P; Mooradian, Meghan J; Piper-Vallillo, A J; Gainor, Justin F; Sullivan, Ryan J; Marte, Daniel; Boland, Genevieve M; Gao, Xin; Hochberg, Ephraim P; Ryan, David P; McEwen, Corey; Mai, Minh; Sharova, Tanya; Soumerai, Tara E; Bardia, Aditya; Reynolds, Kerry L",Oncologist,596,18

Although human transmission of the virus through the respiratory tract of close contact people with dromedary reported previously, the exact mechanism of transmission is still largely unknown. The main goal of this study was to check the possibility of MERS-CoV shedding in the exhaled air of the infected camels. To achieve this goal, we conducted a follow-up study in one of the dromedary camel herds, December 2018-April 2019. We tested nasal swabs, breath samples from animals within this herd by the real-time PCR. Our results showed that some of the tested nasal swabs and breath were positive from 24 March 2019 until 7 April 2019. The phylogenetic analysis of the obtained S and N gene sequences revealed the detected viruses are clustering together with some human and camel samples from the eastern region, especially from Al-Hufuf city, as well as some samples from Qatar and Jordon. These results are clearly showing the possibility of shedding of the virus in the breath of the infected camels. This could explain, at least in part, the mechanism of transmission of MERS-CoV from animals to humans. This study is confirming the shedding of MERS-CoV in the exhaled air of the infected camels. Further studies are needed for a better understanding of the MERS-CoV.","Hemida, Maged Gomaa; Ali, Mohammed; Alhammadi, Mohammed; Alnaeem, Abdelmohsen",Epidemiol Infect,596,16

We conduct a systematic review of 851 records and construct a final article sample of 183 for the sample period 2012 to 2020 to identify relevant factors for blockchain adoption in corporate governance. We conduct textual and empirical analysis to develop a decentralized autonomous governance framework and link traditional corporate governance theories to blockchain adoption. Furthermore, we explore present and future use cases and implications of blockchains in corporate governance. Using our systematic review and textual analysis, we further identify gaps and common trends between prior academic and industry literature. Moreover, for our empirical analysis, we compile a unique database of blockchain investments to forecast future investments. In addition, we explore blockchain potential in corporate governance during and post COVID-19. We find prior academic articles to mostly focus on regulation (49 studies) and Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) (46 studies), while industry articles tend to concentrate on exchanges (10 studies) and cryptocurrencies (9 articles). A significant growth in literature is observed for 2017 and 2018.

A particularly important aspect is the development of medication. In addition to viral proteins, structured RNA elements represent a potent alternative as drug targets. The search for drugs that target RNA requires their high-resolution structural characterization. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, a worldwide consortium of NMR researchers aims to characterize potential RNA drug targets of SCoV2. Here, we report the characterization of 15 conserved RNA elements located at the 5' end, the ribosomal frameshift segment and the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of the SCoV2 genome, their large-scale production and NMR-based secondary structure determination. The NMR data are corroborated with secondary structure probing by DMS footprinting experiments. The close agreement of NMR secondary structure determination of isolated RNA elements with DMS footprinting and NMR performed on larger RNA regions shows that the secondary structure elements fold independently. The NMR data reported here provide the basis for NMR investigations of RNA function, RNA interactions with viral and host proteins and screening campaigns to identify potential RNA binders for pharmaceutical intervention.","Wacker, Anna; Weigand, Julia E; Akabayov, Sabine R; Altincekic, Nadide; Bains, Jasleen Kaur; Banijamali, Elnaz; Binas, Oliver; Castillo-Martinez, Jesus; Cetiner, Erhan; Ceylan, Betül; Chiu, Liang-Yuan; Davila-Calderon, Jesse; Dhamotharan, Karthikeyan; Duchardt-Ferner, Elke; Ferner, Jan; Frydman, Lucio; Fürtig, Boris; Gallego, José; Grün, J Tassilo; Hacker, Carolin; Haddad, Christina; Hähnke, Martin; Hengesbach, Martin; Hiller, Fabian; Hohmann, Katharina F; Hymon, Daniel; de Jesus, Vanessa; Jonker, Henry; Keller, Heiko; Knezic, Bozana; Landgraf, Tom; Löhr, Frank; Luo, Le; Mertinkus, Klara R; Muhs, Christina; Novakovic, Mihajlo; Oxenfarth, Andreas; Palomino-Schätzlein, Martina; Petzold, Katja; Peter, Stephen A; Pyper, Dennis J; Qureshi, Nusrat S; Riad, Magdalena; Richter, Christian; Saxena, Krishna; Schamber, Tatjana; Scherf, Tali; Schlagnitweit, Judith; Schlundt, Andreas; Schnieders, Robbin",Nucleic Acids Res,596,16

Here, we present two cases of suspected remdesivir-associated acute liver failure (ALF) in which the liver failure improved after continuous infusion acetylcysteine and withdrawal of remdesivir. Both patients had significant increases in transaminases between day 3 and day 10 of remdesivir therapy accompanied by coagulopathy and encephalopathy. After initiation of continuous infusion acetylcysteine, the transaminases of both patients rapidly improved. Ultimately, one patient fully recovered while the other died of suspected septic shock. Due to its novel nature and only recent widespread use, there are very little data on the risk of ALF from remdesivir. Additionally, the data for the use of acetylcysteine to manage non-acetaminophen-induced ALF are limited. It is important to consider the risk of remdesivir-associated ALF when weighing the risk versus benefits of use, and acetylcysteine may have a role in its management.","Carothers, Chancey; Birrer, Kara; Vo, Mai",Pharmacotherapy,596,30

Between February 5, 2020 and March 10, 2020, a total of 16 mobile cabin hospitals were constructed in 3 batches to offer over 13,000 beds and admitted more than 12,000 patients in Wuhan City. The strategy of implementing WMCHs in 3 batches played a key role in fighting against COVID-19 in China. (1) The first batch of WMCHs increased hospital admission capacity of COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, which showed initial effect on COVID-19 epidemic control. (2) The operation of the second batch of WMCHs greatly contributed to the rapid growth in discharged patients. (3) After launching the third batch of WMCHs, the COVID-19 epidemic situation in Wuhan improved considerably. The last batch of WMCHs made a substantial contribution to defeating the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan.","Zhang, Yuyao; Shi, Leiyu; Cao, Yidan; Chen, Haiqian; Wang, Xiaohan; Sun, Gang",Medicine (Baltimore),596,2

To rigorously evaluate how these measures have affected air quality in Europe, we developed Bayesian spatio-temporal (BST) models that assess changes in the surface nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration across the continent. We fitted BST models to measurements of the two pollutants in 2020 using a lockdown indicator covariate, while accounting for the spatial and temporal correlation present in the data. Since other factors, such as weather conditions, local combustion sources and/or land surface characteristics may contribute to the variation of pollutant concentrations, we proposed two model formulations that allowed the differentiation between the variations in pollutant concentrations due to seasonality from the variations associated to the lockdown policies. The first model compares the changes in 2020, with the ones during the same period in the previous five years, by introducing an offset term, which controls for the long-term average concentrations of each pollutant during 2014–2019. The second approach models only the 2020 data, but adjusts for confounding factors. The results indicated that the latter can better capture the lockdown effect. The measures taken to tackle the virus in Europe reduced the average surface concentrations of NO2 and PM2.5 by 29.5% (95% Bayesian credible interval: 28.1%, 30.9%) and 25.9% (23.6%, 28.1%), respectively. To our knowledge, this research is the first to account for the spatio-temporal correlation present in the monitoring data during the pandemic and to assess how it affects estimation of the lockdown effect while accounting for confounding. The proposed methodology improves our understanding of the effect of COVID-19 lockdown policies on the air pollution burden across the continent.","Beloconi, Anton Probst-Hensch Nicole M.; Vounatsou, Penelope",Science of The Total Environment,596,24

The binding affinity and the number of hot-spot residues, atomic contacts, and H-bond formations of the SFG/nsp16 complex were distinctly higher than those of the SAH/nsp16 system, consistent with the lower water accessibility at the enzyme active site. Notably, only SFG could electrostatically interact with the 2'-OH and N3 groups of RNA's adenosine moiety, mimicking the methyl transfer reaction of S-adenosyl-L-methionine substrate. The atomistic binding mechanism obtained from this work paves the way for further optimizations and designs of more specific SARS-CoV-2 nsp16 inhibitors in the fight against COVID-19.","Mahalapbutr, Panupong; Kongtaworn, Napat; Rungrotmongkol, Thanyada",,596,7

As noted in other states, an unintended consequence of these activities was significant declines in childhood immunizations. After analyzing state-wide immunization register data for Texas, we observed a 47% relative decline in immunization rates between 2019 and 2020 among 5-month-olds and a 58% decline among 16-month-olds. We observed a small decline (5%) among 24-month-olds, and no decline in vaccines received at birth (Hepatitis B). Declines were larger in rural counties compared to urban. These declines are superimposed on increases in state vaccine exemptions over the last five years due to an aggressive anti-vaccine movement in Texas. There are concerns that continued declines in childhood immunization coverage due to COVID-19 could lead to co-endemics of measles and other vaccine preventable diseases.","Nuzhath, Tasmiah; Ajayi, Kobi V; Fan, Qiping; Hotez, Peter; Colwell, Brian; Callaghan, Timothy; Regan, Annette K",Vaccine,596,16

METHODS: We conducted an interrupted time-series (lockdown on 23 March 2020 as point of interruption) analysis in asthma cohort identified using a validated algorithm from a national-level primary care database, the Optimum Patient Care Database. We derived asthma exacerbation rates for every week and compared exacerbation rates in the period: January to August 2020 with a pre-COVID-19 period and January to August 2016-2019. Exacerbations were defined as asthma-related hospital attendance/admission (including accident and emergency visit), or an acute course of oral corticosteroids with evidence of respiratory review, as recorded in primary care. We used a generalised least squares modelling approach and stratified the analyses by age, sex, English region and healthcare setting. RESULTS: From a database of 9 949 387 patients, there were 100 165 patients with asthma who experienced at least one exacerbation during 2016-2020. Of 278 996 exacerbation episodes, 49 938 (17.9%) required hospital visit. Comparing pre-lockdown to post-lockdown period, we observed a statistically significant reduction in the level (-0.196 episodes per person-year; p<0.001; almost 20 episodes for every 100 patients with asthma per year) of exacerbation rates across all patients. The reductions in level in stratified analyses were: 0.005-0.244 (healthcare setting, only those without hospital attendance/admission were significant), 0.210-0.277 (sex), 0.159-0.367 (age), 0.068-0.590 (region).

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to describe the rate of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and its determinants among HCWs. DATA SOURCES: We used Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, MEDLINE, EBSCOhost and Cochrane Library. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We included the reports of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence with a sample size of minimum 1000 HCWs. METHODS: The study was registered at the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO, no. CRD42021230456). We used PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement. The keywords were ""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""Coronavirus"", ""seroprevalence"", ""health care workers"" and ""risk factors"". RESULTS: In total 4329 reports were retrieved, duplications were removed; after filtering according to the title and abstract, 25 studies were selected. Risk of bias was assessed in 25 studies; it was low in 13 studies, medium in four studies, and high in eight studies. In meta-analysis using the random effect model, the weighted average of seroprevalence was calculated as 8% (95% CI 6-10%). The pooled seroprevalence rates of the selected variables that have a rate above the average were male HCWs with 9% (95% CI 7-11%); HCWs from ethnic minorities with 13% (95% CI 9-17%); high exposure 9% (95% CI 6-13%); exposure to the virus outside the health care setting 22% (95% CI 14-32%). CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis indicates a SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence rate of 8% among studies that included >1000 HCWs for the year 2020, before vaccinations started.

Bangladesh has confirmed COVID-19 cases and hosts almost 1 million Rohingya refugees from Myanmar, with 600,000 concentrated in the Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site (mean age, 21 years; standard deviation [SD], 18 years; 52% female). Projections of the potential COVID-19 burden, epidemic speed, and healthcare needs in such settings are critical for preparedness planning. METHODS AND FINDINGS: To explore the potential impact of the introduction of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site, we used a stochastic Susceptible Exposed Infectious Recovered (SEIR) transmission model with parameters derived from emerging literature and age as the primary determinant of infection severity. We considered three scenarios with different assumptions about the transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2. From the simulated infections, we estimated hospitalizations, deaths, and healthcare needs expected, age-adjusted for the Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site age distribution. Our findings suggest that a large-scale outbreak is likely after a single introduction of the virus into the camp, with 61%-92% of simulations leading to at least 1,000 people infected across scenarios. On average, in the first 30 days of the outbreak, we expect 18 (95% prediction interval [PI], 2-65), 54 (95% PI, 3-223), and 370 (95% PI, 4-1,850) people infected in the low, moderate, and high transmission scenarios, respectively. These reach 421,500 (95% PI, 376,300-463,500), 546,800 (95% PI, 499,300-567,000), and 589,800 (95% PI, 578,800-595,600) people infected in 12 months, respectively. Hospitalization needs exceeded the existing hospitalization capacity of 340 beds after 55-136 days, between the low and high transmission scenarios. We estimate 2,040 (95% PI, 1,660-2,500), 2,650 (95% PI, 2,030-3,380), and 2,880 (95% PI, 2,090-3,830) deaths in the low, moderate, and high transmission scenarios, respectively. Due to limited data at the time of analyses, we assumed that age was the primary determinant of infection severity and hospitalization. We expect that comorbidities, limited hospitalization, and intensive care capacity may increase this risk; thus, we may be underestimating the potential burden. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that a COVID-19 epidemic in a refugee settlement may have profound consequences, requiring large increases in healthcare capacity and infrastructure that may exceed what is currently feasible in these settings. Detailed and realistic planning for the worst case in Kutupalong-Balukhali and all refugee camps worldwide must begin now. Plans should consider novel and radical strategies to reduce infectious contacts and fill health worker gaps while recognizing that refugees may not have access to national health systems.","Truelove, Shaun; Abrahim, Orit; Altare, Chiara; Lauer, Stephen A; Grantz, Krya H; Azman, Andrew S; Spiegel, Paul",PLoS Med,596,24

Understanding heterogeneity seen in patients with COVIDARDS and comparing to non-COVIDARDS may inform tailored treatments. Objectives: To describe the trajectories of hypoxemia and respiratory compliance in COVIDARDS and associations with outcomes. Methods: A multidisciplinary team of frontline clinicians and data scientists created the Northwell COVIDARDS dataset (NorthCARDS) leveraging over 11,542 COVID-19 hospital admissions. Data was summarized to describe differences based on clinically meaningful categories of lung compliance, and compared to non-COVIDARDS reports. A sophisticated method of extrapolating PaO2 from SpO2, as well estimating FiO2 from non invasive oxygen delivery devices were utilized to create meaningful trends of derived PaO2 to FiO2 (P/F). Measurements and Main Results: Of the 1595 COVIDARDS patients in the NorthCARDS dataset, there were 538 (34.6%) who had very low lung compliance (&lt;20ml/cmH2O), 982 (63.2%) with lownormal compliance (20-50ml/cmH2O), and 34 (2.2%) with high lung compliance (&gt;50ml/cmH2O). The very low compliance group had double the median time to intubation compared to the low-normal group (107 hours(IQR 26.3, 238.3) vs. 37.9 hours(IQR 4.8, 90.7)). Oxygenation trends have improved in all groups after a nadir immediately post intubation. The P/F ratio improved from a mean of 109 to 155, with the very low compliance group showing a smaller improvement compared to low compliance group. The derived P/F trends closely correlated with blood gas analysis driven P/F trends, except immediately post intubation were the trends diverge as illustrated in the image. Overall, 67.5% (n=1049) of the patients died during the hospitalization. In comparison to non-COVIDARDS reports, there were less patients in the high compliance category (2.2%vs.12%, compliance ≥50mL/cmH220), and more patients with P/F ≤ 150 ( 57.8% vs. 45.6%). No correlation was apparent between lung compliance and P/F ratio. The Oxygenation Index was similar, (11.12(SD 5.67)vs.12.8(SD 10.8)). Conclusions: Heterogeneity in lung compliance is seen in COVIDARDS, without apparent correlation to degree of hypoxemia. Notably, time to intubation was greater in the very low lung compliance category. Understanding ARDS patient heterogeneity must include consideration of treatment patterns in addition to trajectories of change in patient-level data and demographics.","Jafari, D.; Gandomi Sereshki, A.; Makhnevich, A.; Qiu, M.; Rolston, D.; Gottesman, E.

For the newly developed vaccines, given that safety beyond the trial population and the worldwide accessibility remains to be determined, there is also an opportunity to explore repurposing the pre-existing safe vaccines like the oral polio vaccine (OPV) leveraging their potential to provide cross-protection. The plausible mechanisms by which OPV might provide partial cross-immunity against SARS-CoV-2 include inhibition of PVR-TIGITCD226 axis and stimulation of trained innate immunity. Inhibition of PVR-TIGIT-CD226 axis by OPV unleashes the immunosuppressive effects of TIGIT, thus priming the immune system against the invading pathogen. Stimulation of trained innate immunity by OPV due to metabolic reprogramming and epigenetic modifications provides partial protection. This paper reviews the literature about live-attenuated OPV as a potential source of protection against COVID-19 and highlights the need for randomized, multicentric trials in India.","Us, V.

However, it is difficult to diagnose and is unique in that it is both a genetic and transmissible disease. The disease is characterised by symptoms of a rapidly progressive dementia.

People with CJD may be cared for in a diversity of settings including; general hospital wards, neurological units, hospices; care homes and in their own home. Management of physical and psychosocial symptoms and dealing with family bereavement is complex and challenging. Due to the complexity of the physical symptoms input from clinicians with palliative care expertise is an important consideration. Given transmission risk and the latent incidence of infection in the general population, following the emergence of variant CJD; plus the recent hypothesis of a potential relationship between immune responses to COVID-19 and the acceleration of preclinical or evident neurodegenerative disease, there is a need for renewed interest in research in this field. Over the past 20 years, many thousands of articles have been published on CJD.

While medical students wanted high-quality, consolidated educational resources on COVID-19, the medical school faculty who typically produced such resources were increasingly burdened with clinical, administrative, and personal commitments. However, students eager to contribute to the pandemic response were well-suited to create these instructional materials for their peers. APPROACH: In mid-March 2020, a group of students at Harvard Medical School came together to synthesize the key facts and collate the best existing educational materials about the COVID-19 pandemic into a unified learning resource. The materials were faculty reviewed and shared freely online. The curriculum now contains 8 modules that are updated regularly. Throughout this process, the student authors prioritized accessibility, iterative improvement, and effective pedagogy. OUTCOMES: To date, nearly 80,000 users from 132 countries have accessed the curriculum. It has been referenced or incorporated into courses at Harvard Medical School and more than 30 other medical schools across the country. About 40% of all users are from outside the United States, and the materials have been translated into 28 languages. This effort has spurred a number of other educational initiatives led by medical student groups in the United States and abroad. NEXT STEPS: As understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic is constantly changing, the student authors' immediate goal is to keep the curriculum up to date in the months to come. They plan to maintain existing partnerships with medical schools and student groups around the world while pursuing new opportunities to expand the curriculum's reach, provide education, and build community. Students and educators alike should leverage student-driven education efforts to benefit other learners both within and importantly beyond their institutions.","Kochis, Michael; Goessling, Wolfram",Acad. med,596,29

Design: Observational cohort study of patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 between March 1, 2020, and April 24, 2020. A propensity-matched (1:1) analysis was used to compare patients who received tocilizumab to controls who did not. Competing risk survival analysis was used to determine the primary outcome of time to mortality, and adjusted log-linear and logistic regression for secondary outcomes. Setting: Three hospitals within the NYU Langone Health system in New York. Patients: Consecutive adult patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019. Intervention: Tocilizumab 400-mg IV once in addition to standard of care or standard of care alone. Measurements and Main Results: Data from 3,580 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positive qualifying hospitalized patients were included, of whom 497 (13.9%) were treated with tocilizumab. In the analysis of tocilizumab-treated patients and matched controls, fewer tocilizumab-treated patients died (145/497, 29.2%) than did controls (211/497, 42.4%). In the adjusted competing risk regression model, tocilizumab therapy was associated with improved survival relative to controls (hazard ratio = 0.24, 95% CI = 0.18-0.33, p < 0.001). Tocilizumab-treated patients and controls had similar adjusted time to discharge from hospital (hazard ratio = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.78-1.17, p = 0.67). However, they had longer adjusted ICU length of stay (rate ratio = 3.1, 95% CI = 2.5-3.7, p < 0.001) and a higher adjusted infection rate (odds ratio = 4.18, 95% CI = 2.72-6.52, p < 0.001) than controls. Conclusions: Tocilizumab therapy was associated with significantly improved survival in coronavirus disease 2019 patients. This survival benefit was associated with increased ICU length of stay and increased infection rate, even as more patients in the tocilizumab group were rescued from rapid death. A prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial is needed to confirm these findings.","Lewis, Tyler C; Adhikari, Samrachana; Tatapudi, Vasishta; Holub, Meredith; Kunichoff, Dennis; Troxel, Andrea B; Montgomery, Robert A; Sterman, Daniel H",Crit Care Explor,596,8

Data are from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and consider the years of 2002, 2007, and 2012. The results show evident ceiling effects with a threshold of 1588 m3/(capita/year) in the multiple predictor model. Above this value, the total renewable water resources per capita no longer have a considerable effect on cereal import dependency. Importantly, we found that if integrated water resource management improves, cereal import dependency will increase for countries with total renewable water resources per capita between 1588 m3/(capita/year) and 5000 m3/(capita/year), but not for countries below or equal to the threshold of 1588 m3/(capita/year). Water-scarce countries above the threshold use cereal imports as a coping strategy to save limited national water resources. This strategy might be suggested to extremely water-scarce countries below the threshold to increase their water use efficiency. Global solidarity of grain exporters with water-scarce countries is required to guarantee their food security, while water-scarce countries need to overcome their skepticism of foreign dominance through food imports.","Bente Castro, Campos Ren Yanjun Jens-Peter Loy",Water,596,22

The discrepancy in COVID-19 incidence and severity is multifaceted and likely involves biological, social, as well as nutritional status. Vitamin D deficiency, notably common in Black and Brown people and elderly, is associated with an increased susceptibility to many of the diseases comorbid with COVID-19. Vitamin D deficiency can cause over-activation of the pulmonary renin-angiotensin system (RAS) leading to the respiratory syndrome. RAS is regulated in part at least by angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which also acts as a primary receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry into the cells. Hence, vitamin D deficiency can exacerbate COVID-19, via its effects on ACE2. In this review we focus on influence of age, gender, and ethnicity on vitamin D-ACE2 interaction and susceptibility to COVID-19.","Getachew, Bruk; Tizabi, Yousef",J Med Virol,596,24

Knowing the intended uptake of the vaccine will inform supply and public health messaging to maximize vaccination. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to measure the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the acceptance of influenza vaccination in the 2020-2021 season, specifically focusing on people who were previously eligible but routinely declined vaccination and newly eligible people. METHODS: Intention to receive the influenza vaccine in 2020-2021 was asked of all registrants of the largest electronic personal health record in the NHS by a web-based questionnaire on July 31, 2020. Of those who were either newly or previously eligible but had not previously received an influenza vaccination, multivariable logistic regression and network diagrams were used to examine their reasons to undergo or decline vaccination. RESULTS: Among 6641 respondents, 945 (14.2%) were previously eligible but were not vaccinated; of these, 536 (56.7%) intended to receive an influenza vaccination in 2020-2021, as did 466 (68.6%) of the newly eligible respondents. Intention to receive the influenza vaccine was associated with increased age, index of multiple deprivation quintile, and considering oneself to be at high risk from COVID-19. Among those who were eligible but not intending to be vaccinated in 2020-2021, 164/543 (30.2%) gave reasons based on misinformation. Of the previously unvaccinated health care workers, 47/96 (49%) stated they would decline vaccination in 2020-2021. CONCLUSIONS: In this sample, COVID-19 has increased acceptance of influenza vaccination in previously eligible but unvaccinated people and has motivated substantial uptake in newly eligible people. This study is essential for informing resource planning and the need for effective messaging campaigns to address negative misconceptions, which is also necessary for COVID-19 vaccination programs.","Bachtiger, Patrik; Adamson, Alexander; Chow, Ji-Jian; Sisodia, Rupa; Quint, Jennifer K; Peters, Nicholas S",JMIR Public Health Surveill,596,29

This paper is a systematic analysis of the dynamics and dimensions of this unprecedented decline. Using transit demand data derived from a widely used transit navigation app, we fit logistic functions to model the decline in daily demand and derive key parameters: base value, the apparent minimal level of demand and cliff and base points, representing the initial date when transit demand decline began and the final date when the decline rate attenuated. Regression analyses reveal that communities with higher proportions of essential workers, vulnerable populations (African American, Hispanic, Female, and people over 45 years old), and more coronavirus Google searches tend to maintain higher levels of minimal demand during COVID-19. Approximately half of the agencies experienced their decline before the local spread of COVID-19 likely began; most of these are in the US Midwest. Almost no transit systems finished their decline periods before local community spread. We also compare hourly demand profiles for each system before and during COVID-19 using ordinary Procrustes distance analysis. The results show substantial departures from typical weekday hourly demand profiles. Our results provide insights into public transit as an essential service during a pandemic.","Liu, Luyu; Miller, Harvey J; Scheff, Jonathan",PLoS One,596,10

The relationships between these variables and the changes in clinical activity, the treated patients' COVID-19 status and the implementation of protective measures in the dental clinic were analyzed. A total of 436 (70.6% women) dentists from 59 countries responded to the survey. Clinical activity was reduced or stopped for 79.1% of respondents. The most common change was to limit treatment to urgent care only (53.7%). Treatment under general anesthesia or deep sedation was discontinued (51.0%) or reduced (35.8%) for the majority of respondents. Male dentists were more likely to maintain their clinical activity than female dentists (p < 0.001), and respondents from North America were more likely to do so than participants from other geographical regions (p < 0.001). Dentists from Latin America and the Caribbean were more likely to report treatment of confirmed cases of COVID-19 than those from Europe (p < 0.001). The implementation of protective measures in the dental office was determined by the survey participant's sex, intensity of clinical activity and geographical area of origin. To conclude, the provision of special care dentistry was considerably reduced in response to the pandemic.

COVID-19 led to a decrease of anthropogenic activities in Turkey, largely due to lockdown. Changes in the air quality index (AQI) were assessed before and during coronavirus. In this study, the authors investigated the changes of AQI for 2.5 µm particulate matter (PM2.5), a primary air pollutant, as well as ozone, a secondary air pollutant, in Turkey during December 2019, April 2020, and May 2020. Overall, the PM2.5 index improved by 34.5% by the end of April 2020. However, the ozone index increased from 16.8 to 28.8 by the end of April. The increase in ozone is attributed to the reduction of PM levels, which increased sunlight penetration. Before COVID-19, the AQI for Turkey was categorized as unhealthy for sensitive groups (PM2.5 = 103); however, during the pandemic, AQI fell to lower boundaries of the moderate category by May 2020 (PM2.5 = 56.9). Changes in municipal wastewater were also assessed. Municipal wastewater quality and hospital waste generation did not change during the pandemic in Turkey. Therefore, we should not expect COVID-19 risks in treatment plant effluents. This study gives confidence to regulators that when strict measures are implemented, air quality can improve.","Aydin, Serdar; Nakiyingi, Betina Assumpta; Esmen, Cengiz; Güneysu, Sinan; Ejjada, Meena",Environ Dev Sustain,596,16

Often the legally authorized representative is not on site. Remote consent procedures in the US are inconsistent with the majority of sites shunning these approaches. The current pandemic with visitor restrictions highlights the need for enhancing these options. METHODS: Remote electronic and phone consent procedures specifically for endovascular stroke trials from two comprehensive stroke centers (CSC) are presented. An overview of the genesis of informed consent procedures in the US is also included. RESULTS: The two CSCs identified as Institution-1 and Institution-2 are large tertiary systems. Institution-1 is a non-profit university-affiliated academic medical center in rural geography. Institution-2 is an HCA hospital in an urban environment. Both serve patients through a spoke-and-hub network, have participated in multiple randomized endovascular stroke trials, and have successfully used these remote options for enrollment. A tiered approach is employed at both institutions with an emphasis on obtaining informed consent in person and resorting to alternatives methods when efforts to that are unsuccessful. A rationale for electronic and phone consent is included, followed by step-by-step illustration of the process at each institution. CONCLUSION: Two examples of remote electronic or phone consent procedures from institutions in different geographic environments and organization structures demonstrate that these options can be successfully used for enrollment in stroke trials.

Compressed sensing results can be used to provably detect a small number of infected persons among a possibly large number of people. There are several advantages of this method compared to classical group testing. Firstly, it is non-adaptive and thus possibly faster to perform than adaptive methods which is crucial in exponentially growing pandemic phases. Secondly, due to nonnegativity of measurements and an appropriate noise model, the compressed sensing problem can be solved with the non-negative least absolute deviation regression (NNLAD) algorithm. This convex tuning-free program requires the same number of tests as current state of the art group testing methods. Empirically it performs significantly better than theoretically guaranteed, and thus the high-throughput, reducing the number of tests to a fraction compared to other methods. Further, numerical evidence suggests that our method can correct sparsely occurring errors.","Petersen, Hendrik Bernd; Bah, Bubacarr; Jung, Peter",,596,20

'Lockdowns' and restrictive measures, especially, have complicated service provision and access, and disrupted key supply chains. Such interventions, alongside more traditional public health measures, interact with baseline health, health system, and social and economic vulnerabilities in LMICs to compound negative impacts. This analysis, based on a rapid evidence assessment by the Social Science in Humanitarian Action Platform in mid-2020, highlights the drivers and evidence of these impacts, emphasises the additional vulnerabilities experienced by marginalised social groups, and provides insight for governments, agencies, organisations and communities to implement more proportionate, appropriate, comprehensive and socially just responses that address COVID-19 in the context of and alongside other disease burdens. In the short term, there is an urgent need to monitor and mitigate impacts of pandemic responses on health service provision, access and use, including through embedding COVID-19 response within integrated health systems approaches. These efforts should also feed into longer-term strategies to strengthen health systems, expand universal healthcare coverage and attend to the social determinants of health-commitments, both existing and new-which governments, donors and international agencies must make and be held accountable to.

Pigs have high contact rates with humans and other animals, transmit similar pathogens as humans including CoVs, and serve as reservoirs and intermediate hosts for notable human pandemics. Wild and domestic pigs both interface with humans and each other but have unique ecologies that demand different surveillance strategies. Three fundamental questions shape any surveillance program: where, when, and how can surveillance be conducted to optimize the surveillance objective? Using theory of mechanisms of zoonotic spillover and data on risk factors, we propose a framework for determining where surveillance might begin initially to maximize a detection in each host species at their interface. We illustrate the utility of the framework using data from the United States. We then discuss variables to consider in refining when and how to conduct surveillance. Recent advances in accounting for opportunistic sampling designs and in translating serology samples into infection times provide promising directions for extracting spatio-temporal estimates of disease risk from typical surveillance data. Such robust estimates of population-level disease risk allow surveillance plans to be updated in space and time based on new information (adaptive surveillance) thus optimizing allocation of surveillance resources to maximize the quality of risk assessment insight.","Pepin, Kim M; Miller, Ryan S; Wilber, Mark Q",Prev Vet Med,596,30

AIMS: To assess the presence of emotional disorders in Spain and the association to sociodemographic characteristics and CERS during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHOD: Cross-sectional survey administered through an online platform. Sociodemographic variables and CERS (CERQ-Short) were collected and possible diagnoses of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD, GAD-7), major depression disorder (MDD; Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]), panic attacks (PA; PHQ-PD), and panic disorders (PD; PHQ-PD) were assessed. Sociodemographic risk factors and CERS association to the possible diagnosis of emotional disorders were reported with hierarchical multivariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: A total of 1,753 respondents completed the questionnaire in Spain. Of these, most (76.8%) were female, with a mean (SD) age of 40.4 years (12.9). A high proportion of participants met diagnostic criteria for emotional disorders: 15.3% for GAD, 12.2% for MDD, 17.2% for PD, and 25.7% had experienced a PA. The contribution of sociodemographic variables to diagnoses of emotional disorders was modest, explaining from 3.1% to 5.7% of the variance; however, when CERS were added, the combination of sociodemographic and CERS explained from 15% to 29% of the variance. Rumination and catastrophizing were the most transdiagnostic maladaptive strategies and positive refocusing was another adaptive strategy. DISCUSSION: Although results from convenience samples should be handled with caution, the high prevalence of emotional disorders in this study suggests that the demand of mental health interventions will probably increase in Spain. Also, CERS play a clear role in the presence of these disorders. CONCLUSION: Intervention programs should focus on training CERS in populations at high risk, focusing on the reduction of maladaptive CERS and the reinforce of other more adaptive CERS.","Muñoz-Navarro, Roger; Cano Vindel, Antonio; Schmitz, Florian; Cabello, Rosario; Fernández-Berrocal, Pablo",Health Educ Behav,596,24

Accumulative evidence suggests SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through the digestive system, the so-called fecal-oral route of transmission, and may induce several gastrointestinal manifestations. MEDLINE® and Embase databases were extensively searched for major clinical manifestations of gastrointestinal involvement in children and adolescents with COVID-19 reported in medical literature, and for nutritional therapy-related data. Findings and recommendations were pragmatically described to facilitate overall pediatric approach. A total of 196 studies addressing gastrointestinal or nutritional aspects associated with the global COVID-19 pandemic were found. Of these, only 17 focused specifically on pediatric patients with regard to aforementioned gastrointestinal or nutritional aspects. Most articles were descriptive and six addressed guidelines, established protocols, or expert opinions. Children and adolescents with gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, should be seriously suspected of COVID-19. Gastrointestinal signs and symptoms may occur in 3% to 79% of children, adolescents and adults with COVID-19, and are more common in severe cases. These include diarrhea (2% to 50%), anorexia (40% to 50%), vomiting (4% to 67%), nausea (1% to 30%), abdominal pain (2% to 6%) and gastrointestinal bleeding (4% to 14%). Patients with inflammatory bowel disease or chronic liver disease are not at greater risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2 relative to the general population. Nutritional support plays an important role in treatment of pediatric patients, particularly those with severe or critical forms of the disease. The digestive system may be a potential route of COVID-19 transmission. Further research is needed to determine whether the fecal-oral route may be involved in viral spread. Nutritional therapy is vital to prevent malnutrition and sarcopenia in severe cases.","Oba, Jane; Carvalho, Werther Brunow de; Silva, Clovis Artur; Delgado, Artur Figueiredo",Einstein (Sao Paulo),596,24

The first three quarter years of 2020 were characterized by an unprecedented reduction of elective inpatient services and a prioritization of intensive care capacity for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. This also resulted in clear consequences for the services provided in cardiac surgery. In addition, during the course of the year the personnel in hospitals were confronted with a plethora of amendments in the legal framework conditions. Nevertheless, the modified German diagnosis-related groups (G-DRG) system 2021 was calculated by the Institute for the Remuneration System in Hospitals (InEK). This article describes and assesses the most important amendments of the modified G­DRG system 2021 for cardiac, thoracic and vascular surgery. Methods: Analysis of the relevant diagnoses, procedures and G­DRG structures in the system versions for 2020 and 2021 based on the information published by the InEK and the German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM). Results: Expansions of the relevant classification systems for diagnoses (ICD-10-GM 2021) and procedures (OPS 2021) lead to an increase in specific coding of essential interventions and operations in cardiovascular surgery. Within the framework of the adaptation of the G­DRG structures, the condensation of the previous fixed rates for heart transplantation to G­DRG A05Z and devaluation of coronary bypass operations and reconstructive vascular interventions are particularly important. Conclusion: For cardiovascular surgery there are manifold amendments with sometimes substantial repercussions for the case proceeds. Additionally, for many German hospitals the effects of the corona pandemic are not yet finally foreseeable. A further increasingly more urgent influencing factor particularly affecting vascular medicine is the increasing pressure to promote outpatient treatment. In this respect, the catalogue for outpatient operations in hospitals (AOP), which is expected in 2022 and will presumably be much expanded, will once again clearly increase the enforcement of outpatient performance of services that were previously performed as inpatient treatment.","Franz, Dominik; Wenke, Andreas; Roeder, Norbert",Z Herz Thorax Gefasschir,596,26

This is an intriguing problem, because the US has historically lacked a standardized set of telehealth coverage and reimbursement policies, which has posed a barrier to telehealth use across all specialties. Although all medical specialties in the US have been affected by these macro (policy-level) barriers, some specialties have been able to integrate telehealth use into mainstream practice, while others are just gaining momentum with telehealth during COVID-19. Although the temporary removal of policy (coverage) restrictions during the pandemic has accelerated telehealth use, uncertainties remain regarding future telehealth sustainability. Since macro (policy-level) factors by themselves do not serve to explain the variation in telehealth use across specialties, it would be important to examine meso (organizational-level) and micro (individual-level) factors historically influencing telehealth use across specialties, to understand underlying reasons for variation and identify implications for widespread sustainability. This paper draws upon the existing literature to develop a conceptual framework on macro-meso-micro factors influencing telehealth use within a medical specialty. The framework is then used to guide a narrative review of the telehealth literature across six medical specialties, including three specialties with lower telehealth use (allergy-immunology, family medicine, gastroenterology) and three with higher telehealth use (psychiatry, cardiology, radiology) in the US, in order to synthesize themes and gain insights into barriers and facilitators to telehealth use. In doing so, this review addresses a gap in the literature and provides a foundation for future research. Importantly, it helps to identify implications for ensuring widespread sustainability of telehealth use in the post-pandemic future.","Rangachari, Pavani; Mushiana, Swapandeep S; Herbert, Krista",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),596,6

We exposed differentiated air-liquid interface cultures derived from primary human airway stem cells to cigarette smoke extract (CSE) and infected them with SARS-CoV-2. We found that CSE increased expression of full-length ACE2 (flACE2) but did not alter the expression of a Type I-interferon sensitive truncated ACE2 that lacks the capacity to bind SARS-CoV-2 or a panel of interferon-sensitive genes. Importantly, exposure to CSE did not increase viral infectivity despite the increase in flACE2.

The Zambian urban adherence club (AC) is a health service innovation designed to improve on-time drug pickup and retention in HIV care through off-hours facility access and pharmacist-led group drug distribution. Similar models of differentiated service delivery (DSD) have shown promise in South Africa, but observational analyses of these models are prone to bias and confounding. We sought to evaluate the effectiveness and implementation of ACs in Zambia using a more rigorous study design. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using a matched-pair cluster randomized study design (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02776254), 10 clinics were randomized to intervention (5 clinics) or control (5 clinics). At each clinic, between May 19 and October 27, 2016, a systematic random sample was assessed for eligibility (HIV+, age &#8805; 14 years, on ART >6 months, not acutely ill, CD4 count not <200 cells/mm3) and willingness to participate in an AC. Clinical and antiretroviral drug pickup data were obtained through the existing electronic medical record. AC meeting attendance data were collected at intervention facilities prospectively through October 28, 2017. The primary outcome was time to first late drug pickup (>7 days late). Intervention effect was estimated using unadjusted Kaplan-Meier survival curves and a Cox proportional hazards model to derive an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR). Medication possession ratio (MPR) and implementation outcomes (adoption, acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, and fidelity) were additionally evaluated as secondary outcomes. Baseline characteristics were similar between 571 intervention and 489 control participants with respect to median age (42 versus 41 years), sex (62% versus 66% female), median time since ART initiation (4.8 versus 5.0 years), median CD4 count at study enrollment (506 versus 533 cells/mm3), and baseline retention (53% versus 55% with at least 1 late drug pickup in previous 12 months). The rate of late drug pickup was lower in intervention participants compared to control participants (aHR 0.26, 95% CI 0.15-0.45, p < 0.001). Median MPR was 100% in intervention participants compared to 96% in control participants (p < 0.001). Although 18% (683/3,734) of AC group meeting visits were missed, on-time drug pickup (within 7 days) still occurred in 51% (350/683) of these missed visits through alternate means (use of buddy pickup or early return to the facility). Qualitative evaluation suggests that the intervention was acceptable to both patients and providers. While patients embraced the convenience and patient-centeredness of the model, preference for traditional adherence counseling and need for greater human resources influenced intervention appropriateness and feasibility from the provider perspective. The main limitations of this study were the small number of clusters, lack of viral load data, and relatively short follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: ACs were found to be an effective model of service delivery for reducing late ART drug pickup among HIV-infected adults in Zambia. Drug pickup outside of group meetings was relatively common and underscores the need for DSD models to be flexible and patient-centered if they are to be effective.

Study design: Interviews using the validated American Academy of Pediatrics 2-question food insecurity screen were performed with 200 consecutive families presenting for pediatric care to 2 FQHC in Central Texas from April 14 to May 20, 2020, during the initial phase of the pandemic in Texas. Brief qualitative interviews were conducted to determine whether families found a worsening of food insecurity during the pandemic. Results: Overall, 47% of families had a positive food insecurity screen. More than 90% of these were worrying about food running out and about 60% were positive for the question related to food not lasting. Among families with food insecurity, 94% indicated this had begun or worsened during the pandemic. Of the 115 families volunteering information about employment, 46% reported job loss during this time period. Both ethnicity (P &lt; .001) and Special Supplementation Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) participation (P = .03) were associated with greater levels of food insecurity. Among primarily Spanish-speaking families participating in the WIC program, 64% reported food insecurity. Conclusions: Approximately one-half of families receiving routine pediatric care at a FQHC during the coronavirus disease-19 pandemic reported food insecurity and this was associated with loss of jobs during the pandemic. Participation in the WIC program was not protective against food insecurity. Increased frequency of food insecurity was detected in Hispanic and Spanish-speaking families. Screening of families at an FQHC should be strongly considered as a part of routine pediatric care. Knowledge of community resources is important for providers to share with patients.

This study examined the media accounts during that period by analysing the representation of death-related constructs in Corriere della Sera, the most widely read newspaper in Italy. A textual and thematic analysis of articles published between period A (epidemic: 23 January-22 February 2020) and period B (pandemic: 23 February-31 March 2020) was conducted using Nvivo-11. A total of 141 articles comprising 48,524 words were collected. The most utilised words and meanings linked to COVID-19 were computed. In the rank distribution, 'China' and 'virus' were the terms most frequently used in both periods. The terms 'death' and 'dead' were completely absent in period A and appeared in the 535th position in period B. The term 'dead' was used primarily to indicate the number of deceased. From a Terror Management Theory perspective, it is possible that the minimal reference to death-related issues was a reflection of death denial and a manifestation of efforts to deny death to manage terror. These findings highlight the ambiguities and ambivalence surrounding any issue pertaining to death; on the one side, undue alarmism may provoke exaggerated reactions, such as moral panic, while on the other denial-based messages that minimise references to mortality may reduce safe behaviour during a pandemic.","Solomon, Sheldon; Rostellato, Daniele; Testoni, Ines; Calabrese, Fiorella; Biasco, Guido",,596,23

Medical practitioners working in hospitals at the epicenters of COVID-19 pandemic have emphasized on the need to manage mildly ill and convalescent COVID-19 patients at home or community facilities rather than at hospitals during a pandemic. In this article, we highlight that a standardized home- and community-based (HCBC) approach for management of COVID-19 patients will be a key component for preparing hospitals in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) for a potential surge in COVID-19 cases. So far, based on the trajectory of infection, we think that SSA seems to have a window of opportunity, albeit narrowing, for implementing HCBC. However, there are challenges that will need to be addressed in order to implement and maintain HCBC. Successful implementation and maintenance of HCBC in SSA will require international agencies and key donors to work closely with the national governments; providing them with policy, technical, and financial assistance. Home- and community-based care (HCBC) is also important because it can play a role in advocacy, education, training, and health promotion during COVID-19 pandemic. We further underscore the need for a delicate balance between HCBC and hospital-based care (HBC) approach as well as with COVID-19 mitigation and suppression measures in order to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 community transmission and allow optimal continuity of the HBC. We conclude by emphasizing once again that, for countries in SSA to adequately prepare for the worst-case scenario of COVID-19 pandemic in the absence of a cure, policy makers of member states need to act collectively and fast.","Onywera, Harris; Mwapagha, Lamech Malagho; Hsiao, Nei-Yuan",Pan Afr Med J,596,1

A newly-developed ELISA assay for IgM and IgG antibodies against N protein of SARS-CoV-2 was used to screen the serums of 238 admitted hospital patients between February 6 and February 14, 2020 with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected on pharyngeal swab specimens using real time RT-PCR. 194 (81.5%) of the serums were detected to be antibody (IgM and/or IgG) positive, significantly higher than the positive rate of viral RNA (64.3%). There was no difference in the positive rate of antibodies between the confirmed patients (83.0%, 127/153) and the suspected patients (78.8%, 67/85), whose nucleic acid tests were negative. The antibody positive rates were very low in the first five days after initial onset of symptoms, and then rapidly increased as the disease progressed. After 10 days, the antibody positive rates jumped from below 50% to over 80%. However, the positive rates of viral RNA maintained above 60% in the first 11 days after initial onset of symptoms, and then rapidly decreased. Overall, the suspected patients were most likely infected by SARS-CoV-2. Before the 11th day after initial onset of symptoms, nucleic acid test is key for confirmation of viral infection. The combination of serological assay can greatly improve the diagnostic efficacy. After the 11th day post-disease onset, the diagnosis for viral infection should be majorly dependent on serological assay.","Liu, Lei; Liu, Wanbing; Zheng, Yaqiong; Jiang, Xiaojing; Kou, Guomei; Ding, Jinya; Wang, Qiongshu; Huang, Qianchuan; Ding, Yinjuan; Ni, Wenxu; Wu, Wanlei; Tang, Shi; Tan, Li; Hu, Zhenhong; Xu, Weitian; Zhang, Yong; Zhang, Bo; Tang, Zhongzhi; Zhang, Xinhua; Li, Honghua; Rao, Zhiguo; Jiang, Hui; Ren, Xingfeng; Wang, Shengdian; Zheng, Shangen",Microbes Infect,596,16

METHODS: We included a total of 343 consecutive hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in this study. The chest x-rays of these patients were scored retrospectively by three radiologists independently. We divided CXR in to six zones (right upper, mid & lower and left, upper mid & lower zones). We scored each zone as- 0, 1 or 2 as follows- if that zone was clear (0) Ground glass opacity (1) or Consolidation (2). A total of score from 0 to 12 could be obtained. RESULTS: A CXR score cut off &#8805;3 independently predicted mortality. Along with a relatively higher NPV &#8805;80%, it reinforced the importance of CXR score is a screening tool to triage patients according to risk of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that Pennine score is a simple tool which can be adapted by various countries, experiencing a large surge in number of patients, to decide which patient would need a tertiary Hospital referral/admission as opposed to patients that can be managed locally or at basic/primary care hospitals.","Singh, Aparajita; Lim, Yoke Hong; Annamalaisamy, Rajesh; Koteyar, Shyam Sunder; Chandran, Suresh; Kanodia, Avinash Kumar; Khanna, Navin",Scott Med J,596,1

To improve the model's ability to recognize minority class (the infected patients), we introduce data augmentation and cost-sensitive methods into our model. Besides, considering the particularity of this task, we deploy some fine-tuning techniques to adjust the pre-training ResNet50. Furthermore, to improve the model's generalizability, we use ensemble learning to integrate prediction results from multiple base classifiers generated using different random seeds. To evaluate the proposed DiCOVA-Net's performance, we conducted experiments with the DiCOVA challenge dataset.

The model is designed to simulate the spatiotemporal spread of SARS-CoV2 disease, known as COVID-19. Our SARS-CoV2-based ABM framework (CoV-ABM) simulates the spread at any geographical scale, ranging from a village to a country and considers unique characteristics of SARS-CoV2 viruses such as its persistence in the environment. Therefore, unlike other simulators, CoV-ABM computes the density of active viruses inside each location space to get the virus transmission probability for each agent. It also uses the local census and health data to create health and risk factor profiles for each individual. The proposed model relies on a flexible timestamp scale to optimize the computational speed and the level of detail. In our framework each agent represents a person interacting with the surrounding space and other adjacent agents inside the same space. Moreover, families stochastic daily tasks are formulated to get tracked by the corresponding family members. The model also formulates the possibility of meetings for each subset of friendships and relatives. The main aim of the proposed framework is threefold: to illustrate the dynamics of SARS-CoV diseases, to identify places which have a higher probability to become infection hubs and to provide a decision-support system to design efficient interventions in order to fight against pandemics. The framework employs SEIHRD dynamics of viral diseases with different intervention scenarios. The paper simulates the spread of COVID-19 in the State of Delaware, United States, with near one million stochastic agents. The results achieved over a period of 15 weeks with a timestamp of 1 hour show which places become the hubs of infection. The paper also illustrates how hospitals get overwhelmed as the outbreak reaches its pick.","Jalayer, Masoud; Orsenigo, Carlotta; Vercellis, Carlo",,596,1

HYPOTHESIS: The possible risk factors that lead to death in critical inpatients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are not yet fully understood. METHODS: In this single-center, retrospective study, we enrolled 113 critical patients with COVID-19 from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University between February 1, 2020 and March 15, 2020. Patients who survived or died were compared. RESULTS: A total of 113 critical patients with COVID-19 were recruited; 50 (44.3%) died, and 63 (55.7%) recovered. The proportion of patients with ventricular arrhythmia was higher in the death group than in the recovery group (P = .021) and was higher among patients with myocardial damage than patients without myocardial damage (P = .013). Multivariate analysis confirmed independent predictors of mortality from COVID-19: age > 70 years (HR 1.84, 95% CI 1.03-3.28), initial neutrophil count over 6.5 × 109 /L (HR 3.43, 95% CI 1.84-6.40), C-reactive protein greater than 100 mg/L (HR 1.93, 95% CI 1.04-3.59), and lactate dehydrogenase over 300 U/L (HR 2.90, 95% CI 1.26-6.67).

It is unknown how many US states have ventilator allocation guidelines and how these state guidelines compare with one another. Objective: To evaluate the number of publicly available US state guidelines for ventilator allocation and the variation in state recommendations for how ventilator allocation decisions should occur and to assess whether unique criteria exist for pediatric patients. Evidence Review: This systematic review evaluated publicly available guidelines about ventilator allocation for all states in the US and in the District of Columbia using department of health websites for each state and internet searches. Documents with any discussion of a process to triage mechanical ventilatory support during a public health emergency were screened for inclusion. Articles were excluded if they did not include specific ventilator allocation recommendations, were in draft status, did not include their state department of health, or were not the most up-to-date guideline. All documents were individually assessed and reassessed by 2 independent reviewers from March 30 to April 2 and May 8 to 10, 2020. Findings: As of May 10, 2020, 26 states had publicly available ventilator guidelines, and 14 states had pediatric guidelines. Use of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score in the initial rank of adult patients was recommended in 15 state guidelines (58%), and assessment of limited life expectancy from underlying conditions or comorbidities was included in 6 state guidelines (23%). Priority was recommended for specific groups in the initial evaluation of patients in 6 states (23%) (ie, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Utah). Many states recommended exclusion criteria in adult (11 of 26 states [42%]) and pediatric (10 of 14 states [71%]) ventilator allocation. Withdrawal of mechanical ventilation from a patient to give to another if a shortage occurs was discussed in 22 of 26 adult guidelines (85%) and 9 of 14 pediatric guidelines (64%). Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that although allocation guidelines for mechanical ventilatory support are essential in a public health emergency, only 26 US states provided public guidance on how this allocation should occur. Guidelines among states, including adjacent states, varied significantly and could cause inequity in the allocation of mechanical ventilatory support during a public health emergency, such as the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.","Piscitello, Gina M; Kapania, Esha M; Miller, William D; Rojas, Juan C; Siegler, Mark; Parker, William F",JAMA Netw Open,596,1

Despite global efforts to prevent and treat virus infections to limit morbidity and mortality, the continued emergence and re-emergence of new outbreaks as well as common infections such as influenza persist as a health threat. Challenges to the prevention of severe disease after virus infection include both a paucity of protective vaccines as well as the early identification of individuals with the highest risk that may require supportive treatment. Methods: We completed a screen of mice from the Collaborative Cross (CC) that we infected with influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus, and West Nile virus. Results: The CC mice exhibited a range of disease manifestations upon infections, and we used this natural variation to identify strains with mortality after infection and strains exhibiting no mortality. We then used comprehensive preinfection immunophenotyping to identify global baseline immune correlates of protection from mortality to virus infection.

Detection platforms that are efficient, rapid, accurate, specific, sensitive, and user friendly are urgently needed to manage and control the spread of SARS-CoV-2. RT-qPCR based methods are the gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 detection. However, these methods require trained personnel, sophisticated infrastructure, and a long turnaround time, thereby limiting their usefulness. Reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), a one-step nucleic acid amplification method conducted at a single temperature, has been used for colorimetric virus detection. CRISPR-Cas12 and CRISPR-Cas13 systems, which possess collateral activity against ssDNA and RNA, respectively, have also been harnessed for virus detection. Here, we built an efficient, rapid, specific, sensitive, user-friendly SARS-CoV-2 detection module that combines the robust virus amplification of RT-LAMP with the specific detection ability of SARS-CoV-2 by CRISPR-Cas12. Furthermore, we combined the RT-LAMP-CRISPR-Cas12 module with lateral flow cells to enable highly efficient point-of-care SARS-CoV-2 detection. Our iSCAN SARS-CoV-2 detection module, which exhibits the critical features of a robust molecular diagnostic device, should facilitate the effective management and control of COVID-19.","Ali, Zahir; Aman, Rashid; Mahas, Ahmed; Rao, Gundra Sivakrishna; Tehseen, Muhammad; Marsic, Tin; Salunke, Rahul; Subudhi, Amit K; Hala, Sharif M; Hamdan, Samir M; Pain, Arnab; Alofi, Fadwa S; Alsomali, Afrah; Hashem, Anwar M; Khogeer, Asim; Almontashiri, Naif A M; Abedalthagafi, Malak; Hassan, Norhan; Mahfouz, Magdy M",Virus Res,596,16

This study aimed to explore the behavioral changes and personal hygiene practices in relation with background psychosocial and health characteristics of older adults during the COVID-19 emergency. METHODS: A cross-sectional telephonic survey was conducted with the participants of the Kawasaki Aging and Wellbeing Project (KAWP), an on-going longitudinal cohort study of older adults aged 85 or older. The interviews were conducted using a structured questionnaire consisting of 11 closed questions regarding behavioral changes and personal hygiene practices during the state of emergency. Sociodemographic and health data were obtained from the KAWP baseline survey conducted 2.2 years before the telephonic survey. RESULTS: Overall, 487 participants from the KAWP responded to the telephonic survey (response rate: 89.2%). 94.5% of the respondents reported no changes in basic lifestyle habits, such as eating, sleeping, smoking, and drinking, whereas 28.1% reported a decrease in physical activity, and 54.6% reported going out less frequently. One-third of the respondents reported a decrease in the number of people to converse with, as well as the amount of time to converse. For personal hygiene practices, 93.8% reported wearing a mask when they went out, and 50.3% reported an increased frequency of handwashing. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that engagement in physical activity at baseline (odds ratio [OR] = 1.95, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.23-3.08), smartphone ownership (OR = 2.15, 95% CI = 1.33-3.47), and visual impairment (OR = 1.79; 95% CI = 1.10-2.91) were independently associated with decreased physical activity during the COVID-19 emergency. Female respondents and smartphone ownership were significantly associated with more frequent handwashing. CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed that older adults in an urban setting responded to the COVID-19 emergency with behavioral changes. The findings of this study have implications for the design of preventive strategies to maintain the health and wellbeing of at-risk older adults.","Arai, Yasumichi; Oguma, Yuko; Abe, Yukiko; Takayama, Midori; Hara, Azusa; Urushihara, Hisashi; Takebayashi, Toru",BMC Geriatr,596,29

Their protein composition and gluten dependent technological traits have been comprehensively studied, however, little information is available about their carbohydrate dependent viscous properties. The aim of this work was the comprehensive rheological characterisation of all sublines of Bánkúti 1201 maintained at Martonvásár and to investigate their variability if the carbohydrate dependent viscous behaviour would be also included in the analyses. RESULTS: The majority of the lines reflected the famously good mixing quality of Bánkúti, however, much higher diversity of pasting behaviour was detected. Cluster analysis of the Mixolab data was performed resulting four sample groups. Since several lines of similar mixing properties had significantly different pasting characteristics, it was assumed that classification was mainly based on the viscous properties. From each clusters 2-3 representative samples were selected for wider examination using conventional testing methods. These results also supported the higher variability of pasting behaviour of the lines, which can be critical for end product quality. The members of the second cluster can be highlighted due to their waxy wheat like behaviour. CONCLUSIONS: Possible reasons of the great variability of pasting behaviour could be the compositional and structural differences of starch and other carbohydrates (e.g. arabinoxylans). Complex rheological characterisation and study of molecular background can provide information about important traits in the point of view of technology and product development, which are unknown in the case of old wheat varieties and landraces.

Knowledge about the radiological findings of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in children is limited. Hence, we systematically synthesized the available data that will help in better management of COVID-19 in children. METHODS: Four different electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science and CENTRAL) were searched for articles reporting radiological findings in children with COVID-19. Studies reporting thoracic radiological findings of COVID-19 in patients aged <19 years were included. A random-effect meta-analysis (wherever feasible) was performed to provide pooled estimates of various findings. RESULTS: A total of 1984 records were screened of which forty-six studies (923 patients) fulfilled the eligibility criteria and were included in this systematic review. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan was the most frequently used imaging modality. While one-third of the patients had normal scans, a significant proportion (19%) of clinically asymptomatic children had radiological abnormalities too. Unilateral lung involvement (55%) was frequent when compared with bilateral and ground-glass opacities were the most frequent (40%) definitive radiological findings. Other common radiological findings were non-specific patchy shadows (44%), consolidation (23%), halo sign (26%), pulmonary nodules and prominent bronchovascular marking. Interstitial infiltration being the most frequent lung ultrasound finding. CONCLUSION: CT scan is the most frequently used imaging modality for COVID-19 in children and can detect pneumonia before the appearance of clinical symptoms. Undefined patchy shadows, grand-glass opacities and consolidation are commonly observed imaging findings in COVID-19 pneumonia.","Kumar, Jogender; Meena, Jitendra; Yadav, Arushi; Yadav, Jaivinder",J. trop. pedriatr,596,16

Nevertheless, concerns about asthma and allergy are still high.. In order to evaluate the impact of paediatric COVID-19 among Italian paediatricians, we sent a 20-questions anonymous internet-based survey to 250 Italian paediatricians with particular address to allergic symptoms and those affecting the upper airways. METHODS: The questionnaire was conceived and pretested in April 2020, by a working group of experts of the Italian Paediatric Society for Allergy and Immunology (SIAIP), and structured into different sections of 20 categorized and multiple choice questions. The first part included questions about epidemiological data follows by a second part assessing the way to manage a suspected COVID-19 infection and personal experiences about that. The third part concerned questions about patients' clinical characteristics and clinical manifestations. The survey was emailed once between April and mid-May 2020. RESULTS: A total 99 participants had participated in our survey and provided responses to our electronic questionnaire. The distribution of patients reported per month varies significantly according to the geographical area (P = 0.02). Data confirmed that in the North part of Italy the rate of patients referred is higher than in the rest of Italy. Almost all respondents (98%) reported caring for up to a maximum of 10 infected children and the last 2% more than twenty. Among these patients, according to the 75% of responders, a maximum rate of 20% were affected by allergic rhino-conjunctivitis and in particular in the North of Italy while in the Centre and in the South there was a higher incidence (P = 0.09). Almost the same applies for asthma, 83% of responders declared that up to a maximum of 20% of affected children were asthmatic, from 20 to 40% for the 13,5% of responders and from 40 to 60% for the last 3,5%. As for the allergic conjunctivitis also for asthma, we found a higher incidence in the Centre and in South than in the North (P = 0.03).

This study was conducted to guide the Qatari national response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic. The study investigated the epidemic's time-course, forecasted health care needs, predicted the impact of social and physical distancing restrictions, and rationalized and justified easing of restrictions. Methods: An age-structured deterministic model was constructed to describe SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics and disease progression throughout the population. Results: The enforced social and physical distancing interventions flattened the epidemic curve, reducing the peaks for incidence, prevalence, acute-care hospitalization, and intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalizations by 87%, 86%, 76%, and 78%, respectively. The daily number of new infections was predicted to peak at 12 750 on May 23, and active-infection prevalence was predicted to peak at 3.2% on May 25. Daily acute-care and ICU-care hospital admissions and occupancy were forecast accurately and precisely. By October 15, 2020, the basic reproduction number R0 had varied between 1.07-2.78, and 50.8% of the population were estimated to have been infected (1.43 million infections). The proportion of actual infections diagnosed was estimated at 11.6%. Applying the concept of Rt tuning, gradual easing of restrictions was rationalized and justified to start on June 15, 2020, when Rt declined to 0.7, to buffer the increased interpersonal contact with easing of restrictions and to minimize the risk of a second wave. No second wave has materialized as of October 15, 2020, five months after the epidemic peak. Conclusions: Use of modeling and forecasting to guide the national response proved to be a successful strategy, reducing the toll of the epidemic to a manageable level for the health care system.","Ayoub, Houssein H; Chemaitelly, Hiam; Seedat, Shaheen; Makhoul, Monia; Al Kanaani, Zaina; Al Khal, Abdullatif; Al Kuwari, Einas; Butt, Adeel A; Coyle, Peter; Jeremijenko, Andrew; Kaleeckal, Anvar Hassan; Latif, Ali Nizar; Shaik, Riyazuddin Mohammad; Rahim, Hanan Abdul; Yassine, Hadi M; Al Kuwari, Mohamed G; Al Romaihi, Hamad Eid; Al-Thani, Mohamed H; Bertollini, Roberto; Abu Raddad, Laith J",J Glob Health,596,12

A previous drug repurposing screen identified the approved anthelminthic drug niclosamide as a small molecule inhibitor of Zika virus infection. However, as antihelminthic drugs are generally designed to have low absorption when dosed orally, the very limited bioavailability of niclosamide will likely hinder its potential direct repurposing as an antiviral medication. Here, we conducted SAR studies focusing on the anilide and salicylic acid regions of niclosamide to improve physicochemical properties such as microsomal metabolic stability, permeability and solubility. We found that the 5-bromo substitution in the salicylic acid region retains potency while providing better drug-like properties. Other modifications in the anilide region with 2'-OMe and 2'-H substitutions were also advantageous. We found that the 4'-NO2 substituent can be replaced with a 4'-CN or 4'-CF3 substituents. Together, these modifications provide a basis for optimizing the structure of niclosamide to improve systemic exposure for application of niclosamide analogs as drug lead candidates for treating Zika and other viral infections. Indeed, key analogs were also able to rescue cells from the cytopathic effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection, indicating relevance for therapeutic strategies targeting the COVID-19 pandemic.","Shamim, Khalida; Xu, Miao; Hu, Xin; Lee, Emily M; Lu, Xiao; Huang, Ruili; Shah, Pranav; Xu, Xin; Chen, Catherine Z; Shen, Min; Guo, Hui; Chen, Lu; Itkin, Zina; Eastman, Richard T; Shinn, Paul; Klumpp-Thomas, Carleen; Michael, Sam; Simeonov, Anton; Lo, Donald C; Ming, Guo-Li; Song, Hongjun; Tang, Hengli; Zheng, Wei; Huang, Wenwei",Bioorg Med Chem Lett,596,16

CASE REPORT A 48-year-old man was diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD) in 3 vessels (3VD) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 61% and chronic kidney disease (CKD) with routine hemodialysis. The patient was scheduled for a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. He underwent surgery after COVID-19 screening using a checklist provided by the hospital. The patient's condition worsened on the 3rd postoperative day in the ward, and he was transferred back to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), reintubated, and tested for COVID-19 with a real time-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, we excluded the other possible pneumonia causes (e.g., influenza). An RT-PCR test performed after surgery revealed that the patient was positive for COVID-19.

A highly significant reduction in the visits at ECD of the hospital during March and April 2020 was observed as compared with January and February of the same year (p for linear trend < ·001); in particular the number of visits was 41.1% lower in March 2020 and 32.7% lower in April 2020, as compared to January 2020. As the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases throughout the country increased (i.e., from February 26th to April 2nd) the number of visits at ECD decreased (p = 0.01), whereas, the opposite was observed in the period afterwards (p = 0.01).The number of acute Myocardial infarctions (MI) cases in March 2020 was the lowest compared to the entire three year period (p < 0·001); however, the number of acute MI cases in April 2020 was doubled as compared to March 2020, but still was lower than the preceding years (p < 0·001). CONCLUSIONS: It is hard to explain the mystery of the ""missing"" emergency hospital visits. However, if this decline in cardiovascular disease related hospital visits is ""true"", it is something that needs to be rigorously studied, to learn how to keep these rates down.","Tsioufis, Konstantinos; Chrysohoou, Christina; Kariori, Maria; Leontsinis, Ioannis; Dalakouras, Ioannis; Papanikolaou, Angelos; Charalambus, Georgios; Sambatakou, Helen; Siasos, Gerasimos; Panagiotakos, Demosthenes; Tousoulis, Dimitrios",Clin Res Cardiol,596,22

Each well-recorded case in homeopathic practice is important for deciding the future course of action. This study aims at identifying clinically useful homeopathic remedies and their prescribing symptoms using the prognostic factor research model. METHODS: This was an open-label, multi-centric, observational study performed from April 2020 to July 2020 at various public health care clinics. The data were collected prospectively from clinical practice at integrated COVID-19 care facilities in India. Good-quality cases were selected using a specific set of criteria. These cases were analyzed for elucidating prognostic factors by calculating the likelihood ratio (LR) of each frequently occurring symptom. The symptoms with high LR values (>1) were considered as prescribing indications of the specific remedy. RESULTS: Out of 327 COVID-19 cases reported, 211 met the selection criteria for analysis. The most common complaints were fatigue, sore throat, dry cough, myalgia, fever, dry mouth and throat, increased thirst, headache, decreased appetite, anxiety, and altered taste. Twenty-seven remedies were prescribed and four of them-Arsenicum album, Bryonia alba, Gelsemium sempervirens, and Pulsatilla nigricans-were the most frequently used. A high LR was obtained for certain symptoms, which enabled differentiation between the remedies for a given patient. CONCLUSION: Homeopathic medicines were associated with improvement in symptoms of COVID-19 cases. Characteristic symptoms of four frequently indicated remedies have been identified using prognostic factor research, findings that can contribute to accurate homeopathic prescribing during future controlled research in COVID-19.","Manchanda, Raj Kumar; Miglani, Anjali; Gupta, Meeta; Meena, Baljeet Singh; Chadha, Vishal; Joseph, Franco; Kalsi, Amrit; Konthembath, Pramod; Sharma, Kavita; Rama, Kamsali Nadigadda; Kaur, Prabhjeet; Thavarayil Kannoth, Jithesh; Nagrath, Cheshta; Jethani, Anju; Nellikka Aniyeri, Shajimol; Chawla, Anu; Ray, Malaya Kumar; Ghuliani, Manjula; Kudiyarasu, Ram Kumar; Naskar, Shruti; Bala, Sudha; Sharma, Brender",Homeopathy,596,24

Therefore, we compared the ITA indications for RRA with the recommendations by the 2015 American Thyroid Association guidelines (ATA). METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 380 consecutive DTC patients treated with surgery and RRA, followed at the Section of Endocrinology, University of Siena, Italy from January 2006 to December 2019. RESULTS: Using ITA a significant increase of DTC patients classified as low or high risk and a significant decrease of patients defined at intermediate risk were observed (p < 0.0001). Consequently, the percentage of patients without routinary indication for RRA (47.4%, versus 38.2%, p < 0.0001) and those with a definite indication for RRA (8.2 versus 1.8%, p < 0.0001) was significantly higher compared to ATA. Moreover, using ITA the percentage of patients with a selective use of RRA was lower in comparison to ATA (44.7% versus 60%, p < 0.0001). Nevertheless, the prevalence of distant metastases, at post-ablative whole body scan, in patients without indication for RRA, was not different using either ATA or ITA (2.1% and 1.1% respectively, p = 0.37). CONCLUSION: The use of ITA Consensus, in clinical practice, increases significantly the number of patients for whom RRA is not routinely indicated in comparison to ATA guidelines but without differences in delaying the diagnosis of distant metastatic disease.","Forleo, R; Fralassi, N; Maino, F; Capezzone, M; Brilli, L; Pilli, T; Cantara, S; Castagna, M G",J. endocrinol. invest,596,16

A two-step method was implemented to systematically control the quality of raw sensor data and calibrate the sensor data against co-located reference instruments. During the lockdown period, 17-24% higher indoor PM2.5 concentrations were observed in comparison to those in the 2019 business-as-usual period. In residential sites, a clear peak in PM2.5 concentrations in the afternoon and elevated evening levels toping at roughly 10 µg·m-3 was observed, which reflects enhanced human activity during lunch and dinner time (i.e., cooking) and possibly more cleaning and indoor movement that increase particle generation and resuspension in homes.

RESULTS: Ten focus groups were conducted with 56 parents (Mage = 34 years; 80% female; 89% White). Results were constructed around three domains: decision-making approaches; values and beliefs; and decision-making challenges. Parents discussed varying approaches to making the decision, ranging from relying on their ""gut feeling"" to desiring statistics and probabilities. Religious and spiritual beliefs often guided the decision to not terminate the pregnancy. Quality of life was an important consideration, including how each option would impact the child (e.g., pain or discomfort, cognitive and physical abilities) and their family (e.g., care for other children, marriage, and career). Parents reported inconsistent communication of options by clinicians and challenges related to time constraints for making a decision and difficulty in processing information when distressed.

Variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 have attracted significant attention owing to their widespread transmission and possible immune evasion. A total of 19 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines based on original strains have entered clinical studies, including nine vaccines that have obtained emergency use or conditional marketing authorizations. However, newly emerging variants may affect their protective efficacy. Decreased efficacy of the Novartis, Johnson & Johnson, and AstraZeneca vaccines against B.1.351 has been reported. The spread of variants creates a tremendous challenge for the prevention and control of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic via vaccination. Several response strategies, including accelerating massive rollouts of current vaccines, increasing vaccine immunogenicity by increasing vaccination doses, and accelerating next-generation vaccines against variants, have been suggested. AREAS COVERED: SARS-CoV-2 vaccine efficacy against variants and response strategies for emerging variants. EXPERT OPINION: Current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines authorized for emergency use or under clinical trials have shown certain advantages in providing adequate protection against new variants. We analyzed the effects of reported variants on neutralizing antibodies and the protective efficacy of different vaccines and propose strategies for applying current vaccines against variants and developing next-generation vaccines.","Bian, Lianlian; Gao, Fan; Zhang, Jialu; He, Qian; Mao, Qunying; Xu, Miao; Liang, Zhenglun",Expert Rev Vaccines,596,1

Design/Methodology/Approach: The method of decision analysis makes it possible to identify the causes and effects of decisions made by governments and the management of shipbuilding groups. The comparative method is used to compare the changes taking place in the European and Asian shipbuilding industries. The statistical method is used to illustrate the dynamics of the economic and financial situations of shipyards. Findings: Shipyards operate on a competitive world market which experiences cyclical fluctuations in demand for ships. The dominant position of East Asian shipyards in the world market in the 21st century is the result of state subsidies, low labor costs, and the establishment of shipbuilding groups. In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, shipowners reduced orders for ships in the wake of a decline in demand for sea transport. The pandemic crisis hit shipyards in Europe specializing in the construction of cruise ships hardest. Practical implications: The European Union should adopt solutions that will allow European shipyards to maintain their leading position in constructing complex, technologically advanced ships.

Methods: An online survey comprising of 34 questions in nine sections was conducted using Google Forms. The link for the questionnaire was shared via e-mail and social media to practicing physicians. The survey accepted responses from September 10, 2020, to September 30, 2020. Results: In total, 509 ophthalmologists and 91 physicians from other specialties participated in the survey. The physicians were predominantly employed in nongovernmental institutes (25%) or were in private practice (33.2%). The preference was to attend a weekend webinar (62.8%), in the evening (52.8%), not extending more than 2 hours (97.7%), by &#8804;3 reputed national speakers (89.8%), each given 15 to 30 minutes for their presentation, and the topic being clinical or surgical skill demonstration (47.5%) or recent advances (39.5%). The residents were perceived to be the most benefited (65.3%). There was an equal preference for watching a webinar live or recorded (50.7% vs. 49.3%). Zoom Video Communications, Inc., was described as the platform that offers the best experience (43.8%). Webinars were considered to be better than conferences or continuing medical education (CME) activities (55.8%). The majority (43.8%) also preferred to get CME credit points by attending paid webinars. However, the broad consensus was that webinars should not completely replace the conferences (42.5%). Conclusion: Our survey evaluated the participants' perspective and the advantages and the disadvantages of a webinar and provides suggestions for the conduct of an ideal webinar with maximum active participation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 1716 nurses across three university hospitals participated in this study. All had been employed for at least one year. Managers, part-timers, and those in the operating room and the outpatient ward were excluded from the study as it is limited to bedside preventive care. The original tool was translated into Japanese using the Brislin's translation model. A cross-sectional study was used to examine the reliability and validity of the measure within a Japanese sample. Assessment of the multiple-choice test items included analysis of the validity (item difficulty and discriminating index), construct validity, internal consistency, and stability (test-retest reliability). RESULTS: The item difficulty indices ranged from 0.17 to 0.95, whereas values for item discrimination ranged from 0.15 to 0.45. Known group validity of the scale was confirmed; therefore, the higher-expertize group consisting of wound, ostomy, and continence nurses significantly outperformed nurses certified in other fields. The overall internal consistency reliability was 0.86 with a two-week test-retest intraclass correlation of 0.60. CONCLUSIONS: The instrument may be applied as a reliable and valid measure to assess nurses' pressure ulcer knowledge in the fields of nursing education, research, and practice in Japan.","Yamamoto-Kon, Aya; Fukahori, Hiroki; Ogata, Yasuko; Nagano, Midori",J. tissue viab,596,33

Social media interaction may elucidate public reaction and communication dynamics about COVID-19 in this critical period, during which communities may have formulated initial conceptions about the perceived severity of the pandemic. METHODS: Tweets were collected from the Twitter public API stream filtered for keywords related to COVID-19. Using a pre-existing training set, a support vector machine (SVM) classifier was used to obtain a larger set of geocoded tweets with characteristics of user self-reporting COVID-19 symptoms, concerns, and experiences. We then assessed the longitudinal relationship between identified tweets and the number of officially reported COVID-19 cases using linear and exponential regression at the U.S. county level. Changes in tweets that included geospatial clustering were also assessed for the top five most populous U.S. cities. RESULTS: From an initial dataset of 60 million tweets, we analyzed 459,937 tweets that contained COVID-19-related keywords that were also geolocated to U.S. counties. We observed an increasing number of tweets throughout the study period, although there was variation between city centers and residential areas. Tweets identified as COVID-19 symptoms or concerns appeared to be more predictive of active COVID-19 cases as temporal distance increased. CONCLUSION: Results from this study suggest that social media communication dynamics during the early stages of a global pandemic may exhibit a number of geospatial-specific variations among different communities and that targeted pandemic communication is warranted. User engagement on COVID-19 topics may also be predictive of future confirmed case counts, though further studies to validate these findings are needed.","Cuomo, Raphael E; Purushothaman, Vidya; Li, Jiawei; Cai, Mingxiang; Mackey, Tim K",BMC Public Health,596,30

However, few studies have been reported on developing multiplex ddPCR assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection and their performance. This study shows steps on how to develop different ddPCR SAR-CoV-2 assays including higher order multiplex assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection and antiviral screening. Methods: Using multiple primer/probe sets, we developed, optimized, and analyzed the performance of simplex (1 target), duplex (2 targets), triplex probe mix (3 targets), and quadruplex (4 targets) SARS-CoV-2 ddPCR assays based on a two-color ddPCR detection system. Results: Results showed that the quadruplex assay had similar limits of detection and accuracy to the lower multiplex assays. Analyzing 94 clinical samples demonstrated that the ddPCR triplex probe mix assay had better sensitivity than the RT-qPCR assay. Additionally, the ddPCR multiplex assay showed that remdesivir could inhibit the growth of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro while another testing drug could not. Conclusion: Our research shows that developing multiplex ddPCR assays is possible by combing probe mix and amplitude-based multiplexing, which will help in developing multiplexed ddPCR assays for different SARS-CoV-2 applications.","Nyaruaba, Raphael; Li, Changchang; Mwaliko, Caroline; Mwau, Matilu; Odiwuor, Nelson; Muturi, Elishiba; Muema, Caroline; Xiong, Jin; Li, Junhua; Yu, Junping; Wei, Hongping",Expert Rev Mol Diagn,596,5

In this overall scenario, the disinfection processes have been largely improved. For instance, some countries have approved no-touch technologies by vaporizing disinfectants such as hydrogen peroxide, with the overriding goal to boost the safety of the places. In the era of sustainability, we designed an electrochemical paper-based device for the assessment of hydrogen peroxide nebulized by a cost-effective ultrasonic aroma diffuser. The paper-based sensor was fabricated by modifying via drop-casting a filter paper-based screen-printed electrode with a dispersion of carbon black-Prussian Blue nanocomposite, to assess the detection of hydrogen peroxide at -0.05 V vs Ag/AgCl. The use of paper-based modified screen-printed electrode loaded with phosphate buffer allowed for monitoring the concentration of hydrogen peroxide in aerosol, without any additional sampling instrument to capture the nebulized solution of hydrogen peroxide at a concentration up to 7 % w/w. Hydrogen peroxide, a reconverted ultrasonic aroma diffuser, and the paper-based electrochemical sensor assisted by smart-phone have demonstrated how different low-cost technologies are able to supply an useful and cost-effective solution for disinfection procedures.","Fiore, Luca; Mazzaracchio, Vincenzo; Galloni, Pierluca; Sabuzi, Federica; Pezzola, Silvia; Matteucci, Giorgia; Moscone, Danila; Arduini, Fabiana",Microchem J,596,25

Although high seroprevalence could have been expected to trigger herd immunity and prevent further waves in the state, we have observed persistent levels of infection after the first wave and eventually the emergence of a second viral strain just before an augmented second wave. Our experiments suggest that the persistent levels of infection after the first wave may be due to reinfection, whereas the higher peak at the second wave can be explained by the emergence of the second variant and a low level of cross-immunity between the original and the second variant. Finally, the proposed model provides insights into the effect of reinfection and cross-immunity on the long-term spread of an unmitigated epidemic.","Arruda, Edilson F.; Pastore, Dayse H.; Dias, Claudia M.; Ourique, Fabricio O.",,596,2

Research relating to COVID-19 aims to determine the effects of the pandemic on vulnerable populations who are at high risk of developing negative health or psychosocial outcomes. Having an ongoing medical condition during a pandemic may lead to greater psychological distress. Increased psychological distress may be due to preventative public health measures (e.g. lockdown), having an ongoing medical condition, or a combination of these factors. METHODS: This study analyses data from an online cross-sectional national survey of adults in Ireland and investigates the relationship between comorbidity and psychological distress. Those with a medical condition (n = 128) were compared to a control group without a medical condition (n = 128) and matched according to age, gender, annual income, education, and work status during COVID-19. Participants and data were obtained during the first public lockdown in Ireland (27 March 2020-8 June 2020). RESULTS: Individuals with existing medical conditions reported significantly higher levels of anxiety (p < .01) and felt less gratitude (p &#8804; .001). Exploratory analysis indicated that anxiety levels were significantly associated with illness perceptions specific to COVID-19. Post hoc analysis revealed that psychological well-being was not significantly related to condition type (e.g. respiratory disorders). CONCLUSION: This research supports individualised supports for people with ongoing medical conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic, and has implications for the consideration of follow-up care specifically for mental health. Findings may also inform future public health policies and post-vaccine support strategies for vulnerable populations.","Stafford, Owen; Berry, Anna; Taylor, Laura K; Wearen, Sinead; Prendergast, Cian; Murphy, Eddie; Shevlin, Mark; McHugh, Louise; Carr, Alan; Burke, Tom",Ir J Psychol Med,596,16

SOURCES OF DATA: We identified studies in PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, AMED, Web of Science and Google Scholar using keywords including 'mindfulness', 'meditation', and 'review', 'meta-analysis' or their variations. AREAS OF AGREEMENT: MBIs are effective for improving many biopsychosocial conditions, including depression, anxiety, stress, insomnia, addiction, psychosis, pain, hypertension, weight control, cancer-related symptoms and prosocial behaviours. It is found to be beneficial in the healthcare settings, in schools and workplace but further research is warranted to look into its efficacy on different problems. MBIs are relatively safe, but ethical aspects should be considered. Mechanisms are suggested in both empirical and neurophysiological findings. Cost-effectiveness is found in treating some health conditions. AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: Inconclusive or only preliminary evidence on the effects of MBIs on PTSD, ADHD, ASD, eating disorders, loneliness and physical symptoms of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and respiratory conditions. Furthermore, some beneficial effects are not confirmed in subgroup populations. Cost-effectiveness is yet to confirm for many health conditions and populations. GROWING POINTS: Many mindfulness systematic reviews and meta-analyses indicate low quality of included studies, hence high-quality studies with adequate sample size and longer follow-up period are needed. AREAS TIMELY FOR DEVELOPING RESEARCH: More research is needed on online mindfulness trainings and interventions to improve biopsychosocial health during the COVID-19 pandemic; Deeper understanding of the mechanisms of MBIs integrating both empirical and neurophysiological findings; Long-term compliance and effects of MBIs; and development of mindfulness plus (mindfulness+) or personalized mindfulness programs to elevate the effectiveness for different purposes.","Zhang, Dexing; Lee, Eric K P; Mak, Eva C W; Ho, C Y; Wong, Samuel Y S",Br Med Bull,596,16

Materials and methods: This retrospective study consisted of 1874 persons-under-investigation for COVID-19 between February 7, 2020, and May 27, 2020 at Stony Brook University Hospital, New York. Two primary outcomes were ICU admission and mortality compared to COVID-19 positive patients in general hospital admission. Demographic, vitals, symptoms, imaging findings, comorbidities, and laboratory tests at presentation were collected. Predictions of mortality and ICU admission were made using machine learning with 80% training and 20% testing. Performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC). Results: A total of 635 patients were included in the analysis (age 60±11, 40.2% female). The top 6 mortality predictors were age, procalcitonin, C-creative protein, lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer and lymphocytes. The top 6 ICU admission predictors are procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase, C-creative protein, pulse oxygen saturation, temperature and ferritin. The best machine learning algorithms predicted mortality with 89% AUC and ICU admission with 79% AUC. Conclusion: This study identifies key independent clinical parameters that predict ICU admission and mortality associated with COVID-19 infection. The predictive model is practical, readily enhanced and retrained using additional data. This approach has immediate translation and may prove useful for frontline physicians in clinical decision making under time-sensitive and resource-constrained environment.","Hou, Wei; Zhao, Zirun; Chen, Anne; Li, Haifang; Duong, Tim Q",Int J Med Sci,596,29

In this manuscript we show that the RT-LAMP reaction has a sensitivity of only 200 RNA virus copies, with a color change from pink to yellow occurring in 100% of the 62 clinical samples tested positive by RT-qPCR. We also demonstrated that this reaction is 100% specific for SARS-CoV-2 after testing 57 clinical samples infected with dozens of different respiratory viruses and 74 individuals without any viral infection. Although the majority of manuscripts recently published using this technique describe only the presence of two-color states (pink = negative and yellow = positive), we verified by naked-eye and absorbance measurements that there is an evident third color cluster (orange), in general related to positive samples with low viral loads, but which cannot be defined as positive or negative by the naked eye. Orange colors should be repeated or tested by RT-qPCR to avoid a false diagnostic. RT-LAMP is therefore very reliable for samples with a RT-qPCR Ct < 30 being as sensitive and specific as a RT-qPCR test. All reactions were performed in 30 min at 65 °C.

When it comes to disability and education, ICT becomes a tool for social and educational inclusion. This study presents the validation and evaluation of a measurement scale on ICT literacy for inclusive education. In addition, based on previous literature, a conceptual model is proposed and validated through PLS (partial least squares) using a sample of 142 teachers from all educational stages. The results show that teachers' ICT knowledge to ensure inclusion consists of five dimensions on specific needs. ICT knowledge has a positive impact on teacher motivation and ICT use. Teachers at primary and early childhood education levels have a lower motivation and use of ICT, although they have a higher knowledge of disability. The results found allow progress to be made in measuring the educational inclusion of schools and the ICT knowledge needed to ensure care and support for all people. A notable implication is the need for training on ICT and disability within educational policies.","Medina-García, Marta; Higueras-Rodríguez, Lina; García-Vita, Mª Del Mar; Doña-Toledo, Luis",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),596,32

Beyond that threshold they take up their role in ""The Resolution of Inflammation"". The recognition of the SARS-CoV-2 antigen triggers an eicosanoid storm and initiates a robust inflammatory response. This establishes a positive feedback loop which develops into a sustained cytokine storm which interferes with the activation of adaptive immune cells. The mechanism of this interaction, and hence the pathogenesis of the virus with the immune system, is yet to be determined. In silico studies predict a direct SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein interaction with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which could impair macrophage function and initiate the cascade of events in severe infections. We here, add to the hypothesis that immune dysregulation can be caused by the interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein via a cryptic epitope with the &#945;7-nAChR in Type-1 macrophages, discuss its implications for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, and present better prospects for the design and dissemination of more effective vaccines and their importance.","Tanmay, Saraiya; Labrou, Dimitrios; Farsalinos, Konstantinos; Poulas, Konstantinos",Food Chem Toxicol,596,16

Many Asian countries are starting to vaccinate frontline workers; however, expedited vaccine development has led to hesitancy among the general population. We evaluated the willingness of healthcare workers to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. METHODS: From 12 to 21 December 2020, we recruited 1720 healthcare workers from 6 countries: China, India, Indonesia, Singapore, Vietnam and Bhutan. The self-administrated survey collected information on willingness to vaccinate, perception of COVID-19, vaccine concerns, COVID-19 risk profile, stigma, pro-socialness scale, and trust in health authorities. RESULTS: More than 95% of the healthcare workers surveyed were willing to vaccinate. These respondents were more likely to perceive the pandemic as severe, consider the vaccine safe, have less financial concerns, less stigmatization regarding the vaccine, higher pro-socialness mindset and trust in health authorities. A high perceived pandemic risk index, low vaccine harm index and high pro-socialness index were independent predictors in multivariable analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of healthcare workers in Asia are willing to receive COVID-19 vaccination. Perceived COVID-19 susceptibility, low potential risk of vaccine harm and pro-socialness are the main drivers. These findings may help formulate vaccination strategies in other countries.","Chew, Nicholas W S; Cheong, Clare; Kong, Gwyneth; Phua, Kailun; Ngiam, Jinghao Nicholas; Tan, Benjamin Y Q; Wang, Bokun; Hao, Fengyi; Tan, Wanqiu; Han, Xiaofan; Tran, Bach X; Hoang, Men Thi; Pham, Hai Q; Vu, Giang T; Chen, Yang; Danuaji, Rivan; Rn, Komalkumar; Pv, Meenakshi; Talati, Kalpesh; Ho, Cyrus S; Sharma, Arvind K; Ho, Roger C; Sharma, Vijay K",Int J Infect Dis,596,29

Hypoglycemia is a common barrier to achieving targets and can be associated with significant distress. However, the impact of hypoglycemia on QoL is not fully understood. The aim of this study was to explore how adults with type 1 diabetes are impacted by hypoglycemia in areas of life that are important to their overall QoL. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Participants responded to a web-based qualitative survey involving a novel 'Wheel of Life' activity. Responses were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis. RESULTS: The final sample included 219 adults with type 1 diabetes from Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, and the UK. They had a mean±SD age of 39±13 years and diabetes duration of 20±14 years. Participants identified eight areas of life important to their overall QoL, including relationships and social life, work and studies, leisure and physical activity, everyday life, sleep, sex life, physical health, and mental health. Participants reported emotional, behavioral, cognitive, and social impacts of hypoglycemia within domains. Across domains, participants described interruptions, limited participation in activities, exhaustion, fear of hypoglycemia, compensatory strategies to prevent hypoglycemia, and reduced spontaneity. CONCLUSIONS: The findings emphasize the profound impact of hypoglycemia on QoL and diabetes self-care behaviors. Diabetes services should be aware of and address the burden of hypoglycemia to provide person-centered care. Clinicians could ask individuals how hypoglycemia affects important areas of their lives to better understand the personal impact and develop tailored management plans.","Chatwin, Hannah; Broadley, Melanie; Valdersdorf Jensen, Mette; Hendrieckx, Christel; Carlton, Jill; Heller, Simon; Amiel, Stephanie; de Galan, Bastiaan; Hermanns, Norbert; Finke-Groene, Katharina; Speight, Jane; Pouwer, Frans",,596,14

METHODS: 246 patients were enrolled into COVID-19 cohort and 120 patients into influenza cohort. All data were collected and analysed retrospectively. The variables under focus included demographic, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and imaging characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia and comparison were made with influenza pneumonia. RESULTS: The COVID-19 cohort included 53.25% female and 46.75% male. Their main symptom was fever; while 28.05% of patients had only initially fever; 21.54% of them remained feverless. After excluding prior kidney diseases, some patients showed abnormal urinalysis (32.11%), elevated blood creatinine (15.04%) and blood urea nitrogen (19.11%). Typical CT features included ground glass opacity, consolidation and band opacity, which could present as characteristic 'bat wing sign'. Our data showed that male, aged 65 or above, smoking, with comorbidities including diabetes, cardiovascular and kidney diseases, would experience more severe COVID-19 pneumonia. In comparison, COVID-19 cohort showed significantly higher incidence of clustering; the influenza cohort showed higher rate of fever. Both cohorts showed reduced lymphocyte numbers; however, 6 influenza patients showed lymphocytes increased, which was statistical significant compared with COVID-19 cohort. Also, influenza cohort displayed higher white blood cell counts and PCT values. CONCLUSION: There is no significant gender difference in the incidence of COVID-19 pneumonia. It predominantly affects the lung as well as the kidney. Age, smoking and comorbidities could contribute to disease severity. Although COVID-19 is more infectious, the rate of secondary bacterial infection is lower than influenza.","Qu, Jiajia; Chang, Lap Kam; Tang, Xinghua; Du, Yiming; Yang, Xi; Liu, Xiangjiao; Han, Ping; Xue, Yuwen",Acta Clin Belg,596,29

Patients with severe pneumonia showed higher mean estimated systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP) (30.7 ± 5.2 mmHg vs 26.2 ± 4.3 mmHg, p = 0.006), even if in the normality range values. No differences in echocardiographic parameters were retrieved in patients with adverse events with respect to those with favorable clinical course. CONCLUSION: A mild sPAP increase in severe pneumonia patients with respect to those with milder disease was the only significant finding at early echocardiographic examination, without other signs of new onset major cardiac dysfunction. Future studies are needed to deepen the knowledge regarding minor cardiac functional perturbation in the evolution of a complex systemic disorder, in which the respiratory involvement appears as the main character, at least in non-ICU patients.","Ceriani, Elisa; Marceca, Azzurra; Lanfranchi, Antonio; De Vita, Stefano; Schiavon, Riccardo; Casella, Francesco; Torzillo, Daniela; Del Medico, Marta; Ruggiero, Diego; Barosi, Alberto; Cogliati, Chiara",Intern. emerg. med,596,19

The current study is focusing on the investigation and analysis of a fractional-order epidemic model that discusses the temporal dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in a community. It is well known that symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals have a major effect on the dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 virus therefore, we divide the total population into susceptible, asymptomatic, symptomatic, and recovered groups of the population. Further, we assume that the vaccine confers permanent immunity because multiple vaccinations have commenced across the globe. The new fractional-order model for the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 virus is formulated via the Caputo-Fabrizio fractional-order approach with the maintenance of dimension during the process of fractionalization. The theory of fixed point will be used to show that the proposed model possesses a unique solution whereas the well-posedness (bounded-ness and positivity) of the fractional-order model solutions are discussed. The steady states of the model are analyzed and the sensitivity analysis of the basic reproductive number is explored. Moreover to parameterize the model a real data of SARS-CoV-2 virus reported in the Sultanate of Oman from January 1st, 2021 to May 23rd, 2021 are used.

Hansen's disease is known to present as a complex immunological response to the lepra bacilli, resulting in its varied spectral manifestations. An interaction between these two infectious agents, hence, may affect Hansen's disease. We came across six cases of Hansen's disease who developed COVID19 co‐infection. This series presents their clinical course and outcome, during the period of co‐infection. All cases were followed up for a minimum eight‐week period thereafter. In all these cases the active phase of coronavirus infection had no effect on Hansen's disease and those on prednisolone for their lepra reaction had a more favorable outcome, with two cases manifesting exacerbation of their lepra reactions in the follow period.","Arora, Sandeep; Bhatnagar, Anuj; Singh, Gautam Kumar; Pal, Reetika; Bahuguna, Amit; Das, Pankaj; Verma, Prachi",Dermatol Ther,596,1

Remdesivir has been authorized for the treatment of COVID-19. We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the incidence of AKI in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The incidence of AKI in different subgroups was also investigated. METHODS: A thorough search was performed to find relevant studies in PubMed, Web of Science, medRxiv and EMBASE from 1 Jan 2020 until 1 June 2020. The systematic review was performed using the meta package in R (4.0.1). RESULTS: A total of 16,199 COVID-19 patients were included in our systematic review. The pooled estimated incidence of AKI in all hospitalized COVID-19 patients was 10.0% (95% CI: 7.0–12.0%). The pooled estimated proportion of COVID-19 patients who needed continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was 4% (95% CI: 3–6%). According to our subgroup analysis, the incidence of AKI could be associated with age, disease severity and ethnicity. The incidence of AKI in hospitalized COVID-19 patients being treated with remdesivir was 7% (95% CI: 3–13%) in a total of 5 studies. CONCLUSION: We found that AKI was not rare in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The incidence of AKI could be associated with age, disease severity and ethnicity. Remdesivir probably did not induce AKI in COVID-19 patients. Our systematic review provides evidence that AKI might be closely associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, which should be investigated in future studies.

The IBV strains circulating in poultry farms are serotypes/genotypes Italy02 and Massachusetts (Mass) identified during 2010–14. The appearance of these variants hinders the prophylactic strategy carried out by the breeders of the Moroccan poultry farm. To solve this problem, we have opted for the rational design of candidate vaccines in order to study the structure of the three-dimensional (3D) S1 spicule protein of serotype Italy02 and Mass H120, through molecular modeling, using the I-TASSER server, then the COACH, and another Meta server to determine and predict the common immunogenic active sites between these two IBV strains circulating in Morocco. The obtained results showed that the two strains studied had identical spatial conformation of the S1 protein structure with a similarity percentage of 81% and an average stability of the modeled sequences. Thus both serotypes share active antigenic sites common in the hypervariable region, located at residues 229, 230, 232, 233, and 235, with a magnesium molecule association around the Alanine 280 region responsible for stimulating immunogenicity. The quality of the 3D conformation, the stability, and the percentage make it possible to have accessibility to the common predicted neutralizing epitopes. Based on these data, we can conclude that it is highly probable that the H120 vaccine strain confers cross-protection against a challenge with new strains Italy02 circulating in Morocco.","Khataby, Khadija; Kasmi, Yassine; Souiri, Amal; Loutfi, Chafiqa; Ennaji, Moulay Mustapha",Emerging and Reemerging Viral Pathogens,596,32

Yet, because early models are built on limited information, it is unclear how long they will accurately capture epidemic dynamics. Using a stochastic SEIR model of COVID-19 fitted to reported deaths, we estimated transmission parameters at different time points during the first wave of the epidemic (March–June, 2020) in Santa Clara County, California. Although our estimated basic reproduction number ([Formula: see text]) remained stable from early April to late June (with an overall median of 3.76), our estimated effective reproduction number ([Formula: see text]) varied from 0.18 to 1.02 in April before stabilizing at 0.64 on 27 May. Between 22 April and 27 May, our model accurately predicted dynamics through June; however, the model did not predict rising summer cases after shelter-in-place orders were relaxed in June, which, in early July, was reflected in cases but not yet in deaths. While models are critical for informing intervention policy early in an epidemic, their performance will be limited as epidemic dynamics evolve. This paper is one of the first to evaluate the accuracy of an early epidemiological compartment model over time to understand the value and limitations of models during unfolding epidemics.","Childs, Marissa L.; Kain, Morgan P.; Harris, Mallory J.; Kirk, Devin; Couper, Lisa; Nova, Nicole; Delwel, Isabel; Ritchie, Jacob; Becker, Alexander D.; Mordecai, Erin A.",Proceedings.

Methods: Two groups of hospitalised children were included in this study: group 1 consisted of 1946 children hospitalised from 1st September 2004 to 30th May 2005, and group 2 consisted of 448 children hospitalised from 1st November 2003 to 30th March 2004. The respiratory specimens were tested by polymerase chain reaction. Results: In the first group, HBoV was detected by polymerise chain reaction in 11/828 (1.3%) of nasal specimens that tested negative for other respiratory viruses. One child tested positive for HBoV in both a nasal aspirate and stool sample. In the second group, nasal specimens were tested for all respiratory viruses, including HBoV. The presence of HBoV infection was detected in seven children (1.6%). Detection of a mixed viral population was observed in four of these children. The main symptoms in children infected with HBoV were rhinitis (50%), cough (45%), dyspnoea (28%), wheezing (28%), fever (23%) and diarrhoea (22%). The final clinical diagnoses were bronchiolitis (seven children), rhinopharyngitis (five children), the exacerbation of asthma (two children) and pneumonia (one child). Moreover, four children have associated gastroenteritis. Conclusion: These results contribute to the interest in the HBoV detection in children. HBoV detection in hospitalised children with or without any other respiratory virus detection was essentially associated with lower respiratory tract infection and in a lower score with upper respiratory tract infection and gastroenteritis.","Dina, Julia; Vabret, Astrid; Gouarin, Stephanie; Petitjean, Joelle; Lecoq, Julie; Brouard, Jacques; Arion, Alina; Lafay‐Delaire, Françoise; Freymuth, François",J Paediatr Child Health,596,32

However, previous studies mainly focused on risk prediction based on laboratory measurements at one time point, ignoring disease progression and changes of biomarkers over time. By using historical regression trees (HTREEs), a novel machine learning method, and joint modeling technique, we modeled the longitudinal trajectories of laboratory biomarkers and made dynamically predictions on individual prognosis for 1997 COVID-19 patients. In the discovery phase, based on 358 COVID-19 patients admitted between 10 January and 18 February 2020 from Tongji Hospital, HTREE model identified a set of important variables including 14 prognostic biomarkers.

The predictive model was successfully validated in two independent datasets (mean AUCs of 87.61, 87.55 and 87.03% for validation the first dataset including 112 patients, 94.97, 95.78 and 94.63% for the second validation dataset including 1527 patients, respectively). In conclusion, our study identified important biomarkers associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients, characterized the time-to-event process and obtained dynamic predictions at the individual level.","Chen, Xin; Gao, Wei; Li, Jie; You, Dongfang; Yu, Zhaolei; Zhang, Mingzhi; Shao, Fang; Wei, Yongyue; Zhang, Ruyang; Lange, Theis; Wang, Qianghu; Chen, Feng; Lu, Xiang; Zhao, Yang",Brief Bioinform,596,1

Methods: This was a retrospective, single-center research study. Participants were enrolled from patients presenting at the Chongqing Public Health Medical Treatment Center from Jan 24 to Feb 7, 2020, and were confirmed as having COVID-19. Results: A total of 114 COVID-19 patients (99 mild, 4 severe, 11 critical) of which 56 (56/114; 49.1%) were male, 58 (58/114; 50.9%) were female with a mean age of 46.05 years. Twenty nine (29/114; 25.44%) patients suffered from chronic diseases. Neutrophils counts in 23.68% (27/114) of patients were abnormally low and abnormally high in 21.05% (24/114). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and the C-reactive protein levels were abnormally elevated in 76.5% (62/81) and 62.9% (66/105) of patients, respectively. Creatine kinase isoenzymes (CK-MB), pro-brain natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP) and troponin levels were above the normal range in 7.10% (8/112), 66.7% (10/15), and 100% of patients, respectively. The percentage of patients in which the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO(2))/fraction of inspired O(2)(FiO(2)) ratio exceeded 200 was 60%. A total of 91 (91/114; 79.82%) patients displayed severe bilateral pneumonia, 52 (52/114; 45.61%) exhibited ground-glass opacity, and pulmonary consolidation was observed in 4 (3.51%) patients. Differences in shortness of breath, insomnia, inappetence, the procalcitonin (PCT) levels, FiO(2) and PaO(2)/FiO(2) among the three groups were statistically significant (p < 0.05). Differences between the mild and severe groups was observed in neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, CD4 expression, and levels of C-reactive protein, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and albumin (P < 0.05). Between the mild and critical groups, differences were observed in neutrophils, platelets, and CD4 expression (P < 0.05). A difference in C-reactive protein levels between severe and critical groups was also found (P < 0.05). Conclusions: In the majority of cases no gender differences were observed and mostly the symptoms were mild. Evidence of efficient human-to-human virus transmission was found. The elderly with comorbidities were more prone to develop into severe or critical illness. Age and comorbidity may be risk factors for poor outcome.","Yang, Ao; Qiu, Qian; Kong, Xianghua; Sun, Yanyu; Chen, Tingying; Zuo, Yujie; Yuan, Danfeng; Dai, Wei; Zhou, Jihong; Peng, Anzhou",Front Public Health,596,24

This study aimed at determining the prevalence of psychological distress and associated factors among the Ethiopian population during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed through an online survey using different online platforms. The questionnaire was created through Google Form and the survey link was administered by e-mail, LinkedIn, Telegram, and Facebook. Educated Ethiopian population who have access to the internet were invited to participate through an online survey and addressed to 929 respondents. The study participants completed the survey anonymously without any personal identifier. The psychological distress was assessed using the Kessler 10-item tool to measure psychological distress. Data were analyzed using SPSS and logistic regression to examine mutually adjusted associations, expressed as adjusted odds ratios. A generalized additive model was also employed to identify additional predictors using R. RESULTS: The prevalence of high psychological distress among the study population was 236 (25.5%). Of all respondents, 421 (45.1%) had low psychological distress, 274 (29.4%) had moderate psychological distress, 164 (17.6%) had high psychological distress, and 72 (7.3%) had very high psychological distress. Psychological distress increased with being at young and middle-aged adults, getting information from social media, and not correctly practicing infection prevention and control measures to prevent COVID-19 infection. Respondents with high perceived severity had increased psychological distress. On the contrary, those with the highest score of perceived response efficacy had low distress. CONCLUSION: Prevalence of psychological distress was substantial. The need for intervention of psychological distress inline with the prevention of COVID-19 is critically essential. The intervention target groups are those whose information sources are from social media, young and middle-aged adults, and those who do not correctly practice infection prevention and control measures against COVID-19 infection.","Ambelu, Argaw; Birhanu, Zewdie; Yitayih, Yimenu; Kebede, Yohannes; Mecha, Mohammed; Abafita, Jemal; Belay, Ashenafi; Fufa, Diriba",Ann Gen Psychiatry,596,19

However, there are several technical challenges coupled with sewage sampling for SARS-CoV-2, including intermittent shedding of viruses, sampling time, volume, and frequency. Sampling schemes thus may need to be tailored to reach out highly sensitive, accurate, and reliable results. Herein, we compared the accuracy and threshold cycle (Ct) profiles of SARS-CoV-2 in Moore swabs, composite (16-h), and grab samples taken from sewage manholes (n = 17) at the Middle Eastern city of Tehran, Iran, on two occasions (November 2020 and May 2021). Samples were concentrated by polyethylene glycol precipitation and the corresponding Ct values for CDC ‘N’ and ‘ORF1ab’ assays were derived by means of real time RT-qPCR. Overall, the Moore swabs performed equal to samples composited over 16 h for qualitative monitoring, and 34/34 (100%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The ‘N’ assay showed the highest detection frequency as compared to ‘ORF1ab’. The mean Moore swab Ct profiles were more consistent with 16 h composite sampling as compared with corresponding grab samples, providing hints as to the best sampling protocol to adopt when planning a sewage monitoring campaign particularly under WBE. Furthermore, our analyses on local differences showed somewhat higher virus copy numbers in the southern areas. The experimental design of this study revealed that the Moore swab and composite samples are more sensitive than grab samples, suggesting that the collection of grab samples may be inappropriate for characterizing total number of viral RNA copies in sewage samples. Given the transiently presence of human host-restricted infections such as SARS-CoV-2 and the simplicity and affordability of Moore swab, the method is well suited for disease surveillance in resource poor regions struggling with limited capacity for clinical testing.","Rafiee, Mohammad; Isazadeh, Siavash; Mohseni-Bandpei, Anoushiravan; Mohebbi, Seyed Reza; Jahangiri-rad, Mahsa; Eslami, Akbar; Dabiri, Hossein; Roostaei, Kasra; Tanhaei, Mohammad; Amereh, Fatemeh",Sci Total Environ,596,20

Deferment of elective surgeries and procedures coupled with a shift of resources toward increased inpatient clinical needs for the care of COVID-19 patients has resulted in substantially decreased imaging examinations at many institutions. Additionally, both infection control and risk mitigation measures have resulted in minimal on-site staffing of both trainees and staff radiologists at many institutions. As a result, residents have been placed in nonstandard learning environments, including working from home, engaging in a virtual curriculum, and participating in training sessions in preparation for potential reassignment to other patient care settings. Typically, for residents to gain the necessary knowledge, skills, and experience to practice independently upon graduation, radiology training programs must provide an optimal balance between resident education and clinical obligations. We describe our experience adapting to the challenges in educational interruptions and clinical work reassignments of 41 interventional and diagnostic radiology residents at a large academic center. We highlight opportunities for collaboration and teamwork in creatively adjusting and planning for the short and long-term impact of the pandemic on resident education.

Furthermore, animal studies of PD suggest that chronic stress may accelerate disease progression. Adequate self‐management strategies are therefore essential to reduce the detrimental effects of chronic stress on PD. Mindfulness‐based interventions encourage individuals to independently self‐manage and adapt to the challenges created by their condition. In PD, emerging clinical evidence suggests that mindfulness‐based interventions may reduce psychological distress and improve clinical symptoms, but insight into the underlying mechanisms is lacking. In this viewpoint, we provide a systematic overview of existing mindfulness trials in PD. Furthermore, we discuss the cerebral mechanisms involved in acute and chronic stress, and the impact of mindfulness‐based interventions on these networks. In addition, we delineate a hypothetical mechanistic framework of how chronic stress may increase the susceptibility for neuropsychiatric symptoms in PD and may potentially even influence disease progression.

As part of the process evaluation of a pragmatic trial of video visits in HBPC, we assessed clinician experience with video visit implementation. Methods: We assessed clinicians' experiences with and perception of the usefulness and appropriateness of video visits using anonymous surveys and brief qualitative interviews with a subset of survey participants. Qualitative analyses were guided by sociotechnical frameworks that emphasize technology's “value proposition” for its end users as being key to adoption. Results: Clinicians (36 physicians and 48 registered nurses) generally had favorable attitudes toward video visits and telehealth. Respondents felt confident in the skills needed to make their role in video visits successful. Clinicians were neutral on whether video visits were useful for their practice or enhanced the patient–caregiver experience. Clinicians found video visits to be most appropriate for follow-up care (as opposed to start of care). The interviews yielded two themes that complemented the survey findings: (1) factors enhancing the value proposition (positive responses from patients and families and convenience) and (2) factors diminishing the value proposition (issues related to the technology and scheduling). Discussion: Our findings provide insights into clinicians' experiences with implementing remote video physician consultations, facilitated by a nurse in the patient's home in the pre-COVID-19 era.

MATERIALS AND METHODS We utilized publicly available data from the urology match to compare dispersal patterns between applicants matching during the COVID-19 application cycle (2021) and those matching in the 5 prior application cycles (2016-2020). Variables included home state, undergraduate institution, medical school, and residency. Latitudes and longitudes were obtained for each institution and home state. The primary endpoint was distance (miles, as the most direct path) between medical school and residency program. We also assessed dispersal patterns by American Urological Association section. RESULTS Of the 1,965 applicants matching to a urology program between 2016-2021, medical school was identified for 1,956 (99.7%) applicants, undergraduate program for 1,551 (79%) applicants, and home state for 1,351 (69%) applicants. Comparing the COVID-19 application cycle to the 5 prior application cycles, there was no significant difference in the median distance between medical school and residency, undergraduate university and residency, or home state and residency. Similarly, there was no significant difference in the proportion of applicants matching at their home institution, matching from medical schools without a home urology program, matching from medical schools with a historically low volume of urology applicants (<1 matched applicant per year), or matching from a D.O.

This study examined the prevalence of anxiety and depression, including associated factors and coping methods among undergraduate students in a Nigerian university. It also examined the association between psychological state and family functioning. Methods: The study design was cross-sectional and involved 386 undergraduate students across the main faculties. The university's ethical review board approved the study with approval number UI/EC/20/0242. An online questionnaire, using Google form, was circulated among the students through their faculty representatives. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADs) was used in assessing anxiety and depression, while family functioning was assessed using the McMaster Family Assessment Device, (FAD). Data was entered into Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS), and analysis carried out using descriptive statistics, chi-square, independent t-test, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), Post-Hoc analysis and linear logistics regression, at 0.05. Results: The mean age was 21 {+/-} 2.9 years, with a female population of 60.1%. Prevalence of anxiety and depression were 41.5% and 31.9% respectively. Students in health-related faculties were significantly less anxious than those in other faculties. Inability to afford three square meals, negative family functioning, having a chronic illness and living in a State/Region with a high incidence of COVID-19, was significantly associated with depression. These factors jointly accounted for 14% of depression seen in undergraduate students. Most of the students coped by engaging themselves in social media, watching television/movies and participating in other online skill development programmes. Conclusion: There was a high prevalence of anxiety and depression among university students with poor family functioning, inability to afford three meals/day, living in a state with a high incidence of COVID-19 and having a chronic illness, contributing to depression. Measures need to be taken to support undergraduate students and their families to prevent the negative consequences of poor mental health.

Under pathological conditions, the extensive release of ATP induces sustained P2X7 receptor activation, culminating in induction of proinflammatory pathways with inflammasome assembly and cytokine release. These inflammatory conditions, whether occurring peripherally or in the central nervous system (CNS), increase blood-brain-barrier (BBB) permeability. Besides its well-known involvement in neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation, the P2X7 receptor may induce BBB disruption and chemotaxis of peripheral immune cells to the CNS, resulting in brain parenchyma infiltration. For instance, despite common effects on cytokine release, P2X7 receptor signaling is also associated with metalloproteinase secretion and activation, as well as migration and differentiation of T lymphocytes, monocytes and dendritic cells. Here we highlight that peripheral immune cells mediate the pathogenesis of Multiple Sclerosis and Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease, mainly through T lymphocyte, neutrophil and monocyte infiltration. We propose that P2X7 receptor activation contributes to neurodegenerative disease progression beyond its known effects on the CNS. This review discusses how P2X7 receptor activation mediates responses of peripheral immune cells within the inflamed CNS, as occurring in the aforementioned diseases.","Oliveira-Giacomelli, Ágatha; Petiz, Lyvia Lintzmaier; Andrejew, Roberta; Turrini, Natalia; Silva, Jean Bezerra; Sack, Ulrich; Ulrich, Henning",Front Cell Neurosci,596,21

Detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA using realtime reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the most common method to confirm a case. However, these tests have suboptimal sensitivity. Objective: The objective of the study was to estimate the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and deaths in Mexico, accounting for the probabilities of false-negative tests. Methods: We used publicly available, national databases of all SARS-CoV-2 tests performed at public laboratories in Mexico between February 27 and October 31, 2020. We used the estimated probabilities of false-negative tests based on the day of clinical sample collection after symptom initiation calculated previously. With the resulting model, we estimated the corrected daily number of cases, ICU admissions, and deaths. Results: Among 2,024,822 people tested in Mexico between February 27 and October 31 with an available result, we estimated 1,248,583 (95% confidence interval 1,094,850-1,572,818) cases, compared to 902,343 cases reported with positive tests. ICU admissions and deaths were 15% and 8% higher than reported, respectively.

612089,612089,612089,A novel information sharing framework for people living with type-2 diabetes in the context of a group education program,19.86034,6.3290315,2021-07-07,"Since the first appearance of the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) earlier this year, clinicians and researchers alike have been faced with dynamic, daily challenges of recognizing, understanding, and treating the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to SARS-CoV-2. Those who are moderately to severely ill with COVID-19 are likely to develop acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and require administration of supplemental oxygen. Assessing the need to initiate or titrate oxygen therapy is largely dependent on evaluating the patient’s existing blood oxygenation status, either by direct arterial blood sampling or by transcutaneous arterial oxygen saturation monitoring, also referred to as pulse oximetry. While the sampling of arterial blood for measurement of dissolved gases provides a direct measurement, it is technically challenging to obtain, is painful to the patient, and can be time and resource intensive. Pulse oximetry allows for non-invasive, real-time, continuous monitoring of the percent of hemoglobin molecules that are saturated with oxygen, and usually closely predicts the arterial oxygen content. As such, it was particularly concerning when patients with severe COVID-19 requiring endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation within one of our intensive care units were observed to have significant discordance between their predicted arterial oxygen content via pulse oximetry and their actual measured oxygen content. We offer these preliminary observations along with our speculative causes as a timely, urgent clinical need. In the setting of a COVID-19 intensive care unit, entering a patient room to obtain a fresh arterial blood gas sample not only takes exponentially longer to do given the time required for donning and doffing of personal protective equipment (PPE), it involves the consumption of already sparce PPE, and it increases the risk of viral exposure to the nurse, physician, or respiratory therapist entering the room to obtain the sample. As such, technology similar to pulse oximetry which can be applied to a patients finger, and then continuously monitored from outside the room is essential in preventing a particularly dangerous situation of unrealized hypoxia in this critically-ill patient population. Additionally, it would appear that conventional two-wavelength pulse oximetry may not accurately predict the arterial oxygen content of blood in these patients. This discordance of oxygenation measurements poses a critical concern in the evaluation and management of the acute hypoxemic respiratory failure seen in patients with COVID-19.","Rubano, Jerry A.; Maloney, Lauren M.; Simon, Jessica; Rutigliano, Daniel N.; Botwinick, Isadora; Jawa, Randeep S.; Shapiro, Marc J.; Vosswinkel, James A.; Talamini, Mark; Kaushansky, Kenneth",Ann Biomed Eng,596,5

During the initial period of the epidemic, public communication was effected through press releases and media coverage of the epidemic. About a month into the epidemic, a public education campaign was mounted to educate Singaporeans on SARS and adoption of appropriate behaviours to prevent the spread of the disease. A survey was conducted in late April 2003 to assess Singaporeans' knowledge about SARS and infection control measures, and their concerns and anxiety in relation to the outbreak. The survey also sought to assess their confidence in the ability of various institutions to deal with SARS and their opinion on the seemingly tough measures enforced. The study involved 853 adults selected from a telephone-sampling frame. Stratified sampling was used to ensure adequate representation from major ethnic groups and age groups. The study showed that the overall knowledge about SARS and control measures undertaken was low (mean per cent score of 24.5 ± 8.9%). While 82% of respondents expressed confidence in measures undertaken by Tan Tock Seng Hospital (the hospital designated to manage SARS), only 36% had confidence in nursing homes. However, >80% of the public agreed that the preventive and control measures instituted were appropriate. Despite the low knowledge score, the overall mean satisfaction score of the government's response to SARS was 4.47 (out of possible highest score of 5.00), with >93% of adult Singaporeans indicating that they were satisfied or very satisfied with the government's response to SARS. Generally, Singaporeans had a high level of public trust (satisfaction with government, confidence in institutions, deeming government measures appropriate), scoring 11.4 out of possible maximum of 14. The disparity between low knowledge on the one hand and high confidence and trust in the actions of the government on the other suggests that Singaporeans do not require high knowledge sufficiency to be confident in measures undertaken by the government to control the SARS crisis.","Deurenberg-Yap, M.; Foo, L.

Studies consisting of fundamentally different designs have been labelled as home-based, making searching for relevant literature challenging and time consuming. This issue has been further highlighted by an increased demand for these programmes following the COVID-19 pandemic and associated government-imposed lockdowns. Purpose: To examine what specifically constitutes home-based exercise by: (1) developing definitions for a range of terms used when reporting exercise and physical activity programmes and (2) providing examples to contextualise these definitions for use when reporting exercise and physical activity programmes. Methods: A literature search was undertaken to identify previous attempts to define home-based exercise programmes. A working document, including initial definitions and examples were developed, which were then discussed between six experts for further refinement. Results: We generated definitions for universal key terms within three domains (and subdomains) of programme design: location (home-based, community/centre-based, or clinical setting), prescription (structured or unstructured) and delivery (supervised, facilitated, or unsupervised). Examples for possible combinations of design terms were produced. Conclusions: Definitions will provide consistency when using reporting tools and the intention is to discuss the issues presented as part of a Delphi study. This is of paramount importance due to the predicted increase in emerging research regarding home-based exercise.","Denton, Francesca; Power, Sofie; Waddell, Alexander; Birkett, Stefan; Duncan, Michael; Harwood, Amy; McGregor, Gordon; Rowley, Nikita; Broom, David",Int J Environ Res Public Health,596,10

In particular, accurate modeling of lockdown effects on human behaviour and epidemic evolution is a key issue in order e.g. to inform health-care decisions on emergency management. In this regard, the compartmental and spatial models so far proposed use parametric descriptions of the contact rate, often assuming a time-invariant effect of the lockdown. In this paper we show that these assumptions may lead to erroneous evaluations on the ongoing pandemic. Thus, we develop a new class of nonparametric compartmental models able to describe how the impact of the lockdown varies in time. Our estimation strategy does not require significant Bayes prior information and exploits regularization theory. Hospitalized data are mapped into an infinite-dimensional space, hence obtaining a function which takes into account also how social distancing measures and people’s growing awareness of infection’s risk evolves as time progresses. This also permits to reconstruct a continuous-time profile of SARS-CoV-2 reproduction number with a resolution never reached before in the literature. When applied to data collected in Lombardy, the most affected Italian region, our model illustrates how people behaviour changed during the restrictions and its importance to contain the epidemic. Results also indicate that, at the end of the lockdown, around [Formula: see text] of people in Lombardy and [Formula: see text] in Italy was affected by SARS-CoV-2, with the fatality rate being 1.14%. Then, we discuss how the situation evolved after the end of the lockdown showing that the reproduction number dangerously increased in the summer, due to holiday relax, reaching values larger than one on August 1, 2020. Finally, we also document how Italy faced the second wave of infection in the last part of 2020. Since several countries still observe a growing epidemic and others could be subject to other waves, the proposed reproduction number tracking methodology can be of great help to health care authorities to prevent SARS-CoV-2 diffusion or to assess the impact of lockdown restrictions on human behaviour to contain the spread.","Pillonetto, G.; Bisiacco, M.; Palù, G.; Cobelli, C.",Sci Rep,596,16

METHODS: We conducted a systematic analysis of mortality and morbidity data for LRI and its specific etiologic factors, including pneumococcus, Haemophilus influenzae type b, Respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza virus. We used modeling methods to estimate incidence, deaths, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). We calculated burden attributable to known risk factors for LRI. RESULTS: In 2015, LRIs were the fourth-leading cause of DALYs, causing 11,098,243 (95% UI 9,857,095–12,396,566) DALYs and 191,114 (95% UI 170,934–210,705) deaths. The LRI DALY rates were higher than global estimates in 2015. The highest and lowest age-standardized rates of DALYs were observed in Somalia and Lebanon, respectively. Undernutrition in childhood and ambient particulate matter air pollution in the elderly were the main risk factors.

However, before implementation further clinical evaluation of test sensitivity is warranted. OBJECTIVES: To examine the performance of Abbott’s Panbio(TM) COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device for SARS-CoV-2 testing in a low to medium prevalence setting in Norway. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective study comparing the results of the Panbio RAT with PCR in 4857 parallel samples collected at a SARS-CoV-2 test station in Oslo, and from COVID-19 outbreaks in six Norwegian municipalities. RESULTS: A total of 4857 cases were included in the study; 3991 and 866 cases from the test station and the outbreak municipalities, respectively. The prevalence at the test station in Oslo was 6.3 %, and the overall sensitivity of the RAT was 74 %. Increased sensitivity was observed in patients who experienced symptoms (79 %) and when considering samples with viral loads above estimated level of infectivity (84 %), while it was lower in asymptomatic persons (55 %). In the outbreak municipalities, the overall prevalence was 6.9 %, and the total sensitivity of the RAT was 70 %. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the test correctly identified most infectious individuals. Nevertheless, the sensitivity is considerably lower than for PCR, and it is important that the limitations of the test are kept in mind in the follow-up of tested individuals.","Landaas, Elisabeth Toverud; Storm, Margrethe Larsdatter; Tollånes, Mette Christophersen; Barlinn, Regine; Kran, Anne-Marte Bakken; Bragstad, Karoline; Christensen, Andreas; Andreassen, Trude",J Clin Virol,596,1

METHODS: An online self-administered questionnaire was distributed among residents in the Saudi ophthalmology training programs between July 7 and 14, 2020. In this study, we explored residents’ opinions regarding training disruption and virtual education. The patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used to assess the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on their mental health. We used descriptive statistics for data analysis. RESULTS: Out of 183 registered ophthalmology residents, 142 participated in this study. Ninety-six participants (35.4%) were rotated at a specialized eye hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic, while 52 (19.2%) had rotations in the ophthalmology department at general hospitals. Those who rotated in both types of hospitals were 123 (45.4%). According to the participants, there was a significant decline in exposure to surgical and office-based procedures compared to emergency eye consultations (Friedman P <0.001). The COVID-19 pandemic’s effect on mental health was reported by 100 (70.5%) participants. Eighty-five (55.4%) respondents were satisfied with the virtual method of education. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted residents’ clinical and surgical training in the Saudi ophthalmology training programs. Additionally, we believe that COVID-19 may have a negative impact on trainees’ mental health. Fortunately, the current pandemic provided an innovative education method that will likely be used even after the pandemic.","Alahmadi, Adel Salah; Alhatlan, Hatlan M; Bin Helayel, Halah; Khandekar, Rajiv; Al Habash, Ahmed; Al-Shahwan, Sami",Clin Ophthalmol,596,25

Consistent with this proposal, several studies have shown that spoken word recognition is slowed when speech is produced by multiple talkers compared with when all speech is produced by one talker (a multitalker processing cost). Nusbaum and colleagues have argued that talker normalization is modulated by attention (e.g., Nusbaum & Morin, 1992, Speech Perception, Production and Linguistic Structure, pp. 113–134). Some of the strongest evidence for this claim is from a speeded monitoring study where a group of participants who expected to hear two talkers showed a multitalker processing cost, but a separate group who expected one talker did not (Magnuson & Nusbaum, 2007, Journal of Experimental Psychology, 33[2], 391–409). In that study, however, the sample size was small and the crucial interaction was not significant. In this registered report, we present the results of a well-powered attempt to replicate those findings. In contrast to the previous study, we did not observe multitalker processing costs in either of our groups. To rule out the possibility that the null result was due to task constraints, we conducted a second experiment using a speeded classification task. As in Experiment 1, we found no influence of expectations on talker normalization, with no multitalker processing cost observed in either group. Our data suggest that the previous findings of Magnuson and Nusbaum (2007) be regarded with skepticism and that talker normalization may not be permeable to high-level expectations.","Luthra, Sahil; Saltzman, David; Myers, Emily B.; Magnuson, James S.",Atten Percept Psychophys,596,16

Recently, the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has grown to be a global public health emergency but no effective drug is available to date. Several studies investigated MSCs therapy for COVID-19 patients. However, it remains unclear whether MSCs could be the host cells of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2) and whether they might affect the SARS-CoV-2 entry into other cells. Here, we report that human MSCs barely express ACE2 and TMPRSS2, two receptors required for the virus endocytosis, indicating that MSCs are free from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, we observed that MSCs were unable to induce the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in epithelial cells and macrophages. Importantly, under different inflammatory challenge conditions, implanted human MSCs failed to up-regulate the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the lung tissues of mice. Intriguingly, we showed that a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus failed to infect MSCs and co-cultured MSCs did not increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection in epithelial cells. All these results suggest that human MSCs have no risk of assisting SARS-CoV-2 infection and the use of MSCs as the therapy for COVID-19 patients is feasible and safe.","Cao, Yajun; Wu, Hongyan; Zhai, Wanli; Wang, Ying; Li, Mengdi; Li, Meng; Yang, Liu; Tian, Ye; Song, Yunhao; Li, Jun; Wang, Yinyin; Ding, Qiang; Zhang, Linqi; Cai, Ming; Chang, Zhijie",Stem Cell Res,596,20

Sequence comparisons were made from 1.2- to 8.9-kb segments on the 3′ end of the genome. FECV/FIPV pairs from the same catteries or shelters were 97.3–99.5% related but were genetically distinct from FIPV and FECV strains obtained from cats living in geographically distinct environments. The high genetic similarity between FECVs and FIPVs from the same environment strongly suggested a common ancestry. Based on the presence of deletion mutations in the FIPVs and not in the FECVs, it was concluded that FIPVs evolved as mutants of FECVs. The mutations are deletions in the FIPVs and not insertions in the FECVs since similar sequences are present in other strains that have segregated earlier from a common ancestor. Therefore, the order of descent is from FECV to FIPV. Mutations unique to FIPVs were found in open reading frames (ORFs) 3c in 4 of 6 isolates and/or 7b in 3 of 6 isolates. When the study was extended to include 7 additional FIPV isolates, 11/13 of the FIPVs sequenced were found to have mutated 3c ORFs.","Vennema, Harry; Poland, Amy; Foley, Janet; Pedersen, Niels C.",Virology,596,5

Objective: To evaluate the reliability of azithromycin disc diffusion testing against clinical isolates of typhoidal salmonellae in comparison with E-test minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). Study design: This is a cross-sectional validation study. Place and duration of the study: The Department of Microbiology, Pakistan Navy Ship Shifa hospital, Karachi from June 1 to December 31, 2020. Methodology: Antimicrobial susceptibility was performed by Kirby Bauer disc diffusion method for 60 isolates including Salmonella enterica ser. Typhi and Paratyphi A using Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI) guidelines. MICs by the E-test method were determined for Azithromycin only. Results: A significant proportion of the isolates (55%) had high azithromycin MIC in the wild-type distribution range (8-16 µg/ml). Ten (16.6%) isolates showed false resistance, i.e., zone diameter <13 mm by disc diffusion method when compared to E-test MIC results. Isolates with MICs close to breakpoint, i.e., 16 µg/ml were more likely to show discordant results. The sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, positive predictive value, and diagnostic accuracy of the disc diffusion method versus E-test were 100%, 83%, 100%, 9%, and 83%, respectively. Conclusions: Disc diffusion method as recommended by CLSI is not reliable for azithromycin susceptibility testing particularly for isolates with high MICs in the susceptible range. The E-test method may be a better alternative to disc diffusion provided appropriate training is done prior to its application.","Shoaib, Muhammad; Satti, Luqman; Hussain, Ashfaq; Khursheed, Nazia; Sarwar, Saba; Shah, Abid H",Cureus,596,16

Strong association between the HLA region and autoimmune disease (AID) has been established for over fifty years. Association of components of the HLA class II encoded HLA-DRB1-DQA1-DQB1 haplotype has been detected with several AIDs, including rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes and Graves’ disease. Molecules encoded by this region play a key role in exogenous antigen presentation to CD4+ Th cells, indicating the importance of this pathway in AID initiation and progression. Although other components of the HLA class I and III regions have also been investigated for association with AID, apart from the association of HLA-B*27 with ankylosing spondylitis, it has been difficult to determine additional susceptibility loci independent of the strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the HLA class II genes. Recent advances in the statistical analysis of LD and the recruitment of large AID datasets have allowed investigation of the HLA class I and III regions to be re-visited. Association of the HLA class I region, independent of known HLA class II effects, has now been detected for several AIDs, including strong association of HLA-B with type 1 diabetes and HLA-C with multiple sclerosis and Graves’ disease. These results provide further evidence of a possible role for bacterial or viral infection and CD8+ T cells in AID onset. The advances being made in determining the primary associations within the HLA region and AIDs will not only increase our understanding of the mechanisms behind disease pathogenesis but may also aid in the development of novel therapeutic targets in the future.","Gough, S.C.L; Simmonds, M.J",Curr Genomics,596,5

It is common to observe diffuse microvascular thrombi in multiple organs, mostly in pulmonary microvessels. Thrombotic risk seems to be directly related to disease severity and worsens patients’ prognosis. Therefore, the correct understanding of the mechanisms underlying COVID-19 induced prothrombotic state can lead to a thorough assessment of the possible management strategies. Hence, we review the pathogenesis and therapy of COVID 19-related thrombosis disease, focusing on the available evidence on the possible treatment strategies and proposing an algorithm for the anticoagulation strategy based on disease severity.","Carfora, Vincenzo; Spiniello, Giorgio; Ricciolino, Riccardo; Di Mauro, Marco; Migliaccio, Marco Giuseppe; Mottola, Filiberto Fausto; Verde, Nicoletta; Coppola, Nicola",J Thromb Thrombolysis,596,1

However, reports of its use and subsequent fatal arrhythmias in patients with Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) have raised concern regarding its cardiovascular (CV) safety. Therefore, we examined the relationship between HCQ use and corrected QT (QTc) length in SLE and RA patients without clinical CV disease (CVD). METHODS: One SLE (n=352) and two RA cohorts (n=178) with electrocardiograms (ECGs) collected as part of study data were analyzed. RA cohort participants were recruited from tertiary referral centers with additional referrals from community rheumatologists, while SLE subjects originated from the Columbia University Lupus Cohort. All patients met American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria for SLE or RA, and lacked known CVD. The exposure of interest was HCQ use and main outcome measure was QTc length [continuous or categorical (≥440 ms and ≥500 ms)]. RESULTS: Of the combined SLE and RA cohorts (n=530), 70% were HCQ users and 44% had a QTc≥ 440 ms. The adjusted mean QTc length was comparable between HCQ users vs non-users (438 ms vs 437 ms). In multivariable logistic models, HCQ use was not a significant predictor of a QTc≥440 ms for the entire cohort (OR 0.77; 95% Cl 0.48–1.23; p=0.27). Importantly, a QTc≥500 ms was inversely associated with HCQ use and not associated with arrhythmias or deaths. A significant interaction was found between HCQ use and use of anti-psychotics. Ultimately, the use of HCQ combined with any QTc prolonging medication as a group was associated with a QTc length (434 ms; 95%CI 430,439) which was comparable to that of use of HCQ alone (433 ms; 95% Cl 429,437). CONCLUSION: In a combined cohort of SLE and RA patients without clinical CVD, adjusted QTc length was comparable between HCQ and non-HCQ users, supporting its CV safety in patients with rheumatic diseases.","Park, Elizabeth; Giles, Jon T.; Perez-Recio, Thania; Pina, Paloma; Depender, Christopher; Gartshteyn, Yevgeniya; Askanase, Anca; Bathon, Joan; Geraldino-Pardilla, Laura",Res Sq,596,5

By analogy with other viral proteins that induce cell fusion the MHV S protein would be expected to have a hydrophobic stretch of amino acids that serves as a fusion peptide. Sequence analysis suggests that the S protein falls within the group of fusion proteins having internal rather than N-terminal fusion peptides. Based on the features of known viral fusion peptides, we identified two regions (PEP1 and PEP2) of MHV-A59 S2 as possible fusion peptides. Site-directed mutagenesis and anin vitrocell-to-cell fusion assay were used to evaluate the roles of PEP1 and PEP2, as well as a third previously identified putative fusion domain (PEP3) in membrane fusion. Substitution of bulky hydrophobic residues with charged residues within PEP1 affects the fusion activity of the S protein without affecting processing and surface expression. Similar substitutions within PEP2 result in a fusion-negative phenotype; however, these mutant S proteins also exhibit defects in protein processing and surface expression which likely explain the loss of the ability to induce fusion. Thus PEP1 remains a candidate fusion peptide, while PEP2 may play a significant role in the overall structure or oligomerization of the S protein. PEP3 is an unlikely putative fusion peptide since it is not conserved among coronaviruses and nonconservative amino acid substitutions in PEP3 have minimal effects on cell-to-cell fusion.","Luo, Zongli; Weiss, Susan R.",Virology,596,1

Further, effective therapeutic agents for COVID-19 are limited, and as a result, the identification of potential small molecule antiviral drugs is of particular importance. A critical antiviral target is the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro)), and our aim was to identify lead compounds with potential inhibitory effects. We performed an initial molecular docking screen of 300 small molecules, which included phenolic compounds and fatty acids from our OliveNet™ library (224), and an additional group of curated pharmacological and dietary compounds. The prototypical α-ketoamide 13b inhibitor was used as a control to guide selection of the top 30 compounds with respect to binding affinity to the M(pro) active site. Further studies and analyses including blind docking were performed to identify hypericin, cyanidin-3-O-glucoside and SRT2104 as potential leads. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that hypericin (ΔG = -18.6 and -19.3 kcal/mol), cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (ΔG = -50.8 and -42.1 kcal/mol), and SRT2104 (ΔG = -8.7 and -20.6 kcal/mol), formed stable interactions with the M(pro) active site. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay indicated that, albeit, not as potent as the covalent positive control (GC376), our leads inhibited the M(pro) with activity in the micromolar range, and an order of effectiveness of hypericin and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside > SRT2104 > SRT1720. Overall, our findings, and those highlighted by others indicate that hypericin and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside are suitable candidates for progress to in vitro and in vivo antiviral studies.","Pitsillou, Eleni; Liang, Julia; Karagiannis, Chris; Ververis, Katherine; Darmawan, Kevion K.; Ng, Ken; Hung, Andrew; Karagiannis, Tom C.",Comput Biol Chem,596,16

While pulmonary TB (PTB) is the most common manifestation, the proportion of extrapulmonary TB (EPTB) is increasing in low-burden countries. EPTB is a heterogeneous disease entity posing diagnostic and management challenges due to the lack of reliable biomarkers. In this study, we prospectively evaluated clinical data and treatment response which were correlated with different biomarkers. METHODS: The study was conducted at the University Hospital of Cologne. 20 patients with EPTB were enrolled. We analyzed plasma interferon-γ-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) levels in plasma by ELISA for up to 12 months of treatment. In addition, the QuantiFERON(®)-TB Gold Plus (QFT(®) Plus) test was performed during the course of treatment. Clinical data were assessed prospectively and correlated with QFT(®) Plus and IP-10 levels. RESULTS: Plasma IP-10 levels were found to be significantly increased (p < 0.001) in patients with extensive disease compared to patients with limited disease (cervical lymph node TB) or healthy controls. In patients with clinically confirmed paradoxical reaction (PR), a further increase of IP-10 was noted. IFN-γ measured by the QFT(®) Plus test did not decrease significantly during the course of treatment. Of note, in four EPTB patients (20%) without radiographic pulmonary involvement, sputum culture was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate that IP-10 may be a valuable biomarker for estimation of disease severity in EPTB and monitoring of the disease course in extensive forms. However, IP-10 may be less suitable for diagnosis and monitoring of EPTB patients with limited disease. The QFT(®) Plus test does not appear to be a suitable marker for therapy monitoring. Sputum should be examined in EPTB patients even in case of normal diagnostic imaging of the chest.

In addition to understanding the modes of transmission, the effectiveness of the mitigation methods also needs to be built into any effective model for making such predictions. We show that such complexities can be circumvented by appealing to scaling principles which lead to the emergence of universality in the transmission dynamics of the disease. The ensuing data collapse renders the transmission dynamics largely independent of geopolitical variations, the effectiveness of various mitigation strategies, population demographics, etc. We propose a simple two-parameter model—the Blue Sky model—and show that one class of transmission dynamics can be explained by a solution that lives at the edge of a blue sky bifurcation. In addition, the data collapse leads to an enhanced degree of predictability in the disease spread for several geographical scales which can also be realized in a model-independent manner as we show using a deep neural network. The methodology adopted in this work can potentially be applied to the transmission of other infectious diseases and new universality classes may be found. The predictability in transmission dynamics and the simplicity of our methodology can help in building policies for exit strategies and mitigation methods during a pandemic.","Paul, Ayan; Bhattacharjee, Jayanta Kumar; Pal, Akshay; Chakraborty, Sagar",Sci Rep,596,21

Patient experience survey results were retrospectively reviewed. All current providers and staff were invited to participate in an anonymous and voluntary survey focused on attitudes at the time of telehealth implementation. Results: During March 1 to July 31, 2020, there was significant increase in telehealth visits (n = 1,006) compared with the same period in 2019 (n = 22).

The telehealth attitudes survey showed more positive responses from providers than staff. The patient experience survey showed more favorable scores for telehealth visits compared with clinic visits. However, only about 50% of the respondents were satisfied with the technology in terms of ease and quality of connection during their telehealth visits. Conclusions: Telehealth was a satisfactory alternative to clinic visits in our academic pediatric ophthalmology practice during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Providers and staff had largely positive attitudes toward telehealth; however, future efforts should include strategies to increase staff buy in.

Despite having lengthy testing time, RT-PCR is a proven testing methodology to detect coronavirus infection. Sometimes, it might give more false positive and false negative results than the desired rates. Therefore, to assist the traditional RT-PCR methodology for accurate clinical diagnosis, COVID-19 screening can be adopted with X-Ray and CT scan images of lung of an individual. This image based diagnosis will bring radical change in detecting coronavirus infection in human body with ease and having zero or near to zero false positives and false negatives rates.

Multi-image augmentation makes use of discontinuity information obtained in the filtered images for increasing the number of effective examples for training the CNN model. With this approach, the proposed model exhibits higher classification accuracy around 95.38% and 98.97% for CT scan and X-Ray images respectively. CT scan images with multi-image augmentation achieves sensitivity of 94.78% and specificity of 95.98%, whereas X-Ray images with multi-image augmentation achieves sensitivity of 99.07% and specificity of 98.88%.

Due to its high transmissibility, many young university students have had to carry out their academic activities in mandatory social isolation, which could generate excessive anxiety. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the anxiety levels in Peruvian dentistry students developed during COVID-19 mandatory social isolation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An analytical, observational, and transversal study was carried out in 403 dentistry students in the last two years from three Peruvian universities from May to July 2020. The Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale was used to detect anxiety symptoms and their respective diagnoses. A logit model was used to evaluate the association of the variables: age group (X1), gender (X2), type of university (X3), and marital status (X4), with the anxiety levels of the students, considering a p-value less than 0.05. RESULTS: The prevalence of anxiety resulted in 56.8% (95% confidence interval (CI): 51.9–61.7) of 403 dentistry students. According to the multivariate logistic regression analysis, the type of university was the only variable that demonstrated to have a significant influence on the development of anxiety with an odds ratio (OR = 1.98; CI: 1.29–3.02); whereas the other variables such as age group (OR = 0.77; CI: 0.49–1.20), gender (OR = 1.15; CI: 0.72–1.84), and marital status (OR = 0.75; CI: 0.35–1.60) were not considered factors that influenced the development of anxiety. CONCLUSION: More than a half of the Peruvian dentistry students from three universities showed mild-to-severe anxiety levels. Students from a private university have a 98% higher chance of developing anxiety in comparison to students from public universities. Other variables such as gender, age group, or marital status were not considered influencing factors to develop anxiety.","Cayo-Rojas, César Félix; Castro-Mena, Manuel Jesús; Agramonte-Rosell, Regina de la Caridad; Aliaga-Mariñas, Ana Sixtina; Ladera-Castañeda, Marysela Irene; Cervantes-Ganoza, Luis Adolfo; Cervantes-Liñán, Luis Claudio",J Int Soc Prev Community Dent,596,16

This means there is an intimate connection between the biodiversity of the soil, the biodiversity and interrelationships of cultivated and wild plants and animals. This article looks through an ecological sciences perspective at the interconnections and interrelations between human health and Earth’s health. But regardless of the wide recognition of the benefits of biodiversity, we are seeing a political and economic landscape which actively runs contrary to and further erodes diversity in favor of the globalized industrial food system, seed uniformity and further centralization through false tech solutions. A food system which is responsible for both setting the preconditions for the severity of the global COVID-19 pandemic by weakening human and animal health through an explosion of non-communicable diseases. The way forward is instead shown by small farmers, local communities and gardeners who are already implementing biodiversity-based organic agroecology, which both preserves and rejuvenates the health continuum between the soil, plants, animals, food and humans.

Additionally, disruption of essential health services in the areas of maternal and child health, sexual and reproductive health services, care for chronic conditions and access to oncological and other specialist services has occurred. Thus, there may be avoidable excess morbidity and mortality from non-COVID-19 causes that is not justifiable by the current local COVID-19 burden. Measures to restore normalcy to essential health services provision as guided by the World Health Organisation and other bodies needs to be considered and implemented urgently, to avoid preventable loss of life and excess morbidity.

Objective to investigate the drug-induced liver injury associated with lopinavir-ritonavir among the patients with COVID-19. Methods We conducted a disproportionality analysis of US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) between 2020Q1 and 2021Q1 to evaluate the association between lopinavir-ritonavir and risk of drug-induced liver injury (or severe drug-induced liver injury) and calculated their reporting odds ratios (RORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results A total of 3,425 cases of drug-induced liver injury were reported in 19,782 patients with COVID-19. The ROR for drug-induced liver injury was 2.99 (2.59–3.46), 3.16 (2.68–3.73), and 5.39 (4.63–6.26) when comparing lopinavir-ritonavir with all other drugs, hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine only, and remdesivir, respectively. For severe drug-induced liver injury, RORs for lopinavir-ritonavir provided evidence of an association compared with all other drugs (3.98; 3.15–5.05), compared with hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine only (5.33; 4.09–6.94), and compared with remdesivir (3.85; 3.03–4.89). Conclusions In the FAERS, we observed a disproportional signal for drug-induced liver injury associated with lopinavir-ritonavir in patients with COVID-19.","Tang, Huilin; Zhou, Liyuan; Li, Xiaotong; Kinlaw, Alan C.; Yang, Jeff Y.; Moon, Andrew M.; Barnes, Edward L.; Wang, Tiansheng",Int J Clin Pharm,596,21

The PM approach focuses on the characterization of different phenotypes and pathogenic pathways in order to allow the selection of specific biomarkers that will be useful in disease management. Rhinitis is a highly prevalent and heterogeneous disease, both in terms of underlying endotypes and clinical presentations. Therefore, to apply the PM principles to the various rhinitis subtypes rise as a meaningful strategy to improve evaluation and treatment. RECENT FINDINGS: The technology of recombinant allergens has allowed molecular characterization of IgE reactivity of specific individual components of allergenic extracts. Recently published and ongoing clinical trials based on component resolved diagnosis (CRD) bring more precision to allergen immunotherapy for allergic rhinitis. Monoclonal antibodies against various cytokines involved in inflammatory allergic and nonallergic rhinitis endotypes show promissory results. SUMMARY: Better understanding of pathogenic pathways together with an accurate phenotype classification of patients presented with rhinitis symptoms contributes to point out clinical usefulness of biomarkers and other diagnostic tools, which leads to more accurate environmental control measures, personalized pharmacologic options, and new biological therapy developments.","Crisci, Carlos D.; Ardusso, Ledit R.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the level of physical activity (PA) of Czech children during COVID-19 in autumn 2020. METHODS: Ninety-eight Czech children (mean age = 10.1 ± 1.47 years) completed the standardized Physical Activity Questionnaire for Older Czech Children (PAQ-C/cz) during COVID lockdown. Data were compared with previously published norms. Thirty-five children also reported daily number of steps measured by accelerometers. RESULTS: Total PAQ-C score was 0.38 lower during COVID compared to Pre-COVID [t(302) = 5.118., p < .001]. The male PAQ-C total score was 0.37 lower [t(146) = 3.21., p = .002)] and the female total score was 0.39 lower [t(154) = 3.97., p < .001] during COVID compared to Pre-COVID. Specifically, responses of PA during spare time, before-school, physical education (PE), and recess were significantly lower during COVID. The average number of steps was 7.767 steps/day (boys = 9.255; girls = 6.982). CONCLUSION: COVID lockdown resulted in significant reduction of PA in Czech children. Strategies to promote adequate PA of children during the pandemic need to be determined.","Štveráková, Tereza; Jačisko, Jakub; Busch, Andrew; Šafářová, Marcela; Kolář, Pavel; Kobesová, Alena",PLoS One,596,8

When produced as fusions with convenient tags, they become reagents which pair their selective binding capacity to an orthogonal function. Several kinds of immunoreagents composed by nanobodies and either large proteins or short sequences have been designed for providing inexpensive ready-to-use biological tools. The possibility to choose among alternative expression strategies is critical because the fusion moieties might require specific conditions for correct folding or post-translational modifications. In the case of nanobody production, the trend is towards simpler but reliable (bacterial) methods that can substitute for more cumbersome processes requiring the use of eukaryotic systems. The use of these will not disappear, but will be restricted to those cases in which the final immunoconstructs must have features that cannot be obtained in prokaryotic cells. At the same time, bacterial expression has evolved from the conventional procedure which considered exclusively the nanobody and nanobody-fusion accumulation in the periplasm. Several reports show the advantage of cytoplasmic expression, surface-display and secretion for at least some applications. Finally, there is an increasing interest to use as a model the short nanobody sequence for the development of in silico methodologies aimed at optimizing the yields, stability and affinity of recombinant antibodies.","de Marco, Ario",Protein Expr Purif,596,8

Multiple promising targets have been identified that could lead to the development of potential therapies for ARDS; however, they have been limited because of difficulty with the mode of delivery, especially in critically ill patients. Nanobiotechnology is the basis of innovative techniques to deliver drugs targeted to the site of inflamed organs, such as the lungs. Nanoscale drug delivery systems have the ability to improve the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of agents, allowing an increase in the biodistribution of therapeutic agents to target organs and resulting in improved efficacy with reduction in drug toxicity.

Indeed, neutralizing titers of ≥1:160 have been recommended in some convalescent plasma trials for inclusion. Here we performed repeated analyses at one-month interval on 31 convalescent individuals to evaluate how the humoral responses against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike, including neutralization, evolve over time.

We fortuitously found that C3A was more susceptible to human coronavirus HCoV-OC43 infection than HepG2, which was attributed to the increased efficiency of virus entry into C3A cells. In an effort to search for the host cellular protein(s) mediating the differential susceptibility of the two cell lines to HCoV-OC43 infection, we found that ADAP2, GILT and LY6E, three cellular proteins with known activity of interfering virus entry, expressed at significantly higher levels in HepG2 cells. Functional analyses revealed that ectopic expression of LY6E, but not GILT or ADAP2, in HEK 293 cells inhibited the entry of HCoV-OC43. While overexpression of LY6E in C3A and A549 cells efficiently inhibited the infection of HCoV-OC43, knockdown of LY6E expression in HepG2 significantly increased its susceptibility to HCoV-OC43 infection. Moreover, we found that LY6E also efficiently restricted the entry mediated by the envelope spike proteins of other human coronaviruses, including the currently pandemic SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, overexpression of serine protease TMPRSS2 or amphotericin treatment significantly neutralized the IFITM3 restriction of human coronavirus entry, but did not compromise the effect of LY6E on the entry of human coronaviruses. The work reported herein thus demonstrates that LY6E is a critical antiviral immune effector that controls CoV infection and pathogenesis via a distinct mechanism. Importance Virus entry into host cells is one of the key determinants of host range and cell tropism and is subjected to the control by host innate and adaptive immune responses. In the last decade, several interferon inducible cellular proteins, including IFITMs, GILT, ADAP2, 25CH and LY6E, had been identified to modulate the infectious entry of a variety of viruses. Particularly, LY6E was recently identified as host factors to facilitate the entry of several human pathogenic viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus, influenza A virus and yellow fever virus. Identification of LY6E as a potent restriction factor of coronaviruses expands the biological function of LY6E and sheds new light on the immunopathogenesis of human coronavirus infection.","Zhao, Xuesen; Zheng, Shuangli; Chen, Danying; Zheng, Mei; Li, Xinglin; Li, Guoli; Lin, Hanxin; Chang, Jinhong; Zeng, Hui; Guo, Ju-Tao",bioRxiv,596,26

OBSERVATIONS: In this multicenter observational Case series, patients with DON were treated with teprotumumab, an insulin-like growth factor I receptor inhibitor (10 mg/kg for the first infusion then 20 mg/kg for subsequent infusions, every three weeks for a total 8 infusions). This study included patients with acute and chronic thyroid eye disease (TED) with DON who had failed conventional therapies and were not candidates for surgical decompression. Data collected included best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), color vision, RAPD when present, and orbital CT or MRI. Proptosis, clinical activity score (CAS), Gorman diplopia score (GDS), and Humphrey visual fields (HVF) were also evaluated. Ten patients (6 women, 4 men) with an average age 64 years old were included in this study. Mean follow up after completion of infusions was 15 weeks. Baseline visual acuity (VA) impairment ranged from hand motion (HM) to 20/25 in affected eyes. All patients had pre-treatment orbital CT or MRI that confirmed orbital apex compression. Seventy percent of patients had objective improvement in DON after 2 infusions of teprotumumab measured as significant improvement in visual acuity, resolution of RAPD, or both. After completion of treatment, affected eyes had a mean BCVA improvement of 0.87 logMAR (p=0.0207), proptosis reduction of 4.7 mm (p<0.00001), CAS improvement of 5.25 points (p<0.00001), and GDS improvement of 0.75 points (p=0.160). All 6 patients who presented with an RAPD had resolution or improvement of RAPD. All 7 patients who presented with color vision deficits had normalization or improvement of color vision. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPORTANCE: Teprotumumab infusions resulted in medical decompression and objective resolution or improvement of dysthyroid optic neuropathy. Most patients had rapid improvement of visual acuity and reversal of RAPD. Post-infusion imaging demonstrated reduction in extraocular muscle size that correlated with improvement in visual dysfunction. However, patients who presented with longstanding severe visual loss had limited improvement. There was no recurrence of DON after completion of teprotumumab in our cohort.","Sears, Connie M.; Wang, Yao; Bailey, Lucy A.; Turbin, Roger; Subramanian, Prem S.; Douglas, Raymond; Cockerham, Kimberly; Kossler, Andrea L.",Am J Ophthalmol Case Rep,596,1

Anticipatory intervention may still benefit local disease control efforts; however, infection risks are not the only focal concerns governing public demand for vector control. Concern for environmental contamination from pesticides and economic limitations on the frequency and magnitude of control measures also play key roles. Further, public concern may be focused more on ecological factors (i.e., controlling mosquito populations) or on epidemiological factors (i.e., controlling infection-carrying mosquitoes), which may lead to very different control outcomes. Here we introduced a generic Ross-MacDonald model, incorporating these factors under three spatial scales of disease information: local, regional, and global. We tailored and parameterized the model for Zika virus transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquito. We found that sensitive reactivity caused by larger-scale incidence information could decrease average human infections per patch breeding capacity, however, the associated increase in total control effort plays a larger role, which leads to an overall decrease in control efficacy. The shift of focal concerns from epidemiological to ecological risk could relax the negative effect of the sensitive reactivity on control efficacy when mosquito breeding capacity populations are expected to be large. This work demonstrates that, depending on expected total mosquito breeding capacity population size, and weights of different focal concerns, large-scale disease information can reduce disease infections without lowering control efficacy. Our findings provide guidance for vector-control strategies by considering public reaction through social media.","Jiao, Jing; Suarez, Gonzalo P.; Fefferman, Nina H.",PLoS Comput Biol,596,12

In this study, we developed an advanced methodology for identifying viruses across a spectrum of heart failure patients. We designed a custom tissue microarray from 78 patients with conditions commonly associated with virus-related heart failure, conditions where viral contribution is typically uncertain, or conditions for which the etiological agent remains suspect but elusive. Subsequently, we employed advanced, highly sensitive in situ hybridization to probe for common cardiotropic viruses: adenovirus 2, coxsackievirus B3, cytomegalovirus, Epstein–Barr virus, hepatitis C and E, influenza B and parvovirus B19. Viral RNA was detected in 46.4% (32/69) of heart failure patients, with 50% of virus-positive samples containing more than one virus. Adenovirus 2 was the most prevalent, detected in 27.5% (19/69) of heart failure patients, while in contrast to previous reports, parvovirus B19 was detected in only 4.3% (3/69). As anticipated, viruses were detected in 77.8% (7/9) of patients with viral myocarditis and 37.5% (6/16) with dilated cardiomyopathy. Additionally, viruses were detected in 50% of patients with coronary artery disease (3/6) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (2/4) and in 28.6% (2/7) of transplant rejection cases. We also report for the first time viral detection within a granulomatous lesion of cardiac sarcoidosis and in giant cell myocarditis, conditions for which etiological agents remain unknown. Our study has revealed a higher than anticipated prevalence of cardiotropic viruses within cardiac muscle tissue in a spectrum of heart failure conditions, including those not previously associated with a viral trigger or exacerbating role. Our work forges a path towards a deeper understanding of viruses in heart failure pathogenesis and opens possibilities for personalized patient therapeutic approaches.","Hanson, Paul J.; Liu-Fei, Felicia; Minato, Taylor A.; Hossain, Al Rohet; Rai, Harpreet; Chen, Victoria A.; Ng, Coco; Ask, Kjetil; Hirota, Jeremy A.; McManus, Bruce M.",Lab Invest,596,24

DESIGN: Matched cohort study. SETTING: Community based (pillar 2) covid-19 testing centres in the UK using the TaqPath assay (a proxy measure of VOC-202012/1 infection). PARTICIPANTS: 54 906 matched pairs of participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in pillar 2 between 1 October 2020 and 29 January 2021, followed-up until 12 February 2021. Participants were matched on age, sex, ethnicity, index of multiple deprivation, lower tier local authority region, and sample date of positive specimens, and differed only by detectability of the spike protein gene using the TaqPath assay. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Death within 28 days of the first positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. RESULTS: The mortality hazard ratio associated with infection with VOC-202012/1 compared with infection with previously circulating variants was 1.64 (95% confidence interval 1.32 to 2.04) in patients who tested positive for covid-19 in the community. In this comparatively low risk group, this represents an increase in deaths from 2.5 to 4.1 per 1000 detected cases. CONCLUSIONS: The probability that the risk of mortality is increased by infection with VOC-202012/01 is high. If this finding is generalisable to other populations, infection with VOC-202012/1 has the potential to cause substantial additional mortality compared with previously circulating variants. Healthcare capacity planning and national and international control policies are all impacted by this finding, with increased mortality lending weight to the argument that further coordinated and stringent measures are justified to reduce deaths from SARS-CoV-2.","Challen, Robert; Brooks-Pollock, Ellen; Read, Jonathan M; Dyson, Louise; Tsaneva-Atanasova, Krasimira; Danon, Leon",BMJ,596,9

Recent research on delivery of psychological services in hospices in the United Kingdom (UK) on a national level, including inequalities or variation in practice, is limited. A nationwide survey will highlight any differences in provision and in doing so help focus future research and inform best practice both within the UK, and internationally. The specific objectives of this survey are to (1) chart the types of psychological support available to adult patients in hospices in the UK in line with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence model; (2) explore how services are organised; and (3) gather service perspectives on adequacy of care, and facilitators and barriers to appropriate practice. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey emailed to adult hospices in the UK in November–December 2019. One staff member involved in the delivery and/or organisation of psychological support was invited to participate per hospice. Of 193 invited hospices, 116 took part. RESULTS: Sixteen percent rated their hospice psychological service as wholly adequate. The majority reported that services can access specialist professionals, but many relied on external referrals. Barriers to best practice included funding and staff capacity; facilitators included clear referral structures, audit and appropriate needs and outcome assessments. CONCLUSIONS: Access to psychological professionals has improved since the last survey 15 years ago, but the majority of responders felt their overall service was not wholly adequate. Basic emotional support is largely felt to be sufficient, but our results indicate a need for improvements in access to more specialist care. Partnerships with external mental health services may be key. Our findings highlight core facilitators and barriers to providing good psychological care at the end of life that should be considered by services both within the UK and on an international level.

Community health worker (CHW) incentives and remuneration are core issues that affect the performance of individual CHWs and the performance of the overall CHW programme. A better understanding of what motivates CHWs and a stronger awareness of the social justice dimensions of remuneration are essential in order to build stronger CHW programmes and to support the professionalization of the CHW workforce. METHODS: We provide examples of incentives that have been provided to CHWs and identify factors that motivate and demotivate CHWs. We developed our findings in this paper by synthesizing the findings of a recent review of CHW motivation and incentives in a wide variety of CHW programmes with detailed case study data about CHW compensation and incentives in 29 national CHW programmes. RESULTS: Incentives can be direct or indirect, and they can be complementary/demand-side incentives. Direct incentives can be financial or nonfinancial. Indirect incentives can be available through the health system or from the community, as can complementary, demand-side incentives. Motivation is sustained when CHWs feel they are a valued member of the health system and have a clear role and set of responsibilities within it. A sense of the “do-ability” of the CHW role is critical in maintaining CHW motivation. CHWs are best motivated by work that provides opportunities for personal growth and professional development, irrespective of the direct remuneration and technical skills obtained. Working and social relationships among CHWs themselves and between CHWs and other healthcare professionals and community members strongly shape CHW motivation. CONCLUSION: Our findings support the recent guidelines for CHWs released by WHO in 2018 that call for CHWs to receive a financial package that corresponds to their job demands, complexity, number of hours worked, training, and the roles they undertake. The guidelines also call for written agreements that specify the CHW’s role and responsibilities, working conditions, remuneration, and workers’ rights.","Colvin, Christopher J.; Hodgins, Steve; Perry, Henry B.",Health Res Policy Syst,596,22

As part of a mixed methods study designed to develop an equity-sensitive tool to support more equity-centred North-South GHPs, this critical interpretive synthesis examined reported assessments of GHPs. RESULTS: We examined 30 peer-reviewed articles for power dynamics, equity and inequities, and contradictions or challenges encountered in North-South partnerships. Among articles reviewed, authors most often situated GHPs around a topical focus on research, capacity-building, clinical, or health services issues, with the ‘work’ of the partnership aiming to foster skills or respond to community needs. The specific features of GHPs that were assessed varied widely, with consistently-reported elements including the early phases of partnering; governance issues; the day-to-day work of partnerships; the performance, impacts and benefits of GHPs; and issues of inclusion. Articles shared a general interest in partnering processes and often touched briefly on issues of equity; but they rarely accounted for the complexity of sociopolitical and historical contexts shaping issues of equity in GHPs. Further, assessments of GHPs were often reported without inclusion of voices from all partners or named beneficiaries. GHPs were frequently portrayed as inherently beneficial for Southern partners, without attention to power dynamics and inequities (North-South, South-South). Though historical and political dynamics of the Global North and South were inconsistently examined as influential forces in GHPs, such dynamics were frequently portrayed as complex and characterized by asymmetries in power and resources. Generally, assessments of GHPs paid little attention to the macroeconomic forces in the power and resource dynamics of GHPs highlights the importance of considering the broader political. Our findings suggest that GHPs can serve to entrench both inequitable relationships and unfair distributions of power, resources, and wealth within and between countries (and partners) if inequitable power relationships are left unmitigated. CONCLUSIONS: We argue that specific practices could enhance GHPs’ contributions to equity, both in their processes and outcomes. Enhancing partnering practices to focus on inclusion, responsiveness to North-South and South-South inequities, and recognition of GHPs as situated in a broader (and inequitable) political economy. A relational and equity-centred approach to assessing GHPs would place social justice, humility and mutual benefits as central practices—that is, regular, routine things that partners involved in partnering do intentionally to make GHPs function well. Practicing equity in GHPs requires continuous efforts to explicitly acknowledge and examine the equity implications of all aspects of partnering.

Since the first case was recorded on December 29, 2019, in Wuhan of China, the disease has rapidly extended to other nations of the world to claim many lives, especially in the USA, the United Kingdom, and Western Europe. To stay ahead of the curve consequent of the continued increase in case and mortality, predictive tools are needed to guide adequate response. Therefore, this study aims to determine the best predictive models and investigate the impact of lockdown policy on the USA’ COVID-19 incidence and mortality. This study focuses on the statistical modelling of the USA daily COVID-19 incidence and mortality cases based on some intuitive properties of the data such as overdispersion and autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity. The impact of the lockdown policy on cases and mortality was assessed by comparing the USA incidence case with that of Sweden where there is no strict lockdown. Stochastic models based on negative binomial autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity [NB INGARCH (p,q)], the negative binomial regression, the autoregressive integrated moving average model with exogenous variables (ARIMAX) and without exogenous variables (ARIMA) models of several orders are presented, to identify the best fitting model for the USA daily incidence cases. The performance of the optimal NB INGARCH model on daily incidence cases was compared with the optimal ARIMA model in terms of their Akaike Information Criteria (AIC). Also, the NB model, ARIMA model and without exogenous variables are formulated for USA daily COVID-19 death cases. It was observed that the incidence and mortality cases show statistically significant increasing trends over the study period. The USA daily COVID-19 incidence is autocorrelated, linear and contains a structural break but exhibits autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity. Observed data are compared with the fitted data from the optimal models. The results further indicate that the NB INGARCH fits the observed incidence better than ARIMA while the NB models perform better than the optimal ARIMA and ARIMAX models for death counts in terms of AIC and root mean square error (RMSE). The results show a statistically significant relationship between the lockdown policy in the USA and incidence and death counts. This suggests the efficacy of the lockdown policy in the USA.","Makinde, Olusola S.; Adeola, Abiodun M.; Abiodun, Gbenga J.; Olusola-Makinde, Olubukola O.; Alejandro, Aceves",J Epidemiol Glob Health,596,8

Professional soccer players were confined to home for 8 weeks and then a retraining period of 4 weeks was set before the first competitive match. When competition was resumed, professional soccer teams competed in a congested calendar (11 matchdays in 39 days) while some in-game regulations were altered (up to 5 substitutions, refreshment pauses). The current research presents an analysis of running patterns before suspension and after resumption of LaLiga to determine how the lockdown affected players’ physical performance. To aid in this purpose, a pairwise comparison was performed of running patterns of the 2019–2020 vs. 2018–2019 season (i.e., control season). Using a two-way ANOVA (season x matchday), it was found that there was no main effect of the season on total running distance per match (P = 0.288) nor in the distances covered < 14.0 km/h (P = 0.294), at 21.0–23.9 km/h (P = 0.266), and at ≥ 24.0 km/h (P = 0.112). Only the distance at 14.0–20.9 km/h was affected by the season (P = 0.019) with a lower running distance on matchday 34 in the 2019–2020 vs. 2018–2019 season. The number of substitutions (from 2.9 to 4.5 substitutions per game; P < 0.001) and match duration (96 vs. 100 min; P < 0.001) significantly increased after resumption respect to the previous season. These data suggest that high-intensity running performance of professional soccer teams was maintained after the resumption of the competition while the alterations likely aided in the in-game regulations facilitated the maintenance of soccer physical performance.","Brito de Souza, Diego; López-Del Campo, Roberto; Resta, Ricardo; Moreno-Perez, Victor; Del Coso, Juan",Front Physiol,596,6

In particular, road traffic injuries due to excessive daytime sleepiness are about 10–20%. Considering that aging is related to substantial sleep changes and the number of older adults with driving license is increasing, the current review aims to summarize recent studies on this issue. Further, we intend to provide insights for future research. Methods: From the 717 records screened, ten articles were selected and systematically reviewed. Results: Among the selected articles, (a) five studies investigated sleepiness only by self-reported standardized measures; (b) two studies assessed sleepiness also using a behavioral task; (c) three studies obtained objective measures by electroencephalographic recordings. Conclusions: The available literature on the topic reports several limitations. Overall, many findings converge in evidencing that older drivers are less vulnerable to sleep loss and sleepiness-related driving impairments than young adults. These discrepancies in sleepiness vulnerability between age groups may be ascribed to differences in subjects’ lifestyles. Moreover, it has been hypothesized that older adults self-regulate their driving and avoid specific dangerous situations. We believe that an easy protocol to objectively evaluate the vigilance level in elderly and young adults is required, and further studies are needed.","Scarpelli, Serena; Alfonsi, Valentina; Gorgoni, Maurizio; Camaioni, Milena; Giannini, Anna Maria; De Gennaro, Luigi",Brain Sci,596,21

The purpose of this study was to assess health care workers' views about respirator use and the features they prefer to be included in the next generation of respirators. METHODS: A 63-item survey was distributed to health care workers in 27 units of 2 tertiary care medical centers. RESULTS: From a total of 559 surveys distributed at both hospitals, 159 responses were returned (response rate, 28%). Survey results indicated that health care workers seek respirators that are more comfortable, interfere less with breathing, diminish heat buildup, are disposable, and permit the user to have facial hair. Multivariate analyses suggest that emergency department staff had 12.3 greater odds of wanting a new respirator (P = .031) as compared with their referent group. Males were more likely to indicate that the N95 respirator was comfortable to wear versus females (P = .003). CONCLUSION: To increase substantially the acceptance of respiratory protective equipment and improve compliance rates, respirators should be modified to meet the specific needs of health care workers.","Baig, Aliya S.; Knapp, Caprice; Eagan, Aaron E.; Radonovich, Lewis J.",Am J Infect Control,596,1

Cleavage of the S protein at the S1/S2 and/or S2’ site(s) is associated with viral entry, which can occur at either the cell plasma membrane (early pathway) or the endosomal membrane (late pathway), depending on the cell type. Previous studies show that SARS-CoV-2 has a unique insert at the S1/S2 site that can be cleaved by furin, which appears to expand viral tropism to cells with suitable protease and receptor expression. Here, we utilize viral pseudoparticles and protease inhibitors to study the impact of the S1/S2 cleavage on infectivity. Our results demonstrate that S1/S2 pre-cleavage is essential for early pathway entry into Calu-3 cells, a model lung epithelial cell line, but not for late pathway entry into Vero E6 cells, a model cell line. The S1/S2 cleavage was found to be processed by other proteases beyond furin.

Primary SARS-CoV-2 infection with systemic viral RNA release (RNAaemia) contributes to innate immune coagulation cascade activation, with both pulmonary and systemic immunothrombosis - including venous territory strokes. However, anti-SARS-CoV-2 adenoviral-vectored-DNA vaccines -initially shown for the ChAdOx1 vaccine-may rarely exhibit autoimmunity with autoantibodies to Platelet Factor-4 (PF4) that is termed Vaccine-Induced Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia (VITT), an entity pathophysiologically similar to Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). The PF4 autoantigen is a polyanion molecule capable of independent interactions with negatively charged bacterial cellular wall, heparin and DNA molecules, thus linking intravascular innate immunity to both bacterial cell walls and pathogen-derived DNA. Crucially, negatively charged extracellular DNA is a powerful adjuvant that can break tolerance to positively charged nuclear histone proteins in many experimental autoimmunity settings, including SLE and scleroderma. Analogous to DNA-histone interactons, positively charged PF4-DNA complexes stimulate strong interferon responses via Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) 9 engagement. A chain of events following intramuscular adenoviral-vectored-DNA vaccine inoculation including microvascular damage; microbleeding and platelet activation with PF4 release, adenovirus cargo dispersement with DNA-PF4 engagement may rarely break immune tolerance, leading to rare PF4-directed autoimmunity. The VITT cavernous sinus cerebral and intestinal venous territory immunothrombosis proclivity may pertain to venous drainage of shared microbiotal-rich areas of the nose and in intestines that initiates local endovascular venous immunity by PF4/microbiotal engagement with PF4 autoantibody driven immunothrombosis reminiscent of HIT. According to the proposed model, any adenovirus-vectored-DNA vaccine could drive autoimmune VITT in susceptible individuals and alternative mechanism based on molecular mimicry, vaccine protein contaminants, adenovirus vector proteins, EDTA buffers or immunity against the viral spike protein are secondary factors. Hence, electrochemical DNA-PF4 interactions and PF4-heparin interactions, but at different locations, represent the common denominator in HIT and VITT related autoimmune-mediated thrombosis.","McGonagle, Dennis; De Marco, Gabriele; Bridgewood, Charles",J Autoimmun,596,16

Various school-based mental health programs have been implemented worldwide, with greater emphasis placed on psychological and social aspects. The bio-psycho-social model provides a holistic and integrated view of mental health based on theory and research evidence. Given the importance of considering all three dimensions in mental health promotion, this study explored reasons for the relative neglect of this approach by studying the early phase of school well-being program development and implementation. Method: In total, 77 Hong Kong government-funded student well-being programs implemented in 2000–2009 were reviewed for the use of biological, psychological, and social interventions. Questionnaires and interviews were conducted to explore program leaders' usage and views regarding theoretical frameworks and evidence-based practice and program evaluation. Challenges encountered in the initial stage of school well-being program development and implementation were identified and analyzed. Results: Of the 77 programs reviewed, only 5 addressed all three bio-psycho-social factors of mental health. A significantly greater number of programs addressed psychological (n = 63) and social (n = 40) factors compared to those that covered biological factors of mental health (n = 13). Of 24 program implementers who responded to the online survey, 75% claimed to have studied or applied a theoretical framework yet only 41.7% considered evidence-based practices to be important. The majority of interviewed participants valued their own practical experience over theory and research evidence. Many programs lacked rigorous evaluation of clear objectives and measurable outcomes, thus the mechanisms of change and program effectiveness were uncertain. Perceived barriers to program adoption and continuation were identified. Conclusion: This study highlighted a neglect of the biological contribution to mental health in school well-being promotion initiatives, possibly due to lack of theoretical knowledge and evidence-based practice among program leaders and implementers in the early phase of school mental health promotion. The bio-psycho-social model should therefore be recommended for student well-being programs as a holistic and integrated theory of mental health underpinning program objectives, mechanisms of change, and measurable outcomes. To develop effective practices in student well-being promotion, more thorough documentation, a rigorous evaluation framework, and support for frontline educators to evaluate their practices were recommended.","Wong, Anna; Chan, Iris; Tsang, Christy H.

It is mandatory to attain and maintain good nutritional status to fight against virus. Nutritional status of individual is affected by several factors such as age, sex, health status, life style and medications. Nutritional status of individuals has been used as resilience towards destabilization during this COVID-19 pandemic. Optimal nutrition and dietary nutrient intake impact the immune system, therefore the only sustainable way to survive in current context is to strengthen the immune system. There is no evidence found that supplement can cure the immune system except Vit C, which is one of the best way to improve immune system. A proper diet can ensure that the body is in proper state to defeat the virus. However along with the dietary management guidelines the food safety management and good food practices is compulsory. This article explores the importance of nutrition to boost immunity and gives some professional and authentic dietary guidelines about nutrition and food safety to withstand COVID-19.","Aman, Faseeha; Masood, Sadia",Pak J Med Sci,596,30

Therefore, infection control measures are necessary to prevent infection of dental personnel during dental treatments. The use of a preprocedural mouth rinse with chlorhexidine (CHX), cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), or hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) solution for 30–60 s may reduce the viral load and may protect the personnel in a dental practice. In the present study the virucidal effect of the mouth rinsing solutions ViruProX(®) with 0.05% CPC and 1.5% H(2)O(2) and BacterX(®) pro containing 0.1% CHX, 0.05% CPC, and 0.005% sodium fluoride (F(-)) was investigated in vitro. The mouth rinsing solutions successfully inactivated infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles, the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), within 30 s. To determine the effective components, CHX, CPC, H(2)O(2), and a combination of CHX and CPC, were tested against SARS-CoV-2 in addition. While a combination of CPC and CHX as well as CPC alone led to a significant reduction of infectious viral particles, H(2)O(2) and CHX alone had no virucidal effect against SARS-CoV-2. It can be assumed that preprocedural rinsing of the mouth with ViruProX(®) or BacterX(®) pro will reduce the viral load in the oral cavity and could thus lower the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in dental practice.","Koch-Heier, Julia; Hoffmann, Helen; Schindler, Michael; Lussi, Adrian; Planz, Oliver",Microorganisms,596,20

Study design Longitudinal analysis of contacts identified from index cases. Methods A contact tracing study was carried out in the Northern Metropolitan area of Barcelona, Spain, during the inter-epidemic lapse of May to July 2020, a period of low SARS-CoV-2 incidence. Index cases were notified from the referral hospital. Contacts were traced and followed-up for 14 days. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed at day 0 and day 14 for contacts. Results In total, 368 contacts were identified from 81 index cases (median of 7 contacts per index case), from which 308 were traced successfully. The median age of contacts was of 28 years old, 62% (223 of 368) were males and 28 were non-nationals (34.1%). During the follow-up period, 100 contacts tested positive for COVID-19 (32.5% [95% confidence interval {CI} = 27.3–38.0]), with a secondary infection rate of 48.3% (95% CI = 40.8–55.9) among housemates. Clusters of index and respective contacts tended to aggregate within disadvantaged neighbourhoods (p < 0.001), and non-national index cases resulted in higher secondary infection rates compared with nationals (51.0% [95% CI = 41.0–60.9] vs 22.3% [95% CI = 16.8–28.8]; p < 0.001). Conclusions Disadvantaged communities experience a disproportionate burden of COVID-19 and may act as infection reservoirs.

Two-thirds of stroke survivors will require caregiver assistance. Evidence suggests the mental health of caregivers is closely related to patients' health outcomes. The timing of this study intersected with the beginning of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that required strict social distancing and hospital visitor policy changes. This study aims to answer the primary research question: What is the level and nature of stress experienced by caregivers of persons with newly-acquired stroke in the inpatient rehabilitation setting and how has the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the caregiver experience? METHODS: Recruitment occurred from a single inpatient rehabilitation facility. Participants were administered the Perceived Stress Scale and then completed qualitative semistructured interviews. The investigators used a phenomenological, iterative approach to collect and analyze qualitative data. The data were independently coded and categorized before consolidated into primary themes and subthemes. RESULTS: Eleven informal caregivers' perspectives generated 13 subthemes across 4 primary thematic categories: COVID-19 impact, concerns of the caregiver, coping strategies, and important aspects of the caregiver experience. COVID-19 social distancing necessitated new visitor policies, which presented additional challenges for caregivers. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Caregiver attendance at therapy sessions and frequent, direct communication between staff and caregivers improved caregiver readiness for family member discharge following inpatient rehabilitation. This study shared perspectives from a distinctive time during the COVID-19 pandemic. If visitation for multiple therapy sessions is prohibited, we recommend taking alternative measures to keep the caregiver involved in the plan of care.

In India, the pandemic precipitated a severe ‘crisis of mobility’, with migrant labourers in many major cities seeking to return to their hometowns. Their desperate attempts to return home by any means available rendered the lockdown ineffective in several areas, prompting clashes with authorities, last-minute policy relief and, eventually, the arrangement of transport measures. This paper aims to shed light on the vulnerability of India’s internal migrants in terms of their mobility, gender and mental health.

PARTICIPANT AND METHODS: A 30-year-old man with confirmed COVID-19 and bilateral acute conjunctivitis which occurred 13 days after illness onset. Based on detailed ophthalmic examination, reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was performed to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus in conjunctival swabs. The ocular characteristics, presence of viral RNA and viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in the conjunctival specimens were evaluated. RESULTS: Slit lamp examination showed bilateral acute follicular conjunctivitis. RT-PCR assay demonstrated the presence of viral RNA in conjunctival specimen 13 days after onset (cycle threshold value: 31). The conjunctival swab specimens remained positive for SARS-CoV-2 on 14 and 17 days after onset. On day 19, RT-PCR result was negative for SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 is capable of causing ocular complications such as viral conjunctivitis in the middle phase of illness. Precautionary measures are recommended when examining infected patients throughout the clinical course of the infection. However, conjunctival sampling might not be useful for early diagnosis because the virus may not appear initially in the conjunctiva.","Chen, Lu; Liu, Meizhou; Zhang, Zheng; Qiao, Kun; Huang, Ting; Chen, Miaohong; Xin, Na; Huang, Zuliang; Liu, Lei; Zhang, Guoming; Wang, Jiantao",Br J Ophthalmol,596,20

Extensive efforts have been dedicated worldwide towards determining the mechanisms of COVID-19 associated pathogenesis with the goals of devising potential therapeutic approaches to mitigate or overcome comorbidities and mortalities. While the mode of SARS-CoV-2 infection, its structural configuration, and mechanisms of action, including the critical roles of the Spike protein have been substantially explored, elucidation of signaling pathways regulating its cellular responses is yet to be fully determined. Notably, phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K) and its downstream pathway have been exploited among potential therapeutic targets for SARS-CoV-2, and its activation modulates the release of cytokines such as IL-8. To that end, the current studies were sought to determine the response of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 protein on PI3K-mediated IL-8 release using relevant and widely used cellular models. Overall, these studies indicate that PI3K signaling does not directly mediate Spike S1 protein-induced IL-8 release in these cellular models.","Borchers, Christina; Thyagarajan, Anita; Rapp, Christine M.; Travers, Jeffrey B.; Sahu, Ravi P.",Med Sci (Basel),596,1

A quick-to-be-identified cure for the disease will be a therapeutic medicine that has prior use experiences in patients in order to resolve the current pandemic situation before it could become worsening. Artificial intelligence (AI) technology is hereby applied to identify the marketed drugs with potential for treating COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An AI platform was established to identify potential old drugs with anti-coronavirus activities by using two different learning databases; one consisted of the compounds reported or proven active against SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, human immunodeficiency virus, influenza virus, and the other one containing the known 3C-like protease inhibitors. All AI predicted drugs were then tested for activities against a feline coronavirus in in vitro cell-based assay. These assay results were feedbacks to the AI system for relearning and thus to generate a modified AI model to search for old drugs again. RESULTS: After a few runs of AI learning and prediction processes, the AI system identified 80 marketed drugs with potential. Among them, 8 drugs (bedaquiline, brequinar, celecoxib, clofazimine, conivaptan, gemcitabine, tolcapone, and vismodegib) showed in vitro activities against the proliferation of a feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) virus in Fcwf-4 cells. In addition, 5 other drugs (boceprevir, chloroquine, homoharringtonine, tilorone, and salinomycin) were also found active during the exercises of AI approaches. CONCLUSION: Having taken advantages of AI, we identified old drugs with activities against FIP coronavirus. Further studies are underway to demonstrate their activities against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and in vivo at clinically achievable concentrations and doses. With prior use experiences in patients, these old drugs if proven active against SARS-CoV-2 can readily be applied for fighting COVID-19 pandemic.","Ke, Yi-Yu; Peng, Tzu-Ting; Yeh, Teng-Kuang; Huang, Wen-Zheng; Chang, Shao-En; Wu, Szu-Huei; Hung, Hui-Chen; Hsu, Tsu-An; Lee, Shiow-Ju; Song, Jeng-Shin; Lin, Wen-Hsing; Chiang, Tung-Jung; Lin, Jiunn-Horng; Sytwu, Huey-Kang; Chen, Chiung-Tong",Biomed J,596,20

Many agents have fulfilled the broad definition of emerging blood-transmitted infections, including West Nile virus (WNV), Trypanosoma cruzi, Plasmodium spp., Babesia spp., parvovirus B19, dengue virus, and the prions that cause variant Creutzfeld-Jacob disease (vCJD). Other agents such as human herpes virus- 8 (HHV-8—Kaposi’s sarcoma virus) and Borellia (Lyme disease) and, perhaps, avian flu virus, are known to have a viremic phase, but have not yet been proved to be transfusion-transmitted. In the wake of these threats, transfusion services use a variety of donor screening interventions, including serologic assays, nucleic acid assays, and geographic exclusions based on potential exposure. The ultimate safeguard may be a pre-emptive pathogen inactivation strategy that will disrupt all nucleic acid–containing agents (though not prions). Considerable effort and resources have been invested in this arena, but currently no single technique is effective for inactivation of both liquid and cellular blood products and toxicity issues have not been completely resolved. The blood supply is remarkably safe with the risk of major pathogens such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV now reduced to less than one transmission per 2 to 3 million exposures. However, to approach near-zero infectious disease risk for emerging and re-emerging pathogens, new strategies such as pathogen inactivation or multi-pathogen microarray technology will need to be developed or refined.","Alter, Harvey J.; Stramer, Susan L.; Dodd, Roger Y.",Semin Hematol,596,26

Hospitals consider tracheostomy after the patient is virus negative, usually after 3 weeks. Prevalence and timing of tracheostomy and its impact on survival among COVID patients are unknown. METHODS: A retrospective, single-center study of all patients with COVID-19 ARDS who underwent tracheostomy was conducted. Patients with age <18 and patients treated with ECMO were excluded. Duration of ventilation before tracheostomy was recorded. Clinical variables, outcome variables, and confounding variables were recorded and compared between patients with tracheostomy and without tracheostomy. The aim was to determine prevalence and timing of tracheostomy and its impact on clinical outcomes. RESULTS: We found that tracheostomies were performed only in 21 out of 196 patients (10.8%). Tracheostomies were performed after 3 weeks on average (22.1 ± 7.5 days). Survival was significantly higher in patients who underwent tracheostomy (85.7 vs. 42.5%, p = 0.001). LOSICU was longer for tracheostomy patients than patients without tracheostomy (median [IQR]: 35 [23–47] vs. 15 [9–21], p = 0.001). Patients who underwent tracheostomy had a higher proportion of treatment with continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) (52 vs. 30%, p = 0.04), more COVID-19 swab testing (6.5 [4.5–8.5] vs. 5 [3–7], p = 0.002), more days on mechanical ventilation (34.5 [24–45] vs. 11 [5.5–16.5], p = 0.001), and more length of stay in the hospital (54 [38–70] vs. 20 [10.5–29.5], p = 0.001). All other factors were not statistically different between the 2 groups. Approximately 29% of patients had possible false-negative testing as their swab became positive after being negative.

Drug and alcohol hospital consultation-liaison clinicians support emergency departments and other services provided in hospital settings in efficiently managing patients who use drugs and present with other health problems. COVID-19 will impact on staff availability for work due to illness. Patients may require home isolation and quarantine periods. Ensuring ongoing supply of opiate treatment during these periods will require significant changes to how treatment is provided. The use of monthly depot buprenorphine as well as moving from a framework of supervised dosing will be required for patients on sublingual buprenorphine and methadone. Ensuring ready access to take-home naloxone for patients is crucial to reduce overdose risks. Delivery of methadone and buprenorphine to the homes of people with confirmed COVID-19 infections is likely to need to occur to support home isolation. People who use drugs are likely to be more vulnerable during the COVID-19 epidemic, due to poorer health literacy and stigma and discrimination towards this group. People who use drugs may prioritise drug use above other health concerns. Adequate supply of clean injecting equipment is important to prevent outbreaks of blood-borne viruses.

We retrospectively assessed all patients admitted to an intensive care unit during the early COVID-19 surge (3/17/20–5/10/20) at our medical center in the midwestern USA for the presence of COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA). Patients were not routinely screened for CAPA; diagnostic work-up for fungal infections was pursued when clinically indicated. Among 256 patients admitted to the ICU with severe COVID-19, 188 (73%) were intubated and 62 (24%) ultimately expired within 30 days of admission to the ICU. Only three patients (1%) were found to have CAPA; diagnosis was made by tracheal aspirate cultures in two cases and by bronchoalveolar lavage fluid Aspergillus galactomannan in one case. None of the patients who developed CAPA had classic risk factors for invasive fungal infection. The occurrence of CAPA was much lower than that reported at other centers, likely reflecting the local epidemiology.","Wasylyshyn, Anastasia I.; Wasylyshyn, G.

This study aimed to identify whether experiencing bullying victimization based on gender and sexual orientation is associated with carrying a gun to school among adolescent boys. A cross-sectional analysis among a representative sample of high school boys (n = 3672) from the 2015 Maine Integrated Youth Health Survey was conducted. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were obtained using logistic regression analyses while controlling for grade level, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, suicidal ideation, alcohol and marijuana use, and gun access. Among the sample, 3.3% reported carrying a gun to school at least one time in the previous 12-months, 9.5% reported experiencing gender-based bullying victimization, and 7% reported experiencing sexual orientation-based bullying victimization. Regression analyses indicated that adolescent boys who experienced gender-based bullying victimization (OR 3.40, 95% CI 1.64, 5.62, p < .001) or sexual orientation-based bullying victimization (OR 3.57, 95% CI 1.91, 6.67, p < .001) had greater odds of reporting they carried a gun to school while controlling for grade level, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, suicidal ideation, alcohol and marijuana use, and gun access. These results expand upon previous gun carrying and bullying research by identifying the specific type of the bullying experienced and have important implications for social workers and school personnel. Importantly, these results emphasize the need to address two of the Grand Challenges for Social Work: building healthy relationships to end violence and ensuring the healthy development for all youth.","Ganson, Kyle T.; Nagata, Jason M.",Child Adolesc Social Work J,596,20

Although the licensing of several WNV vaccines for veterinary use provides a proof of concept, similar efforts on the development of an effective vaccine for humans remain still unsuccessful. Increased understanding of biology and pathogenesis of WNV together with recent technological advancements have raised hope that an effective WNV vaccine may be available in the near future. In addition, rapid progress in the structural and functional characterization of WNV and other flaviviral proteins have provided a solid base for the design and development of several classes of inhibitors as potential WNV therapeutics. Moreover, the therapeutic monoclonal antibodies demonstrate an excellent efficacy against WNV in animal models and represent a promising class of WNV therapeutics. However, there are some challenges as to the design and development of a safe and efficient WNV vaccine or therapeutic.

This study aimed to scrutinize the influence of Type A personality on the biochemical indicators of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and the behavioral indicators of appetite and sleep disorder, and to analyze the mediating effect of depression. Meanwhile, multiple-group path analysis was used to evaluate path differences between the models of two samples. The results of the mediation analysis for both samples demonstrated that depression significantly mediated the relationship between Type A personality and appetite and sleep disorder. The results of multiple-group path analysis showed that the relationship between Type A personality and appetite and sleep disorder seems to be significantly stronger in ordinary people, whereas the relationship between depression and appetite and sleep disorder, as well as with the path towards AST, seems to be significantly stronger in frontline anti-epidemic medical staff.

Incorrectly doffing personal protective equipment (PPE) increases the risk of transmission. A cheap, single-use variation of the face shield invented by a Singaporean team, SG Shield, aims to reduce this risk. This manikin study aimed to study the efficacy of the SG Shield in combination with standard PPE. METHODS A person attired in full PPE whose face and chest was lined with grid paper stood in front of an airway manikin in an enclosed room. A small latex balloon containing ultraviolet fluorescent dye was placed in the oral cavity of the manikin and inflated until explosion to simulate a cough. Three study groups were tested: (a) control (no shield), (b) face shield and (c) SG Shield. The primary outcome was droplet dispersion, determined quantitatively by calculating the proportion of grid paper wall squares stained with fluorescent dye. The secondary outcome was the severity of provider contamination. RESULTS The SG Shield significantly reduced droplet dispersion to 0% compared to the controls (99.0%, p = 0.001). The face shield also significantly reduced droplet contamination but to a lesser extent (80.0%) compared to the control group (p = 0.001). Although the qualitative severity of droplet contamination was significantly lower in both groups compared to the controls, the face shield group had more contamination of the provider's head and neck. CONCLUSION The manikin study showed that the SG Shield significantly reduces droplet dispersion to the swab provider's face and chest.","Au-Yong, Phui-Sze Angie; Chen, Xuanxuan; Low, Wen Hao; Chau, Keen Chong; Fook-Chong, Stephanie; Khan, Shariq Ali",Singapore medical journal,596,24

In Bangladesh, Astra Zeneca (AZ) vaccine was provided, but patients had infections of SARS COV 2 even after vaccination. We focused on observing the severity, oxygen requirement and outcome of the COVID-19 infected patients who took the first dose or completed the immunization regimen. Methods: This is an observational study done among 174 COVID 19 patients from three COVID 19 dedicated hospitals of Chattogram, Bangladesh, who took AZ vaccines 1st dose or completed the schedule. All patients were Real-Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT PCR) positive for COVID 19. Patients were enrolled after receiving written informed consent. Suspected cases or unwilling patients were excluded from the study. Ethical approval was granted by the CMOSH ERB. SPSS 20 was used to analyze the information gathered. Results: Among 174 vaccinated patients, 55(31.61%) completed the vaccination schedule, and 119(68.39%) took their 1st dose of the COVID 19 vaccine. Gender distributions revealed 67(38.5%) female and 107(61.5%) male got the vaccine, and 55 patients completed the full two doses, and 119 patients took the 1st dose. Most of the patients were 40 years and above. In the completed vaccination group, 33(60.0%) out of 55 in and in the first dose vaccinated group, 75(63.0%) out of 119 had a mild COVID 19, and severe and critical cases were found very minimum. Among the patients who have completed the vaccination, 32(58.2%) needed no oxygen, and who was given the first dose, 78(65%) needed no oxygen. No death occurred who completed the vaccine, and 3(2.5%) patients died who took 1st dose of the vaccine. Conclusion: Vaccine provided in Bangladesh to the people so far seems safe and effective. Severe and critical COVID 19 is low, and the need for oxygen to admitted patients is less, and the death rate is minimal.","Das, S.; Tumpa, N. I.; Khan, A. A.; Hoque, M. M.; Hoque, M.

In the present study, the application of a multiplex RT‐PCR DNA microarray in diagnosis and epidemiological survey of viral infections in infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis was assessed. One hundred and thirty‐eight nasopharyngeal aspirates collected from October 2007 to September 2008 were tested by direct immunofluorescence and viral culture, a combination of referenced RT‐PCRs and the DNA microarray. One or more viruses were detected in 96, 126 and 126 of the specimens by direct immunofluorescence and viral culture, RT‐PCRs and DNA microarray, respectively (70 vs. 91 vs. 91%, P < 10(−3)). The RT‐PCRs and the DNA microarray yielded concordant results for 99% of specimens and identified mixed viral infections in 85 (62%). The most common associations were: human bocavirus and respiratory syncytial virus (32%), adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus (30%), and parainfluenza virus type 3 and respiratory syncytial virus (23%). None of the bronchiolitis severity parameters including intensive care unit admission, O(2) supply, O(2) saturation percentage, O(2) length and length of stay at the hospital appeared to be significantly increased in multiple viral infections compared to single viral infections (P > 0.1). In conclusion, the use of this DNA microarray in clinical virology practice allows rapid and accurate identification of common and uncommon viral respiratory pathogens in infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis.

The knowledge of the epidemiological/clinical profile and the risk factors of Brazilian COVID-19 patients can assist in the decision making of physicians in the implementation of early and most appropriate measures for poor prognosis patients. However, these reports are missing. Here we present a comprehensive study that addresses this demand. Methods: This data-driven study was based on the Brazilian Ministry of Health Database (SIVEP-Gripe, 2020) regarding notified cases of hospitalized COVID-19 patients during the period from February 26 to August 10, 2020. Demographic data, clinical symptoms, comorbidities and other additional information of patients were analyzed. Results: The hospitalization rate was higher for male gender (56.56%) and for older age patients of both sexes. Overall, the mortality rate was quite high (41.28%) among hospitalized patients, especially those over 60 years of age. Most prevalent symptoms were cough, dyspnoea, fever, low oxygen saturation and respiratory distress. Heart disease, diabetes, obesity, kidney disease, neurological disease, and pneumopathy were the most prevalent comorbidities. A high prevalence of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with heart disease (65.7%) and diabetes (53.55%) and with a high mortality rate of around 50% was observed. The ICU admission rate was 39.37% and of these 62.4% died. 24.4% of patients required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), with high mortality among them (82.98%). The main mortality risk predictors were older age and IMV requirement. In addition, socioeconomic conditions have been shown to significantly influence the disease outcome, regardless of age and comorbidities. Conclusion: Our study provides a comprehensive overview of the hospitalized Brazilian COVID-19 patients profile and the mortality risk factors. The analysis also evidenced that the disease outcome is influenced by multiple factors, as unequally affects different segments of population.","Souza, F. S. H.; Hojo-Souza, N. S.; Batista, B. D. d.

The studies on this policy include physical filtering tests with inanimate microparticles, randomized clinical trials, observational studies, ecological analyses, and even computational modeling of epidemics. Much of the so-called evidence is inferred from studies on different respiratory viruses and epidemiological settings. Heterogeneity is a major factor limiting the generalization of inferences. In this article, we reviewed the empirical and rational bases of mask use and how to understand these recommendations compared to other policies of social distancing, restrictions on non-essential services, and lockdown. We conclude that recent studies suggest a synergistic effect of the use of masks and social distancing rather than opposing effects of the two recommendations. Developing social communication approaches that clarify the need to combine different strategies is a challenge for public health authorities.","Fortaleza, Cristiane Ravagnani; de Souza, Lenice do Rosário; Rúgolo, Juliana Machado; Fortaleza, Carlos Magno Castelo Branco",Revista da Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical,596,1

The aim of the current study was to explore the health implications of COVID‐19 AMong a sample of adults with obesity. METHODS: A retrospective medical chart review identified patients with obesity from an obesity medicine clinic and a bariatric surgery (MBS) practice. Patients completed an online survey from April 15, 2020 to May 31, 2020 to assess COVID‐19 status and health behaviors during stay‐at‐home orders. Logistic regression models examined the impact of these orders on anxiety and depression by ethnic group. RESULTS: A total of 123 patients (87% female, mean age 51.2 years [SD 13.0], mean BMI 40.2 [SD 6.7], 49.2% Non‐Hispanic white, 28.7% Non‐Hispanic black, 16.4% Hispanic, 7% other ethnicity, 33.1% completed MBS were included. Two patients tested positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 and 14.6% reported symptoms. 72.8% reported increased anxiety and 83.6% increased depression since stay‐at‐home orders were initiated. 69.6% reported more difficultly in achieving weight loss goals, less exercise time (47.9%) and intensity (55.8%), increased stockpiling of food (49.6%) and stress eating (61.2%).

As a recent example, the β-coronavirus family virion, SARS-CoV-2, has quickly evolved as a pandemic leading to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and has been declared by the World Health Organization as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. To date, no definitive treatment or vaccine application exists for COVID-19. Although new investigations seek to repurpose existing antiviral treatments for COVID-19, innovative treatment strategies not normally considered to have antiviral capabilities may be critical to address this global concern. One such avenue that may prove to be exceedingly fruitful and offer exciting potential as new antiviral therapy involves the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and its associated pathways of mTOR Complex 1 (mTORC1), mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2), and AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK). Recent work has shown that mTOR pathways in conjunction with AMPK may offer valuable targets to control cell injury, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and the onset of hyperinflammation, a significant disability associated with COVID-19. Furthermore, pathways that can activate mTOR may be necessary for anti-hepatitis C activity, reduction of influenza A virus replication, and vital for type-1 interferon responses with influenza vaccination. Yet, important considerations for the development of safe and effective antiviral therapy with mTOR pathways exist. Under some conditions, mTOR can act as a double edge sword and participate in virion replication and virion release from cells. Future work with mTOR as a potential antiviral target is highly warranted and with a greater understanding of this novel pathway, new treatments against several viral pathogens may successfully emerge.","Maiese, Kenneth",Curr Neurovasc Res,596,8

The median knowledge score was 10.0 (range 0-12). Being male (ß: -0.437; p=0.003) and older (ß: -0.028; p<0.001) were associated with lower knowledge scores, while being single (ß: 1.026; p<0.001) and mental labour employee (ß: 0.402; p=0.032) were associated with higher knowledge scores. The vast majority of subjects had not visited crowded places, 630 (61.0%) and wearing masks when they were going out, 928 (89.9%). Being female (OR=0.731; p=0.022), having higher knowledge scores (OR=0.929; p=0.017) and being a mental labour employee (OR=0.713; p=0.031) decreased the exposure to crowded places. High school or lower education level (OR=0.616; p=0.024) decreased the action of wearing a mask in public places, while higher knowledge scores (OR=1.112; p=0.013) increased it. Conclusion Our study suggests that residents of the selected regions have had good knowledge, pessimistic attitudes and relatively appropriate practices towards COVID-19 during the second wave of the outbreak.","Sljivo, Armin; Bhattacharyya, Sutanay; Mulac, Ahmed; Abdulkhaliq, Arian; Sahatçiu, Rexhep","Medicinski glasnik : official publication of the Medical Association of Zenica-Doboj Canton, Bosnia and Herzegovina",596,16

We hypothesize that certain miRNAs could simultaneously target multiple genes, are significantly conserved across many species, thereby demonstrating the potential to serve as diagnostic or therapeutic tools for bovine coronavirus infection. To this end, we utilized different existing and publicly available computational tools to conduct system analysis predicting important miRNAs that could affect BCoV pathogenesis. Eleven genes including CEBPD, IRF1, TLR9, SRC, and RHOA, significantly indicated in immune-related pathways, were identified to be associated with BCoV, and implicated in other coronaviruses. Of the 70 miRNAs predicted to target the identified genes, four concomitant miRNAs (bta-miR-11975, bta-miR-11976, bta-miR-22-3p, and bta-miR-2325c) were found. Examining the gene interaction network suggests IL-6, IRF1, and TP53 as key drivers. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that miR-22 was completely conserved across all 14 species it was searched against, suggesting a shared and important functional role. Functional annotation and associated pathways of target genes, such as positive regulation of cytokine production, IL-6 signaling pathway, and regulation of leukocyte differentiation, indicate the miRNAs are major participants in multiple aspects of both innate and adaptive immune response. Examination of variants evinced a potentially deleterious SNP in bta-miR-22-3p and an advantageous SNP in bta-miR-2325c. Conclusively, this study provides new insight into miRNAs regulating genes responding to BCoV infection, with bta-miR-22-3p particularly indicated as a potential drug target or diagnostic marker for bovine coronavirus.","Morenikeji, Olanrewaju B.; Wallace, Madeleine; Strutton, Ellis; Bernard, Kahleel; Yip, Elaine; Thomas, Bolaji N.",Front Genet,596,1

It causes an imbalance between people by creating a more desirable living environment for some societies while erasing settlements and shelters of some others. Due to floods, sea level rise, destructive storms, drought, and slow-onset factors such as salinization of water and soil, people lose their lands, homes, and natural resources. Catastrophic events force people to move voluntarily or involuntarily. The relocation of communities is a debatable climate adaptation measure which requires utmost care with human rights, ethics, and psychological well-being of individuals upon the issues of discrimination, conflict, and security. As the number of climate-displaced populations grows, the generations-deep connection to their rituals, customs, and ancestral ties with the land, cultural practices, and intangible cultural heritage become endangered. However, intangible heritage is often overlooked in the context of climate displacement. This paper presents reflections based on observations regarding the intangible heritage of voluntarily displaced communities. It begins by examining intangible heritage under the threat of climate displacement, with place-based examples. It then reveals intangible heritage as a catalyst to building resilient communities by advocating for the cultural values of indigenous and all people in climate action planning. It concludes the discussion by presenting the implications of climate displacement in existing intangible heritage initiatives. This article seeks to contribute to the emerging policies of preserving intangible heritage in the context of climate displacement.","Aktürk, Gül; Lerski, Martha",J Environ Stud Sci,596,16

The current outbreak of infections with SARS-CoV-2 is termed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 in China as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Two other coronavirus infections—SARS in 2002-2003 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012—both caused severe respiratory syndrome in humans. All 3 of these emerging infectious diseases leading to a global spread are caused by β-coronaviruses. Although coronaviruses usually infect the upper or lower respiratory tract, viral shedding in plasma or serum is common. Therefore, there is still a theoretical risk of transmission of coronaviruses through the transfusion of labile blood products. Because more and more asymptomatic infections are being found among COVID-19 cases, considerations of blood safety and coronaviruses have arisen especially in endemic areas. In this review, we detail current evidence and understanding of the transmission of SARS-CoV, MERS–CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 through blood products as of February 10, 2020, and also discuss pathogen inactivation methods on coronaviruses.","Chang, Le; Yan, Ying; Wang, Lunan",Transfus Med Rev,596,11

Inertial microfluidics has been increasingly employed for such investigations to isolate target bioparticles from liquid samples with size and/or deformability-based manipulation. This phenomenon is especially useful for the clinic, owing to its rapid, label-free nature of target enrichment that enables further downstream assays. Inertial microfluidics leverages the principle of inertial focusing, which relies on the balance of inertial and viscous forces on particles to align them into size-dependent laminar streamlines. Several distinct microfluidic channel geometries (e.g., straight, curved, spiral, contraction-expansion array) have been optimized to achieve inertial focusing for a variety of purposes, including particle purification and enrichment, solution exchange, and particle alignment for on-chip assays. In this review, we will discuss how inertial microfluidics technology has contributed to improving accuracy of various assays to provide clinically relevant information.

To guide treatment and prevent spread of the viral infection, a rapid and sensitive detection method is required for clinical samples. Here, we described and evaluated a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) method to detect Zaire ebolavirus using the nucleoprotein gene (NP) as a target sequence. Two different techniques were used, a calcein/Mn(2+) complex chromogenic method and real-time turbidity monitoring. The RT-LAMP assay detected the NP target sequence with a limit of 4.56 copies/μL within 45 min under 61°C, a similar even or increase in sensitivity than that of real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Additionally, all pseudoviral particles or non- Zaire EBOV genomes were negative for LAMP detection, indicating that the assay was highly specific for EBOV. To appraise the availability of the RT-LAMP method for use in clinical diagnosis of EBOV, of 417 blood or swab samples collected from patients with clinically suspected infections in Sierra Leone, 307 were identified for RT-LAMP-based surveillance of EBOV. Therefore, the highly specific and sensitive RT-LAMP method allows the rapid detection of EBOV, and is a suitable tool for clinical screening, diagnosis, and primary quarantine purposes.","Li, Huan; Wang, Xuesong; Liu, Wei; Wei, Xiao; Lin, Weishi; Li, Erna; Li, Puyuan; Dong, Derong; Cui, Lifei; Hu, Xuan; Li, Boxing; Ma, Yanyan; Zhao, Xiangna; Liu, Chao; Yuan, Jing",Front Microbiol,596,20

The new and fast dynamics of the pandemic are challenging the health systems of different countries. In the absence of vaccines or effective treatments, mitigation policies, such as social isolation and lock-down of cities, have been adopted, but the results vary among different countries. Some countries were able to control the disease at the moment, as is the case of South Korea. Others, like Italy, are now experiencing the peak of the pandemic. Finally, countries with emerging economies and social issues, like Brazil, are in the initial phase of the pandemic. In this work, we use mathematical models with time-dependent coefficients, techniques of inverse and forward uncertainty quantification, and sensitivity analysis to characterize essential aspects of the COVID-19 in the three countries mentioned above. The model parameters estimated for South Korea revealed effective social distancing and isolation policies, border control, and a high number in the percentage of reported cases. In contrast, underreporting of cases was estimated to be very high in Brazil and Italy. In addition, the model estimated a poor isolation policy at the moment in Brazil, with a reduction of contact around 40%, whereas Italy and South Korea estimated numbers for contact reduction are at 75% and 90%, respectively. This characterization of the COVID-19, in these different countries under different scenarios and phases of the pandemic, supports the importance of mitigation policies, such as social distancing. In addition, it raises serious concerns for socially and economically fragile countries, where underreporting poses additional challenges to the management of the COVID-19 pandemic by significantly increasing the uncertainties regarding its dynamics.","Reis, Ruy Freitas; de Melo Quintela, Bárbara; de Oliveira Campos, Joventino; Gomes, Johnny Moreira; Rocha, Bernardo Martins; Lobosco, Marcelo; dos Santos, Rodrigo Weber",Chaos Solitons Fractals,596,23

The aim of this study is to describe the impact of nonpharmaceutical interventions on ICU admissions of non–coronavirus disease 2019–related patients. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Analysis of all reported adult patient admissions to New Zealand ICUs during Level 3 and Level 4 lockdown restrictions from March 23, to May 13, 2020, in comparison with equivalent periods from 5 previous years (2015–2019). SUBJECTS: Twelve-thousand one-hundred ninety-two ICU admissions during the time periods of interest were identified. MEASUREMENTS: Patient data were obtained from the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society Adult Patient Database, Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society critical care resources registry, and Statistics New Zealand. Study variables included patient baseline characteristics and ICU resource use. MAIN RESULTS: Nonpharmaceutical interventions in New Zealand were associated with a 39.1% decrease in ICU admission rates (p < 0.0001). Both elective (–44.2%) and acute (–36.5%) ICU admissions were significantly reduced when compared with the average of the previous 5 years (both p < 0.0001). ICU occupancy decreased from a mean of 64.3% (2015–2019) to 39.8% in 2020. Case mix, ICU resource use per patient, and ICU and hospital mortality remained unchanged.

It is biologically plausible that the dose of oxygen used might affect important patient outcomes. Most peri-operative research has focussed on oxygen regimens that target higher than normal blood oxygen levels. Whereas, intensive care research has mostly focussed on conservative oxygen regimens which assiduously avoid exposure to higher than normal blood oxygen levels. While such conservative oxygen therapy is preferred for spontaneously breathing patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the optimal oxygen regimen in other patient groups is not clear. Some data suggest that conservative oxygen therapy might be preferred for patients with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy. However, unless oxygen supplies are constrained, routinely aggressively down-titrating oxygen in either the peri-operative or intensive care setting is not necessary based on available data. Targeting higher than normal levels of oxygen might reduce surgical site infections in the perioperative setting and/or improve outcomes for intensive care patients with sepsis but further research is required and available data are not sufficiently strong to warrant routine implementation of such oxygen strategies.","Young, Paul J.; Frei, Daniel",J Anesth,596,1

Scaffolds were built around an ACE2 helix that interacts with the RBD, or de novo designed scaffolds were docked against the RBD to identify new binding modes. In both cases, designed sequences were optimized first in silico and then experimentally for target binding, folding and stability. Nine designs bound the RBD with affinities ranging from 100pM to 10nM, and blocked bona fide SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero E6 cells with IC 50 values ranging from 35 pM to 35 nM; the most potent of these - 56 and 64 residue hyperstable proteins made using the second approach - are roughly six times more potent on a per mass basis (IC 50 ~ 0.23 ng/ml) than the best monoclonal antibodies reported thus far. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of the SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain trimer in complex with the two most potent minibinders show that the structures of the designs and their binding interactions with the RBD are nearly identical to the computational models, and that all three RBDs in a single Spike protein can be engaged simultaneously.

In addition, temperature is the only significant climate indicator which has significant correlation with the spread of COVID-19. Finally, PM10, humidity, and environmental quality index have a significant relationship only with the active cases from COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings conclude that Germany’s successful response to COVID-19 is attributed to environmental legislation and the medical care system, which oversaw significant overhaul after the SARS and MERS outbreaks.

However, the link between IL-33 and type-2 inflammation has not been shown in naturally occurring asthma exacerbations. Objectives To determine if airway IL-33 is associated with type-2 inflammation measured by type-2 cytokines, FeNO and sputum eosinophils in patients presenting to the Emergency Department with an asthma exacerbations. Methods Adult patients hospitalized due to acute asthma were enrolled. Upper airways were sampled with nasal swabs and lower airways with induced sputum. Cytokines were measured at protein level using a Luminex® assay and mRNA expression level using droplet-digital-PCR. Airway sampling was repeated four weeks after exacerbation. Results At the time of exacerbation, upper airway IL-33 correlated with upper airway IL-5 and IL-13 (R = 0.84, p < 0.01 and R = 0.76, p < 0.01, respectively) and with lower airway IL-13 (R = 0.49, p = 0.03). Similar associations were observed for mRNA expression. Lower airway IL-33 positively correlated with lower airway IL-13 (R = 0.84, p < 0.01).

PURPOSE: To provide an overview of compounding under sections 503A and 503B of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and to describe the pharmacist’s role within the US Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) Compounding Incidents Program, whose efforts are aimed at protecting the public against poor-quality compounded drugs through surveillance, review and response to adverse events and complaints. SUMMARY: Compounded drugs may serve an important medical need for patients who cannot be treated with medications approved by FDA; however, compounded drugs are not approved by FDA and are not subject to premarket review for safety, efficacy, or manufacturing quality; thus, they may pose safety risks to patients. Prompt reporting of adverse events or complaints related to compounding is important in identifying these risks and implementing safeguards to protect the public. FDA’s Compounding Incidents Program consists of a team of pharmacists dedicated to the surveillance and review of adverse events and complaints and follow-up actions related to safety risks associated with compounded drugs. Pharmacists are a vital component of FDA’s Compounding Incidents Program, utilizing their clinical skill set and regulatory knowledge to review and act on safety issues that affect public health.

The presence of HLH was described in severely ill patients during the H1N1 influenza epidemic, presenting with pulmonary vascular thrombosis. We tested the hypothesis that genes causing primary HLH regulate pathways linking pulmonary thromboembolism to the presence of SARS-CoV-2 using novel network-informed computational algorithms. This approach led to the identification of Neutrophils Extracellular Traps (NETs) as plausible mediators of vascular thrombosis in severe COVID-19 in children and adults. Taken together, the network-informed analysis led us to propose the following model: the release of NETs in response to inflammatory signals acting in concert with SARS-CoV-2 damage the endothelium and direct platelet-activation promoting abnormal coagulation leading to serious complications of COVID-19. The underlying hypothesis is that genetic and/or environmental conditions that favor the release of NETs may predispose individuals to thrombotic complications of COVID-19 due to an increase risk of abnormal coagulation. This would be a common pathogenic mechanism in conditions including autoimmune/infectious diseases, hematologic and metabolic disorders.","Ding, Jun; Hostallero, David Earl; El Khili, Mohamed Reda; Fonseca, Gregory Joseph; Milette, Simon; Noorah, Nuzha; Guay-Belzile, Myriam; Spicer, Jonathan; Daneshtalab, Noriko; Sirois, Martin; Tremblay, Karine; Emad, Amin; Rousseau, Simon",PLoS Comput Biol,596,16

This study aims at estimating the prevalence of severe adverse events (SAEs) and their associated factors among health professionals (HPs) vaccinated with COVISHIELD(TM) vaccine in Togo. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from March 13th to 19th, 2021 in Togo among HPs who received the first dose of vaccine. An online self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data on sociodemographic characteristics and vaccination. SAEs were defined as one resulting in hospitalization, medical consultation, or inability to work the day following the administration of the vaccine. Regression analysis were performed to assess factors associated with SAEs. Results: A total of 1,639 HP (70.2% male) with a median age [IQR] of 32 years [27-40] participated. At least one AE was reported among 71.6% (95%CI= [69.3-73.8]). The most commonly reported AEs were pain at the injection site (91.0%), asthenia (74.3%), headache (68.7%), soreness (55.0%), and fever (47.5%). An increased libido was also reported in 3.0% of HP. Among HP who experienced AEs, 18.2% were unable to go to work the day after vaccination, 10.5% consulted a medical doctor, and 1.0% were hospitalized. The SAE prevalence was 23.8% (95%CI= [21.8-25.9]). Being <30 years (aOR=5.54; p<0.001), or 30-49 years (aOR=3.62; p<0.001) and being female (aOR=1.97; p<0.001) were associated with SAEs.

A total of 70 adenoid tissue samples were collected from children with clinical symptoms caused by hypertrophy of adenoids but without symptoms of airway infection. Samples were investigated for SAFV by RT-nested PCR and sequence analysis. Eleven of 70 (15.7%) samples were positive for SAFV. Nasopharyngeal swabs were available from 45 children just before surgery. SAFV was rarely found and only in children with SAFV-positive adenoids 2/8. Our findings indicate that the presence of SAFV seems to be more frequent in adenoid tissue than expected. This could support the notion of a longer than previously anticipated persistence of SAFV nucleic acids in the respiratory tract and possibly a chronic infection. Further investigations are necessary to establish the role of SAFV infection in humans.","Lindner, Kira; Ludwig, Michael; Bootz, Friedrich; Reber, Ulrike; Safavieh, Zahrasadat; Eis-Hübinger, Anna Maria; Herberhold, Stephan",PLoS One,596,1

Placentas from pregnancies complicated with chorioamnionitis (ChA), exhibited increased expression of ACE2 mRNA. Treatment of 2nd trimester placental explants with LPS, induced an acute increase in cytokine expression followed by ACE2 mRNA. Placental ACE2 protein localized to syncytiotrophoblast, in fetal blood vessels and M1/M2 macrophage and neutrophils within the villous stroma. Increased numbers of M1 macrophage and neutrophils were present in the placenta of ChA pregnancies. Maternal peripheral immune cells (mainly granulocytes and monocytes) express the ACE2 mRNA and protein. These data suggest that in COVID19 positive pregnancies complicated by ChA, ACE2 positive immune cells have the potential to traffic SARS-CoV-2 virus to the placenta and increase the risk of vertical transmission to the placenta/fetus.","Lye, P.; Dunk, C.; Zhang, J.; Wei, Y.; Nakpu, J.; Hamada, H.; Imperio, G.; Bloise, E.; Matthews, S.

Therefore, in this review, we aim to point out some important issues related to convalescent plasma (CP) and its use in COVID‐19. CP may be an adjunctive treatment option to the anti‐viral therapy. The protective effect of CP may continue for weeks and months. After the assessment of the donor, 200‐600 mL plasma can be collected with apheresis devices. The donation interval may vary between countries. Even though limited published studies are not prospective or randomized, until the development of vaccines or therapeutics, CP seems to be a safe and probably effective treatment for critically ill patients with COVID‐19.

The current diagnostic microbial standard detects S. pneumoniae in less than 30% of CAP cases. A quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting autolysin (lytA) is able to increase the rate of detection. The aim of this study is validation of this quantitative PCR in vitro using different available strains and in vivo using clinical samples (oropharyngeal swabs). The PCR autolysin (lytA) was validated by testing the intra- and inter-run variability. Also, the in vitro specificity and sensitivity, including the lower limit of detection was determined. In addition, a pilot-study was performed using samples from patients (n = 28) with pneumococcal pneumonia and patients (n = 28) with a pneumonia without detection of S. pneumoniae with the current diagnostic microbial standard, but with detection of either a viral and or another bacterial pathogen to validate this test further. The intra- and inter-run variability were relatively low (SD’s ranging from 0.08 to 0.96 cycle thresholds). The lower limit of detection turned out to be 1–10 DNA copies/reaction. In-vitro sensitivity and specificity of the tested specimens (8 strains carrying lytA and 6 strains negative for lytA) were both 100%. In patients with pneumococcal and non-pneumococcal pneumonia a cut-off value of 6.000 copies/mL would lead to a sensitivity of 57.1% and a specificity of 85.7%. We were able to develop a quantitative PCR targeting lytA with good in-vitro test characteristics.

The present contribution proposes that conspiracy theories are explanatory narratives that necessarily contain justice judgments, as they include attributions of blame and accusations of unethical or criminal conduct. Conspiratorial narratives also are mental simulations, however, and may elicit genuine feelings of injustice also without evidence of actual malpractice. Indeed, conspiracy theories sometimes describe unfair events that are unlikely to have occurred, unethical authorities that might not actually exist, and so on. Here I propose two complementary processes that stimulate belief in evidence-free conspiracy theories: (1) Existential threats instigate biased mental processing and motivated reasoning, that jointly promote an alternative perception of reality; and (2) group allegiances shape how people perceive, interpret, and remember facts to highlight the immoral qualities of competing outgroups. Due to these processes, conspiracy theories elicit a set of distinct reactions such as poor health choices and rejection of science. Moreover, evidence-free conspiracy theories require interventions beyond traditional approaches to install justice principles, such as debunking falsehoods and reducing polarized intergroup distinctions. I conclude that the scientific study of conspiracy theories is part of, and has a unique place in, social justice research.","van Prooijen, Jan-Willem",Soc Justice Res,596,22

Due to the dynamic development of infections and the time lag between when patients are infected and when a proportion of them enters an intensive care unit (ICU), the need for future intensive care can easily be underestimated. To infer future ICU load from reported infections, we suggest a simple statistical model that (1) accounts for time lags and (2) allows for making predictions depending on different future growth of infections. We have evaluated our model for three heavily affected regions in Europe, namely Berlin (Germany), Lombardy (Italy), and Madrid (Spain). Before extensive containment measures made an impact, we first estimate the region-specific model parameters, namely ICU rate, time lag between infection, and ICU admission as well as length of stay in ICU. Whereas for Berlin, an ICU rate of 6%, a time lag of 6 days, and a stay of 12 days in ICU provide the best fit of the data, for Lombardy and Madrid the ICU rate was higher (18% and 15%) and the time lag (0 and 3 days) and the stay in ICU (3 and 8 days) shorter. The region-specific models are then used to predict future ICU load assuming either a continued exponential phase with varying growth rates (0–15%) or linear growth. By keeping the growth rates flexible, this model allows for taking into account the potential effect of diverse containment measures. Thus, the model can help to predict a potential exceedance of ICU capacity depending on future growth. A sensitivity analysis for an extended time period shows that the proposed model is particularly useful for exponential phases of the disease.","Ritter, Matthias; Ott, Derek V.

Both infections have crossed the species barrier to infect humans. SARS originated from southern China and spread to many countries in early 2003. The close collaboration of scientists around the world resulted in a rapid identification of the causative agent, and the early isolation of infected cases and meticulous infection control measures were the key to successfully controlling the outbreak of SARS. The first outbreak of human cases of avian influenza was reported in 1997 in Hong Kong. Since 2003, there have been many small outbreaks of human cases around the world, and the reported mortality is greater than 50%. Current evidence suggests that the human-to-human transmission of avian influenza is rather inefficient, but mutation might occur in the future resulting in improved transmission and possibly a pandemic in humans. As with the outbreak of SARS, the development of sensitive and accurate early diagnostic tests is extremely important for successful control of the outbreak at source. The availability of isolation facilities, the stockpiling of antiviral agents and effective and safe vaccination will be extremely important in minimising the damage of a new influenza pandemic.","Wong, Gary W.K.; Leung, Ting F.",Paediatr Respir Rev,596,1
